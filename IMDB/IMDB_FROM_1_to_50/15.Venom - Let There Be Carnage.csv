0,nogodnomasters,Enjoy the Show.,7,15 October 2021,"Eddie Brock gets a chance to interview Cletes Kasady (Woody Harrelson) abused as a child and serial killer as an adult. In looking at the graffiti on his cell walls, Venom is able to figure out where the bodies are buried. The death penalty is reinstated as Cletus head for lethal injection. Cletus also has a love interest in Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) aka ""the shriek: because of her high pitch deadly voice. On Brock's final visit to Cletus, he infects the serial killer with a piece of Venom which turn him into Carnage who goes on a rampage of revenge.I didn't like this as much as the first film. The climax fight scene had multiple sides and lasted an inane amount of time with equally inane action. I guess this is what audiences' want. I liked seeing Woody not acting old. I thought someone like Octavia Spencer would have made an interesting Francis Barrison.Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity unless you notice that Venom doesn't wear pants.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
1,kosmasp,PG Carnage that is,6,26 October 2021,"If you had issues with the first one and the (low) level of violence it had (PG13 and all that), do not expect this to be any better. This also is PG13. Since I am not too aware of Venom as he was depicted in the comics, I was free of that and quite enjoyed the first one.And while the bonus scene in the end credits of the first Venom movie hinted at Woody Harrelson being the main bad guy in this one (with a now different look for no reason I can think of), he is quite underused to be honest. The main focus of the movie relies on the relationship of Venom and Tom Hardys character. The side story is the love story between Harrelsons character and a woman with an ability ... that should open quite a few doors emotionally and otherwise, but never gets fully explored ... because people have to fight and CGI and all that.So the human drama only works between Hardy and Venom - everything else (even the cop) are side notes at best. Having said all that, the movie works if you don't mind those things too much and cut it some slack. It still feels like a step back from the previous entry.That is until the ending. And I don't mean the end fight (although the CG is quite stunning all things considered) ... I am talking about the bonus scene in the credits. I am not going to tell you what happens and I really hope you can watch it without knowing. As with the looking into the future that the first Venom had in store for us ... this does too! But with quite the promise ... although depending on how you feel about ... certain things you may feel different than me. Still it has to be seen to be believed! Oh the hype is real - and that bonus scene almost made me give this a bigger/higher rating too ...",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
2,jboothmillard,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,5,28 October 2021,"The first film was an okay anti-superhero spin-off movie from Marvel for the famous enemy of Spider-Man, I didn't expect very much from the follow-up, but I was up for going to see it anyway, directed by Andy Serkis. Basically, in the opening flashback, in 1996, young Cletus Kasady (Jack Bandeira) is helplessly separated from his love, Frances Barrison (Olumide Olorunfemi), who has the ability of sound manipulation, when she is taken away from St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children to the Ravencroft Institute. On the way, Barrison uses her sonic scream powers to escape and attacks young police officer Patrick Mulligan (Sean Delaney). The officer shoots Barrison in the eye and her scream causes an injury to his ear, he assumes she is dead, but is taken to a facility with sound-proof walls. In the present, Detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham) contacts investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) to speak to serial killer Kasady (Woody Harrelson), who refuses to talk to anyone other than Brock following their interview a year ago. Brock, still living with alien symbiote Venom, has his career boosted by Venom figuring out where Kasady's murder victims bodies' are hidden. Brock later meets his ex-fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) who tells him that she is now engaged to Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott), much to Venom's displeasure. Kasady was previously found guilty of his crimes and sentenced to death by lethal injection; he invites Brock over to San Quentin State Prison to attend his execution. Meeting on death row, Kasady provokes Venom, with numerous insults directed at Brock. Kasady bites Brock's hand, ingesting a small part of the symbiote. Back home, Venom and Brock argue as the alien wants more freedom and to eat bad people, and their fight ends with the symbiote detaching from his body. During Kasady's execution, the red symbiote emerges and blocks the injection, and infecting the criminal's body goes on a violent rampage through the prison, freeing inmates and killing guards. The red symbiote, calling itself Carnage, makes a deal with Kasady, to help him break out Barrison aka Shriek (Naomie Harris) from Ravencroft, and Kasady will help him eliminate Brock and Venom. Mulligan calls Brock and warns him about the situation. In Ravencroft, Kasady frees Barrison, they embrace and travel to their old children's home to burn it down. Mulligan, suspicious of Brock due to his interactions with Kasady before his escape, takes Brock to the police station. Brock refuses to answer Mulligan's questions and contacts Weying as his lawyer. Brock reveals that Venom has separated from him and needs him back to fight Carnage together. Venom has made his way to San Francisco, hopping from body to body, and is embracing his freedom. Eventually Weying finds him and bonds with him, after convincing him to forgive Brock, as the head to break Brock out of the police station. Brock and Venom make amends and reform. Kasady takes Mulligan hostage, and Barrison, failing to find Brock, kidnaps Weying. Lewis was given a message from Barrison about their whereabouts, to give to Brock, as they plan to get married at a cathedral. There, Venom appears and fights Carnage, holding his own against his spawn, who has strong disagreements with Kasady. Barrison seemingly kills Mulligan by hanging, and Venom is eventually overpowered brutally by Carnage, who decides to kill Weying at the top of the cathedral. But Venom regains his strength and saves Weying and provokes Barrison to use her powers, as her sonic blast causes both symbiotes to separate from their hosts. This causes the cathedral to collapse and Barrison falls to the ground and is killed by a falling bell. Venom saves Brock by bonding with him before the impact. Carnage tries to bond with Kasady again, but Venom devours the symbiote. Kasady says that he only wanted to be Brock's friend, but Venom bites Kasady's head off. While Brock, Venom, Weying, and Lewis escape, Mulligan is still alive, his eyes flash blue. Brock and Venom decide to take a vacation while they think about what will happen next. As Venom tells Brock about other universes, a blinding light transports them from their hotel room to another room, and they watch a news report with J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) revealing the identity of Spider-Man as Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to which Venom takes an interest. Also starring Peggy Lu as Mrs. Chen, Sian Webber as Dr. Pazzo and Reece Shearsmith as Priest. Hardy is likeable as both the ordinary reporter and the amusingly snarly being in his body, Harrelson has fun being the camp villain, Harris is interesting if perhaps underwritten, and Graham doesn't do much. As with the original film, the special effects are brilliant to propel the fast-paced chase, fight and explosive sequences and bring to life unworldly creatures, it has great comedic sparring with no-holds-barred language, it is a warped buddy movie style story that works the slightest bit better than its predecessor, predictable and flimsy at times, but a reasonable superhero fantasy action horror. Worth watching!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
3,CinemaSerf,A (very) distant cousin of the first one...,6,17 October 2021,"I was really looking forward to this. I enjoyed the first one and the trails for this sequel looked fun... What happened? It is all over the place. It starts off promisingly enough with an enjoyable set piece with ""Eddie"" (Tom Hardy) and Michelle Williams (""Anne"") - aided by some pithy one-liners from an unseen ""Venom"" but after we are introduced to ""Cletus"" (Woody Harrelson) the thing really hits the skids. The entertaining elements from the first film, the humour and - dare I say it, the symbiotic relationship/tolerance of man and amoeba are thrown under the bus for this angry CGI fest. Add to this pretty dry mix the rather pointless character of Harrelson's childhood sweetheart ""Frances"" (Naomie Harris) alias ""the Scream"" (remember the symbiotes don't like fire of sound), with her own agenda against copper ""Mulligan"" (Stephen Graham) and the whole thing just boils down to a very good looking film - but one with a plot that was almost non-existent, and that robbed the formidably sarcastic ""Venom"" of much of the charm that made the original work. Come to think on it - Hardy hardly features at all. I didn't hate it - it has a pace that passes 90 minutes effortlessly enough, but sorry, I was really disappointed.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
4,zardoz-13,The Sequel Surpasses The Original!,10,7 October 2021,"Sequels can be scary. First, they must live up to the original. Second, they must be as entertaining as the original. Third, they must develop the original characters and storyline without copycatting the original. Fourth, they should surpass the original. Most franchises crash and burn here. Comparably, Marvel's superhero sequel sagas have lived up to this credo. Notable exceptions are the ""Hulk"" sequels and the ""Fantastic Four"" sequels. Happily, ""Breathe"" director Andy Serkis' sequel ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" (**** OUT OF ****) surpasses the fabulous Reuben Fleischer original. Clocking in at 95 lean but hyperactive minutes, ""Venom: LTBC"" conjures up more outlandish action and makes you feel like you're trapped in a runaway centrifuge. Happily, not only is Tom Hardy back in the lead as the trouble-prone protagonist Eddie Brock, but also Michele Williams reprises her role as Eddie's ex-girlfriend Anne Weying and Reid Scott returns as Anne's fiancé Dr. Dan Lewis. Anne still cares about Eddie, but she is still attached to Dr. Dan, much to Venom's chagrin. Of course, Peggy Lu shows up again as Mrs. Chen, the storefront shop owner who plies Venom with chocolate. The larger-than-life action transpires once again in San Francisco. Neither Eddie nor Venom are entirely content with each other. The relationship between the disgraced journalist and the sentient alien symbiote in exile is even more contentious. They make quite an industrial strength ""The Odd Couple."" Eddie must constantly restrain the amorphous, liquid-like creature bonded to him that can assume a humanoid shape. Speaking with a deep, gravelly voice, Venom behaves like a berserk space gorilla. An unabashed carnivore at heart, Venom has a voracious appetite that can never assuaged. Living with Venom is like contending with a temper tantrum-prone two-year and Eddie is frustrated with his outbursts. Primarily, Eddie has put Venom on a diet of chicken and chocolate. Predictably, Venom abhors it. The good vampires in the ""Twilight"" trilogy abided by similar rules. Eddie spends a lot of time patching up the damages Venom does to the premises as well as replacing his television.If you remember the first movie, you know the original concluded with Eddie Brock visiting notorious serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson of ""Natural Born Killers"") at San Quentin Prison. Bad memories plague Cletus about being locked away at St. Estes Home for Unwanted Children. Using creepy looking sketches, Serkis shows Cletus pushing his granny in her wheelchair down the stairs and killing her. No doubt, this scene drew inspiration from ""Kiss of Death"" (1947) a crime thriller about a sadistic gangster shoved an old woman in her wheelchair down a staircase to her death. Afterward, Cletus tossed an electric hair dryer into his mother's bathtub while she was bathing herself. Indeed, he electrocuted her to death. This scene was lifted from a similar scene in the James Bond epic ""Goldfinger"" (1964) when Agent 007 fried a villain in a bathtub with an electric appliance. Poor little Cletus suffers at the hands of the other Ravencroft inmates until he meets his guardian angel of love, Frances Barrison (Naomie Harris of ""Skyfall""), who rescues him from a beating. She shrieks like a banshee, and her sonic powers are not only deafening but also deadly. The authorities sedate her and ship her off to a hardened facility equipped to withstand her sonic mayhem. Meantime, years later, Cletus summons Eddie to visit him. When he leaving, Eddie notices some handwriting on the wall of Cletus' cell, and Venom memorizes every bit of it. Later, Venom and Eddie deduce where Cletus disposed of the bodies of his victims. Eddie's story about Cletus is published, and Cletus finds himself facing lethal injection. Cletus invites Eddie to his execution. During their brief chat, Venom surprises Eddie, bursts out of his body and attacks Cletus in his cell. Hannibal Lector type villain that he is, Cletus bites Eddie in self-defense. The death row inmate tastes blood like he has never savored. Now, Cletus shares his body with a red symbiote. This DNA spin-off of Venom is bonded to him like Venom is to Eddie. When Carnage emerges from Cletus, the shape-shifting symbiote is a dead finger for Venom. Carnage enabled Cletus to escape from death chamber, kill the warden, and spawn mayhem galore. After their escape, Cletus and Carnage rescue Frances from Ravencroft. While all this is happening, Venom and Eddie have separated. Leaving Eddie, Venom bounces between bodies, but he cannot find a host as ideal as Eddie. Anne tracks down Venom. He has bonded with Mrs. Chen and Anne implores him to reunite with Eddie to vanquish Cletus and Carnage.Director Andy Serkis stomps the pedal to the metal in this ramped-up, slam-bang, high-octane escapade. This sequel qualifies as one of the shortest Marvel movies ever! Serkis never lets the action bog down in extraneous subplots and supporting characters. The visual CGI effects in ""Venom"" provided half of the spectacle in the original film. Meantime, Serkis and original ""Venom"" scenarist Kelly Marcel keep the characters jumping through flaming hoops, and this hysteria propels the action like a runaway train. Although it features some supernatural life and death violence, ""Venom: LTBC"" ladens the storyline with tongue-in-cheek humor. Tom Hardy has his hands full throughout the sequel. Eddie Brock takes a lot of flak not only from Cletus and Carnage but also Venom himself. Once, Woody Harrelson sports a haircut that makes him the spitting image of late Playboy magazine mogul Hugh Hefner. Michele Williams, Reid Scott, and Mrs. Chen participate as much as supporting characters can without stealing the show from the primary characters. If you watch ""Venom: Let the Carnage Begin,"" don't leave your seat when the end credits roll. Alas, you'll miss a pretty substantial foretaste of an impending Venom and Spider-man face-off!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
5,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,And there was. And he saw that it was... surprisingly watchable,7,15 October 2021,"Eddie Brock(Hardy, still delivering on the physical, living up to his namesake(as in ""Laurel and""), and loving playing Venom) wants to rebuild his career, so it doesn't take much to convince him to meet with imprisoned serial killer Cletus Kasady(Harrelson, who ""Knox"" it out the park). Maybe he can help find the remaining missing bodies? Unfortunately, this leads to... Carnage.This is at least as big of a mess as the first one was. It's less ironically fun, because this time it's on purpose. Then again, it is also substantially more enjoyable for that same reason. It's been a long time since I've seen something that had such wild writing. Try to go in knowing as little as possible. You will definitely not guess the places it goes. The comedy is much more successful, with the highlights being Ms Chen(Lu, master of the deadpan. Please give her a spin-off. You don't even have to take her out of her convenience store. Have her just react to bizarre things that happen right in front of her) and Anne(Williams, way more into it this time, which is definitely in part down to the incredible material they give her). It's hard to overstate how hilarious these two are. The action and CG is a lot better. If all you really want out of this is to see these iconic characters in live action, it will deliver on that. If you can roll with how ridiculous it is, as I did, you will be extremely entertained. If you cannot, this is going to exhaust you, and that is the only way that the 88(!) minute running time(if you don't count the end credits, and since those have only one additional scene(which is mindblowing), and it comes soon after they start running, you might as well leave the moment you've seen that one. The cinema staff will be grateful for it) won't fly by, to the point that it'll seem like you just sat down and then the movie ended. In fact, in that case, it will probably feel twice as long as it is, if not more.This features disturbing content, with a lot of implied violence and gore. I recommend this to anyone who thinks it will be their kind of thing. 7/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
6,neil-476,Violent fun,8,18 October 2021,"Eddie Brock is secretly hosting alien symbiote Venom. In practice, this means getting his apartment trashed regularly while trying to persuade his roomie to eat live chickens rather than bite peoples heads off. When he interviews serial killer Cletus Cassidy, a smidgen of symbiote combines with Cassidy to create pyscho-super-alien Carnage. And Cassidy's mutant girlfriend adds complications...I came out of the first Venom movie confused by its combination of violence, brutality, superheroics, and humour. This time I knew what to expect, and found myself laughing out loud quite often - much of the dialogue between Eddie and Venom is very funny, and Mrs Chen is an utter hoot.The film progresses along largely predictable lines, with lots of action and effects, mostly very well done (there are aome moments where it looked as if they ran out of time to complete the effects). There is plenty of scope for continuing the (sub)-franchise, especially given Tom Hardy's wholehearted and enthusiastic involvement (co-producer and story material). In fact, everyone looks to be having a ball.And, of course, the mid-credits scene is a real teaser!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
7,view_and_review,Fat-Fingered it,3,5 October 2021,"I was thoroughly disappointed with ""Venom: Let There be Carnage"". It was such a botched job from the beginning I wonder what was the thought process behind it.The movie begins with a scene from 1996 at an orphanage or some such place. A girl named Frances Barrison was removed from there because her powers had become too dangerous. In short order we find that she has powers similar to Banshee in that her scream is loud enough to cause damage. Her forcible removal from the institution drove her soulmate, Cletus Kasady, mad.We fast-forward to present day and Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is single again. Apparently, things didn't work out between him and Anne (Michelle Williams). That part was fine, but what wasn't was the new Chatty Cathy Venom we had to endure. Here is this sinister, brain-eating, alien symbiote that wants to be a comedian ALL THE TIME. It was flat out amazing how much Venom talked, and not in a good way. He doesn't have the voice for comic relief, yet that's what he was attempting to be and he was failing miserably. But Venom's attempts at stand-up paled in comparison to the fat-fingered manner in which they brought about Venom's antagonist Carnage.Present day Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) was a condemned man.And if I could just sidebar for a second: casting sixty-year-old Woody Harrelson as the antagonist in this movie was such a terrible choice. He was supposed to be fifty at the absolute oldest and he looked terrible in the hairpiece and flashy clothing.OK, back to the story. Cletus was such a prolific killer, the governor reversed the moratorium on the death penalty especially for him. Before his execution date, Cletus wanted to get a message to Frances (Naomie Harris) who was serving time in a cell specially made for her and her powers. Cletus promised Eddie a full story if he would print one simple message on the front page of his paper. Eddie agreed because a full story from an infamous serial killer is career-making. When Eddie visited with Cletus Venom was able to gather a few visual clues to help Eddie find all of Cletus's buried victims without a word from Cletus. This propelled Eddie to newspaper stardom and sealed Cletus's fate. In this very elementary way Eddie became Cletus's nemesis.Cletus wanted to see Eddie one last time before his execution to antagonize him for unearthing his secrets. Somehow, through knowledge Cletus divined from thin air, Cletus began ridiculing Eddie on a personal level that would require a fairly intimate knowledge of Eddie's past. This level of ridicule triggered Venom and he attacked Cletus. Cletus then grabbed Eddie's hand and bit him hard enough to draw blood. That blood, now on Cletus's lips, had enough alien matter in it to be the key ingredient for what happened next.When Cletus was pumped full of the lethal injection cocktail it mixed with his small bit of alien essence and created Carnage; an alien symbiote even more powerful than Venom. Carnage then made a grand exit from San Quentin Prison and we now had a CGI battle between two aliens that could not have been more forced.Let me recap: Frances aka Screech separated from Cletus. Cletus becomes a homicidal maniac. Cletus bites Eddie because he's that crazy. Eddie's blood with a small amount of alien matter is now in Cletus. Cletus gets injected with lethal cocktail and becomes Carnage. Venom fights Carnage to the death.This is a story that maybe gets a fifth grader an A, but a high-schooler an F. This is not the sort of shoddy movie-making I expect from Marvel, even if this isn't part of the MCU.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
8,morrison-dylan-fan,Venomous Carnage.,6,8 November 2021,"Getting an offer from my phone company for a free Monday movie ticket,I took a look at the listings for the day. In the mood for a snappy viewing, I decided to pick up the second issue of Venom.View on the film:Whilst involved in a number of big budget films over the last 20 years, director Andy Serkis joyfully embraces B-Movie thrills, with Serkis & Shutter Island (2010-also reviewed) cinematographer Robert Richardson unleashing Venom and Carnage in colourful cartoon violence form, of stylish arc shots diving into the red and black Action mash-up set-pieces.Joined by the sweet, playful turns of Michelle Williams, Stephen Graham and The League of Gentlemen's Reece Shearsmith, Tom Hardy gives a hilarious performance as Eddie Brock / Venom, thanks to Hardy playing on his serious image, by hitting every slap-stick set-piece and lovers tiff with a real relish, whilst Woody Harrelson (in a funny naff wig) chews the scenery as the boo-hiss baddie Cletus Kasady / Carnage.Running a lean 97 minutes, the screenplay by Kelly Marcel and Tom Hardy places Brock's romance with Weying to the sidelines, to instead unveil Brock's true romantic partner: Venom. Openly stating in the dialogue that he is out of the closet, the writers cross frantic CBM action with sweet, Gay Rom-Com exchanges of Venom wanting to go public with the relationship that he has with Brock, whilst at the same time delivering absolute carnage.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
9,thesar-2,There Will Be Carnage,7,3 October 2021,"When we got to the climax and it felt like the movie just breezed by, I immediately added another star to my rating. A short super(anti)hero movie? AMAZING!Venom: Let There Be Carnage isn't a great movie and has ALL the clichés of most superhero movies, but it was enjoyable. I found myself laughing a lot at Venom's one-liners and again, I enjoyed how SWIFT this movie was. That was refreshing.Despite some exposition, this is one of those sequels YOU MUST see the first one to understand this universe. And that's too bad. I rated the first one 2/5 stars and didn't care for it much. This is absolutely the better of the two.Eddie Brock & Co. - or the alien symbiote, Venom - are still fighting over superiority when they have a break-up. Simultaneously, the guy who used to bartend at Cheers turns into both a supervillain and Venom's greatest foe. Will Eddie make up with Venom in time to stop the Carnage?Yes, this movie has the age-old Superhero trope I hate so dearly: ""I don't wanna be a superhero anymore! I quit!"" usually found in the second chapter. Superman II did it, The Dark Knight did it, Iron Man 2 did it, hell, Spider-Man 2 did it, just to name a few of hundreds of examples. I hate it with a passion. So, when it happened here, I tried to remain calm. Mercifully, when Venom's on his own, he does have some fantastic and hilarious scenes. This one gets a pass because we hardly ever get to see the other side of this equation. All we usually get is the whiney non-superhero.That and some of the lazy writing's are probably the most problems of this. Everything else was fine or actually good. No one was terrible and the special effects were 10x better than the original. Recommended.***Final Thoughts: My friend with me said: We have to wait for the mid-credit scene. The second he told me that, I knew 100% who was showing up. Despite that, listen to my friend. You need to see it.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
10,FeastMode,fun but disappointing,6,1 October 2021,"I had a good time with this movie. It's fun and pretty funny with some entertaining action.It's also very messy with regards to the story, action and dialogue. The action isn't as good as the first. The story brings no value. And there were some stupid moments.I also can't stand that it's not rated R. I could say that about the first, but it did a great job of pushing the limits while also not having too many moments where it was obvious it would have been better with blood. This movie has SOOO many moments where it could have been amazing if they went all out. It felt so censored.I try to always have no expectations going into a movie. And i knew going in that even though i loved the first one, that doesn't make this one bulletproof. But looking back on it, a movie about carnage could have been so much more. It was underwhelming. Also i wish i got more development from cleetus and carnage.One more thing, tom hardy and andy serkis are awesome. But writing and directing are talents that very few have. I think it shows here and i would have preferred veterans at those crucial positions.I'll caveat this review by saying i couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue, especially from venom. We'll see if that changes anything when i watch it with subs. (1 viewing, 9/30/2021)",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
11,ericstevenson,There will be blood?,8,9 October 2021,"I wasn't expecting that much right before the movie came out. I actually really enjoyed it! This movie features Eddie Brock interviewing Cletus Kassidy and getting him executed. Cletus bites him and gets some substance from Venom's symbiote body and while about to be executed turns into the villain Carnage. I say that Carnage might be my favorite Spider-Man villain if only because he's the most evil. He actually does manage to get some sympathetic traits as he cares about his girlfriend as her powers aren't compatible with Carnage's.That's really an interesting idea for supervillain couples. Carnage doesn't appear until a half hour in and for a superhero (or mostly supervillain) movie, that's kind of short, but I still felt it got in what it needed to be. I admit it was weird seeing how goofy Venom and Eddie were interacting. They still worked, but weren't quite on type. The best part is of course, the scene at the very end.Venom's been teleported to the MCU. ***",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
12,cricketbat,This sequel is a loud and frantic mess,4,1 October 2021,"Much like the protagonist in Venom: Let There Be Carnage, I feel like there were two different screenwriters battling about what this movie should be, and they didn't really communicate with each other. This sequel is a loud and frantic mess, where superpowers can do whatever the plot demands, characters don't care about consistency, and the same jokes are repeated a dozen times. If you liked the first Venom movie, you'll probably like this one. I didn't, so I don't.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
13,UniqueParticle,Carnage of fun!,9,1 October 2021,"I absolutely loved this sequel, I wish that it was R rated but still worth it in IMAX and with a cozy blanket. The action and humor are excellent delights throughout. Andy Serkis direction flowed perfectly with large budgeted carnage. Length is just right too has the right scenes needed nothing boring at all or otherwise. I'm impressed Tom Hardy voiced Venom, plays Eddie Brock, has a writing credit, and is a producer that's wild! Hope my thoughts are appreciated either way highly recommend this fun time experience.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
14,Thanos_Alfie,Entertaining but...,7,23 October 2021,"""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the sequel of ""Venom"", in which we watch Eddie Brock going to interview a serial killer and later finding out that he is a host of another symbiote that helps him escape prison and the upcoming execution.Since I had already watched the first movie I knew what to expect from the second. I enjoyed it because it had a simple but interesting plot, plenty of action scenes that were combined very well with comedy and in general it was entertaining. Its short duration helped it to become interesting and not boring but if it would be rated with R it would be even better. The direction which was made by Andy Serkis was good and he followed the same pattern as in the first movie of ""Venom"" and his touch was obvious through the whole duration of the movie. The interpretations of Tom Hardy who played as Eddie Brock / Venom, Woody Harrelson who played as Cletus Kasady / Carnage and Naomie Harris who played as Frances Barrison / Shriek were very good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is not a bad movie but I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by it.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
15,cruise01,Venom is awesome as always with Carnage which is double the mayhem.,10,1 October 2021,5 out of 5 stars.Let There be Carnage is a great superhero film which is better than the first. The story follows Cletus/Carnage (Woody Harrelson) who escapes prison along with Shrieker (Naomi Harris) and causing mayhem. Venom/ Eddie (Tom Hardy) having to stop them before they go after him.The story is what you expect for this film. Continuing with Eddie and Venom being that bickering buddy couple. Sharing the same body. Sharing there perspectives and arguing during the situations. Even at one point they have a fight of trying to attack each other. When chaos is happening with Carnage. Who is menacing. They have to work together to stop it.The action is awesome. Carnage escape in prison is insane. The climatic fight between Carnage and Venom is a non stop thrill ride. The visual effects are amazing. The cast ensemble is perfect. Tom Hardy great as always. Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris are fantastic. With a shorter run time. The film does waste no time with a fast paced direction.There is a mid credit scene that everyone will have a reaction too for a hint where Venom can go next.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
16,Tweetienator,The Art of Genetic Movie Engineering,4,4 October 2021,"Marvel and DC these days remind me of those big players of the worldwide cheeseburger ""distribution network"" - the products always taste the same, because the ingredients are always accurately of the same nature and made the same way. Always. The same applies these days to those entertainment companies - you already know what to expect if a new show or movie leaves the factories of those big players of genetic movie engineering. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is not a candidate for the worst movie categories nor a total bore or fail, it is just a part of that endless and constant stream of ""entertainment"" these factories produce: easy to consume, easy to forget. Long gone are the times when I heard people talking about a new movie or show of those ""big"" players. Disappointed? No, it's just business as usual.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
17,southdavid,In my Carnage Truck... Truck Truck Truck.,5,20 October 2021,"I didn't really like the first ""Venom"" film that much. I found the banter between Brock and his symbiote to be more wearing than entertaining and the conclusion a CGI constructed mess. I liked this sequel a little more, but I wouldn't go as far as saying that I thought it was good.Whilst interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), some of Eddie Brock's (Tom Hardy) symbiotic blood is introduced to Kasady's system. This goes on to generate Carnage, a powerful red symbiote charged with the psychosis of its host. Escaping from prison, Carnage tries to rescue Kasady's long term girlfriend Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) and then find a way to get their revenge on Brock. However, Brock and Venom are not finding life together particularly copacetic.I really wanted to get there this time, to like this one. I like Andy Serkis, I like how committed to playing the character Tom Hardy is, acting as a producer this time and getting his friend Kelly Marcel to return to write the film with him. I liked the cameo roles for British actors, Rosie Marcel, Scroobius Pip and most high profile, Reece Shearsmith, in a role that was a real surprise, as I don't think he's talked about it anywhere.But I just didn't manage it. The bickering between Brock and Venom is rarely (but not never) funny, and again becomes tiresome quite a lot of the time. There's a lot or praise for the tight runtime, but I felt that came at the expense of the story, which is really basic and leads to the under utilisation of several characters - most notably Naomie Harris' Shriek villain, who appears retrofitted into the story to make the conclusion work. I understand the change in Carnage's origins, in order to differentiate the film from the first one, but I didn't like it. The CGI work isn't particularly amazing and the final fight has been done before.The post credits scene was intriguing, but for me, I'm as excited that the character can get into the hands of better storytellers, as for the actual reveal of it.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
18,stevendbeard,Some Extra Umph,8,1 October 2021,"I saw ""Venom:Let There Be Carnage"", starring Tom Hardy-Peaky Blinders_tv, The Revenant; Woody Harrelson-the Zombieland movies, the Hunger Games movies; Michelle Williams-The Greatest Showman, Brokeback Mountain and Naomie Harris-the Bond movies, Miami Vice_2006.This is a sequel to the 2018 Venom movie with some extra umph-It's better than the first one. Venom has a child, Carnage. Tom returns as Eddie Brock, the host for the alien symbiote Venom. Woody plays a serial killer named Cletus Kasady that becomes the host to Venom's off shoot, Carnage, and since Woody is a little on the nuts side, you can imagine how wack_o Carnage can be. Michelle returns as Tom's ex girlfriend that just wants to be friends with Tom-as most girls do-when she decides to marry another guy. Naomie plays Woody's girlfriend that has some attributes herself. There are lots of battles between the two symbiotes that look great. It's directed by Andy Serkis who has some impressive screen credits of his own: He has played villains in the Marvel Universe, Gollum in the lord of the Rings movies and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes movies. Some of the violence is a little gruesome.There is a scene just as the end credits start-nothing at the very end-that connects to another franchise.It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

20,kevin_robbins,This is a worthwhile sequel,8,10 October 2021,"Venom: Let there be Carnage (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw last week in theatres. The movie focuses on serial killer Cletus Cassidy and his rough upbringing. When Eddie Brock is chosen to be his reporter, and Cassidy takes a bite of him, the symbiote suit on Brock breaks off and infects Cassidy creating a ruthless killer like never seen before. Can Brock and Venom stay on the same page long enough to bring him down? This movie is directed by Andy Serkis (Heavenly Sword) and stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Woody Harrelson (Natural Born Killer), Naomi Harris (28 Days Later), Michelle Williams (Blue Valentine) and Stephen Graham (Snatch). The storyline for this is very compelling and is well written from a plot to character standpoint. The dialogue is first rate and hilarious as are the special effects, which are fantastic. The CGI fits the comics to perfection. The action scenes from beginning to end are wondeful; my one complaint, this is the darkest and most violent and gruesome Marvel comic series, and every kill and gore sequence is hidden by random things like cut away scenes or random tornados 🌪 to hide what are gruesome kills in the comic. The dialogue makes up for it but the lack of showing the kills keeps this from being the masterpiece it had the potential to be. This is a worthwhile sequel I would score a 7.5/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
21,alindsay-al,An Average Sequel,5,26 October 2021,"It's been a busy week but I have finally found the time to watch Venom: Let There Be Carnage and now here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Eddie Brock and Venom have to figure out their relationship while going against a serial killer and his own symbiote.Main Character
Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock and voices Venom and he does a pretty good job. I just find his performance as Brock entertaining and clearly somebody who is enjoying himself. He doesn't get much character development but I think there is just about enough here to give Hardy props for his role in the film. Venom is actually given more development and it is executed pretty well, I actually felt feeling towards the symbiote. He is also pretty funny and for me the dynamic between Venom and Eddie Brock is probably the highlight of the film.Supporting Characters
The first Venom film suffered from not creating interesting supporting characters and it is a shame that this film is the same. Woody Harrelson reprises his role of Cletus Kassidy/Carnage from the post credit scene of the first film and I just never got invested in his character. He just came across as a weirdo and a guy with no character. Harrelson is clearly enjoying himself but the character of Carnage is not given the justification that he deserves here. Naomi Harris plays Shriek and unfortunately, she is even worse. She just has these terrible one liners and her over the top bizarre performance is just too much for me and does nothing for me. The great Stephen Graham plays a police officer and it's not even that he is bad, he is actually alright but his character is dull and there is literally no reason to care and it is a shame that such a talent is wasted here. Michelle Williams is back as Anne from the first film and she is just as boring here, I just don't like the character and I have felt like Williams phones it in and signed a contract that she had to be here as she does very little here.Story
The relationship between Eddie and Venom is represented quite well here and I like how we saw more things from Venom's point of view this time around. But it is flawed, the dynamic between Carnage and Venom fails and the dynamic between Brock and Cassidy doesn't work either. The characters don't get enough time to develop and you won't care about anybody apart from Venom and maybe Eddie.Script
The script is okay, the humour was something I was worried about in the trailer but I can't deny that it worked for me. I chuckled quite a few times with Venom having some funny one liners. But the drama falls really flat and is so rushed that when it comes to the big showdown I kind of didn't care.Style
Both Venom and Carnage both look great and the clash between them is way easier to follow then the action in the first film. But the pacing is all over the place, it starts off at 100 miles an hour and then slows down and ties to focus on way too much. It needed a longer runtime to make the audience care about the characters.Overall
Overall, Venom; Let There Be Carnage is an average film that doesn't rise above its predecessor. It is okay and I don't think will bring any new fans but there is a huge post credit scene and that is all that people will be talking about coming out of this film.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
22,henry8-3,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,6,2 November 2021,"Tom Hardy and his symbiote Venom continue to coexist uneasily. In an argument with psycho Cletus Kassidy (Woody Harrelson), Kassidy ingests some of Venom's blood which gives him the ability to change into an even more terrifying alien - let battle commence.Really quite sharp and fast film hurtling along with wit and imagination with Hardy great fun as the wussy Brock and fun turns from wide eyed Harrelson and Naomi Harris as Cletus' girlfriend who can scream the house down.

Hes just not intimidating he doesn't look like a villian come on hes made for zombieland. Those movies he is great but hes absolutely HORRIBLE in venom he is out of place his lines aren't villainous at all he is not intimidating or just plane old doesn't fit the part.

25,andrewchristianjr,ENTERTAINING AND SERVICEABLE.,8,7 November 2021,"Not as bad as most people say. A vast improvement over the first film in the series. Everything is still entertaining and serviceable. After all, this sequel also features a post-credits scene that we shouldn't miss. Tom Hardy has a truly magnetic presence and Woody Harrelson gleefully chews all the scenery. CGI is an order of magnitude improved and there is a solid flow to the film that works with the somewhat short 90 minute runtime. Pure popcorn and a nice integration into the MCU canon. Worth a look.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
26,masonfisk,BETTER THAN THE LAST ONE BUT IT'S NOT SAYING MUCH...!,7,31 October 2021,"Tom Hardy returns in this current sequel to the 2018 original. Now finding a sort of peaceful co-existence w/the Venom symbiote, Eddie Brock, Hardy, has gotten his life sort of back on track (being an ace reporter again & living w/the fact his ex, again played by Oscar nominee Michelle Williams, has moved on). Into this fractious détente comes a call from a death row inmate, played again by Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson (who cameo'd in the last film), to tell his tale (where we've seen in flashback Harrelson's romance w/another disturbed inmate, played by Oscar nominee by Naomi Harris, cut short when she used her power, a banshee type scream to escape during a prison transfer but gets shot by a cop but not before deafening him). W/Harrelson's story published, he believes his & Hardy's life are entwined even inviting him to his last meal where he takes an opportunity to bite Hardy thus infecting him w/Venom & creating Carnage (which prompts an explosive outbreak from prison) whose sole goal is to reunite w/Harris & take revenge on their foes. Definitely better that the first film now directed by ace mo-cap performer Andy Serkis but it still has an air of 'what for?' hovering above it since Venom doesn't exist, at least for me, w/o the presence of Spider-man so the film ends up being an unabashed cash grab w/o a hint of irony or subtlety. Even the well done special effects, particularly the fidelity of the sound, started to rattle me physically where I felt I was being bombarded on a neutron level. Also starring Stephen Graham as the aggrieved detective.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
27,aidanratesmovies,"Not as good as the first, but a decent flick nevertheless",7,2 October 2021,"First off I just want to say what an amazing end credits scene this film has- like job well done whoever made that scene in particular- you deserve a raise. As for the film itself it can be a mixed bag at times, but I did enjoy it. Woody Harrelson's character takes more of a center focus than Tom Hardy and the titular character- which can be interesting but also a bit frustrating cause the film feels like its missing the point. No matter what you thought pf 2018's Venom, it was clear that Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom was the best part- so why underwhelm the audience with needless drama just to further the plot and come up with something more original? That being said, Harrelson's character is rather fascinating to watch unfold on screen- and they do give him a bit of a heart, which is also great to see as well. There are tons of funny moments throughout the film in its entirety. The soundtrack is nothing special, more of the same from the first film, but the plot is kinda all over the place. It feels like Director Andy Serkis doesn't quite know what to do with the films titular character- especially when it comes to tone. They could have made a lot of the scenes with Venom a whole lot more enjoyable and less harsh to watch. That being said, the film itself is very entertaining, I was never bored with any of it, even despite its flaws. Yeah its messy and yeah it can be predictable, but despite Serkis's bland directing- the film does manage to gain a lot of empathy from the audience and prove to be quite a blast to watch. If you are looking for an extraordinary film, this isn't the one for you, go see Shang-Chi instead, but if you're looking to kick back and relax- and maybe just enjoy yourself- this may be your cup of tea.My Rating: 6.6/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
28,masonsaul,The ideal sequel,8,15 October 2021,"It's bloodless Carnage can be quite annoying at times but Venom: Let There Be Carnage is the ideal sequel, doubling down on what worked in the first, removing what didn't and improving in almost every single way.Tom Hardy gives an incredible and committed lead performance once again and Michelle Williams, Naomie Harris and Stephen Graham are all really good. Woody Harrelson is a great villain and a huge improvement over the previous one.Andy Serkis' direction is fantastic, much stronger and technically competent, especially with the CG side, resulting in a better filmed and more stylish sequel with a much stronger and intense final battle.It's extremely well paced and wastes no time on filler with effectively funny jokes throughout that hit a lot more than miss. The CG is mostly impressive and the music by Marco Beltrami is really good.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
29,rgkarim,"A Carnage Of Mediocre Elements and Action, Offset by A Venom Of Comedy",7,1 October 2021,"LIKES:The Animation:
I'll give them props on their design for making the symbiotes come to life, Sony's latest dive into Venom's creation is very good. Tight forms, great fluidity of the black ooze that makes him up, and those sensational teeth are perfect for bringing him to life. The movement is fluid, it goes super well during the movement pieces, and the tendrils acting out the comedy moments are awesome. When Carnage appears, that chaotic redness is not quite a vivid as the comics, but definitely has the blood element and chaos of the malicious symbiote. It's grimy and viscous, and has the sinew of the tendrils that offers a little more of the nightmare that Carnage is known for, including his devilish bladed arms.The Music: I know a soundtrack for a Marvel movie is not the most noticeable feature, but much like the first film it's got attitude, beats, and some layers to it. Some symphony work goes alongside the fanfare sound effects to help make the inspiring pieces we love in super hero movies. It's the rap times though that really work and man are they awesome. Rap beats carry the harder attitude of the Venom world, with that no consequences edge that works to go with Venom's attitude. The end trailer song was my particular favorite and I liked given the sweet tones of the chorus and the verses bringing the hardcore beats.The Acting:
Certainly not the Oscar's level others have hit, but I enjoyed the performances of the cast on this installment of Venom's chronicles. Tom Hardy essentially acting with himself is certainly the highlight, with a natural flow to the chaos of the lines that he seemed to write for himself. Hardy as Eddie has the same nervous, loser attitude he conveyed in the first, that awkward atmosphere he brings doing super well to act as the moral compass to guide the ever aggressive Venom through the world. As Venom, he's hilarious, still acting like a newborn/toddler who can't take no for an answer and wants to eat everything he can for his survival. I loved the lines he delivered as Venom, I loved the joy, horror, and vulnerability he brought, and the commentary is certainly one for the books for voice acting. Harrelson still does his job well as the insane serial killer of Cletus, especially that eerie, unsettling longing that he seems to have with his darker roles. While not the most insane of a serial killer, he works well enough for the direction they took him, and they sort of corrected the hair for me so that's a win. I can't say he was my favorite villain character, so there really is not much I can say outside of a solid delivery for his backstory and that longing of something serial killer roles thrive on. Michelle Williams wins for a fun support, but again she is not utilized the best in this film and could have had more involvement on so many levels for me. The times she was on board, she was funny, a good nonverbal and verbal acting mixing to bring some of the more unique comedy moments I've seen in Marvel in some time.The Comedy:
Hands down the best part of the movie is the comedy and it is funny. Like the last installment, that dynamic relationship between Venom and Eddie is solid, a duo who play so well off of each other despite being the same voice. The aggressive personality bossing around the meeker personality goes super well, and Venom's mannerisms and taunts are a wonderful comedic tool. Then, they start using the internal monologue even better with Venom, showing that combative mindset distracting Eddie from answering normally, especially when Venom pushed enough to cause Eddie to outburst. Finally, when you see Venom get the driver seat a little bit, the writing works well with Venom exploring the universe a little more. His speeches, his jokes, and so much work with this new angle to Venom and again I was cracking up at the vaudeville humor he brought, alongside the commentary of the movie. And as I said, Michelle Williams does well in her roles, sometimes acting as a prop and other times a fantastic medium that blends all the styles together. There are a few things that Harrelson does that are funny, but they are in the backburner for me and lost to Venom's constant banter.The Mid Credits Scene:
Hands down the most exciting part, Venom's extra scene shows great promise for the series in so many ways. It's still got great comedy and chemistry you have been seeing for most of the film, but does not just act as the comedic finish Marvel likes to do. No there is some story behind it and then a nice surprise to set up the future of our dark symbiote. I won't say more to avoid spoilers, but Serkis and company get props for this one.Dislikes:
The Plot:
My friend may have liked it, but for others like me, the plot is again a rushed mess that does not utilize the characters well. The focus on the comedy allows for development of Venom and Eddie's relationship, and though not massive improvements or anything revolutionary, it works well for the buddy comedy approach. Yet, where it really went wrong involved everything else in their lives when I was watching this film. Where Anne was a key factor in the first film, became more of a side piece in this, with her plot elements opening up some comedic factor, but little else past this. The whole Eddie moving on with life and trying to adapt to the new stakes, was kind of rushed and lame, even to the point of conflict that happens in this film. The story with Cletus was... okay, and a driving factor for the decisions of how to get to Venom, but I can't say it fit with the story I had envisioned for the psychotic serial killer I know Cletus to be. And for Shriek's inclusion, held promise, but as she was not a symbiote, so she was not too ingrained into the full story. Venom's second installment does not have the same cohesiveness that other Marvel film's do and it's a shame again due to what they could have executed.Carnage feels a bit too controlled:
If I remember several comics and cartoon shows correctly, Carnage was a force that was chaotic, deadly, and insane, hence why he was able to be such a dark and threatening force. In this movie though, I don't think his utilization matched that and in fact made him a little too logical. Certainly there are moments where that primal force of hunger and death seeking are seen, but I can't say I was impressed with the other ways they took the symbiote and his host. There was no impending terror of them hunting, no close calls and horrific sequences that haunt your dreams. As for his other powers, I guess I expected more based on what the trailers showed off, but that did not happen for me. The blades were more design than used and even the projectiles were minimized, which with Carnage minimal is not way they usually go. Carnage is one of those villains whose execution requires a lot of study and detail and the direction I took only somewhat filled that craving.The Action:
Or better yet lack of it. Venom's second film is still heavily comedy based and seems afraid to embrace the action that a dark tale could really execute. Looking at the movie as a whole, there was about fifteen minutes total that we saw of this film and that's sad when comparing to so much of the other Marvel films. Most of the scuffles are one sided displays of CGI slamming that really offers no suspense or horror, so I can't say it was that exciting for me. Then the climactic ending, was kind of bland for me, again given what I've seen in the other Marvel movies. A ten minute bout of a few punches and slams that, while appropriate as a start, did not use the powers that we as fans know these monster have. Where was the dance of crimson blades a crazy, scarlet symbiote could unleash? Where was Venom's strength utilizing the environment to combat those blades and use tricks to offset the strength of Carnage? Where was Carnage's mutations evolving out and further surprising us? The answer is not on the final cut, though I did enjoy the clever use of sound bringing more of the hosts out. The final ordeal is anticlimactic for me, and did not live up to the potential that these two titans are known to bring, and could have used about 15 more minutes at least or at a few other conflicts to break it up.The VERDICT:
Venom 2 was okay with me, but it's not the best comic book based movie to come out of the woodwork. Certainly the visuals and attitude of the movie are there and the acting brings that world to life and does well with the established dynamics. It's biggest strengths for me were again the comedy and the mid credits scene, the former being the biggest selling point for fun for this film. Yet, the movie's plot is still a mess and the handling of Carnage, while not the worst, there was a lot of potential they missed out on in his use. Look wise he's great, but the Carnage I know and the Carnage I got, did not match for what I had hoped to see. In addition, the action was very limited and did not really satisfy the buildup they were trying to make. As such, the movie is okay, and fortunately has enough special effects and music to get a trip to the theater for a see. My scores for this film are:Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
30,rannynm,"Amazing CGI Graphics, Especially When Building Fall And Titans Fight",8,2 October 2021,"I like Venom: Let There Be Carnage because it is based on one of my favorite Marvel characters, Venom. I like that Carnage is a product of Venom, so watching these monsters clashing with each other is phenomenal.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is about a journalist named Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) who has a dark black, Spiderman looking devil named Venom that lives inside his body. Most of the movie shows Eddie and Venom not getting along, because Eddie is sick and tired of having Venom inside his body and Venom wants to be free to eat people. Venom is very clumsy and destructive and Eddie is frustrated because his apartment is a mess. An assassin named Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) knows Eddie and asks to speak to him before his death sentence is carried out. Eddie visits Cletus in prison, but Cletus antagonizes Eddie with his past and Venom comes out of Eddie's body to choke Cletus. Cletus bites Eddie's hand and tastes Venom's blood. So guess what happens? You have to watch the film to find out.This film has amazing CGI graphics. The graphics look so real and the buildings falling apart when Venom climbs between them look real as well. The fighting scenes between these two titans are so incredible that it makes you want to see more. I expected there to be more encounters between Venom and Carnage and was disappointed that there weren't more. The movie has a good combination of comedy and action. The music is appealing in every scene. My favorite part is, of course, the battle between Venom and Carnage in the church. Carnage is huge compared to Venom and looks more powerful than him because Carnage has multiple extremities which Venom does not have.The moral of this film is to never underestimate yourself no matter your size or strength. You do not know if you can win the war if you don't go to battle.I give Venom: Let There Be Carnage 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

It's not amazing by any means but it's enjoyable, fast paced & action packed! It has a decent runtime of 1 hour & 25 minutes, 1 hour & 30 minutes if you count the post credits scene! But yeah, the film was good with a decent story & decent characters, it was also quite funny & humourous in a couple of areas!Overall, it's a decent sequel, while not quite as good as the first film, it's definitely worth a watch & is a good watch with great graphics, epic action & decent enough story!7/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Kasady becomes Carnage, during a prison break & following a botched execution attempt. Venom has to stop Carnage's rampage, no matter the cost.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a brilliant film. Director Andy Serkis has masterfully taken over directorial duties from Venom(2018) director, Ruben Fleischer. This movie has doubled down on all the elements that made the 2018 original, entertaining. The one-liners will make you laugh raucously. It has also given us a much better villain who has more depth than Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot from the previous film. The action set pieces are superb. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. I definitely still miss the lack of a connection to Spider-Man. Tom Hardy is spectacular as Eddie Brock/Venom. Hardy's physical performance is one of the highlights of the movie. Woody Harrelson is outstanding as Cletus Kasady/Carnage. Harrelson has made the long wait for the iconic Spider-Man villain to appear on the big screen, worth it. Michelle Williams is excellent as Anne Weying. Naomie Harris is fantastic as Frances Barrison/Shriek. Reid Scott is great as Dr. Dan Lewis. Stephen Graham is good as Detective Mulligan.

35,bankofmarquis,Suffers from Sequel-itis,5,7 October 2021,"If you ever heard of the term ""Sequel-itis"" and wondered what a good example of film suffering from this malady would be, look no further than VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE.The sequel to the surprisingly well made - and well acted - 2018 VENOM that introduced audiences to the (sometimes) villain, (sometimes) anti-hero, VENOM and the human/symbiot that he has bonded to (it makes sense in the first film) - this sequel looks and feels like a quick ""money-grab"" that is keeping this character ""warm"" for bigger things (I hope) down the road.Directed by famed motion capture expert, Andy Serkis, VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE feels like a movie that was directed by a Special FX veteran for this film is long on special effects and short on what makes a film work - plot and character.And that's too bad for the 2018 VENOM film was a surprise in that while it had it's CGI moments (and plenty of them), it also had interesting plot and characters and took full advantage of two of the better actors working today - Tom Hardy and Michelle Williams.The sequel looked promising enough as both Hardy and Williams were back and Woody Harrelson was cast as the main villain (with Naomi Harris along as the villain's sidekick) so some of the ingredients were there for a quality sequel.Unfortunately, this sequel leaned heavily into the CGI-ness of the first film and made the CGI Alien Venom the focal point of the story, relegating the humans to the back. No actor was pushed further to the back than Williams who was stuck with a weak ""damsel in distress"" arc while Harrelson and Harris take turns over-acting the other making their pair of villains some of the weakest in recent comic-book movies memory.And then there is the performance of Hardy as Eddie Brock.

37,bob-the-movie-man,Chickens... but turkeys would be more appropriate.,4,16 October 2021,"I was not a great fan of the original Venom, although I did find aspects of it to like. Unfortunately, for me, the sequel - ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" - delivered even less. And I found aspects of it positively distasteful.Positives:
While most of the cast seem to be doing sequel-paint-by-numbers, I thought Naomie Harris was superb as the shrieking 'X-woman-style' villain. (I'm embarrassed to say that it took me until the end titles to realise she WAS Naomie Harris!)Some of the comedy lines between Brock and Venom made me chuckle.Negatives:
My main beef was with the script and that came down to two primary issues:-- Firstly, virtually nothing happens. It's not too much of an understatement to say that the whole plot can be summarized as a) a villain is introduced; b) the villain teams with another villain and c) Venom defeats them. It's just all so bland and linear, without any sort of discernible story arc.-- For a movie pitched more at the comedy end of the Marvel spectrum, the script is unpleasantly violent. (And, yes, before Marvel fan-boys attack me with comments, I know that this Sony/Marvel offering is NOT part of the official universe). There are numerous points at which I thought ""Ugh!"" and a nasty taste entered my mouth: the butchering of a 'Family man' prison guard, pleading for his life; the brains of a very polite young grocery store boy being senselessly smashed in; and the massacre of a priest in his own cathedral. (Actually, I have no idea what happened with the priest during the ""power-up"" scene - - a cut by the censors perhaps?) My issue is that, tonally speaking, there is a horrible mismatch between these unnecessarily violent scenes and the lighthearted and flippant nature of the rest. It's like putting a vicious gang-bang rape in the middle of ""Ant Man"".Sorry. I know he has a lot of fans, but I'm not a great fan of Tom Hardy's acting style here. ""Legend"" proved what class he could deliver. But this performance seems to be streets away from that. An acting colleague last week commented that he was looking forward to the interactions between Hardy and Harrelson. But I found both to be underwhelming.I found the visual effects for the emerged Venom to be utterly unconvincing. There were times when it looked like nothing more than a puppet on strings.I'm normally a fan of Marco Beltrami's scores. But I found the music in here to be intrusive and distracting. And that's before some (to my ears) pretty awful rap-based tracks over the closing titles.Summary Thoughts on ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"": You'll already judge from my balance of comments that this one just didn't work for me. Even as a ""park your brain at the door"" action movie, I thought it felt lazy and lacklustre. My advice? Save your money and go and watch ""The Last Duel"" instead.By the way, there is a mid-credit monkey (end-credits scene in onemannsmovies speak), worth staying for, which ties this Marvel offshoot to another sector of the Marvel catalogue. However, note that there is NO post-credits monkey!!! Like a whole bunch of us in the cinema, you'll feel pretty foolish if you sit through the interminable titles just for the film to end and the lights to come up!

38,wetmars,Tainted Love.,7,2 October 2021,"Where to start on this. Let us start with Cletus Kasady. He is widely known as a sadistic serial killer who killed his grandmother by pushing her off the stairs, threw a hairdryer on his mother's shower, tortured his pet with a drill, and did many horrific things until he was thrown into a place where he belongs. He eventually gets bullied and meets with the love of his life. I enjoyed the presence of Woody Harrelson. Although I do have problems with Carnage, I felt like this film should have been Rated-R, but you know Sony with Marvel are iffy on Rated-R Marvel films, and we rarely get them. I do feel like if this was received as Rated-R, the film would showcase the true horror of Carnage and some brutal extreme bloodbath slaughter. I am genuinely disappointed about the prison escape scene, but it was still cool. It could have been so much more. Besides the negative, the best VFX is all to Carnage and looks brilliantly stunning. The fight scenes are especially stunning and epic. I honestly thought we were never going to see Carnage in live-action. It just seemed unlikely. Frances Barrison as a character. I feel like she needed more exploration, an actual personality rather than mad love. I am a bit disappointed. I find the Carnage stuff with her quite predictable since the symbiotes don't like sound. Perhaps an 8/10 for Cletus Kasady, a better villain than Riot. Great screentime & dialogue from Cletus that makes make him menacing and seriously creepy when it comes to him being so obsessive with Eddie. ""All I've ever wanted in this world is Carnage."" I just wished both were explored more.Now, for the one and only. Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom! They are easily the best part of the film. I honestly thought that the film was going to be all comedic, but it thankfully calms down in the Second Act where Venom abandons Eddie, and we focus on Eddie's character. It does somewhat has similarities to Spider-Man 2 in my perspective. I do like the parts where Venom takes care of Eddie, instead of both of them fighting each other. ""Oh ****! Where are you going? THAT IS A RED ONE! You need to come out like right now. I will let you eat EVERYBODY! YOU PROMISE? I promise! OH YEAH!!!"" It's always nice to see their dynamic, and it never fails to entertain me. Anne Weying is always great to see. I feel bad for Dan to experience all of this. Mrs. Chen is also great.The post-credit scene is insane. The world around Eddie/Venom sitting in a hotel room on a beach randomly changes due to Multiverse madness. And we see our beloved J. K. Simmons announcing that Spider-Man's real name is Peter Parker. Venom says: ""That guy!"" then licks the screen. Could Eddie/Venom could be in No Way Home? In the trailer, we see Peter wearing a black symbiote suit where he's running in what appears to be, a lunchroom, and in the 2:27 mark, fighting Electro. Unpopular take, but I actually liked Jamie Foxx as Electro, but that will be another story soon. Well, upon a closer look, it appears to be some gold on it. I am mistaken by assuming too quickly. Oh yeah, about No Way Home. I am wary that it will once again meet the ""too many villains"" stuff. It was kinda obvious that Venom was going to encounter Tom Holland's Spider-Man because of the Sony - Marvel Spider-Man complication. Maybe we will see Eddie/Venom in the upcoming second trailer. Man, they weren't kidding that Phase 4 was going to be ""crazy"".Overall, it's a fun, messy, and entertaining film with action. I would like to see if there is an extended Director's cut on this. The animated scene of Cletus' backstory was a little nice touch with narration. The main movie had a stronger & better story. Although there were many subplots like Eddie being questioned about suspicious activities like dead bodies around the hotel where he lives, and his ""episodes"" from the previous film. Venom eventually returns to Eddie and breaks out of the room. The Police investigate the room only to find a hole. In the Third Act, we get some foreshadowing for Venom 3 as the Officer's eyes turn blue. It doesn't make sense with the dialogue where Carnage says: ""Father"" to Venom. Probably a cultural thing on their planet? The final battle was great with a lot of tensions, eventually ending where the bell falls killing Barrison. Venom saving Brock by bonding with him before the impact. Kasady reaches out his hand trying to bond with Carnage, but Venom grabs the symbiote and eats it. Eddie lets Venom decapitate Kasady. Now, I am terribly sorry if this review is all over the place. If you watch the movie, it will make sense that this review is wack.7-8/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
39,kjproulx,"Very Silly, but Fun",6,1 October 2021,"Let's start by jumping back to 2018. When Venom was about to be released, I had zero interest, and being a Spider-Man fan myself, that shocked me. I just didn't think a villain story that only exists because of Spider-Man could've worked on its own. To my surprise, while Venom wasn't a great movie by any means, I ended up having some fun with it. For that, I was certain they could improve on it with a sequel and Venom: Let There Be Carnage does just that. It's still not that good, but the novelties are cranked up to eleven and I had a blast with those elements of this film.Picking up after the first film, Cletus Kasady's (Woody Harrelson) history with Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is about to come to a head. With Kasady on death row and about to be executed, he stumbles upon a way to escape, which eventually turns him into the even more villainous Carnage. Hellbent on nothing but destruction, Carnage poses a real threat for Venom/Eddie. Other than a couple of surprises along the way, that's pretty much it for the premise. The movie wanted to pit Venom and Carnage against each other and it doesn't do anything except that. The fight and the journey to that fight is what made the movie worthwhile for me though.Tom Hardy is one of the most gifted actors out there and his quirky performance with Venom (himself) is what sells these movies. If it wasn't for his commitment to this role, these movies would be absolutely terrible. On top of that, Woody Harrelson clearly knows the type of film he's in because every moment he's on-screen is a joy to witness. He doesn't have the same relationship that Venom has with Eddie, but that's also what made it more entertaining. His character is a murderess, evil convict, but Carnage is even worse. This makes for a climax that feels earned, even though the cast is just having fun most of the time.The weakest portion of the first film for me was the fact that I didn't care about the relationship between Eddie and Anne (Michelle Williams). Her character was barely in the film, but you were meant to feel the loss Eddie had after breaking up with her. This time around, she's given a little more to do, but she also feels like she's more aware of the type of movie she's in. Even though the first movie was a little self-aware, they've now fully leaned into that. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is nothing but silliness, but it's very entertaining silliness.Overall, Venom: Let There Be Carnage probably won't win anyone over who didn't like the first, but I'll still say it's a better movie as a whole. It's a very breezy 97 minutes and it doesn't waste any time with side plots. There are quite a few weird and bizarre scenes, but it works if you're aware they're doing it on purpose. Andy Serkis as the director here took the things that worked about the first film and just did more of that, leaving the excess in the past. If you're just looking for a simple, fun time at the movies, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is purely that. There is also a major post-credits scene that says a lot about the future of Marvel. I will give this one a mild recommendation.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
40,Movi3DO,Trash,4,2 October 2021,"THAT guy....Eddy Brock and his best friend continued to save the world. Let's be straight: the first Venom movie was not good, but I still enjoyed it because of the humor. However, this movie managed to take away a lot of that comedy and created a plot that was even worse than the first one. There were so many plot conveniences that rushed the movie forward. Our main villain is just another crazy dude, nothing more than that.Of course they kept the PG-13 rating. Man Venom would be SO fun if there's gore. It pissed me off that these production companies wanted some good bucks instead of making a competent movie. The camera editing were just all over the place. I can barely comprehend what was going on. This made the action scenes messy with no fun.Even worse, the relationship between Eddy and Venom evolved in such a cringe way. Not all the humors landed, which was disappointing. Their relationship carried the first movie, but this time there's just no way.Obviously the post credit scene, which was surprising to many. However, considering how much of a joke Venom is, I'm not so optimistic about this decision.Overall, just a messy disappointment. You can basically watch the post credit scene on YouTube or something and skip this movie. 3.5/10.Go watch Titane instead, that's an actual good movie.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Carnage was awesome seeing and he looked really good and I liked the red design.I loved seeing Carnage going a murder rampage and I liked the relationship with Cletus Kasadys girlfriend Shriek, they both had the same fun when killing people.It was awesome seeing Venom and Carnage fight, also the post credits scene was satisfying and got me excited for the future (I won't spoil anything).",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

45,cardsrock,Revels in camp,6,6 October 2021,"Let There Be Carnage makes no effort to steer in a different direction from its predecessor. It fully embraces the cheesy 90s camp that many loved and derided about the first film. It can be fun, but also feels like we've advanced so much farther in the genre beyond this.This movie felt like a sprint. It's a quick 90 minutes that moves at lightning pace. Not much time is spent in the way of characterization, especially for Cletus Kasady. The Eddie and Venom bromance takes up most of the runtime, which is wise given that was the highlight of the first film.The plot is pretty generic and really only feels like it's there to set up the inevitable Venom-Carnage showdown. The fight is good, but man could this movie have really benefited from an R rating. It feels like we got a needlessly neutered version of Carnage.This movie isn't anything to write home about.

46,CANpatbuck3664,Hardy Sells Out Again but Venom 2 Only Survives Because of Sheer Campy Fun,5,11 October 2021,"Most people who liked the first Venom (me included, it was a mixed but diverting effort) were in agreement that the most enjoyable part was watching Eddie and Venom goof on each other and their banter. I'm pleased to report that they actually listened to the fans and they included much more. A lot of the dialogue is off kilter and hammy but it also delivered the only laughs I got in the movie. Tom Hardy is trying his best again, he's less of an action hero and more of a comedian in this one and while a lot of his material falls flat, some of it did land.Leading into the performances, although his effort was consistent, a lot of Hardy's performance was undercut by how goofy and poorly stitched together the rest of the movie was. He's an extremely talented actor and its cool he got a story credit but he couldn't punch his way through this. Woody Harrelson looked really bad in the marketing, it wasn't his fault though. His acting still dialed up way too high on the overdone scale but how they choose to use his character is bizarre, there's so little character motivation for his clash with Eddie Brock and his subplot with Frances is so undercooked, I just can't put that on him. Speaking of Frances, how did they get Naomi Harris for this role? She gets nothing to do, her character is poorly written and she's all over the place. I've liked her so much in other things, I just felt terrible for her. Ditto for Stephen Graham as Detective Mulligan, he's shown up in some terrible stuff before but there wasn't a chance here with how half baked his character was. Lastly, Michelle Williams is back but she's an afterthought and other than some of the random hi jinx, she's given nothing to do.The first Venom was pretty reliant on the CGI for the action, I thought it was pretty good actually but Venom 2 largely offers more of the same. I wouldn't say they're bad or even lacklustre but serviceable is accurate. Carnage is affected by the dramatic side of the movie so when he starts throwing stuff around and causing havoc, its not emotionally wrenching but it looks okay.I've listed as many positives as I can, Venom's achilles heel is the story and its handling of the characters. Small issues right? With how they handle Cletus/Carnage there's almost no conflict, its also the same with Venom and Eddie. There's no serious threat to their friendship or their partnership and while their bickering is amusing, it doesn't amount to a story. Let alone what they do with Frances and Detective Mulligan, it all amounts to a giant mess. I don't know if I've ever seen such a high budget movie that had so much work into it that was so slapdash and carelessly thrown together from a story perspective.If I were to take any kind of emotion out of it, Venom: Let There Be Carnage would be up there with Old and Wonder Woman 1984 as the biggest misfires I've seen lately. Lucky for Venom 2, there is such a things as being enjoyably bad. There a lot of campy gold here and it sustained me through the rest of the crap. So while I can't recommend seeing it in theatres, if you're into so-bad-its-good movies, this could be worth a watch. I'm not sure if I want a 3rd one though, there was a lot of potential after the original Venom, if this is the direction they chose to go, maybe its best to call it quits.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

But I also noticed that the first half hour of the movie is a bit tedious and way too talkative before the real action kicks in; that the story is wafer-thin, as well as all characters next to Tom Hardy's; and to be honest: that even Hardy's Eddy Brock doesn't leave any lasting impression.

50,statuskuo,My Brother The Alien,5,2 October 2021,"Okay, never saw the first one, so take that into account.This film meanders a lot. And towards the end, you wonder why it was ever made. Oh, right...because the first one made a kajillion dollars. Now I don't fault producer/story by/lead actor/caterer/most likely lighting technician why they chose to do a sequel, only that it is a bizarre rambling flick.The story is of a reporter (?) who is being requested by serial killer Kletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) to document his last days on Earth as he is about to be executed. When he bites the hand of Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) he obtains the blood of Venom and escapes to find...a girl who he had met in some insane asylum 25 years earlier.Well, the girl is Shriek (Naomi Harris) an X-Men like ""freak"" who builds a romance while being incarcerated. To a point where they are bound to find each other as the tale unfolds. Does it matter? Meh.There are a few logical questions here...A) were they children when he met and now spend time in a mental institution together? In which case, how is it he is able to commit serial killing while released? Maybe I missed something there.Also, B) though Kletus is told she'd been killed by a cop during her transfer to an underground research facility, what was the point of just telling him she was alive? What purpose does that serve? Yeah, not that lame of a loose end. But still nagged me.Well, most of the story is of the relationship between Venom and Eddie. They are the oddest couple you can imagine. They bicker like an old married couple and also attempt to cheer on another up when need be. None of this translates to actual fun...but director Andy Serkis still attempts to shoehorn your typical Marvel movie glib jokes in. Ugh. It gets very monotonous and creepy. I mean...they share a body.All chaos breaks loose as Kletus and Shriek wreck havoc to find the people who kept them apart. None of which explains why Red Venom has so much hate for Venom. And you do get to see Harrelson's return to Micky (from ""Natural Born Killers"") joyful brutality. It's not as fun as it sounds.Perhaps what hurts the most is that, it really goes a long way to convince you why this movie needed to be made. No real reason I can think of to continue the story. Hardy is decent. Though his Aussi accent peeks through a lot. Surprised that a movie this caliber dropped the ball on it. But this isn't meant to be much more than a stopping point for, maybe, another installment. Surprisingly bland.It may have done better if they'd went full ""R"" instead of a ""PG-13""",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

53,danielmanson,So much carnage,7,25 October 2021,"I knew midway through watching this film that it was going to be very polarising with the audience. It's a plot that definitely divides, the comedy might not be to your taste, the characters might not be for you and the plot might be either too tame or too extreme. Below is my personal thoughts, bare in mind it's from the view of someone that enjoys marvel films and watches a lot of them, but not keen enough to give a toss about the marvel universe. (Skip to final para if you can't be arsed with the in depth).The Comedy: I personally found the comedy element to work really well. I sniggered a good few times and I don't think it was overdone and used in a way that didn't affect the plot.The plot: the plot I found ok. It focused a little too much on the character arcs of Eddie and Venom, it wasn't offputting or anything drastic, but I feel like we could have got more from it. Seemed to lack that ""wow"" factor. But overall it's definitely watchable and not overly confusing or challenging. You can sit back and relax and just simply watch with ease.Special mention to Woody Harrelson who I thought did a really good job. The character Frances I found really jarring and I just could not get into it. I can't overly pinpoint why, but from the get go she was dead annoying and couldn't be bothered whenever she was on screen.The CGI overall was done really well on the whole. Maybe a couple of minor dodgy moments, but when you have a film so heavily reliant on CGI then it's bound to happen. But overall I was impressed.Overall, the reason I think people will be very polarised on this, is because the plot just isn't very meaningful. It's a lot of carnage and nothing else too much on value. I personally liked that as I could sit back and just zone out almost and watch a fun film. The films comedic elements will also be a little opposing as peoples sense of humour will always be different. But it's harmless jokes and fun.If you like your heroes to have humour, like a lot of action and enjoy Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson then it's 100% worth a watch and you will enjoy. 7/10 from me.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

55,Xavier_Stone,Not a good sequel,2,6 October 2021,2 stars for Tom Hardy trying to support this entire film. I liked the first Venom but this is nothing but filler. Woody gives it a decent shot but it's way off the mark and the plot is straightforward and expected.There are tons of ways to script a sequel to a popular movie.

56,sweidman-28016,Not Quite There,6,10 October 2021,"""All I ever wanted in this circus of hell is carnage.""In Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Eddie Brock attempts to reignite his career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady, who becomes the host of the symbiote Carnage and escapes prison after a failed execution. The first Venom did not do it for me as well as many others. It split audiences into those who really liked it and those who hated it. It felt like there was no middle ground. But with the change in directors and the thought of Carnage being part of this story, it did bring me to want to go out and see it. And though this may have got somewhere that the first didn't, it didn't get to where I would've liked to have seen it go. Here, it embraces campiness and doesn't take itself as seriously as the first. I feel like they were trying to make up for last time. As campy as it tried to be, I don't think it quite understood how to utilize it. For me, the beginning and end embraced it the most. When it did, I found myself sort of enjoying it. We saw this with Malignant last month, but this is another movie that feels like it could've been some b-movie found in the back of a video store. Had it not tried to force itself to be comedic and take some things as serious as it did, maybe it could've gotten to that level. Mainly, it's the story that disappoints. There's so much to unpack and they do so in around 90 minutes. I love the runtime, but it moves by so fast there is literally no room to breathe. There's hardly a quiet moment. After some time I just wanted a break.Somewhere within the second act, the movie kind of loses what it's trying to be. The story becomes messy and can't decide where to go. Most of the comedy takes place in here and some of it does land. This whole section is like a side plot that could've worked elsewhere. Tom Hardy pulls this movie together. You know that he loves being Eddie and Venom and wants to make the most of it. Woody Harrelson is a good addition to the franchise, but I don't think his character was nearly fleshed out as he could've been. Carnage has some big shoes to fill, and though the movie doesn't do him justice, the fight scenes are great. The action is a lot of fun, though it can be too much. Everything turns to CGI, but much like Godzilla Vs. Kong, we're in it for the action scenes. I will note the production design, especially in the last act looks great. They had the right atmosphere going to match this haunted looking church. Maybe it's just me, but it put me in the spirit for Halloween. Overall, this didn't live up to the hype. It felt more like a filler movie within the franchise, besides the great after credit scene. I was entertained and everyone in the theater was too. But if you're looking at the story, it's rushed, messy, and not all that great. Andy Serkis had the right idea and so did most apart of it, but they couldn't quite get to where they wanted to be.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
57,ethanbresnett,Not the worst thing I've ever seen...,5,24 October 2021,"The dialogue... lord help me the dialogue. It was utterly dreadful. I don't think a single sentence came out of character's mouth that was good. It was a script of cliché, bad humour, awful plot points, bland characters. So disappointing.I never really rated the CG in the first film, I think the Venom character looked cool but didn't quite fit too well with live action. When you add in Carnage as well it was all a bit too CG heavy.The plot was meh. I can see what they were trying to do and it wasn't bad, but was instantly forgettable. Woody Harrelson (who is a terrific actor) was quite bad in this and his villain was a bit tired and bland.In terms of action it was a bit thin on the ground and the final big fight scene was fine I guess. Again not bad but instantly forgettable.What more can I say really. The character of Venom is so cool and there is so much potential, but they are just not getting these films right at all.5/10 as it was just about entertaining enough, and if nothing else it was blissfully short.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

director: Andy Serkis
starring: Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Williams, Naomie Harris, Reid Scott, Stephan Graham, Peggy Lu etcoverall rating 46/100Eddie Brock attempts to reignite his career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady, who becomes the host of the symbiote Carnage and escapes prison after a failed execution. What an absolute mess this was.Let's be nice and start with some positives as there was some. The character background and set up was solid. As well as great cinematography and humour. As well as the performances and chemistry the characters. I thought the background and set up involving Carnage (Woody Harrelson) and Shriek (Naomie Harris) despite being rushed was solid. It established clear motivations for carnage and set out a clear darker tone, whilst also serving as a good introduction to how unstable Cletus is as a character. I also thought the cinematography was strong for this film. Considering the film had essentially the same budget as the first film they paid a lot more attention to detail. The film was visually stunning, and visually creative with the great character designs especially for carnage. I also thought the humour for the most part landed well. The film had witty, fast paced jokes that kept you laughing a lot of the time. The film embraced its campiness with its characters and the humour, and I enjoyed it. This was largely helped by the fantastic on-screen chemistry between Eddie and Venom. They are just infectious and hilarious to watch as there back and forth interactions were always a highlight to watch. Plus, the performances from Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris were fun. They delivered passionate and campy performances and just looked like they were enjoying playing the characters.However, my first few negatives would be the terrible pacing. Lack of character depth or development. The poor script and over reliance on comedy. The film was all over the place in terms of pacing. It needed to be at least 20 minutes longer. Coming in at 97 minutes the film moved at such a frantic and messy pace, it never allowed anything to breathe or leave any room for any form of development. It felt like lazy writing as there was so many plot holes and it felt like the writers were cutting corners just for the sake of it. Because of this there was a complete lack or character depth. It was one dimensional and lazy. And any attempt at development or depth just felt like copy and paste from the first film and it bought nothing new to the table. The script itself for me just felt lazy, poorly structured and the humour especially became tedious. It became so over-relied on that it just got annoying after a while. The script fell into countless genre tropes that it didn't even try to escape from.My final few positives would be the action, strong horror elements. The fun villain and great end credit scene. I thought the action scenes that we did get were great. They were entertaining, thrilling and had great horror elements to them particularly with Carnages powers, I wish they had used more horror. As the moments of horror we did get were so strong with carnage. I thought Carnage as a villain was strong. The film found a good balance of campy and over the top, but also making Cletus very unstable. He was undoubtedly fun to watch whenever he was on screen and Woody Harrelson did a great job. And of course the end credit scene was great, setting up a lot of future implications for Venom as a character and it was an exciting set up.My final few negatives would be the underused elements. The lack of connection with venom and carnage in the plot. As well as generic elements and a messy final act. The film lacked any form of focus or development of one particularly thing. The characters were underdeveloped. The use of horror which would have been so strong for a character like Carnage felt wasted. And the characters were underused especially Anne (Michelle Williams) she could have been used so much more and given some depth to Eddie, but it just felt repetitive. The film was also generic and fell into so many genre tropes in the final act. They made Anne a damsel in distress and an innocent needing to be saved. It was lazy, very poor in terms of representation and it really frustrated me. The final act despite its entertaining moments was a mess with the complete lack of motivation for Carnage to go against Venom there was a complete lack of anything really connecting either character to each other. Cletus's goal was to reunite with Shriek, and it felt like that was it, so it was a waste of his character and the end credit scene only proved that.Overall, Venom: Let there be carnage is for the most part entertaining. And boasts strong visuals, committed performances and the chemistry between Eddie and Venom is undeniably charming. But this film was lazy, rushed and frankly a complete mess. And tried to do too many things at once, therefore it lost itself.Overall rating 46/100.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

63,flicklover,Ho-hum sequel.,5,3 October 2021,"I wasn't a huge fan of the first Venom film tgat came out in 2018 but it was very funny mostly due to Tom Hardy's frantically comic performance as Eddie Brock/Venom. It was what was. A rated R comic book film with a more black comedic edge. Not bad, but not terribly memorable. Now with Venom: Let There Be Carnage we get more of the same only this ti e the film goes for pure camp. It has virtually no story. The villain, Cleatus Kasaday which turns into Carnage is played with over the top glee by Woody Harrelson. He is a serial killer on death row that wants to give Eddie an exclusive interview and reveal certain facts about his murders. He bites Eddie at one point thus ingesting a small part of Venom so he becomes a red symbiote. Carnage. More or less we know the rest. Most of the film which us pretty short at about 90 minutes spends most of its running time with Eddue and Venom's back and forth banter that was also present in the first film. It's funny at times but becomes repetitive. Michelle Williams is back as Anne, Eddie's ex fuance who shows up to tell Eddie she is engaged. All of this comes to a head once Carnage shows up. Venom separates from. Eddie after an argument and tries to join with other humans but they all die. Eventually these two rejoin to fight Carnage. It's all done with the typical CGI pyrotechnics and it us entertaining but the film is so jokey and light that you don't really care about what's happening on screen. Woody Harrelson is funny but not really menacing as Cletus. So really no sense of danger or stakes to be memorable. The first film was better in that at least there was some semblance of plot and stakes for the characters.Uninspired sequel.Grade: C.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
64,jakethesnake-42007,Meh at best,5,2 October 2021,Mediocre at best is what I can say about this film. There is so much going on and the story is to fast for any character development.

There's moments yes but it's not enough to make it a good film.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
65,ayoreinf,Understanding the nature of the beast,8,1 November 2021,"Sometimes I wonder if I saw the same movie other reviewers write about. So many here say it had no plot or if it did have any, it was a mess none could make any sense of. Well the movie I saw had a very straightforward plot which I followed without any difficulty and the people watching it with me didn't seem to complain. Yes I do agree, the acting was top notch. I will mention Tom Hardy who does superbly as Eddie Brock, and seems to be the voice of Venom too, which is one of the best voice acting I've seen (or heard) in a very long time. Another one that deserves mentioning is Woody Harrelson who seems to enjoy playing psychotic killers and gives a stellar performance as the tormented but utterly deranged Cletus Kasady. All the others are very good too or at least very professional. The movie follows the first installment's most important aspect (in my personal book) that is the savage nature of Venom is here straight from the comics books just as he was originally conceived and for me, that deserves special appreciation. The writers and creators of this movie, like those who started the franchise do understand the nature of the beast - the entire thing wouldn't be worthy of our time without this understanding.Regarding the sense of humor demonstrated throughout the movie - it's always very dark and wry humor, never a LOL but rather some wry smiles or maybe a chuckle here and there. I don't think LOL comedy would suit this movie, while the wry dark humor suits it to perfection.Bottom line - that's Venom - violent, savage, dark and maybe a bit chaotic, but not in a way that makes it impossible to follow and understand. That's the nature of the beast, as I said already - the entire movie makes sense only this way and I like it if only for the fact it dares going through with this bizarre type of hero all the way.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
66,dommercaldi,Venom: Let There Be Crap,3,16 October 2021,"Pros:
1. The CGI looks good which helps to prevent Carnage (Woody Harrelson) and Venom (Tom Hardy) from becoming too cartoonish.2. Both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson provide as good as a performance as they can.3. There is fantastic chemistry between Woody Harrelson and Tom Hardy, which makes it a shame that there aren't more scenes with them two in.Cons:
1. The pacing is horribly rushed, as story-lines and conflicts are introduced and then resolved almost instantly.2. The character conflicts are exceedingly flimsy and thus uninteresting, for example that between Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) wherein they fall out of an engagement (which lasts about a minute), but in the next scene they have together they're friends again.3. The writing is incredibly lazy and it's clear that not much thought went into it. An example of this would be when Venom and Eddie Brock rally to defeat Carnage and Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) by uttering the cliche that they're stronger together than apart (even though their fallout was violent and Eddie Brock forces Venom to fundamentally change his diet, whilst claiming that Carnage and Cletus Kasady aren't symbiotic even though the inverse is true for them.4. There are too many forced conflicts which take screen-time away from the more interesting conflicts and story-lines.5. The comedy is hit and miss, but mostly miss as it felt that it was largely for immature audiences.6. Considering that this movie was about Venom and Carnage (two ravenous man-eaters), in addition to a prolific serial killer featuring and child abuse being brought up, this movie should have aimed for an R-rating but instead it played it safe and thus was more boring than it should have been.7. The movie was a little tonally all over-the-place as it kept introducing humour into the serious moments which cheapened said serious moments immensely.8. Despite there being few relevant characters to the story, most of them are still given barely anything to do.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
67,movieman6-413-929510,"Comedic action scenes in the second Venom movie, but unfortunately a lesser script.",6,22 October 2021,"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is the sequel to Venom. The film is directed by Andy Serkis, the director of Breath and Mowgli.In the film, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) still lives in the same body with symbiote Venom. Eddie tries to revive his journalism career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) in order to find more clues about the murders he is suspected of. When Kasady attacks him, he also gets a symbiote called Carnage and knows break out of jail and cause mayhem, Eddie and Venom must now make up their differences and stop Carnage.After the first Venom movie, this sequel is making a movie that fans have been waiting for, as they now use the character Carnage. Director Andy Serkis has experience in conveying characters with multiple personalities in the same body, having become famous for playing the character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings film series.Because of his position as a director, he helps to properly transfer the effects in the film. Because he has looked at most scenes with an eye for detail, the symbiote scenes also come across more believable in this film compared to the first film. He knows how to provide entertaining action scenes. He also helps Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson play their dual roles in the film.The weakest point of the film is unfortunately the story, because that was largely conceived and written by Kelly Marcel alone. In other films she has worked with others on the film scripts and has independently written the screenplay for Fifty Shades of Grey.This is reflected in this film. Fortunately, the comic moments come across well, because she got help from Tom Hardy here. The romantic scenes that play a major role in the film appear weaker, so that the viewer doesn't really care about the romantic scenes. The ending is also a bit rushed. Tom Hardy comes across well and believable again in the dual role of Eddie Brock and Venom. The two characters come across as a couple stuck together in the same body and trying to make the best of it even though they don't always agree. Woody Harrelson has been seen by fans as the perfect casting for the role of Cletus Kasady and Carnage since acting in the movie Natural Born Killers. He manages to portray the role in the film in an appropriate and comical way, but he is a bit counteracted by the lesser script. Michelle Williams and Naomie Harris play their roles well in the film, but if they had been given less time in the film, the lead roles would have had more time. This could have made the movie a little better.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

69,dasa108,It made me miss Sam Raimi's Venom,3,14 October 2021,"Let's do some history. For a hero or anti-hero to have a decent story at least there has to be a story, a motivation, and also a worthwhile villain. In this case they managed to destroy Spiderman's most important villain (Carnage) by including him in a story where the producers, screenwriters and director did not know what to do. The big mistakes: repeat villain; the villain of the first Venom and the one in this film are almost the same. Cletus Kassidy's lover does not use the name Shriek (her character's name) and does not even use all the powers that correspond to her according to the canon. Woody Harrelson's look varies between Venom 1 to Venom 2 which marks a disaster in the aesthetic continuity of the character. Venom's character becomes increasingly unbearable and doesn't generate any sympathy at all. So much so that one begins to miss the Raimi version of this character. Considering the derivation of the character, it is absolutely correct to affirm that Venom will never be able to star in a decent movie since the scripts are by rule horrible, the direction lackluster, the production is not ambitious and the attachment to respect the legacy of the character is non-existent.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

72,darkreignn,Works best when it's trying to be a comedy,6,3 October 2021,"As ironic and unexpected as it may be, ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" works best when it's attempting to be a comedy. To be quite honest, I found this film funnier than any mainstream comedic film that's been released in the past couple of years; one scene in particular in which Venom was attempting to make Eddie Brock cry had me rolling in my seat, practically crying of laughter myself. Make no mistake, this sequel takes the camp and goofiness of the original and amplifies to a degree so absurd that if you find yourself unable to adapt, you'll certainly despise this film.However, I enjoyed the silliness of the first act - it was genuinely funny, filled with slapstick comedy and great chemistry between Venom and Eddie. And if you enjoy this type of comedy, you'll probably enjoy this movie as well. However, if you came into this film to see action, and I'm assuming most people will have that same desire when they're buying a ticket to this movie, then you'll be very disappointed.There is barely any action in this film, and when there is, it's as watered down as my father's whiskey on the rocks after leaving it to sit on the table for two hours. You may have heard director Andy Serkis say that this film ""pushes the PG-13 rating to its very limits,"" and that's a bigger joke than any gags present in this movie. The violence is so bland that it's practically directionless; everyone's favorite Spider-Man villain, Carnage, is about as threatening as a Build-a-Bear plushie. Sure, you see him cause a little havoc, but it's nothing too graphic, or disturbing, or menacing, especially when compared to ""The Dark Knight,"" a superhero movie that actually did push the PG-13 rating to its limit.So, if you're not getting good action, what are you getting? A good time. Like I said, this movie is so silly that I found it practically impossible not to have a grin on my face for the majority of its run time. And even though I did find myself disappointed with the lack of grit, I was entertained enough to look past that and roll with the punches.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

75,TheVictoriousV,"Sometimes fun-bad, but often boring-bad",4,6 October 2021,"Sequels, sequels, and more sequels! Who's getting a sequel this time? Why, it's the evil counterpart to Spider-Man (or at least an alien who based its appearance on him after fusing with his mind) who, in this new canon, exists on his own and is a good guy - or as much of a good guy as one can be when one is a flesh-eating Symbiote from the distant stars. Now, he's up against an even worse and eviller version.While the original Venom was pretty unambiguously a bad movie, I'm positively shocked that some people hated it as much as they did. It was a stupid film, but it kinda owned it and wasn't trying to be an epic spectacle (mostly).Tonally, it was a bit clunky, but Venom 2 is more intelligibly a black comedy, at least when we're in the presence of lowlife Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and the Venom parasite that lives with/inside/through him. When the monstrous Carnage, another Symbiote, enters the picture, it gets more violent. PG-13 violent.Alas, I didn't think Carnage was anything to cheer for. I'm not a puritan when it comes to comic-book accuracy, but here it actually would've improved the movie, had they followed the Marvel source material. The idea with Cleetus Kasidy (played here by Woody Harrelson) is that he is so insane and far removed from mankind that he fully becomes one with his Symbiote - more so than Peter Parker or even Eddie Brock did.This might've provided an interesting contrast to Venom; Brock and the Symbiote are like a bickering couple at the start of this movie (which, in a fashion I've come to expect from these movies, is both bizarre and hilarious) and still have trouble co-existing. The day is saved when they learn to work as one, whereas Kasidy eventually fails to keep Carnage in check - his tragedy isn't that he loses himself, or his idenitity, to the dark parasite. No big deal is made out of Carnage technically being Venom's ""offspring"" either.And yes, the climax of the film, once again, is no more creative than CGI globs of sh-t pummelling each other. One could get some truly disturbing imagery and psychological themes out of a climax involving the Symbiotes; instead it's another superhero wrestling match where a tall building of some kind takes the worst punches. Let There Be Carnage is better than Venom, but certainly not by a lot.We all know this isn't the end, and that many of the other slightly-lesser-known Spider-Man villains are getting films of their own within this new Venom universe, including Morbius the Living Vampire and Kraven the Hunter - anyone that Sony still hasn't handed to Disney, basically. I'm not terribly excited.Then again, there is a post-credit scene that suggests otherwise; that the Venom films, thanks to the Multiverse Saga, may yet get to cross over into the more lucrative Disney-Marvel franchise.We know the barriers between the Spider-Man film universes are about to be utterly shattered by Spider-Man: Far From Home (the show WandaVision also teased something similar), so it may not sound surprising. But the post-credit scene really does seem like something that was slapped on at the last moment to make the comic-book nerds curious. Remember when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had a post-credit sequence that was literally just a scene from that year's X-Men movie? With a Marvel Multiverse Saga coming up, maybe there's more of a connection between TASM and the X-Men series than we gave these films (and their after-the-movie stingers) credit for? Electro vs. Mystique, anyone?",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

When this movie is bad for me then it's really time to think well. It neither amused me nor made me laugh. The script is very bad because there is a lot of illogicality, and little has been explained that has confused me. They were in a hurry in the movie a couple of times and I felt it. Questionnaires popped up over my head during the film. The characters are very poorly presented so I didn't care. The expected orgy of CGI effects is expected.

Which is both the movie's strength and its weakness.Best of the movie is the post credit scene which contain a stunning revelation and will just blow you mind.

After 10 or 15 minutes of jokes that Venom provides it starts to get so dull and pointless that will make everyone think WHY!? It just never stops, constant poking in the ears by jokes are annoying as Venom is annoying Eddie.There are some powers to the story but it feels so rushed and too much time devoted to things that aren't important. Each fight scene could use a minute or two more and some actual violence instead of throwing people around. Brain hungry Carnage is only eating when allowed by writers and it's dull to point of realization that Carnage might actually be just Red symbiote that actually loves humans.The greatest thing about whole movie is post-credit scene that is minute long and gives us glimpse into what might come to be.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
79,Lewis_Heather787,Surprisingly funny !!!,6,23 October 2021,"I was surprised at how much I ended up enjoying ""Venom"" from 2018 and the same could be said about this film as well. Not the greatest piece of cinema in the world, it was never trying to be genre defining or anything like that, just a damn good time. This is just a really good, fun, exciting time at the cinema.....shove a huge handful of popcorn in your mouth and enjoy the ride!!I will admit I was a little hesitant about a sequel to ""Venom"", it could go either one of two ways. One, be a warranted sequel that expands the story/world or Two, just be a cash cow!! Thankfully in this case ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is most definitely the first scenario..........well ok maybe a little bit of both haha.Tom Hardy (Eddie) and the relationship he has with Venom is once again the main attraction of the film. It is written so so well, fantastic comedic elements that actually have you laughing aloud. (Which sadly even some comedies actually struggle to do). Picks up right from where we left off with them having banter and arguments together is simply brilliant !!I'd also mention that Michelle Williams and Tom Hardy have a great chemistry on screen. Their story in the first film felt so believable because of this and once again they thrive of one another performances.Directing, action, story and CGI are all on a good level and actually feel as if the people behind it really cared about the product.Sadly though there are a couple of parts that don't work that well for me personally. Firstly Woody Harrelson, just doesn't really suit this film to me. I love the guy I think he is a terrific actor but I'm not sure he was cast correctly in this. His performance isn't awful or distracting, its just I feel someone else could have fitted it better. That also goes for Naomie Harris, it just doesn't seem to fit to me. Again she wasn't awful or bad, I just didn't think she was best suited to this. Neither of these complaints are really really negative, just a bit of a nitpick.Overall this film did exactly what I wanted it to do. Don't trash all the good work that was set up in the first film and actually try and expand the story/world of the film. 65% out of 100 its a average/good film just like the first one. Its perfectly fine and does its job, nothing sensational about it but then again it didn't need to be!!!!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

I absolutely loved getting to see more of Venom and Eddie's relationship. They had good character development as they lead to live with each other and I think Michelle Williams as Anne was good too. She has some fun with the role. However for a film that is titled ""Let there be Carnage"", I think it needed more. There's only boss battle between Venom and Carnage and it comes out right at the end of the movie. And despite being touted as an impossible fight to win, Venom easily defeats him. Which isn't a surprise, you are watching a Venom film after all. You know the hero wins. But it just didn't help to make Carnage look like a real threat. And I also think the film needed more backstory on Cletus and Shriek's relationship. It didn't do much to make care enough about them. But I think if you are a fan of Venom there will be lots to still like and have fun with. After all Venom and Eddie are clearly the best part of the movie.

A marginal improvement over its predecessor and for one reason: Woody Harrelson. This man steals the show. I could tell he was having a ball with this role. He's a total carefree nutbar and when Carnage goes berserk, it's a wild ride; fast-paced and chaotic thrills ensue. He's vastly more entertaining than the first film's villain and you'll almost be rooting for him. With that said, the tonal inconsistencies are still very much present in this sequel and I'm sure Marvel diehards will once again be upset with the lack of grounded depth surrounding Eddie Brock and Venom. I'm still sort of reeling from that unfulfilled feeling the first film left me so I can definitely sympathize.This is a buddy film, through and through; cheesy banter and cliched writing all around but I wouldn't consider it painful. It got a laugh out of me here and there, I won't lie. Have I seen this kind of story before? Numerous times. Are the things Eddie and Venom say to each other beyond stupid? No doubt. However, like its predecessor - that I recently warmed up to a little bit - you just have to take the corniness or leave it because you'll either have a lot of fun or be begging for Venom to bite your head off. Also, it's SHORT. Halle-freakin'-lujah. Not every film needs to be 2 hours long, even superhero ones. Overall, if you're bored and just want to shut your brain off to some silly monster thrills, you have your flick.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
83,SPZMaxinema,STAY FOR THE MID CREDIT SCENE!,8,3 October 2021,"I will not give anything away but oh man, that mid credit scene...and in general the movie wasn't bad! I thought Carnage and the scenes with him were pretty cool and Woody Harrelson and Tom Hardy did well as always. Aside from a few parts and moments sprinkled throughout the film that were ridiculous and didn't make sense, it was pretty entertaining!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
84,jdring2007,"loud and violent, Carnage owns the screen but Venom is still a blast; Hardy and Harrelson have great standalone chemistry; just wish was R",8,4 October 2021,"I enjoyed the first but was disappointed with the villain and characters outside of Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock. As a big Carnage fan since I was a kid, this didn't disappoint. Every scene of Harrelson turning into Carnage gave me major The Thing vibes and never got old. I only wish there was more on-screen violence and gore, which was due to the PG-13 rating, something I didn't even know until after the movie. While a big disappointment there, it nonetheless didn't keep me from enjoying it. Harrelson was especially entertaining as Cletus Kasady, and Stephen Graham was a nice addition. The humor throughout never felt forced or cheesy, unlike parts of the first. The post-credits scene gives me new hope for the future of Venom, but sadly I won't hold my breath for another R-rated installment.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
85,hunter-friesen,Venom 2: A Carnage of Quality,3,4 October 2021,"""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is an insult. It's an insult to the pieces of paper that were mutilated to make the script. It's an insult to the film stock. It's an insult to the millions of dollars that could have served an infinitely better purpose. It's an insult to activists, as it waves gay pride around with an ultra-corporate attitude. It's an insult to the talents of Michelle Williams, Naomie Harris, and Robert Richardson. But most importantly, it was an insult to my time, as it took much more from me than merely ninety minutes.The first ""Venom"" was bad for its reasons, as it was tonally inconsistent, with Tom Hardy and director Ruben Fleischer having conflicting ideas on what the movie should be. In the end, Fleischer's darker take overpowered Hardy's goofiness. Throw in weak characters and plot, and you got yourself one of the worst movies of 2018.""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" has addressed one of those problems, as it swings the tonal pendulum entirely in the other direction, resulting in self-parody.The sequel picks up where the last film left off, with Eddie and the alien symbiote, Venom, learning to live together within the same body. The two of them seem to be ripped from a Capra screwball comedy, as they're sparring in slapstick fashion.Marking his return since the post-credit scene in the 2018 original, the deranged serial killer, Cletus Kasady, is about to be put on death row. But before that fateful day arrives, Cletus and Eddie's paths cross, resulting in the birth of Carnage, the T-1000 to Venom's T-800. Cletus and Carnage spark their symbiotic relationship, one that seeks the doom of Eddie, and the rescue of Cletus's longtime flame, Shriek.Replacing Fleischer, who was busy with ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" and currently working on ""Uncharted,"" is motion-capture wizard, Andy Serkis. It's a fitting lateral move, considering he's worked with visionary directors such as Peter Jackson (as Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and Matt Reeves (as Caesar in the ""Planet of the Apes"" trilogy), two people able to seamlessly blend visual creations within reality.Serkis hasn't fancied himself much as a director, with ""Breathe"" and ""Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle"" being so underseen that they may as well not exist. With ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" Serkis has landed on strike three, hopefully landing him in director jail.There's an erratic and jerky quality to film, one that tries to reflect the inner torment between Eddie and Venom. Locations become interchangeable, and so does logic as character motivations become lost in the struggle. Much of the actors seem lost as well, with Michelle Williams (way too talented to stoop this low for a paycheck) constantly trying to find a reason to exist beyond just being the contractually obligated ""love interest that got away.""Things quickly become hard to follow, with Venom acting as Eddie's inner monologue, butting in at every possible moment with one cringe-inducing line after another. Integral information is doused while three characters speak at the same time, making the effort needed to keep things straight not worth it. Once Venom and Eddie split up their bromance, you're relieved as it means a few moments of peace and quiet.There also seems to be an inevitable ugliness to the ""Venom"" films, as Matthew Libatique turned in the worst work of his career in 2018, and now the legendary Robert Richardson (a frequent collaborator with Quentin Tarantino, Oliver Stone, and Martin Scorsese) produces his most drab and cheap-looking work. At some point, you have to wonder how many people are involved in this franchise just for the money.Definitely not here for the cash is Tom Hardy, who has deepened his involvement by receiving the first writing credit of his career. Hardy has always delivered 110% for each of his roles, even if it wasn't in the best interest of the film. With this sequel, Hardy, as well as Harrelson, have dialed things up to a ""Looney Tunes"" level of zany. There's at least some unintentional comedy in their line readings, with a highlight being ""I'm a real boy and you're just an amoeba!""The badness of ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" made me appreciate other comic-book films even more. Marvel may be getting stale with their formula, but at least it works on a fundamental level. And based on the post-credit scene, we'll have to see which side of the coin wins out, a battle which I am not looking forward to.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
86,rdamian1963,Entertaining but repetitive,6,26 October 2021,"The Venom sequel has a few good things going for it, but it still manages to fall short. The acting is solid throughout
Special effects are outstanding, and the movie is just fun. Where it falls short - with so much action and violence, it lacks the appropriate visuals. The action sequences, although visually stunning, are rather repetitive.. its not a great movie but its enjoyable enough. Grab some popcorn and give it a watch.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
87,daniellawson-14-787057,Much better than the first film,7,16 October 2021,"POSITIVES:1) The film definitely adds a lot more humour than the first one, which I think worked well
2) It feels so unusual now to see a film that is only 90 minutes long, but I think the film benefits from having a really focused and streamlined script
3) The direction, particularly the action scenes, were much better than the first film
4) The special effects were so much better than the first film
5) The post credits scene was really greatNEGATIVES:1) I was never able to understand how Cletus was able to become Carnage just by biting Eddie and tasting his blood? Or how doing that would create a symbiote so much stronger than Venom?2) The film definitely rushes through a lot of the exposition - for example Cletus' origin is explained through a little post card that he writes for Eddie
3) Bringing back Anne and Dan from the first film was a nice touch, but did feel largely unnecessary as they don't really have any purpose in the film and it's a bit unbelievable that Anne and Eddie would still be friends when Anne is now with Dan.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
88,lotekguy-1,Not up to expectations set by the first Venom,3,30 September 2021,"As I write this, 11 of 17 reviewers awarded 8+ stars, mostly declaring10s. Oh, how I wish I'd seen the same movie they did. I liked the first installment enough for a 7 that flirted with 8. Its mix of humor and action made my intro to these players quite enjoyable, creating eagerness for this one.What I got was a huge serving of sequel dropoff. The Felix and Oscar feuding between host and symbiote seemed forced and grew more tiresome than amusing. The CGI action sequences were severely deflated by bad cuts and worse lighting, diminishing one's ability to identify who was doing what to whom. If a film is meant to thrive on carnage enough to make it eponymous, then SHOW IT IN VIVID DETAIL! We could have seen a lot more of it without blowing the PG-13the producers apparently coveted.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
89,isaacochoterena,Entertaining but with several flaws,5,14 October 2021,"Compared to the first, this movie created a void for me.The human villain of this sequel is not well developed and feels a bit too much, on Carnage's part, he is by far the best of the movie, the scenes of him are incredible. The special effects are very good, the sound in a movie theater is impressive, some performances are decent. On the other hand we have a poorly done editing, some script holes, the interpretation of Woody Harrelson does not seem good to me, the excess of the use of comedy is a bit tedious and the sentimentalities are a little above adequate.I liked the film, especially for Carnage and his very imposing scenes, but it did not develop the human villain from the beginning as the first film did, I did not like some conveniences that the script used, I definitely think its better the first, but this one does not seem bad to me, especially since the experience of seeing it in the cinema is unique.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
90,MoistMovies,Weird.. this should be R,5,12 October 2021,"The writing is very stiff and predictable..
The source material is being sqeezed to being a empty shell on film.. also possibly Tom hardys worst acting in this one.. compared to his acting in something like the series 'taboo' for example... he clearly is doing these films for fat pay checks. Good on him. Gives him room for passion projects.If deadpool can be R... why not venom? It needs a R rating even more. But instead makes Eddie this pleading sad sack that wants no violence... lethal protector.. what a joke. I can even recall a single death that had any blood.. in a venom film......

The Tone Should be like The Punisher Movie.Instead we get a futile attempt at humour and some Choppy Action.Venom 2018 had a somewhat Dark tone Here and There to it but it needed the violence and less joking about, as a result Venom 2018 was Lacklustre because it felt like it had to cut corners.Venom Let There Be Carnage Is Crap.There Are 3 Scenes that I Liked, The Prison Breakout Scene was Great to see, Cletus Kasady's Animation Backstory was Nicely done and The Ending Fight when Carnage turns huge but even in that scene you barely get to see the Scale of it.Everything is too choppy.The Movie Is Crap.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

With that said however it's fun to watch multiple high caliber actors just ham it up and have fun in these roles. If you were a fan of the first one, you'll likely enjoy this film.

94,theredsky,Venom: Let There Be Carnage Review,4,21 October 2021,"A film that doesn't take itself too seriously but still falls into the same traps as the first film. In regards to the first film, this is definitely better. The first one took itself way too seriously and was very poorly lite. This film definitely becomes much much goofier after the opening scene and has more of a sense of personality to it than the other film. There isn't a lot of personality as it becomes very formulaic. All of the acting is pretty bad but in a fun kind of way. Tom Hardy is definitely having a lot of fun and gives the best performance but Woody Harrelson and Naoime Harris are so bad that they are funny. Their chemistry is nonexistent and even leads to some logical issues in the final battle with Harris's powers. The visual effects range from pretty good to awful in the span of seconds. There is a scene where Woody Harrelson in his Carnage form is breaking a cage and it looks absolutely awful but the rest of the visual effects don't look bad at all. The action and editing are both pretty bad but it's more the fault of the editing than the actual action itself. The editing is very fast paced and cuts very rapidly where it can be somewhat hard to see what is actually going on. This is an improvement from the first film though. One major thing I will give the film is its enjoyment and runtime. It's very short plus it's hilarious. Most of the time it's unintentionally funny but still very funny none the less. I found myself to be laughing at the film a lot more than usual. Even though I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this, I would definitely recommend checking it out. Watching it with friends would probably be the best option.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
95,andymaranam,Pointless,1,2 October 2021,When you consider the character and his enemy being a ramped up serial killer. The things you can do are endless rather than pointless mess which is what this is.It's basically a series of Scooby doo. The acting is badd! Not up to the mantle of the acting calibre at all!. It's a woke melenial movie however you wrap it up.Then again marvel seem to not know when to stop making this crap.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
96,terrylarosa,Walked out,2,2 October 2021,WTH was that?? I could barely hear anything Venom said. Not that it was worth hearing. Stupid infantile jokes for lowbrow viewers. The first one was entertaining; primarily because the symbiotic and Eddie were mostly at odds. Now there like a fighting married couple. Awful dumb dialogue. Perhaps the movie improves in the second half but we won't know till they put in on free cable because we walked out and got our money back. Fail.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
97,timeblank,Worthy Post Credit Scene,8,2 October 2021,The only time that Venom got me hyped is the post credit scene. Please watch the sequel. Forget about the movie and wait until the credits. I am so looking forward to the future of Marvel Studios.The sequel was the same as the first. Totally hated the CGI. Felt so messy. However I do love Tom and Venom's comedic moments. It had me laughing. Carnage was okay. He wasn't conquering the world but only trying to find his love life just to be married.The post credit scene made me forgot about Venom movie. I am so hyped for what's to come. OMG!,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
98,elliotpower2000,Disappointing apart from the post credit scene,6,26 October 2021,I had high hopes for this movie however I was strongly disappointed walking out of the cinema. I found it very boring with little action until the end not much comedy and a seemingly very rushed ending jumping a lot. However the post credit scene saved the rating as I believe it to be one of the best post credit scenes ever and look forward to what happens next.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

100,tresm87,"Let there be Maximum* Carnage is just as bombastic as Venom, and even more ballistic in its overall presentation.",9,25 September 2021,"After what seems like a lifetime waiting for this highly anticipated release through many delays Carnage is here and lives up to the hype. As a 90's kid seeing the first on screen portrayal of one of the most menacing villains of all time, was spectacular especially because Woody Harrelson played Cletus Kasady perfectly. Thoroughly unhinged and viciously hilarious.While the story is that of a basic showdown between the 2 Ultimate Symbiotes, the duel never fails to entertain. Some of the dialogue has gotten slightly more ridiculous in its attempts at humor which can seem a bit over the top at times especially with what seems to be a new voice for Venom which is much more zany than the first. The visuals are what we all come for and they're executed brilliantly by motion capture master/director Andy Serkis. They were able to capture the pure chaos and blitzkrieg that came with these iconic characters in the classic comics/90s animated show. Tom Hardy is once again fantastic as Eddie Brock. The body horror aspects are even more so this time around which also add an extra element to the insane experience. Overall it's a phenomenal sequel that so many have been waiting for and it sets up a ton for the future of the Venomverse/sonyverse.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
101,kaden_lewis,Venom: Let There Be Carnage,10,6 October 2021,"Why are the ratings for this movie dropping. This movie started at a 7/10. Since then, it feels like every day it has dropped 0.1 and I don't know why. I loved this movie. I loved the classic Eddie, Venom bickering, the action, the acting, and just like the first movie, I thought the plot was pretty cool. The Eddie, Venom bickering is classic and never fails to disappoint, every time they fight, you laugh. It is just funny. Their bickering also played a pretty big part in the overall story of the movie. The action in this movie was great. Definitely better than the first movie, and that is sayin something because the first movie had great action as well. The final battle scene stuck out for me, it was just so visually cool, and an overall great final battle scene. The acting was spot on. Tom Hardy is perfect for Eddie Brock, and was great as always, and the returning cast members played their roles great again. Naomie Harris was also great as Shreik, but Woody Harrelson was unbelievable. He was perfect, he played the deranged serial killer role to perfection, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Like I said, the plot of this movie, although short was pretty good. I won't get into detail, but it was very entertaining.In my opinion, this movie was better than the first one, but they were both great. I definitely recommend this to anyone, especially Marvel fans. I hate spoiling things, so I won't, but I will tell you there is a huge mid-credits scene. Make sure to stay and watch! It will 100% be worth it.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
102,d-ramseeey,Let there be carnage!,10,21 October 2021,"It was a great movie series to come back to with Eddie Brock and Venom who has to stop a crazy serial killer who is trying to get his ""love of his life"" back. And by doing so, he was sentenced to death but instead was bonded by the same kind of thing Eddie was bonded with. Now he is going to try to find revenge on Eddie and is not going to stop until he gets what he wants. To stop him, Eddie and Venom must stop fighting to stop his ever reining terror. This is a great way to continue the story and the plot is super easy to understand and it is very fun to watch. But the ending happens very fast and you can very easily miss minor scenes and appearances. I hope you enjoy Venom: Let There Be Carnage like I did. And the fight scene was so good that at first you couldn't tell who would win. So a great job by Marvel Studios and Sony for making such a memorable film. Enjoy.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

A one-time-watch, but you won't miss much if you save it for later, or decide not to watch it.Regardless of what the movie was like, the talk of the town will be the 30-sec post credit scene.

107,hfreinoso,Let this movie be better,7,4 October 2021,"I was always anticipated for Venom 2, and I was always a big Carnage fan. I love the character as he is; several comics and cartoons show correctly; Carnage was a chaotic, deadly, and insane force, hence why he was such a dark and threatening force. So when I heard about the negative things, such as a PG-13 rating for a character like Carnage, who is, like I said, is a chaotic, deadly, and insane force, along with the film only being 90-minute screentime. I started to get quite skeptical. There is no way Sony is doing this to Carnage for the first time on the big screen, and this is how it is releasing. So I didn't know if I wanted to see anymore since the rating was announced and an even bigger oof when I heard about the runtime. However, listening to many positive reviews about the movie, plus having a friend saying it was better than the first movie. So I went to see it with my other friends, and after coming out of it. It was a fun movie, but it still lacked A LOT of quality. Both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson were, in fact, as phenomenal as Eddie Brock and Cletus Kasady. They did a great job with the characters and Naomie Harris and Michelle Williams as their parts, respectively. They were all great, and I am happy for their bringing in this. The CGI and cinematography were good, and I could see Andy Serkis was doing his A-game for this movie. However, the one who quickly stole the show was, in fact, Woody Harrelson as Carnage.I can't believe my boy finally came to the big screen for the first time. And seeing venom and Carnage fight was the best scene of this entire movie. And yet, despite all of this, I am still disappointed with a few things for Let there be Carnage. Yes, both the PG-13 and 90 minutes bother me a lot for the majority of this film. The 90 minutes went by so damn fast; I was shocked with the pacing; it doesn't slow down at all. And before you know it, the film was over already. And the PG-13 rating was an unforgivable man. For Carnage and all the chaos, the PG-13 rating was a significant disturbance for this film. I wasn't happy that they cut a bunch of stuff in the movie, and they didn't make the film go all out when Carnage made all his killings. He is Carnage, he is, in fact, the MOST violent character of all Marvel, and Sony treats him like that. Unforgivable. And some stuff about Kasady bothers me. He wasn't as menacing or as terrifying as he was in the comics. I should be scared or terrified whenever I see him on screen, but nope I wasn't. Sure there were a few things that were true about his character. But a big one is he shouldn't love Shriek that much. He is kind of like the Joker, and HE doesn't care about anything but himself. But they make him care about her too much, which annoyed me because this film gave him a weakness instead of a serial killer vibe with him. Overall the film was fun, for a 90-minute film, but it lacks me to love it. 7/10. And that post-credit scene was a big Woah too.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
108,garethvk,Venom: Let There Be Carnage Has Some Moments But Could Have Been So Much More,6,30 September 2021,"When audiences last saw Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy); the journalist and his parasitic symbiote Venom; had just saved the day and cemented their unusual bond with one another.In the new film ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage""; Eddie and Venom are at the end of their Honeymoon phase as Venom is lingering to be free to eat bad people and do what is natural for him. Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.At the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.With the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus's cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.This leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.At this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as ""Carnage"".Cletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.As any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.In many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.There have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.What we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.Director Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.The plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any ""wow"" moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.For me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.For now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.3 stars out of 5.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

No sequel,4,17 October 2021,"Ok this film is bad, it's my favourite type of movie, in marvel, had 3 great Actors who were all pretty poor in this and it had absolutely no flow. When you learn to right a story you have a beginning, middle and end, they forgot that part.Unsure why they'd rush it, so either they did it to fulfill contracts or just had no ideas, there was no real story here, it was easily the worst story I've ever seen in marvel, it felt like 30 mins too short, just ended, killed stories dead, was just like, dead, bye, generic ending leaving another sequel as an opportunity.Woody was horrible in this, I'm shocked to say that but he was so bad. They should kill this dead now, the first was mediocre and this killed any buzz for this character.The only way they could save this is to tie in another franchise, venom should never be a stand alone again as they've proven here they have no ideas, passion for the character or interest in making a deep world for brock to inhabit, such a surprise but this after that awful ten ring film has me worried that the future of anything outside the home run franchises are not going to be as good .Personally the only way to resuscitate venom for me is one character and that's deadpool, possibly Spider-Man but I think style wise a venom deadpool colab is the only way this character ever has a chance of being relevant or exciting again.I liked the magazine cameo for Stan Lee but I fear now he's gone that there's a real hole in the quality in these films, was Stan the heart?Anyway don't waste your money on this. It's rubbish, even a normally great thing hardy struggled to save this crud.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
111,ha77y73ad97,Venom 1.5 ready for a bigger showdown!,7,1 November 2021,"Theres not a lot to say about this film very simple story, which isnt to say a bad thing, Tom Hardy yet again carrying this movie and some nice visuals through out.On first watching this movie for the BBFC to rate this a 15 i was surprised, until there were some moments of this with Carnage. This starts with a younger Shriek and Cletus being separated and this motive for this rest of this film! Jumping forward to where the first finished, excluding the sideshow Bob hair cut, Eddie is able to figure out where the murders happened that Cletus has been imprisoned for with the help of venom of course. One thing to say is that Tom Hardy shouting and talking to himself really is a joy to watch in this, was in the first so if it isnt broken dont fix it! With the run time of this being just over 90 minutes there can be arguments for rushing through the story and plot holes, for me this just reminded me of an old school comic book movie, Blade, Spider-man 1 and the fantastic four. Before the 3 hour epics we get now a days this was just good verses evil. No real need to understand a serial killer. But seeing Carnage for the first time this was a great break out scene and where i can see the rating coming from! Woody as always brings the crazy maniac to life, would loved for him to stick around a lot longer! Stephen Graham good as always again, setting up Venom 3! Naomi Harris kept slipping from West Indies to posh so was a bit mis leading where they were going for the character!The middle act either needed to be cut or completely fleshed out and neither was down! Nothing seemed to flow until it was time for the big face off. Few nods to other comics and movies with the bells ringing causing both symbiotes issues in the final fight, nice call back! Alot again for this being 2 CGI characters fighting it out! Little bit of friendship saves the day basically.For Andy Serkis to take this movie on was a bit of a gamble, big names, bigger characters with a smaller story! Some awesome horro style shots for this film and truly would like to see him helm the characters again, got the humor and the action was bad. Just needs a script to hold up to his vision!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
112,suvechhabose,"Its like joker directed by Andy Serkis. Actual joker ,not DC joker.",4,2 October 2021,"M sorry , an actor who is famous for not his acting standards but for playing cgi characters like , the ape , Gollum , Snoke
Made a movie . He can make a good movie , but in this case , he didn't. Cause yeah as long as you're making money by throwing stupid jokes & cgi instead of an interesting plot
Who cares man?!& Now about the movie ,
I guess its a good movie if you prefer MGK over Eminem , if you play fortnight & knows every one of it's dances' . Its good movie for you if you like pineapple on Pizza , if you put ketchup over your fries instead of dipping it in ketchup. Same old 17 yr jokes! Thank you for
PG 13 Rating , Oh mY GoD!!!!!! M planning to take my dead grandmom for venom 3.Liked Woody , great actor , deserves a lot more screentime. Loved every second of Tom Hardy m hitting 4 just for these twos butThe movie is absolute dumpster fire.Sony , Stop making mcu like movies .You're downgrading as hell & People thought Garfield's Amazing Spiderman was bad!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
113,Benslie,A very fast-paced movie that's only slow in the beginning,7,3 October 2021,"I feel like the most important thing to bring up with this movie is the pacing in it. The pacing in this movie is fast that it leaves zero room for the movie to slow down and take time to breathe. I feel like for some people this kind of pacing with work for them but for me I kind of wish it slowed down because everything in this movie felt bullet-pointed. The first act of this movie went by so fast that once we hit the climax of the movie, I was like Oh wow it's nearly over. But that's not to say I didn't enjoy what I say in this movie. I feel like all of the actors in this movie were having the time of their lives. Tom Hardy did a stellar job once again and brought so much of the humour that I really enjoyed. I'm not fully sure why but to me Woody Harrelson just didn't work for me in this movie. I could tell he was doing his best and trying super hard but I just didn't really care for him and his character in this movie. I mentioned the humour in this movie earlier and I feel like it might work for some people and not for others and surprisingly it worked for me. I caught myself laughing quite a bit while watching this movie. The last thing I'll mention is that Andy Serkis was a great pick to helm this project and direct it. In the end, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a VERY fast-paced movie that has a slow first act that picks up in the second. There is only one post-credit scene that you should definitely stick around for.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
114,tyesonbebee,Lags in some parts but Better then Shang Chi,10,1 October 2021,"It was fun movie, Carnage was dope the ending of the movie was dope. Seeing Venom go out and party was fun. All around an awesome movie!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
115,arod_85,Bad. Just bad.,5,10 October 2021,"I wasn't a big fan of the first Venom, but I still watched because I love me some Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson. I figured the cast and premise was enough to give Venom a second try. I regretted that try within the first 10 minutes of the movie. Maybe I missed something's but this movie just seemed so thrown together. You would have thought the delays from Covid would have given them sufficient time to iron out the issues and fill the endless potholes. Sadly it didn't. I didn't think the screaming lady or even Carnage contributed that much to the story. Would have been better just trying to see Eddie adapt to his new life with Venom and evolving into a ""hero"" instead of adding all these other characters and concepts that ended up being executed so poorly.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
116,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,Fast-paced sequel featuring Tom Hardy's comedic double act,7,24 October 2021,"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a trashy fun sequel that never stops to breathe. Director Andy Serkis and star Tom Hardy, who also penned the story, play up the strengths of the first Venom and double-downs on the comedy.It is a funnier and more confident movie than the first. I laughed a lot at the gags. Tom Hardy's committed double performance as Eddie Brock and Venom, constantly bickering like an old married couple, remains the price of admission.The first Venom had a sluggish uninteresting first act, taking a long time setting up its story before Venom and Eddie Brock ever meet. In Let There Be Carnage, Andy Serkis compensates with a straight-to-the-point approach that moves like a rollercoaster and dispenses with self-important world building and teasing the next installment, which becomes the film's strength and weakness.Unfortunately, at a 97-minute runtime, Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson do not have enough time to chew scenery and build a dynamic between their characters and are rushed along to service the plot.There are also less oddball spontaneous moments like Eddie Brock climbing into a lobster tank in the first film. It's hard to tell with its rapid pacing. The comedy, centered on ""what the heck"" moments, could have benefited from more awkward pauses. Every scene is truncated in such a way that I expect there's going to be a 2-hour director's cut on home video release later in the year.The adults who have read Venom since the nineties are all itching for an R-rating. There are missed opportunities for some R-rated violence that will have the adult comic book fans thinking about what the real Venom would really do. Personally, the CGI-laden fights were the least interesting parts. It is during the fights the film feels like a Marvel film, which it isn't.What Venom: Let There Be Carnage will appeal most to, in fact, are ten-year-old boys. To them, Venom is the coolest looking irreverent comic book character and kids can enjoy it as a fun dark thrill within safe PG-13 parameters.The ideal audience for Venom: Let There Be Carnage is the adult comic book fan father taking his ten-year-old boy to a matinee. They'll laugh together at all the gags and cheer along when criminals' heads are being eaten. Afterwards, they go home and the mom asks the dad, ""Why did you take our son to that?"" The dad struggles and replies, ""I can't explain it... it's just fun!""While it won't elevate the Sony Spider-man Universe franchise out of its underdog status from the dominant Marvel franchise, Venom: Let There Be Carnage's biggest strength is that it doesn't take itself that seriously. If you liked the first Venom, you're most likely going to enjoy the sequel. If you didn't, then definitely no. It is that simple.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
117,alexscott-35299,What a waste of money!,4,16 October 2021,"The whole production of this film was just a massive waste of time and money. This is easily the most disappointing movie of 2021! The acting, to say how good the cast is, is absolutely shocking. Tom Hardy is awful in this, the jokes and comedy just feels forced and unfunny, the action is hard to see because of the god awful CGI and the plot is just boring and clearly unfinished. The film just isn't long enough, it's too short to be able to fit any character development so the film just fly's through all these plot points and you don't get to process anything that happens. Carnage is wasted and that really upsets me as he's one of my favourite villains in the comics and now he's been used in one of the worst marvel films. This film is just a big mess and I wish it was just left in the oven for another 2 years so maybe we would have got a film that was actually worth watching. What a loads of crap!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
118,jebyvyson,Same as the first.,4,3 October 2021,"This movie had the same issues as the first movie. Rushed, editing all over the place, corny ass writing, questionable moments, and the side characters aren't interesting. I wasn't surprised this movie was going to be PG-13 considering that Sony wanted Venom to be in the crossover timeline in the MCU. Also, I hated that Venom was more of a comic relief in this movie than he was in the first movie and the villain, Carnage, would've been cool if this movie was rated R and I honestly couldn't Woody Harrelson seriously. The action was fine, the CGI was good, some jokes were funny and some were lame. I always see a Venom movie having potential being good as a standalone without Spider-Man, being accurate to the comics with its own spin take on it. I guess this is all we're ever going to get from a Venom movie with Sony only caring about how much money they make rather than a good comic book movie.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Actually there's no reason why this couldn't have been a fair movie. It has it's funny moments, a good cast and an ok story but it just feels badly put together and badly directed. Why is Golem directing movies anyway.This just feels like a waste of a talented cast and the whole venom/Hardy partnership.

First, Woody's hair, we know how it was in the first one, and the haircut after, damn! A joke. Not to mention his clothes, Jared's Joker from SS. Second, Venom's voice. Not the same and talkiiiing wayyy too much and too many jokes, some good but many unnecessary, is this really the sign that marvel will take over? The story was superficial, the conflicts were easily resolved. Felt like lazy writing and quick ended. Third, Carnage voice, they could've done better. The story focused too much on their relationship like who gives a damn? Too much drama from that point of view. One thing they got right and pretty cool, Carnage design and details. The colors and the blades were really taking me in the The Animated Series Vibes, until he started talking..

122,PerryAtTheMovies,Let There Be Carnage?,6,1 October 2021,"Score: 68/100 (6/10)I'll preface by saying two things. First, I'm not familiar with the comics, so this review is based solely on the movie. Second, the first one was way better in my opinion. I gave it a 9/10.The visuals were pretty good in the whole of things. I didn't really see anything that made me cringe at the CGI. It was fluid throughout. The biggest thing I look for in CGI are vehicles and buildings and I was pleased how both looked. Everything felt real, especially, when they were getting destroyed.The fight scenes were both cool and fun to watch, as well as a bit messy. While it wasn't difficult to understand, or follow, some of the scenes seemed to be cluttered with a lot of stuff. This made the overall enjoyment to be had, hard.As with the first film I enjoyed the relationship between Eddy and Venom, however, the comedy between the two felt a little to forced. Like life had actually gotten to them and they were tired of each other's BS.The other titular character, Carnage, was cool to see. Somehow he felt under utilized and kind of wasted in this film considering it was supposed to be about him. I didn't end up liking Woody Harrelson as the Carnage character, but I did enjoy him as the psychopathic killer. It felt like a classic Woody being Woody.As with the fight scenes the story felt messy too. At times I felt like there was a weird jump in sequences or the timing of why we were brought to a certain place. It just didn't sit right with me.Overall, not a so bad movie. It didn't leave me as moved or happy as the first film. The relationships felt wasted and droll. Visually stunning, but sequentially a little messy. You may or may not be pleased with how it turned out, but I will say it was a least worth the trip to the theatres.That's all for now, I hope you enjoy the show!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Can't say I'm fond of that and believe they should keep him just bad.Which is why I hate them trying so hard to make him look like a superhero, it just doesn't fit the character imo. Idc if the host has some effect to the symbiotes, reading the wiki implies they are straight up made of hate/evil from Knull.Carnage is a giant letdown, thanks to the fact PG-13, you have this dark and disturbing movie or its suppose to be. Except they hide every aspect of it thanks to family friendly death. I mean wtf is the deal either show it or don't make the film period. Not saying show Mortal Kombat gore 24/7 but its a bit ridiculous, might as well make Deadpool PG originally.They rush the movie like mad and it shows big time, you don't care for anyone new. Didn't care about the cop, didn't care about Shriek, didn't care for Carnage or Cassidy. Felt like forced/cliché moments galore. For some reason cops at an maximum jail carry only pistols. What is with hollywood and only pistols.People were clapping at the end and I didn't get why, its a weak movie.

Harrelson is great as a serial killer and Carnage but the CGI is not used to full advantage for humor or violence. This could have benefited from an R rating but only with the right people handling the production. I know they wanted a younger audience and maybe that was the right choice, just saying. Michelle Williams is excellent and they should have used her more using greater flexibility. She does great comedy. Shriek was used and abused, by the writers. There was more in that character but she does make a kick-ass bride (what, no white wedding Billy?).Despite it's shortcomings I enjoyed it for the humor alone and recommend it if you have any interest at all in Venom.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Or at least the two could have occasionally come face to face in between and then finally meet at climax for the final showdown (like in spiderman 3, spiderman and sandman's rivalry) but sadly they have just one sequence and thats it!VENOM carries forward those hilarious Venom-Eddie banters from the 1st part and this is the only thing that clicked. We really had a good laughter session while witnessing venom and Eddie argue.You ultimately realize, this film is more focused on the Eddie-Venom relationship rather than Carnage and this disappointed me but still i quite enjoyed it thanks to the comic timing of venom and some decent action at the end .",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Compared to Wenwu from Shang-Chi, Cletus Kasady's sole purpose was to ""bring carnage"" by beheading some people, breaking public constructions, setting some fires, and stealing a car, while Wenwu was a presented as a miserable narcissist and a relatable father. Anne, Dan and Mrs. Chen who are suppose to outbreak laughters with protruding personalities served only as disposable tools of the protagonist and the plot, and with completely brainless actions: I mean showing off your wedding ring in front of your ex and expecting him to congratulate you is definitely something a normal person would do, right? Lastly, and relationship of Venom and Eddie, it's the only thing that keeps me watching, it's beautiful, funny, and mesmerizing, absolutely awesome -- I'm obviously joking, it's like the worst soap opera multiplied by itself.

145,jannikpeveling,Fun to watch but disappointing at the same time,6,30 October 2021,"After the first Venom movie and after I saw the PG-13 rating (12 in Germany) I knew that we will not get the Venom movie we (or I) want to have. And even with going into theatres with these expectation I was disappointed at first.In the whole first half of this really short movie nothing really happens, we just get funny scenens with Venom and Eddie. Also, Celtus Kasady, the antagonist is just introduced like: Look, he is a serialkiller and look, there is Carnage now. Very disappointed at this point even though I had not the highest expectations going into it.But the second half of the movie where all the action happens was pretty dope I have to say, Carnage looked awesome and the CGI Fights were really good and really fun to watch.If I rate this movie after the Venom movie I want to see (R-rated, blood, horror and a few funny scenes with Eddie and Venom), I probably would give only 3 or 4 stars. But I don't rate it like that because I know that it is a funny, loud, PG-13 rated popcorn movie and it is only fair to rate it after this.

146,roondogbb,Excellent sequel to Venom,9,18 October 2021,"Rarely does a sequel outclass the prequel but in the case of Venom: Let There Be Carnage. This movie simply built upon all that was good in the original Venom movie. The excellent interactions between Tom Brady's Venom were very funny. The jokes were mostly humorous and none fell flat as far as I could judge from the cinema audience who were constantly laughing. The cgi carnage (the villain in the movie played by an excellent Woody Harrelson) and Venom were top notch and didn't look cheap at all. Seamlessly emerging and submerging into human bodies. The plot although not the most
elaborate or intriguing sees Venom face of against a stronger bigger version of himself..... Eerything else in the movie is a set up to this, and that's fine, lots of the set up is a good ride. As the movie didn't have any plot holes and was fun to watch, it's comedy for me being was its biggest draw then the action. With most super hero movies these days, they tend to take themselves so seriously and are bit too melodramatic at times. There was a breakfast scene in this movie that just made me smile. Also this movie isn't tied down to the complexities of an extended universe which helps towards keeping it simple and fun. Definitely a 9/10 as superhero movies I've seen over the last view years. It's the perfect combination of not taking itself seriously while telling the story it needs to tell. Go watch it!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
147,guskeller,A big pile of nothing,5,1 October 2021,"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a one trick pony that doesn't land its trick. The entire movie is filler stalling for its final battle, yet that showdown is disappointing. Yes, it is between two marketable comic book characters, but that's all it provides. The villain is underdeveloped and uninteresting, the imagery is sloppy and cluttered, and the choreography is nonsensical. Because there is no coherent style or vision, the sequence ends up being a big, ugly mess. Normally, the details of an action sequence wouldn't be so significant, but that's all this film invests in.Everything about the story is rushed, repetitive, and uninspired. There are no intimate moments to allow things sink in because the script lacks substance worth meditating on. The humor is okay at times, Tom Hardy is talented enough to have chemistry with himself, and effort went into the CGI (though it was overused). However, besides that, this production is pointless. Even the violence is unsatisfyingly suppressed for that PG-13 rating. Undoubtedly, some fanboys will be content with a mediocre fight between two characters they recognize, but as a film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a noisy pile of nothing.Writing: 2/10

148,Entertainmentsparadise,I got Goosebumps,6,2 October 2021,"**No spoilers**This is a must-watch. Just off the end credit scene alone; for all my marvel fans, this is the moment you've been waiting for.Let me get back to the film, Venom: Let there be Carnage uses the same structure as the first installment( established the tone, introduced the issue, showcase issue with character development, end with an action-filled battle). This time around, the film updates us on Eddie and Venom's relationship while gradually building the plot up by introducing characters; resulting in a cinematic climax between Venom and Carnage. The comedy aspect is more engaging and funny.I enjoyed this film, making this more comical server better displaying Eddie and Venom's relationship. I am confused about the creation of carnage because it isn't clearly explained, especially if you are versed with the first installment. Also, I question the similarities to the first. Not enough for me to not like this movie nor say it wasn't better.Verdict: If you are a Marvel fan, you should already watch this film. This is better than the first; yes, there are some questionable aspects: the similarities, clarity, and subordinate characters' importance. Yet overall, it's a funny, action-filled movie!6/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Bottom line, this movie is stellar.Sure its a bit goofy, which I found to work steadily, sure its a little conventional, but I came to see a good movie. I walked in expecting a blahzay, cringey movie, but it was dope.The action, the dialogue, the dynamic between Venom and Brock was awesome. The movie had a 2000s feel to it with all the polish of the modern flicks of late. Sure its not as universally awesome as Endgame or a movie like Logan, but its a very true to form comic book movie.

This is a sequel that commits to the humor and tongue-in-cheek tone that should have pervaded the first film. It's absolutely hilarious throughout.Also among the improvements are...Improved pacing (the movie FLIES by)
Stronger characters (Eddie and Venom actually go through a self-discovery arc together)
Better action sequences (they're lit properly and most of the time it's clear what's going on)
AND
a better villain! Woody Harrelson always gets the right tone and his performance is ferociously entertaining.Also, Mrs. Chen. I love Mrs. Chen.As for negatives, the villains have a backstory that could have been interesting but is never explored. Also, there are several plot elements introduced at the end that really don't make sense and are ever explained. But none of them were particular important enough to kill my enjoyment of the movie.Lastly, the soft PG-13 rating kills the action.

162,thokocnamangale,Not so much carnage,7,2 October 2021,"Marvel took it's usual approach to recent films and added a lot of humour to this, which was great, especially in the beginning. And as you would expect, the visuals were something to behold and really brought venom and carnage to life. They worked well with the story but it felt somewhat rushed, despite this being a 2hr movie, but it was atleast there and they gave Cletus and Francis a reasonable back story.What disappointed me was the action, or the lack of. From the title and name, well you'd expect Carnage to be chaotic and destructive especially considering he was attached to an already violent psycho unlike venom, and he was but everything felt held back; Venom too, though it kinda made sense considering where Venom and Brocks ""relationship"" was with their rules, yet you still expect him to be unleashed especially towards the end when going against carnage, who was supposedly sooo much stronger and venom feared. It was also surprisingly not bloody, despite the violence. Part of me feels like the rating could be the problem, which restricted the creators from exploring darker more violent themes. They didn't even show venom properly feasting when chopping heads off, not even the chickens.A bit anticlimactic as well, the venom vs carnage fight could have been it but the action didn't deliver. Great visuals though. When we came out the cinema, I could hear everyone talking more about the post credit scenes than the actual movie itself. It's kinda sad having that as the highlight.All in all, I think it's a good movie, most definitely worth a watch but it just felt like they didn't let everything out the bag. It's a really fun and funny movie, just needed a little more chaos.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

164,JoelAlexanderr,An aggressively unfunny misfire that should be completely rewritten or scrapped,2,5 October 2021,"Marvel fans could be described as passionate and intense, yet they weren't exactly demanding that a second Venom movie be released. Despite this, now we have VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE, a movie that is created with decent enough concepts and intentions, but which, in execution, ends up being one of the uninspired and difficult to stomach superhero films of the past couple of years. The Disney superhero films are known for their use of awkward humor, for better or for worse -- LET THERE BE CARNAGE, a Sony-produced film, makes Marvel look like comedic geniuses by delivering an onslaught of flat and downright boring comedy that makes this Venom film come across as the worst buddy comedy since the Will Ferrell Sherlock Holmes movie.The previous Venom movie -- which, although by no means great, looks amazing in comparison to its sequel -- included a decent amount of humor that revolved around Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock, a struggling journalist, and Venom, a parasitic alien who attaches himself to Brock and begins a strange friendship with him while supplying superpowers. The humor was very much a polarizing aspect of the first film, and with LET THERE BE CARNAGE, Hardy (who is both a writer and producer on the film) and crew decide to double down on the humor and get rid of almost everything else that could have made this movie even the slightest bit interesting.The film has almost no actual plot besides the relationship between Venom and Brock, and a cheesy serial-killer villain played by Woody Harrelson who also gets a symbiote similar to Venom (but more powerful somehow? This is never explained) inside him because he bites Eddie and tastes his blood. Not once was I actually invested upon either the villain or the protagonist, nor were there any stakes for any of the numerous CGI fight sequences that fill this movie. I understand that the filmmakers were looking to create a goofy and ridiculous action romp that doesn't take itself too seriously, but they neglect almost everything that makes a movie good in the process, rendering any attempt at camp moot. If one makes a ridiculous and goofy movie, and then proceeds to forget good plot, humor or characters, I don't see any point in producing said movie.None of the acting is terrible in this, but Hardy, Harrelson, and especially Michelle Williams feel as if they're trying to make the most of a script that was written without much thought or care injected into it. The expository dialogue near the beginning of the film feels like it was taken from an ""exposition dialogue generator"" that someone Googled for lack of a better source. Some of the jokes throughout this movie are somewhat funny in concept, but in execution the punchlines rarely land, making the majority of scenes feel as if the characters are part of an inside joke that nobody told you about.I must say, I was skeptical going into LET THERE BE CARNAGE for one big reason: the runtime. The movie clocks in at exactly an hour and 30 minutes, which is the shortest it can physically be while getting a theatrical release from the studio. Very few movies I have seen can make that short of a runtime work, and almost all of them are either animated films or horror films. Going in, I expected LET THERE BE CARNAGE to be a rushed and disorganized experience to some extent, and unfortunately I was spot on. The first 30 minutes seem as if the writer was trying to get through as many exposition plot elements as fast as humanly possible, making none of these elements feel believable or interesting at all. Even though I didn't want to sit in the theater with this film longer than I had to, I feel the movie would improve if 15-20 minutes were added to give the characters more weight or to give the story more of a dramatic pulse. Instead, it seems the filmmakers did the bare minimum that was possible in the storytelling department, which at the very least makes for a movie that won't waste too much of the audience's time.It seems that VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE is making more money than any film to be released since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, which makes me lose some of my faith in humanity (Although to be fair, I contributed by spending eight dollars to see this film). I am just hoping that this success doesn't mean the studio will decide to fund three more Venom films of the same quality. In about two months, I feel that the world will forget this movie existed, save for the after-credits scene, which is more interesting than the rest of the movie combined even though it makes no sense. Maybe I just have no sense of humor, but VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE struck me as one of the biggest misfires of the year from a major studio, and I very much hope that if more movies are made with these characters that they vastly improve almost everything.D.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
165,penofinspiratin,Results of a hyped mess.,3,4 October 2021,"If I wrote a Marvel Bible, I'll call this verse THE END OF DAYS.Venom was hyped because it dropped during the hot streak of marvel Kickin ass on the ""superhero age"" in Hollywood.This sequel was a pile of "" lacking ideas"" the lets abuse the idea of ""goofy superheroes"" who have to joke about everything and we must water down everything to accommodate the small ones who happen to be the biggest spenders in revenueAfter all, we are not about entertainment, we are a business.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
166,jaredkjacoby,Comic Book Insanity Round Two,6,2 October 2021,"After the events of the first film, Eddie Brock is trying to regain his footing in his career of journalism while still dealing with Venom in his body. He interviews serial killer Cletus Kasady to get whereabouts to his victims bodies and to confirm his crimes. Kasady on the other hand is trying to reconnect with his childhood friend, Frances Barrison. He becomes one with Carnage moments before his execution and he can now carry out his plan.One thing I will say about Venom: Let There Be Carnage is that the villains are huge improvements over the bad guys in the first film. The first film had very generic and one-note scientists that just talked about experiments. Riot was also sadly wasted. Cletus Kasady on the other hand oozes with horror even before he becomes one with Carnage. Woody Harrelson makes this character work with his emotions and eerie politeness. The scene where he is telling Eddie about how he killed his grandmother and mother stands out to me for its creepy atmosphere in an otherwise goofy comedy. His relationship with Frances is also well done and it gives him a solid motivation for his character. Even the most evil people can have a person they love. Speaking of Frances, I really liked her too. I felt bad for her at times and I liked her power. Naomie Harris played her well. She looked so broken mentally. And of course there is Carnage who is incredibly frightening. However, I think the film misses the opportunity to make him more frightening because of the rating. It would have made his kills more effective as he rips through crowds of security officers even as they beg for mercy. Overall, the villains are great here despite some flaws.On the heroic side of the story, the movie focuses a lot on the relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom. Their chemistry is what made me enjoy the first film so much as well as Eddie reacting everything weird happening to his body. It helps that Tom Hardy gave one of the most cracked performances I have seen in a blockbuster film. The first Venom film had Hardy doing so many weird things on screen you would believe seeing in a comic book film and saying several hilariously bad lines. His performance is more tame here and while it is better, I think I prefer his take in the first film. Venom on the other hand is a riot. He is much more rebellious here, but he is making a genuine effort to bond with Eddie. The scene where he cooks breakfast for Eddie is both hilarious and oddly sweet. Their chemistry still works here for the most part, but their banter can get old because it can get repetitive when they stay on certain topics. However, the entire time, I could not help but think of them as an old married couple arguing. Their friendship will either make or break this film for you.As for the other narrative aspects, this film is an improvement over the original in several ways. The story and characters are better which makes it easier to get invested in them. We get to see more of Venom's personality and insecurities which makes him more likable. The comedy is mostly funny. You can tell that this movie caters to the fans who loved the first film with how much it focuses on the banter between Brock and Venom. The tone of the film is much zanier and goofier than the first film. However, it does get darker once Carnage makes his appearance. The humor is funny and usually well timed. The audience had several laughs throughout their antics. The dialogue still has a few lines that made me wonder who green-lit the dialogue, but it is better here than in the first film.Production-wise, I really love the looks that Carnage and Venom have. They look really cool and menacing. Carnage has a horrifying introduction that I think will scare a few people. His design oozes with creepy and coolness. This is one of the scariest villains in a comic book film I have seen from a visual standpoint. The action scenes are fine. The final fight between Carnage and Venom is a lot of fun to watch, but I think I liked the action in the first film more than the action here. The first Venom film I feel had some pretty underrated set pieces. The only standout fight here is the climax which is good because Venom and Brock need to use their wits more here than in the last film. The soundtrack is oddly solid. I did not expect to enjoy the musical score as much as I do, but it had some nice spooky atmospheric music in the score.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a sequel that takes several steps forward and several steps backwards, but I ultimately enjoyed it. What I really respect about this movie is that the filmmakers knew exactly who they were catering to. Not the critics who bashed the first Venom film, but the fans who loved it for its insanity. They went all out with this sequel. For that reason, if you did not like first Venom, you will not like this film. If you had a great time with the first film, you will have a blast here too.Oh, and stay through the credits. Something very important happens.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

170,xanderlm,Epic Sequel!!!!,10,16 October 2021,"The inner struggle between venom and brock as they try to reconcile their own differences, and their individual outlook on life combined with their external struggle with chocolate, love life and the rest including carnage, is a great way to build character development. Because we understand their inner struggle and desires we know how much harder it is on them in the external world and the plot.The way that we go through the inner narative of brock and venom, in parallel to developing Cletus's romantic relationship to Shreik and his symbiotic relationship to carnage, is a great way to show parallel script writing and use of cinematic editing to develop the converging Anti-hero's journey to battle his Son and nemesis.The father son relationship between carnage and venom, and the toxicity that is made of all the characters with incompatible relationships, is a great way to build up the tension throughout the film before the final battle and convergence of all conflicts from the parallel stories.Venom is struggling to be compatible with his symbiotic host brock, as is Cletus and Carnage. Venom is struggling with his ex as she is about to marry someone else and he still hs feelings for her. And Cletus is forcfully kept away from his one love as he desperately want to break himself and her free from the shackles of the government. All these toxic relationships and the final battle at the end of this film gives the viewer a satisfying ending. Not to mention the excitingly news in the post credit scene.This film deserves 5 stars for its parallel story structure and great character development along with cinematic cross editing between unfolding character plots that ultimately converge for an final epic battle.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

175,ethantoy,Venom: Let There Be Carnage Review,7,6 October 2021,"Venom: Let There Be Carnage, is the highly anticipated sequel that dwells into chaotic action and introduces a expanded story on the bond between Eddie Brock and Venom.I will say that this movie is by far a lot more fluid and polished than Venom 1 was, and has a little bit more depth than the first one did. Now that isn't speaking too much volume to the movie itself, because it still suffers the same pacing issues the first one has.There are some pretty good moments scattered throughout the movie that stick out well and there are some things that probably should've been expanded upon more or had more in-depth coverage of. The action was improved much more compared to its predecessor and it looks great. The villain is awesome, and Woody Harrelson did a fantastic job of portraying Cletus Kassidy. Tom Hardy as usual has done a phenomenal job for both the voice and acting of Venom/Eddie Brock. I noticed complaints about Venom's voice but it wasn't all too different from his first film either.My main complaints that I found with the film was the lacking in Carnage's motivation/goals and the development overall. There were so much things that didn't stick out well for me with how Carnage was portrayed as a symbiote, and it just had me more so confused- similar to Venom's sudden change for staying on Earth from the first movie. The movie is incredibly fast, and burns through its short runtime giving the audience everything it has upfront. The best way to put it is the first hour of the movie contains the Eddie/Venom relationship, and the last half hour is Venom VS Carnage for the rest. Unfortunately, it just suffers the same pacing/writing issues that the first one has, but because of how chaotic and packed it is, it's much harder to see the poor pacing/writing.The movie overall is totally for fans of Venom and Carnage, it was never intended to be a down-to-Earth replica of the comic books and it was definitely not meant to be taken seriously, it's a fun movie nevertheless and it engages with the audience with its comedy and action scenes. It's a great time to watch the titular antihero go against his arch nemesis in cinema.I would recommend anyone to see it if they enjoyed the first Venom, but those that didn't really enjoy the first one probably won't see much of an improvement here other than some small updates made to the fights and relationships. The post credits scene is worth the film alone, but that to me is what takes away from the film in its entirety. The post credits scene is remarkable and probably one of the best post credits scenes we will ever witness, but it takes away the attention from the film itself. Regardless, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a great action film full of mindless absurdity and chaos that will satisfy avid MCU and comic book fans for the vast majority.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

181,phobicsq,Carnage... More like Friendship,4,3 October 2021,"Seriously, you call your sequel let their be Carnage yet make it pg13 which limits everything! Carnage has always been about violence and to a certain degree as is venom. It's bad enough they made venom ""good"" they sterilized carnage as well! I had such high hopes for this but was left saying what the F!This film should be rated low AF but sadly people are so indoctrinated into crappy movies they no longer can make proper determinations.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

183,m-rugen,I need subtitles,6,2 October 2021,"Could barely understand anything Venom says. Tom Hardy's American accent (I nationalized it to American rather than just San Franciscan cause it is in NO WAY an SF accent) is also barely audible. Woody Harrelson is to me one of the greatest actors of all time and he did not disappoint. Naomie Harris was forgettable. Overall the movie was too quick. Could have had ten more minutes of material, maybe learning about Cletus' murders rather than them putting it into a montage in the beginning. Certain elements like that made the film seem rushed, which it most certainly was at only 85 minutes of actual film before the credits rolled. I'm all for short movies if they get the job done but to me this one didn't get the job done entirely.Other than Harrelson's performance and the after credits scene, most of this movie is forgettable. Three stars go to each of those factors.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
184,ryanwesthamfan,A fun comic book film that improves in the first film,7,18 October 2021,The Good- There is plenty of action in here that absolutely amazes me. The humour between Eddie Brock and Venom works once again in this one and is something I wish we had more of in the first film. It knows that the relationship between Eddie and Anne didnt work so we get less of that and more of these funny bromance moments between Eddie and Venom. Woody Harrelson kills it as Carnage.The Bad- although I liked the humour I feel that some of it doesn't land as well as it should have especially with the more side characters. Also feel like Carnage was very underwhelming for a character as big as they are in the comics.Overall Thoughts- Overall Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a fun blockbuster that is sure to get some laughs out of audiences while providing some good action and is a definite improvement on it's predecessor so I'm going to give 'Venom Let There Be Carnage' a 7/10.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
185,kuner-59029,Better than I thought,7,30 September 2021,"Ever since the 90s, this story was waiting to be brought to film. You had the video games, you had the comics, but the idea of a live action Maximum Carnage movie seemed far fetched. Well here it is, and it's... surprisingly better than it has any right to be.It's loud, it's dumb, Tom Hard's Eddie Brock still fails to convince, but you won't be bored (aside from the inevitable overblown CGI finale).Sony's new Marvel movies are turning out much better than the Disney ones and better than the recent DC output as well. Enjoy!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
186,DANTEfromDMC,silly but fun,7,3 October 2021,"I dont know how to start, the plot is kinda silly and bad, the pacing and the 90min run time makes this movie fun to watch, relationship between eddie and venom was good but sometimes they forcing some comedy and it worked in some but not everytime. The vfx was better than the first one, pg 13 killed this movie, in some scenes it felt like so much was cut out of the film but overall its fun to watch and the best venom we get on screen.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
187,malice_o_conner,This is more trash from Hollywood,1,4 October 2021,"Someone failed big time, no rephrase that, Hollywood failed big time. I don't know how this even got past screening. I would award more points to the effects teams who had a lot to do with this garbage film. I really love Tom Hardy's abilities and he was a slight saving grace to this trash-fire. The worst part is the writing, none of it makes sense.It shows throughout that Hollywood doesn't know how to write anymore, the dialogue is bad, and their understanding of these characters are not there. All the lessons from the first are thrown out entirely, and everything that was great from the first are not here for the sequel.For some reason it's not about telling a good story, or having fun with making a movie, it's about ""narratives"" and using their ""platforms"" to spin some garbage narrative that doesn't fit reality, or even fiction. It's too impossible not to tell you how bad this movie is without spoiling it all, but the fact of the matter is - if you loved the first- Do Not See This.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
188,Leungzy,Another poor interpretation of Venom,2,18 October 2021,"I was hoping after criticism of the first Venom movie and seeing how well an R-rated comic movie can perform, that the film makers would make this more geared towards adults. Unfortunately, that was not the case and this film is even worse than the first. Venom should really be a darker movie and this is one of the criticisms I have.The story just feels rushed along with the jokes. Whatever way the movie was edited, it felt like they were trying to compress it into a very short time span and the result feels like a poorly edited B-movie. The whole movie just lacks any real passion or feeling, and feels like it was made for the sake of making another Venom movie.It also really bothered me that you could hardly differentiate between Venom's and Carnage's voice in the movie.I'd have no interest in watching it again, and I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time on it, especially if you are a diehard Marvel fan.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
189,MiroslavKyuranov,Weak Symbiosis,6,1 October 2021,"Look, I'm not a hater, obviously I'm a comicbook fan, but man, this movie was nothing, but CGI fest, dumb humor and bunch of cliches at most. Maybe if you're not invested in the source material you gonna like it, but Venom is nothing, but clown at this point, which he is not in the comics for sure.The dynamic between Eddie and Venom is same like the first movie, it's fine and funny at times, but is more of the same. The Carnage character was ""okay"" at best, it could been so much better. Missed opportunity.Everything is so predictable. If you watch the trailers you'll know 90% of the movie.At the end everybody will talk only about the credit scene, which speaks alot how forgettable this movie is. Not gonna spoil the credit scene, but if you put together 2 and 2 you already know what it is.Also the runtime of 1 hour and 37 minutes hurts the movie so much. There is time for some stupid jokes, but no time for good storytelling, really?I don't know, I guess the general audience will like it, but for me is on the same level as the first one. It's not a disaster, but it's also nothing memorable.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

191,hakan_respect,Venom let there be carnage review,6,31 October 2021,"After 1st movie's financial success, 2nd movie has already been announced and in this sequel, nothing surprises me because Sony used a common formula used for superhero movies. Introduce a bad guy and every good guy or anti heroes unite their power to bring down bad guy/s.The only thing that can surprise the audience is the mid post-credit scene and I won't write anything about it but it was an important mid credits for the future of Venom.This is the second movie directed by Andy Serkis that I have seen and I don't think he has done a bad job. I'm not gonna mention much about actings but apart from protagonists, Stephen Graham did a very good job as detective Mulligan.I really liked the relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom and this relationship leads to some funny scenes in the movie. The relationship was the strongest aspect of the movie.There are some things I didn't like in the movie.First of all, Villain was not so effective, it was just there to challenge the hero.The other side characters don't have appropriate character developments, they are just there to serve hero or villain. There were some illogical mistakes but since it is a superhero movie you just can ignore them for example, symbiote finds a character's place just uploading itself to the computer, how is that possible I didn't get it. Since the movie doesn't take itself so seriously these illogical situations can be ignorable.Briefly, It's like the first movie but this movie is not an origin story so you can expect more from the sequel but don't expect it because you can easily be disappointed.It is not better than the first movie, just don't ignore illogical situations because the movie is so superficial and not detailed. By lowering my expectations I enjoyed the movie and had a fun time. If you like superhero movies you'll enjoy it but don't expect much and don't forget to watch mid-credit scene. Until you see the mid-credit scene you shouldn't leave the theater.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
192,mmansour-007,Very Underwhelming!!!,6,2 October 2021,"I was hoping this will be better than the first one which I enjoyed mainly because of Tom Hardy's performance but unfortunately this movie is almost a copy paste of the first one. It even has the exact same villain but in red!!! Tom Hardy is still at his best and he carried the entire movie on his shoulders. Otherwise, the plot is very predictable and the villains' backstory couldn't be more cliche. Woody Harrelson didn't add much to his character but it is not his fault as the script is really bad and he couldn't save it. The movie is still enjoyable enough to watch but it is very underwhelming.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
193,tpcatoz-90650,A short and somewhat shallow film,7,2 October 2021,"This is film is not awful but it is not great. The story is very short and doesn't really give any characters any depth. If you're looking for an genre defining film, you will be left with disappointment, but if you are a marvel fan and trying to go out and kill some time with friends then it'll be a solid time. Best part of film is the end credits. I'm a biased marvel fan so 6.7 would be my score.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

196,vinifernandes,Let there be Carnage....,4,17 October 2021,"It is better than the first one....But, still a mess.The movie works on a fast paced story, which does not convey any type of sense, and turns a good villain (Carnage) into a terrible disappointment (considering the motive of the villain and the final outcome).Also, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy is an amazing actor, but sttuggles a lot with this character, and his performance just seems unnatural) is portrayed as the dumbest jornalist we ever seen, considering he cannot even make a Google search without Venom.Overall, at least the interaction between Venon and Eddie Brock is something that can be considered interesting and ""laughable"".But they still push it so bad, especailly when Venom goes to the club and starts spitting nonsense on a nonsense scene, with adds nothing to the movie, other than the sadness of Venom, and the lack of identity, in which the director used it to fill in the plot to make the movie bigger somehow.Andy Serkis is a legend, and could be considered a hero ahead of his time, considering the impact of acting and using CGI, he has had. However, this was a disappointing experience, and just a bad movie.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

198,nscoby93,"""I will let you eat everybody.""",4,30 September 2021,"Venom Let There Be Carnage is the first disappoint in the Autumn film season. I had my concerns about this film, and I had almost no expectations, but from the PG-13 rating to the drastically short run time I knew this film was going to be in trouble.While in certain respects this film does certain things better than the first, it tragically also does things even worse. The films tone is all over the place, trying to be comedic yet maintain it's dark tone. Half or more of the jokes don't land, and are terribly placed.Tom Hardy is great as Eddie Brock/Venom as expected, Woody Harrelson is great as Cletus Kasady/Carnage. Yet that is the most praise I can give Carnage, because he is extremely watered down to fit this PG-13 rating. When Carnage was revealed it should have been terrifying, I should have been shaking in my seat. He has the presence, and the acting from Woody Harrelson carrys it, though disappointingly falls flat.None the less there's still enjoyment to be had from this film. Great cinematography, CGI, score, all these things elevate the film. What should've been, what could've been a dark horrifying thriller of a film depicting these characters accurately instead falls on it's face due to short run time, terrible pacing, and incompetence or unwillingness from the studio to push the PG-13 rating or go for the R rating.Although there is excitement to be had from the implications of the mid credit scene, I am personally still left with concerns for the future.4/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

200,ayojerkinskarega,Terrible movie,2,3 October 2021,"Production: Terrible script. Story is a conceptual mess. Okay editing. Some scenes are redundant or oddly out of place. Ok CGI. At times it made it hard to follow the action scenes. 4/10.On screen: Because of the script, the acting was bad all around. It seemed like Tom Hardy was just there to get each scene over with. Character decisions were questionable which made the acting unbelievable. Okay Cinematography. The lighting on the action scenes made it hard to follow. 2/10.Content/Impact: This movie could've had a serious message about the correlation between child abusive parents and its effect on people, which in this case would be the serial killer Cletus Kasady aka Carnage. Could have been controversial if they made the antagonist more sympathetic, it would have made a better, more believable character. This is so because in real life, people aren't all good or all bad. That complexity is what makes humans human and in this case would make the antagonist more believable. Lastly I don't understand why Naomie Harris, Shriek, takes these roles or the fact that the filmmakers still create these demeaning roles for black women in a predominantly Caucasian cast. In this film, also in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies she plays Tia Dalma aka Calypso, she plays a powerful black woman who is and can be controlled by her white counterparts. These filmmakers are perpetrating this stereotype that the only way black women can be powerful is to be controlled by white men. Throughout this movie she's told to shut her mouth and gets slapped around a lot. This Imaging just demeans black women and to let us know that black women are only here to provide servitude and are less than. 1/10.Overall: Terrible problematic movie. Only silver lining, if any, is the after credits scene. 2.3/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Instead we get a little over a tv episode time wise to introduce two new pivotal characters. We're given the briefest of brief back story's and expected to invest in them. No depth. No substance.

The plot and tone are all over the place, and the movie cannot decide on what it wants to convey.

Look, the CGI is amazing as always! The movement of the symboites and the transformations are always on point. Tom Hardy plays his usual self and we love his relationship with Venom! Woody Harrelson as Carnage is the BEST thing in this film. Period! He is terrifying. The banshee lady was eh. The action was solid. That's all I gotta say. BUT these are only the main things that highlight the film. So much MORE could've been added to this movie plot wise, fight wise, and it could've been so much better. I can say you're gonna find more comedy in this one than the first one. However, the comedy is too overdone and overused. Meaning you laugh at it a couple times, but then it gets to a point where it just gets repetitive and then you just sit there with a forced laugh, a straight face and slightly annoyed. Kinda how I felt half of the movie, which is not good. I THINK that Carnage should've just been a movie by itself and only about him, THEN we have Venom vs Carnage. But unfortunately, too much felt crammed and rushed into this. If you're a fan of the first one, I still recommend you go see this one just to see what's up. I can say this though, you're gonna think it's nowhere near as the good as the first one and you'll see exactly why. P. S: You'll LOVE the post credit scene!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

The only plus was Carnage's voice because he doesn't sound like Bane from Batman. But holy smokes, this is such a bad movie that's trying way too hard to be funny. I wanted to walk out of theater so many times, the acting was laughable, Carnage wasn't scary, and they completely wasted him too!

But I must say I was left feeling quite disappointed with this one. In my opinion, Carnage's introduction was far too late. Plenty of time-wasting and lazy writing had filled up the majority of the film. Not much had happened until the last 20 minutes, plus the final action sequence felt rushed.

The story is well thought out and you can expect interesting insights into the world of the antihero. The CGI is at the highest level. It's good that Venom continues and that's still not the end. I have to say the music of the movie was also very good. Even Eminem contributed something to this movie.

227,nickijjohnson-16955,Venom talks way too much,3,10 October 2021,Actually when I left the theater I didn't know what to think. What can I say it was very fast-paced and entertaining for the most part. I just didn't really care for Venom being the comic relief simply because I couldn't understand half of what he was saying and it took too much concentration to pay attention to his mediocre jokes. I know the movie spent a lot of time showing Venom and Eddie's complicated relationship to make a point in the ending that they were symbiotic but after a while it got annoying as opposed to funny. Still find Michelle Williams character annoying. Not useless but annoying. Everyone is saying that Woody Harrelson wasn't right for the part but I never really liked Tom Hardy for Eddy that much either. He looks terrible in these movies. He looks kind of overweight and old when he's normally a good-looking guy. I don't know what wardrobe was thinking for Woody Harrelson's character. They dressed him like a Cuban drug dealer and give him the worst hairstyle. My God is that the best toupee they could find in Hollywood? Really? And another Black Canary character? Snooze. The movie was just okay just like the first one was but better action I suppose.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
228,JTReviewsPlus,Amazing cast and characters carry a mediocre story,6,2 October 2021,"Venom: Let There Be Carnage is an improvement over the original film in practically every aspect. Each of the side characters have more to do, the humor is a lot less cringe, the VFX are better, and the action is more clear. The story itself is more engaging too because there's a lot less exposition needed this time around but that doesn't mean it wasn't a bit underwhelming. Director Andy Serkis wanted the movie to feel like a rollercoaster; a wild ride that ramps up and ends without being too drawn out. He managed to succeed in that idea but the origin of Carnage felt half baked for such a fan favorite Marvel character. A large reason for that is the heavy focus on Brock's complicated relationship with Venom. Although the chemistry worked a lot better than in the original movie, audiences had already seen it before. Carnage deserved much more screentime because he's one of the biggest draws to the sequel and is extremely interesting in his own right. The entire cast did a phenomenal job portraying their respective roles but some regurgitated plot points from the first movie are done here too such as Symbiote vs Symbiote, Venom and Eddie's strained bond, etc only done better. If you are a fan of Marvel or Venom/Carnage this movie is definitely worth a watch but if you aren't this movie might not change your thoughts on the superhero genre as a whole. It's worth noting the end credit scene is an 11/10 though.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
229,micheleshoppingonline,Great superhero movie,8,4 October 2021,Really good film. The character of Carnage is really cool with really well developed cgi. The storyline of the movie is linear and you can easily understand it. Maybe the origin story of some characters they could explain better. There are great scenes of action and funny moments.Best post credit of ever. Don't miss it!,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

I knew what I was going into, so I was able to manage my expectations a bit and because of that, the film met and just passed those. It's good for what it is. What is it? It's a silly yet fun thrill of a good time. It may get a little too silly at times and that may put some people off, but it didn't bother me. The mid credits scene though is a sight to behold and basically makes you forget the faults of the film. Should you watch it? Yes! I just can't promise that you'll like everything about it. I still don't, but I enjoyed it and surprisingly a little more than the first film.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Great character work from Tom Hardy. Woody Harrelson as Carnage was delightful. The editing was sharp. Although I really enjoyed the movie, the pacing seemed a bit manic at times. However, I dont think a 3 hour cut of this movie is necessary. I could nitpick some plot points, but I won't.

Good but not as gritty as other superhero films we've become used to.This one has a bit more to it. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Hardy is great and delivers some superb comedy lines whether as Eddie or Venom.

236,Polotovar,Too much action,6,16 October 2021,"I guess I'd start with how quickly the movie went by. It's only an hour and a half long, with a hell of a fast pace, and I got the feeling in the final scene that the film was short. I'm serious about the fast pace. The whole movie is just action after action after action that doesn't really stop. On the plus side, it's good that I wasn't bored for a second because the movie kept overwhelming me with a ton of action scenes, which were of course excellent. Carnage comes on the scene and the moments with him were awesome. Of course the film is mostly about Venom, who is over the top here. On the one hand, we get a good dose of Venom, but personally I would have preferred if maybe he wasn't here so much. How can I put this. The pacing is so fast that the film lacks room for any story in the finale in my opinion. It could have done with more dialogue here and there in my opinion, and it just wouldn't have hurt to slow down in places and absorb all the adrenaline the film has to offer. On top of that, when we do get some room for plot, it's mostly comedic scenes, which will probably suit a lot of people, but personally I would have preferred a more serious approach. To sum up. The new Venom isn't a bad movie. I enjoyed it. The dose of proper CGI action was fun, but it was just too much in my opinion. So it's both a cool thing, because there's always something going on, and actually the biggest minus of the film, because you just don't stop and there's always some action, and there's also some comedic dialogue at times, which, while entertaining, in my opinion, unnecessarily brings down the seriousness of the plot. This is my opinion. Like I said the film is not bad and I certainly can't say I didn't enjoy it, but for me it is an above average film that I would rather not recommend. Perhaps only to fans of Venom.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
237,BigManFran63920,Hehe absolutely my kind of movie,9,17 October 2021,This movie was made for me. I'm the guy who liked the first Venom and also Bloodshot just because they were purely entertaining and nothing else. This movie is not exception and in fact it's better than the other 2 mentioned. It's big fight at the end looked really cool and the movie had a lot of funny dialogue. Venom was never annoying to me and Woody was a great Carnage.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
238,adamcarlton,just too short ..,6,28 October 2021,"Felt like it was over in about 30 minutes. From eddie talking with cleetus to him becoming carnage and then fighting at the end. It all just happens too quickly and feels like we have very little of carnage being carnage.The film was rating 15 here in the uk, but there was really very little to justify this rating.The best thing about the film was banter between venom & eddie, and obviously the post-credit scene and what it means for the future of the franchise.I was super excited for woody harrelson to take on carnage because he did a great job in natural born killers but it seems like he was holding back a little or like i said he just didn't get enough screen time. This was likely a budgeting issue as im sure it cost millions just to show as much of carnage and venom as they did.All-in-all it's worth watching as a fan but i can't see this being one of those movies i'll come back to many times.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

241,eggrolljr,"Messy, forgettable, but entertaining",5,2 October 2021,"The sequel dials up the camp and tries to hide its PG13-ass by keeping Carnage's destruction as frantic and incomprehensible as possible. At no point does Cletus feel threatening, as Woody Harrerlson parades around with wide eyes and ridiculous wigs, expounding nonsensical poetry that belies clues to his meaningless actions.The pacing of the film makes little sense as the movie hurtles to its messy conclusion at a break-neck speed that allows little room for any sort of character development. Michelle Williams must be getting a huge check for this as she has absolutely nothing to do. The movie is devoid of plot and character development.Having said all of that, Tom Hardy shines as usual and as forgettable as the film is, it does have its moments. This film is simply more of the same, if you enjoyed the first film you'll probably enjoy this one.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

250,alvarax,"Venom, the definition of Mediocre",5,12 October 2021,"Sony once again gives us the bare minimum with this second Venom film, and once again it's a weak and forgettable experience. The only thing that made this film better for me was Carnage, and even then since the film isn't R rated; Carnage doesn't feel as impactful as he should've been.Woody Harrelson did fine in the role, since I feel like he was at least trying with his character. I still don't like Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, he looks like Eddie but to me he's still not acting like Eddie, because he's still too likeable. This film is also too short, since the last act is so rushed and it makes me think that they cut out 20 or 30 mins of footage, leaving us with only one Venom vs Carnage fight, which is disappointing.Shriek also sucks, she's race swapped for no reason and her character is boring, even worse she's shoe horned into Cletus's backstory which just doesn't work. The action is fine, Venom and Carnage look good visually, but this could've been a great film; if Sony grew some balls and made this a bloody R rated massacre movie.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

252,jenkinscammy,Great entertainment!,8,8 October 2021,"Better than the first one, IMHO.This one is much more light-hearted, and plays as more of a action-comedy. Woody Harrelson makes a great villain.There is no forced love interest for Eddie this time around, which leaves more time to flesh out Cletus (Harrelson) and his motivations.As others have indicated, there is some repetition. The conflict in both movies is symbiote vs. Symbiote and the cast is nearly identical to the first movie. However, this movie has a more entertaining story and Harrelson makes a much better villain than Riz Ahmed.Be sure to stick around for all the post-credits scenes - if you aren't excited about the MCU after watching this movie, then you don't have a pulse!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

For a symbiote that has the knowledge of a hive mind that is millions of years old, Venom behaves, reacts and has the temperment of a 6 year old child. In writing this review and thinking about what I watched I have just dropped this from 4 stars to 3. The exchanges between Venom and Eddie mostly fell flat.

260,anuraagt,"Hamhanded, not as good as the first instalment",5,15 October 2021,"Maybe because Tom Hardy was involved in writing and producing this iteration, the movie is a bit too gentle on his character, and doesn't demand enough of him. He was more charming and fun, likeable in the first, with this one he just looks dishevelled and unhappy, morose, throughout. I don't see the character, I see a tired and ageing actor.There's way too much CG as well, the first movie was better balanced in this regard. The banter between Venom and Hardy's character was a highlight of the first movie, but in this second one it feels a bit forced, and the movie fails to make Venom a bit more human and likeable I felt - something about the way he appears and is represented, a bit lifeless. They should have taken a page from Pixar's book, and brought a little more humour to the visual representation of the Venom character. Something creative and bright was missing, hard to say exactly, but the movie just lacked for original ideas I felt.So that was the overall impression - it was not very creative, there were no great little bits of character on screen, or chemistry, or just charm. Felt flat and sort of lifeless throughout, a tad fake and faked. Disappointing.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Wait until the movie gets available on streaming, pop a beer, and let it play in the background while you are finishing up your project for your work. Also, the story is such a wasted potential. Carnage could have 'haunt' Eddie and this would make a really cool monster thriller, but rather it's just a mindless entertainment. Not that it's wrong or anything, but not for me.

The only redeeming quality of this film for me was Carnage's comic-accurate design, and the stellar post-credits scene. Other than that, don't expect anything special from this film.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
263,cyrax-92742,An entertaining thrill ride,8,16 October 2021,"Listen, it's not going to be a cult classic or win prestigious awards, but what this movie is, what it does, is it takes you on a wild ride full of comedy that actually lands more than a few times, more than the comedy in the original one did and some high octane action with symbiotes fighting each other on giant set pieces. The soundtrack was spot on wonderful all throughout the movie and the performances, especially the symbiote voices were stellar.However, the one that really steals the show is Woody Harrelson, be it as Carnage or as Cletus, his flawless line delivery and a dynamite performance give this movie a big boost.There are a few flaws of course, like the Naomi Harris's almost useless character existing for the sole purpose of being a plot device and some weird editing cuts.Overall, script is much more tighter this time around and the acting of the whole cast has improved drastically, visual effects are better and so is the action. If you're looking for a fun popcorn movie and are somewhat invested into the mythos of these characters you won't regret spending your money on this one.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Maybe, it is not, to children whose parents were not of reproductive age the last time Woody portrayed a serial killer with a sense of humor and crazy ideals. I find it viciously funny. But, then, these kids did not see Woody in Taxi. Or NBK. Or White Men Can't Jump. Their first experience with him was Zombieland. And they have no idea why he is funny, because they are children. He was hilarious in Zombieland. What these little kids are mentally incapable of understanding, is that he is always funny. Tom Hardy plus alien symbiote? Hilarious.

Venom 2 does double down on the humor, relationships, overall wackiness of the franchise, and Venom causing carnage(lol). Tom Hardy is better than ever and Woody Harrelson knocks it out of the park. Naomie Harris is also great but underutilized in this movie. It has a short run time but the film benefits from the length. Yeah, it has its typical superhero overblown CGI fest ending.

268,jcsallows,"A very PG13, 90s Carnage",7,3 October 2021,"I'm thinking of the best way to summarize this movie. Imagine watching a Deadpool movie, without Deadpool, it's PG13 and about 20 minutes have clearly been edited out. Also, take all the background music and editing techniques from a 90s, live-action Batman movie, include all the action and CGI in the trailers (because you've already seen it all) and you get this movie. It mostly feels like a mash of Hollywood tropes older audiences have seen countless times.With that said, what carries this movie are the characters. It's so entertaining watching the relationship between Eddie and Venom grow throughout these movies. The banter and dialogue is surprisingly well done and most of the jokes in these scenes are funny. So yes, oddly enough, the best part of this movie is the comedy between Eddie and Venom.All the actors do a serviceable job, but we really only care about Venom, Carnage and their human counter-parts. Although, Ms. Chen is a very lovable character. I actually want to see her return. I will say, Woody really leans into the cheesiness of his character. That Batman reference wasn't random, he feels like a villain from a 90s, live-action Batman movie. The only thing missing from his protroyal were cringey one-liners.This is basically a great movie being held back by too many things. When Carnage came onscreen a lot of the action felt sanitized and heavily edited, then I remembered that this is PG13. You're going to ""Let there be Carnage!"" without an R-rating? It makes no sense. I also think Andy Serkis wanted to make this movie feel like a Saturday morning cartoon from the 90s. Well...he accomplished that. So if that's what you're expecting, you'll probably give this a higher score.I was also hoping for more action scenes I haven't already seen. This movie would be much more enjoyable if you haven't seen all the trailers. There is a ""surprise"" mid-credits scene but honestly, just have a friend tell you what it is. You should just wait to watch this on streaming.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

271,MoviePeek,Venom: Let there be Silliness,6,9 November 2021,"Venom Let there be Carnage marks the return of the titular gloopy goofball that was last seen in 2018's self-indulgently titled Venom. That outing saw the hulking black slime boy Venom go up against another symbiote who was a slightly different shade of black, charcoal? Grey maybe? He was a little lighter anyway. This made the climactic battle between these sloppy boys one of my least favourite finales featured in recent superhero movies. All in all, I wasn't a huge fan of the original, it came and went, and I haven't paid it much attention since.The sequel has one big thing going in its favor, that is this time around the villain is distinguishable from the protagonist due to his blood-red design. But having a villain that looks reasonably different from your main character does not a good film make, and with the influx of quality superhero movies of late, Venom Let there be Carnage is going to have to pull a rabbit out of a hat to compete. The good news is the sequel may not pull a rabbit from a hat, but it does perform a trick that is brisk and surprisingly amusing.Eddie and Venom are trying their best to live in harmony with one another, but this odd couple is struggling to share one body and find a lifestyle that suits them both. Eddie is trying to rebuild his career as a journalist and the story of notorious killer Cletus Kasady may be his ticket back into the big leagues. Of course, things take a turn for the worse when Kasady gets hold of a drop of Brocks blood, thereby transforming him from a deadly serial killer into a deadly serial killer with superpowers.Despite the darkness inherent in the premise, Venom Let there be Carnage is a surprisingly breezy and fun affair. That may come as a disappointment to some who were expecting a dark and shocking tale, but for me, it was a welcome change of pace. I genuinely had a good time with the first half of the film which never for a moment takes itself seriously and knows as much as the audience does, just what a silly premise this whole thing is. This allows the sequel to up the gag count and focuses on slapstick old-fashioned jokes at the expense of Venom and Eddie.This is what I liked about the film most, and far more than in the original, here it is clear that Tom Hardy is having a good time playing the character, particularly the Venom symbiote whose deep strange voice was able to deliver some of the films most amusing moments. This is of course is a departure from the original, which frankly took itself far too seriously. Remember that moment when Eddie jumps in the lobster tank and starts tucking in? Well, the sequel is way way way more of that.So, the film delivers plenty of laughs, but unfortunately when the film isn't focusing on the Brock/Venom relationship things are decidedly less interesting. None of it is by any means awful, but it's dumb and sloppy.Cletus Kasady gets a decent amount of screen-time and the film admirably tries to give him a sympathetic backstory and more human motivations that the audience can relate to, but it doesn't really come together. On the one hand, the film portrays him as an unhinged nut-job, but on the other as a tragic figure. At no point did I feel sympathy for Kasady or relate to him, however, he was fun to watch. Woody Harrelson returns from the first film and now sports a red wig that does not look laughable. Harrelson chews up the scenery like no one else and tries his best to make Carnage three-dimensional, but if nothing else he succeeded in making Cletus entertaining.However, Carnage isn't the only bad guy Venom has to deal with this time around, as Cletus has teamed up with his old sweetheart, Frances Barrison aka Shriek. She inexplicably has super scream powers, a gift she has had since birth. The film makes no attempt to explain these powers, and it doesn't make a whole of sense, but hey-ho just run with it. She and her beloved and his newfound gloopy pal are out to paint the town red (with blood) and rekindle their love. Shriek was by no means complex or three-dimensional, but she was fun and the conflict between her and the Carnage symbiote was interesting and gave the trio a conflicted and complex dynamic.Where so many films try to build a cinematic universe of set up sequels and spin-offs, Venom Let there be Carnage tells a surprisingly focused and intimate narrative that expands on the best parts of the first film. The film is junk food, it's not good for you and you probably shouldn't enjoy it as much as you do. It's a dumb silly movie that never takes itself too seriously. Its brisk and breezy nature may leave some fans enraged, but for me, it was a vast improvement on its predecessor and delivered a surprising number of laughs. A film like this is a welcome change of pace, and there is more than enough room for big superhero movies, as well as smaller goofier gloopier ones too.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

273,dalks78,What could have been!,6,7 October 2021,"Well I was really looking forward to this, as a fan of the 1993 Maximum Carnage comic arc I was hoping that we would see some of that series' magic brought to the big screen. Unfortunately it hasn't quite turned out like that! Firstly the film is in no way bad and it is not the worst Super Hero film ever, but I came away with the feeling that opportunities were missed. The acting is generally good, though nobody will win an award. The SFX and action set pieces are excellent, though you get the feeling some parts were trimmed. Unfortunately the first three quarters of this film basically rehash quite a lot from the first film. We continue to see the internal conflict between Brock and the Venom symbiote and whilst some scenes are funny and add to both characters complexity, the majority are similar to what we've seen in Venom and add little to the plot. The Venom leaving Brock and 'finding himself' scenes, kinda dragged on and seemed out of place. Tom Hardy again does a decent job, but you get the feeling he doesn't get out of 2nd gear here. As for Carnage and Kasady , well though Harrelson is a master of playing manic and demented characters, again he seems to be cruising here. Naomie Harris and Shriek are criminally under-utilised and the tagged on relationship with Kasady does not feel true (would they really still be in love after not seeing each other for 25 years). Shriek's demise also seems cheap and wasteful. Speaking of cheap demise's, Carnage's is frankly a disappointment. After a mutual betrayal with Shriek who then uses here concussive shriek, he is separated from Kasady and whilst vainly attempting to re-connect with Cletus, he is unceremoniously eaten alive by Venom. As for Cletus, well after a brief diatribe, Venom simply loses patience and bites his head off!! Again pretty cheap for an iconic character. I also don't get the ongoing issue from the first film where the Venom symbiote is characterised as having low self esteem and lack of confidence. Pretty much all other versions of the character have him as single minded and psychotic at times, but ultimately brave and protective. Here he even states that ""we cannot win and we will die"" during his climactic battle with Carnage!! Whether Serkis and the script writers can be blamed for these shortcomings is debatable? What is more likely is the need to shoehorn the character into the SCU and now after the post credits scene the MCU, you have to feel they had to soften these characters to hit the PG-13 golden egg!

280,airjordanyk,Tom Hardy and Venom duo are enough to make it a decent entertainer,7,14 October 2021,"Venom LTBC is a very unorthodox super-hero movie that is very unique to MCU counterparts.Tom Hardy is once again nailing it as Eddie Brock, and it's safe to say he has trademarked the character at this point. Unlike the first film which struggled between trying to be serious and funny, Hardy goes in 6th gear with the over the top comedy and bickering with Venom, and it works well for the most part. Another thing the movie significantly improved on were the action sequences. Having a director like Andy Serkis on board means we can expect top notch CGI, and we definitely got that. The final fight scene was spectacular in its visuals. What I liked the most about LTBC is that the film has a very concise goal in what it is trying to achieve. It knows it is over the top and outright insane at time, but that is precisely the elements that people loved about the first one. Andy Serkis simply takes the good elements, and amplifies it with a little more polish.Unfortunately, the movie achieves all this at the cost of many film-making principles, and did feel underwhelming at times. The plot is razor thin and rapid cuts in the editing does make things confusing. Apart from Eddy and Venom, there is very little care given to other characters, and I expected them to make a more compelling Carnage, who wasn't utilized well. Naomi Harris's character of Shriek also felt half-baked, and she didn't have much to do. Given it was only 1 hr and 37 minutes, the movie could have taken another 20 minutes to tell a more compelling, fleshed out story, which would have enhanced LTBC's strengths.Overall I give this movie a 7/10, which might seem a bit high given my criticism, but ultimately it came down to the fun factor and ""buddy cop"" dynamic of TH and Venom which is the highlight of the movie. In terms of filmmaking, LTBC is underwhelming in contrast to other MCU films, but that unorthodox approach is what makes it a fun experience, and allows me to overlook it's downfalls. It is somewhat refreshing to have a movie that doesn't follow MCU's formulaic script, while still entertaining us with plenty of fun moments. That post-credit scene ensures we will be having a very interesting showdown between Venom and this ""other guy.""",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

292,akinchris84,I expected more,4,2 October 2021,"Let me start by saying I have been a fan of carnage since his first appearance back in 1992 in the comics. I played the Maximum Carnage game on Sega when it was released. I watched the Carnage saga in the Spiderman comics. I even have all the comic books of Carnage.There is zero reason Carnage was so watered down. Even in the cartoon he was a ruthless sociopath. There are comics where it is just a bloodbath in the wake of Carnage.Trying not to bring in the bias of what the comics had vs the movie but it is very difficult. People wanted Carnage on the big screen to cause utter chaos and destruction. We (at least everyone I know as well as a bunch of people I spoke with online) wanted Carnage to force a team up of heros/anti-heros.On to the movie...
Cletus was all over the revenge towards Eddie, which made sense (kind of) Carnage hated Venom, which made sense. (That is pretty much where the likeness ended)Shriek should not have been in this movie. She was nothing like she was in the comics outside of her love for Carnage. Which was actually a spur of the moment on the first meeting, ""oh you are psycho too? We are now an item.""Naomi was forgettable, her performance was bad, and she brought in hints of that bad accent she used in Pirates of the Caribbean.Cletus was more concerned about his relationship with Shriek than anything else. This is a sociopath that has a notorious history of bodies in aftermath.Eddie and Venom need to stop bickering, that should have ended with the first movie.Venom needs to stop acting like a child.The humor was terrible and never ending.There was very limited ""greatest serial killer of all time,"" mentality from Cletus, which is something he praised himself for all the time.This was a sob story of Cletus's past, a love story between Cletus and Shriek, a bickering relationship between Eddie and his child-like symbiote Venom and a miniscule battle between Marvel's most notorious villain Carnage and the anti-hero Venom.I have a few questions outside of the terrible plot and script. Why was Venom at a club? He is sensitive to sound, the very thing they used to beat Carnage. In fact Venom is slightly more sensitive to sound than Carnage is.Why was it that Cletus and Carnage were not symbiotic? Those two are two peas in a pod.Why was the CGI constantly showing Carnage with his tongue out? That is a Venom thing, not Carnage.How in the hell are you going to beat Carnage so easily, without help, and kill him off the moment you finally get him on big screen? Even botching the first appearance means you could have taken the feedback and brought him back for a better sequel.PG-13 does not work with Carnage, it barely scrapped by on the first Venom movie.This poor dialog with bad punch lines on dark comics needs to stop. It failed in Justice League, it failed on the first Venom, it failed horribly here.They could have done so much more with Carnage on the big screen, especially with all the pushed release dates. They were out of touch with what the fans wanted. We should have been terrified.4 out of 10 just because I wanted to see Carnage in a movie and the CGI was good.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

306,cifers,Read the comicbooks instead,2,2 November 2021,"I love Marvel and I love the characters of Venom, Carnage and Shriek. I also hate this movie, because it's garbage, just like the first movie. Here some good advice: Instead of wasting your money for this trash movie, buy the comicbook ""Spider-Man: Maximum Carnage"" instead. All important characters from this movie are there, but good!Everything what is wrong in Hollywood, you have present in this abomination of a movie:They try to copy Deadpool, but the humor is not funny, just silly in a stupid way.PG-13, what a joke. Especially with Carnage, who belongs in a R-rated movie.In the comicbooks, Carnage already is very deadly. But in bad movie like this one, everything has to be ""more"". So Carnage is bigger and has all these tentacles (like Doctor Octopus), but bigger is not better. At one point, he spins like a tornado, like the God of Wind Fujin from Mortal Kombat. Ridiculous, this writers don't even understand what his powers are.Bad editing. The cuts are so fast that it's difficult to see what's going on.Not faithful to the source material, but diversity quota. In the comicbooks, the skin of Shriek is snow-white. Noami Harris is great, but they don't make any effort to make her look like Shriek, because of far-left ideology.Great characters and good actors wasted, because of greedy prodcuers, bad screenplay and bad director/editor.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Mostly because the characters are the same from the last movie. Eddie and venom both have no development to their characters. They argue and do just about everything they did in the last movie. Same for everyone else and a lot of characters feel extremely under utilized. The dialog is sloppy and the plot is messy. It kept my attention the whole time but I don't think that means a movie is good or entertaining. I was trying to look at it from a none critical stand point but it just feels boring and a repeat of what we saw in the first movie. Unfortunately.

We are supposed to watch a bloody movie, but what a shame a movie that is not suitable to watch even in the halls
The conclusion is that the movie ""Venom 2"" has no creativity, it is just a commercial movie that only wants money, there is something that made me happy, and it is an advertisement trick that was very interesting and this is the only creativity in this work

This makes Deadpool look like sophisticated comedy.The explosion of sounds and colours in a chaotic blur is less of a hot mess and more like Norovirus mixed with Vindaloo and food poisoning.Stephen Graham phones in his performance whilst wearing a hairpiece that even the bald would reject.Woody Harrelson laughs all the way to the bank. And he laughs loudly.Tom Hardy hangs in there hoping that this will all be forgotten if and when he gets to face off against the Avengers or Spider-Man in the distant future.Even the post credits scene is painful as it's just a remainder of what we should have and how far off course we are.I never thought I'd say this but just rewatch Spider-Man 3 and enjoy a superior Venom.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
317,darksketcher,Slightly Above My Low Expectations,5,25 October 2021,"So unlike a lot of these so called Marvel fans; I air on the side of caution when it comes to Sony distributing Marvel movies. Let's be honest, there's a reason why there's a MCU and Marvel bought out Fantastic Four and X-Men so my review can be trusted. But with that said lets get into it. Warning some spoilers!!In the beginning it shows Cletus and Shriek in an institution exchanging love notes to each other. In this movie, it builds up that these two had a past and they were infatuated with each other. However in the comics, Carnage and Shriek don't know each other until Maxium Carnage. Also Carnage and Shriek's relationship was like Joker and Harley Quinn; Carnage manipulated her while she actually had an infatuation with Carnage. There love is soon disrupted with her being move to Ravenwood because her powers are developing beyond control. She is seen being dragged out and put into a van with a lone officer watching over. Don't you think if her powers were so great that she would be able to take down two cops or they would of have more security escorting her? Moving on. We see an early Easter egg as they introduce the person who will be playing as Carnage's child, Toxic. We then proceed to Eddie Brock and Cletus talking where they stumble upon clues of Cletus's murders. Cletus is then sentence for death but before that happens has a last request by seeing Eddie Brock who then bites him and swallows a part of his blood that has parts of the symbiote. Eddie and Venom get into a lover spat in which Venom leaves and attaches himself to other hosts. The problem with this is that in the first Venom the story suggests only a select few can bond with a symbiote otherwise they die upon bonding. Venom bonded with at least 6 people so either they forgot that little detail or just ignored it. Carnage the wreaks havoc, breaks out of jail and finds his lost love. The interesting part that I failed to think of was that symbiotes are sensitive to sound and Shriek's powers are ultra high sound waves. When she used her powers it hurt Carnage which played a huge part in the final battle. Cletus and Shriek decides to get married and kidnaps Eddie's girl and Toxic to lure Venom into a trap. The epic battle between Carnage and Venom happens and it looks like a draw until Carnage starts overpowering Venom. Carnage then decides to kill Shriek and Eddie's girl. Oh side note, Carnage is a separate entity to Cletus. Fun fact: when Eddie transforms into Venom, Venom uses the term ""we"" because they are two different beings working together. Carnage uses ""I'm or I am"" because Cletus and Carnage are one; a perfect bond between host and symbiote. In this case, Carnage had his own agenda where as Cletus also had his own. OK, back in. Venom uses the power of sound by knocking Shriek into a large church bell which separates the bond of Carnage and Cletus. Venom then eats Carnage; re-absorbing him and bites off Cletus' head. All is right in the world again...or until the end credits show.Overall, I came into this movie believing it was going to be horrible. This movie came slightly above my expectations. Venom and Carnage, in my opinion, was a missed opportunity. I blamed the writers for the poor story. Woody was not a bad Carnage; he did the best he could with what was given to him. I did not like Shriek. She looked like the sterotypic doped up, crack addict, junky that is portrayed way too often. I'm fine with a black actress portraying a white female lead but I draw the line on the look they went with. Toxic was a pleasant Easter egg until they showed him transforming at the end without explaining how it happened. You see his eyes changing but it was never shown when or how he was affected by a symbiote. The end credit was amazing and I felt like the MCU was personally responsible for writing that in. Hope this helps. This wasn't a bad movie, worth a one and done.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
318,dextermorgan-91603,Seriously?,1,2 October 2021,"I had high hopes for this film after the initial decent film Venom (2018) by reuben fleishcher. Although it was critically panned by critics and somes fans alike, it became a decent success. The sequel is nowhere near the previous film, even though the previous film suffered from uneven tone all thanks to Sony and Tom Hardy's idiotic mindset to make a comedy out of the character to appease kids and the director who understod the property correctly, aiming for a horror, mystery and sprinkled gallows humor story.Andy Serkis known best for his motin capture roles as director does his best with an abysmal storyline and banal script. Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson two of the most reputed actors are wasted as they barely give good performances. Naomie Harris as Francis is also grossly under utilized and so is the supporting cast of Detective Patrick Mulligan, Anne and her fiance Dan, Mrs. Chen. Music score is bland, CGI is atrocious as expected with a budget of 110 million in today's day and age when the plot revolves around cgi heavy elements.Sony just trying to pass it off as blockbuster whereas its absolute garbage and much much pathetic compared to the first film. The characters of Cletus and Eddie is absolutely out of touch from their comic-book counterparts where Eddie as a investigative reporter is clueless like an imbecile and Cletus as a serial killer is nowhere near the unhinged psychotic murder from the pages of source material. Shame as i was really excited for the first ever appearance of Carnage. Even the intro of Carnage is pathetic and suffers from pg-13 rating whereas he should be bathing in the blood of his victims and was such a huge threat that Venom allied with Spiderman to defeat him.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

320,spiDey_the_migHty,Who did fast forward it 1.5x speed?,7,8 November 2021,The movie is good. But it felt like the whole movie ran in 1.5x speed. Everything happens super fast. No time to analyse. Everything hits one after one. Yes it's 97mins but I felt it was going too fast like some one changed the speed to 1.5x. It's like they were trying to pack 120 mins in to 97 mins.Better than the first one. Feels more like a love story between Eddie and Venom. VFX of Carnage was great but Venom's feels like unfinished most of the time. Venom's VFX is pretty bad sometimes.Pretty enjoyable movie.6.5-7 for me.Don't leave the theater until you see the post credits. Has a big surprise.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

322,sarkarsaraj,Enjoyable but not astonishing,7,17 October 2021,Movie was quite good with good action music and the performance of cast was quite good especially Tom Hardy acting was brilliant .The humors of the movie was also good specially venom's goofy but caring attitude was likable. The disappointing thing is that the movie lacked density unlike it's prequel. Whole movie was quite relaxed untill the carnage part came though the post credit scene is the most important thing in the whole movie.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
323,fruktoosi,No. Just no.,2,8 November 2021,"There isn't much to tell about this one. Dialogue and screenplay were beyond horrible, something that would be considered poor even in an 10 dollar indie movie. Actors pulled through as good as they could have but due to the circumstances of horrible writing the outcome was beyond saving. I think I never want to see anything this director has or will do in the future. I'd recommend him to consider staying as an actor because this did wrong to the actors and the rest of the crew that came up with this rubbish.The story, oh yes. What story? It made no sense right from the beginning and ended as obviously as one might think. Especially after previous Venom movie, this felt like someone just wanted to take a big dump on it.Venom had a couple of good lines, but unfortunately that's about it when talking about the good stuff in this flick.I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
324,Ellimof,I'm ashamed...,4,4 October 2021,"In simple terms, this movie is bad, like really bad. I didn't like the first movie as I thought it had a weak villain, cliche plot, etc. So I had no plans to see this movie in theaters, but after hearing from some trusted sources and a large census online saying it's better than the first and has a ""spectacular"" post credit scene, I decided to go. With that being said, I still had low expectations and was hoping to at least be entertained. Unfortunately, as soon as I walked out of the theater, I felt tricked.It was worse than I could have imagined and still managed to disappoint. It's an extremely weird movie with fast, choppy scene transitions and short run time. Even the elements from the first one I kind of enjoyed like Venom and Eddie's relationship is bad in the sequel. It's like the studio saw that people liked a few jokes from the first movie and tried to make almost every bit of dialogue from Venom and Eddie funny. Honestly, every character from the first movie is worse in this one. The villain might even be worse from the first as Cletus Kasady is extremely cheesy and over the top. Woody Harrelson is a great actor, but he was bad in this. I felt like I was watching a bad 90s/00s comic book movie. I thought after much success over the past decade plus of good comic book movies, these campy comic book movies were long dead...I guess not. It's not even campy in an endearing way, like the whole movie feels cheap and like a product made solely to make money for the studio. Sony must have just looked at the box office numbers of the first and took that as a good job and not at the terrible reviews to try a truly make a better product. Honestly for myself, I feel ashamed I contributed to this movie's box office...So that pretty much covers the movie itself, but how about that ""spectacular"" post credit scene...
*SPOILERS*Honestly not much to spoil since this movie is bad, but the post credit scene brings Venom into the MCU. The idea of this scene is cool because everyone wants to see Venom interact with Spider-Man, but I couldn't help but be mad at this because I don't want this Venom to have anything to do with the MCU, even if it is a multiverse sort of thing. If this character was going to be brought into the MCU, Sony should have let Marvel Studios make the movie as they would have at least tried to make a good movie. Too late now though...I'm sure if Venom is in an MCU property, he'll be done way better but you can't undo all of the damage that has been done.The few Pros that earn the 4/10 rating:Good Score
A couple nice shots
Nice visual effects at times.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Shriek was an awfully written character. Her dialogue was the worst part of the movie and I was very disappointed with her involvement in the film.Nothing about Woody Harrelson's performance really stands out to me as amazing.story is very fast but only has one fight between the main hero and villain. Could have used a 2nd act climactic scene.Pros:

Sorry to be so harsh but this is a disaster. The comedic elements fall flat, the street was written by a 3rd grade fan boy. It's all just cliche and trying so hard. I use to think Tom Hardy was a good actor. He's showing me how horrible he really is. And I love Woody to death and love good bad movies but this just fails miserably.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
327,parksiet,Movie: slight improvement over the first. End credit scene: freaking amazing!,6,3 October 2021,"So I didn't like the first Venom... didn't even really enjoy it. So it surprised me when I found myself enjoying this one! It's pretty much what you'd expect coming out of the first Venom and just a lot of the same, but ultimately improved in some areas. The one thing that I did enjoy a lot more was that it didn't take itself so seriously, it seemed to have a lot more fun and have a lot more jokes mixed into the movie. I especially loved the Venom and Eddie relationship and how they portrayed it as an old married couple bickering. Their relationship and arguments are easily the most entertaining parts and setup some of the best comedic moments. However the story and movie itself felt extremely short. Before I knew it, it was over and it felt like nothing major really happened. The film moved very fast and felt like was rushing through the plot points and never took any moments to breathe. It felt like it should have been 15 or 20 minutes longer as the story was just too short and didn't seem to have enough substance. The movie just felt like it was missing something. It didn't feel like it really had iconic Venom moments either, like in the first movie did. Tom Hardy is great as the lead once again but much like the first film, he feels underused. He is absurdly entertaining as he argues with Venom though! Woody Harrelson also seems to be having a lot of fun as Carnage but again doesn't really have that much to do in the movie (and his wig is terrible). I also really didn't care about Cletus' girlfriend plot at all. And this just goes back to the story not having enough depth or substance to it. All the expositional scenes seemed to have been cut, there was nowhere for the actors to act. It felt like they didn't know what to do with the characters, only knew that Venom and Carnage had to fight. The only character to really improve from the first movie was Anne, Michelle Williams' character. Instead of her just being the love interest, she actually has a part in the action here. I love Andy Serkis, so I feel like I'm not the best person to critique his directing, which is pretty medium, but I feel that he brought a lot of interesting ideas to the table. Thanks to him, the CGI is much improved over the first film, to the point where the third act doesn't feel like a complete CGI mess. The action is cool and some of the stuff with Carnage is way more brutal than I expected it to be. But it doesn't feel like the iconic fight that it should have been. Also I'm so sick of mental hospitals being in superhero movies... it just reminds me of New Mutants (and who wants to remember that??). But, to redeem itself, the movie plays it's one f-bomb card perfectly! The whole movie had this sort of campy and cartoony vibe to it which isn't much different from the first film, but I'm still not convinced it fits the character that well. It's fun but it doesn't make for a very good or memorable movie. HOWEVER the end credit scene completely redeems it as it is extremely mind blowing and really important to see if you are a Marvel fan! Like this end credit scene makes the whole movie worth it, and is one of the most aggressive and shocking end credit scenes I have ever seen from a business and creative perspective. The movie itself has its moments and was really entertaining to me, but overall is only a slight improvement over the first film.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
328,gunkshotbabyyeaight,Could have been a 10.,6,19 October 2021,"Despite being a huge fan of Venom and especially Carnage, I must say the movie was very flawed. It achieved only about 20% of its full potential.⭕Pros:
1. Great visual effects
2. Great acting by Woody Harrelson
3. Great final fight
4. Great cliff hanger after credits
⭕Cons:
1. Too short. Barely 1h30min
2. Not enough action. There's only 1 fight between them and its at the end.3. Too much comedy. Conversations between Eddie and Venom are constantly them arguing and fighting in a funny way, making you take Venom less and less serious.4. Not enough backstory on Carnage and Venom. Their characters have existed for decades through comics and cartoons, and they put their entire encounter in less than 1 hour. Really did Carnage dirty.5. Few scenes didn't make sense, but were ignored by the writers because the movie is already so childish, and children don't care about logic, just amusement.⭕Overall, I would give it a 6/10.

329,gabrielgarbagni,A little disappointing sequel,6,15 October 2021,"This movie had all the chances of being better than the original, starting with the director, Andy Serkis, who has made a sequel without a proper story arc.Tom Hardy tries his best to play a plausible version of Eddie Brock, but it comes off as too silly and cartoonish to be believable in the first place. On the other hand, his relationship with Venom sometimes works, other times feels too childish and over the top.The villain Cletus Kasady, played by Woody Harrelson, is one big missed opportunity, especially considering Carnage's origin and evolution in the comics. His motivations are superficial and too cliché, while the performance itself isn't really impactful or memorable.At times, it felt like the script didn't know what it was going for or that it was all over the place. The movie itself is too rushed and definitely deserved some more development, as well as the secondary characters who are in the movie for no particular reason.The VFX aren't well done or impactful, neither is the soundtrack composed by Marco Beltrami.In the end, this movie fails at being one exciting story for the Lethal Protector.

We automatically assume it will be better than the first, and when it's not.. you're left disappointed, even if the movie was a bad movie. This was the case here. The good things I will say is the CGI and the action scenes in the last fight were really good. Hardy did a good job as usual. But I really couldn't get into Woody's character. The biggest complaint is that it felt rushed, no character development, and left me needing more details. In what I believe is one of marvels shortest films... they were not able to tell a good enough story. The comedy was... ehh. A little less funny than the first. The best part about the whole movie was the mid-cred scene... and that's sad. But it does get me excited for the future (not just venoms future!!).

Thankfully as the film gains some momentum it gets better, not Citizen Kane better but better none the less. The interaction between venom and Eddie keeps thing ticking over and at times it's even funny and carnage is a decent bad guy and the fight scene is OK, on the whole it's an OK movie.

What this movie did better than the first one was that it developed the villain more than the first one but in its only 1 hour 37 minuet run time it seemed a little rushed. If the movie was not so focused on making jokes similar to that of Deadpool but less funny, they could have developed the story/characters.

338,andrewtmallory,Monster Movie Mayhem,7,1 October 2021,"The nature of this movie focuses more on the relation between the monster and the man. We see how this ripples into society and how they perceive monsters. It's a different kind of Marvel (Associated) movie. It certainly takes a lot of cues from Universal's monster outings of the 30s. Which in turn makes for a chaotic ""super"" movie that harkens back to when they were more experimental in the early 2000s. Not bad at all, just not what you anticipate.I highly enjoyed the detective story on hunting down Cletus's past by using picture clues from Cletus's cell like Eddie was looking at his own comic book. I was disappointed that those elements seemed to fly by into payoffs that felt very coincidental or chopped down for time. Besides some little exposition, this made the later sleuthing moments feel pointless in the end. In my opinion, I would have enjoyed more if the detective work was slower and led to run-ins along the way with both man and monster. This would have lent more to Eddies journey of finding co-existence and his own humanity as he continued to understand Cletus and how he naturally has coexistence with his own humanity and inner monsters.The action was on point in this film and has you excited for the next attacks and scenes. They felt like comic moments from Maximum Carnage (minus Spidey).I also enjoyed their natural use of a Mutant in this flick. Where the MCU continues to drag their feet, Sony will take jabs.The end credit scene definitely enhances the movie and helps it feel like a bigger chapter of Venom than a footnote. Some would say, the credit scene alone is worth the price of admission if you are a comic fan. I can't disagree.Overall outside of my gripes, I really did enjoy this and look forward to watching it again.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

341,jgglborges,Wasted potential,5,8 October 2021,"I'll start with the pros. Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris are absolutely perfect in their roles. Hardy plays a very unstable and uneasy version of Eddie that I really enjoy, his Venom is goofy and kinda strange but it works, I liked it. Harrelson and Harris were so fun as Cletus and Shriek. They seemed to be having so much fun in their roles that I feel the movie was at its best whenever they were on screen. The VFX work in this movie is also fantastic and really sells you on what's going on.Now the cons; and there are plenty. This movie was incredibly rushed. Every single line from this movie felt incredibly forced in as set-up or pay-off with almost no time to enjoy the movie before the next scene starts. Carnage and especially Shriek had very little screen time, which is sad considering they were by far the best part of the movie, and were then very quickly and unceremoniously killed off making it unlikely for them to return in a future, better, movie.This movie felt like it was trying to juggle two movies in one. An origin story for Carnage and Shriek, and a romantic comedy with Venom and Eddie. This idea isn't horrible and I think it could be executed if these separate things were better connected through shared themes but there was nothing there. Let's also not forget the fact that this movie was trying to juggle so many plot lines in under an hour and a half.Andy Serkis was a bad choice. This is his third ever movie and he has yet to prove himself as a director. Serkis was great at directing the visual effects. They were perfectly choreographed with the stunt work and practical effects which helped blend them seamlessly. However, Andy Serkis is a terrible story teller. Every idea from this movie felt undecooked. It felt like this movie needed more time in production and a longer runtime.Let there be Carnage had a lot of potential, especially with how great Hardy, Harrelson and Harris are in their respective roles, but it falls very short of reaching it. I left the theaters excited to have seen such a great iteration of Cletus Kassidy (one of my favorite comic book characters of all time), and incredibly dissatisfied.

There's so much more they could do with Venom and Carnage and the whole romantic comedy aspect falls flat every time. This should have been a horror movie and rated R. PG-13 Carnage is stupid. This is a villain that cuts people in half a lot in the comics and he was resigned to a whiny punk with no explained motivation and little screen time.Woody was a terrible choice for Kasady. He never sells it. The CGI wasn't as good as the first movie. Every single aspect of the ex-girlfriend stuff is stupid. The whole dopey buddy investigator thing is stupid. All of the loser stuff is stupid. The way they used Shriek is stupid.The movie feels short. It's more like an episode of a TV show with a higher FX budget. It's very forgettable. There are no wow scenes. It's got a couple of laughs and some weak fight scenes.Wait for it to come out on Disney+ for free. It's not worth going to the theater.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

The film butchered Venom, the big bad ass symbiote was reduced to a whining little b**ch, that thought he was a comedian. At least the first film had some good moments but I can't think of anything good in this dumpster fire of a film.I think Tom Hardy is a terrible Eddie Brock, he plays him like bumbling idiot. I think Hardy is a very good actor but in the Venom films I feel he is just phoning it in and not even trying, in fact its like everyone that made the movie didn't even try. The special effects look like something you'd see in a cut scene in a Playstation 2 game. Woody Harrelson was ok in parts as Carnage but he was just too over the top.I wish Disney would just buy the Spider-Man film rights from Sony because they have butchered everything Spidey related ever since the Raimi trilogy ended and now they are trying to shoehorn Venom into the MCU with the end credit scene.

There's a new character that doesn't really have any time to shine and is kinda corny & all of her scenes were just hard for me to enjoy. In general I think the dialogue is kinda weak and corny in this movie. This movie just didn't have enough character or heart for me & tried way too hard to be funny.

So exciting to watch this one, and in fact it is funny and pretty good one, but after I watch I searched for Carnage and Scream, I found out Carnage is not afraid of sound but fear fire more, which means actually Carnage can beat Venom easily with Scream's help. Also Scream is much more powerful than in the movie, which made me a bit disappointed.

I told them I was going as a labor of love because I hated the first movie, which I have now seen 3 times (thanks Covid). I ended up liking this movie a lot more than I expected. The story line was very simple which was a refreshing change. It was also 90 minutes, and maybe reminded me of the movies of my youth. No need for Venom to get beat, then rally, then have an epic overly long fight scene. So to the movie creators- thank you- this was a pleasant surprise. Woody Harrelson was also superb. My only criticism is the movie assumes I know things that I don't. I was confused about where Carnage came from, why he called Venom dad and why he hated Venom. I had to Google the back story later but I don't think that should be necessary- and if they needed 10 minutes to insert Comic Books for Dummies 101 for people like me they had time. Maybe it's because we just watched Jungle Cruise, but the CGI in this was very fluid and never distracting. All in all it was an easy, fun night out with the fam.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Introducing his soon-to-be wife, Frances Harrison aka Shriek, who was the polar opposite of Kasady/Carnage, especially with her meta-human abilities, was also an impressive addition.

379,nizarsalim,Better than the First Movie. But.....,7,16 October 2021,"In Venom: Let There be Carnage, there are many positive sides, first, the acting, especially Hardy's performance (as both Eddie and Venom), second, the action sequences, especially the final battle between Venom and Carnage, third, the strict to the point plot, and forth, how it sets up the connection between its universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the future during the mid credits scene.But I can't complete my own review of the movie and get to its flaws without getting into what happens in it. So be aware, spoilers ahead. First, how Carnage is created (when Kasady bites Brock's hand and Kasady swallows Brock's blood, which is mixed with Venom and the color red) is not convincing at all. It is, I can say, and from my own point of view, a very silly scenario. It would have been better if Carnage was, like Venom, another alien symbiote which bonded with Kasady. Second, from the way Venom and Carnage behave in the movie, and how they are presented and created, the movie should have been R-rated to take these characters more seriously. Third, the love story between Kasady and Barrison (which is the center of Kasady's story in the film) is a very cliched theme. It could have been replaced by something which is more serious and deep. So when it comes to the score, I give this movie 7 out of 10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

But this movie is good. It's got good pacing. All about the action and with what time it does expand on the new characters it uses thst time well in my opinion. Now I know carnage isn't gonna be exactly how he was in the comic books. But this movie eventually with the others will have to fit in with the other marvel movies tone they set. A movie for everyone to see. It's still plenty violent and fun for anyone that enjoyed the first venom. Shows the relationship between eddie and venom. It's just a fun comic book movie.

But 5 minutes into this cinematic soup and I was thanking god it was only a standard length film. I can't say my expectations were high but I thought there would be some suspense and maybe a sliver of horror. You have to wonder if a film is worth watching when you keep ending the lines yourself and when every character is a badly cut out cinematic stereotype it gets tedious.This film tries to give the villain a back story which at least explains why they turned out like they did. It's a kind of modern woke way of portraying the nuance of good and evil and level the playing field a little. Unfortunately it makes Woody's character all the more 2 dimensional and pointless.This is effectively a kids film with some juicy adult stuff thrown in. Considering the average 12 year old is pretty familiar with carnage via their games console I think many 12 year olds would find this a bit lame. With all that and the cringey CGI, it wasn't Woody's finest hour - and a half.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

It's more or less the same with a larger emphasis on being funny and failing pretty miserably at it. These are dark characters, especially carnage, and they NEED a rated R tone. Instead they lean into making it more family friendly oriented so they can get a PG-13 rating and make more money. The design of Carnage was amazing and Woody does a great job as Cassidy but there is very minimal character building with him and especially his pointless girlfriend/wife(?) that serves no real purpose other than being able to Make sounds that bother the symbiotes.

396,StarWh0res,Super Fun Fast Pace Flick that Absolutely Aims to Have Fun,8,1 October 2021,"This movie is not the Godfather, Schindler's List, or Gone With the Wind, but it KNOWS it's ridiculous, fun, and it ran with that for its rather short screentime. However, honestly, it worked in a way it wouldn't of this movie thought it was a masterpiece of writing.It strived to bring up a fun ""post breakup"" story of not only Anne and Eddie but also Eddie and Venom. The parallels were obviously and the movie even poked a lot of fun at them too.Carnage was well acted out, in a believable but almost chilling way. He is not quite the Carnage he is in the comics in this PG-13 film, but the movie does a lot of little filming tricks (and even pushing what a PG-13 rating is) to give us a more adult and evil portrayal.I have seen reviews dissing it for it's rather weird portrayal of Eddie and Venom's odd relationship, but it's pretty comic accurate. It feels more as of a lot of the reviews wanted this to take itself seriously and avoid accurately portraying the more oddball parts of comic. It was nice for a modern Superhero movie to let itself go to those moments that generally get scrapped or changed to feel more real and less zany.I have mixed feelings on the Venom drawing sceneand also the ending before the post credit. Despite mentioning liking the more oddball and less realistic moments, the drawing scene divided me on that. I don't know if it was the editing to show it or what. I still laughed but unsure how I ultimately felt. The very ending makes sense, but did sort of rehash the ending of the Incredible Hulk in a less well done way. Basically Eddie and Venom takes a vacation away from his life (to determine what they'll do next), but it was almost so sudden, even with discussed early in the film. Still also made me laugh, but still also divided me with how it was done.As for favorites, love the first spoken inclusion of MUTANTS in the last movie I expected to do so. Actually grew to love Dan (the love rival, in a way) by the end, Mrs. Chan was another surprising and fun character with the zaniest Venom scene in the movie, and the post credit scene had me audible squealing (along with the entire theater!).Basically, this was a very fun, chilling, and entertaining one-shot of a story in the (MCU!!!) bigger more connected universe, with an ending that directly leads us into the next movie.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

398,katiesalbrux,I'm so disappointed!,5,16 October 2021,"The first movie was lacking, but it had some great moments and good puns - this one just made me honestly uncomfortable.The whole plot felt rushed and weird, the character development - hah! - even more. The first Venom movie was based on Venom's and Eddie's understanding, their reluctant partnership, which eventually became something approaching true friendship - remember, Venom stayed with Eddie because he liked him, then proceeded to save him at the cost of his own life (well, almost). Now we got from that to an abusive, uncomfortable, hostile relationship, where Venom beats up Eddie like a bad husband, hurts him emotionally and verbally, too.... Why?The whole ""Venom is out there partying and moping"" sequence was so, so cringy, I wanted to get up and walk out, which happened only once with a Marvel-associated movie. It was unnecessarily long for me, and in the end, didn't even have a purpose: Eddie had to apologise to Venom (why? For saying bad things?) which is victim-blaming on a brand new level.And on the supporting characters, Annie was okay, but Dan - who was surprisingly nice and supportive in the first movie - became the annoying, whining boyfriend you can't like.Carnage was unexplained, and the screaming lady? She was a weird plot device, I can't even remember her name.The only saving point was the credit scene, at least that made me happy. (like, a lot!)
I understand if some people liked this movie, but for me - and I didn't even have high expectations! - it was such a letdown. (Even though it seemed sometimes like certain moments were based on fanfictions, which is fan-service on it's finest, but that just made it more confusing and sad.)",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
399,Ashen65,MASTERPIECE,10,15 October 2021,"I have got nothing to say less than AMAZINGeverything is this movie is Perfect and I mean it. Some people liked it because it's funny-goof. No! I love it because it is so strong and phenomenal.Cletus Kasady has a reason to hate Eddie, he has a character's features and personality with a weird brain. Woody Harrelson either didn't have enough screen time, or didn't do that appealing acting, but he definitely fits his role.The Arcs were better, felt like a Venom movie more than the first one. The fight between Venom & Riot seemed stronger while Venom & Carnage was more satisfying since I was so excited for it and they didn't disappoint me.I like The Dialogues between Venom and Eddie. If you want to take their disputation as comedy or real, both ways worked good with me.Speaking of Comedy, This film is hilarious. A lot funnier than the first. Venom alone was so funny, mixing it with Tom Hardy's natural funny acting will bring you the best combo.Direction & Visual Effects are certainly better than before. Haven't added too much light nor too much osts. The scene Venom stretching out of Eddie's body went so cool.The Best thing in this movie is definitely without a doubt is Carnage. I cannot describe how much I loved the movie only by watching Carnage alone. I can't tell how much I loved the trailers only because Carnage is in them. His Design is perfect and more intimidating than both Venom and Riot. His Design, his voice, his character, his abilities. Every single scene includes Carnage was intense and surely stole all the compliments.This is exactly how I wished a VENOM franchise to be. They never failed to excite me and couldn't move my eyes off the screen. Thank you so much Sony for making this Masterpiece of a work.

402,JasonDrake8,Carnage but not really,5,22 October 2021,"I get that the first film made over 800 million on a PG-13 rating, but how can you have a character like Carnage, who has some of the most violent and graphic stories, watered down to a PG-13 movie? Especially in an age of Deadpool and Logan being very profitable. I did like it a lot more than the first movie but still....",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
403,charathechicken,Pleasant to watch,9,24 October 2021,"Went to watch this in the cinema with my mom, we were both satisfied, although my mom's personal takes were that the movie could use a tad more of the 'marvel humor.' Fair enough. I personally found Woody Harrelson's acting thrilling as always. He was a villain that you loved while hating. Absolutely great design and acting, just good enough to root even more for Eddie and his alien parasite, and of course their marriage problems.Whether or not this passes the first one is entirely up to one's own opinions. I found they both had great charm.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Excellent CGI though.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

It was ok but it did feel off at times. Really enjoyed Carnage but he was given very little screen time and I feel like he could've been used for future storylines such as Spidey and Venom teaming up but nope, 1 and done.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
410,geminiwish,Superb,10,8 October 2021,"Even better than the first one, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat! I really like the way how they introduced carnage and how he immediately goes on a rampage right after being born. C. K's intamate love with Shriek is one one of my fav parts. People complain and say Cletus was being a simp but shriek is basically the only thing Cletus cares about in this world if there's only one thing you like in the entire world you would love it just as much as him. 9.5 outa ten for me.

416,dbagleyagent,Bad ending great graphics and fight scenes,2,12 October 2021,I was frustrated with the ending. I can't believe Venom just eats carnage at the end. In the comic book Carnage almost takes over the world and it takes Spider-Man and Venom to save the world from destruction. Venom can't beat carnage alone to beat carnage according to the comic book it takes two to send him off back into space.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

420,wattschristian-08705,It Was An Enjoyable Ride But Was Flawed!,6,30 October 2021,"So this movie was quite the journey! We enjoyed the first Venom movie and when we saw a sequel was coming out for it, we were underwhelmed because of the trailers. It seemed like it was going to be a disaster. But we were proved wrong, this movie actually was a fun time. The actors in this movie made things a lot more enjoyable. Tom Hardy, you always got to love this guy, he's a great actor and pulls off Venom's voice very well. Woody Harrelson looked like he was having a lot of fun playing as Cletus and his voice for Carnage was spine chilling. This movie was fun but we have to point out a lot of problems with this movie. The writing is kinda choppy and the script was cringy and at some points, out of place. They also changed up Dan's character completely! In the first movie, he was extremely kind and likable. But in this one, he's a giant dick and is just an inconvenience to the story. Even the movie takes notice to how pointless he is in this movie. The CGI was decent and Venom's CGI kind of got a downgrade from the last one. But Carnage's CGI was pretty decent. But a lot of the bad things canceled out the good things, nods to the comic books and stuff ripped straight out of them. And that end credits scene, you'll just have to watch it for yourself.This movie was extremely fun to watch and was quite the adventure. It has its flaws and can be kind of stupid at some points but if you're a big Marvel fan, you'll enjoy it either way.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
421,andruasito,Incoherent amd lazy,1,8 October 2021,"I had very low expectations for this film, still it managed to underwelm me.

425,jetrefan679,Mediocre at best,4,3 October 2021,"This movie has all the same issues the first one does and more. Poor plot development, very pieced together feeling, not enough time spent on the story and too much time trying to land poorly placed jokes and lines and the villian (who I love in the comics) was another side act like in the first venom. Overall Sony continues to disappoint with this franchise and I truly went in with open expectations they could have easily won me over with a half decent storyline.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
426,marianos,Ridiculous,2,24 October 2021,"Absolutely zero character build-up , zero script, super predictable, boring and totally ridiculous. The movie felt that it was on a hurry, with forced and super convenient circumstances. Screentime was really short so I don't know which one to blame, the producers or the director.It seems that their only target was to deliver some cheesy jokes. It was a huge mess -- I really feel sorry for Woody Harelson who I honestly think he could play a terrific Cletous Cassidy if anyone cared to write a decent script.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

428,powerfullmutant,I loved it.,8,1 October 2021,It was epic. The most epic film of 1h30 mins. The script wasn't too serious but damn Tom Hardy killed it as Eddie again. There's so many jokes that worked and made me laugh. This is much better than the childish humor in the MCU. Sony ate that. Of course critics hated it. They hate everything. Dont trust critics. Ask a friend. Ask a fan. Or go see it yourself. Don't pay attention to the haters. I WANNA SEE IT AGAIN.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

But this film well, I enjoyed the banter between Eddie and venom more and who carnage looked but that's it. They broke almost every bit of lore and ability that carnage had which made 0 sense and failed to set up what could of been a awesome third film. The whole film just kept jumping about from scene to scene and nothing in-between just things happening and no reason why. On a whole even tho this film has been delayed they still didn't change anything and felt like it was just an hour and a half of set up for the end credits.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

434,mephisto2424,"It was also surprisingly not bloody, despite the violence.",7,2 October 2021,"It was also surprisingly not bloody, despite the violence. It was much better than the first movie.What disappointed me was the action, or the lack of. From the title and name, well you'd expect Carnage to be chaotic and destructive especially considering he was attached to an already violent psycho unlike venom, and he was but everything felt held back. The story is very short and doesn't really give any characters any depth. Carnage looked and sounded terrifying! The first scream of carnage definitely startled me not gonna lie.When we came out the cinema, I could hear everyone talking more about the post credit scenes and its implications than the actual movie for the most part. Great visuals though.All in all, I think it's a good movie, most definitely worth a watch but it just felt like they didn't let everything out the bag. It's a really fun and funny movie, just needed a little more chaos.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
435,swannwolff,Visual effects don't compensate for a hollow story,6,20 October 2021,"Even though it is watchable it feels like a hollow movie. The actors are there but don't seem to care. The director obviously didn't care either. And the script, well, it's a void. A movie should grip at your emotions, how can this happen if we don't care for any character? Who are we rooting for?Sound harms venom we got it, why repeat it so many times? The audience isn't that dumb. Throughout the movie information repeats itself a few times to make sure the viewer gets it and it isn't subtle at all.The VFX are better than in the first one. There are some enjoyable moments of course. The cinematography is nice.Overall, a movie you wouldn't remember in a year.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
436,cwjennings84,Mediocre,5,3 October 2021,"Story was kind of lazy. No back story between the two main characters.

439,woofinstien-43254,"Venom: Let there be (messy, and loud) Carnage.",6,2 October 2021,"Ok one thing, is this better than the first one? Yes.Is it way better? Not really, no.The film has a very mediocre and simple story, the backstory of Cleatus and Shriek shows enough for us to understand the twos relationship but other than that, the two are very underwhelming in this film.The action also felt very mediocre, it was total mayhem (not in a good way). Carnage throwing things and people around like a 4 year old playing with Legos. Can't really see much of what's going on, the kills could have been a bit more brutal, even with the PG-13 rating in mind, keeping the action small and personal rather than large and loud. However the action at the end of the film was exciting compared to the rest of the film.Venom doesn't do much in the film actionwise, you don't see him fighting bad guys that often (until the end), but he still remained the highlight of the film, especially him and Eddie's relationship and the difficulty of two minds in one body.The film feels rushed in some places. Jumping from scene to scene and shot to shot, not letting the viewer savour or process the information told in the scene. The direction also feels very simple, there's not much attempt at creating suspense and fear in the film except 2-3 scenes.The writing as well is very simple. Silly and kiddish dialogue like ""I'm going to eat ur face off"" makes you laugh instead of cringe. Woody Harrelson had the potential of being a great carnage, but the writing didn't support it, making Cleatus a poet in the film and saying random things in the film. The same points follow with Naomi Harris as Shriek. Tom Hardy still does a stellar, and even better job of playing as Eddie and Venom.At the end, the film feels very forgetful, nothing very memorable from the film compared to venom 1. If you really enjoyed the silliness, the comedy, and the mayhem of the first film, this one is for you. If you enjoy the darker themes of venom, and are hoping for a more brutal and darker take on the character, don't expect too much of that. If you didn't enjoy the first movie, skip on this one.But don't forget, what is potentially, one of the most mindblowing post credit scenes, which had to make me bump the score of the film from a 5 to a 6.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
440,mueidaurnib,Better than the previous one.,7,6 October 2021,"It's was much better and more fun to see than the previous one. The story was good, on point, less waste of time. Heads of to Andy Serkis for that. But sometimes it felt like we could have seen more, discovered more. Tom Hardy again shined as Eddie Brock. Eddie and Venom's duo was fun to see, in one word amazing. But the Carnage wasn't much developed, could have seen more of him. Other cast members were good too. The Shriek and Cletus love story was amazing. And finally the post-credit scene, it was the best, it will blow your mind.

If only he'd had a hand in writing it - that would have elevated the comedy horror element which is that man's forte. I guess it would have been too clever to be a Marvel film then though...I feel like Tom's brought some Brits along for the ride and I'm here for that. Even if their American accents are trying. I agree with the rating though.

It's not some deep thought cinema masterpiece and it doesn't try to be its a fun and goofy movie. A lot of people are angry over how it handled some things from the comics but honestly I'm glad it is pretty different from them if I wanted a true to blue comic viewing I'd read the comic books these movies give a fresh ,fun and lovable version of venom. If you plan on watching this be ready for a goofball of a movie don't expect to ponder life after watching it.

448,chills247,Where was the carnage? I think I missed it.,5,2 October 2021,"The pros:The 3D was awesome there were actually quite a few pop out effects.The animation looked really good.The cons:Everything elseCarnage us a weak villain. I didn't read the comics but he mostly just oscillated between making vague cryptic comments and whining about his childhood. You know what no film needs ever? A psycho killer whining about how he is the real victim somehow, unless your trying for a laugh even then it's a pretty mediocre joke at best. His character is not in anyway elevated by Woody Harrelson who is older than dirt and was given nothing to work with. He actually says ""Let there be carnage"" in the film which is not only predictable and idiotic but highly inaccurate. There was no carnage in this film... like anywhere. I doubt more than like 3 or 4 people even died. Woody Harrelson has, in my opinion, officially crossed that Tom Hanks line of appearing in so many things it's more irritating to see him cast in yet another movie than it is entertaining.Venom lost his edge. He is not even the PG-13 level of intimidating he was in the first one. He seems more like a neutered puppy than a powerful alien. He's just a mildly destructive, easily cowed, people pleaser. He's a built in assistant that Eddy treats like a nuisance. I think Sony needs to give Venom his balls back.The plot. Carnage wasn't the only thing lacking. We also get another psycho mutant X-men love story gone wrong. Underwhelming from start to finish. Even the battle between Carnage and Venom was a one and done. They could have squeezed in some more fight scenes because all this film boils down to is a good 3D animated fight scene and a decent 3D animated chase scene with some awesome pop out effects.I really enjoyed the first film but this is like ""Iron Man 2"" all over again.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

If you're in it for the fun of it, this movie is a blast, and it was thrilling to finally see a live-action Carnage.As long as it's not taken it too seriously, the film is a fun, silly, and not to mention, violent experience to be enjoyed by many.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Most of the CGI looks decent, but some scenes look really weird, like almost Ghost Rider (2007) level bad, when Carnage is jumping around fast. When he walks it looks better.I'm not even sure why i was expecting better movie, because first Venom wasn't anything special either, but in first Movie, Venom CGI at least looked very good.Overall i'm still glad that they made this movie and that there's finally live-action version of one of the most evil Spider-Man villains, best part of whole movie was end-credit scene.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

It's one of those movies that is obviously made just to entertain. Not to get a super amazing reviews or awards. But if I had to lean on one side of either good or bad, I'd say this movie is more good than bad.My one big problem with this film is its runtime. This movie is nowhere near long enough to be fully satisfying. This movie had a lot going for it, the big thing being Carnage's live action debut, but its runtime is bugging me. Only 90 minutes? For a movie like this?It really feels like a lot was cut out when watching this movie. Like there were so many scenes that could've easily been in two but were mushed together to reduce the runtime. Any kind of subplot was extremely subtle and very quickly lead right back into the main plot.Other than that, this movie mostly surprised me with how entertaining it was. 8/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Main thing I didn't like is that carnage and kletus are seperate entities like Eddie and his symbiote, but the thing in the comics about carnage that was cool was that the symbiote bonded to him so fully that they were a singular entity and even used ""I"" rather than ""we"".",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

462,sway1998,Venom:Let There Be Terrible and Nonsensical,4,2 October 2021,Tom Hardy is wasting his talent with this crappy franchise that's for sure. He collects his paychecks at the same time so what do I know. Venom and Carnage deserves better than this. Sony is trying so hard to build their own Spider-Man(less) cinematic universe yet lacks solid leadership and writing(I didn't even know Tom Hardy get his first writer credit with this movie. That explains a lot for the overall script problems)If this was a comedy flick it might not disappoint.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Honestly too much plot elements and way too many characters mixing stuff up also a very mediocre plot progression..I think they ruined Cletus' character by giving him sympathy for a woman that can blast soundwaves( seriously??? ), The CGI action scenes were not enough in my opinion, you robbed a character that kills people the blood he is owed (ironically).

It felt rushed, no real story line or plot and overly corney. Stop trying so hard.This story and character development is an absolute disgrace to Venom. A top 5 villain turned into a blundering imbecile. Sony needs to sell these rights over to Marvel Studios and let them take the reigns. I did not care for the first venom, however let their be carnage made the first one look like Schindler's list!Please for the love of god do not bring this pathetic franchise into the MCU. It is so obvious that Sony is forcing the MCU's hand to cross them over. If I was Tom Holland I would be furious and beg them to scrap it and start over.

In terms of dialog it really is as simple and effortless as possible, though it is able to achieve a few laughs and chuckles here and there.""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is not a great film, nor does it try to be, it is a mildly entertaining movie, that goes by extremely fast, with a cool looking, big ending fight and a pointless unexciting story.5/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

I really enjoyed the sequel it is most definitely worth the watch and as sequels go very good. The upsides I loved the cast chemistry I liked the characters and venom really is so funny. The whole cinema was really laughing along to his witty comments and one liners. Negatives the big fight scene was a little too violent for my taste I don't think kids can/should watch this one which is a shame as everything before and after they'd love.

It had a EPIC final battle scene in the first movie the final battle scene was horrible and had no plot. However, during the film I was waiting for Toxin to head butt his way into the movie but that never happened until the end of the movie Stephen mulligan's eyes changed Grey the color of toxin. In the post credit scene how it showed Spider-Man was dope. The music was terrific! And carnage's vocabulary was entirely different from venom's witch was awesome! Surely the best marvel movie ever!

The action is nearly flawless; every action scene is really clear, except the extremely brutal actions, to keep the PG-13 rating, but most of the violence is clear and they really push the limits of PG-13. The story, while not perfect, is still infinitely better than the story presented in the first one. There are some characters that don't get proper development, and some rushed elements because the film is only 97 minutes, but it's still a perfect popcorn film, and is definitely acceptable for a $5 Tuesday movie night.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

All im going to say is, get drunk with your friends and watch this movie and you will have a great time.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
488,sjhunt-50458,"A good sequel, but too short",7,16 October 2021,"Venom (2018) was a hugely conflicting film between fans and critics; many people really enjoyed it and many disliked the film, fortunately I am one of those who really liked it, so I was excited to watch the sequel, especially knowing that Carnage (one of the most beloved Marvel villains to ever be written) was in it.First of all, I really enjoyed Eddie and Venom's dynamic in this film, which is great as it was one of my favourite things about the original; so those of you who may not have enjoyed Venom (2018) but liked the dynamic between the two characters, you may be satisfied with the sequel too. I also thought that the film displayed Tom Hardy's acting much more in this film. I wasn't originally hugely amazed by his performance and accent in the original but this film sold me on him more, which is great as I am incredibly fond of Hardy in his other roles such as Max in Fury Road (2015) and Alfie Solomons in Peaky Blinders (2013-), and also as a person in general. And I think that the CGI has improved since the first; I never had a huge problem with it in the first film, other than a few shots being off, but I couldn't find anything wrong with it in this movie. Woody Harrelson also is of course great as Cletus Kassidy, he is one of the funniest and coolest actors about today. One thing I'd like to add is that it's very consciously silly at times, more than the first I'd say. So if you didn't mind the goofiness of the original, then you won't have a problem with this one. But it won't be for everyone.However, my main complaint is that I thought it was way too short. I didn't think it was enough to fully dive deep into finding a connection with the characters of Carnage and Shriek. Like I previously mentioned, Harrelson performs greatly and so does Naomie Harris for that matter (who plays Shriek), but the film is too short to appreciate them enough. I wouldn't go as far as saying that Carnage was underwhelming; I thoroughly enjoyed some action scenes involving him, but we didn't get enough time with him to appreciate him enough. I wasn't expecting the next Thanos, but I did want more.My final thing, is the mid credit scene. You MUST stay for it, definitely one of the coolest mid credit scenes we've ever seen in a comic book movie. It will for sure get you excited for future appearances of Venom.Overall, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is good comic-book movie worth seeing especially if you enjoy the first film and Marvel in general. You can definitely tell Andy Serkis is involved with this one, as it's very goofy at times and silly, but it can be quite dark and creepy at times. Just the main thing holding it back from being better from the first is the short runtime. But I very much enjoyed my time in the cinema watching this one.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
489,y2bbelsh,A complete mess of disappointment,2,9 November 2021,"After seeing the run time for this and the parental rating I wasn't filled with confidence. After watching it I actually underestimated how much of a disappointment it was. The film is a mess in my opinion. Each scene is rushed mixed with other scenes that don't actually make any sense. The film feels very rushed, just trying to get to the end as quickly as possible for that post credits scene. The acting is not great, the script is not poor, a major step backwards from what the first film accomplished. Often with some films you see all the best parts within the trailers, this is the case with Venom LTBC, some bits aren't even in the film or have been changed slightly. Overall, for me, I was very disappointed with this film. I can't even imagine watching it every again.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
490,DrAtelectasis,"If you liked the first, you'll HATE this one",3,2 October 2021,"Anyone who likes this has obviously never read a comic book with Carnage. Maximum Carnage was such an amazing series that I was anticipating a set up for it. This film was just way too goofy and silly. The back and forth banter between Venom and Brock was just too much. It was fine initially, but it simply got out of hand. Not to mention that the plot didn't do the characters justice. Shriek is supposed to be a very formidable foe as well as Carnage but it was lackluster. They ended up killing both characters (but I'm hoping the multiverse will bring them back). I loved the first one and there was a perfect balance of dark, grittiness and humor. This film seemed to want to pander to young audiences rather than the adults who grew up with these comics and video games. It's extremely slow without any Venom action scenes apart from the ending fight scene which isn't even as entertaining as one would hope. Instead, we have him hanging around at a night club. It's no wonder they delayed the release and trailer for so long. And yes, the worst thing, is that this film should have been rated R. As stated earlier, I loved the first but this severely disappointed me. The best part was the 3 minute mid credit scene. Other than that, I would not recommend anyone to see it.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

500,henrygranqvist,"Exploiting fan favorite Marvel characters, and not giving a **** about what you actually produce",1,26 October 2021,"Hmm, what can I say - In short, Andy Serkis should definitely not be allowed to direct movies, and the screen writers for this movie (incl. Tom Hardy) should definitely never be allowed to write any more scripts.Let's start with the positives; Both Venom and Carnage looked amazing, the fights looked amazing as well, and the transformation from human to symbiote looked seriously cool. In addition, I find Venoms voice to be exactly as it should be. Venom is now a comedian, he threw about 300 jokes throughout the movie, of which maybe 10 where pretty funny in my opinion. That's it, heads up to the crew in-charge of animations / special effects.The negatives;Plot: I honestly thought about what to write about the plot for about 30mins before posting this, but it was honestly so thin that I'm not sure if I even got it.Basically, Venom / Brock is just walking around town when the serial killer Cletus Cassidy wants to meet Brock. Brock agrees, Venom notices a drawing, Cassidys victims are found and Cletus is sentenced to death, Brock is again considered a good journalist, but Cassidy bites Brock/Venom, so he becomes Carnage. Cassidy is in love, so he saves this weirdo, kills a few people, wants to kill Brock, Carnage wants to kill Venom, weird girl wants to kill a police officer. Weird girl and Cassidy wants to get married. They fail, end of movie.Why does Cassidy want to see Brock, who knows... ""he likes him"" is what we get. Why does Carnage want to kill Venom... ""Because"". Who is the weird girl Cassidy is in love with, what was she sentenced for, why does she have super powers, how did she survive the leathal shot from the police officer? Who knows, the movie doesn't even bother to try to explain this one. What are Carnages and/or Cassidys motives for anything? No idea, I guess they don't have any, and I guess everyone that bites Venom becomes a symbiote... Venom says ""s***, it's a red one"" at one point (referring to Carnage), what does that mean, are there different kind of symbiotes? Why are some of them red and more dangerous, why does Venom's ""child"" become red? Who knows...Venom and Brock get angry at each other and separates for a short while, then reunites... Not too exciting, as the same plot development has been used numerous times before, just in other comic book based movies alone....All characters are completely one dimensional and boring, there is waaaay too much effort at comedy in a Venom movie (most of it not delivering), the dialogue is laughably bad... In short, you feel as if the budget was spent on the special effects team, after which Sony said ""whatever, let's hire a few 10-year-olds for the rest""Personally, I think this has been the first really bad year for Marvel movies since 08, both MCU and other (like this one), but - all of these other misfires are honestly masterpieces in comparison to this garbage. I really wish I hadn't gone to see this movie, I could just have watched the trailer at home to see the cool special effects instead.Lastly, as a comic book fan I'm really sad to see Sony butchering the Venom character... Venom is one of Spider-Mans scariest enemies, as he gets under Peters skin, tortures him mentally as he knows his identity, and physically as Spider-Man is in serious trouble against the physically superior Venom... Venom has sometimes also occassionally been on the good side, I don't mind that, that's why he is a loveable anti-hero, but in this movie he is just an idiot that eats chickens, cooks food, and jokes (more than Deadpool, which is saying something).Which brings me to my last point, which is that I think Sony just saw the Deadpool movies, and went ""that's what we want"". The problem is, that style works for Deadpool, but not for Venom, and that's what happens when no-one making this movie is a genuine comic book fan, which in turn means that no-one truly understands the character ""Venom"" (Nor Carnage). Sony is just trying to make money by exploiting characters they know that fans have been dying to see on-screen for a looong time, characters that are so popular that fans will pay to see this movie even if it's absolutely horrible and pointless.... And that's the truth behind the ""Venom franchise"", and the other Marvel movies Sony is soon releasing, and plans to release in the future...Dear Marvel/Disney, please save the spiderverse from Sony.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

512,jordanpercy,"Flawed, but loved it nonetheless",9,26 October 2021,"This movie takes everything I loved from the first Venom and doubled down, showing more of Eddie and Venom's relationship, not taking it very seriously, which is something I love. I personally believe that with most superhero stories there's an element of goofiness, and this movie just leaned into it and had fun with it! (You could tell Tom Hardy was loving every second of it.)Cletus Cassidy (Carnage specifically) wasn't a very good villain, I don't like most portrayals of the character as I find it to be edgy for the sake of being edgy but even still he was far better than I had expected, the twisted love between Cletus and Shriek was also done quite well.If I was viewing this from a critical point of view I would probably give the movie a 7/10 but I just love the dynamic between Eddie and Venom, and some of the jokes genuinely made me laugh, not like in the first movie where I was laughing at the jokes because of how stupid they were most of the time, this was genuinely funny at times. I would DEFINITELY recommend watching this movie, regardless of whether you've watched the first movie or not, in all truth, it doesn't affect the story that much at all, this movie also works as a stand alone movie. I love this movie and am definitely going to watch it again at some point, solid 9/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Very low budget film, you can clearly see that it is a covid19 creation. Could have been much better and beaten all previous marvel movies as the choice of main character was successful and also the choice of the evil villain.

Tom Hardy's character kept talking/saying type of lisp/voice that I heard once or twice in the first movie but seemed to come out A LOT more in this one. Became bothersome and again seemed like they were trying to push it.. whatever IT is.The comedy bits in the first one worked for me.. they weren't overly pushed and again goofy.

Seeing him on the big screen felt like a full circle moment. I REALLY enjoyed the transformation into carnage scene. Apart from this, nothing really happens. Didn't give an eff about the side characters. Should have been 2 hours long with venom and carnage having a couple smaller fight scenes throughout, building up to an epic finish. The 90 min runtime just isn't cutting it. Also, felt like it could've been darker? Imagine they went full horror. Would enjoy a little less of jokes and more brutality - it is carnage after all!I feel like they have captured Venom's essence perfectly. His comedy is the best, he looks amazing, etc. The ""lethal protector"" lines gave me chills. As a movie, it was okay.

When they announced the second chapter I was very excited only for the presence of Carnege, already from the trailer I noticed a lack of care in the CGI but I thought that maybe they still had to work on it. Unfortunately this was not the case, the duration already made me doubt, but the dress does not make the monk. I go to the cinema without any expectations, when I came out I was very sad. I have never seen a film worse than this, the dialogue is nonsense, the action scenes are incomprehensible and I was really disappointed with the scene after the credits. Not to mention Carnage, very badly done and meaningless. Finally I can only say that there cannot be a film about Carnage without a small drop of blood, truly shameful.

The action scenes were too much cgi as expected but i really think Woody Harrelson wasn't as good as Riz Ahmed in the last movie and the iconic Carnage vs Venom fight we expected wasn't so ""iconic"" it was just a lower version of riot vs venom.

I wanted to see more action and more laughs for the film. I felt it should have been rated R since it would have been amazing to see the heads ripped off and I wanted it to be darker.

Sony is trying to make Venom, a once serious and dangerous character, into a PG-13 ""family friendly"" version of Deadpool. They absolutely wasted Carnage as a villain, and the character ""Shriek"" was marred with bad acting, poor development, and abused as a plot device. The post credit scene couldn't even salvage this travesty. We deserve better as an audience and until they deliver that, this will be the last Venom movie I pay to see.

The comedy is good, but it seems to care about that comedy more than it's villain: Carnage. He was so heavily underused in this film that it is absolutely insane. Shriek was dumb. All that's of note is that she can scream and she hates a police man. The final battle felt underwhelming and uncreative, though it was striking and fun to watch. I give the film props for trying to be different than other cookie cutter marvel type films, but the film has a lot to work on.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Watching Venom and Eddie Brock bond and come to terms with their co habitation deliverers a great display of acting done well, and then the inevitable carnage that unfolds throughout the movie overshadows the handful of scene's that really should have been left on the drawing board.Worth a watch and worth your money, if you enjoy action spliced with comedy and don't take it too seriously you'll love this movie.

And somehow, Venom managed to fumble the ball on all fronts. This was the only movie in my entire LIFE I have ever walked out of. It only took a good 30 minutes before I completely lost hope. The scenes for some reason feel wrong?? Almost like a collection of poor quality drawing board ideas that were FILMED before being finished. Really cringy acting and horrible jokes do a great job derailing any hope of a positive experience from this movie, which is confusing because Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson are both amazing actors. The CGI effects used for ANYTHING venom does (talking, crawling, moving around) reminds me of a PS2 cutscene. The sense of humor this movie has is virtually nonexistent, with the bad one liners and outdated references. The almost childlike arguments between Venom and Eddie made me squirm in my seat with discomfort as the theatre remained silent and nobody laughed.Save your time, money, sanity, and soul and do NOT go see this monstrosity.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

I did try giving it a chance though, found myself laughing at times and being intrigued by Carnages breakout scene but overall it was poorly made and poorly written. Felt rushed and with a runtime of only 1 hr 30 mins, you could tell the movie speeding through scenes with potential.

560,robstubbz,Tom Hardy is the only survivor of this train wreck,4,24 October 2021,"What happens when you let a writer, whose only notable past project is 50 Shades of Grey, write a comic book movie? Venom: Let There Be Carnage happens.The writing in this was absolutely horrific. Nothing about the origin of Venom, Carnage or the symbiotes is explained in any capacity. Plot holes are taped over shoddily, and the build up to Shriek's breakout makes little sense. Since when are symbiotes capable of hacking computers? And into top secret government files in about 20 seconds no less. The movie feels like it was written by a teenager; most notably when Harrelson roars the movie's title from the top of a church spire near the climax for no apparent reason. The dialogue is filled with corny one liners and zingers that never land.Stephen Graham's character was a bright point but he was given a criminally low amount of screen time. Tom Hardy's performance was great as always, and his relationship with Venom was the only decent part of the movie. It's a shame to see his talents wasted in such a bad film.

572,PotatoMeister,Bland and forgettable,3,4 October 2021,"Took my younger cousin to go see this. He's much more into the marvel universe than I am. Seems like he enjoyed it; I enjoyed eating the popcorn (at first).From what I gather, the plot follows venom/eddie, a chaotic-good anti-hero duo, as they try to lead a ""normal"" life in a not so normal world. Since marvel movies are cookie cutter, I kind of knew where this movie was headed, but after a while, it started to remind me of another movie: Inside Out.!! SPOILERS !!: Inside Out is about a young girl dealing with depression. The movie represents her emotions using personas (one for sadness, anger, happiness, etc.) which are little beings living inside her head that talk to each other. The movie uses the conversations between the emotions as a way to guide the girl's emotions (and by extension, the audience). What I liked about Inside Out was it wasn't afraid to tackle tough issues. Even though the movie was made for children, I was still able to relate to it, as a grown man, and it left an impression on me.So what does this have to do with venom? Well, venom is essentially eddie's alter ego. He serves the same purpose as an imaginary friend, being there for eddie when he's at his lowest. He's there to talk to eddie when no one else will. Mental health is an important subject, and men's mental health is often ignored. I thought, for a second, that this movie would actually go there, that eddie would actually talk about his problems and venom might help him get through it. I was about to get interested in the film...but nope.... it was back to the noise.Unfortunately, movie execs don't like taking risks and prefer falling back to the tried and tested formula of entertaining people: lots of fights, action, little talking and cliffhangers for the next run-of-the-mill film.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
573,nevil_76,"It' a Venom ""What If"" version (without to meet Spiderman), so it's OK",10,15 October 2021,"I loved this movie. I found the theme of the film appropriate: this series of events should be understood as a ""What If"", since the symbiote did not meet Spiderman, and in the comic I remember that initially the symbiote had developed a similar affection for its first host and and it was the double detachment (seen by the symbiote as treason) to generate the hatred that would have distinguished Venom.Since there is no catalyst for this hatred, this unfolding of events seemed consistent to me.I really enjoyed Hardy's performance, which throughout the film makes me see a character created in CGI as real, Harrelson also liked me a lot as Cassidy / Carnage, a little + down Naomi Harris but still valid.I conclude by saying that I found the film well balanced between humor (which in my opinion is plausible with this ""alternative"" Venom), action and violence.

Go watch it before it gets spoiled by every 9 year old kid across the country.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
577,AleximusPRimus12,This movie was ... perfection.,10,1 October 2021,".This review may contain some hints to major spoilers.Ok obviously not perfection like perfection, but it was a very good sequel to the first venom , like a very good asf sequel. If you loved the first one , most probably you're going to absolutely love this one too. Tom hardy KILLS IT with his amazing performance, Woody Harleson... jesus wow he is amazing and of course Naomie Harris who plays Shriek. Its all perfectly put out and played out... the character development also is amazing and yes character development on EACH character, like even Dan (Annie's Husband as of Let There Be Carnage).Detective Mulligan was amazing also, cant wait to see more ... wink wink.I don't know what else to say other than that it's really amazing , fun , silly and just ... mind blowing sometimes. I know some may criticize how it ended but to be honest I don't care , it was very good BUTTT to what we saw ij the post credits scene. Get ready :)
I wanna close this review by saying how good of acting tom hardy and woody harleson have .. like wow AND of course how can i forget , Carnage! He. Is. Perfect. But , he will be even more perfect after that one scene after the credits... I mean it's possible... for him to yknow.Anyways , 10/10 for me , if you like short movies which are fun , adventurous and all , then this is it for you . If i were to describe this movie in a quote , it would be ""Quality over Quantityz""",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
578,outlaw-07458,Good CGI/Action; Poor Comedy/Writing; PG13,6,3 November 2021,"The special effects, acting, and fight scenes were all great, as one would expect with this movies budget and cast.However, the lame humor between Eddie and Venom really dragged down the movie for me. Also, the writing/ending seemed a bit weak. Like they just wanted to end the movie asap. It's worth a watch but I'm definitely disappointed. I really had high hopes for this one. PG13 rating was a buzzkill for a Carnage movie.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
579,esuoyd,Dissapointing to say the least,1,17 October 2021,"I enjoyed the first film. This film however was attrocious. I considered leaving the theatre. Have all you people who enjoyed this got a bag over your head? You could see the embarrassment on Hardy's face when he said his one liners. He was clearly there just for the money. Can someone please teach the robots who make these films what humour and a plot is, because I dislike paying money and wasting time on garbage. I guess it's my own fault for having hope in Disney. Walter would be ashamed.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

581,andreaskant,Personal opinion,8,23 October 2021,"After I had read those critics in IMDB I went to the cinema prejudice and scared that I am going to see a bad movie.. HOW WRONG WAS I! The movie was pretty good with nice story great cgi and fights. Personally I came close with the character( Venom ) and I loved the jokes and the funny attitude at the atmosphere! All in all Venom is a very good movie and of course way better from the first one but if you go to the cinema expecting to see the venom from the comics just don't go you won't like it ,this movie stands alone and it has nothing to do with the comic Venom
Also pretty hyped with the post credit scene;)",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Oh yeah, and awesome mid-credit scene.It's no The Dark Knight or Justice League (Snyder Cut).

Maybe it's a good thing it didn't happen. First of all, I don't want to start without saying: ""I did not understand anything "", once the movie starts, the movie goes by until we solve the problem of where are we going. The most chaotic and excluded scenario I've seen lately; yes, excluded friends, they made my beautiful character soggy. That character you love so much is garbage. Even the master Tom Hardy couldn't change the atmosphere of the movie, the scene was already between existence and non-existent, so maybe there is... It's a seriously bad movie where you can create time passages to see if that's all. My score is 10/4.2 due to the cast and the existential situation of the character.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

591,ashcraftkarac,Sitting in the Parking Lot,3,6 October 2021,"This movie was so terrible, I am literally sitting in the parking lot of the theater writing this review. I enjoyed the first movie, I would give it a solid 6/10, it was entertaining but Venmo 2 made Venmo 1 look like a masterpiece! It was so horribly bad I don't know where to start. First the writing feels like it has schizophrenia, it's all over the place! It's like two writers sat in different rooms, and came up with two very different movies and then both were so horrible they decided to smash both of them together, hoping two negatives would make a positive! It did not work. The only redeeming quality from this movie was Hardy and the effects, Venmo really did look spectacular. The end fight was uneventful, the romance embarrassingly awkward, and the plot forced. Would the movie have been better if it was rated R, probably but not by much, I also don't understand why they only made it 1 hour and 37 minutes long... adding another 25 or 30 minutes would have made an impact but I am not sure how you would have saved this dumpster fire! Definitely a disappointment.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
592,sanchezdelarubiapablo,THE MORE THE BETTER: YUMMY!!!!!!!!,10,19 October 2021,"The awaited Serkis movie with the savage Carnage presentation goes beyond expectations. You will enjoy double this one if you are a fan of the characters from the books and the saga.The easy story by Kelly Marcel works just great because the movie doesn't need to focus on that. Venom never was an elaborated story, but a nasty and master characterization exercise of really interesting, derranged and disfunctional minds and characters. The movie has a sense of horror when dealing with Cletus and Carnage like in the comics, and also a great sense of twisted humor when dealing with Venom. I just felt like I was watching 3Dimensional Venom VS Carnage comic book!Hardy explains his character perfectly: coward Brock and daring Venom makes that funny contrast that defines the anti hero: Brock doesn't need to be a hero and Venom needs to be fed with brainy heroism. In the other hand you have Cletus and Carnage disfunctional union: they go in the same direction until the last revelations. Also you have a nice secondary in Dan and Anne and a perfect love interest for Cletus brought to life by the great Namoie who portrays Shriek with total accuracy.I like to define this movie as a gloomy, sinister and macabre feast, that is delivered with good taste, and makes you enjoy from the beginning to the end.When something is good you never get too much, and the necessity of more and more Venom and Carnage confirms this is an awesome movie to be enjoyed over and over again.Just hope they go with Maximum Carnage epic saga. Fingers crossed!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
593,guillermodilucamc,You either please the audience or stick to the actual genre,6,13 October 2021,"The sequel to the first Venom movie would be disappointing, mostly because the first movie set a mood, this mood was drama, something dar and mysterious. This movie completely flips the genre and makes it a comedy, it has a couple of good jokes but in the end, that's not Venom, if they wanted to please a bigger crowd with comedy it's fine, just don't change the original genre.Now I know I do not want to watch Venom 3 in case there ever is such a thing.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
594,agdragon-76504,Absolutely fantastic,10,10 October 2021,"I genuinely wish more marvel adaptations were filmed/written in this style. In a lot of ways that I can't quite express it reminded me of watching the Toby Maguire spiderman movies for the first time. Something about it is just so genuinely enjoyable, big monster fights, fun banter, overall more mature theme, concise storyline that doesn't require 6 other movies worth of context to fully understand. What more can I say? Me see anti-hero monster movie, movie make me happy and go ""WOAHHHHH"" and ""hahaha"", me say 10/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
595,huzysabis,Oh how can i wait for spiderman 3??,8,15 October 2021,"WARNING SPOLIERS!!!!!!!To begin with this sequence is far better than the 1st one, Carnage has far more screen time than riot and a much better antagonist (obviously) I still don't understand why they had riot in the first movie rather than riot. As Venom's arch nemesis carnage is far more impactful than Riot. Secondly, the relationship of Venom and Eddie is absolutely stunning in this one. The first Venom displays Eddie having problems with Vemom living in his body but this one is the absolute opposite, with Venom having problems living by Eddie's rules and unable to eat human brains(ew) with having to live only by eating chickens and an uneven amount of chocolate Venom has had enough of Eddie and in a fit of rage decides to leave his host. Subsequently this develops more problems as Venom has a hard time choosing the perfect host like Eddie and adapting to the change with an unlikely chance of survival he slithers towards countless hosts and is dissatisfied with every one of them and approaches towards Ms Chen.. that's right the old lady also has an improved role in the movie.The tragedy of Cletus Kassady and how it morphs him into an evil mass murdering physchopath leading to the best live action antagonist Carnage is absolutely mind blowing. This is a development from the last one as Riot is not given any background info or even Drake for a change. People who haven't read comics get to understand Kassady much better and understand his issues which sets the movie tone dark and perfect for introducing Carnage.Furthermore, the post credit scene leaves fans to be asking for more as Venom is soon to be introduced in the Spiderverse in the upcoming Spiderman 3 along with the sinister 6. Lastly, Just the stunning visuals and effects have made this movie an absolute pleasure to watch. With amazing graphics and CGI and the overall design of carnage with insane voice over is just one of the many reasons I am in love with this movie and Carnage. The only reason there are 2 stars missing is due to the annoying role and introduction of 'Shriek' along with the major stepback of the duration of the movie. But you know what they say 'Quality over quantity' is the percet statement for defining this movie and i would absolutely recommend this cinematic masterpiece to be watched by along with friends and family.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

597,stubborn-86113,Symbrock been there since before the movies!!!!,9,2 October 2021,I liked Venom! Venom was everything I want in a movie...FUN!! Sure people that know what Symbrock(Veddie?) is and KNOW that it has existed before the movies are gonna enjoy the movie. If you don't like the dynamic between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and Venom...go watch Spiderman 3 cause that's the Venom that fits your headcanon or try the any Spider-Man show. There's many others interpretations and versions for you to enjoy. Tom Hardy's portrayal is COMIC ACCURATE with minus the Spider-Man origin. The dynamic is fun and loved every minute of the movie. Cletus and Carnage were AMAZING as Venom's rivals(yes i forgot the actor's name while typing this im SORRY). Shriek was GORGEOUS!!! Overall id watch it again just to get a third Venom movie.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
598,atulnayyar,Different approach yet predictable,6,1 November 2021,"Short action film which is extremely predictable. It was very much similar to the original Spider-Man sequel and one scene was taking from the amazing Spider-Man 2, although the characters and the scenery was slightly changed. Yet another film with actors who give an amazing performance yet the film lacks creativity or the WOW factor. It's possible that the prequel was extremely impressive and the pressure on this one to be better was more. After credits was very unique and amazing though.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
599,ericksuksdorf,Venom,10,2 October 2021,My view there was not a lot of carnage in it that made me mad but it was very good it was mostly about venom and edies relation ship. Th final figth sen was very cool but desapointing how he died from falling of the building.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
600,vonne81,Missed opportunity,6,22 October 2021,"I really like Venom and his interaction with Eddie. The movie should have focused more on that.When it turns out that Venom could be a real asset to Eddie's journalism career I started picturing all kinds of interesting and intelligent storylines. Unfortunately it's over in the blink of an eye. The movie continues with an unoriginal story of psychopath gets symbiot and goes on revenge trip with all the usual steps and no surprises there.This quote from the Indiewire review summs it up for me:
""There doesn't need to be carnage (or, hell, even Carnage), there just needs to be Venom, and more of it.""The mid-credit scene does give hope for the future.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Watch it for Carnage.,3,2 October 2021,"First of all, I wanna start with Carnage, after like 10+ years of wishing to see Carnage in live-action, I was finally happy to see Carnage in a movie. This movie hyped me when I saw the title carnage when it was first revealed. Then I went to the movie and. The movie was a disaster! I liked Carnage but it wasn't enough for me! Carnage was missing a lot of things. Example: His evil psycho laugh and many other crazy and psycho stuff that Carnage did in the comics. I wished to see a scarier Venom in the sequel, but Venom was more childish than the first movie. The movie is disappointing for me. All I am going to say is, I didn't like it.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
604,jakabgyongyver,I don't like it,2,27 October 2021,"The jokes were really bad. I think that the whole film was just creppy. It was too long and the little love story was creppy too.

This one doesn't really follow up with anything special. Movie instantly takes off into the story, but doesn't really accomplish much nor is there much character development. The characters are pretty vanilla; which was a disappointment as I'm a Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson fan. The venom comedy is what keeps the story good with his interactions with Tom Hardy, but aside from that it feels like you're at the end of the movie in no time realizing ""so this is it?"" The action is good and some good comedic moments, while being entertaining. I just found this forgettable and questioning why a second movie was even need here. That being said; stay for the after credits scene because its a 10/10 there!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

608,npjvquvff,Stanky,3,1 October 2021,Truly can't believe the praise this movie is getting right now. I'm a big marvel fan and not a tough critic at all. I enjoy most movies purely for entertainment value but this movie was a huge flop for me.It felt like it was made as a money grab. The plot was extremely weak and the back story was quick and confusing so you didn't feel any kind of attachment to the new characters. The dialogue was cheesy and there was only a handful of jokes that actually stuck their landing.The only saving grace imo was the visual effects and bombshell post credit scene.Very disappointed.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

The venom storyline has always been super chaotic- and the relationship between Eddie and Venom had always been somewhat romantic. They literally love each other, and have said so in comics.

611,lttetmmy,"fun, fast-paced, frantic film worth a good watch in theatres",7,3 October 2021,"Venom: let there be carnage is the 2021 sequel to the 2018 film venom starring Tom hardy (Dunkirk and the dark knight rises) and directed by Ruben fleischer (zombieland, uncharted) however this go around is being directed by famous actor Andy Serkis (lord of the rings and black panther) his work in this film brings the character of carnage to life in all of his pg-13 carnage (that did not flow well) in the best way possible. People get mad at once upon a deadpool for being censored but if they had to do it that was the best way, same with this film, it gets more hate than it deserves. Let's start with the positives, the church fight is absolutely stunning with incredible shots and fight choreography. The part where carnage extends all of his tentacles out as he leaps towards venom is absolutely amazing (but still a little forced but it isn't really being forced if it looks awesome). The film's witty humour and interesting character relationships give it a high rating in my book. Now for the negatives, it's short runtime and occasional forced scenes and jokes set this back to a 7 from what would normally be a 9, however it still makes me belive in this song marvel universe, a cinematic universe shouldn't contain just a bunch of Batman v supermans and Tom cruise the mummys to set up everything and have people wait for the good stuff (which isn't really that good) but this doesn't do that and instead strives to create a good movie (until it's end credits scene that everyone says is the best part and the only good part but they're just biased toward, haha connected universe go brrrrrrr) and I think that's what they're trying to do with morbius as well, I hope the trend continues to kraven the hunter, I was a little scared with the whole ravencroft bit but after seeing the film, not to upset, I did wish for more screentime from shriek though, anyway I'm excited for the upcoming movies in this universe and I hope this review convinced you to see it in theatres.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

Not one plot point is ever really explained, it felt like a million ideas put into 90 minutes but to make sure the blood was kid friendly. Felt more like a bad marvel movie built for a cash grab rather than another amazing venom movie.And For some reason carnage can turn into a tornado?

1stly: before thinking about killing a character off that's popular let them be in a couple movies before they get killed off or it's pointless
2ndly: why kill a famous character off this way when in comics they would regenerate from there wounds as in comics carnage can regenerate from a drop of blood

619,nxyvztxn,"Let there be Carnage, but sadly he wasn't there enough.",6,14 October 2021,"First day and the first show was all that it took for me to break my year-long expectations for Carnage but the post-credit scene makes up for it.If I want to sum up the whole review, there it is.As a Marvel Zombie myself, I was excited to see the face-off between Venom and Carnage ever since I played Spider-Man (2000). The mayhem and destruction that comics and all the animated series brings in for Carnage was unjustified for the film. I went to a theatre half-full (sadly, Covid times) with Marvel fans mostly everyone had a similar reaction as hootings and shouts at a typical first day Marvel launch was missing.The movie was a long-awaited project for MCU fans, and it did fall flat on the expectations as the film lacked character arch for one of the evilest villains in Spider-Man Universe to show how Carnage became what it was, the gore and glory of the madness he brings in. Meanwhile, Venom was shown quite soft and funny what it's not supposed to be, nonetheless, it was delightful to watch Tom Hardy play the character with its twists and turns of punches it brings in. Another thing I felt missing about Carnage was the psychotic voice it always portraited, the film felt monotone flat on it.The movie screentime was typically very short for what you expect a superhero-comic movie to be and could have gone easily longer to add more depth to it. I believe they could have made it more gore like how Deadpool and Logan are but surely the box-office mattered much more to the producers.The only thing that got me excited to jump off my seat was the post-credit scene. Boy O Boy! It was worth it all for that moment. Excited to see what Marvel got in the bag for future projects.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

622,sntmkdxd,"Too short...way, way to short for how much was going on.",3,3 October 2021,"I was a huge fan of the first Venom movie. I loved it. I had extremely high hopes for this one and I was so disappointed. Venom was hard to understand at many points in the film. The movie was also extremely rushed. There was no time to develop the characters or your connection to them. There was so much potential and I feel like I could have been great if it was 20-30 minutes longer and there was more time to let the story develop. The first venom was almost 2 hours long. This one from beginning to credits was around 80 minutes. Too short for how much was going on. I hate giving low ratings but I was so disappointed. Honestly the best part of the whole movie happened during the end credits. The acting was alright. Woody Harrelson was excellent and really one of the only redeeming factors in this movie. I know It is a ""super hero"" movie and they are predictable, but this was beyond predictable. Within the first 5 minutes of this film, combined with knowledge from the trailer, I knew exactly what was going to happen in the movie. I hate being disappointed. Especially when the first one was so good in my opinion.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
623,nicholasmartin-26635,Mediocre at best..bad editing..terrible cgi,4,1 October 2021,The first reviews posted on here must have been people associated with the film trying to hype up this mess. All over the place and lacks any kind of heart. Needs a fresh director moving forward. CgI was worse than ghost rider. First one was waaaaay better.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
624,omhawkins-97310,Three combovers is just too many.,4,27 October 2021,"While the attempts by the male leads to cover up their receding hairlines at least provided some welcome comedy value, I think three may have been too far.Woody made the elegant choice to go with a simple ""bowl cut"" combover, combined with an awe-inspuring volume of make up to de-age him. Given he was playing a supposedly scary character this made sense, the genuinely terrifying hairdo more than made up for an acting performance less Cletus Kassidy and more Cletus from The Simpsons.Stephen Graham swung for the fences with an elaborately tiered combover, starting at the back of his head but combining and curling in various places to form an exquisitely layered wave effect. Perhaps this combover was intended to convey the complexity of his character? Unfortunately his written dialogue and dodgy American accent sadly let the hair's performance down a little. I think the haircut may go on to better roles, it's young so hopefully it'll recover from this film.Tom Hardy, who I've loved in most films he's been in and who seems like a genuinely lovely man, sported a wet look comb-forward. A subtle effort in keeping with a man who has turned in some gloriously nuanced performances over the years. I'm not sure I would have noticed it had he not been acting alongside such glaring crimes against both growing old gracefully and forehead pride.Each of these actors have featured over the years in films and TV shows close to my heart. However, to call this film utter pap is unfair on pap. Thankfully it had a very short run time during which I was able to keep entertained by focussing on how intense the conversations between the hair stylists and the continuity team must have been from scene to scene. Must have been a long shoot for both parties and they deserve praise. Are there Oscars for hairspray application?",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

643,treonuget,"Did not like the first one oh, I thought this one was fine (no spoilers review)",6,1 October 2021,"The movie has great cinematography and wonderful creative sequences. Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson are great in the movie. There's also this cop character in the movie that interacts with Tom Hardy Oh, I thought he was great in the movie and I was honestly wanting to see you more of him interacting with Tom Hardy then Tom Hardy interacting with Venom. Well the CGI is not great I thought it was well Incorporated most of the time which is a big plus from the first movie for me. I thought all the storylines we're very interesting and I thought that the Carnage portion of the movie was pretty cool for a PG-13 version of this character. But to be honest I'm sad to say that the movie is just okay. The biggest problem with the movie is the runtime oh, it is way too short. There are plenty of moments in the movie that feel like the studio took chunks out of the movie and left you with a photo real. You also never feel like anyone other than Tom Hardy and then I'm good character development which really sucks because I think the introduction lead you to believe that this movie is going to be really awesome. I feel like I'm honestly if they were to switch out all of these stories this would have been a great movie. And I can't help but Wonder did the studio come in and tell them to chop off a lot of this movie because it's very noticeable in the scenes then there was supposed to be a little bit more then what they are showing. I also feel like this movie was supposed to be rated R but the studio told them to make it PG-13 probably due to covid. I really do feel bad for the team that worked on this movie because I feel like the final product did not do justice to the movie. But to be honest at the end of the day I thought the movie was just fine.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
644,nsophia-15437,No regrets here,9,1 October 2021,"I definitely prefer this one over the first movie, not saying the first one was bad or anything. The action sequence was done very well. The jokes i found funnier and the chemistry between Eddy and Venom is always awesome but no lie I wish the movie was rated R. I feel like a character like Carnage, given how gruesome he is in the comics; deserves even more satisfying kills and the movie should've been longer... felt like alot of things happened and they needed a longer run-time to make the movie seem less cramped. Andy Serkis is a incredibly talented man and is one of my favorite actors and I know this is one of his first BIG movies he has directed ( know he's directed a few movies but nothing to this caliber) I'm hoping that he can direct the next Venom and do a even better job than he has already..

651,letticiousbae,A chaotic masterpiece,10,2 October 2021,"I completely savoured this film, the improvement in building the storyline really shows up in this film and offers a fast yet comprehensive pace. I love how they decided to keep things an absolute train wreck, surrounding Eddie with all the mess that is his life now but somehow both Venom and Eddie make it work and I'm here for it; I am completely invested in their interactions as one individual per se, the connection between them definitely was developed on a deeper level in this moment and even though the movie doesn't develops the emotional part on the level that it was expected to be developed, they gave us an intense and immersive relationship.The film doesn't needs to be perfect, by being chaotic it gives the perfect balance between characters interactions and the plot.I can proudly admit that not only myself but the fans (mainly on tumblr) absolutely loved this movie for what it is: a chaotic masterpiece and we are thankful for everyone's hard work; Andy Serkins this was just *chef kisses*And oh boy, don't let me start talking about Tom Hardy; he completely understood the assignment and gave us the sweaty, greasy and messy Eddie Brock that everyone -and I mean EVERYONE- is in love with.Venom: let there be carnage offered an exquisite, turbulent and perfectly chaotic ride that I enjoyed to the very last second.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
652,kingkindgrind,I Would Love This Movie If I Was An 8 Year Old,6,2 October 2021,"The pacing of the story felt very rushed in comparison to the previous installment.What I enjoyed:
I love the scene where Cletus broke Francis out of prison it was beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.The design of Carnage did not match up to his comic book inspiration. Despite that he looks amazing and very realistic. He looked like he was made out of canned meat instead of paying tribute to his color scheme in the comics.Carnage's abilities were very awesome! Which I genuinely liked very much.What I disliked:
The humor did not hit me at all. While the whole movie theater was laughing at scenes and lines that were ""funny"" I was not at all phased by the comedy of the movie. It gets very awkward during a lot of the scenes in the movie especially In the ones that did not have crucial points to the plot or the exposition.Perhaps I've just outgrown the ""oh they're fighting haha"" phase. But the comedy made more more confused than laugh wholeheartedly.For me, the movie could have ended better. If Cletus Kassidy and his wife Francis was given a redemption arc. It could have been possible to give them shot at proving they could change for the better and spread carnage to those who deserve it such as a potential common threat (cough cough Kang the Conqueror) and their armies. They could have been on the run as well. But no instead the movie gave us Carnage getting eaten by Venom because ""eff you"" and bite your head off. But welp they both died.Overall it's a good movie. They did deliver the character Carange we've been anticipating it just didn't seem that satisfying of a payoff and worth the wait. But that's only my opinion and where my mental space is at.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

664,bowmangarang,Great Hangover Movie,8,2 October 2021,"Similar to and as enjoyable as the first entry. It still kinda has that retro 80's-90's hero-film-vibe. They even kinda poke-fun/nod toward fan reception of this (regarding the first film). There's not much drag; the plot struts along rather fluidly. It's fast paced; You don't really have to pay attention to know what's going on. It just romps along.Woody pops up as Carnage pretty quickly and boy do they nail his character. The way he moves on screen is a real treat; the cgi did not disappoint. Screech or shriek.. shrek...eh? Yeah, eh. She was fun... but they probably could have fleshed her character out a lil' more. She seems only to exist in order for Woody to obsess over.. and vise versa? Not a huge problem.. but there just wasn't much depth there. Conversely, Eddy and Venoms relationship felt as traumatic.. but it was layered.. and that was fun. Their lil' breakup about midway through felt a lil' forced. But yeah.. same problem as Woody and shrek.. plot device. Eh, shrugs.The comedy spritzed throughout was so much fun. Venom's personality just takes over. There's a bunch of silly lil' quotable quatables. Good stuff.As everyone else has echoed... the post credit scene filled me with gleeeee. Big part of that glee comes from the fact that i realllly enjoy Venom's character & wanna see more.. this movie does a good job of making the ""Lethal Protector"" into a fan favorite.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

667,omarabuameir,VERY DISAPPOINTED,1,2 October 2021,To be honest I kinda knew this movie wasn't gonna be all that for two reasons the runtime and its rating PG13. Honestly venom will be a very fun and entertaining movie for those who simply don't understand the character and just wanna see a movie . But for the true fans venom is just extremely disappointing from its poor writing it's forced comedy and from being held back due to its PG13 rating .Now I wasn't very fond on the first film either and I think it's fair to say this one is a bit better but they haven't changed much in this film . The runtime is just awful you can just tell by watching the movie that had way more to the scenes and it would just cut away to another one it's just lazy and it's the reason of poor character development. Carnage is pretty cool but again poor character arc due to bad writing . And for those who are a fan of carnage well you don't see much carnage most of his killings are off screen IT REALLY (makes no sense) cause in the first film you actually see venom biting peoples heads off but I guess it would be too extreme if either of them did it in this one I just didn't understand it overall if you wanna see a movie I guess you can watch it . But if you truly care about the character's venom and carnage I suggest you skip the movie and watch the post credit scene it's not worth your time honestly .,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

671,vonnamilee,A lot of fun,10,3 October 2021,"The story itself is very fun, and it is very much an origin story. The story itself spends the entirety of its runtime getting us to know the character(s) more and getting us to love the characters more, which was successful IMO. It's a nice setup, the first movie being an origin story, and the second being a character building type of story, for what it leads itself into (post-credits scene) so truly, I had no complaints. It was fun and true to it's tone and that's all I could ask for as a casual enjoyer who's not looking to tears apart pieces of work to look for perfection when that's not possible.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
672,ethanrombal,A well done sequel but with a lot to be desired,8,3 October 2021,"Overall the movie was spectacular with a very strong action and comedy presence that highlighted Eddie's and Venoms relationship that was a main staple of the movie as it carried throughout the film. It did a very good job of leaving off where the last one ended and expanding their story while also allowing supporting characters to grow as well. The length of the movie clocked in around 90 minute's which is quite short for movies today however it felt much longer and I mean that in a good way, all the screen time was well used and every second helped project the movie forward without expanding un-useful plot points like it predecessor. In the end I would give the movie a 7.5 out of 10. I would of given it more however it lacked a certain elements that propel movies like these, as the main foes did not set a good standing for their fight but overall badass movie, if I were to include the end credit the movie is a solid 100000000000000000000/10.

When carnage is on the screen it's almost breathtaking but I personally believe he wasn't on the screen nearly enough. This movie is basically the lobster scene in the first one but 85 minutes of it. I would have given this movie a 5 or 6 but the mid credit scene might be the best one of all time so the rating jumps up a point or two.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
680,mobofdigi,One of the best Marvel movies since 2012,10,4 October 2021,"Unlike the MCU, this movie has passion, it may not have a extremely well written story but its the best that Marvel has had in consistency since 2012. The MCU after the first Avengers movie really started to fall apart, only really holding together through mediocrity and the gems along the way being really only. Ironman 3, Black Panther, and possibly a few others. Fox really only had one good Marvel movie though, being Old Man Logan's story reinterpreted as just Logan. Venom meanwhile I seen both the original and now Let there be Carnage, both times it hit home hard, these Venom movies have the same heart and passion as the old DC movies made before the Dark Knight, being campy and embracing the heritage of the comics they come from. Venom Let There Be Carnage embraces the gay nature of Venom as he developed in the comics to where we are majorly being hinted at to be getting Toxin. Venom's movie deserved the rated R given Carnage but I feel after the success of this movie, Sony will allow Hardy and main staff of these movies more creative freedom, possibly allowing the crossover with the MCU with the evident hint at Knull being a good threat for a multiversal level fight, especially if the Poisons are added in Anti-venom and possibly Silence. Honestly I see more potential in this newer franchise than the MCU at this point as those movies have started to run low on steam for me and several others in the consumers. While the MCU really only has big villains to build too, Venom can stay lower level, allowing more longevity especially given Carnage's many shenanigans. The MCU has to continue to build up threats from Thanos likely going to Galactus, Knull (Given the end credits of Venom Let there be Carnage), The Beyonders, and possibly a handful of others before cutting too deep with characters like Molecule Man or Ahnilus becoming big threats. Meanwhile Venom has the chance to continue onward, with the Life Foundation symbiotes, Agent Venom, Carnage and his cult, The Klyntar of other places in the universe, and it can even continue through Mania and even extend through other more heroic symbiotes like Scream or Toxin. Overall this movie gives a lot to come and makes Venom look to be the most promising movie franchise in the coming years as the MCU slows on momentum and the DCEU still trys to find its holding as the new Suicide Squad shown the right path for them to go down.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
681,ricardomata-02973,Should've been Rated R,7,4 October 2021,I really feel like this movie would've been way way better if it was Rated R. I mean this is carnage we're talking about. This movie should've been gory and more fights.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

683,yaroslav-06825,"Well, almost a masterpiece.",8,5 October 2021,"I've always been a fan of Spider-Man, including Venom. I think he's the coolest villain Spidey has ever had to deal with. And naturally I decided to go to the Venom 2 cinema. I also went to the first part, which left me mostly pleasant impressions. And what can I say about the second one ? Well, first of all I have to praise the great visual component. The graphics and battle scenes look just great ! I will also note the actors' performance well. Tom Hardy is on top as always ) And I was also delighted with the music ! In the final scene, when Venom climbed the church (or something like that), intense music sounded, it was so cool and appropriate that it gave me goosebumps. The whole epicness of what was happening was felt. It will be necessary to find this music on the Internet. Well, you can also throw a star for a reference to the second part of the Amazing Spider-Man with Andrew Garfield. In the finale, Venom lowered Brock's girlfriend down from the roof using his symbiote abilities, so there was a very similar scene with Spider-Man when Spidey Held Gwen on a web in the Chapel so that she would not fall down. In general, a very pleasant moment). But there are also disadvantages. I can't say that they spoil the film, but it would be better if they didn't exist. Namely, the silly jokes found throughout the film, and Venom's too goofy character. I think he should be a harsher character, although that's fine. I 'm happy to go to the third part when it comes out , and if you haven 't watched the second part of Venom yet , then hurry up to take a look ! I think you'll like it.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
684,watchtheducktalesreboot,"An enjoyable film, and I think that's enough",8,5 October 2021,"While from a more objective lens the film isn't the best made, I'm still rating it fairly high because I think it's ENJOYABLE. Not everything has to be a perfectly made masterpiece - especially superhero films! I think people forget this a lot. It's great if a movie has gorgeous cinematography, a plot that makes perfect logical sense, impeccable pacing ETC but the MOST important part of a movie is that it's enjoyable to watch! And Venom 2 was enjoyable to watch!It felt like a wonderfully refreshing change from the usual Marvel films. I think Marvel films have been loosing touch on what the original appeal of superheroes & supervillains are - it's just goofy, wacky fun that plays with an unrealistic concept! And you know, sometimes it's really cool & it works out when they experiment with more serious, dark or morbid stuff, I'm not saying it all has to be PG silly kids content, but I'm sick of how *not fun* superhero/villain films have been lately. Venom is fun!The plot is fairly simple & straightforward. The A plot is ""This serial killer has a symbiote now & we have to stop him"" & the B plot is ""Venom & Eddie are having relationship troubles"". Or ""friendship troubles"" if you want to be in denial. Anyway, I liked this. I liked how it wasn't overloading my brain with 50 plotlines to follow. It was simple, fun & an enjoyable watch.I thought the ""bigger villains"" of this film where more interesting & fun to watch than from the first film (especially Francis) & thought they made pretty good foils to the main characters. I did feel that sometimes the pacing was too breakneck fast & at points very jarring & inconsistent but also I think it fits the chaotic vibe of Venom pretty well, it just was a lot for me personally at some points.The GCI on Carnage was a lot better than what was going on with Riot in the first film & the action scenes where better too honestly. I appreciate how it leaned into the chaos more than the first film, but I wouldn't say it's hugely better. They're about the same level of enjoyability overall, honestly.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

686,zacharymaxfield,Best movie I've seen in a long time.,10,6 October 2021,I must've watched a different version of this movie than everyone else did. I've seen reviews where they're saying this movie was terrible and poor quality and overall dumb. This wasn't perfect by no means but was still way better then the first one. Yes it should've been rated R and had more carnage. But then again there was a good amount of death and destruction in this movie for it being rated pg-13. I've also seen reviews saying venom is supposed to be the bad guy. That's wrong. He's labeled as an anti-hero. Would I recommend this movie as a must watch. Absolutely. Would I go watch this movie a 3rd time. Absolutely. It's way better then the first one. To me this is the best movie I've seen all year. And trust me I've seen a lot of movies this year.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

688,walkenator,Generic movie with soft plot,1,7 October 2021,This movie has so little work put into it shows very heavily. The casting choice of Woody Harrelson is wrong. The character they wrote for Cletus Kasady turns a truly chaotic intimidating character into a generic villain with such boring motive that it's hard to believe that they actually could make a movie out of it.Venom and Eddie play more as a romantic comedy than one of spidermans best rogues in his gallery.The plot holes are everywhere. The movie has so little action and everyone is acting like they are in grade school with how they interact with each other.Things happen just because it would be a fun visual instead of it making sense to the characters or plot.Honestly even if you don't take into account the comic book versions of the characters it still is a generic hero movie in an oversaturated market with nothing to set it apart from the rest.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

I mean come on he's a psychopath. Make him a laughing maniacal psycho. That reeks of spilling real death & carnage. Here Cletus is one dimensional villain that venom gets to off near the end. It's truly a shameful waste. His girlfriend shriek was essentially shoehorned in to create conflict. Because of her screaming powers. She felt seriously handicapped in how she was presented. No character no sense of charm. She screams at the end. And Shazam venom saves the film. Alas, I say read the real carnage in the comics. Save yourself the trouble & rent this one.

The way they did explaining Cletus's story it was a awesome movie in total I really liked how good they did with the main fight it was a actual fight between venom and carnage and with the last movie it was a CGI silver and black liquid bomb with 2 people inside but this movie it was a good fight and all in total it was a pretty good movie it is worth checking out and in my book 10/10.,Venom - Let There Be Carnage

705,choprasukaran,This movie was good.,7,17 October 2021,"-WARNING, SPOILERS-When the movie had started I was very intrigued to see how this would be and by the end I was impressed by the action sequences, CGI on Carnage, post credit scene, the flashbacks to when Cletus and Francis were younger and Naomi Harris' acting as Shriek and Woody Harrelson's acting as Cletus Kassidy, especially Woody's acting as it genuinely gave me goose bumps and one of the flash back scenes made me think ""What the hell, Cletus really is a psychopath!"". I was disappointed by Venom's CGI and Carnage's voice. Carnage sounded like a mixture between Riot and Venom, whereas in the comics his voice is deep but not as deep as Venom's, he's suppose to sound like a sadistic clown but in the movie just sounds like Riot mostly. Venom's CGI wasn't the best as he just didn't look as good as he did in the first movie and I didn't like his new voice either. In the first movie, Venom was genuinely scary and bad ass, and his voice was just perfect but for the sequel it seemed like Sony focused a lot on Carnage and forgot about Venom. His eyes looked off and the symbiote just didn't seem to have the bold details, and it was strange that in some scenes Venom's CGI looked fine and then other scenes he either looked too skinny, smaller or had too much glow and the special effects looked obvious. This movie didn't live up to my expectations but it was a tad bit better than the first one so I do recommend watching it! The post credit scene was great as well, got so hyped at it! And it overall was a good movie!",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

The screenwriter didn't know if she was writing a comedy, horror or action film. My opinion is that there were plenty of mistakes that don't match the comic book premise. A rushed story that makes Eddie look like a real loser and an incompetent idiot. They make Cletus Kasada all knowing and Carnage a hight tech IT connoisseur who can hack everything :D .

Andy serkis and Tom Hardy should hold there heads in shame with this film it is terrible.

Hardy was hamming it up with the over acting to make up for everyone else's lack of acting, venom was a bumbling idiot compared to his first movie, and carnage didn't even feel like carnage. Just seemed like another generic symbiote character.

It delivers on exactly what you'd expect it to, and I loved every second of it. I made an account to leave this review because I see it's got a lower rating than the first one and I object.Hardy gave it his all, I won't let his now 3 hour long journey of talking to himself be in vain. I'd give it a 10/10 but it's not Perfect. It's Great to ME.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
736,degz77,Wanted More,6,2 October 2021,"As a big fan of Venom and Carnage growing up, I just wanted more. I get that this movie is supposed to just be come big campy humourous fun on the big screen. Some of the humor felt forced. I feel like Carnage wasn't given due justice to how truly terrifying he is. I wish the film took more of a horror angle instead of just camp. I just really wanted to love this movie and it's disappointing. The post credit scene made the movie honestly.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
737,edward-alexander-higham,Seriously disappointed...not as good as the first one,4,17 October 2021,"Venom was by no means an exceptional movie, but it was better than Let There Be Carnage. Overall, was disappointed by the length of the movie, it really wasn't enough. As such, the story was weak, with poor writing in my opinion. Music choices in the film didn't feel right either for some reason. The film felt very rushed, in terms of portraying the story and quite frankly the strings pulling the story together were in tethers. Would not go to see this film again, would not buy it to own at home. Very disappointed and wouldn't be interested in going to see it again. Only thing that made up for the film and allowed me to give it a four star was some of the action. Other than that, terrible.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
738,jacobrt33,"Andy, Tom - your movie sucked and it makes me sad",2,6 October 2021,"From the first minutes of this movie, the pacing is just terrible. It feels rushed, spliced, and weird. The remarkably boring love backstory is poorly acted and completely unnecessary! No character is given enough room to breathe or enough thought to develop at all, so you don't care about anything that happens to anyone - the entire movie. I spent 60 of the 90 minute runtime waiting for it to end. Action was fine but generic and, um, mushy. I wish they had put the focus on Cletus and given Carnage the buildup and menace that he deserved. Best part was the after-credit scene, second best part was the new Eminem song.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
739,zgteeen,Disappointing feels it was made to be an R rated,4,18 October 2021,"I guess due to Covid they needed the extra cash from the box office
Another flaw with the movie the way few scenes were there for 5 seconds when it felt like it was serving no purpose unless it needed to be longer
Some scenes as I said felt like it was made for an R rated so whatever they had to chop up they didOverall ok movie.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

742,oobao,My 6th grade movie project was better,1,2 October 2021,"-Minor spoilers. But it's not like there's any plot anyways-Beginning from the moment the movie started, I had no idea what was going on. Why Eddie was was talking to a guy in prison? Oh now Eddie and venom are split?? And now there's a red venom running around? The story isn't just bad, it's basically written and told so terribly it may as well not exist. The only thing good about this movie is the fight scene. And even that lasted for maybe 1/10th of the movie.I'm rarely one to make a review on a movie. But for the love of all things good, spare yourself. There's nothing in this worth watching except some neat cgi.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage

751,xifnxsyh,"Fun, Enjoyable, Great Action",7,2 November 2021,"Pros:
1. This movie is fun, enjoyable, the plot is simple and easy to understand. The best thing in this movie is the action, the highlight is for Carnage because he looks savage and everytime he appears on the screen will makes you feel thrilling and engaging.2. The relationship between Venom and Eddie in this movie was shown more details. We can see how and what's going on with Eddie's life since Venom lived inside his mind and body. There's few scenes that was funny and a bit emotional.3. Woody Harrelson as Cletus Casady was good and he is into the character. Everytime he met Eddie, the way he talks and his expression really fits as a serial killer.Cons:
1. This movie is too short and it makes the plot felt kinda rushed, so this affects the character of Carnage. We can't really see deep inside the character of Cletus Casady as a serial killer, they just tell the surface story like a little background of his life and what makes him wants to kill Eddie Brock and that's it, it was more like tell but not show. Ends up we doesn't felt good enough for the character building.2. I felt like they nerfed Venom way too much. I don't mind if they wanted to make the character kinda goofy, comedic, and has that sense of humor like what the comic book fans said that Venom is kinda goofy in the comics. But in this movie I think they overdone it until some point it doesn't felt funny and gets annoying, too childish. Venom is suppose to be savage and brutal as well but in this movie they make him more a comedic than savages.3. The relationship between Cletus and Carnage is not that great and nothing impactfull for the character, for some reason because this movie is short and we can't see more of what Cletus and Carnage can do. There's nothing that can makes you feel like they are serial killers, love chaos, brutal and killing people everywhere. And they seems like not together against one particular mission like they both have different objective to achieve and just use each other to move around and get their things done. At the end, they lose againts Venom because they didn't fit together.4. There's a character name Shriek which is Cletus girlfriend. I do know that in the comics they are couple. But in this movie her character seems like nothing, it doesn't help makes the story more interesting or giving any benefits or impact to the actual story between Venom n Carnage, she just appear as a side story for Cletus with nothing special and I personally doesn't even care about her character. The story can just go without her and in fact much better because they can only focus to Venom n Carnage.5. Lastly this movie is rated PG-13, and it's actually spoil the movie because they can't all out for the character on what they can or suppose to do. As we know that Venom n Carnage is a brutal and savages, they eat people and killing everywhere so it suppose to have that bloody and gore elements. But it's PG-13 and obviously we can't have that eventhough there's a scene which is quite brutal.Overall this movie is just okay and enjoyable, it's a popcorn movie where you can just enjoy the show especially for the action sequence that is great. For me, if this movie can be longer, can explore more about Carnage with an R-Rated, it could be better because it felt short and not that satisfying to watch just like the first one and I wanted to see more of their screentime. And don't miss the credit scene because that is the best moment throughout the entire movie and it's what all Marvel fans been waiting to see it.Rating: 7/10.",Venom - Let There Be Carnage
752,brennendecker,Reviewers be crazy,9,7 October 2021,This rating is nuts. It should definitely be higher. It's stuck-up fanboys and fangirls that don't like any Venom other than the exact one they know from the comics.This take on Venom is fresh and fun. You wanna enjoy yourself and have a fun time at the movies? You'll love this one. It's better than the first one which seemed like a trial run for the vastly superior sequel. In this one we actually have an entertaining and engaging villain played by Woody Harrelson who gives a very enjoyable performance.This movie is not bogged down by deep lore or canon. I love that stuff but it's not the only way to do things. Just have fun. Tom Hardy is great. The relationship between Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote will tug st your heartstrings.Plus.....dat mid-credits scene...,Venom - Let There Be Carnage
