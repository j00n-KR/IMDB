0,Leofwine_draca,Worst in a very long time,1,27 September 2021,"One of the very worst films I've seen in a long time. Impossibly, improbably arty but in an extremely dull, nothing happening kind of way. Couldn't stand the direction from the outset or the constant anachronisms which wear the viewer down. Apparently the idea from this came from the director playing with WILLOW figures in his back garden and that certainly shows. CGI talking animals, bored actors (Dev Patel, what are you up to?) and one good visual with the walking giants. A hated film.",The Green Knight
1,boblipton,The Matter Of Britain,8,31 July 2021,"David Lowery's movie version of the Middle English poem known as ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" is a thing of visual beauty and story weirdness. Believed to be written about the time of Chaucer in a completely different dialect of English, its basic story -- Gawain accepts a Christmas challenge by the Green Knight at blows with his axe; one year later, Gawain must present himself to the Green Knight and accept a similar blow. Gawain knocks off the fellow's head; the Knight picks it up, reminds Gawain of his promise and toddles off.Lowery's version is about the honesty of the world, and whether honor is more than thin air; whether, in the words of John Wooden, there is a difference between character and reputation. At first glance, Dev Patel would seem to be a weird choice for Gawain. Well, he is, but he handles the role very well, acting with face and body as well as words. Joel Edgerton is also excellent as the friendly lord who seriously tempts Patel. Cameraman Andrew Droz Palermo shoots the locations in Ireland and the whole thing is given a subtle muddy green tone that makes it all seem even weirder than it might.Because it is weird. Although this poem contains elements that hook into better known examples of the Matter of Britain as amplified by the French, there are hints in it that it partakes in other, forgotten traditions. Like Arthurian legends' British source, Welsh mythology, we no longer have any clear idea what they're about. The best we can manage are some rough parallels with other mythologies, but like the Mabinogion, they must remain obscure.Maybe that's a good thing for the individual artist. If no one can state authoritatively what a particular symbol means, then the artist is free to interpret. Indeed, that is the constant that gives these works their longevity: if the symbol remains constant, but the meaning changes, then each generation can find its own meaning. It may not suit people like me, who want their butterflies neatly pinned, labelled and stuck behind glass, but it does keep things lively.",The Green Knight
2,Horst_In_Translation,A kinda fantastic journey - think green!,6,25 August 2021,"""The Green Knight"" is a new movie in fact that just hit cinemas here and it is a co-production between Ireland, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and with this quartet nobody can really be surprised that it from beginning to end in the English language, even if thick accents are very frequent here. But let's take a look at the basics first: The writer and director is American filmmaker David Lowery, who has really received many accolades and awards now over the years and he launched his career as an editor, so it should not really surprise anybody that he also worked as an editor on this film here and on many other not too long ago, even if he has progressed to being the man in charge of the entire project as well. The title character is played by Dev Patel, who had his breakthrough with Slumdog Millionaire over a decade ago now, a film that won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Since then, he has also managed to score Oscar nominations himself and it is also kinda funny to compare his bearded self in 2021 with the boy he was back then briefly before the 2010s. He is in almost every scene from this movie from beginning to end and the only lead. Here and there, he is joined by the stunning Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander. Joel Edgerton is also always easy to identify and I kinda like the screen presence he has and the energy he usually brings to his roles. When he comments on the main character's language, there is also a really rare moment of comedy here almost. Not a funny movie. Does not aspire to be such. Back to the cast, there are other familiar faces like Barry Keoghan who you could recognize if you saw his Yorgos Lanthimos movie. He is easy to identify really, seemed to be a bit of a clumsy friend in his first scene, there to maybe to get in some comic relief, but turned out he is something else entirely.Keoghan is by the way an actor who originates from Ireland and this is why he also fit very nicely in this film. This is a really Irish movie, not only because of the strong presence of the color green, but also because of the names of locations and characters. Even Dev Patel, who is really everything but Irish, plays a character named Gawain. Enough said. By the way, he is not the title character, is he? I'm not sure. There is constantly talk about him (not) being a knight, but I kept thinking it's maybe the one who shows up initially to submit this challenge. That character, who we also see in the end again luckily, was almost more memorable to me than Patel's. He looked so amazing visually and everything fit there and I would immediately watch a film about this character. Great voice as well. Or how they show us the method through which the queen reads this very special letter at the beginning. And how it exhausts her right away when she is finished as if some evil spirit possessed her. You can discuss if this tree-like creature is evil. At least he has red blood as we see when he is decapitated. Or seemed to have been decapitated initially. And of course he did not feel any fear. He knew he could stay alive, maybe thanks to his magical axe. That axe was also a really nice inclusion. I mean look at tiny little plants coming out of the area around it when it is laid down. That was a really small moment, but great attention to detail and memorable as a consequence. Also, you must understand that this is not a superhero movie, evven if it is a fantasy movie. It may come easy to think of The Green Hornet, Green Lantern, Green Arrow... when reading the title, but it turns out something completely different. But still good.There are not too many flaws for me with this film, even if it also did not reach greatness for me overall. Or too rarely. I struggled a bit for example with how quickly the main character has a bit of a falling-out with Edgerton's character or also with the fox immediately afterwards who seemed like a loyal companion before that. That came a bit surprising for sure, but maybe also indicates how nothing is safe in terms of belonging and friendship when the adventure continues. Probably our hero here was a bit of a loner. Maybe also that is why he did not really have too much to lose when accepting the strange visitor's proposal and he was the only one who did. I just mentioned the fox. That one I have to go with again. I liked the scene in which he was introduced in a way with this woman who was actually a spirit. Also I really liked the way the fox was animated. Incredibly cute. I want that one in my life. But this animal also symbolized in a way that the protagonist did not want to be 100% alone as we see when he allows the fox (never know if I should say ""he"", ""she"" or ""it"", but one thing is safe: I won't say ""they"") to enter. Other highlights from this film except the little fox was the scene in which the ruthless fighter introduced himself and came to visit the king and bring him this letter. You could see that he was not scared at all because he knew he would get out there alive 100%. His laughter actually sounded on the evil side. The king asking the male protagonist before that to come sit with him did feel a bit random though, even if he was his nephew. The connection with the young man's mother and how she is potentially a witch. Well, that I was not too big on or added very little from me.Then there is the color green. Many beautiful shots including this. One I remember in particular is towards the end when out hero(?) is there and sees the creature he has been looking for. We see this shot in two different shades of green basically. Also Vikander's speech on the significance of the color green in nature, but also how men see it and react to it, was a true highlight. Vikander turned that monologue into something truly memorable and haunting. Big thumbs-up to her and that powerful scene alone proved that she is among the finest actresses from her generation as of now without a doubt. As I am getting closer to the end of this review, let me say a few words about the ending. It seemed like a lightning-speed fast-forward look at the coming decades when the protagonist returns and becomes kking, but his cowardice always haunts him and eventually also has him lose his head. So he will be headless no matter what. Then we see it was really just a what-if, a premonition you could say. There Lowery also toys a bit with the audience. When the forest creature compliments the boy that he finally understood and made the right choice, you could think that the crucial blow would be nothing devastating or murderous, but it probably is. We do not know 100% because this is where the film ends. With how he goes for him before that, I cannot imagine though that he let him live. By the way, I also liked there how the forest creature basically sits on his throne this calmly when Patel's character shows up. He has all the time in the world really and now all his focus is on resting, maybe sleeping. And the ""aye"" as an answer to this crucial question instead of a ""yes"" I appreciated too.So yeah, all in all a pretty good movie. I see critics liked these over two hours much more than general audiences apparently. I am not sure if I am surprised or not. I think this film has the potential for an even higher rating on rewatch and it feels like a very rewatchable movie that offers a great deal of quality even if you know the ending. Maybe especially if you know the ending. Perhaps then also some scenes will become bit clearer like what happened with the thieves in the forest (or their leader I should say) after they stole the axe. Or what was the meaning of the skeleton. We will see. But there is not the flightest doubt for my positive recommendation this time. It gets a thumbs-up for sure and I suggest you check this one out and as I am not always big on fantasy films, this mans something. Well done to Lowery and everybody else involved with the production and shooting of this one here. It also felt shorter to me which is always a good sign, especially when a movie crosses not only the 100-minute mark, but even the 120-minute mark. And pretty comfortably in fact. It's closer to two hours and fifteen minutes. A success from every perspective, no matter which one you look at: sound effects, direction, story, acting, visual effects, make-up, costumes, cinematography. I think it could score several Oscar nominations next year. And deservedly so. If I am not mistaken, it wasn't eligible yet for the 2021 Academy Awards.",The Green Knight
3,nogodnomasters,Is it Christmas?,5,7 August 2021,"Dev Patel stars as Gawain who must fight the Green Knight (Ralph Ineson) in this retelling of the tale or poem. The Green Knight arrives at Christmas and issues a challenge to exchange blows. Gawain volunteers and goes first, loping off his head. The knight picks up his head and reminds Gawain he must be at the Green Castle (6 days ride by a very slow horse) next Christmas to get his head cut off.Most of the story is his journey filled with magic and deceit.Dev Patel was good as Oliver Twist. As Gawain it was an anachronism because he phoned it in as did the rest of the cast. I found the acting bland and a plot that wasn't hitting on all cylinders. I did like the creepy settings.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",The Green Knight
4,kosmasp,It's not a game,10,1 August 2021,"Bear with me for a second. I am going to compare this to another movie. And the comparison will be ... not the strongest for most I reckon. The movie I am talking about is Unforgiven. Now obviously the main character couldn't be more different. Young vs old, experienced vs no experience at all.Why I do like and see a connection you ask? Because both are a takedown, a dismantling of what we know, of what movies and other sources may have told us. Whereas it was about the cowboy myth in Unforgiven, which I have to rewatch asap, or the impression(s) we have of Knights in this.Having said that, it doesn't mean the director here was thinking of the Clint Eastwood classic, but just had it as a general idea too. I also should note that I have not seen the ""other versions of"" this movie, as they are referred to here on imdb. So there are a few other movies that are based on the same story I reckon.Now onto this, that has so many things working for it. Set design, costume design, cinematography and most of all: sound and music design. And this is not about it being loud (which it is at times), it is about how careful it is designed to draw you in ... to give you every little thump, every little crack, every small but also big sound that the enviroment is able to provide. Exceptional would not even begin to cover it. I usually am not so aware of that department, but if this does not at least get nominated for an Oscar ... well something is wrong I'd say.The acting is amazing as well. But be wary, because the pacing will not be to everyone's liking. I went into this without any knowledge - except having seen the poster (knew Dev Patel was starring) and therefor knowing the title. Which is always helpful when ordering a ticket at your local cinema.Apart from the pacing, the movie may have beautiful cinematography as mentioned, but it is not afraid of the dark (no pun intended). It really relishes in it at times. So much so, that you may even curse because you can't make out much. It almost feels like this was shot with natural light only. I imagine they used film lights too, but especially those dark passages will have you believe otherwise. I have not checked, might do when the movie comes out on disc.So all in all this is far removed from any popcorn version of heroes and knights ... but if you can dig that and how the movie handles many things - you are in for a ride (again no pun intended). If you liked it, stick with the movie and the credits for an additional scene - which will not mean anything to you if you didn't like the movie in the first place.",The Green Knight
5,Tweekums,The delightfully strange tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,8,29 September 2021,"This film; inspired the fourteenth century poem 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'. Shortly after the story begins a mysterious knight clad in green armour enters the king's court on Christmas day and challenges any knight to strike him... on condition that one year later that knight will find the knight in his green chapel and suffer an identical blow. Sir Gawain accepts the challenge and decapitates the knight; to his surprise the knight picks up his head and leaves. A year later Gawain heads out seeking the knight; the journey will be long and arduous; along the way he will meet various people; some friendly, others less so.I rather enjoyed this film; the story is suitably mystical with a strange feel to much of it. The film impressively captures the quest as Gawain travels though bleak landscapes encountering various characters. The Irish locations used are stunning in their rugged beauty. The cast does a solid job; most obviously Dev Patel in the role of Sir Gawain. Alicia Vikander is also notable in the dual roles of Essel, a woman Gawain loves, and the lady he meets in a castle shortly before his arrival at the Green Chapel. There are some ambiguous moments, including the ending that may irritate some viewers but I enjoyed them... not every film has to have everything explained. Overall an impressive film that is well worth watching. I watched it on television but imagine it looked even better on the big screen.",The Green Knight
6,CinemaSerf,Great looking test of chivalric values.,7,9 October 2021,"There's something of the Terry Gilliam to this adaptation of this engaging Arthurian legend. During a New Year's Eve banquet at Camelot, an enormous green knight arrives on horseback and challenges one of the assembled knights to strike a single blow across his neck. The only one to rise to the bizarre challenge is ""Sir Gawain"" (Dev Patel) but there is a catch - in one year he must present himself in the knight's Green chapel many leagues away and allow a similar bow to be laid upon him. As that fateful date looms, we follow the surreal adventures of the young ""Gawain"" as he makes his way to fulfil his obligation. Patel is good in this film, as is Joel Edgerton as the mysterious Lord whom, along with his wife """"Essel"" (Alicia Vikander) and the mysterious young scavenger (Barry Keoghan) add vividly to this demonstration of the temptations, and of the determination of our honourable young man to resist them - in their many different, sometimes mystical guises. This is a gorgeous looking film, the photography is glorious as is the Irish scenery and the pace of the film allows us to take our time to consider the moral of the tale. It's a touch long, the story itself doesn't quite support two hours plus, and the ending does deviate slightly from the original 14th Century tae - but it's a brave and entertaining effort that focusses more on the meaning of the story rather than offering us a Hollywood style adventure yarn. Big screen if you can - the whole film looks much better that way.",The Green Knight
7,Calicodreamin,"Graphically beautiful, nonsensical",3,5 August 2021,"As most artisanal movies go, the visually were breathtaking, with this aura hanging over ever scene. However, the storyline plot and dialogue were downright nonsensical, what the hell were even half those scenes about? I have no idea. Made no sense, I got lost and bored ten minutes in.",The Green Knight
8,evanston_dad,Bold Experiment Is a Misfire,6,20 August 2021,"I think I just don't like Dev Patel.I haven't liked a single movie he's yet been in (loathed ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" barely tolerated ""Lion"") but I wasn't sure whether it was him that was the problem or the movie around him.Maybe it's a bit of both, because while I don't like him in ""The Green Knight"" either, I'm not sure the movie around him would have worked even with a different actor. It's a bold experiment from David Lowery, who's now done one movie I adored (""A Ghost Story"") and one I hated (""A'int Them Bodies Saints""). I didn't hate this one, but it really tested my patience, and I was mostly done with it by the time it was over.It's one of those episodic quest movies, and it's dully repetitive. Hero comes across some strange, magical character or situation, hero must solve some riddle, hero moves on to next strange, magical situation. It's all very one note and so dreamlike that it has no narrative momentum. Watching it, I was like, ""Ok, now this arbitrary thing is just happening,"" to the point that late in the film, when our hero comes across a herd of giants marching toward the horizon and hitches a ride on one of them, I barely registered the wonder of it, because it seemed just as random as anything else happening.I did like the sleight of hand at the end of the film, the glimpse of what might have been and then the punchline of the film's last line. But by that time I had checked out and the creative ending couldn't overcome my overall lackluster reception of everything that had come before.Grade: C.",The Green Knight
9,ferguson-6,stylish medieval mind-bender,8,29 July 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. If you are at all inclined to see this movie, then I would encourage you to do so ... and brace yourself for a surreal and mystical treat unlike any other medieval tale previously adapted for the big screen. Writer-director David Lowery re-teams with A24, the studio that also distributed his critically-acclaimed 2017 film, A GHOST STORY, to deliver a trip for your senses based on the tale of Sir Gawain - a tale that's been told in various and often contradictory ways over many years.Dev Patel (LION, 2016) stars as Gawain, the nephew of an ailing King Arthur (Sean Harris, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE - FALLOUT, 2018) and Guinevere (Kate Dickie, THE WITCH, 2015). When not imbibing with his friends, shaggy Gawain spends his time in the throes of intimacy with his paramour, Essel (Oscar winner Alicia Vikander sporting a pixie do). Young Gawain feels unworthy when he's amongst the knights and dreams of becoming an important man, so that he too may regale the King with his tales of adventure.Gawain's mother (Sarita Choudhury), in an attempt to facilitate her son's dreams, uses her witchcraft to conjure up his first opportunity for greatness ... and the film's first visually stunning moment. We are mesmerized as The Green Knight (Ralph Ineson, THE WITCH, 2015) makes his entrance riding a great steed into the room where the Knights are gathered at their Round Table. The Green Knight, best described as a giant Groot (from GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY), puts forth a challenge that only Gawain is willing to take up. The scene is stunning and memorable, and allows Gawain one year of celebrity before the second part of the challenge must be faced.It's at this point where Gawain sets off on his journey ... one that can be likened to Homer's ""The Odyssey"", in that it's filled with surprises and obstacles that defy logic and explanation. The surprises include: Barry Keoghan (DUNKIRK, 2017) as a garrulous, yet deceitful forest scavenger; the ghost of St Winifred (Erin Kellyman) requesting help locating her skull in the swamp; scantily-clad (CGI) bald-headed giants slowly roaming the forest; and a Lord (Joel Edgerton) and his mistress who offer shelter and advice that may or may not be helpful. Also on his journey to meet back up with The Green Knight, Gawain is accompanied by a red fox that holds his own surprises.Director Lowery's film is a surreal, hypnotic medieval becoming-a-man tale that is both epic and intimate. There is much to unwrap here, including the witches who clearly establish women's control of men, and the idea that some may view themselves as destined for greatness, but blink when the moment of truth arrives. We do get a glimpse of Excalibur, and Lowery's frequent collaborator Daniel Hart's excellent score expertly blends with the infusion of metal music. The film requires the heightened use of your senses, and the fascinating work of cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo keeps us zoned in on each character and every scene.In theaters Friday, July 30, 2021.",The Green Knight
10,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - The Green Knight (2021) 7.3/10,7,27 October 2021,"""So, the catch is, as texturally, chromatically, visually captivating as a period production can be (Daniel Hart's exotic, enchanting incident music holds its own too), THE GREEN KNIGHT has meager vigor and satire to spare. Since its source doesn't possess a firm narrative structure, Lowery complies slavishly to the episodic and elliptical incidents and wallow in the flights of fancy of its production value instead, his paucity of competence in transfiguring the story to a more cohesive and empathetic fable is the film's feet of clay.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",The Green Knight
11,MOscarbradley,Exactly what audience is this aimed at?,3,5 October 2021,"You would have to go back to ""Excalibur"" to find an Arthurian movie that looked or sounded remotely like David Lowery's ""The Green Knight"". This is the Middle-Ages as gritty and downright dirty as they come, (think Richard Lester or ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""), while still aiming to deliver the fantastical, magical goods a genre picture like this requires.The hero of our tale is Gawain, (Dev Patel, excellent given the material he has to work with), who, in the film's opening scene, becomes something of a hero after defeating the Green Knight who has challenged him to a Christmas duel in what appears to be the court of King Arthur but there's a catch; there's an addendum to the duel and Gawain's life isn't quite the same afterwards as he rides off to meet the Green Knight for round two the following Christmas.Lowery's film is certainly no ""Ivanhoe"" but an adult fairytale that deliberately sets out to alienate a mass audience. This is an art-house movie that might please the critics but is unlikely to prove popular at the box-office. Indeed it's hard to figure out exactly what audience it's aimed at.Visually, it's often remarkable, again mixing fantasy and realism to good effect. The cast are also well chosen but, Patel aside, are given very little to do though that most brilliant of young Irish actors, Barry Keoghan, has no trouble stealing the movie in his couple of scenes. The real problem lies both in the film's length and almost total lack of action. Gawain's adventures are singularly unadventurous and ultimately the film comes across as both boring and pretentious, unforgiveable sins in a film of this kind. Still I can see Razzie glory come the awards season.",The Green Knight

I'm sad beacause I didn't see this movie in the cinema. In the country I live in, cinemas are still not active due to the pandemic. There are those who call the movie a very good movie, and those who say it is very bad. I've read both the bad reviews and the good reviews, not caring about my own opinion. I understood the comments of people who called the movie a good movie, but I never understood those who said it was a bad movie. Isn't the movie beautifully and correctly adapted to the book? Is that why they didn't like the movie? There's no such thing as a book adaptation will necessarily be the same, don't they know that? Each director adds his own interpretation to the film, there are always differences from the book. I'm sorry, but most of bad comments are nonsense. The movie is a great movie all round. The acting was amazing, Dev Patel did a great job. Cinematography, atmosphere, music, acting, cgi and etc. Were great. It was amazing. I like the movie very much. I wish I could watch it in the cinema. As I said, I've never read the book and I didn't know the story at all, although I really liked the movie. I am going to buy the book ;) But it should be noted that this movie is not for everyone. Most people can get bored of the movie, but that doesn't mean the movie deserves 1 point. What's this ?

The plot was very interesting but the way that was presented was not the best mainly due to its long duration. The interpretation of Dev Patel who played as Gawain was very good but the direction did not help him reveal his true potential. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Sarita Choudhury's who played as Mother, Sean Harris' who played as the King and Alicia Vikander's who played as Essel / The Lady. The direction which was made by David Lowery was not the best and I believe that he did not reach his potential and the movie's potential.

16,SAMTHEBESTEST,An medieval Epic told with fancy visuals and intriguing storytelling but is too slow to hold your interest.,6,28 August 2021,"The Green Knight (2021) :
Brief Review -An medieval Epic told with fancy visuals and intriguing storytelling but is too slow to hold your interest. The Green Knight is based on the 14th century peem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and someone who is interested in medieval tales can surely find it interesting. But let me warn you that this 130 minutes film does not offer any pacy flow and that definition defiles most of your interest. The film tells Gawain's story with high intensity and that gives it something to be praised by critics, however, a major chunk of family audience can just finish their one or two naps during the watch. When it comes to fantasy stories, people expect some fun, engaging narrative and adventurous entertainment along with eye-pleasing visuals and The Green Knight provides nothing expect for beautiful visuals. That suspense and dark toned storytelling seems streched for no reasons and when you understand what actually happened at the end, you just scratch your head like, 'Oh so this was it.. Why did they take so long for it then?'. Anyways, let's talk about the positives. The performance of Dev Patel is fantastic. One of the main reason why people should watch this film. Second, the entire team who handled technical aspects. From cinematography to background score to costumes to art design to visual effects, everyone from the crew should be hailed for their Brilliant efforts. Talking about the direction, David Lowery could have made it better, especially with the slow-paced narrative. That blame can be passed on the screenwriter and so Lowery can be termed as a fine worker with whatever job he has done. The supporting cast adds something more watchable and thanks to them otherwise this would have ended up as an average product. Overall, The Green Knight is watchable and Good but could have been much much better if tried a little harder.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",The Green Knight

18,stevendbeard,Good & Strange,7,30 July 2021,"I saw ""The Green Knight"", starring Dev Patel-Chappie, The Last Airbender; Alicia Vikander-Tomb Raider_2018, Jason Bourne; Joel Edgerton-Red Sparrow, The Thing_2011 and Sean Harris-the Mission:Impossible movies, Prometheus.This is a medieval Knights of the Round Table type story that is good & strange. It's good, as far as the costumes and visuals go, but some elements of the story are a little strange. Dev plays Sir Gawain, a want_to_be Knight but he drinks and parties too much. Sean plays his uncle, King Arthur, and wants to groom him to be the next King. Alicia plays Dev's girlfriend. The Green Knight is part man and part plant-hence the name-and he shows up at the Round Table with a challenge: Any Knight can strike him with the fiercest blow that they can muster, but one year later, the Knight must travel to the Green Knight's castle where he will return the same blow to that Knight. Well, Dev wants to show his fortitude & ingenuity and jumps to the challenge, cutting off the Green Knight's head-thinking that should settle things with no second part to the test to worry about. The Green Knight picks up his head and rides off, laughing.

In the yarn that appears to have inspired THE GREEN KNIGHT, a beautiful new girl suddenly pops up at school. She always wears the same elaborate scarlet ribbon around her neck. Speaking of which, this mysterious newbie is shockingly willing to go far beyond the limits of the long-time young female denizens of grandpa's neighborhood during make-out sessions. However, she has one hard and fast rule: Guys could do as they pleased in adjusting or removing her other garments, but the wanton new wench insisted that they NEVER touch the scarlet ribbon around her neck! For a few blissful weeks, things sailed along on an even keel, with some of the guys doing a lot more than merely ""copping a feel."" However, one foul night Pothead Peter was puffing on another joint, and maybe letting his mostly undressed first-time companion toke a little, too. Suddenly, completist Pete reaches up and undoes the scarlet ribbon sported by the otherwise bare daring damsel and her whole head falls clean off!

21,kevin_robbins,"After 125 minutes you're left with a whole lot of ""why did I watch this"" feelings",4,4 August 2021,"The Green Knight (2021) is a movie we saw in theatres the weekend it was released. The storyline follows the queen's nephew on a mission to prove his valor and partake in an adventure as a newly anointed knight. When a strange mythical tree-like creature arrives at the kingdom and offers a mission he jumps at the opportunity to prove himself without fully understanding the perils that go with it. Can the young knight overcome the mission and become a hero within the kingdom or will his first adventure be his last? This movie is directed by David Lowery (Pete's Dragon) and stars Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire), Anaïs Rizzo (Rain), Sarita Choudhury (Lady in the Water), Erin Kellyman (The Falcon and the Winter Soldier) and Sean Harris (Mission Impossible). The storyline for this picture had a lot of potential with a great build-up, settings, back drops and special effects. The acting was solid and the cast fit the characters well. Unfortunately, the storyline and characters never evolve. There's no real point to the story. You hope the main character learns from his mistakes and circumstances...he never does. You hope the storyline has a good point and conclusion, it doesn't. After 125 minutes you're left with a whole lot of ""why did I watch this"" feelings and faces within the audience. This was a huge disappointment and nowhere near better films in this genre like Pan's Labyrinth, The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings. I'd skip this and score it a 4/10.",The Green Knight
22,alindsay-al,A Below Average Over-reach of a film,4,7 October 2021,"This film had plenty of buzz about it when it just disappeared off of the UK release calendar. But The Green Knight has finally come to Amazon Prime and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees one of King Arthur's Knights sent on a quest to prove himself.Main Character
Dev Patel plays the main character Gawain and he does an alright job. Patel is a really good actor and he does manage to show that here with a decent performance, but the issue is I never cared about the character and despite Patel clearly trying I just found him quite unlikeable. You spend the majority of the film with this man and I guess I never felt a real connection with him and it just bought down my entire enjoyment of the film.Supporting Characters
There are some big names in this film, Alicia Vikander and Joel Edgerton are the best of the bunch. It's not there best work but they deliver some good moments and the film became more interesting once they were given more to do in it. The rest of the cast offer little whether it be Sean Harris as the king or some of the B list MCU actors such as Barry Keoghan and Erin Kellyman who get little to work with.Story
The story actually does some interesting things at the end, it isn't an easy watch for sure. You have to work out what is going on, but the last 15 mins or so are fascinating and it feels like with a better film it would be a perfect ending. But the rest of the film is just a bit strange and unfocused, as he meets people on his journey it is just too broken up and confusing. It really tries to make this a really deep film, but I think it just went too far and gave pretty much nothing definitive on screen and made it all open to interpretation which makes it a very hollow experience.Script
The script is just nothing, as I said above, the majority is made to be open to interpretation which just leads to a lot of big words that mean nothing. The drama fails to deliver and this is a very humourless affair.Style
Easily the best part of this film is the visuals and score, they are literally incredible. If I was just rating these two factors this film would be a 10/10 but there are way too many other issues. A big one being the pacing of the film, it just drags a lot. This isn't an action or fantasy action film and it never really picks up the pace with it feeling like a slog.Overall
Overall, The Green Knight is a below average really disappointing film. With all the build up I was excited to finally watch The Green Knight but it just over-reached and tried all these wacky ideas with a weak execution.",The Green Knight

If they strike him down they must agree to come to the green chapel a year later where they will receive the return blow. Dev Patel plays Gawain who volunteers to do this.Extremely beautiful, mystical and rather ambiguous take on the famous poem with Patel convincing as Gawain who spends the year on the quest to get to the green chapel. Not always easy to follow with all its often bizarre imagery, visions and flashbacks and who did what and why and what does that mean are questions that keep cropping up. It is engrossing though and captures the spirit of the time and the poem. Definitely not for those expecting an Arthurian adventure though.",The Green Knight

26,Pairic,A new take on the epic poem,8,29 September 2021,"He Green Knight: A Folk Horror take on this Epic Medieval Poem. Even shades of Macbeth as Morgan le Fay (Sarita Choudhury) along with her two ""sisters"" perform a magic rite to summon up The Green Knight. The Green Knight (Ralph Ineson) himself is reminiscent of the Green man of the forests, indeed his skin is of bark as he rides a destrier into King Arthur's Court, Sir Gawain (Dev Patel) who is Morgan's son takes up TGK's challenge but is allowed to decapitate him. The head (not the only talking one in the film) then addresses Gawain telling him that in a year he must travel to the Green Chapel to receive a similar blow. This narrative strays from that of the Poem in places and could be seen as revisionist as well as the Folk Horror Tropes it takes some influences from Boorman's Excalibur and Kurzel's Macbeth.Gawain's lover Essel is of common stock and he cruelly abandons her for a Lady once Essel has borne him a son, both are played by Alice Vikander. Gawain's quest to meet TGK takes him across changing landscapes but it is obvious that a sickness is upon the land, wrecked castles, fields covered in corpses and bones, people cutting down the last trees. He is ambushed by feral youths led by Robert Keoghan, meets a friendly fox, spirits and strange lodgings in a forest. Ritual again is important, Gawain wears a green girdle made by Morgan, full of runes and bones, this will protect him. Time moves in strange ways, flows back on itself, offers different possible outcomes. Uneven in parts nevertheless this is an engrossing retelling of the tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Stunning cinematography, production design and costumes. Written, Directed & Edited by David Lowery. 8/10.",The Green Knight
27,masonfisk,DEFINITELY NOT FOR EVERYONE...!,7,12 August 2021,"From David Lowery (A Ghost Story/Pete's Dragon) comes his latest & it's one of those films which will divide audiences into 'love it' or 'hate it' factions. Based on the famous Anonymous work detailing Sir Gawain's, played by Dev Patel, claim to fame when during one Christmas a figure barges into their celebratory proceedings to throw down a challenge (strike me & in one year hence I will do strike you back in kind) which Patel steps up to the plate to meet as he cuts his head off but then the challenger picks up his decapitated pate & rides off into the sunset cackling his heart out. A year passes & Patel hits the road towards his goal; the green knight's lair but along the way he gets robbed, encounters giants, befriends a fox that can talk who warns him of the futility of his quest & a couple in spitting distance of his quarry which offer up temptations of the conjugal kind. Along the way we get the sense maybe the journey may be all in Patel's head (especially after a scene of Patel partaking in some hallucinogenic mushrooms) which may the point since the majority of physical conflicts are fought in the mind before the first punch is thrown. As to the look & feel of the film, Lowery has definitely concocted a trek of the senses w/the offbeat casting (Sarita Choudhury as his mom, Erin Kellyman as a ghost & Alicia Vikander as Patel's love interest at home & again in another role as a woman who offers herself to him in full view of her mate, played by Joel Edgerton) but overall the thrust of the narrative (w/much made about Lowery's laboring for nearly a year putting the finale together in the editing room) may feel overthought & overworked when the source material, I gather, is fairly straight forward. Also starring Sean Harris as King Arthur, Barry Keoghan as a scavenger on the road & the dulcet tones of Ralph Ineson (he played the father in The Witch) who voices the Green Knight.",The Green Knight
28,Agent10,What a bizarre and unique film,7,15 August 2021,"First and foremost, how in the world did this film get a mainstream release? A film usually pigeon-holed for a limited art house release doesn't get this type of mainstream access, and this is why I think there are quite a large number of confused and angry reviews on this page.First of all, this film was supposed to come out in 2020 and I was definitely intrigued by the trailer and by the previous film ""Ghost Story"" David Lowery directed. Perhaps the changed advertising and the attempted morphing of this film into some kind of action packed adventure lead to some misleading expectations. I wouldn't be surprised, but I don't think it would have been intentional. It wouldn't be like 1998's ""Funny Games,"" where Michael Hanneke intentionally deceived audiences into thinking his film would be a wild thriller akin to a Tarantino outing and then doing it again with an English shot-for-shot remake in 2007. I think too many expected a lot of violence and sword play, and what they got was a very old school sermon to the gospel of Kubrick, Tarkovsky and Bergman.The Green Knight is like nothing else in most summertime cinemas, and it is a welcome escape from the loud noises and explosions of usual summer fare. I can see why people would be angry about not getting a swash buckling adventure, but I don't understand the vitriol of being called a ""bad"" movie. Is it perfect? Certainly not. However, it adds a bit of complexity both visually and from a story telling standpoint. Few words are spoken throughout, and many shots drag on for several minutes at a time. Its certainly daring, utilizing modern technology in ways that would have been difficult for the grand masters of yore. The ending was especially amazing to me as the seamless and quiet montage was both eerie and brilliant all in one.My only real complaint was the fact the film probably could have used some better overall editing. The color timing was much too dark in the scenes that could have been vibrant and in much need of light. The sound also could have used some help, for too often the soft voices are lost. In reality, the film was fine in my opinion, but those changes would have levied an 8 or maybe even a 9 on my review. I did find the casting of Dev Patel quite interesting, for I feel he is way too underutilized as an actor.If you are a student of film and like watching these kinds of films, I would definitely recommened it.",The Green Knight

30,rgkarim,"A Quest For Many Moral Reflections, This Green Experience Is A Tad Boring",8,31 July 2021,"LIKES:A Deeper Reflection:
The Green Knight does not disappoint in the pursuit of making you think, as the epic fantasy world is a canvas to once more reflect on the concepts we take for granted. Gawain's legend involves lots of inner reflection in his journey to face the Green Knight, set up with choices that would make any mere mortal potentially hesitate in what their morals will lead them next. Time is certainly one of the deadliest components we face in this world, and in this film, that device is used brilliantly to show you how unnerving and mentally taxing the gift of time can be no matter how long you have. These mental challenges are geared towards the artistic minded certainly, no more so than the ending where the reflection will really hit you in the face should you stay that long.The Fox:
I love seeing cute animal sidekicks tag along and the fox that Gawain travels with is certainly up that alley. Beautifully animated and designed, he obtains the level of detail that I always look for in films, only bleeding into the artificial look a handful of times when they anthropomorphize him in the film. Yes, they handled the animal companion super well in this film and never compromised the integrity of the mature film they wanted to present in this film, which is a nice piece of work indeed.The Dialogue:
Fantasy films are indeed filled with the archaic language of Medieval times that sometimes get lost to either common language to make it easy, or so lost in the old ways it's like Shakespeare that you are stumped more than certain. Fortunately, the Green Knight accomplishes the balance to utilize both in a manner that brings you into the world of Arthurian legend, without drowning you in a deluge of poetic language that is complicated to be distracting. I liked hearing them speak as if lost in the fantasy world, talking as if they were naturally placed in the world from long ago, adding that extra edge that I appreciate when it comes to world building in the movies.The Visuals:
Truly the biggest thing of the movie is the visual spectacular that A24 accomplished in this film. Gawain's world is once again focused on the darker, ashy aspects that prepared the viewer for the atmosphere of the movie and how dark the legend of Gawain is, or at least this interpretation. That filter really helps set the tone in almost every aspect of the film, and helps establish each frontier as both beautiful and deadly depending on how you look. Scene wise itself, again one is welcomed to the visuals of beautiful shots of the countryside that he walks through and finding the right shots that not only show the natural beauty of the world, but also the foreboding weight on our knight's shoulders during this quest. Even the more emotional moments have that look to them that sometimes properly censors things, but also gives you the full impact of the choices they made and the impact that they may have on the journey. Finally, the costumes and graphics themselves have brought their own splendor in themselves and how they help you get immersed further in the legend at hand. Certainly the costume designers have done their homework, designing armor that is influenced by its origins instead of generic tunics and dresses that sometimes plague these films. The green knight himself was the most engaging piece for me if only he had more screen time to see what else they could have done with the spectacle that was him. Still the visuals are gorgeous and the thing worthy of seeing in the movie theater if I'm being honest.The Acting:
I do have to give a nod to the acting in this film and how well-executed they were given the complexity that this movie was. Patel himself is the central pillar and hits his marks well in both verbal and nonverbal cues as you get the suffering this man is going through on this quest/game. It's layered, it's realistic, and it shows just how great he is at these roles that require more than delivering a joke. Alicia Vikander is stunning in her role as a mystic to say the least. Her words are smooth and velvety offering so much reward and yet punishment as she helps peel back the layers of our character to further challenge the knighthood that this movie is about. Though short time on the screen, Vikander proves she can do a lot with a little. As for Edgerton, he was great in his role as a hunter, and though not the center stage of the show, his character again offers another venue of personality that is sort of stark contrasting to the rest of the film. I liked his introduction and what it offered, but again wanted more time with his character to really get more of the performance aspect with him.DISLIKES:More time with some characters
The movie I know is about one man's journey and I respect that in this artistic chronicle of life, but creating characters only to limit their use never makes sense to me. So many great characters offered the potential to really engage in the character, their backstories certainly offering some glimmers into the depths of these challenges, but las most were lost. Though Patel is a strong actor, and it is the legend of his character, I myself prefer more engagement than what we got. This was especially true for his mother, the mysterious character who got events started and had very little involvement outside of some quick shots. I would have loved to see more into this character as well, given the atmosphere of this character.The Sound Fluctuations:
Again, in this day and age you would think the vocal editing could be a little tighter, but once more I found certain characters harder to hear over the others. For a film where dialogue is important, kind of making sure I can hear all characters is s little important for me and I would have made sure that all characters could be understood.More Explanation:
I know, A24 is all about making sure to make you think and reflect, and I can appreciate that to a wide level given more exposure to the movie genre like this. However, where the movie fails for me is the fact that it is so ambiguous, with many details left to go research on your own that the ambiguity became more frustrating and endearing for me. Again, the mom who started this mess held so many mysteries, and yet we got very little of her involvement in a direct focus, forced to use these fleeting shots to draw our own story. Other agent have the same sort of wide interpretation, and for viewers like me, a little more information and drive behind them would have made a big difference for my engagement in this film and perhaps opened it up to more audience members liking this approach. This is especially true for the ending, which once again is another drop off that A24 seems to thrive on in hopes of making you interpret your own ending.The Pace/Boredom:
My biggest complaint with the movie was the pacing of the film. Again, A24 pictures is all about taking extraordinary time and risks to tell a story, which is great in many regards. However, I'm also someone who likes for some things to liven the film up more and help break up the arduous amount of time from becoming boring to the point of inducing sleep. The Green Knight did not accomplish what Uncut Gems and Hereditary did for me, leaving me hoping for something to happen in this fantasy world. I did not need him to face a hundred orcs, I did not need some mystical dragon to challenge him in gallant fight of fire and steel, and I did not need him fighting serpents. However, a couple of other fun challenges or riddles, or something that was a little more traditional and energetic could have helped cut the boring fat up a bit and at least give Gawain a more entertaining challenge. The Fox alone could have provided so many of these challenges alone that would have helped evolve the relationship of the two.The VERDICT:
The Green Knight is certainly a display of cinematic quality that breaks the mold of the traditional film. With a plot centered around challenging the human character in a traditional role of the knight, and leaving you thinking of the conscious choices we make in life. With fantastic dialogue that is poetic and fitting of the visual style, The Green Knight's world will immerse you into this moral quest, feeling the weight of every decision in Gawain's search for the completion of his game. However, much like other productions of this company, the ambiguous artistic style is not going to be for everyone. I myself found that there were wasted character potential in this quest, lost opportunities to help expand a little more of the guides of Gawain to give some meaning and info to their inclusion. In addition, unlike several other works by their studio, this movie lacks the intrigue and excitement to break up the monotony of what this quest felt like so that I was not so bored by the ambiguity that they had. Overall, I appreciate a lot of the risks this movie takes, but it did not quite deliver the same punch that the other films have accomplished in their tenure. Based on this information, my scores for the film are:Adventure/Drama/Fantasy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5.",The Green Knight
31,Rob_Taylor,What did the fox say..?,3,24 August 2021,"So, hoping for an Arthurian tale with chivalry and maybe some action I decided to give this a shot on streaming. All I can say is, thank Christ I did not watch this in a cinema... there's no fast-forward there.The trailer is one of those misleading types that promise one thing that the film does not then deliver upon. In this case, it promised (as I mentioned above) and Arthurian tale of knights and chivalry. What I got was a dreary, boring slog with little to recommend it.After the first ten minutes, I came here, to IMDb, to see if I was being sold a pup. A rating of 6.9 greeted me. Suspicious, I delved into the comments and discovered the truth of the matter. It was indeed dull and boring.Curious as to whether the whole movie was like that, I decided to skip ahead incrementally until I found something interesting. I stopped once, upon seeing the fox character and tarried for a few moments. But even that was done in such a dull and lifeless manner that I quickly gave up.Needless to say, upon resuming the skipping, I soon reached the end of the film.Now, of course, I went back and watched sections of the film, curious to see if, at any point, it rose above the heavily-sedated mediocrity it seemed to have set for itself. It did not.Instead, what we have is an overly pretentious take on a classic arthurian legend that could not have been less engaging if it tried to be. There is almost no character development. There is very little attempt to pace the movie in anything like a normal manner. Places, people and story are sacrificed in this (and I'll use the term reluctantly...) art piece.David Lowery has written and directed this movie in such a way as to appeal to only those think an unmade bed is artistic. Sure, the cinematography is interesting in places, but the over-reliance on dully lit or foggy scenes often makes it hard to see what is going on. But that last is okay ,really, because there is nothing going on.All in all, an effort that has failed to do justice to the source material. Destined to be forgotten. Another of those movies you'll come across late at night, watch for a few minutes until you remember what it is and then go ""Oh!

35,bankofmarquis,Intriguing...Intelligent...and Weird,7,6 August 2021,"You have 2 choices when choosing to view the Arthurian tale THE GREEN KNIGHT.1). Brush up on the 14th Century tale (writer unknown) about Sir Gawain (of Knights of the Round Table fame) and The Green Knight2). Go in ""blind"" and let the film wash over you.I did #2 and while I got the ""gist"" of what was going on, I missed some of the subtleties (or the attempted subtleties) that I now know since I went on-line and brushed up on the story/poem (no, I did not read the 14th century poem - a google search synopsis of plot of the poem was sufficient).Starring Dev Patel (more on him later) THE GREEN KNIGHT tells the story of a would-be Knight of the Round Table, Gawain, who accepts a challenge of THE GREEN KNIGHT and now must stand up to the consequence of his deeds while heading off on a quest.Dev Patel (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE) has really grown into a fine actor and he is perfectly cast as the courage-challenged Gawain. He walks through this film with a slight look of fear in his eyes and I was finding myself yelling at him (in my head) to ""stand up and do what's right"" (which is the point of the film/story) when he would make the wrong decision.Alicia Vikander (who I have not seen on screen since 2018's TOMB RAIDER) and Joel Edgerton (LOVING) are 2 of the people that Gawain meets along the way and they bring strength and star power to the middle part of this film - they came along at an opportune time, for this film was beginning to sag under it's own weight at that point, but these 2 help propel Gawain (and the film) to the climax.Director David Lowery (A GHOST STORY) has crafted a fantastical film that reminded me very much of the work of Terry Gilliam - and I mean that as a compliment. He heightens every scene with imagery that's just ""off"" (again, I mean that as a compliment) that symbolizes the ""quest"" that Gawain is on.He also does something that will either encourage or discourage a viewer (and that is the strength and weakness of this film) - he explains nothing.For example...at the beginning, Gawain is sitting at a round table with a King and Queen and a bunch of other Knights (or would be Knights). One would assume that this is King Arthur, Guinevere and the Knights of the Round Table, but Lowery never calls them by name. ""The King"" pulls out his sword and hands it to Gawain for his contest with the Green Knight. The crowd reacts with gasps - one would assume that this is the fable sword Excaliber, but it is never stated.So...knowing these things (and some of the other aspects of the Gawain) story, might further enrich this experience, but Lowery chooses to not spoon feed the audience and since I did not really know the Gawain story, I just sat back and enjoyed the quest, the imagery, the weirdness (and there is some VERY weird moments - I still don't know what to make of the scene with the Giants) and was rewarded with a film experience that is rare nowadays, one that just unfurls without telescoping what is happening or what is to come.This film is not for everyone - it does have a rather languid pace to it - but for those of you that can sit in the stillness, marvel at the imagery and revel in the weirdness/unknown, then THE GREEN KNIGHT is, ultimately, a rewarding film experience - one that (now that I know the story) am eager to revisit.Letter Grade: B7 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Green Knight

Sure there were many mysterious creatures, but I couldn't figure out the significance. Also, the pace was quite slow at times, which again would negatively affect the viewing experience.However, as for cinematography, this gotta be one of the best this year. The director did a masterful job of setting up the immersive, fantastic, and surreal atmosphere with amazing angles, usage of lightning, and angelic scores. Despite how confusing the story could get, I was still in awe at the beauty that was on the screen. However, the movie took place a lot in the dark, and I couldn't see clearly what was on the screen.The character Garwain was interesting. It was pretty clear how his character would end up, but the movie had an unexpected way of showing his transformation. The ending was good, but it didn't make me feel as satisfied and elevated as I wanted because of how confusing his journey was.Overall, don't expect an intense or action-packed movie, but a slow, but immersive and beautifully crafted character study. 7.5/10.",The Green Knight
39,tm-sheehan,Even the talented cast can't turn this Straw into Gold,4,8 November 2021,"My Score 4/10. A Prime Video ProductionThis movie was so disappointing for me and I did wonder why it's gone to Streaming so early and already available on DVD /Blue Ray and got my answer tonight when we watched it.In my opinion it's not worthy of a Cinema release because it's boring , slow paced and so dark in its look on screen plus it's a script that any high school pupil could do better.David Lowery is promoted as a visionary film maker if ""The Green Knight"" is an indication of his vision he doesn't impress this cinema goer.The movie tells the story of Sir Gawain (Dev Patel), King Arthur's reckless and headstrong nephew, who embarks on a daring quest to confront the eponymous Green Knight.Some of the droll silly dialogue is almost funny and it's not meant to be ( there is not a jot of humour in this film) eg . One scene where Sir Gaiwain points out to a princess or Spirit ? That tells him she's lost her head he tells her no it's actually still attached to her neck , then he dives in to an enchanted lake to find it.There's lots of people losing their heads in this movie and I really think Dev Patel who I usually really admire lost his when he agreed to star in ""The Green Knight "".This story is based on the novel by JRR Tolkien titled Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with Pearl and Sir Orfeo I haven't read it and after seeing the movie I doubt if David Lowery the Director and Screenwriter has either?I don't enjoy being so negative about new movies I recall how Tom Hooper's film version of ""Cats"" was crucified by the critics and I thoroughly enjoyed his new concept and the talented cast.The Green Knight is certainly not getting the hostile treatment that ""Cats"" got and ""Cats"" again just my opinion is very entertaining compared to this 2hour 10 yawn fest.""The Green Knight ""cost $15 millionUSD estimated budget and hasn't done well at only a world box office taking of $18.9 million USD .I've said nothing about any of the performances because none of them even Dev Patel impressed me at all it's not their fault at all they can't be expected to do a Rumplestiltskin and turn ""Staw into Gold""",The Green Knight

41,msbreviews,The Green Knight is a slow-burn character study with some of the best visuals and sound work I've ever witnessed.,8,16 August 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""The Green Knight is a slow-burn character study with some of the best visuals and sound work I've ever witnessed. David Lowery delivers a thematically heavy, superbly structured narrative focused on the self-discovering journey of the flawed protagonist Sir Gawain. Dev Patel leads with an extraordinarily subtle, powerful performance, accompanied by an equally impressive supporting cast. Andrew Droz Palermo's stunning cinematography, Daniel Hart's atmosphere-setting score, and especially Johnny Marshall's impactful sound design deeply elevate the tremendous epic scope that this movie holds. However, some fantastical elements feel irrelevant, the lack of any sort of action deeply affects the snail-like pacing, and the execution of the ending ultimately leaves me feeling slightly underwhelmed, though admittedly caught by surprise. In the end, it's still an epic character piece that I highly recommend to any fantasy fan but beware of unrealistically high, action-based expectations.""Rating: B+",The Green Knight

It's filmed using the realistic light style - so you can't see anything. It's got a horrendously loud soundtrack so you can't hear anything.

Critics were right about the trippy and arresting visuals. Lowery crafted something aesthetically stunning out of a fairly simple and classic tale. But it IS a fairly simple tale...and 2 hours and 10 minutes felt like a real stretch. The plot was convoluted and poorly paced for a reason. So I guess the question is whether beautiful and haunting imagery is enough of an excuse to turn a 45 minute story into something 2.5 times longer than that.

48,ronakkotian,An encapsulating and visually breathtaking experience.,8,24 August 2021,"After a year long delay, I was finally able to watch David Lowery's The Green Knight and it was one of the best films of the year.The Green Knight follows Gawain, King Arthur's nephew, who goes on a journey to the Green Chapel to find the Green Knight.David Lowery is a director that understands the importance of visual storytelling as shown by his previous film, A Ghost Story. I had my issues with A Ghost Story but I was able to appreciate it more as time went by. The Green Knight, however, is probably his best film yet. Knowing David Lowery and A24 were behind this project, I expected this film to be more of a slow character study and that's exactly what The Green Knight was. Lowery's recreation of the medieval era is absolutely fantastic. From the production design to the costumes, they all contribute to making this world feel real. There are some absolutely stunning shots that capture the vast landscape of the world making it feel like a cinematic experience. Lowery also uses colour in an interesting way. Not only are they appealing to the eye but they clearly serve a purpose towards the film's story and protagonist, Gawain. I especially loved the use of green during the scenes involving the Green Knight. The actual look of the Green Knight is marvellous and Ralph Ineson's powerful voice makes this character have so much more of a brooding presence. The score by Daniel Hart is one of the film's biggest strengths. It adds an eerie and weird atmosphere alongside the grand visuals which I thought fit the tone perfectly and helped enhance the overall experience. My only issue would have to be some of the visual effects. There's a fox in the film and the visual effects for it didn't look that good in some of the close-up shots.Aside from the breathtaking visuals, what also encapsulated me was the way Lowery told this story. Like A Ghost Story, The Green Knight doesn't explicitly say what it's all about. A particular sequence towards the end is told entirely through its visuals without any dialogue and is a core element to the entire purpose of the film. Lowery evidently wants the audience to pick up on certain clues he's hidden and interpret based on what they find which is what I like to do with a film. I see Gawain's journey as a test of honour and chivalry which are elements that make up a good knight. There are many details hidden throughout where people can take away multiple interpretations and that's what makes David Lowery such a brilliant visionary.Lowery has built up a strong cast of talented actors, all of which deliver stellar performances. Dev Patel gives one of his best as Gawain. I didn't expect to see him do a role like this but he managed to make it work. Alicia Vikander is also terrific as the two characters she plays. Sean Harris, Kate Dickie and Barry Keoghan aren't in the film much but they all do a commendable job. Joel Edgerton also puts forth a strong performance and Ralph Ineson captures the mighty aura of the Green Knight very well.David Lowery has managed to impress me again with his version of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Along with the mesmerising visuals, Lowery's method of visual storytelling kept me engaged and wanting to analyse it on a deeper level. This film isn't for everyone but if you would like a thought-provoking experience, I would highly recommend The Green Knight.",The Green Knight
49,sweidman-28016,A Detailed Epic Like No Other,9,30 July 2021,"""Oh greatest of Kings, let one of your Knights try to land a blow against me. Indulge me in this game.""I just saw this and had to write a review immediately which hasn't happened to me in a long while. The Green Knight is an epic fantasy adventure based on the timeless Arthurian legend. It tells the story of Sir Gawain, King Arthur's reckless and headstrong nephew, who embarks on a daring quest to confront the eponymous Green Knight, a gigantic emerald-skinned stranger and tester of men. Gawain contends with ghosts, giants, thieves, and schemers in what becomes a deeper journey to define his character and prove his worth in the eyes of his family and kingdom by facing the ultimate challenger. Back in 2017, David Lowery presented us with the heartbreaking masterpiece A Ghost Story. You don't have to see the film (though I highly highly recommend doing so), but just knowing he was attached to that film should bring some anticipation for The Green Knight. I've been anticipating it ever since it was announced. Not just for the story and director, but also it's another A24 project and they've never done something like this so I wanted to see the outcome. This film is breathtaking. My god is it dripping with direction! David Lowery really knew what he was doing with this. He has everything so perfectly placed in the frame to convey the emotion and story needed. It's a visual feast. The cinematography by Andrew Droz Palermo is the best we've seen all year. Lighting is a key aspect to it and it's like watching a light show happening on screen. The colors are bold pairing up with the themes and mood of what's happening on screen. Every shot is filled with detail. But that's what Lowery was looking for. The production design is absolutely stellar. It's beautiful to look at in every aspect. And the costumes are incredibly intricate. I'd just like to mention what a year it has and will be for costumes in film. Like I said, everything is precise.Lowery needed to right lead to portray Sir Gawain and further the story. Dev Patel has yet to give a less than decent performance, and this ranks with some of his best work. The film is a character study, so his acting isn't over the top in any way. It's fairly subtle and refined. They gathered a fine array of actors to create an ensemble like no other. With the likeness of Alicia Vikander, Barry Keoghan, and Ralph Ineson among others, it's hard not to find an actor let alone character to dislike. I mention those three because even with their short screen time, they are up every second. And Ralph Ineson may only have a few minutes of screen time total, but he portrays the Green Knight with such physicality and believability. He's caked in makeup, extraordinary makeup I shall add, and you have to remind yourself that's a living, breathing person acting under all of that. He may look like a tree and his character is complex, but that's someone acting! When it comes to story, this is told in a slow manner. It's not worried about epic fight scenes or quick-cut editing (also the editing is amazing). The film takes its time to squeeze out every bit of story, symbolism, and everything it has to offer. And some might find the nature of it that makes you sit and think not worth it or overbearing for a story like this, but I found it remarkable. A few times it got slightly lost in the pacing, but always ended up finding its way. There's so much to gain from it in the end, and all of it is rewarding. Speaking of ending, there's a prolonged ending sequences that's just mind-boggling at how well crafted it is. All the stars aligned and a real piece of art was made within those few minutes. Anyway, Daniel Hart composes the score again for Lowery. Those two have an understanding because every score he makes for him is just so pleasing (his best being A Ghost Story once again). It has the classic Arthurian sound you'd expect with a hauntingly beautifulness to it. My point is I could keep going on and on about The Green Knight and all it has to offer. But my main takeaway is that you should seek this out, just like I will at least one more time. It's going to be one of those films where with each watch there will be more to gained for like it even more.",The Green Knight

Aside from the riveting final meeting, even those are hard to engage with in the moment (the visuals are great but the bizarre symbolism and plot movements are hard to wrap your head around), but looking back, it's impossible not to appreciate the poetic artistry of it all, from its thought-provoking take on the classic ""hero's quest"" story arc to its almost playful engagement with themes of time and honour.7.5/10.",The Green Knight

Gray and brown with a splash of green.This feels like one of those legends that get passed by and are hazy in the details. More interesting than reality would be. The uncertainty it brings, but the straightforwardness.. it's very welcome. And so are the elements that make up it's narrative. An approach to mystery and magic that's quite rare. Definitely not your common movie, but is that alone enough to warrant a watch?Sadly, it was not for me. It's a bit hollow and slow, and it doesn't go far enough. I would have liked more.. Be it lore, dialogue, world-building, development, wonderment. I like stories to be crafted in their entirety, or to be wowed and excited.In the end, I was reminded of the story from Bloodborne.. which is leagues more intense, the music quite similar and the feeling it gave as well.

54,kgprophet,NOT a Summer Action Movie,6,4 August 2021,"Many times I like to go into a movie without knowing much about it. It allows me to be open minded with no preconceptions of what I will be watching. The primary reason I wanted to see this well rated movie was the striking cinematography. If one was to see a film mostly for the look of the film, you should see it on a nice big screen. Thank god I went to see this film during the opening week, while it was on a decent screen. The cinematography style makes use of the darkness. If I tried to watch it on a darker screen, it would have been almost unwatchable. Similar to the heavy shadow style of cinematography in ""Mank"", you still were able to see the faces, ever so faintly, in the shadows.One thing that struck me the most was this film was released as a summer movie. With fantasy elements and a King Arthur legend, you would expect some action scenes. Some swordplay perhaps, or other battle scenes. Instead designed to be an anti-summer movie, it tries it's best to defy expectations in almost every respect. From the pacing, to the lack of action, to twisting expectations, to the occasional humour, this is not another Marvel movie. So I am a little disappointed specifically because it was lumped in with other summer releases.This film would have fit much better as a fall or winter release. The film itself has significant events centered around Christmas. Expectations would not be so high, and it's understated qualities could be better appreciated. As for the alternative telling of the King Arthur legend, it certainly finds ways to become mystical, or funny, or serious, or sedentary (lingering long shots). It's just that I was hoping for those big summer blockbuster scenes. There is some CGI to be had. Scene extensions, modern building removal (likely), and an animated fox. The rest of the magic comes from creative production design and cinematography.With the slow pacing, the emotional impact of some scenes are drawn out. Sorry to say, modern movie audiences have become accustomed to shorthand emotional beats, and it becomes uncomfortable when a dramatic moment lingers in the air. Nevertheless, the decent sized audience at the showing I went to seemed to enjoy it. (No walkouts). No one would complain about the casting or the acting. The tone of the film is mostly consistent, with perhaps a moment here or there when the director may try to get a little too 'artsy"".I give it 6 out of 10 stars. Those who appreciate the art of filmmaking should see it on the big screen. Those looking for swordplay and action style pacing should avoid it.",The Green Knight
55,DeBBss,A pretentious shell of a film,4,20 August 2021,"I think this movie cares too much about its visuals rather than its story. This film is great from a cinematic standpoint, but it lacks a story that's entertaining or meaningful. This film felt so incredibly pretentious because it cared more about long shots than a plot that actually holds value. And paired with its extremely slow pacing, it makes sense why this film wouldn't be enjoyable. I assume people came for an adventurous, simplistic knight tale, but it's just one long hollow art piece.This film is also unnecessarily confusing. It explains literally nothing, and of course it had to have an ambiguous ending. I swear, too many films think they're smart because they have an ambiguous ending, but it just comes off unnecessary and even more pretentious. I guess the only good thing about this movie is the acting. And although this movie has good acting, it still doesn't matter because this film is emotionless and bland.I was so excited to watch The Green Knight, thinking it was going to be the best movie of this dull year. Unfortunately, this movie has an expressive shell, but is ultimately hollow. This isn't the worst movie of the year, but it certainly is one of the most boring. I'd give it a hard pass to anyone who even considers watching this; it's a 2 hour modern art piece.",The Green Knight

58,flingebunt,Trippy but basically boring telling of a boring story,5,5 September 2021,"The Green Knight or Green Man is part of English folklore, and of course turns up to make his contribution to the Arthurian legend. It is a simple folk tale that would have different variations befitting an oral tradition.. People who think that making a movie requires that it follow one version, the 14th century poem, faithfully are not being faithful to the story.So this movie tries to fill in a folk tale that can be told in 20 minutes with trippy visual imagery and unsettling music.So what it does right is good. The look and feel of the movie is consistent. Even things like only focusing on characters of the narrative while others fade into the background.What it does wrong, will depend on what you which bits you like or don't like. But ultimately the visual poetry reduces the nature of the characters to cyphers.What does it all mean? Well that is up to you. Is it worth seeing?

61,ayoreinf,How does one mix fantasy and hyper realizm,8,9 August 2021,"The main fault of this movie is that it expect all its viewers to know the tale it's based on. Without knowing the original story it's next to impossible to make full sense of the movie itself. On the other hand, nowadays it's possible to find an abridged version of the story or even the full Tolkien translation on the net, like I did. Then one can see what changes David Lowery made to the original story and figure out his intentions.Here comes the main change Lowery made - he completely changed the character of the literary Sir Gawain and I think that's the reason he chose Dev Patel to play the lead - it's as if he states that's not the Sir Gawain you know from the story - this is my version of Sir Gawain not the Sir Gawain of the original story. This is not the reckless and headstrong knight of the story this is the king's young nephew, who doesn't know what he wants to be when he grows up, in fact he doesn't even want to grow up. He prefers to keep on foolling around and making no commitment to anything and anyone. Once this change is made to the story the entire point is different - this no longer a story of a young knight proving his valor but rather a story of a young man learning about growing up altogether.Here comes my second point - because of this change it was much more important to make the whole story look as real as possible. It's a story of magic and fantasy but it's designed to look as if we're watching it exactly as it took place at the days of King Arthur and it's done superbly the lighting the setting every little detail is made to look as real as modern movies can make it look. Because it's no longer an epos it's a real story of a young man coming of age. So David Lowery takes some liberty where the original story allows it - elaborating on the journey and the troubles Gawain has faced during that journey and do remember this is his version of Gawain not the young knight of the original story so the journey shows us a young man not sure about who he is and whether he wants this journey at allSo - bottom line is once you do know the original story and you do realize the point Lowery is making in this film - this is one clever and beautifully designed movie - it simply demands a little bit of extra effort from us viewers.",The Green Knight
62,darkreignn,One of the best movies of 2021,9,1 August 2021,"""The Green Knight"" took me completely by surprise, spanking both my cheeks when I didn't expect it - I mean this in the best way possible. As an avid A24 film viewer, I went to watch this movie as soon as it was released in theaters. With rave reviews from critics, and mediocre reviews from audiences (it is currently at a 54% audience score at Rotten Tomatoes), I lowered my expectations. And to be quite honest with you, I shouldn't have. From the jump, ""The Green Knight"" screams quality; from the cinematography, to the directing, to the performances and musical score, everything in this movie has been crafted to perfection.David Lowery and crew were meticulous in creating a fantasy medieval world that you'll want to find yourself absorbed in. Make no mistake - this isn't an action movie. But the visuals, soundtrack, and performances all blend together excellently to formulate a world that is as exciting as one you'd expect in an action-fantasy film. I'm telling you, the look and sound of this movie are enough to get your blood pumping - even when nothing is necessarily ""happening,"" Lowery manages you utilize fantastic cinematography and visual motifs, interconnected with euphoric music, that constantly push the movie forward, all the while constantly drenching this film in pure fantasy attire. Besides ""The Lord of the Rings"" and, to a lesser extent, ""The Hobbit,"" I haven't seen a movie that looks this good, with such tenacity and skill both in front of and behind the camera, while still being 100% committed to providing the inescapable and undeniable air of adventure and fantasy. And this pure visual skill, accompanied by the incredible music, manages to add intensity and watchability to the movie, even when nothing necessarily intense is happening on screen.To put it simply, this is the type of look, feel, and sound I want in a fantasy movie - but in the end, it wouldn't mean anything if the performances and story sucked; well, I have some great news for you - they don't. ""The Green Knight"" has a simple and fairly straightforward story, if one that you may have to do some reading about to clear up when the credits roll. Sure, not everything is explained in perfect black and white, but that's part of the fun of the film. ""The Green Knight"" doesn't treat its audience like idiots; instead, it empowers its viewers to figure things out on their own. And, if you're a patient viewer, and perhaps one that is well-versed in Arthurian legends, you'll start to realize that every single thing that happens on screen has meaning and thematic resonance. Plus, the excellent and deeply committed performances by all involved elevate every scene in this movie to heights they had no business being elevated to.With its visual flair, dramatic undertone, and fantastical scope, ""The Green Knight"" was also one of the most emotionally resonant movies I've seen in theaters in quite awhile. If you're anything like me and enjoy drinking wine and chasing women, you'll immediately relate to Dev Patel's Gawain - in that same vein, if you've ever wished you had an opportunity to chase something greater and make a name for yourself, you will certainly relate to Gawain, and even begin to bond with him as he embarks on his journey to face the legendary Green Knight. I could deeply relate to Gawain's desire to prove himself to men he thought were above him, and as he faced certain moral quandaries on his adventure, I also found myself wondering what exactly I would do if I were in his shoes. It's these moral dilemmas the film poses that add to the drama - ""The Green Knight"" opts for more silent challenges than violent ones, and I found that choice to be all the more riveting.Sure, ""The Green Knight"" may be an art film, and it may be a slow burn, but it's certainly not a boring movie. Truth be told, it is a touch too long - you can really start to feel its length in the final 30 minutes; that said, the final 30 minutes contain some of the best sequences of the film, complete with a perfectly satisfying ending (and stay tuned for the after credits scene). I would recommend this movie to all lovers of fantasy, art cinema, and those who enjoy watching pure feasts for the eyes and ears. However, if you aren't a fan of slow burns, there's no shame in skipping this one. ""The Green Knight"" is a long, perhaps even drawn out, medieval drama; that said, it's also a long, drawn out medieval drama that contains some of the most memorable sequences and performances I've seen in a movie all year. And personally, I can't wait for this movie to come out on Blu-Ray so I can watch it again.",The Green Knight

66,digdog-785-717538,incredibly pretentious bait for pretentious reviewers,5,23 August 2021,"The Green Knight is NOT anything that you may have read. It's not a clever deconstruction of the source material. It is NOT a mystical voyage of self-discovery.What is is, is a collection of visuals and sounds stripped as far as possible of any relatable content, to allow pretentious people to make up any mening for them that suits their pompousness.To normal human beings, it has zero meaning.While this film is not completely worthless, the very arrogance of its existence forces me to warn you against watching it. You probably will not like it, but that would be the best of the two results. God forbid that you actually like this, because that is what The Green Knight wants you to do - to convince yourself that you are watching a grandiose piece full of intellectual genius, while at the same time the film ditches any responsibility it has of telling an intelligible story - along with any common filmmaking tools, such as pacing, meaningful dialogue, character development, and so forth.My vote: do not watch/10.",The Green Knight
67,TheVictoriousV,"I need a minute, and then some",10,15 August 2021,"David Lowery is certain to be remembered as one of the most uniquely brilliant filmmakers of this generation. He artfully transcended space and time with 2017's A Ghost Story (one of my absolute favorites of the decade) and supplied appealing Fantasy visuals with Pete's Dragon the year before. With The Green Knight, both worlds meet (arthouse and fairy-tale Fantasy), resulting in one of the most transporting versions of the Arthurian legends that I've ever seen -- and one of the most defiant.Dev Patel, in his most striking performance since 2016's Lion, plays this film's version of Sir Gawain (known as Gwalchmai ap Gwyar in the early Welsh stories), and I gather that some people take issue with the race bending. The film's ""explanation"", I guess, is that Morgaine the witch (Gawain's mother) had the appearance of Sarita Choudhury. Do you really care? Remember when people just watched movies?Based on the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the film is highly unconventional; more visual and atmospheric than story-driven -- a series of increasingly dreamlike stops across the enchanted, sometimes cursed vistas of medieval Britain. There is much to figure out, on a purely textual level (the in-universe significance of Alicia Vikander playing two different characters; the cryptic warnings from the Fox...) and a thematic level (what the film might be saying about knighthood, heroism, male self-actualization, and the violent, futile pursuits of immortalization in general).Nowadays, it is rare to say that VFX characters constitute one of the best things in the movie, but this rings true of the titular Green Knight, who appears in King Arthur's court one Christmas to start a game with Gawain that shall be finished ""one year hence"". Whenever we see him, or any of the pale colossi Gawain comes across on the misty mountain, there is a tangible feeling of ineffability; that there are forces in this world so far removed from humans (many of them going about their day around Camelot, blissfully heedless of what lies beyond) that we feel both humbled and afraid.This palpable atmosphere consumes us right from the opening shots, aided by languid camera work that lets everything sink in. Brian Tallerico wrote, rightfully, that one can immediately ""feel the chill and smell the air"" -- he also compared the rest of the film's structure to that of the poetry it adapts, likening the scenes, or ""episodes"", to stanzas.Weirdly, I'm also compelled to make comparisons to The Suicide Squad, which strangely possessed a somewhat grounded visual appearance (thanks to shabby suits, a decent amount of practical effects, as well as documentary-like camera work) that made the actually grand and impressive images all the more impressive. The Green Knight is naturally lit (all scenes, with some highly deliberate exceptions, are illuminated by candles, torches, and sunlight) and not overly fancy in its battle sequences. In a way, this makes us believe what we see, including the eventual creatures from the other side. Through these filmmaking choices, Lowery makes even the simplest visual (a levitating young woman; a house that seems to fade in and out of existence; the Green Knight opening his eyes...) into a most chilling sight. This is what film can do for our old folk tales.The actors all do a fine job and even the most mystifying characters leave an impression (some of Gawain's encounters seem random, but I trust I'm only a few more viewings away from seeing the big picture). Sean Harris and Kate Dickie play weathered versions of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere, respectively; Joel Edgerton portrays a strange lord who offers Gawain many gifts; Barry Keoghan is a scheming trickster, and Erin Kellyman is the upset spirit of Winifred. Ralph Ineson voices the Green Knight, and what a voice it is.Last but not least, my praise goes to the music by Daniel Hart, fitting the images with clockwork-precision the likes of which you'll never see in some big-studio action romp. Though I could most likely write about The Green Knight for several more pages, I feel I kinda need to just think about it for a while -- while accompanied by Hart's haunting compositions, of course.I now predict that this movie year will be a repetition of 2017, at least in the sense that David Lowery and Denis Villeneuve will dominate the Top 10 list for me (I named Blade Runner 2049 and A Ghost Story the two greatest films of '17). If my favorite movies of 2021 don't wind up being this and the Dune remake, I shall be very surprised. I was reminded of other greats from that year; Keoghan and Edgerton give their best performances since The Killing of a Sacred Deer and It Comes at Night, respectively, and ""looks natural but grows increasingly surreal and nightmarish"" is a description that also fits Aronofsky's Mother. Basically, I have high hopes for the post-COVID age of movies.SIDE NOTE: For me personally, this film was also a worthwhile return to actual movie theaters and definitely a worthy inauguration of my hometown's new multiplex, which is larger and certainly more ""cinematic"" in its furnishing than the last one. For both myself and my companion, this marked the first big-screen film experience since we saw Color Out of Space at the arthouse theatre last February. This one didn't have alcohol, unfortunately, but it did have comfy chairs.",The Green Knight
68,namob-43673,"All of the critique, both plus and minus, is correct...",6,3 August 2021,"This is a very, very hard movie to rate and critique.Why?Because it is beautiful, amazingly acted, have fantastic music and is based on one of my favourite poems. BUT this is also complete nonsens, it is so boring I almost fell asleep and the story is not good enough. How do you rate something like that? I get why mainstream critics love this and if all you care about is how lovely things look with beautiful music and how wonderfully acted every character is, then this is basically a 10/10.On the other hand if you care about story, moving the plot forward, action, and character development... well, tough, this is not for you. The worst thing about this movie though is how it is treating the source material; as a joke! I've seldom seen less understanding of a source material. Did they even read it? Did no producer or show runner go; hold on for a moment...I do not really know what to feel to be honest. I liked the movie, but it was nothing what I expected and I feel they could have done better with the story which, at the end of the day, is what I care the most about. If the story does not do it, then the movie fails no matter what the rest say or do. And this is also the main reason for my 6/10. This is a gorgeous movie and some of the acting is Oscars worthy for sure, but if you cannot tell the story properly and if you cannot engage the audience then the movie is still not a success in my book. I cannot believe I am going to say this, I feel dirty saying it, but this movie could have used a bit more Hollywood-ness! Even throwing in an explosion or two would have made a difference... At least some swinging action more to engage a bit.OR, develop the story one or two more steps. Either of these options would have made this movie better.But, again, the lack of respect for the source material is probably the biggest negative.I give this movie a very generous 6/10. This is by no means a horrible turd of a movie, anyone claiming that did not see it. But this is also not a masterpiece as some ludicrous people claim. Give it cred for what it does good, and give it hell for what it fails on. Whatever is most important for you will also impact what you feel about this movie. For me this is a well crafted movie that misses the mark and could have been so much better hence the 6/10. This will probably win some awards, but it will not deserve it...
Despite the average score, I will still not recommend it - because of how they treat the source material.",The Green Knight

The camerawork is very well done and there is no shaky cam garbage in this film, thankfully.The music is excellent and accompanies the visuals very well. The acting gets the job done though nothing breathtaking.It is a tale of fear, I imagine, and other things interwoven into the subtext. But I think it merits more watches to figure out what this movie is really about.It is a long film, and some will find it slow. However this is something to be enjoyed; it has some creepy parts, some ghosts, some magic and some witchcraft, though not too much action in this one.

73,nidhunmoviebuff,Dev Patel captivates in this mystical fantasy drama,7,25 August 2021,"Dev Patel stars in David Lowery's powerful retelling of the legendary Arthurian poem 'Sir Gawarin and the Green Knight', with mystical and wondrous elements galore.He plays the much-adored 'Gawain', a member of the fabled Arthur's Round Table and begins his journey as an aspiring knight at the start of the story. He picks up a challenge with the magical 'Green Knight' and must embark on a tortuous quest to claim the honor that he has craved all his life.On this perilous journey he encounters bandits, giants and other manners of mythical beings while constantly being tested for his chivalry and virtue. The spiritual and pragmatic symbolisms the original poem is know for is wonderfully interpreted and sometimes, even turned on its head by the director.Dev Patel delivers one of his career's best performances as the tormented, ambitious wannabe knight who has to constantly battle his demons at every step. Alicia Vikander is electric in a double role while Joel Edgerton captivates in a short but impactful appearance.The best part of the film is that director David Lowery never tries to spoon-feed you his take on the moral and ethical dilemmas the knight faces but leaves it to us. The audience for interpretation.The Green Knight is not for everyone but if you are into mind-bending fantasies filled with mystic elements, this might interest you.Recommended!",The Green Knight
74,TuesdayThe17th,Such a Lowery film. Feel it deeply.,10,13 October 2021,"A young and tattered upcoming knight, sir gaiwan, ventures into the never ending forest on a mission to find the green knight after challenged to play a ""game"" with him at Christmas time one year earlier. The rules were simple enough. The green knight challenged gaiwan to a duel where the two would fight and whatever blows were given by gaiwan would be reciprocated a calendar year later. Aware of said rules, Gaiwan hacks off the green knights head in the presence of his whole village in a prideful and haute type way. The Green Knight is then revealed as some sort of supernatural being as he reanimates, gathers his head and horse, and trots away laughing. Over the next year, Gaiwan is reluctantly awaiting Christmas time again for he fears his interaction with The Green Knight was more than just a ""game"". He sets out to meet The Green Knight at the chapel, days away, to uphold his end of the deal and also because he just needs to see to the end of this ""game"" himself. Gaiwan is worried. But he knows he has to be brave...The journey to the chapel is filled with everything fantastical to the brim but in such a moving way. This is not a horror film but it definitely has the elements of a horror film. This is what id call a haunting drama even if it's a medieval fantasy story.Lowery treats us to his signature time lapse montage in the final 20 minutes of the film and it's nothing short of breathtaking as we see a life unfold but is shrouded by uncertainty and worry that whatever is coming for him is inevitable..This movie plays out like a dream like scary story like the one story about the girl with the ribbon tied around her neck but won't take it off until her wedding day, revealing something truly sinister to her husband.You'll notice I left a lot out of this review and skipped over the climax of the film.If you are a fan of artsy or David Lowery, go see for yourself how this story plays out

76,sirwillisiv,A brilliant puzzle...,10,3 August 2021,"If you're going into The Green Knight expecting an action-heavy fantasy, you're sorely mistaken. This film is NOT a casual viewing. It's an artful, multilayered and thought-provoking puzzle for viewers craving a composite tale. The payoff after all the nuances are pieced together; it's exceptionally grim, it's oddly soothing and it's all around brilliant. I never read the 14th century poem the film is based on - I'm curious how many of us have - therefore I can't vouch if this interpretation is faithful but I believe director David Lowery hit on something amazing here.The Green Knight is a story about honor and the misery that befalls someone (and others) if they don't live up to their deeds. Carefully crafted, exceedingly deep and with engaging performances to boot. The film doesn't talk down to you. It gives you just the right amount of clues to work with. A visual powerhouse, The Green Knight bears one of the best medieval settings I've seen on screen. From shadowy castles to muddy plains and foggy forests, The Green Knight is absolutely dripping with inviting atmosphere and colors, plus the scope - for an independently funded picture - is breathtaking to witness. I'm serious in that the production design could rival visuals from the big budget crowd. It experiments with different palettes and never gets boring to look at. That's ultimately what helped me power through what could be perceived by others as a ""slog.""While I personally think The Green Knight is outstanding from all outward appearances, I understand these types of films aren't for everyone. General audiences typically don't like to be challenged and just want to turn their brains off to a fun movie. I respect that, sometimes I like to kick back and see some action and one-liners get tossed around, too. Though, often I want to change gear and absorb a complex story ripe for thoughtful discussion. Just because you don't understand the narrative doesn't mean the film's objectively bad. I mean, just LOOK at it. Even if the story doesn't grab you, you can't deny that it looks absolutely enchanting and I predict some kind of value will come out of it. To each their own, though. I highly recommend The Green Knight but you must know what you're getting into and prepare to think. The results may surprise you. It certainly blew me away once it all aligned.

The slow pacing allows the visuals and narrative to unfold in their own time, producing a thick atmosphere of brutality and bravery.

86,gcsman,"Step into a world of allegory and myth, and don't expect everything to make sense",8,7 August 2021,"The Green Knight is not your run-of-the-mill Arthurian swords-and-battles adventure. It belongs to an entirely different and much rarer genre -- something like Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal and other philosophical films filled with allegory and myth. (Another one I like very much for its humanity and warm heart is Joe Versus the Volcano, believe it or not.) But the Arthurian world is so diverse and has so much historical legend and literature behind it, that it can support a film like this just fine. This one is very much worth seeing -- just expect that when it's over, you'll be scratching your head over a whole slew of things. But that's what powerful allegory is like. It's under no compulsion to explain itself all that directly, and it takes a different, non-rational route directly into your brain.The plot, such as it is, derives mainly from the medieval fantasy tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, a story written at a time when the central spine of the Arthurian story was already established -- Camelot, the knights of the round table, the Grail, the connections to Christian mythology, and so on. Young Gawain (Dev Patel), Arthur's nephew, has ambition and bravado but he makes a foolish choice to accept the sudden challenge from the mysterious Green Knight, who appears out of nowhere. But he feels honor-bound to follow up on it. Off he goes to find his fate on Christmas Day at the Green Chapel, not even knowing exactly where it is. Of course, it's really a journey of self-discovery. Gawain is not a bad sort, but he's got a lot to learn about the nature of kindness, discretion, intelligent choices, and courage. Just as in the poem, he doesn't entirely succeed, but that too is part of real life. Incidentally, the old poem has a very readable translation done by none other than JRR Tolkien -- which I went and read after seeing the movie. It helped.However, director David Lowery and the production team use the source poem only as a springboard. If you find Lowery's interview with Vanity Fair, you can read about all the additions they did to the story, along with some serious changes in tone. But they have obviously put a lot of thought and design behind this whole thing. It's meticulously set in an ancient medieval world of hardscrabble farms and small, drafty castles, and yet in its own context it already has its own ancient history, marked by the many small ruins of previous centuries long past. Arthur himself (Sean Harris) and his knights are old and fading, their glory years past. They look to Gawain to provide a new spark.But as soon as Gawain leaves this very ordinary world on his mission, he encounters events that in a sensible world can't happen. On his long journey on horseback and foot, he wanders across blasted landscapes under foreboding skies, to meet an increasingly strange succession of characters who all seem to be there to tempt him off the right path: a young noblewoman who may or may not be a ghost seeking her head (don't ask --), a guide who is a fox, primeval giants looming in the mist, finally a castle in which the lord and lady, and an enigmatic old crone in a blindfold, play a final round of mind games with him. Significantly (though I'm still not completely sure just what it means), the lady of the castle is a version of his beloved peasant girlfriend Essel (Alicia Vikander, playing dual roles). This last section is the major part of the original story.I'd like to particularly mention the lighting of almost every scene, which seems just as carefully thought out as every other part of the production. Much of it is dark or grey, but changes surprisingly into vivid reds and greens at critical stages. It's not that fast-moving -- we often have plenty of time to let a scene soak in without the interruption of dialog -- and I take it that that's part of the point.What does it all mean? I guess David Lowery knows, but he seems happy not to lay out everything for us on a platter, and his worldview isn't all that happy a one. Some messages that I *think* are in the story: (1) Temptation and misfortune are opportunities, (2) Think very carefully before beheading someone (!), (3) Maybe the thing you were seeking is already at home, (4) We humans are all damaged. Be forgiving.Watching this, I couldn't help being reminded of the deathless line from Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) that ""Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords are not a sound basis of government"". I liked The Green Knight, but my favorite Arthurian movie is still Excalibur (1981), a terrific speed-through of the mainstream story told with total conviction and a great cast.",The Green Knight

89,Spartan_1_1_7,An Interesting Experience. Certainly a breath of fresh air amongst the usual stuff that is being put out.,7,13 October 2021,"This was a film I was excited to get to. I remember watching the trailer when it came out and being in awe of it. Felt like something right up my alley and something with an air of freshness around it, relatively. Having watched it, it wasn't on the level I was expecting it to be in terms of the overall entertainment value, hence a bit disappointing but, at the same time, it still was an interesting experience.The Green Knight is a medieval fantasy based on an Arthurian tale about Gawain, nephew to The King, who gets involved in a challenge with the green fellow and must go on a journey where his values are tested. Dev Patel as Gawain as well as most of the cast did a solid job, the performances were well enough.The story was a captivating experience with a lot of symbolism involved, some of it I probably got and some of it I probably didn't, as the protagonist goes through his trials and tribulations. The Knighthood and honour being tested, chivalry and loyalty on the line, the cost of lying and doubt, being in the cyclic nature of... nature, all good stuff shrouded under a dark tone. The ending, in particular, was the strongest part of the film which cemented the entire experience in a strong way and left me coming out of the film in a satisfied manner, loved it a lot.The experience is elevated due to riveting cinematography that truly hooks you in and transports you to another world accompanied by a great execution of mixing sets with CGI (save for a scene or two) as well as the eerily beautiful soundtrack that sets the tone properly. On a technical level, this film is strong.What brought down the film a few notches was the lack of characterization as opposed to other elements. In particular, there wasn't a whole lot of engaging dialogue that made you care for the characters beyond the superficial level, including the protagonist. Having watched it twice, the film sorely needed more dialogue/interactions, and not just the dour nihilistic kind, to build up the characters. The journey also felt short and I was expecting more events to take place even if there were creative and trippy occurrences along the way.Overall, this was an intriguing watch, something that certainly makes you ponder. I kinda wish I hadn't seen the trailer and went in completely blind. There's a bit of disappointment overall for me but that didn't stop it from being a good time. If you have an interest in the fantasy genre, or medieval stuff, and want something relatively unique, then I highly recommend giving this film a try. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 7.8/10.",The Green Knight

100,justinwfirestone,I snoozed a bit through this snoozefest,5,3 August 2021,"Faced with the difficult question of whether I enjoyed The Green Knight, I had to pause, reflect, consider, and unceremoniously respond with a tersely cogent ""no."" It is not a bad movie, simply another movie, a movie where a hero, or arguably non-hero, ventures forth northward to earn fame via questing, maybe levelling up once or twice along the way, maybe enduring fantastical situations or discovering Christmas Day is not always filled with the fun of opening presents or eating ham or decorating an anachronistic tree.It could have been unfamiliarity with the source material, but more likely it was a nagging lack of interest in any of the characters combined with apathy towards their relative amounts of success achieved. It is a bad sign when you kind-of hope the hero or non-hero rides off a cliff some point in the early second hour if for no other reason that it leaves enough time to sneak into another movie and not miss too much.The plot smacked a bit of an obfuscated remake of The Last Temptation of Christ, yet managed to avoid blasphemous controversy by means of going through the proper motions, riding horses through forests, and a lopping of a few heads. There will be other movies made, and The Green Knight is a shining example of what happens when people make more movies.",The Green Knight
101,theredsky,The Green Knight Review,8,4 August 2021,"The Green Knight is a perfect example of A24's consistent quality. This is one of the lowest 3 films on my A24 ranking list yet it's still a great film and one of the best films of 2021. Dev Patel gives his best performance here and one of the best performances of the year. His character is an engaging look to see what it means like to be worthy to the eyes of others. His interactions with other characters is great due to the stellar supporting performances and writing. The sequence with Joel Edgerton is fantastic as it shows Patel's vulnerability and shows that he is only human too. Sean Harris also gives a great supporting performance as the King. The best supporting performance by far though as Ralph Ineson as The Green Knight. His initial presence is mysterious and creepy as we see he can't die but his appearance at the end of the film is more friendly like. They are respectful to each other and act like they have known each other for a long time which is an interesting dynamic. The film really excels in its technical category. Every aspect of the production from the cinematography, editing, makeup, and costumes is absolutely phenomenal. The camerawork is outstanding and has the best location filming and cinematography of the entire year along with some amazing make up and costumes that feel authentic to the time period. The visual effects for the most part are pretty great with some sketchy moments here and there. The reason this isn't very high on my A24 Ranking is because the pacing can feel a little awkward sometimes and it doesn't have a major thought provoking attitude that the best A24 films like The Lighthouse and Midsommar have. I would definitely recommend checking this film out if you want something more experimental and slow.",The Green Knight
102,Rino_Bortone,AN EXTRAORDINARY WELL-CRAFTED VISION,8,15 October 2021,"David Lowery gives us a substantial vision, like a greedy cornucopia, where after the first taste, it continues unabated.

104,martinpersson97,A masterful take om classic legends,10,17 August 2021,"This movie, by the great David Lowery, takes fantasy and adventure movies to a whole other level.Inspired by Shakespearean and Arthurian legends, it's shot and written in a very unique way. Dividing it into book chapters and using a rather old style theatrical language, it truly feels like part of an epic legend.Whilst it pays homage to the classic legends, it also manages to give its own take on things - showcasing the human frailities. The actors, especially Dev Patel all do a fantastic job. Making a balance between theatrical and human sounds like a hard job, yet Lowery does it gracefully.The effects are incredible, and the world feels very alive. The movie has been said to be inspired by Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, which defiently shows - but I would also liken it to The Lord of the Rings, it truly feels like that kind of epic.Unlike most lighthearted adventure stories, there is not much humour in the story at all - it takes itself very seriously and has a pretty bleak tone reminiscent of the times it tries to replicate.Overall, this movie both follows and breaks tradition in ways that could fail miserably, yet works perfect in this case, providing a masterpiece and one of the best movies of 2021.",The Green Knight
105,jaimemedina-36288,A complete mess,4,15 October 2021,The movie really makes no sense. There are numerous continuity errors (and I'm not one of those knit picky people) that make the narrative hard to follow. There's a few ridiculously long pan shots that have absolutely no function and yet are inserted at pivotal moments in the. And then there's the comical adventure in fonts that dot the movie from act to act. Clearly way more time was spent on stylistic considerations rather than just telling the damn story.Clearly Lowery is half as smart as he thinks he is.Not a fan.,The Green Knight
106,isaacsundaralingam,Incomplete... feels very incomplete,6,23 October 2021,"Now, I get it... the ambiguity is what drives this story forward... and that's the whole point. But I feel like it's ambiguity poorly done. The journey is disjointed and the stakes feel unimportant. Honour and valour are talked about quite often, but never materialized in any meaningful way to make us care. And that's my issue with The Green Knight in a single paragraph.I love Dev Patel as an actor, and he does nothing short of a stellar job portraying Sir Gawain. And being an (almost) one man show, he delivers and delivers so with unrivaled passion. And the second strongest aspect of this movie is its visuals. Because man, were they gorgeous from start to finish. While I might have my complaints with The Green Knight as a movie from a storytelling perspective, I cannot fault its astounding visual language. The set pieces were stunning, the landscapes were mesmerizing and the colors were extremely complementary to the progressing storyline. The movie wins big on its presentation.I didn't expect too much going into this, and while I wasn't really disappointed, I did feel like a little more every step of the way would have made me like the overall experience better.",The Green Knight

109,hughnwilliams,Interesting but slow/unnecessarily confusing,6,4 September 2021,"If you were looking for a sword and sorcery action film, this isn't it. It still held my interest with an intriguing premise, interesting vignettes within the larger story, and beautiful cinematography that was really artistic at times.Ultimately the story was a bit too confusing and the ending too ambiguous for my taste. I was familiar with the Arthurian tale of the Green Knight going into the movie, but writer/director David Lowery modified it considerably. That was to be expected to some degree since the original tale is from the 13th century and a bit too straightforward for a modern movie plot. Unfortunately, Lowery may have gone a step too far and generated confusion where none really needed to be.I like movies that make me think, but some of the confusion could have so clearly been mitigated just through better dialogue. In reading some of the interviews with Lowery, it sounds like even he wasn't always sure what his decisions meant, using words like ""messy"" and ""just went with it"" to describe some of the choices. Who is the antagonist in this movie? In the Arthurian tale it's Morgan Le Fay, but she doesn't show up until near the end. In the movie Lowery makes a smart choice to introduce her sooner as Gawain's mother, but she seems to be earnestly trying to help his cause and it's never certain that she's even an antagonist.The ambiguous ending was Sopranos-sequel and Lowery even referenced it as being similar to this one, which is annoying to me. The Sopranos earned that ending with seven seasons of the best show on TV. This movie needed both a better and more definitive ending after a two hour slog of symbolism.I don't mind symbolism, or having to think or even read a bit afterwards to figure out a movie. I liked some of that here but some just seemed unnecessary and a missed opportunity. Some just seemed random with no real explanation available, even from the writer himself. Due to all that I can only give this movie a 6.",The Green Knight
110,jindann,It's just dumb to think it's meaningful,3,21 August 2021,"This is unlike other movies, but more like a bizarre fairy tale. Perhaps the movie wants us to learn to honor the promises and do good even enduring hardships, while murdering someone in cold blood or having immoral sex is totally fine that you can get away with it and be rewarded. Also the movie suffers from boring long drags and lack of intensity, which can be largely improved if a large portion of the script is rewritten by increasing the depth, character developments and connection of events. Though the setup and acting was decent, they are kind of wasted as a lot of stuffs were actually quite meaningless with a rather empty plot that makes the movie dull, well as the dumb decisions made by the protagonist that makes it more underwhelming.",The Green Knight

112,BijeshNagesh,Standard-Setting Excellence,10,20 August 2021,"A24 and Leyline Entertainment better take a bow for bringing together the perfect cast and crew. The chemistry on screen - I saw ""Green Knight"" on Amazon Prime Video - was simply sublime.Production design by Jade Healy, Set decoration by Jenny Oman, and Costume design by Malgosia Turzanska all made this movie a winner purely by making it stand out. And my god, the locations!Daniel Hart's musical scoring was just magic. The soundtrack suite was spot-on Medieval, and perfect because of its attention to the period's signature notes and choruses.Andrew Droz Palermo's cinematography - those extended shots! That natural lighting! - was downright teleportive. The movie often felt like I was there, in person, watching it from an actual human being's point of view, like I was someone in the room, perhaps even a ghost in the mist or smoke, watching.All the crew teams did great work, including and especially VFX, sound effects, special effects, and stunts.The sheer attention to detail and respect for the original lore while still deviating dramatically into a parallel 'what if' plotline all speaks to the patience, dedication, and genius of ""Green Knight"" director David Lowery, who also wrote the screenplay and fulfilled the editing role - whew!Curious casting choices indeed, especially with Dev Patel given the ubiquitously 'white' role of Sir Gawain the 'Green Knight' - only in this film, Gawain and the Green Knight are two entirely different characters. Dev was masterful in the skin of his given character, and truly made the script feel credible.Ralph Ineson playing the Green Knight gave me chills and thrills to no end - and some legit 'Headless Horseman' vibes. His costume and makeup alone were outstanding, to say nothing of his screen presence - an ode to his acting skills, truly, for the man nary uttered more than a few words in each sentence.Alicia Vikander played dual roles, one being Gawain's love interest Essel and the other being The Lady (not of the Lake). She brought wonderful balance to the story with both roles.Sarita Choudhury as Gawain's mother was amazing. Joel Edgerton as The Lord was superb. Kate Dickie as Queen Guinevere was captivating, and Sean Harris as King Arthur was inspiring. Barry Keoghan as Scavenger was dastardly and diabolical.Erin Kellyman as (Saint) Winifred - some dark 'Lady of the Lake' vibes! - was noteworthy, especially the part where the Green Knight's axe was returned - he was robbed on his way to meet said Knight as per their agreement - to Gawain in lieu of the classical sword. The story-portions involving her character were deep (pun unintended) and well-crafted.Hats off to Louise Kiely, who did the casting for this film. The movie could have gone wrong in so many ways, most especially around the employment of a diverse cast in lieu of the oft-seen all-white versions for a story and play that harkens back to the heart of Ancient Britain. But it worked, and worked might fine indeed.Speaking of, ""The Green Knight"" is a classic 'Arthurian Chivalric Romance' that was adapted from the 14th century poem titled 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'.In the 2021 movie, however, Gawain is King Arthur's nephew, and his mother is the sorceress Morgan Le Fay whose subtle and silent politicking was a treat to watch. It is Christmas in Camelot, characters are diligently introduced in sequence, and the core storyline integrated sundry classic-Arthurian elements like the Round Table and more. The film was far from grand and heroic, but was gritty, macabre, and realistic. It was hauntingly beautifully because of that.They even remained true to the yester-era writing (calligraphy), painting (illustration), fabric and clothing designs (weave, stitch, embroidery, cut), speech styles (thee, thy, thou), and name pronunciations (medieval phonetics). Not to sound like Hermione Granger (whom I actually adore) but, it's 'Gah-win' not 'Guh-wayn'.They balanced each of these factors so artfully that they didn't distract or detract from the main storyline and its core characters. The twists and plot variations were more than welcome - they just made it work. And don't get me started on the fox that Gawain befriended in the forest - all those scenes were splendid too.There was a wealth of symbolism in this movie that was entirely worth appreciating. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the two hours that comprised this brilliant movie - I'd have sat through a five-hour version, if they made one. This film lives up to the literary dictum 'read between the lines'. In this case, 'watch between the scenes'. There were plenty of moments and encounters that felt deeply meaningful than literal or coincidental.""The Green Knight"" 2021 movie is, in my opinion, a potent cinematic chapter that has added, nay enhanced, the collective Arthurian lore and literature. It was at once enchanting, relatable, and detailed. It was filmmaking artistry worthy of celebration. It should definitely be one of your must-watch movies of 2021, be it in theatres or via streaming.",The Green Knight

It sounds like a great movie however the story is really boring, everything that happened feels really pointless and it wasn't a great experience honestly.

If there was supposed to be a message the director did a poor job of conveying it.So Gawain's mother is a witch and conjured the green knight just so it could kill Gawain in the end? I'm so confused. The movie never discussed why the green knight was summoned. Was Gawain's head really lopped off but kept in tact by the green sash? Why summon the green knight then try to protect Gawain from it?I'm as lost as a kangaroo at the north pole! Who was the fox? Gawain's mother?,The Green Knight

The pacing is on the slow side but I never thought it dragged, there was always something happening. If you go into this thinking it's a Lord of the Rings type action fantasy adventure then you'll be disappointed and maybe that's why the poor reviews.I vaguely remember the story from a TV version many years ago but this movie seems to have all the basic elements in place while adding a few encounters from other tales to pad out the runtime.",The Green Knight
118,mgumsley,Why does this remind me of 'The King's new clothes'?,4,26 September 2021,"A lot of reviewers have used the word pretentious in describing this movie. I would hate to do that, and I like Dev Patel too much to assume such a thing. However, I must admit I didn't follow the plot well, and I was extremely bored at times. The cinematography, acting, and production values were all first class, but as for me, I think I must be like the little boy in the Hans Andersen story who couldn't rave about the King's new clothes because he could not see anything. And that just about sums it up, and I have loved other Arthurian tales such as 'Excalibur' .",The Green Knight
119,thefendiprint,"Pretty to look at, but that's about it",4,3 August 2021,"Went into this film expecting to enjoy more than most, considering I am a fan of most A24 films. But boy is this a disappointing film. Sure, the cinematography and acting are both top notch, but this is yet another example of style over substance, which happens more often than not with a lot of A24 films unfortunately. The story itself is very straightforward and honestly not as complex as many reviewers here may suggest. It's based on an Arthurian poem, but the issue lies in the fact that the story itself is not all that intriguing to begin with, coupled with the fact that the director changed the ending and added unnecessary additions that have NO mythical relation to the poem, that ultimately makes this film so underwhelming. The ending is completely different and purposely left ambiguous, which I already have an issue with because I am so beyond tired of directors leaving endings open-ended. Simply because they themselves are so far up their own pretentious a***** that they cannot even explain their reasonings, and instead leave it ""up to the audience"" to interpret it how they want. So it almost always feels like a cop-out. On top of the ambiguous ending, so many other plot points are absolutely looked over and not explained whatsoever. Why are there giants? Why does everyone want to kiss Gaiwan? Why does his mother want to torment him with the Green Knight? Is she the Green Knight? No one knows. And by the end of the film, I also don't care.Ultimately, while this is beautiful to look at, everything else is mediocre. Give it a shot if you wish, but do not expect some sort of cinematic masterpiece. This is not that.",The Green Knight
120,MovieWarfare,A unique tale about bravery and honour,8,21 August 2021,"I love the Arthurian legend but most stories concerning it in TV and film is mostly about the titular King Arthur. However, The Green Knight is focused on one of the knights instead, Sir Gawain. The premise is ""King Arthur's headstrong nephew embarks on a daring quest to confront the Green Knight, a mysterious giant who appears at Camelot. Risking his head, he sets off on an epic adventure to prove himself before his family and court"". So is Sir Gawain's story worth telling or should we just go back to King Arthur?Firstly, this movie is visually stunning. The cinematography by Andrew Droz Palermo is gorgeous and very magical. Almost every single shot in this film is like a painting and that alone makes it feel very fantastical. The lighting is also something to admire. At the beginning of the journey is a dreary, gloomy colour of the towns but it then goes to the green and grey forest that feels haunting yet beautiful. As the movie progress, it starts to become more colourful to signify the journey's end but also the more fantasy elements. The world itself is so interesting to watch as well. Many weird magical elements occur in this (that I won't spoil) that is just so oddly fascinating to watch. The music score by Daniel Hart is also phenomenal. It always complements the scene, the story and the world of The Green Knight. It is occasionally eerie but also sometimes has a fantastical flair to it that is just a blessing to listen to.Dev Patel is the main lead and plays Sir Gawain. He does an amazing job as he perfectly conveys the struggle and the toll this journey takes on Gawain. Ralph Ineson is also remarkable as the Green Knight as Ralph gives a powerful voice that feels creepy but not downright villainous that exactly fits the character. The rest of the supporting cast all do a good job as well. Special mention goes to Sean Harris as the King who gives a convincing wise old man performance and Barry Keoghan who is just very ominous in his performance. Another thing I love about this film is the real mystery throughout the story. There are a fair amount of obstacles and weird scenarios that occur in Gawain's journey that are just intriguing to dissect. You end up questioning a lot about what is real or not. The film never outright explains everything, so it is up to us to try and solve or interpret the trials which are enjoyable to do. There is also the constant theme about honour and bravery that sounds simple on paper but is handle here in a more provocative manner that just works.However, the film not explaining everything results in way too many questions. The movie doesn't even explain why the Green Knight exist or why it is even there? The film does imply that it was the result of witches but if this is the case then what was the motive of the witches in doing that? Not explaining the titular character's is very problematic as now we have to go through assumptions of their motive instead of a proper confirmation. There is also a lot of just weird stuff that happens with no proper explanation and you're just going to have to accept it when watching this. Due to this, I can understand The Green Knight turning people off because it is intentionally vague on nearly everything. Additionally, this is an incredibly slow-burning movie. It goes at a very slow snail pace with a lot of scenes of Gawain walking or riding or even just genuinely nothing. The Green Knight is at 130 minutes long and honestly, it didn't need to be that long considering the number of shots of literally nothing.Overall, The Green Knight is not a movie for everyone. It is an artistic and slow movie but it is a very unique movie that tells a profound story about honour. Well, that is how I interpret it and if you watch this then you may interpret it differently. Sir Gawain's story was an interesting one and I hope for tales like this from the Arthurian legend.",The Green Knight

124,Mike_O_Dwyer,This Crazy Thing Happened So I Went Away & Came Back,7,28 August 2021,"Gawain - Dev Patel, before he's a knight - goes on a road trip quest after taking part in a challenge with The Green Knight which seems to have been incepted by his mother's witchcraft in order that Gawain find favour with a dying King so that her son might one day become king. So, if you're looking for something that's a little bit Excalibur, a little bit Monty Python (must be the king, he hasn't got shit all over him), a little bit Company of Wolves, a little bit Inception...you get the idea.I love a road movie, being taken to places I haven't been before, or better still, being taken to places I have been before and seeing them through someone else's eyes if such a treat. It's a great way to have smaller roles play a significant part without having to sideline them into the background after they've had their moment. Patel's Gawain is the journey we go on, from spoilt whoring brat to, possibly, spoilt whoring brat who finds a way towards having a somewhat meaningful existence. All the strangers he meets are there to teach him something about himself that he's blind to, as are all strangers on these kinds of road trips: Sean Harris & Kate Dickie's sickly translucent Arthur & Guinevere, half remembered legends barely made flesh in whose name the world holds itself together; Sarita Choudhury's Morgana, fabulous as Gawain's Ma, who pulls the strings and plots for power with witchery and inception; Alicia Vikander's tomboy whore who is more in love with Gawain than perhaps he with her, but her bubbly optimism is what keeps her going; Barry Keoghan's cute hoor scavenger, all the yak and disingenuous natter necessary for one gifted with the gab; a saint who's lost her head; a red coated companion along for the ride; keening giants; Joel Edgerton Anthony Hopkining his way through period pieces is as delightful as always, here as a landy Lord wedded to a mischievously handy Lady; and, of course, The Green knight himself.Everyone is game, and Patel carries of the role of callow youth being coerced towards taking on the responsibilities of being a knight with an easy charm. I would easily have spend more time in that court with Harris, Dickie, Choudhury and Vikander, who are all eminently much more fun than anything else in the film. They are such strongly written characters, with such strong and interesting features you yearn to hear the stories they have to tell and how they might tell them. Unfortunately we have to follow a boy on his way to becoming a man, and as such Gawain is merely a device upon which to hang a series of character sketches. The trouble is that none of them are particularly brilliant or quirked enough to be hugely memorable, serviceable might be a bit unfair but not wholly inaccurate.There are some very tasty visuals, especially in the opening scenes, and the use of colour and light throughout is pretty much nailed on.It does lag, here and there, but not much, and not for long. It definitely needs something far more punchy in the middle section to give it some kick, and I get the feeling they knew this when writing it. Gawain is given a companion for part of his journey, which is something all the best road movies have for obvious reasons, but Gawain's companion falls into the gap that exists between curiosity and non-entity. Some of the sparkling wit of Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead would have been welcome, or some of the easy charm of The Old Man and The Gun, or even some deranged shroom visions, or Tim Curry's OTT Lord of Darkness. The rather and unimaginative CGI giants we got instead feel like a tacked on quick fix, neither special or effective.There is a sense that the writing, which starts out vividly with great bold strokes to set up the world and finishes strongly with an insightful follow-through, gets lost in the middle in terms of imagination. From the get-go we're presented with a world of magic and realism, the grit and grime of medieval living and the gamesmanship of seeking power, all of which fritters away once the road trip begins before coming back towards the final act. There's a lot of scenery on a road trip, but the best part of the journey should be the people and situations that make the telling of the tale worth the effort, not what happened before you left and after you arrived.",The Green Knight
125,MK_Ultra_,Neo-classic blend of Paganism and Arthurian themed masterstroke.,10,19 August 2021,"This is a film to get lost in. With its beautiful mystery and lush landscapes, it is truly one to absorb. Loosely based on the poem, Lowery auteurs himself into his own classic tale, much like John Boorman did before him. Mysticism and supernatural follow much like Excalibur, but even more beautifully shot.This is a unique and some may find a challenging view, coupled with terrific story arcs, mystical lands and creatures while taking the ""anti-hero"" stance with Gawain, one who still hasn't found his way with confidence, bravery, and honesty. A bit of the antithesis of the brave knight stories we've come to know, but an unsure, almost cowardly lead role that Patel shines in here, who would rather hang out in the brothel and drink than take the step that he pushes himself into. His ""story"" that he lacks---is thrown at him within the first act, when he nearly blindly accepts the challenge that could be his true story that could be a step towards manhood...or one that makes him just the opposite. You will see the paths as both are put before you.A slow-burn type of meandering film that invites you in with imagery and rich colors...and leaves you with an impression when the credits roll.Watch without distraction...it pays off. To me, this is A24s finest moment.",The Green Knight
126,PerryAtTheMovies,A non-memorable movie....,5,11 August 2021,"My Ratings:
Overall: 49/100
IMDb: 5/10
Letterboxd: 2.5/5While the concept of the story seemed interesting and engaging. The execution was far from, in my opinion. The length of the film was too long. Everything dragged on as if to fill white space for the sake of filling white space. I also found the soundtrack of the film to be great, and it worked for the scenes they were made for, however, I did find that it overpowered the spoken word at times and it made it hard to understand what was being said.After having seen the movie I went and watched the trailer and I found that they overhyped the film. I expected there to be a decent amount of action as Sir Gawain makes his trek to face the Green Knight. Yet there was virtually none. The story is more of a long, drawn out fairytale.Honestly, nothing in this film was truly memorable to me, and if I had waited any longer to write this review, I may not have had anything to say.Overall, perhaps it was the wrong movie for me to see as the only thing I can come up with was that the film was long and boring. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially, if you're expecting an action/adventure style movie.Enjoy the show....",The Green Knight
127,knedb,It's mediocre...,5,23 August 2021,"Just one question... Why is Gawain played by Dev Patel? An Indian guy in Camelot??? Even medieval movies gotta be politically correct. God forbid that everyone in Camelot is white lol. Anyways, the acting is pretty good, but the movie moves at a tortoise pace. If you're patient, then you might like it.",The Green Knight
128,jcooloti,Not made for the uneducated... Great movie.,9,29 September 2021,"I really wanted to give this film a 10, but choices made by David Lowery made this film somewhat difficult to follow, even to someone somewhat familiar with the poem it's based on and the legend of King Arthur's court.We all could have used a recap. Especially when it comes to the five chivalric virtues of knighthood. That's right... there's a reason why all of the Knights of the Round Table and King Arthur himself are wearing those five pointed stars. These are the five points.1. Piety - Your relationship with God.-Gowain fails this test by lying to his mother about attending mass on Christmas morning. He rather party at the brothel... this is why his mom cast some old school pre-Christian spell with her coven to summon the Green Knight, who represents nature, AKA God to literally make a noble man out of him by challenging him. It's Gowain's mom, Arthur's sister who is pulling the strings behind this whole deal. She also enchants a sash to protect him from physical harm that she gives to him before he sets out.2. Generosity - Kindness towards others.Giwain fails this test when he reluctantly gives a boy a single coin after he gives him directions... even after the kid explains that his brothers have died fighting for the Arthur's kingdom. Pretty cold. So he gets bushwhacked but this kid's crew and they steal the Green Knights axe... and the sash. Big fail.3. Courtesy - Willingness to help others and keep his word.-Gawain almost blows this one by asking the ghost of the girl looking for her head in the river what he will get in return if he retrieves her head. After being scolded by her for asking, he decides to go down there and grab it, therefore passing the trial. His reward is the reward of being returned the Green Knight's axe.4. Chastity - Ability to resist temptation.This one gets a little complicated. He is seduced by the man's wife in the house... and in the process, literally ""soils"" the sash (his mom's sash) she ask him to take. After ""soiling"" it, he literally takes off with it and dishonors his host by not ""trading all things given"" in the house. This one is kind of weird.. it's sort of a half fail... he gets the sash back, but prematurely climaxes in the process and very shamefully.. it's literally covered in his... well, you know. This is the most complicated trial in my opinion and is open to a lot of interpretation.5. Friendship- Companionship (with the Fox)-He lashes out against his companion, the little Fox who is trying to warn him about the certain death he is about to face by meeting the Green Knight. Some would say this is a fail, but we all know what he has to do. He can't just quit. This is another grey area when it comes to the pass or fail. I think it's important to think of these as trials. It's not so much important what if you pass or fail, but rather if you learn anything from it in the end.That brings him to the beheading at the Green Chapel. He begins this whole ordeal with basically weaseling out of it all... flinching and such, while also not removing the sash that will protect him from the death blow. It's in this process he sees what would happen if he just bailed on the whole thing and went home and how dishonorable his life would be. One can't help but to compare this to stories such as the Last Temptation of Christ. He learns a lesson having this revelation and comprehends what it means to be a true knight and why the five points (chivalric virtues) are so important. He removes the (soiled) sash and accepts his fate: Execution at the hands of the Green Knight (Nature... God... The Green Man...Karma... whatever you want to label it). We are left with a great ambiguous ending when the Green Knight almost jokingly says, ""Okay, off with your head"" and we don't actually see him killed. It makes one wonder if the Green Knight actually killed him. I like to think that Gawain is ""born again"" in that moment. In a sense, having learned from everything leading up to that point... he kind of has died in a sense. It's in that moment he realizes everything and accepts his everything that he truly becomes a knight (or possibly, a worthy King). In the end, it doesn't really even matter. The only thing that matters is that he trancends.So yeah, thanks for sticking with me this far if you're still reading! If you see the movie with all this in mind, it's actually quite stunning. It has amazing acting and cinematography. The only flaw in my personal opinion is by not making this clear to the layman. I mean, most people don't know what the five points stand for, that they even exist and also that is what all those stars they're wearing represent! I had to look it back up to fully be able to grasp the plot of this film after having seen it.... And I'm a weirdo that likes doing stuff like that but a lot of people don't want to do that or wouldn't even bother. This all could have been avoided by providing the audience with some much needed exposition in the beginning of the movie. Why wouldn't you do that?!? Don't you want EVERYONE to GET your movie? Is this movie only for well read scholars? It seems so silly to me that they wouldn't provide that exposition in the beginning. Were they afraid it would be to on the nose? It wouldn't... it's a friggin Arthurian legend and this is 2021. Not all of us are familiar with that stuff! It's the films only flaw in my opinion. You can't neglect your audience like that. Not with a film like this that has roots in some very, very old ideas that not everyone is familiar with. Other than that, it's amazing! Imagine seeing this movie for the first time having had someone explain the five points to you?!? It's an entirely different experience!I just want to reiterate how incredibly good looking this film is. The cinematography is breathtaking.One last thing. There's a lot of racist fools that are trashing this movie because the leading man is of Indian descent. This is outrageous and really shows how horrible these people are that are trashing the film for this reason. This movie is a morality tale set in a fictional time and place... all that stuff is completely OBSOLETE. And the lead actor is incredibly good in it. I mean... REALLY GOOD. Anyone that is confusing an Arthurian Legend loosely based on a Poem written by an anonymous author and taking it as a representation of how things were in the sixth century is pretty uneducated. There's literally talking foxes, giants and wizards in this story... This film is certainly not made for the uneducated.",The Green Knight

Alicia's two characters as both Esel the prostitute and the Lady, made the movie look surreal which in a way it was and she played them to perfection.The story based of old English/Welsh poem literature can be hard to interpret into film but it was done well.Note the Saint Winifred scene.. that part was suppose to be Welsh poem also appears in movie this again is based on the old texts. Great attention to detail in story telling mixed with events that never occurred to keep the story going.But still a great movie!",The Green Knight
131,maakus,Snooze fest galore.,3,20 August 2021,"I give ""The Green Knight"" three stars, purely because of it's somewhat stylish cinematography. The story and the pacing is the definition of a snoozer tho, because literally nothing interesting or intriguing happens during the entire movie. It's a person travelling from point A to B and nothing happens in between. No interesting characters and no interesting happenings.The story of ""Sir Gawain and the green knight"" isn't that interesting and detailed to begin with, so god knows why they thought it would be suitable for a movie? Especially when they didn't bother to elaborate and add to the story.",The Green Knight
132,blackoutH,Medieval times + hallucinogenic trip,4,20 September 2021,"I have to say that my knowledge of the Arthurian legends is very basic, so I didn't had much expectations to the movie, I only went knowing that it involved a bit of fantasy and a challenge.What draw me into the movie itself was actually the cast, I haven't seen Dev Patel in a while and the whole theatrical trailer and the fantasy mixed in seemed quite interesting.This tells the story of one of Arthur's knights and a challenge that he courageously (?) accepts to embark in. I do like the idea of making legends coming to live and adding the mystery and fantasy and originality since most of them are quite hard to figure what where reality ends and the fiction starts.The actors did a good job, and the cinematography is amazing, stunning landscapes are presented throughout the movie and it starts off good, with the mysticism (helped by the odd soundtrack) does work.However things start to quickly turn, first the pace - yes this is an easy complaint to make and probably one of the most cliché criticism but its true, the pace is annoyingly slow, we have tons of unnecessary scenes where the camera is filming the Knight's journey, slow rotations of the landscapes, some more images of the Knight on the horse - and those don't seem to have any cinematic purpose, they actually cut a lot of the build up tension.Also, the story as a whole seems a bit anecdotic, sure it's about courage, accepting death, being honorable, respect nature and all the themes you might see in other critics for the movies, but the challenge itself, I mean it doesn't make sense it doesn't feel necessary for the knight to go on this journey - I didn't read the original material, but maybe the movie doesn't convey the knight's feelings as it should, specially why we he accept such an odd challenge and why does he complete the way he does knowing perfectly well how it would end up?For me the lessons didn't stick in, it's a slow story and the obstacles present throughout the knight's journey are strange and they seem to struggle conveying their true meaning.Still amazing natural landscapes hence I can't rate it lower.",The Green Knight

145,marcgreenman,"visually beautiful, appealing, lovely sound design and music, lots to think about",9,24 September 2021,"I was really struck when this film was withdrawn from uk cinemas and am still looking for a place where i can see it on a large screen, hopefully we will all be able to at some point. I am not sure whether this film will be for everyone as it leans very much on artistry and drama and character and has limited action which is what many people look for in their entertainment; the green knight is looking for something much deeper and longer lasting, and i think that it is a film which will endure. It feels distinctly different from excalibur, perhaps the most obvious point of comparison. Although there are some signs of combat, unlike excalibur the combat is very much in the background. Dev patel does a great job providing sir gawain with layers of development, making him believable and watchable even though he is not obviously likeable; gawain is highly flawed in many ways and there is every suggestion that his mission is misguided or even a failure. This film is very much about an individual's personal quest to find themselves. Gawain is not a knight at the beginning and there are frequent questions over whether he is ever really a knight in the true sense. There is also the question of whether the quest is more important than the destination. I must say that this film looks absolutely beautiful and is well worth seeing on that basis, it is not likely that you will soon see a film which appears more stunning. The film can be very dark in places, which sometimes made it hard to work out what was actually happening. Darkness and shadow are used quite heavily here at many points. The sound design and music are equally wonderful, as is the choir which sometimes appears in the background. Some of the music is medieval, some is very strange indeed; i was absorbed by the very weirdness of certain pieces such as the green knight theme. The green knight is an excellent design clearly designed to represent the green man legend. Nature is seen as a palpable force in its own right, and magic as being real; the green knight's appearances often bring supernatural phenomena of some form with them. The talking fox was a nice idea but i didn't get it, i didn't understand quite what it was supposed to be and the cgi was not completely convincing. Aside from the knight himself we also have the mysterious giants, an overtly fantastical element; much of the rest of the film feels fairly realistic and convincing. Arthur is portrayed in a rather interesting way as a very elderly king who is looking increasingly fragile and helpless. Morgana is depicted in a somewhat understated manner. There are a few unexpected and almost random incidents which do change the course of events, some were straightforward some i did not quite understand. Joel edgerton's lord is quite important, by his words he implies that he actually knows gawain quite well; raising questions as to how this is so, possibly edgerton is another manifestation of the green knight himself. Gawain takes the axe at an early stage and keeps it with him for some time; clearly this is symbolic in itself in some way as the camera often lingers on it and it becomes part of the plot, although exactly what it means i couldn't quite work out. There is a magical scarf which gawain wears around his waist which supposedly grants him invulnerability, this gift is significant as well and turns up at a number of points. Gawain is passed arthur's sword at one point but has to give it up for the green knight's axe instead, perhaps this means that nature is more important than the human kingdom. Another important point is that sometimes women turn up wearing blindfolds, there are at least two women who do this although why they do so is again not completely clear.",The Green Knight

It feels like the final dialogue is just missing. Watch it you will see. I cannot go into more without spoilers.The question they tried to spin the movie around is Is it better to live a lie that presents itself as what you wanted, or to face the alternative but remain true to yourself. Problem with that is how we reach that point, and how that entire premise is established. Here lies the failure; it really is not set right not led in right.Outside of the philosophical metaphors, this movie is bad. Boring. Failed to capture the use of magic and mythology and the movie stumbles through just like the character does over rocks and ravines.What happened to just being able to tell a story in script? What happened to having things happen for a reason, what happened to movies being pleasant to watch, what happened to establishing empathy with the cast? Movie makers, you have lost your way.

There's just not a lot of dialogue in its 130 minutes.Some watchers hate that, and some love it. Either way, one shouldn't deny Dev Patel the credit he deserves for communicating to the audience via expression and body language alone. His effort is truly gallant.If you are merely looking for entertainment, this may not be for you. It has a dark feel; its weight presses down on the viewer. Just the same, if you are a student of film, and geek out on creative or unusual elements, GK is a MUST.The opening narrative is about the the rare work the film is based on. Constance Grady wrote an interesting article and addresses that topic.""Composed by an anonymous poet in the late 14th century, Sir Gawain features none of the most well-known aspects of the Arthurian legends."" She also describes Gawain's story as ""one of the weirdest"" offerings from the tales of Camelot.Director Lowery portrays the film as ""being about the importance of comporting one's self with integrity and goodness over being concerned with one's legacy.""Honor is the major theme of the movie. No one should disparage that ideal, though the concept has been largely overlooked by our over-entitled individualistic society. Honor is about the way we treat others, not about making ourselves look good.Gawain is alone for a large portion of the movie, displaying that honor is the narrow path. GK ahould provoke meaningful discussions with teenagers.If the script were not based on a work that is coasting its way to a millennial anniversary, I'd have disparaged Gawain's initial interaction with the the Green Knight as very foolhardy. As is, we should just accept it.The ending is left open for some interpretation.

164,mistabobdobolina,"Weird, surreal and enjoyable",8,24 August 2021,"The Green Knight is extremely weird and really cool. Best enjoyed if you like films that are long on atmosphere, striking visuals, and the surreal. It's actually pretty true to the (rather inscrutable) original material, but changes it in interesting ways.It offers memorable performances from Dev Patel and Alicia Vikander and some cool walk-on roles, in particular for Erin Kellyman. There's a lot of mind-bending fantasy content that feels genuinely... eldritch, for lack of a better word. This is not a story about a world that has a ""magic system."" Magic is poetic and unsettling and frightening and genuinely, at some level, inexplicable. The excellent sound design and soundtrack contribute heavily to this otherworldly air.Fair warning, however: it's also quite slow-paced, dense, and demanding. It's definitely not an actioner or *Game of Thrones,* and the sort of person who just bounces off of arthouse films (or calls them ""pretentious"" as a kneejerk reaction) will hate it. If that isn't you, however, it's worth your time.",The Green Knight

The ""king"" comes across like a bored actor in a silly costume. Dialog like stuff you'd read on a cereal box. It's truly an ""I want my money back"" experience!This may be a modern ""legend,"" but it is said that back in the 1960s some stoners could indulge in a ""pill salad"" and then sit and watch through the oven door as a turkey roasted all the way through.

Afterwards it descends into not much more than disjointed parables and drawn out scenery. Was it all a fevered dream? Was each story secretly an individual test for Garwain to overcome and mature from? Damned if I know, though having some familiarity with the original story would probably help.The movie is beautifully shot and I really digged the soundtrack.

175,LadyJackal,I think I'm being generous by giving it 5 stars...,5,6 August 2021,"You have Dev Patel (one star). You have great music (another star). But it is more like a thriller or a mystery movie than a movie about the good, old legend of the Knights of the Round Table . I was so frustrated and disappointed actually . Because I read the original work, when I was a freshman at University. The ending was completely altered here (the green knight is supposed to spare sir gwain, it should not be an open-ending).The first greatest sin actually would be the lack of the original plot twist. It's like The usual Suspects without Kayzer söze, revealed to be the villain. How can you remove the fact that lord bertilak and the green knight are the same person ??? You could have an ordinary movie with some mysterious elements , instead of this. A movie with elves and fairies and Supernatural Things.....just create a knightly hero minus the name sir gwain! Just don't do that to an Arthurian story! Don't completely ruin the original story! We're offended as the arthur lovers.Another crime should be mentioned here; because sir gwain was made a coward forcefully, by the movie producers. I know you're trying to give a message but it's what destroys a character; Because bravery is a an important human character trait ... No female or male character don't deserve to lose her/his bravery because of an adaptation. It doesn't equal it when an imaginary character is given some bravery by adaptation.The third sin would be having an actress, playing 2 roles. The first girl was non-existent in the original material . And she's completely out of the blue here. Okay, i get that your point is, ""sir gwain couldn't reject lady bertilak easily; because she resembled his first girlfriend"". But that's exactly the problem! The original lady actually functioned like a bridge between sir gwain & the green knight. Not a bridge between sir gwain & his mischievous girlfriend back in his hometown.This movie fails for a fourth time because sir gwain does lose his virtue due to Lady b. I know I'm repeating myself , but I'll keep on saying that it betrays the original material. Okay , it might be the production of an Anonymous person; but we are still reading and enjoying these magical adventures of Merlin & Co ... The commitment between Sir Gawain and the Green Knight should've been made in the exact moment when sir gwain eventually took the first step into the chapel - oh, how we waited for him to get rid of those stupid road obstacles !!! It's not a movie about road trip, it's a freaking quest, i think the scenario writer didn't actually read the original material.sir gwain is supposed to spend 3 days with Lord b. & his family; on the first day, he is supposed to be kissed by the lady. On the second day , he should be kissed by her TWICE. On the third day , he should be kissed thrice. He should give the Lord 6 kisses at total. This was such a beautiful homo erotical subtext back in the original story.Let's continue with the fifth sin..... ""sir gwain and the green knight"" was written in the beginning of Christianity , more or less. I exactly remember the important details from the original material; because that was one of my favorite stories from my freshman year; and I exactly remember that there were some Pagan details still. For example, number 5 was so important . Why do you remove such details? The original green knight didn't deserve that. Sir gwain didn't deserve that treatment as a character. Someone should make another movie with Patel again. But this time, they should be loyal to the original material . And I think , the producers of ""king Arthur: the legend of the sword"" are the most suitable crew for this idea.because that was an excellent adaptation of the good, old myths. It's also another shame that it wasn't continued with a sequel. Just imagine the blond actor,playing King Arthur with dev Patel - i could not remember his name, sorry. I want to see the figure that represented Morgan Le Fay in that movie. She was simply called ""the mage"" and she's better than the female characters of this movie. The mage would be a nice heroine , wouldn't she? I just want justice for guinevere, lancelot, merlin, morgan and all..",The Green Knight
176,guskeller,Poetry in Motion,10,18 August 2021,"Poetry in motion, The Green Knight is true artistry on all levels. Though very dense and sometimes too cryptic for the general viewer, it cannot be denied that this film has a definitive voice. With style that is wholly immersive and unwavering messages, The Green Knight reaches into the depths of the human experience that are both frightening and oddly serene. Ideas of mortality, purpose, and nature are just a few themes woven into the fabric of this seamless tapestry. Meanwhile, every frame is a painting, making The Green Knight a visual pleasure.David Lowery's carefully crafted, surreal masterpiece is driven by its striking imagery, ominous score, and mesmerizing production design. Yet, it is Dev Patel's performance which brings the subtleties of our protagonist, Gawain, to agonizing life and elevates this film to a level of lasting familiarity. In the end, The Green Knight is a rich experience that will challenge our existential views and leave a haunting impression.Writing: 9/10

178,TigerHeron,Complete Destruction of a Medieval Poem,4,9 August 2021,"One of the worst movies I've seen in awhile. It's slow moving and pretentious. But the biggest problem with it is that it totally destroys what the original piece of literature was about. I admit I have only read parts of ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" plus an introductory essay about it, but actually, you do not need to know much to know this cannot possibly be a beloved medieval story. The original story is about knighthood and honor, and although this version pretends to be about knighthood and honor, it is cynical and gross and does not follow the plot of the original story at all. In fact it turns it upside down. The filmmakers have the temerity to claim it is a cinematic adaptation of the poem, but other than the fact both have green knights, a character named Gawain, a green sash and a couple of other characters who vaguely resemble the original characters, this film has nothing in common with the poem. Sadly the original author has been dead for 700 years and cannot sue.",The Green Knight
179,deothor,"This ""THEME movie"" is extremaly frustrating",2,10 August 2021,"This is not your ""normal"" movie. This is a ""THEME"" movie. Plot is secondary, so are characters, and scenes, or ""action"". All of that is brushed aside for a very badly injected theme, that only makes a lick of sense in last few minutes of the movie. Untill that happens, this ""movie"" is a collection of random'ish scenes, random'ish (AND WHOLLY POINTLESS) plot points and oh-my-lord incredibly long takes at nothing. Main character stares into grass = 1 minute, main character walks, 2 minutes, is in the forest, another 2 minutes. STARES AT SOMEONES FACE 2 minutes.. or more... Seriously, if you were to remove all the uneccessary and obviously too long scenes, this movie wouldn't even last half of its runtime. It is BLOATED. Another thing is: beyond just few scenes, this movie feels incredibly cheap. Not just cheap, but almost as if ""a student with camera decided to film a movie in woods"" kind of cheap. There are moment where simple coloured flashlight shone on knights face is supposedly all that director decided for... tension. There are few CGI scenes and they are fine.I was about to make a summary of the plot.. but it's pointless. If I were to condense it into... like few sentences it'd be: 80% of this plot has ZERO, NOTHING, NADA, NULL meaning. It's an awful filler. Our main character is stumbling and bumbling fool. He's frustrating to watch. And you see him for 150 minutes (I wanted to gouge my eyes off at some point). What is important is 1 extremaly short and awkward talk with random man and the final scene. Less than 30 minutes.(I had to redact a sizeable chunk of this review due to it not being PC-friendly enough. Welcome to XXI censorship.)This movie is not ""normal"" or ""fantasy"". It's a ""THEME"" movie that has fantasy flavour.If you disliked movies such as:Manglehorn (starring al pacino, godawful movie)

Midnight sky (george clooney. Same as above. Sci-fi flavour, lick of sense, ""THEME"")you better avoid this one.Oh, about the theme. It's not bad. But it was forcefully shoehorned and had to have whole story twisted and broken around it just so it'd fit... And it didn't, really.",The Green Knight

I think it succeeds magnificently. Its an amazing film visually, managing to genuinely capture a strange unworldly atmosphere, the oddness of the tale, and even something of the message that the anonymous writer was trying to express about Chivalry and romance. The idea that nothing happens is rather ridiculous. It's a richly observed and immersive film, and I think, a great piece of cinema, but I can imagine that it will alienate audiences looking for a more straightforward period action movie. It is I think Dev Patel's best film so far, and the design cinematography and music deserve awards that, on almost all levels, better films that have cost ten times the budget of The Green Night.",The Green Knight

183,legonerdy,The End Makes It,8,1 August 2021,"So, after waiting for over a year, I finally got to see what was - for me - one of the most anticipated movies of the year (after Dune). In short, I thought it was great.The biggest thing that the movie suffers from is whisper dialogue. Like many more art-focused films, the characters spend far too much time refusing to speak up. There is also the issue of title cards. They were distracting. There is also the issue of the overall disjointed narrative. That, however, I can forgive because of the source material. Medieval literature - especially Anglo-Saxon literature - is simply written with kind of structure. Random things just... happen. For instance, the Giants that appear for all of one scene. They do nothing and mean nothing to the plot, but they show up anyway.As for the positives, I have to give major props for the rich style. I've seen people call it style over substance, but I disagree. All the same, it is RICH with style. Yet again, we have a movie I must praise for Costume. Design. Call out to Margosia Turzanska. Also, the set pieces are gorgeous, and the film makes incredible use of color. The atmosphere is rich, the movie has strong themes, but it's the visual storytelling of the finale that made me fall in love. I won't spoil it, but there are at least three levels of symbolism to Gawain's coronation.All in all, a great film. It's slow, and it's narrative is out of place in this day and age, but I thought it was well executed. Solid 7.5, but I LOVE the end, so I'm bumping it to an 8.",The Green Knight

The VVitch
King Arthur: Legend of the Sword
First Reformed""The Green Knight"" is the latest film from my favorite movie studio, A24. They are famous for taking non-mainstream, weird, brave, terrifying, disturbing and overall unusual projects, probably the only big studio out there that is just doing it's own thing and does not get in the way of the filmmaker's vision (Midsommar, Hereditary, Ex Machina, The Lighthouse, The Killing of a Sacred Deer...). I'm always excited for their new projects, and I've been waiting for ""The Green Knight"" for over a year because of how promising it looked, but in the end, it turned out quite disappointing.This is a story of a knight-wannabe on his very first quest, a young man who goes out there to save princesses and slay monster, and to thus prove to the whole world that he is ""worthy""; all that in a moody, dark, eerie medieval setting. Only in this film our ""knight"" has some very real human qualities that distinguish him from all of the other mythical heroes - he is a cowardly weasel, who only tries to look cool while in reality he has no idea what he's doing. He barely struggles through his quests, with each step becoming more and more certain that ""hero"" is the worst possible word to describe him. The goal of the film is to show how annoyed the writer-director is of the traditional cliché portrayal of perfectly brave and glorious heroes, and to sprinkle some human condition in the mix of a medieval knight story. I am usually all in for breaking cliches and thinking outside of the box (like the new approach to horror in The Lighthouse and Midsommar), but it turns out this just doesn't work for a hero archetype story. After seeing something like that you realize that the reason why such stories are idealized and dramatized is because it makes them interesting, compelling and inspiring. This film lacks all of that. I think that this rebellious idea didn't really deserve a movie of it's own, but perhaps a film like ""The Green Knight"" was bound to be made at some point. Either way, making anything similar to it in the future would be utterly pointless, this complaint of an idea is a dead end that is already itself a cliché, after appearing in just this one film.",The Green Knight
190,Tobeshadow,Elegantly different!,8,23 October 2021,"An interesting take on the classic Arthurian legend, The Green Knight has a bold visual style, quite unlike other modern films and Dev Patel is perfect as a knight seeking his honour. There is a great honesty about his acting and you really feel his conviction in every role he takes on. Always great to see Ralph Ineson too, who has a voice and presence that is perfect for the film.It reminded me in places of Valhalla Rising, with flashes of deep colour to accentuate moods and various gels and lighting tricks creating dancing shadows and a great feeling of menace. It will definitely benefit from multiple viewings, as there were somethings I didn't quite understand on first watch, though this had no hindrance on the film.

I just wish Lowery didn't take such liberties to alter the moral of the story. Dev Patel was an interesting choice, but doesn't quite pull off the character. It also smells a little 'woke' to me, but mainly because it also pulls in another actor of color to play Morgan, the sister of King Arthur. Genetics apparently didn't apply back in those days. That aside, the movie is beautifully shot, dark and forboding, reflecting the dread and fear felt by Gawain.

Don't expect there to be much if any action, it's not that kind of movie. The dialogue wasn't cringey or sloppily written. It was very succinct and very powerful.The production value was excellent as it is with most a24 movies. It was an artistic style but the cinematography, the lighting, and the angles were great. Whoever they hired to be the Director of Photography did a good job.Most of the characters were well casted and did a great job. The chemistry seemed there.

196,barberp-49770,Brings King Arthur's Legend to Life in Stunning Detail,10,22 August 2021,"For those unfamiliar with the King Arthur fables, this movie might seem a bit bizarre, or even boring. But it flawlessly executes everything it is trying to do.The Arthurian legend and the chivalric, romantic traditions are brought to life in a kind of grounded surrealism that works perfectly, in my view, with the source material. I was enthralled by this movie.The ending differs from the source material in a pretty major way. Of that there is no doubt. But I would argue that it differs in a good way. It dramatically changes the morality lesson of the fable. But I think this way it tells an even more important lesson, about facing one's mortality with courage. In the original work, Sir Gawain had no idea that the sash would really prevent him from being killed by the Green Knight. It was supposed to be an act of faith in God for him to accept the blow of the Green Knight's axe. In this version, Sir Gawain comes to realize that his integrity and entire purpose for living as a knight depends on honoring the spirit of his bargains, without tricks or rationalizations.If I had to characterize this movie in one sentence....it is like if you combined Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with Apocalypse Now.Sir Gawain's journey becomes a parable for his journey to find meaning to his life. His journey to the Green Knight to fulfill his bargain is one of certain doom, where it is assured this inhuman beast will cut off his head.When he dreams of fleeing from the Green Knight to preserve his life, he sees ahead of him the cost of his choice to abandon his quest: He continues to live on, for a time. But he knows that his death is inevitable regardless of if he flees from his destiny. He may find success if he lives on. He may rule his own kingdom, for a time. But in the end his kingdom crumbles as his body will, too. He lives on to watch his family threatened by the inevitable enemy at the gates. He knows he himself will merely find another end, somewhere else, at some later time. One without honor, where he has contracted away his life to land a blow upon another in an agreed exchange, but betrayed his oathes for his own self-preservation.This is a journey to discovering the code of knighthood. And quite a good one, indeed.",The Green Knight

198,Shadowboy_25cm,"Elegiac, stylized, atmospheric take on a tale about Sir Gawain",8,12 September 2021,"The legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is told. Due to the fact that it is a legend and this material has already been literary and cinematic several times, some things are reinterpreted here based on the legend. Overall, I find the approach very successful, creates a great atmosphere and it is very often told in pictures, still life and without dialogue.A very elegiac film, which is told in a stylized visual language musically accompanied by old folklore and beautiful film music.The film lives on hints, on mysticism and grabs me with its own world. It is indeed an Arturian Middle Ages story, but historically accurate in terms of costumes or architecture, for example, is little in the film. But I do not mind, as I said: The film creates its own world from all the historical and mythical.As a viewer, you have to have a lot of patience for this film. It is the heroic journey of Sir Gawain, who experiences a lot on the way, a kind of road movie, with rather quiet moments than action. Explanations come as good as none. Many things seem incoherent as the hero moves from the reality of King Arthur's court into the wide world and sinks further and further into an in-between world that is more inward-looking than outward-looking.A beautiful film, beautifully constructed, attractive, set to great images and music.Surprised me very positively.",The Green Knight

202,JoelAlexanderr,"Not for everyone, but a thematically fulfilling experience with gorgeous visuals",9,23 August 2021,"Rarely do low-budget indie films come along that build an expansive world with immersive visuals and a grand vision, but THE GREEN KNIGHT makes it look effortless. With a meager 15 million dollar budget, David Lowery's new vision contains some of the most impressive visuals in any film since Covid began. Every single shot resembles a painting from 1300s England brought back to life through modern film. However, while the visuals and immaculate sound design may be what attracts the viewers' senses, it's the mysterious themes and meaningful stops on this perilous journey that make this film one worth checking out.The first thing people must know before they take this odd and often confusing ride is that it is definitely not for everybody. Long periods of time go by in THE GREEN KNIGHT where viewers will have little idea as to what is happening or why. Many of the burning questions one may have do not get answered by the end of the film, and the resolution may leave some wholly unsatisfied with the direction the story takes. However, the weird and often psychedelic path Lowery carves for his film made every second worth it for me, and by the end I could have composed a dissertation on the motifs and morals expressed by Sir Gawain and The Green Knight.The performances are also fantastic all around, with Dev Patel showing off his range as Sir Gawain, Alicia Vikander delivering one of the finest monologues of the year, and Barry Keoghan making a lasting impact with only two scenes.The dreamy atmosphere is part of why THE GREEN KNIGHT sucked me in so much, and while much of this is due to the amazing visual effects and Lowery's impeccable direction, I also credit Daniel Hart's enchanting score. The music adds to the somewhat off-kilter vibe the film exudes, and sometimes it even contradicts the connotation of the actions happening on-screen, giving gentler scenes a feeling of existential dread underneath.THE GREEN KNIGHT is a movie that's difficult to rationalize without spoiling the details of each stop Gawain takes on his tour, but in the end I found this to be one of the more unique and thought-provoking theater experiences of late. I left the theater thinking about my own mortality, whether it is better to live longer and in misery or die young and hungry, and the ways in which hubris can be the downfall of man (those who love Greek literature or works by Homer will adore this film). Despite the oddness of the film, I still felt all of the emotions I needed to feel and will be thinking about the events of the movie for weeks. To me, that means the movie did everything it needed to.A.",The Green Knight
203,TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,One Of The Best Films In What Feels Like Too Long,8,3 August 2021,"After the string of mediocre summer movies I have had to endure, such as Old, Snake Eyes, and Space Jam 2, it's great finally get back to some true cinema. The Green Knight is one of the greatest fantasy adventure stories told within the past few years that really needs to be an influence for movies going forward. This film is not a medieval action movie playing off the King Arthur Legend, like most people will probably expect, it is rather a slow and philosophical journey through a man's search of honor within a strange, mystical world, which we ourselves become immersed in. The cinematography is amazing and nothing short of beautiful to behold, utilizing unique lighting to give it a dreamlike appearance. The movie has quality performances from every single actor in the film, especially Dev Patel, who plays the honor-seeking Sir Gawain, the main character, to perfection. The titular Green Knight is extremely intimidating, yet he also gives off a feeling of wisdom that contrasts with Sir Gawain's spirited personality. The music is fantastic, blending well with the scenes while also giving off the impression that it was made during the same time the movie is set. The imagery in this movie is surreal, fantastical, and overall beautiful, some shots looking like portraits. This movie will most certainly not be for everyone, but for those who go into this movie with an open mind and a little patience, you will be sure to have an experience you won't be forgetting any time soon.",The Green Knight

207,jaredkjacoby,"A Slow, but Enthralling Medieval Fantasy Epic",9,1 August 2021,"Based on a poem from the 14th Century, this story follows King Arthur's nephew, Sir Gawain, who goes to King Arthur's round table for a feast. There, a strange treelike creature called The Green Knight comes in and challenges the court to a game. One of the knights there would have to land a blow on him and win his axe. That person would have to visit the Green Chapel the next Christmas to repay the favor. Gawain does the deed and he goes on an adventure to the chapel a year later.I only saw one trailer of this movie and that was over a year ago, so I had no idea what to expect going into this one. After seeing this film, I will say that The Green Knight is nothing that I expected it to be. I will go ahead and point out and say that this fantasy flick is a slow burn, artsy, story-driven adventure with hardly any action in it. If you are looking for a medieval film with epic battles, you will probably be disappointed. For me, it worked because it felt like no other fantasy film I have ever seen. In spite of the lack of action, this movie still felt as adventurous as any other film based on an Arthurian story. The movie is ultimately about Gawain's journey and how he finds the courage to face the Green Knight. It is also about fear. There are many scenes in the film where Gawain has to overcome his fear to get out of situations. Not all knights are all that brave. There is a lot to unpack in the story in both the dialogue and in the actions of Gawain. The climax is where it really shines in the story department as it goes full-on the consequences of Gawain's actions. It is one of the most frightening third acts I have ever seen. The tone of the film ranges from bleak to whimsical to horror, but it always stays in the fantasy, adventure lane. It works. Watching this film felt like watching a top-tier fantasy television show get expanded upon. The script is just one of the aspects that make The Green Knight such a memorable film.The performances are among the best that I have seen all year. Dev Patel kills it as Gawain. He has the fear in his eyes, the fight in his emotions and the passionate tone in his voice. You can tell by his performance that Gawain is not the typical medieval hero. I was very impressed with Ralph Ineson as the titular Green Knight. His performance comes off as natural and real despite his appearance as a plant-person. I got an old and wise feeling from the Green Knight. That is what I love about these performances. They tell everything I need to know about these characters. Alicia Vikander as Essel is another genuine character and a sweet love interest to Gawain. I did not recognize Vikander at first, so she did a great job. She is also haunting as another character who shows up later. She showed a lot of range from sweetness to scariness here. Even Sean Harris as King Arthur made a big impression on me with his limited screen time. He came off as a wiser King Arthur. Overall, this cast is excellent and they could not have done a better job with their performances.The visuals in this movie are stunning. The costume design is inventive, the set designs look real and the creature designs look amazing. The Green Knight is a crossover between a plant and a person, yet it looks like the Knight is actually there. I think they used practical effects for some of the makeup. The Green Knight did not look CG to me. The cinematography is stunning as well with a few long shots, but most importantly, some insane shots of imagery that look beautiful. The camera movement at the Giants scene blew me away as did a scene earlier that showed the potential fate of Gawain early on. There is also some great use of color to show the environments in their proper tone and setting. One scene in the forest had a yellowish color to represent how deep in the chapel Gawain is in. The only complaint I have technical wise is that some of the lighting is too dark. Some scenes are really hard to make out because of it. Otherwise, this is the technical marvel and even with the dim lighting, it still uses it to pull off some creative shots. This is not even getting into the musical score. This movie quite possibly has the best musical score I have heard in a theater. It enchanted me the whole way through and it felt like I was watching a medieval fantasy epic just from the music alone. It gave me a sense of dread, a sense of wonder and a sense of adventure. This movie was worth the price of admission for this terrific score alone.The Green Knight is a terrific Arthurian epic. It is far from the conventional fantasy adventure film which could turn off some people, but it is brimming with passion, creativity and emotion. The movie shows that you do not need a fast paced story to deliver an unforgettable adventure. This is one movie that is definitely worth experiencing on the big screen, but beware that it may not be the fantasy filM you expect it to be.",The Green Knight

213,rob-broekhof-1,"It's necessary to learn from amended old ""jokes""",7,27 August 2021,"Any joke is good, even if just one of a 100 people laughed. Especially when I was the one laughing. Still, this is not a joke. This is a miracle story and it is necessary.The original is a poem which is thought to have been written in the period 1350 - 1400.My enthusiasm for this version of how the story from the poem is ""told"" in the movie, came after I read more about the poem itself. According to Wikipedia the end is as follows:begin of quote -The next day, Gawain binds the sash around his waist. Outside the so-called Green Chapel, only an earthen mound containing a cavern, he finds the Green Knight sharpening an axe. As promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing, Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn't flinch with the second swing; but again, the Green Knight withholds the full force of his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet, and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be none other than the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the ""elderly lady"" Gawain saw at the castle, who is the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's stepsister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. The nick Gawain suffered at the third stroke was because of his attempt to conceal the gift of the sash. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the sash as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth each will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest. - end of quote -In this version, i.e. In the movie, while the Green Knight attempts to behead Gawain, Gawain flees to return home. Over the years he experiences a growing despair. He was crowned king and after a difficult period he's about to be lynched by the people of his own kingdom. Before that happens he sits on his thron and removes the sash - that he had received to keep him from all physical harm - from his waist and his head falls on the floor.THEN, suddenly Gawain is back with the Green Knight and he bowed his head to be beheaded. The Green Knight is about to behead Gawain but Gawain asks him to wait and removes the sash from his waist and says he's ready. Then the Green Knight kneels down beside Gawain and says: ""Well done, my great knight"". While he points towards/over Gawain's head he says with a smile: ""Now ... off with your head"" and ... the movie has ended.A fore sign of this scene was displayed earlier in the movie when Gawain was robbed and tied up during his journey to the Green Chapel. It seemed that he had not found the courage to get untied to be able to move on. After a 360 degree turn of the camera his skeleton was still laying there, in the same clothes and pose. But then the camera moved on to show that Gawain freed himself to proceed.The miracle to me is the fact that it took more than 620 years before some people figured out that removing the sash is essential. To me the sash represents fear and removing is surrendering to becoming fearless. It's not about being honest. It's about being fearless, because people without fear are honest by default. To me this is a great message that's very necessary these days.So why did I give this a mere seven of ten. The cinematography was stunning, simply beautiful, so that's not the reason why I gave it a lower rating than it deserved. But, to me it was painful to sit through because of the slowness and the music. Slowness and music is necessary just like salt in food. But even for me (as an old geezer from 61) it was way too much.What I appreciated especially was the fore sign displayed in the following quote from this movie; a dialogue between Essel and Gawain before he leaves for his journey:Essel: Are you really going to go?Gawain: Should I?Essel: I like your head better where it is.Gawain: I gave my word. I made a covenant.Essel: This is how silly men perish.Gawain: Or how brave men become great.Essel: Why greatness? Why is goodness not enough?It may not be necessary to watch the whole movie to grasp it's necessity. Anyway, it's really worth watching when you're patient and keep the volume low. 😉",The Green Knight

218,ChrisInMiami,The Green Knight is high art and simultaneously questionable entertainment,8,9 August 2021,"SYNAPSIS
On the surface this telling of The Green Knight is a story of Gawain, King Arthur's nephew, a 20-something loaf-about and his desire to be a better person. Per the original story he is tricked into a challenge with the Green Knight where they will trade one sword blow each, a year apart. Gawain takes the first swing and decapitates the Green Knight but discovers he has been tricked when the felled Knight picks up his own head and rides off laughing. As the next year ends and Gawain journeys to meet the Green Knight to receive his blow, he encounters threats and hardships that reveal his personal shortcomings and the harsh realities of a world he has so far avoided.ANALYSIS
It is a beautiful looking movie with amazing set design, costumes, acting and atmosphere, worth seeing in theaters for that alone. But be warned it is not a straight forward adventure flick... it is a self discovery story with a narrative full of encounters steeped in allegory and symbolism so ambiguously broad and deep... maybe no one but the director really gets it all. That may appeal to some but I think mass audiences will not be entertained.MILD SPOILERS
Whereas the original story is a traditional epic, wherein Gawain rejects seduction and meets all challenges in kind, in this telling he is inept, aware of his flaws and yet continually failing each test, be it physical, emotional, or psychological.This movie is high art and simultaneously questionable entertainment. But once again I applaud A24 for supporting this film-maker in his vision. It seems they are the only studio willing to support art-house/avant-garde films of this type and they MUST be made.",The Green Knight
219,johnpmoseley,What a dumb film. Who the heck gave the Green Knight the green light?,1,25 September 2021,"Some of the bad reviews here could almost be describing a film I'd love. Great cinematography, long passages of nothing much plus some trippy stuff you can't understand? What, is this going to be some fantastic mash-up of Kelly Reichardt and A Field in England?No such luck. It's way too overblown for that. Something of profound significance is supposed to be going on here, as you can tell from the endlessly moody rainswept look and the relentless droning mummery of the choral score. But not, really, from the script. Something about a young man beginning to make is way in the world, probably; cutting the, oddly green, umbilical cord, maybe. And it's all just a game, as the king tells him, but you gotta play 'cos otherwise, what you gonna do, right? (Try to earn a crust and keep a roof over our heads if you're most of us, but I guess that doesn't apply to these aristocrats).Pfff. So, why should we care? There's oddly not that much at stake, which makes the heavy tone of portent all the harder to bear. If it's a game, would it kill you to just be a bit playful? You could start by taking off the damn gun metal blue-grey sheen you've drowned almost everything in in the colour grading. You could lose the epic camerawork completely and take some visual cues from the much more modest but interesting medieval artwork you show from time to time (and maybe also from Valerian Borowczyk's 'Blanche,' a film that does the medieval look really well). And if someone's got to be portentous, let it be the self-important teenage protagonist and make a little gentle fun of that.God I hated this. I wish I could use swearwords to drive the point home. It is not good and it is not, contra so many other reviews here, redeemed by the visuals, which are - I realise I'm in danger of repeating myself - not suitable for the subject, not interesting or sensitively handled, and look, for a film leaning much towards artsiness, pretty conventional.Plus the script is rubbish and makes no sense. Is it really all just a game? The fox companion doesn't seem to think so, but then it seems the fox is wrong. But this kind of back and forth nonsense is all over this, seemingly just to string out the otherwise simple story. Like, oh no, he's lost the green band that was supposed to keep him safe, oh cool, someone's randomly given him it back, but no, the ultimate point is for him to realise he doesn't need it? Well, then wouldn't it have been a lot more interesting if he'd near killed himself getting it back before that?",The Green Knight

One day you're enjoying a popcorn blockbuster and wishing for a thoughtful dramatic masterpiece and then the next you're sitting in a thoughtful dramatic masterpiece ,that you so craved, only to be wishing it was a little more popcorn. My experience with ""The Green Knight"" went exactly that way. It's visuals are stunning, it's score superb, the directing is perfect and unfortunately the entire thing is drawn out and boring. David Lowery took an ambitious idea, turning the late 14th-century Middle English chivalric romance ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" into a full length movie, and shot it like a moving painting. That aspect works wonders and for that alone it works. But is it a good movie? Sadly, no it's not. There just isn't enough there narratively or structurally to hold you mentally within it. It will intrigue the most hard-core film fans to keep watching, but for the casual watchers it will infuriate. Lingering shots of Characters waiting do not help with this, although I get the intent, it can be as much a test of patience for the viewer as the character must endure.

233,kuner-59029,Enough with the race tokenism,3,25 August 2021,"This film presents medieval England as a multiethnic place with are Chinese, Black and Indians abound. Utter nonsense.Yes, I get it, it's a fantasy film, but it's supposed to take place in a real place. This pathological urge to inject present day demographics and politics into movies needs to stop. What's next? A samurai film with black samurai? A Nubian empire movie with white Nubians? A movie about Ghandi with Ghandi played by a native American? Ridiculous.However, I'm here to judge the movie, not merely its casting. The movie has some great aspects. Most of the acting is excellent, though it suffers from poor sound mixing. As many have mentioned, the photography and production design are gorgeous, even if some of the CGI looks bad (like the opening shot of all things). But even with an abundance of eye candy to marvel at, the movie drags... and drags... and drags. Shots linger for 3 times as long as they need to. The minimalist score doesn't help either. Oftentimes the film feels like watching paint dry. One could edit it down to 30 minutes and have the entire narrative intact. Yes, I know, it's not that kind of movie.

Very vibrant and colorful, but at the same time the art doesn't stop there, from the dialogue and the long shots of Gawain on his journey, the art quality keeps it incredibly colorful and unique in it's own right.However, I feel like the shots were just a bit too long and drawn in some cases and in others it was too quick to have fully grasped what we were seeing. There was so much detail and lack of it.

242,shabanavdulaj,Lowery makes a statement here!,9,19 August 2021,"Ah, finally, the first noteworthy new film after quite a while. I had this film buried in my watchlist for more than a year now, and lately, after the rave reviews that got from almost everyone, my need for watching it was soaring wild. A24 kept this from sliding it into any streaming platform and released it in cinemas only when the pandemic situation got a little ""safer"" because they were confident in the product they had in their hands. They knew how grand this is, and they wouldn't settle for passing it as a random release. And they were right! Part Tolkien, part Bergman, and part Lynch, 'The Green Knight' is a refreshing take on the medieval genre that merges both modern and old in creating a highly original, captivating cinematic delight.Lowery is one of the most uncompromising directors working today. The unique, highly unconventional 'A Ghost Story' shows hints of the type of filmmaker he is as he goes into making a movie most directors wouldn't dare even think of doing. And yet, even though 'A Ghost Story' was original and uncompromising throughout, I feel like it didn't fully flash out Lowery's immense ingenuity. It would have to be this last film, the one that distinguishes and turns him into one of the most exciting contemporary directors. Here, David takes the adventure-fantasy genre and decomposes it to the point of throwing out the window the genre's crucial tropes.So when I think of ""adventure-fantasy,"" 'The Lord of the Rings' comes quickly to mind (obviously), and although 'The Green Knight' shares some DNA with it, for the most part, it differs a lot. What separates Lowery's medieval fantasy from what has come before in this genre is the lack of a clear, cohesive plot. The element of ""cause and effect"" is not fully embraced here. Things would happen, and they will not immediately get along with your common sense. A lot it's left in shadow. Lowery doesn't hold your hand throughout this film. Instead, he kicks you in the nuts and makes a run for it. David wants you to let the movie wash over you. He wants to trigger your intuition rather than your harsh, sound judgment. And you can read and interpret a lot in the way he does that, or you can shrug it off like shambolic and vague. I defend the first idea. I think that being ambiguous can swap with ease from a genial approach to a pretentious mess. But Lowery's poetic eye is not to be underestimated. He fills and riches the film with delicate symbolism, as he does in that magnificent shot that flips the landscape upside down as the protagonist was walking. You can interpret that as a parallelization of the transformation the protagonist was about to go through. But this is one of the ""light"" stylizations Lowery comes up with because, at times, he would go to almost Lynchian levels of surrealism here.What I also found interesting here was Patel's performance. And this is another aspect that differentiates 'The Green Knight' from other medieval fantasy. 'The Green Knight' is not your typical adventure fantasy in how personal to the protagonist this journey is. We aren't dealing with the end of the world here, but with one's quest in responding to the honor, he so effortlessly gained. So it's a more intimate story and one that leaves room for the actor portraying the protagonist to take perfect charge and show himself. And Patel did so by delivering a sincere and vulnerable performance. As for the looks, the film is a visual wonder. I'm going to leave it at that. Ah, note that if you watch this during the daytime, I hope you have very dark curtains.'The Green Knight' might not be the most accessible film you can come across. Lowery's odd spin on the genre lets a lot of room open for interpretations. The film is challenging to say the least. Alongside the shallowish plot, there's also the slow pace that demands patience. So, I think that most of the audience won't celebrate this, but I loved it. The ground of philosophy Lowery steps upon here - and he does it with such a simple premise - it's unbelievable! I was expecting this film to be good, but at the same time, I was a bit skeptical about it, and what a surprise I got. It's like Lowery received guidance through some divine intervention from Bergman himself. What an ending! - can't stop thinking about this!",The Green Knight

The Green Knight is a story about the honor and misery that befall someone, it is carefully crafted, extremely deep, and with engaging performances to boot. It has one of the best medieval settings And the soundtrack is exquisite.While I personally think it is outstanding from all appearances, I understand that these types of movies are not for everyone. Just because you don't understand the narrative doesn't mean the movie is objectively bad. I mean, just LOOK AT IT. Even if the story doesn't catch you, you can't deny that it looks absolutely charming and I predict that some kind of courage will come out of it. For each his own thought. I highly recommend The Green Knight, but you need to know what you're getting into and prepare to think. The results may surprise you. It certainly amazed me once everything lined up.

255,tarynabryant,"If you need to fall asleep, watch this.",5,31 July 2021,"I'll start by saying that visually, this movie is stunning and it has some moments of great acting. That's about the extent of the positives. As an avid fan of A24, I was very excited for The Green Knight and tried to go into it with as open a mind as possible. I wasn't expecting a horror or action movie. I went in simply expecting to be told a story. I anticipated that it would be on the slower side, but wow. I feel so guilty for saying this seeing as so many people loved the film, but it was way too boring for me to enjoy. I have loved the slow-burn approach that A24 has taken with other movies like The Witch and The Lighthouse, but The Green Knight just didn't have enough substance to keep me engaged in what was going on. Every time something significant seemed to happen, it would be followed by an agonizingly long shot of a forest with loud, eerie music playing over it. Furthermore, this movie is DARK. Like literally dark. I couldn't see who was on the screen or what was happening for at least 30% of the movie. As for the other 70% that I could actually see, I had literally no idea what was going on. What's the meaning of those giant gray naked people? Why did everyone want to kiss Dev Patel? Beats me. Maybe that's my fault because i'm not very familiar with the story of Gawain and the Green Knight, but I consider myself a generally thoughtful person who makes an effort to understand complex films. I spent the entire drive home mentally analyzing this movie and still had no idea what any of it meant until I read some online articles explaining the story. I really wanted to love this movie and I wish I could understand why it is receiving such praise, but both my friend and I left the theater feeling very underwhelmed and sleepy. I've also noticed that a lot of these rave reviews are coming from people who are likely pretentious arthouse film lovers who somehow think they are better than everyone else, since they all seem to think that anyone who didn't enjoy this movie is ultimately ""unintelligent"". As one review states, ""all negative reviews are from people who should have stayed home with a bud light and watched South Park"".

The whole reason the story is still remembered to this day is the message. Hollywood yet again can't comprehend moral messages they don't personally follow and completely changed this one.The acting was good. The style of the movie was artistic and interesting, but made it very slow and so dark it was hard to make out what was going on. So much of this movie was unexplained, what were the witches' powers and why was she doing things? That applies for several characters. It ended up being a random bunch of events strung together for little apparent reason. The lord and lady of the castle scene was changed to be pointless and gross.

258,stefan_papp,"If you want to watch a medieval movie, you chose wrong....",8,7 November 2021,"The Green Knight is a fantasy movie. It contains tons of mythological elements. Although it starts with Christmas, it is clear that we have tons of fantastic elements that one might rather find in various sagas and pagan myths (giants, magic etc.).The movie is slow paced and full of symbolism. If someone loves to discuss what one or the other scene could mean, it has tons of elements to speculate about. What is the theme? Is it mostly about honor? What does the green band represent? Or the knight himself? And all the figures. Or what kind of king is the Green Knight? The longer the movie gets, the more one can speculate.I personally see Gawain as a flawed man who tries to live values of chivalry. But in the end, he learns to reject chivalry - instead of becoming the perfect knight (by fulfilling his duty) - he would fail and as a king lose everything.So what was he destined to be be? The perfect knight? Was it pride that let him get into his initial conflict. He could have turned down the offer of the green knight or not harm him. What does his offer in the end mean? He will die, but he dies as a brave man.",The Green Knight

268,cmantafounis,The Green Knight,6,7 November 2021,"One of those films where you leave the theatre with countless feelings, none quite yet clear enough to put into coherent sentences, and as such a second viewing feels essential - if The Green Knight did anything right, it is surely the case that it will pervade my thoughts for a while. Thematically breathless: a deconstruction of the hero's journey and storytelling itself, exemplified by the stunning final sequence; yet equally a mythologised commemoration of chivalry, honour and bravery; but, further still, also a revisionist reading of the inherent misogyny in Arthurian legend, framed through various sexual encounters and our hero's figurative impotence; beyond all that, a rumination on the inevitability of death and the constant weight felt under that knowledge. This admirable breadth is both its greatest strength and biggest downfall - the film is about all of these topics and many more (there are sure to be numerous analyses made dissecting every frame in a vain hope for some unifying subtext), but as a result feels as though it isn't really saying anything. It's all so disjointed, left vague to the perfect degree yet still inexplicably unsatisfying. On paper it has all the right elements - whilst watching, however, I am entirely disinterested. The stanza-like structure is initially compelling but becomes stagnant and repetitive, with the gradual declination into surrealism only muddying things further. Several odd editing choices as well. Often appealing visually, if mostly vapid in its overly familiar A24-gothic-horror aesthetic, a grossly desaturated colour palette being the worst offender. Shows brilliance in small bursts; the lengthy, wordless montage to finish is spectacular, with the actual ending hitting the right note to leave viewers with plenty to chew on. Performances were solid across the board, Patel himself communicating a lot throughout solely by his facial expressions. Loved the music, too. This review has ended up as incoherent as the film itself; hopefully a second watch will clarify my thoughts and whether or not the disorderly themes match the uneven plotting. For now, I can say that there are many interesting patches, but nothing quite unifying it all.",The Green Knight

It's gorgeous. Almost every scene in this movie was shot so well - there will be a lot of wallpaper / shot compilation videos made. The scene with Winfred was BREATHTAKING.The soundtrack was beautiful and added so much emotion and emphasis to the scenes.The set designs and costume designs are great as well.The story is very ambiguous. When you look at the overall story, from start to finish, it is a story of Gawain's journey. However when you take a Closer look.... there are a lot to think of / interpret. And I am still not entirely sure about how to interpret certain parts of the movie.But do we really need to understand EVERYTHING? Is there any room for ambiguity?Think of a puzzle. When you complete a very complex puzzle, youre gonna feel like you accomplished something, and you will feel very good / proud of urself.But would you go back to work on that puzzle again? You might for fun, but you will never get the same feeling of working on that puzzle for the first time. The feeling of ambiguity and blindness.And I feel like when you are so obsessed with trying to interpret & find meaning in Everything.. you may forget to enjoy / appreciate the film itself.And I think Green Knight will (at least for me) be a film that I appreciate / like for its mysterious vibe and ambiguity..... and its beautiful visuals.Check this one out.

283,herrbrett,Different in a good way,10,23 August 2021,"It's not an easy watch like pop culture movies like Avengers. There are many cheesy jokes and likable characters. But this movie is AMAZING. It is trippy at times, but it is what the movie teaches you that sets it apart. Watching it is the closest I have come to reading Shakespeare. It's not always easy, but the deeper meanings truly stuck with me. This movie is a feast of philosophy.For fans of cinema, this is a GREAT movie. Truly blown away at how much I thought about this movie when I was done with it. I came to IMDb to find out who this director is.

Camera angles panning slowly, stairs being climbed seemingly in slow motion - and where you'd think it would build to a crescendo... it doesn't.I just do not understand why such a cast could be duped in to making a movie where NOTHING happens.Unfortunately for me, I have to finish all the movies I watch... but after this, I may need to have a rethink.",The Green Knight

A general screenwriting rule when it comes to arcs, a character is pushed to internally change because of EXTERNAL conflict. What drives Gawain to choose courage over giving into fear? A daydream. I wouldn't mind a shorter sequence (like the end of La La Land that imagines a life where Mia and Sebastian end up together, or Parasite where Ki-woo dreams of getting rich enough to buy the house his dad is stuck in) but the sequence here felt like it was...30 minutes? More? A significant chunk of the movie. Enough time to piss you off and waste your time. The lesson here is, keep your fantasy/dream sequences short.",The Green Knight
288,sfworthington,A Film of Woe and Wonder,8,29 September 2021,"A mysterious Arthurian tale of woe that feels more like a meditative dream than an exciting adventurous tale.With a constant sense of grandeur permeating every shot, you are really able to feel the magic you expect from a mythic tale such as this. The Green Knight isn't a typical story of adventure and chivalry however, it's much more ambiguous than that and seems to pose more questions than it does answer. But this definitely doesn't serve as a hinderance as David Lowry makes it very clear, in his vision, that he is stylising his epic tale with mystery. He wants you to think.We get an exploration into Pagan values which base around the idea that the world driven by honour and chivalry will always be overruled by nature, the natural force that is too powerful to control, this idea is sprinkled throughout the plot for example the Lady of the Castle has a monologue in which she expresses these ideas. Although at surface level these ideas don't have much resonating ability to a modern audience, it's not the ideas that resonate with you, it's the experience. This film feels like a hazy lucid dream, which constantly leave you in a state of awe. It's an interesting watch as this film has the ability to move you and to really take you somewhere else, yet I can't put my finger on what the reason to that is. Maybe an opportunity to escape into a complete other worldly place of dark magic may simply be the reason, but the film's got a lot more substance than that. If I was asked to describe this film I would say it's as if Ingrid Bergman directed Pan's Labyrinth. In fact saying this film is a combination of Pan's Labyrinth and The Seventh Seal is a strikingly accurate description.Although this is a tale that dabbles with magic, spells and curses the film is also driven by human emotion. We have the typical story of an unheroic character striving for heroism. There is more risk than potential pay off and that makes for an engaging lead character. When Gawain sets off on his mission there is no way in telling if he will be successful or not. In Gawain partaking in this pursuit for honour we see him question his own morality and mortality. It poses the universal question of can we control our own fate or is it completely out of of our hands. Lowry really puts the physical world and the philosophical world in a direct yet profound conflict and it makes for such an interesting and hypnotising watch, as we all have questioned the limits of the world we live in and the capabilities of ourselves. It most definitely is one of the most impressive films of the year, for visuals alone, so i highly recommend.",The Green Knight
289,bcnkor,A medieval European knight like Hindu doesn't even glue,1,29 October 2021,"I used unreal casting, a plastic looking ax, a ridiculous crown, and very slow sequences throughout the film.Lots of new technology that falls short of a great 1984 Green Knight movie with Sean Connery.",The Green Knight
290,aciarleglio-1,I wanted to love this movie.,2,21 August 2021,"I love King Arthur, myths, legends, dark tales, fantasy, etc... I wanted a great Green Knight adventure! Instead all we got was um a story where nothing really happened? I mean literally nothing. The lesson was there. The concept was there. The plot as in the original story all available to draw from and instead we got absolutely none of that. Not even a sword fight. I'm not sure how the director tricked himself into thinking this was a good telling of the tale. I read an interview were he points out Willow as an inspiration of what he likes about fantasy films. Well call me crazy but I'd watch Willow 1 million times over before I'd watch this movie again. I hate giving bad reviews because I respect the hard work that goes into creating, but seriously this was one of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched.",The Green Knight
291,ascendant01,Hopefully read these reviews before wasting you time and money,2,23 August 2021,"I rented this movie because the trailers made it sound like some story from the knights of the round table. They open the movie with Sir Gawain at the round table and called before the king and quee. Then some unknown called the GREEN KNIGHT comes a knocking and delivers a message and then says he is there for a game and challenges any knight to try and actually touch him in a duel . The King asks for volunteers and there is a long pregnant moment when no one speaks up to volunteer until Gawain says he will do it. This GREEN KNIGHT says if you can strike me with a blow in one year hence you must come to his chapel and he will deliver HIS blow in return and exactly as he was struck. Gawain goes into the well to fight the green knight and instead of fighting the green knight lays down his war axe and spreads his arms in surrender to allow Gawain to strike him. Unthinking and not very swift on the uptake Gawain lops off the Green knight's head, now meaning the he will get HIS head lopped off in exactly one year. And then as Gawain turns to the King, the headless Green Knight gets up and bends over and picks up his head. As he holds his head the eyes open and he states the obvious, that he will expect Gawain at his chapel in a year and then he remounts his large Destrier and rides out of the hall and away, laughing maniacally. Now this is as much as I can tell you about the movie plot, not because of any restriction, but rather because I do not understand a damn thing after that other than to say the Trailers and advertising were very disingenuous. After that scene there is no more knights of the round table and all the scenes after that are more on a tactical level of a story and none of them were giving any strategic level information about about the story. All the rest of the scenes were like little disconnected stories and not really connected to the story as a whole.Anyway, that is how I saw it. I think the acting and actors were superb, as were the sets but the story was disjointed and lacked a clear explanatory path to an ending. I would say don't waste your money or your time here. The movie script just did not measure up to the actors in it.",The Green Knight

293,shivnarang,Journey Of The Brown Knight !!,8,2 August 2021,"The Green Knight kinda broke my brain during the first viewing. I got about 70% of what the movie was about but was not really sure or confident of that 70% as well. So, I had to view it again and now I can say that I understand about 85% of the movie and the remaining 15% still eludes me and I guess that's the beauty of it.This movie is beautiful and strange at the same time. It is shot wonderfully and is gorgeous to look at. The Cinematography is breathtaking and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination. The camera work, the set design, the costumes and the VFX all come together to creat this fantasy world that will leave you mesmerized and bewildered. The last time a movie did this to me was The Lighthouse (2019).As someone who has in the past not been a fan of Dev Patel's acting, I feel he did a brilliant job here. This is Dev Patel's career's best performance so far and he also deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. I enjoyed both Alicia Vikander and Joel Edgerton's performances as well. Rest of the cast plays more of a supporting role to Dev Patel and do their parts competently.This movie is not for everyone. It's a slow burn and is very cryptic. It shows you things that may or may not be happening and leaves it totally for you to interpret it however you want it to. And that can be really fascinating for some people and make them want to see it again to decode it, like it did for me. Or it can also make you lose interest in the middle of the movie and not care for it at all. Either way, I say give it a chance, it might end up surprising you.",The Green Knight

I remember watching the original to this film and, even given it's flaws, appreciating the idea, the story. To be honest I was apprehensive about this remake but I am glad to say I watched it. This film was done the way films used to be done but have been seemingly forgotten...through art. Look, this film was done for actual film lovers. Individuals who actually look at film as an art form. Individuals whos make base on the story, the characters and such. Not for how many ""CGI"" explosions there are ""bad ass"" moments.

Ever. It just goes on and on against a backdrop of greys and greens, a soupy backdrop to the endless boredom. Sure, there are classical references to tease the most pretentious sensibilities and a cast of famous actors, all of whom seem to be reading from a different script, but as one critic says it takes ""patience"" to appreciate the layered significance, meaning you'll have to sit through two hours of very little happening and a sonorous sound track to appreciate the artiness of it all.

The former is to the point and means precisely what one sees on the canvas. The latter, however, go beyond the forms and structures painted on the canvas. They invoke complex poetic feelings, teleport you to a different universe, and make you observe, question and think about a lot of things. If movies were paintings, The Green Knight would belong to the 2nd category.I happen to enjoy immensely an Infinity War as well as an Eraserhead (lucky me). But some enjoy only one of them. This movie is meant for those who love the latter. Especially those who enjoy the movies that are artistic, intelligent, but lack a definitive form or don't serve naïve answers. The movie has the best in class direction, cinematography, imagery, music, dialogues, and acting.

328,jovejovejupiter,Cynical modern vision of arthurian knights,8,11 August 2021,"The film is different from the source poem, one of the biggest differences being the inplicit view of Knighthood. In the poem the rules of being a knight are taken very seriously and Gawain experiences serious shame when breaking a rule.In the film version the Knights and Arthur himself are essentially seen as mostly blowing a bunch of hot air about morals and honor while doing as they please. In one of the first scenes of the movie Arthur admits to basically neglecting his family his whole life and only making an effort once he is old and weak.Patel's character Gawain is portrayed as a shallow, dreaming but still insecure aspiring knight. He spends night drinking and sleeping with his peasant girlfriend, and when given the chance brutally slays the defenceless Green Knight. He is hailed as a hero, taking accolades and celebrity with him on a year of drinking and partying before the required rematch.Gawain then faces a series of situations while on his quest to seek out the knight. In each instance he proves how selfish and shallow he really is. He never just offers up service as a knight is supposed to do, he asks others for things or accepts from others without any intention of giving back. He basically breaks most of the core tenets of the Knightly code.Finally, at the end after seeing through a flash forward how his life as a coward would turn out Gawain accepts his fate and binds himself to his word.Although the ending is left to interpretation I think this version of Gawain deserves to die. He basically showed no honor or growth throughout the film and if he was spared at the end it would basically be the ""magical single quest"" to gain honor which was mentioned by the Noble Lord character earlier in the film.I thought the characters were decently well developed unlike some other commentors. Gawain's vain, glory seeking character was obvious and other characters motives could be understood by reading through the lines a bit. I am the kind of person who enjoye making up a bit of character backstory for myself if it is not explocitly given. For example for Morgana (Gawain's mother, the witch) I inferred her motivation when calling the Green Knight to be a way to fast track Gawain and herself to the throne since Arthur was declining. In particular the magical girdle made me think Morgana fully expected Gawain to be a coward. Also at the end the Green Knight congratulates Gawain for taking off the girdle which to me implies that the Knight knew what it was since Morgana coerced the Knight into offering the challenge in the first place and was inpressed with Gawain for defying his mother's low view of him.The film was quite slow and dark visually but overall the cinematography was very strong. At one part in particular I found myself wondering if the theater screen was damaged since it looked so blurry due to fog. I am a big soundtrack guy so this film was perfect for me. As other commentors have noticed the film does lean heavily on the soundtrack to give emotion and pace, but for me it works.While definitely not a blockbuster action-adventure, as someone who mainly watches blockbusters I was not bored at all. I did expect a swordfight or two and got none, but I was still engaged with the movie and the second to last sequence of flashbacks does offer a bit of a faster paced payoff if you are patient.",The Green Knight

I'm not really familiar with the source material that the movie is based on but I think people are allowed to have their own interpretations. There are no objective rules here, a lot of people just don't expect to go in to an artsy sword and sorcery movie with such a leisurely pace. I really enjoyed the pace and I think this movie is best viewed at home from a nice comfortable couch or a bed. Not that it will put you to sleep but you will be in the right mood to leave all stress behind as well as your sense of time.This movie offers a very good experience immersing you in the world of stunning visuals, there is plenty of feeling of awe and wonder and magic.

All of that adds to a 6/10. But where this movie pitfalls is the STORY. It is simply incomprehensible...as in, impossible to follow. I almost wonder if that's intended? However for such a long film it's easy to lose the audience (we certainly had plenty in our theater getting up for bathroom/snack breaks). After thinking it over, it made more sense, but while you're watching it, you'll find yourself pretty lost.I was extremely excited for this movie & determined to see it in theaters, however I knew 15 minutes in that I'd made a mistake. This film is also depressing & slow. I expected it to be a gritty drama based on the period & source material, but it's more than that.

The film is a unique, fantasy re-telling of the Medieval Arthurian tale, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Sir Gawain, top form & attractively played by actor Dev Patel, is King Arthur's foolhardy nephew, who goes on a quest to take down the Green Knight in order to obtain both his courage and gain favor in the eyes of the King. Along the journey, Sir Gawain is faced with obstacles, including thieves, ghosts, sci-fi looking giants and sexually charged nefarious characters. Very good in their supporting roles are Alicia Vikander (dual role Essel/The Lady), Joel Edgerton (The Lord) and Sarita Choudhury (Morgan le Fay-Gawain's Mother).

348,platon_mp,This is cinema...and let me explain!,10,26 August 2021,"Historically we can say that cinema is the tip if the iceberg at arts. It all started from the greek tragedy and in the recent 200 years it developped to opera and theater before cinema starts to pop out 50 years ago as an extension of those arts. In fact opera was considered by many the greatest form of art because u could combine each of the 6 arts in 1 big creation that Wagner called drama. Each one holds an equal amount of significance and was taken equally into account in order to evaluate the drama-opera. For example music was as important or more as the plot.In the big screen some rules may have changed like actors dont have to speak loud or sing but there are general criteria that have formed over the 200 years of what is acceptable and what is not, and most of them applying to the cinema. Basically im saying that 90% of the people who gived low rating to this movie dont have the capacity to evaluate this kind of filmmaking since it has elements of older crafts, like Wagners dramaOther issue is that the dominance of series in our days did massive damage to films because people compare those 2 applying the same principles. In a series the most important factor is the plot because it follows a story. In the movie thats not the case. Movie is art and art is expression, its a feeling , its nature, a subconsious message that may trigger some buttons at our brain that we cant explain, and thats ok.Today we want everything oversimplified, the food in our plate, comfort, entertainment. We reject something that makes us feel discomfort, the unpleasant, weird. In the world that made the most of progress at explaining everything we hate when we cant understand something, when its out of our comfort zone. However this is when magic happens. These kind of movies you have to feel them, not watching with pythagorian logic, not trying to force reason inside them.I m not saying this movie is good or bad yet im sure that the music is legendary and every frame could be set as wallpaper. Its different from everything i ve ever seen and deserves a proper audience, not some people who were bragging in the reviews about how they left the cinema in the middle of the movie (propably to continue scrolling on instagram), saying that they wasted their PRECIOUS time that they waste in rubbish anyway.Those should go home and get hyped about the next spiderman.

I won't dwell on this, but have to say I don't know what is it with ""The Green Knight"" that people failed to find. Was it boredom? Frustration? Failed expectations? All of the above? I taught Medieval English literature for a few years at college and one of my favourite (if not the favourite) piece of writing was ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"". I mention this because the standards with the things we love are always higher and rarely reached. Having said that, I couldn't have been more content with this adaptation - it's as beautiful a take on this period as anything I've seen since ""Excalibur"" (far from it being merely an aesthetic pleaser, for the content is equally rewarding, with successful characters, believable dialogue and pace that allows it to breathe while moving forward; it's a movie that knows what it is and what it wants and, unlike so many modern projects, is void of cynicism, almost piously respectful of the topics it tackles, which is the right approach, the only approach for it to succeed and create something of lasting quality. Patel is as good as ever, and I found comfort in his face as much as I did in the sights and sounds of his quest, humanity and history intertwined like the Green Knight's physique.

The sash is soiled with semen because it represents blah blah blah. Symbols are less, not more, effective if you literalize them. The meanings of green and red dialog is cringey and obvious stoned dorm room chatter. Shouldn't the movie's theses of the meaning of the green in Green Knight be present in the imagery of the story? It is a movie, after all, not a blog post. Sure, why not rip off the last act of The Last Temptation of Christ, since like Christ Gawain is self-sacrificing?

There's a reason for 3-act setup, and while it's not mandatory for every act to uphold it, it does teach you that there should be some order and resolution. This does not have order, and the resolution is far too ""free handed"" compared to the legend. It's as if the ending of the legend was skewed to serve the purpose of sending a message that director had set even before shooting the first frame.

Though whoever does so will have the same blow enacted upon him by the knight in a years time.After stepping to the plate and striking the Knight with what would ordinarily have been a fatal hit, Gawain watches on in horror as picks up his own head and departs reminding Gawain of his oath to receive the same blow in 12 months time. So begins the trials of Gawain as we skip straight to the beginning of his journey to visit the chapel housing the knight far to the north.It is here where the movie presents a series challenges and experiences for Gawain to face on his path. A path which will either confirm his knightly virtues or end in dishonor.For the viewing audience this may present a challenge of its own given the scarcity of this particular story in popular culture and how it reflects upon the history of the time. Both of which will only appeal to a niche audience.It is a movie which will benefit from multiple viewings imo and should be approached with a mature and open mind.

It's a good movie, but it's quiet, dark, and slow. Most of the film is dimly shot in what seems like natural low light, there could have been 30 - 40 minutes of near-silence cut out (I'm not exaggerating), and other scenes could have had more of that appealing soundtrack. I'm sure an editor could have done more with some of these long, still shots, but it was odd having so many moments in the film waiting for something to happen.I also wish this movie leaned more into its lacking fantasy elements. A bizarre fantasy world stands at the edges of this film, but it wasn't fully realized, possibly because of budget constraints. You get glimpses of it in CGI characters and actions, but it doesn't feel like enough. However, I will say the Green Knight was a terrific character depiction next to Gawain.So that's most of the bad. The good thing is, if you like what you saw in the trailers, that's what you're getting here. It's weird, artsy, self-indulgent, thoughtful, and brooding. It's a modern re-interpretation of an old story using all the dressings of today's art-house films. You have your unusual tilting shots, creepy music, multiple nightmare, and dream sequences, overtly long yet poetic monologues, and forced (but realistic) awkward silences between close family and friends.Throughout the film, there's this uneasiness that you would typically experience in the suspense or horror genre, but it works well here. Gawain knows what's waiting for him but doesn't know what could potentially stop or kill him on his journey there. This carefully balanced uneasy feeling mixed with philosophical self-reflection and existential and life-threatening challenges carries this movie to its third act.And you may not be rooting for Gawain until that masterfully shot third act. I was worried that the end would be Gawain walking up to the Green Knight and then cutting to black, but oh no. This has the best movie ending I've seen this year. If you want this movie to force you to re-evaluate yourself as a person, this could do that for you. If you want sword fights, gratuitous violence, and sex, go somewhere else.",The Green Knight

I will chalk it up as artistic license (yet it always left a jarring feeling to a medieval European setting, despite the main actor's acting being undeniably excellent).Above and beyond this, this film isn't supposed to be a medieval epic. It is an ""art style"" film similar to Valhalla Rising (just less violent). The problem is that it was just very boring and dull. For the life of me I was trying to find coherence and meaning to the plot, but I only found shallowness.The only and only good point of the film were some beautiful visuals/setpieces and colors (the backdrop of a castle or ruin), and the acting.Another thing that was very jarring was the anachronism in language and behavior to how medieval people would speak and act (it felt like modern young adults acting & speaking at times).

The Green Knight adapts one such text from hundreds of years ago and gives it a slick and modern 21st-century coat of paint while remaining true to the historic original poem.The film stars Dev Patel as Gawain, nephew to the king and general layabout with a good heart. Christmas celebrations are in full swing when the king asks Gawain to regale him with a story from his life. To Gawain's shame, he has none to share. However, he might soon have a tale or two to tell, when a strange green knight enters and challenges anyone brave enough to try and land a blow against him. Gawain accepts and beheads the foe, much to his and everyone else's surprise. However, the emerald figure reattaches his head, with the ease of changing a lightbulb, and gives Gawain one year, and upon next year's Christmas he must seek him out and the deadly blow shall be returned.Gawain's journey to meet his fate, sees him travel across the land and meet numerous strange friends and foes, and much like a gap year, he is inevitably left with many tall tales to tell. It's important to remember that this story is a myth and not every event of happenstance should be taken literally or at face value. Because of this, the film has more in common with a David Lynch film than it does Braveheart. The surreal and haunting experiences Gawain finds himself thrust into test his strength of character and change him from the man he was upon leaving home, even if their significance may not be instantly transparent.The Green Knight is a stunning-looking film, made on a modest budget of $15 million the film archives some staggering results with such a relatively small sum. The film is no slouch, and despite the numerous visual effects required to bring the many fantastical elements to life, none of them look subpar, and in many cases look better than contemporary counterparts. Despite being based on such ancient source material The Green Knight has its feet firmly planted in the 21st century, this is most evident in its bold and beautiful cinematography with enhances the many staggering vistas and locations featured throughout the film. The Green Knight himself is brought to life by Ralph Ineson, who looms over all others and is an eerie present. Like the name suggests he's green from head to toe, and his inhuman face is seemingly made up of branches and twigs. Whether prosthetics or computer-generated, the Green Knight looks terrific and terrifying.It's no secret that Dev Patel is a talented actor and has roes through the ranks throughout his career to become a leading man, who continues to pick interesting and surprising projects. He brings Gawain to life and injects him with all the naivety and fear that anyone would have when setting off on a journey to meet their doom. The fear inside him is relatable, but despite this looming terror he charges headfirst into challenges and uses all his wits and strength to overcome every obstacle in his path. Gawain, being a young and naive member of the royal family, it would have been easy for him to be annoying and have his character arc be a transformation from that. Instead, what we are offered is something far more interesting and realistic that isn't interested in easy answers.Despite the critical praise that has been lauded upon The Green Knight, there has been something of a mixed response when it comes to the response of the audience. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and interpretation of a film, and I respect everyone's opinion, however, if you go into the film expecting a swashbuckling fantasy-adventure movie brimming with action, you will be sorely disappointed. This is by no means a popcorn movie. It's a somewhat slow-paced, meditative experience, that will leave you with questions and abstract thoughts. I went into The Green Knight expecting this based on the trailer, and if that isn't your jam, I totally get that. The Green Knight is not a commercial film, it's a live-action myth.The Green Knight is a stunning and thought-provoking film, featuring one of Dev Patel's finest performances to date. The films slow pace and lack of action may put some views off who expected otherwise, but if you're in the mood for a slower-paced and ethereal experience, The Green Knight, and the journey to meet him is an unexpected and powerful one that you'll no doubt want to take again.",The Green Knight
371,furfur-1,"Great in many ways, one flaw.",7,3 September 2021,This movie could have been perfect. This movie is in so may ways great. The movie as a whole is mediocre.Unfortunately the movie have a huge flaw. The plot is in large parts dull and sometimes just not satisfying to watch. It feels in parts like an experimental movie.If you have the ability to differentiate the elements of a movie you will really enjoy mosts of this one.,The Green Knight
372,beanofdoom,"Atmospheric. moody, and visually appealing",8,20 August 2021,"I went into the movie with few expectations and having not read the work upon which it is based.I wouldn't say, as some have said, that I felt mislead by the trailer, rather the trailer made promises I think the film largely fulfilled.One thing to bear in mind, toward the end of sparing yourself the violently negative response others seem to have had, is that this is not going to be a Marvel movie. Unlike some, I don't believe that liking or not liking this film will be a question of intelligence, but one of openness to the experience. It moves slowly, meditatively-- be warned. I myself have found that quality frustrating in some other films, so I understand. But here I felt genuinely drawn into the world they'd created. And I think this is due to the genius job they did transporting you to the place:Of course the cinematography was amazing; the color palette from scene to scene was just indescribably well-done. The sound design though takes the prize, it was absolutely out of this world, I was blown away. One little complaint was the whole thing had this low-contrast effect going on. I assume that choice was intentional but I found it just a tad overdone. With all the other stuff going on, we didn't need that to communicate the otherworldliness of the place. It was too much and worse, the awesome job with the color palette wasn't really able to shine through as much as it could have without it.I ultimately felt a part of journey of the protagonist though. And this was exciting for me at least due to the strange, beautiful, magical and dangerous world they conceived and then so expertly communicated. And the whole experience definitely left an impression, even now days after watching it.Even understanding how one might have expected something else, it's hard for me to understand, given how much obvious work and genius went into this film, how anyone could, in good faith, give it one star.The film, in my opinion, is a solid 8.",The Green Knight
373,fuzzdandy-online,It aint Robin Hood Prince of Thieves..,10,27 September 2021,"If you take an old Arthurian folk tale and make it into a film inspired by The Wicker Man, Witchfinder General, a modern day folk horror like the VVitch and direct it in the style of somebody like Yorgos Lanthimos, you get a masterpiece called The Green Knight.It aint robin hood prince of thieves, it's a work of art. A semi-psychedelic, festive, Folk mood piece bursting with creativity. It's mesmerising to just look at. So much thought has gone into each scene that its almost like a prog record (a good one) and will probably appeal to a similar sized fan base. I watched this at home on amazon but would love to see this on the big screen to really be bewitched by the trippy coloured lighting and surrounded by its mix of pulsating sound effects and ethereal, folky soundtrack. Hats off to David Lowery & Dev Patel.",The Green Knight

It's a very rich and confident film that uses space, light, shadow and fog to its advantage that many films just can't or won't.There's a hypnotic and barely impenetrable quality to The Green Knight, much like the myth that inspired it.

While the cinematography was good, overall the acting was good. I just can't get past the middle part where Gawain gets caught and stripped of everything by a band of teens. That was enough for me to lose total interest. He was going to meet the Green Knight to fulfil his side of the bargain and everyone knows he might lose his head. But the king allows him to ride off alone with no-one to bring back his body if he in fact loses his head? This is asinine.",The Green Knight
377,ArdourFilm,An absolute feast for the eyes that leaves much to chew on.,8,9 September 2021,"Surreal and haunting, The Green Knight is an absolute feast for the eyes that leaves much to chew on.This was my first experience with writer/director David Lowery, and his storytelling and vision for this unorthodox coming-of-age Arthurian tale is expertly crafted and undeniably impressive.A lot of references to the original poem were lost on me as I've not read it, but this confusion only made way for greater intrigue and left me wanting to learn more.Understandably, this is not the case for a lot of people. Its esoteric nature, long, indulgent takes, and medieval dialogue are enough to deem this as dull or a 'slow burn'. Though, for me, the weakest aspect was the monotonous editing style. Lowery really rode into battle with that cross dissolve held high.Nevertheless, my attention was always captured, one way or another.Not only is The Green Knight a visual marvel, the sound design and soundtrack are as equally immersive, and amplify the peculiar atmosphere.Every idea, symbol, design, detail felt meaningfully placed. And even though I didn't fully understand them all, the acting helped carry a lot of that weight. Especially Dev Patel. He gave a beautifully understated performance, and he seemed very comfortable and well-suited to the role, as did most of the cast.So, while The Green Knight won't be to everyone's taste, I, for one, am happy to have a new grand-scale fantasy that feels both traditional and modern, and offers a thematic and cinematic adventure worth taking.",The Green Knight

Now on to the core of it.First thing first, Wikipedia list it as American epic medieval fantasy. Err no its not. Its Fantasy yes but PSYCHOLOGICAL epic of a movie. You see the Dev Patel is being mind F'd hard in it. The whole point was the game played by the Green Knight, a journey for our hero but not in the traditional sense, in the Momento sense or the Shutter Island sense. Its deeply psychological, i love it as much as i hate it and i know you do too.Thing is the movie could have been CONDENSED and some fairly traditional hero's journey, death and rebirth could have been thrown it in, but nup, its all weird and brain f'd all the way.Go in at your own peril gents. 5/10.",The Green Knight
386,Blightman,"surreal, visually striking test of patience",6,2 October 2021,"The Green Knight is not your typical retelling of the famous 14th century Arthurian legend.This is a whimsical yet subdued, haunting and yet plodding tale of Sir Gawain as you've never seen or read him before. Dev Patel does a fine job as the listless drunkard whose lack of purpose drives him towards the ultimately silly confrontation with the titular Green Knight. Is it honor that motivates Gawain to take up such a stilted challenge, or is it something else? We can infer, by the end, but our guesses remain only that- guesses.The Green Knight does not hold your hand and does not care if you get bored with long shots that do not evoke any particular tension but seem to only exist as eye candy. There is very little combat, but a great many shots of empty landscapes and slow pans over buttresses and under doorways. The camera will rotate and pan in a circle and while I suppose there is potential reasoning and metaphor to these cinematic choices, they linger for too long, overstay their welcome, and ultimately contribute to the boring and sometimes unintentionally droll atmosphere that pervades The Green Knight for the plurality of its runtime.The magical forces encountered in The Green Knight are interesting at times, bolted on and meaningless in others. Is any of it even real or has Gawain just been eating too many foraged mushrooms? Who is to say?The end of the film will make you think- and subsequently does make up for some of the dragging in the second act. If you're like me, you'll spend some time reflecting on the experience and asking yourself if you enjoyed what you saw. If The Green Knight was an excellent film, it would not be hard to say, and neither would it be if it were awful. Thus, it lies somewhere in the middle and slightly above indifference, if only for the visual quality and metaphors that stick with you when it's over.",The Green Knight
387,cornerofspace,A legend to be experienced.,9,8 August 2021,"The Green Knight is a refreshing and fantastically weird film in today's cinema. Despite its oddities, it is a coming-of-age hero's journey. And I have too much of a soft spot for the genre.The first thing you will notice is the camera work. It is very well done. I am clearly not an expert on this, but the cinematography is fantastic, and is a movie worth watching on the big screen. The colors are vibrant despite the overall green hue, and there is quite a bit of otherworldly elements that likely will confuse you on your first viewing. Still, I appreciate the artistic direction they decided to take in its worldbuilding. It feels delightfully mythical and otherworldly in many scenes.The next thing you will notice is the slow pacing. The Green Knight takes its time, allowing the viewer to pick up emotions and thoughts the main character feels, despite no words being said. Personally, I find fast-paced films more enjoyable, but the presentation of the film made the slow pacing worth it. It is such an odd film but I appreciate how it completely took me away from our current reality and transported us to the mythical legend of Gawain and the Green Knight.And lastly, I appreciate the themes of The Green Knight. I find a movie to be compelling when it successfully shows growth in its main character in a way that makes sense. And this is a feat considering just how weird The Green Knight was. I also think you will have a good time reading the interpretations of the community on how the movie ended. It certainly makes me want to watch it again.",The Green Knight

389,aweynand96,An Arthurian tale carved in stone,8,9 August 2021,"From the first moments to the very last, TGK felt grand and mystifying. It's honestly pretty faithful to the source material, but it manages to build on it with such an ancient and eerie atmosphere. The world Sir Gawain lives in is enigmatic and as unfamiliar to him as to us. Everything this film gives us is enveloped in this incredible, resonating score. As a fan of both fantasy and horror (and the style of many other A24 films), I was totally sold on both the premise and execution. Unfortunately it's probably not going to be the most accessible thing for a lot of people to watch because TGK is indeed strange. I hope people take a chance on it.I highly recommend reading up on the original story's synopsis to get a feel for the flow of events. Spend a couple minutes on Wikipedia, even. It may really help bring the characters into an understandable light and illuminate the purpose of a few particularly inscrutable scenes. There's some things new viewers should know to temper their expectations as well: TGK is not an action film, and it's not too comparable to other recent medieval epics like King Arthur or Robinhood (really they only share a universe and some characters).TGK is more of a journey into a terrifyingly brutal landscape where the strong and courageous seek to stamp their names in the history books. Dev Patel is phenomenal (who would have doubted him?) in this role, as a young knight of Arthur's round table eager to earn his keep. More than that, probably, to be remembered and revered by those around him. The core of his virtue is challenged and we get to watch him react in ways one would hope a real knight would. The entities, living and dead, that he encounters are fabled and imposing; I was awestruck by one specific confrontation that I don't think happened in the original romance. His interaction with a ghost in the woods is another great scene that might be my second favorite.My favorite scene, however, is the full final 10 minutes when Sir unflinching in its reflection of character and consequence. We're given glimpses of a less savory path that a less honorable knight might take, and in these crucial moments we see Sir Gawain make choices that can only define who he truly is (and aspires to be). Some people in the theater were audibly annoyed by the ending, but I was enthralled. If you were paying attention, you should know what happens after the credits roll.8/10 for gorgeous and haunting cinematography, music, and characters.",The Green Knight

It requires you to piece the movie together after viewing and even though it is extremely odd, I can't help but talk about the movie and try to figure out some plot points. I love when a movie doesn't give you everything. Some of the dialogue didn't fit and it feels like the movie is building up to something that at first glance, it doesn't feel like it delivers. It's a different movie experience where the world itself was extremely unpredictable. Right in that sweet spot of magic and fantasy but also modern day. This movie just gets better the more I think about it. At first I couldn't give it more than a 6 based on the corny dialogue and slow burn plot, but it grows on me with time, so hence the 7!

414,jtq-56435,The Triumph Of Gawain,10,30 July 2021,"A powerful and timely epic that will stand the test of time. The long journey of Sir Gawain is not only worth it but has a message that is applicable to all generations in the past and all going forward. The performances by the actors are all Oscar worthy but of course the standout is Dev Patel himself who perfectly captures the unassured yet brave mentality of a man who simply wants greatness and would travel away from comfort to achieve it. The Green Knight is a mesmerizing film that has imagery that will stay with you for a very long time, it is by no means a action film, it is a character study of one of the most obscure heroes in legend. The journey of Sir Gawain is one of beauty, loss, and triumph and is one of the best movies I personally have ever seen and is one of the greatest achievements ever put to film.",The Green Knight

I found myself a bit let down by its final moments but I've been thinking about it nonstop since the credits rolled. The imagery and symbolism here will keep your eyes glued to the screen. It is a gorgeous film that keeps your attention despite the story's slow pace. The production design is easily deserving of an Oscar nod, as is the acting from Dev Patel. Every single frame is absolutely gorgeous. Saying the story is unconventional would be an understatement, and it is definitely going to be lost on a mainstream audience (see the Rotten Tomatoes audience score for proof of this). There are many beats that hold symbolism over coherent storytelling, although it never does this to a fault. Every confusing moment has a meaning, you just might not get that meaning during your first watch. I had a hard time feeling the usual satisfaction you'd normally expect from a great film, but man is this thing interesting. If you're a casual movie goer looking for an action-packed fantasy epic, The Green Knight is everything but.

428,maddyschiappa,Changed story line to tale made for confusing themes,3,16 September 2021,"I watched the film then did a little research about the original tale which helped me make sense of things. With that in mind, I realize the Saint Winifred story took away from the overall theme of testing chivalry and watered down the emphasis on the ""exchange of winnings"". If more emphasis was placed on the ""exchange of winnings"" and the Saint Winifred scene was removed, I think the overarching themes would have been easier to recognize. However, you could also argue he was still attempting to be chivalrous, hence that success in the Saint Winnifred story, in which case, he should not have been presented to us at the beginning as so much the opposite before hand, aligning more to the true tale. And if it was intended to be a coming of age, he should have started trying to put his act together during the year prior to his debt due.Otherwise, some of the scenes were drawn out and with how confusing the story is, that made too much gap for ""wtf?"" moments. The scenery, music, and ability to recreate the time period were phenomenal thought.",The Green Knight

430,medusiac,Pretty-looking but highly pretentious hogwash,4,26 August 2021,"Oh boy. I waited for this movie ever since it was originally announced last year. I went into it blindly, not knowing the original tale of Gawain and the Green Knight. I thought, since it's a retelling of the story, the movie is going to present us with a coherent understanding of its lore, plot, and meaning.But, alas, the movie was a confusing mess. It felt like an okay watch at first and I liked some of the scenes, but when the credits rolled, I realized I can't say anything about it cause I really don't understand almost anything that transpired.So I read an interview with the director and realized that the movie is a load of pretentious hogwash.While the original tale made sense because it was about the witch showing that Arthur's knights aren't all that brave and chivalrous as they are presented to be, the movie is - wait for it - pretty much about the director's relationship with his mother. It's somehow stitched from bits of the original tale in a way that doesn't make sense, to give us a story about a dude who is sent away by his mother to go away from home and do something brave, while also being given a protective belt (like mothers do), with the idea of....um... I'm not really sure. Did she want him to die in the end as a brave man or did she want him to fail and come home in shame like in the original tale? I'm guessing both, again, like overly protective and confused mothers do (?)
Does this make it a better tale? Nein.It especially fails being a meaningful story because Gawain does the dumbest and most selfish things throughout, minus one, that just doesn't fit his character and the entire movie, so I have NO idea what's it doing there. So, his ""brave"" decision to drop the belt and lose his head after having a premonition of how terrible everything would be otherwise actually makes no sense.He's a wuss. A real piece of crap dude that you've got no reason to root for, so the ending doesn't make him ""chivalrous"" in any way. It's just silly as all hell.So, what we've got here is this - Instead of a story about how knights are actually pieces of crap, we get a ""personalized tale"" of a wuss that decides not to be a wuss thanks to a very convoluted plan put together by his witch mom.Also, if you haven't read the original, you'll have no idea about most of the stuff in the film. The dialogues are ""mysterious"" and the director leaves a whole lot to be ""deliberately ambiguous"" so that, as he says, ""the viewer can come up with his own conclusions"".In other words, he didn't give a damn about writing and directing a coherent film.So, a pretty watch that hurts your brain as soon as you start to think about it. And not in the ""Usual Suspects"" kind of way. Just the ""why the hell did I even watch two hours of this nonsense?"" way.In conclusion, Dev Patel tries his best to be a likeable wuss. Sadly, the movie makes no sense, so we don't get to like him or anyone else. The movie doesn't even let us see his head get chopped off in the end because, again, the director wanted to leave it as ""ambiguous"". HA HA.TL:DR: If you like pretentious movies that look good and make no sense, this can be a treat. Otherwise, skip.Giving it a 4 for the cinematography and being somewhat a watchable film if you don't care about meaning.

I dont know the original story, but now i want to read it, just to understand what exactly the movie was suggesting, because what i have seen tells no story, hasn't got any heart or backbone. All stories need a beginning, an intrigue, an action, a culmination and an ending. This one only has a beginning, and a weak one, and thats about it.

442,shiversad,It's hard to understand.,6,3 September 2021,"I gave this movie 6 coz i am not able to understand it completely, so there is that but most of the themes which i understood which makes to the fact that this is character redemption arc or character finding arc.You see wee see gawain most of the times being a mess up as he is in brothel all the time and drinking even tho he is king's nephew so he had very less trust in himself and when the green knight showed up out of foolishness and to prove his worth in front of everyone he takes up the challenge and even in that he shows so much doubt proves he is not ready for it but he does it and after that he passes a whole year never to change and live the same life but the visions and everything makes him go on quest to find himself and he keeps on going despite seeing that he is hating every moment of it, finally when he face the green knight he flinches again and again just to show he is still same gawain but when he have that vision how he fall off as a human being he accepts his fate finally removing that strap and with that he loses the fear of death, this courage is what is actually needed in his life which was a losers life and when he saw that flashback he actually accepted the death rather than living it, so when he was spared he knew what he has to do.You see this movie is very hard to interpret but from what i saw it's clear how it's about a man's life who got so much vices and had so much self doubt that he questioned everything he did and fear of accepting anything proved it, like that scene where girl asks him to make her lady he just did the self doubt even tho he is most comfortable with her yet there is doubt.Most courageous people don't doubt themselves and they don't have vices of lust or alcoholism but they are stern in their action and green knight is one such journey of a man.P. S most of the negative reviews here are not bad but they actually failed to grasp the point movie wanted to make and true this movie is too slow and very much filled with symbolism which can actually confuse someone, i am not even sure what i understood from the movie is actually right or not but that's my interpretation.",The Green Knight

The island of Great Britain is not as gloomy as this movie portrayed it. We saw it at a Cinema Movie Cafe. It was so dark I couldnt find the packets of mustard for my hot dog. Very depressing settings.I am not a fan of meddling with original stories but if the story is good then I am OK. This one not only took liberties but it wasnt even entertaining.Arthur was not old and feeble when this occurred. He was at the height of his power. Gawain and many of the knights were almost his contemporaries. He literally went to war at the end of the Morte D'Arthur where he died AND killed Mordred in single combat so was not even close to being an old decrepit man.There are characters that show up over and over whose relationship to the plot are NEVER revealed or even minutely developed.Last, WTH was that ending? You would have to have read the story to read in to how this had ended and if you didnt then you will have no idea. Either that or once again the writers took liberties with the story. HUGE liberties.When will Hollywood take a story and write a movie from it that follows the original which has already stood the test of time for centuries (sometimes millennia ie. Troy).Their attempt at artsy-fartsy in this movie was a major fail.It was plodding, pretentious, depressing and boring.

I say so much to clarify my love and understanding of the source material.And that being said, I do adore what has been done with this adaption. The balls on them for this reversal of morals in what was originally a moral allegory.Anyone who knows the story knows that Sir Gawain had all the qualities of valour and honesty, but he just lacked the story to tell it.In this we see the reverse. A would be knight, lacking the proper values, who fails at every test. The story, originally, is about give and take with a protagonist already able to produce such virtues. In this movie we get to see a story of Sir Gawain if he wasn't so richly and nobley endowed.The reversal is fantastic.Shot superbly, with loving nods to the source work, this movie is for the patient and the knowing.

There is no real action to speak of and the character development is minimal with exception to the lead.What I liked about it was that it was obviously allegorical, in that it is less about the green knight or Sir Gawain story than it is about the world changing from chivalric and hardy to self-serving and cowardly. It's one of those movies that is open to interpretation and allows the viewer a chance to breathe and if you let it, it will take you away from your own life.I enjoyed the camera work and props.

However, after about half of the film, these whimsical visions end up being quite misguiding for the audience when we are very much so still trying to grasp the plot. All was flowing in the journey plot, when oh, look! Giants! Giants who almost eat (?) this Fox guide and sir girwin, but decide to echolocate in unison only when the Fox guide implores them to do (idk), and then there is a sudden inversion shot of the sky (classic A24), and cut to the fox guide and Sir Girwin walking in some forest (no sight of the giants having dropped them off or really any explanation for what in the what just happened); At some point there is a castle and this hunter man, his very strange (daughter who is also a witch), and a blind folded woman...all of these people disappear after Sit Girwin kisses the Hunter dad goodbye?

Sadly, this was my worst cinema experience since Tree of life and Lady in the water. No matter what how deep and meaningful some people may find this, the truth is that it's a complete pile of garbage from end to finish. I would rather pull of my toenails before I watch this movie again. A Complete mess that drags out waaay to long and keeps you hoping and praying that something special and entertaining will happen at the end, so that the last hours haven't been a complete waste of time, but the ending was perhaps the worst part of the movie. Please don't pay to watch this, and encourage the people behind it to make more movies.",The Green Knight
465,thunder1road,GROOT RETURNS TO THE SCREEN IN HIS FIRST NON-AVENGERS ROLE,2,4 August 2021,"Back in college we studied the Arthurian legends of Gawain, Lancelot, Galahad, and the Round Table. Very little of what we studied appears in this movie. It seems to be a series of clips of people in the forest assembled in a vain attempt to portray some sort of murky spiritual journey. Half the movie is close-ups of Dev Patel's face looking very puzzled about the weird stuff that happens to him. The saving grace of the movie is Groot's first appearance in a non- Avengers movie. Apparently he has been bulking up and taking vocal training because he does speak a few new words in his portrayal of the Green Knight. There are also 2 hump scenes to break up the forest wanderings. If you are looking for a great movie about King Arthur and his knights - check out CAMELOT - much closer to the spirit of the Arthurian legends. ""Run Boy ... RUN !!!""",The Green Knight

On the positive (an odd word to use for such a downbeat movie) side, In general the movie looks and sounds beautiful and haunting. You can almost breath the mist and moss, as if you were joining Gaiwain on his odyssey. But that's the good done with..
On the downside, the story arc. Make a bad decision, realize this, learn and gain a level of redemption which in the final wash counts for nothing. Really? I am sure there must be more to this. Not being familiar with the tale really I have only what the movie offers to go on, and if there is more, it does not seek to advise the viewer. Also as mentioned by almost everyone else, this movie crawls along. I lost count of the number of scenes that either could have been fully edited out or drastically shortened. As it stands the movie version of this tale that could easily be told within 100 minutes.

474,clockworkorange13,Cant trust the critics!,6,1 August 2021,"This is the 2nd movie Ive seen by this director (the first one being Ghost Story) and it seems like he has virtually no concept of pacing or narrative flow. Green Knight had an incredible amount of potential but instead the director repeatedly slows the movie down to a snail's pace and basically stops the movie dead in its tracks. Maybe hes trying to be artsy and moody but it just feels flat and empty. Competent writer/directors tend to keep a continuous flow of compelling and engaging situations (so as to not waste the audiences time), but this director seems more interested in long stretches of nothingness.Another big complaint is the zero-budget snooze-fest of a ""climax"" at the green temple. It truly seems that the movie ran out of funds so they decided to film a quick throwaway scene out in the woods, with a gimmicky punch-line ending, even though the movie wasnt set up for that at all.Also, if you go see this, do not expect anything in the movie to be explained to any degree. Basically nothing is paid off with any kind of satisfying explanations, and a handful of the movie's events are just completely incoherent.That being said, the movie has some fantastic dialogue and very strong moments, but overall it feels undercooked and I did not feel like I was in good hands with the writer/director.",The Green Knight

There is no clear message, and the whole gimmick of ""you decide for yourself what that meant"" gets old fast.A jumble of scenes move along painfully slow, each played out by characters we have no reason to care about, and where logic seems to be missing.Please do not spend money on this and rewatch something like The Red Violin, The Piano, anything back from when movie could aim higher than commercialism and still be good.",The Green Knight

The Green Knight is a movie that keeps me up at night thinking about the prevalence of motifs. That being said, when I saw this in theater the audience were clearly unhappy at the end of the film.

Things that go unexplained and seem like major plot holes are left up to ""well, magic/witchcraft"" or ""unreliable narrator"" or ""wait a minute, he did eat magic mushrooms"".While I'm seeing a lot of polarized responses, for me it was slightly above average.",The Green Knight

But when you really think on it, this film is great.It is however not easy to get into. Much like reading a book of olde English tales like this one, it can take some effort to decipher what you are seeing on the screen before you. Treat this film like a puzzle, deciphering its code as it unravels before you. Thinking gon why Director David Lowery decided to include what he did, from shots to characters to casting choices. Pay attention to the details and you'll come out appreciating this movie immensely.It is gorgeously shot, with several long shots, trippy fantastical sequences, ornate costume design and even a bit of CGI to craft a film that looks and feels like the story it is adapting. While I haven't read the original poem of the Green Knight, doing so is absolutely not required to enjoy the film, something even the director has attested to.For a story so simply on the surface, the movies themes csn truly stick with you, especially with how effectively they are communicated to you through the films narrative. It is slow, methodical, detail oriented... and in the end, very blunt. You'll find yourself thinking on what you saw and heard and felt long after the movie is over.Discuss it with others think on it. Amd when you realize the full scope of what you saw, the movie will burst forth with new life, artistic expression and fulfillment.Dev Patel has a heavy load to bear as Sir Gawain, we spend much of the film with him alone, but as he encounters new individuals and challenges, he lives through the film brilliantly. He is a class act here and conveys youthfulness, inexperience, but also ambition, fear, confusion, and so much more over the course of the movie. The supporting cast all bear their load well also, with Alicia Vikander being a standout, and Ralph Inneson as the titular character using what little screen time he has to make the Green Knight memorable, imposing, even humorous at times.Without spoiling anything, I will say just give the film a chance and put in the effort to grasp what story is being told here and what it means. Its a fantasy film, but like any good fantasy it tells a very human story with simple but profound morals that will stay with you for some time. Join Gawain on this journey enter a time when honor was everything and courage made legends.",The Green Knight

What is a myth? What is destiny? When old king goes away, why do we greet a new king? What is ""old"" anyway?As the result, we get a completely New Gawain, who presents us with the story of dealing with questions of chivalry, loyalty, power and destiny.Huge landscape paintings are complementing questions of ""philosophy of destiny"", or as we can say ""Destination Philosophy"" - which is completely new thing embodied in the film. From The Dark City, to The Matrix and now to The Green Knight, ""Destination Philosophy"" is finally evolved, asking what moves us, what is the nature of adventurious burning fire.I want to see what David Lowery will create next, but for me he instantly became the most promising director of our time.

This certainly manages to maintain itself on the same philosophical level as A Ghost Story while broadening its horizons and expanding to a new level of awe.Dev Patel shines here as Gawain, the nephew of King Arthur whose obsession with what it means to be a legend is wholly captivating. It may help viewers to read the poem first, but even if you go in blind you should be able to put the pieces together if you're able to move along with its slow pace and settle in for the ride.Do not watch if you can't handle a slow burn.

I was really excited for this film, and there are good things about it, but beautiful cinematography, pretty music, and a stellar, eerie atmosphere cannot save the film from feeling long, boring, and pointless.Each scene feels like it's own contained story. Things will happen that will never be explained or brought up again. Interesting decisions that you think will matter later actually don't, and you're left wondering what the point of it all was, if there was one at all. I think the director just wanted to make a film that felt like a fever dream and took you along for the journey instead of making a satisfying movie with a good story and characters we care about, then he absolutely exceeded, and thus I can see why people might like this movie.

It's good, but far from a masterpiece. Many parts didn't work for me - it (intentionally) lacks a certain directness, and also doesn't have have quite the emotional impact I believe it's going for and seems convinced it has. However, I didn't find it boring outside one or two scenes. If you can 'endure' a movie paced like Taxi Driver, you should be okay with this. If everything not instantly gratifying induces an overpowering animal rage in you, stay away.What I enjoyed most about the movie were the inventive cinematography, the mostly great acting, soundtrack and some well done scenes of surrealism. Not showy, theatrical surrealism, but a sudden feeling of unreality that's difficult to pull off in any medium. On the whole, it was a bit predictable and its resolution fairly inconsequential. The latter was again, in a sense, deliberate, but wasn't realized as well as I'd hoped for. Generally, I personally would have liked it more if it were even weirder, darker, and incorporated more visceral brutality, dove deeper into that nightmarish fairy tale/fable vibe.But I agree with what other reviewers have written: It's very rare to see a well-made, unconventional and intelligent movie in the fantasy genre. I believe not only 'nowadays', as people reflexively say, but throughout the history of film. Maybe that's ignorance on my part, but I can't think of many examples. So, even though I have my issues with it, I'm very glad that it exists and am embarrassed by and for the hoards of adult toddlers here, bawling in the face of something that requires a bit (and not even that much) patience and effort on the side of viewer.",The Green Knight

522,vakhtang_mamluk,Medieval fable corrupted by Hollywood wokeness,5,2 August 2021,"This film is another example of a cultural misinterpretation and inevitable tailoring applied to fit the story into a cognitive imaginarium of woke generations, uneducated, unintelligent, amoral. I gave 5 stars for brilliant acting, camera work, atmospheric music and lightning of senes, basucaly for its stunning photography/cinematigraphy. However, filmmakers failed to create an instant classic. The film missing visually rich and enchanting esthetic of celtic imagery. Patel is one of the best actors if our time but he is too dark, too middle eastern to play the role of sir Gawaine. Mother of Gawain, allegedly wizardess Mogana is played by clearly Indian looking actress. Again, great actress but totaly unfitting and even destructive to visual atmosphere of the Arthurian tale. Even brief appearance of an African face among children watching performance of puppets is absolutely out of place. Of course majority of public unacusstomed to quality esthetics will not even flinch and probably won't feel lacking of a beauty esthetically expected by a culturally informed and sophisticated viewer. And of course film is oriented for less complex masses. Alas, what makes any film a classic is its ability to capture an intellectual audience.Separately I must mention not very cohesive aditions to the sequence of events. For instance, infusion of Winifred episode is totaly foreign to the unraveling of Gawaine. Another episode is a Walk of Giants. While both scenes are very atmospheric and the last one almost magestic, they could be added to any other film simpmy because they are not integral but insulated from the main story in any meaning.At last but most importantly. Gawain's tale original juxtaposition and interweaving of Christian and Pagan elements to produse a moral lesson is missed completely. Instead an entire story reduced to mom- son relationship. Plotting to teach an easy going son a harsh lesson of life is the only cohesive logic line surviving out of many offered y an original tale.This film displayed abimity of its makers to create an instant film classic for posterity. Yet they miserably failed. Wokeness is a bad guidance in any art but especially visual.",The Green Knight

With none of the poignancy that should go along with it.I was really looking forward to In-depth examination of the Arthurian Legend of Sir Gawain. A brave knight of the round who's only flaw perhaps was that he wasn't honest a full one hundred percent of the time. That's the legend.The movie however Gawain is a sniveling coward. Dishonest at every turn. A drunkard. Who's favorite hobby is to lose his weapon and stare into the void for hours on end.Is this what they teach is movie making now? Don't examine a legend... urinate all over it, that makes it 2021-style, because every legend can be retold 2021-style with vintage style clothes.Using that idea as a model. I have a movie for Lowry. It's based on Little Red Riding Hood. Only the girl doesn't have a basket full of goodies for grandma. She has S&M and bondage toys in her basket. She dreams of running her own human trafficking ring. But she just doesn't have the courage. One day she meets a wolf. Who's really a Russian pizza delivery guy who moonlights as an actual human trafficker. Oh he's also a rapist so the basket full of goodies is very useful.As true camera pans out for the credits. You see red riding hood. She tells her grandmother played by a purple Eskimo that she was violated. But also that her breasts are full of pollution. Then she explodes. We pan back to see a three hour long shot of an igloo. The Russian guy delivers a pizza.Gritty and 2021 enough for you? Cuz let me tell you mayonnaise with green girdle preceding 90 minutes of forest shots was such a waste of film, time, and life. I hope everyone involved with this film take a long break and really re-examine where their careers have gone. It is a sign Lowry should never direct again and no one should ever listen to Ebert ever again.

524,mmalmberg234,Beautiful and perfect representation of chivalric romances,10,28 August 2021,I don't understand the negative reviews at all. I guess if your definition of a great film is the first avengers movie then yeah this is probably not for you. It reminded me almost perfectly of old arthurian legends as compiled in Bullfinch's Mythology. It keeps the spirit of those stories but our protagonist is human and experiences fear and doubt. Those stories are very boring due to how perfect the heroes are and (like the lady in the house) it improves them where necessary. Highly entertained and I loved the beauty of the film. This is the first movie I have ever watched the entire credits so I could see the names to look at their other work. Its true film and true art.

534,anishselar,"haunting, mystical, epic look at one's journey to become something more than he thought himself to be, and it was a thrilling watch.",9,1 August 2021,"David Lowery's The Green Knight is a highly meditative, slow-burn coming-of-age epic about self discovery and courage. So thought provoking and haunting, I couldn't help but feel entranced through my watch. It was a very sensual experience with the score playing a major role and pulling me through the film for long periods where there was no dialogue. A cross between Excalibur and Blade Runner 2049 or The Seventh Seal is what this really felt like. The ambiguity Lowery achieved is so great, its just enough since I still felt so satisfied when it ended.Lowery said the script was only around 80 pages and that was apparent. Most of the film is carried by Dev Patel's engrossing performance, whose practically in every frame, and by Daniel Hart's score which was simultaneously operatic and haunting. The score is the most memorable of the year so far and acts as a major character throughout the film. There were sequences when the visuals along with the score gave me such a high I found myself catching my breath. The cinematography from Andrew Droz Palermo was outstanding and the scope was so epic. Hopefully it gets the attention it deserves in the award season.Dev Patel as the mostly naive Gawain was just great, its his best performance besides 2016's Lion. There are many close-ups used to focus on the emotion and the way he was able to convey so much with just his eyes was amazing. Sarita Choudhury as Morgan Le Fay, Gawain's mother and sister to Sean Harris' King Arthur, had very few lines but was an everlasting presence throughout the film as she is in the poem its based on. She's involved in much more than meets the eye, but I won't get into it here to keep it spoiler-free. Sean Harris' King Arthur was a very warm and mentor-like presence for Gawain, helping him realize that the world is much more vulgar and dangerous than Gawain thinks it to be. Alicia Vikander was great in a brief dual role, as Gawain's lower-class girlfriend Essel and as The Lady, who were nice touchstone's for Gawain along his journey. Joel Edgerton as Lord Bertilak had a brief but impactful appearance, but played off Patel's somber Gawain really well with a more happy-go-lucky vibe. The Green Knight, played by Ralph Ineson, sets Gawain's quest in motion by presenting him with the gambit. Ineson's husky voice and commanding presence made the Green Knight great fun to watch, with every move of his being felt through the sound design on the speakers in the theater. The VFX work by Weta was really seamless and especially on the Green Knight himself.The character of the Green Knight is a great metaphor for multiple people in Gawain's life, and the way Lowery handles this was very clever. Its easy to miss in a shot towards the end if you're not paying attention. This medieval fantasy is not action-packed, its just a somber, meditative movie so don't expect huge battles. It was a haunting, mystical, epic look at one's journey to become something more than he thought himself to be, and it was a thrilling watch.",The Green Knight

539,aherdofbeautifulwildponies,"Silent Knight, Holy Knight",7,14 October 2021,"The works that come to mind when thinking about The Green Knight (2021) are The Seventh Seal (1957), the great medieval fantasy by Ingmar Bergman; Tale of Tales (2015), Matteo Garrone's scenic adaptation of a seventeenth-century collection of fairy-tales; and Game of Thrones (2011-2019), the epic television series whose origins were inspired by the Wars of the Roses. This comparison helps to establish how much historical credibility one should expect from The Green Knight: not too much.As with Bergman's film, The Green Knight is best enjoyed when considered a piece of modern theatre set against a medieval-inspired background. The themes of the narrative are, after all, eternal: destiny and self-determination, justice, civilization vs. Nature, the value and character of truth.On New Year's Eve, the Green Knight arrives at the royal court and challenges those present to a game: he who lands a blow on the stranger will win the Green Knight's axe, but, in a year's time, must travel to the Green Chapel and receive a blow in return. Young Gawain, the king's nephew, accepts. That is the premise of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, a Middle English chivalric romance dating from ca. 14th century. David Lowery's 2021 picture The Green Knight introduces a handful of key differences, moving the events to Christmas Day and making enchantress Morgan le Fey Gawain's mother, who summons the Green Knight herself. Her motives remain unclear, as do many of the film's narrative elements.The production relies on our familiarity with the legend (for example, neither King Arthur nor Merlin nor Excalibur are named) and Christian iconography (the crowns worn by King Arthur and Queen Guinevere incorporate halos; Gawain's shield has the image of Virgin with Child; Saint Winnifred appears as a minor character), suggesting that symbols are there to be recognised and read; yet, also introduces seemingly random fantastical details, the meanings of which are a mystery.Who is the Green Knight, and should we care that Winifred claimed he is someone Gawain knows? Are Essel and the Lady the same person, given that at least one of them is a sorceress, both are played by Alicia Vikander, and Gawain himself seems confused by their likeness? Why are there giants, eerily similar to those from Attack on Titan (2013-), marching away into the mist, and how come they converse by howling? Why does the fox follow Gawain? (By the way, I love the fox. It is the most beautiful CGI creation to grace the big screen in recent times.) Why do the forest robbers wear animal ears? Can they turn? Is the Lady the fox, given that she is one of the only two characters to appear in fur and matches the beast both in colour and cunning? (The fox, eventually, speaks in a male voice, but so does Queen Guinevere.) Did I, or did I not, see Gawain pass a whale carcass? The brief moment when he hallucinates after eating mushrooms, are we to treat that as a mark of hunger or of an unreliable narrator? So on and so forth.There are two circumstances which make this abundance of questions troublesome. One, Gawain acts as the everyman, reacting to the events with the confusion felt by the audience. He shares our uncertainty, which makes it more real, establishing the fantastical elements as something foreign even to a person of the same world.Two, the intended and unintended symbolism of the film appear to be at odds. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Lowery explained that the sickly appearance of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere stands for the doomed, conservative Christianity of Arthur's court, given in opposition to 'the freewheeling paganism of the Green Knight and Morgan le Fay'. Dying civilization vs. The vitality of nature. The distinct issue with this parallel is in the figure of Gawain, whose journey involves accepting his duty as well as his own death, all the while carrying the giant axe destined to cut off his head. In Gawain, Lowery successfully creates a foil for Jesus - see the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane and carrying the cross. So much for restricting Christianity to the rooms of the ancient monarchs.There are scenes of wonderful quality in The Green Knight, with Barry Keoghan's part and the film's very finale especially noteworthy. The Irish landscapes are magnificent and the decisions of costume designer Malgosia Turzanska are always, at least, interesting. Cinematography by Andrew Droz Palermo has ensured the movie is exceptionally beautiful. It is a shame that the script, chaotic in its complexity, does not live up to the visuals.",The Green Knight

Honestly it showed way too much of the movie, I regret seeing it after watching the whole film as it spoiled quite a few cool things I'd eventually see.I've seen this happen with a few movies. Drive comes to mind, where people didn't pay any attention to the feel or mood of trailers, expecting Fast and Furious 14 but getting an actually fantastic movie instead... then walking out of the theatre like it's the movie's fault for being way better than you wanted it to be. If a trailer skillfully/accurately shows what a movie is about, it's on the viewer to judge accordingly. Very confusing.This is my cynicism in film goers showing through, to each their own, but their negative reviews stating this movie is a 1 are completely false and is why I had to write my own review.This movie won't be for everyone.

556,Albino_Hyena,A slow-burning adaptation that breathes new life into the ancients,9,2 August 2021,"The Green Knight combines the best elements of both of David Lowery's two other stunning films: it immerses you into the setting like Ain't Them Bodies Saints did, and leaves you with a haunting feeling similar to that of A Ghost Story.This film brings the world of Arthurian-era England to life like never before. Unlike Guy Ritchie's failed attempt ""King Arthur: Legend of the Sword"", The Green Knight does not turn this thousand-year-old epic poem into a modern action movie with the knights acting as superheroes. The story takes its time, and violence is kept to a minimum. A rich array of characters, including witches, kings, knights and tricksters, are introduced with little to no exposition, and it is mostly up to the viewer to figure out their role in the events on screen. That does not equate to the film being boring, though; it is a visual feast that you the audience are witness to, and it will require your imagination.The Green Knight also has one of the most distinct aesthetics since Blade Runner 2049, and period-fitting music that occasionally gives the impression that the story is being sung to us by an enthusiastic bard. Being unfamiliar with the details of the epic poem it's based on will give you a great deal of anticipation, as the virtues being sought and explored by this protagonist aren't ones often focused on in modern fiction.It doesn't quite hit the perfect groove, however. Despite the amazing cinematography and color pallet, there are a few scenes in the second act that start to feel a bit repetitive and probably could have been trimmed. I applaud this film for taking this concise plot and making it enthralling, but when the scenes in between major plot points fail to be concise, the effect may wear off on the viewer.Overall, this is an excellent film and the best of 2021 so far. It does an incredible job memorializing the pagan legends of ancient Britain and mixing them with the ideals of chivalry romanticized by the Christian kings and their knights. The non-literal sequences are visually interesting and begging for your interpretation, and by the end you might find yourself pondering the same questions as the protagonist.",The Green Knight

We also so many instances we see him do things not because it's his choice but because he's pushed. The final scene is all about him choosing to what HE wants to do. What HE believes is right.

564,brucejsantos-39894,Waste of Funding,3,17 October 2021,"This movie is not enjoyable - period. The bi-chromatic 'cinematography' was idiotic, over-emphasized, and annoyed the overall experience. Scenes were not - I repeat NOT - a 'visual beauty' (such reviews are hogwash), and it was clearly evident that there minimal effort to scout locations ('old battlefield' being a perfect example). Key actors were good; but direction given to all remaining actors must have been 'act like you're in a trance' or 'do nothing' as that about sums up their rolls. The ""Artistic"" label is far-fetched, unless you also define the animated LOTR movie as being the same (similar vibe, yet even the direction of that movie is better).

We're told he desires The Lady, yet he never looks at her with lust or desire, in turn making The Lady a lesser character. The one with Essel never built up to be what we're later shown, again, hurting the conflict of Essel. The only trait which doesn't break is him being a dumb person.If the creators took any risks, made any character development, this could have been a good movie. It doesn't, the main character is plain and dumb, a goody two-shoes when desired but introduced as a bit of a rebel, there's no arc for him to go from one to the other.The casting is not good, actors could exchange roles and it would be a better movie.The structure is almost like an anthology, there's hardly a thread between scenes, and this might be the core issue with the movie.",The Green Knight

570,drniggle,The Green Knight: A story about how mom's can just screw up,7,20 August 2021,"This is an elegant and beautifully executed story about how a young man comes to understand that the best thing he can do for the world is die. This is entirely set into motion by his mother. Let's ignore the part where the Green Knight very clearly states that whatever harm comes to him will be returned one year from when it happens. Movie's gotta move. Let's talk about mom.Mom knows her son is a bit of an alcoholic. Her solution to this is to tell him to go to a party where she will be sending a magically generated champion to test... someone, the king? The realm? Her son, specifically? The ends to her means are never clearly spelled out, however once her son has been bound to this ""Christmas Game"", she gives him a magic sash and lets him go; no one is the wiser of her schemes. The ends to her means are only alluded to: her son was a bad egg and it could have been her story to come to terms with that. We never even saw her real reaction to taking part in his death.1. The sash is a lie.Points to the movie for showing semen on camera; that was reaction provoking for a few reasons, none of them important. It's also an excellent metaphor for a safety blanket, and the final symbol for Dev's realization that he should get dead. It's also a great symbol of his delusion and belief that other people are able to protect him. It's also an excellent example of why he's an idiot. It also may be a reason why he thinks his mother wants to believe in him.2. You're a celebrity and I wanna plow you.Don't shoe-in your Harvey Weinstein references; other movies have made excellent narratives on that subject and I don't understand why this one even has a reference to it. Unhand me and let us go our ways.3. Killing people is small brain.I think we've all felt like the best way for the-collective-us to proceed is if certain people die. That's decisive and final. Certain now-ruined scifi TV shows explored different schools of thought, including but not limited to, education by example, forgiveness, the Inner Light, or exploration of preconceived values. These are by no means the standards by which art should be judged, and also they're super boring omg where are the fighting games with action missiles. This movie takes the stance that, no matter who you are, the most important thing you can do is realize how you effect others, and if you effect them negatively, kill yourself because it's noble.And for the love of god, if you're a mother, don't let your child find out that you put them in that position because then they'll have something to live for: revenge.4. We didn't see him die.If you think this is open ended, then you're the sort who will still be clutching your safety blanket when you hear the words ""Well done, my brave Knight. Now off with your head.""5. The moral of the story:
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.And also your parents will be responsible for your death if you can't figure out that they're secret jerks.",The Green Knight
571,BlueBird84,"Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing (or almost nothing)",4,6 August 2021,"A24 films are pretty hit or miss for me. Some of them indulge too much in aesthetics and pretty shots and dramatic pauses and neglect the art of telling a compelling story. The Green Knight, unfortunately, falls into the latter category. The people saying that detractors should stick to Transformers seem to be of the camp that thinks the only mission of film is to look good.Pros:
As a period piece, knocks it out of the parkFantastic actingPretty shots and music as is standard for A24Cons:
Another installment in the ever-growing series of films that ask, ""how can we brownwash European legends?"" No explanation is given for why Indian Gawain and his mother are not only present in 14th century Europe, but sitting at the king's side.Long stretches of time are spent watching people sleep, walk, or gape while loud music roars in the background. TV shows can afford to indulge in stuff like this, movies cannot. You only have < 3 hours, every moment should count.Multiple instances of character motivations being unclear muddies the waters and makes the plot difficult to interpret.The clear structure and moral lessons that are inherent to Middle English legends just don't mesh at all with A24's ambiguous writing. In a structured moral tale, you can't be wondering if large chunks of the movie even happened or not, or what you were supposed to think about x or y, or why someone did this or that.A24 should have just made their own movie about a knight struggling with being compared to more experienced war legends, holding flawed people to heroic standards, the value of honor, and so on. These themes are all interesting, but they do not work when stretched and bent and crammed to fit into the Arthurian legend framework.",The Green Knight

Who knew.You will encounter alot of people jerking themselves off about the subtle symbolisms, unexplained complexities that you need a napkin to really workout and character development im sure.But at the end of the day.

575,XE_Kilroy,Technically brilliant but too arty and dull.,3,6 November 2021,"The Green Knight is a very good reminder of why I generally don't like the medieval fantasy genre. There are some great ones like The Princess Bride, Harry Potter, etc, where they are grounded in a tangibility. But films that are so heavy in art, long stretches of bizarre scenes, dream sequences, and such, are always -- for me -- hard to sit thru. I appreciate the endeavor and craftsmanship, but it's just not my taste most of the time. Even films like 2001: A Space Odyssey aren't easy. I guess being sci-fi we give them a little more leeway than the medieval period with mythical beings, sorcery, and ye olde talke.I didn't enjoy it, was bored. I ""get it"" but again, it's just not my thing. It's a meaningful story, but the overly arty approach detracts, takes center-stage over the story itself. Others who love this genre will enjoy it tho.The film's strength is the cinematography, of course. Lighting, colors, painted backdrops, great camera movements and zooms, shot compositions, story-boarding, etc. The full array on display....indoor scenes lit up and elegant to dark and constricting, to outdoor scenes vivid and wide to haunting and peaceful bubbles. It's all there. And probably a bunch of shots paying homage to other films only a connoisseur would know what they were.I've never read any of the ye olde fables that this movie is derived from. But from what I can gather.......---SPOILERS AHEAD---It's a story about a privileged upper-class man called Gawain, who is no longer 18 years of age but still living at home, doing nothing with his life, no motivation or ambition, apathetic, feels his future holds nothing great. All he does is booze up and fool around with a peasant whore much to his mother's and the King's dismay.His mother is the sister of the King. His mother is also a sorceress it seems, and casts a spell to try and motivate her boy to get out and do something with his life, to find something, become a man, at least die trying (in such harsh eras).So a quest begins due to her sorcery. I won't delve into the specifics, but essentially it's a challenge to a game of life and death, a rite of passage. To embark on an odyssey thru many trials and tribulations in hopes that he returns a man to become a worthy King, as the current one is dying of old age.Much of what Gawain experiences is part-visions, part-reality. Often ones highlighting his lack of courage, honor, and dignity still in his bones. There are some key moments in the movie here, but to conclude, Gawain basically chickens out of his tests, returns home a fraud, and his Kingdom thus falls into ruin, his queen and his mother abandon him, etc. But it's all a vision of truth, and so in the end he does accept the test, his fate, of beheading, and avoiding all the foretold years of misery and ruin from the vision.If it was more character-driven and less arty, the humanity in the story would've come out far better, been affecting. Even the sense of adventure lacked gravity and suspense. All visual dressing, bombardment, and lacking emotive grit.",The Green Knight

But it really lacks a coherent plot line, it is like someone just threw together a bunch of scenes without any real plan.

603,valeriiegedeshevykh,An Interrupted Fairy-Tale,5,10 August 2021,"The Green Knight, directed by David Lowery, is one of the most special films of this year. A24, which we know for making films that are far from the classical, has again produced an interesting film. David Lowery managed to grab my attention with The Old Man & the Gun and The Ghost Story. On the other hand, I can't praise his last movie as much as the other two. The director, who tells the story of a fantastic journey, unfortunately failed to take me into his fairy-tale world. And the problem is only himself. However, I really wanted to be a part of this poem. Although even I don't like poetry.Let's touch on the subject briefly... Gawain is the heir of the king. He is not ready to be a knight, waiting for his time. But the knighthood comes to his door without waiting for him. The Green Knight, who comes to the castle on Christmas day, invites a brave person to meet him for the Christmas Game. Among all the knights, only Gawain, who doesn't even have a sword, challenges the Green Knight. After defeating the Green Knight, Gawain must find the Green Knight on Christmas Day, exactly one year later, deep in the north, in the green chapel. The road is long and dangerous. Gawain must overcome all of this, should keep his promise and find the Green Knight.A poetry adaptation, The Green Knight prefers a fairy-tale-like narrative throughout the film, and it makes it very clear in every second that it is a literary work. This was also the main reason for my interest in the film: A knight embarks on an epic journey and tries to reach his goal. On the other hand, the movie could not give me the fairy-tale adventure that I dreamed of. The only reason for this is that the fiction reveals itself too much. Unfortunately, some parts of the movie break the integrity and damage the mystical and fairy-tale universe of the movie. The scene where the camera rotates 360 and we travel forward in time, or the scene where Essel paints or photographs Gawain. Looks too cool yes but brokes the reality line in the story.Technically speaking, the film is quite strong. But if we look at the film in the framework of A24, it is just a different copy that has all the features of otheir ther thrillers. The goat, the slow-moving camera, the red spot, the tension created by the Chant music... Probably A24 makes directors sign an agreement that if you are going to make a thriller, these things must be part of it. So much so that even the actors in the movie are have taken part in A24 projects before. If the movie belonged to another company, I would praise it for its excellent cinematography. Again, I still giving the credit, it has an impressive visuality. However, because I watched all of the A24 movies, I couldn't be fascinated by the visuals.Gawain says he's not ready to be a knight, but the knighthood is on his doorstep. Throughout the film, many issues that he is lacks of confronts as an obstacle in his adventure, and he manages to overcome all of them, albeit with difficulty. The adventure part of the movie is interesting. As a result, it would have been a great movie if the adventure hadn't been interrupted by unnecessary scenes. The flashforward sequence of the movie in the finale was so marvelous that I would probably give 10 out of 10 if it had been brought up to that point with an uninterrupted integrity. However, I personally left the cinema unsatisfied, cuz director focused on the visual feast rather than the story integrity.To sum it up... While The Green Knight might be an epic journey, unfortunately, it's nothing more than an average movie due to too much involvement in the story in fiction. As someone who has watched the films of A24, it is annoying that the film has exactly the same features as the other films, but when we look outside the frame, there is a magnificent cinematography. If this magnificent cinematography had progressed in an integrated way with the story, if the cinematography had not tried to get ahead of the story, I could have praised our fantastic journey with fantastic interpretations.",The Green Knight
604,Nico-Scaeva,"""It's all so arty, there's no art left in it.""",1,5 August 2021,"Wow. What an absolute waste of two hours. This movie is the film equivalent to a Jackson Pollack painting: a meaningless, aimless, worthless collection of absurd splatters which millions of people pretend to find profound. It is the most A24 movie I've ever seen.Setting aside the entire armory full of guns Chekhov will never get back, the film has absolutely no moral, emotional, spiritual, or even educational purpose whatsoever. It is not moving. It is not entertaining. It is not coherent. It's climax is a sad, boring dream, it's hero is not a hero, it's villain is not even a villain, but rather a pre-programmed robot with no explanation or motive for his villainy.This movie is like a bad mushroom trip, during which you feel like you're going to throw up and crap yourself, and then at the end, you do.This movie was made with one purpose in mind: to be a hideous modern art piece on the proverbial bedroom wall of every pretentious drone who fancies himself a cinephile and sophisticate, which he can marvel at and pretend to be profound, and roll his eyes at you as you express your confusion as to what he sees in it.Anyone in here pretending this movie has any value at all is one of these fake, pretentious, pretenders who want to ""get it"", but want even more for you to think they ""get it"".Absolute garbage. The one star I'm forced to give this acid-induced finger painting of a film is earned by Alicia Vikander and a but of interesting cinematography.Go through and read some of the 10 star reviews and you'll see the exact type of pretentious, sesquipedalian sophism I'm talking about.

605,wcd-19926,Cultural Appropriation?,1,18 October 2021,"Why is it cultural appropriation only goes in one direction? I know that the modern consensus was summed up by the writer Steven Moffat in an interview where he stated ""We've kind of got to tell a lie. We'll go back into history and there will be black people where, historically, there wouldn't have been, and we won't dwell on that. We'll say, 'To hell with it, this is the imaginary, better version of the world. By believing in it, we'll summon it forth'."" What about the majority of people who don't subscribe to this view because they want figures set in a historical setting, even if it's a work of fiction, to be factually correct. Otherwise create your own work set in a completely fictional world. One could argue that if Moffat is correct wouldn't it have been OK to do a remake of Kurosawa's the Seven Samurai and set it in feudal Japan but insert the cast of Sturges film the Magnificent Seven? I think not. So why is it OK to cast Dev Patel and others in an Arthurian legend set somewhere in the late 5th and early 6th centuries of the history of Britain?",The Green Knight
606,sifter42,"Beautiful art piece, terrible movie.",2,14 August 2021,"I may be jumping the gun here, but I think it is in the running for my least favorite movie of 2021. Solid D-. The only saving throw of this movie was that they did a pretty good job of following the poem is was based on. I mean that poem is very very old, and they didn't even try to modernize any of it to make it more accessible to the general audience. It felt like they put parts of the poem into the movie just to say they did it. Some of those made sense only if you're really reaching and trying to assign meaning to what they did.If you sat down and wrote out the plot points from beginning to end, it makes sense and is actually pretty clever. The problem is that those plot points equal about 20 minutes of this 130 minute movie. The rest of the movie is painfully slow panoramas, artistic views, and some parts that frankly were just a waste of time. I struggled at points to simply stay awake.Then came all the ""WTH"" moments that are weirdly stuck in there. I actually did a double-take when I saw it was written by David Lowery. For a second I could have sworn it said David Lynch. I'm sure there are some people out there who liked Lynch's works, but I couldn't stand them. I really dislike movies that are intentionally left vague and randomly choose to not make any sense. Green Knight definitely felt like a step in that direction.Some entire sections that go on for 10-15 minutes could have been entirely cut, and the movie would have been better off. Honestly I think they put them in the movie just so later on they could be referenced and the audience would find them clever. Nope. Not me. I'm kind of surprised it got so many good reviews. There is probably a niche group of people that loved it. However, the average viewer would most likely dislike it. Personally I feel like they totally blew their chance of making a really good movie. What you see in the trailer is not even close to a good representation of the film.***SPOILERS BELOW***Ok, so for those of you who have seen it... I think it's arguable that this movie actually ended about 30-40 mins in. When the robbers tie him up in the forest, the camera spins around and you briefly see that Gawain died. Nothing left but bones. Arguably he died there and the rest of the movie is just made up stories about what could have happened. My friend argued that that the corpse was his ""bad dream"" and he woke up knowing that he had to try harder to survive. Ok...There were many parts of this movie that either made my scratch my head, or just roll my eyes. Here are my top 5:WTH moment #1: Other than to follow the poem, why is Gawain's first instinct to decapitate the Green Knight? The Knight literally said that Gawain could give him a small scratch and be considered victorious. They even explain that the Green Knight will do the same to Gawain one year later. Who immediately thinks they should go extreme and chop his head off? I see nothing honorable or legend worthy of Gawain decapitating an unarmed opponent; who kneels and practically encourages Gawain to do it. I understand that it was the first of many nods to Gawain's lack of honor. I also understand they were just following the poem. It still is a pretty over-the-top event.WTH moment #2: Everything with the scenes of St. Winifred. That was so out of left field and IMO brought nothing to the story. Then they bring another similar looking actress as the young queen later in the movie. Just to make people wonder if it's the same person? Was that like using the same actress for Essel and The Lady? Mulholland Drive already did this. I didn't like that trick when Lynch tried it either.WTH moment #3: The Giants walking around. Again, why? Other than a result of eating bad mushrooms and to have a cool moment for the trailer - what purpose did it serve?WTH moment #4: The scene where Gawain gets the second sash... It was over sexualized with the cringeworthy ""fluids"" that soaked the sash. I get that it's yet another nod to Gawain's weakness and lack of honor, but there were many ways they could have done that better.WTH moment #5: Every scene with the blind mother character at The Lord's keep. I got the connection to Gawain's mother with the wraps over her eyes, and then later when she touches Gawain's face. Other than to make it creepy, why was that character even there? I've heard it argued that Gawain's mother was just keeping an eye on him. She was just making sure that Gawain didn't get seduced by The Lady, so the mother always watches them together. Creepy. Clearly her presence there did not change the outcome. I mean honestly, if you completely took that character out of the Lord's castle; what would you lose?I'm sure people can think up personal explanations and argue interpretations. My opinion is that if the writer didn't make it clear in the movie, they didn't do their job correctly. There were so many loose ends and tangents in this movie. So many that I lost interest in the movie very early on. The rest of it was just me hoping it got better. It did not. Literally the only part I liked was after Gawain removed the sash. The second time. Probably the worst part is that it felt like they were making this movie for a niche crowd of intellectuals. Just so they could look down on the average viewer and say, ""Hah, you didn't understand the brilliance of this film? You simpleton....""",The Green Knight

The pointless plot led to ghosts who offered up useless hints, a random fox, giants???, something that looked like Hogwarts in the middle of nowhere, random writing on the screen that you can't read and more ""whimsical"" scenes. The climax of the movie seems to be the beginning where we meet the green knight, and it's just downhill from there. In the opening scenes, I wondered if I made a mistake going to see it, and I sure did. The main character is dumber than a box of rocks and blatantly ignores the key part of the riddle, ultimately ending in... who knows?! This was supposed to be a story about a man finding himself (that's what google says) but between the awful script, bipolar plot that leads to nowhere, and music that makes you want to projectile vomit, this movie lands #1 on my list of worst movies ever.",The Green Knight

Not that knowing that Sean Harris was King Arthur etc would've made The Green Knight any more enjoyable.

I have always liked movies that feel original and different than anything I have seen before and I don't believe I have seen anything quite like this before.

Not since ""The Lobster"" have I hated myself so much for allowing nothing more than the Sunken Cost Fallacy to keep me watching till the end when in retrospect my life would be categorically better if I had just walked out right when I started to realize I was not going to enjoy this movie...which was about 10 minutes in.

631,zeldery,Want to do more than what I can deliever,4,7 September 2021,"The story follows a soon-to-be-great knight in his story to transform from a mediocre noble into a knight with a great story to-be-told-forever. And as expected, the story mentioned big characters and any knights, or any men should have: fear of God, purity, justice, and so on.Given that topic, I don't think any films will be ranked 7 or 8, because either you nailed it for a 9 or 10, or you failed and become a mediocre movie. Unfortunately, this is the latter case. The film seems to lose its pace from the very beginning, and it's hard to follow, track director's idea, or even tell about the purpose of the film. The fantasy factor (based on a poem's world) is boring, and leave nothing in your mind after you take one or two bites of the popcorn.I think the acting is on the bright side of this review, where the actors try their best to deliver the message.

This probably deserves more of a 6 rather than a 7.Having said that, this movie has the same problems that other A24 movies have. It starts with awesome introduction, then drags to a really reaaaally slow pace, script is meh, awful pacing and editing overall, impressive production design, great casting, edgy cinematography, etc...First act is awful, i mean really awful. Almost no character development. Dialogues and actions are souless and poorly executed. No cinematic language establishment whatsoever. Like they put in a blender a bunch of edgy underexposed shots and said ""ladies and gentlemen... art!"".No no sir, maybe most people don't understand by detail the texture of what cinema is made of, but by reading other reviews they definitely can tell when something is horribly wrong. I understand why so many people say they walked out, really.But after 30 mins, the movie gets a better pacing, better shots, better editing, better character introduction, better acting, but most important, better rhythm. Its not great, but way waaaaaay better.And the production design. OMG, really impressive.Also, though I wouldn't call its cinematography as great, there are some really beautiful shots too. Cinematography is more than some edgy or gorgeous shots people, its about storytelling and how every shot dialogues between each other. I know this is not the place to talk a out that, but I really wish more young cinematographers and editors took this more seriously instead of trying to be edgy or trendy.And that use typography.... gross.But again, production design is too good to be true!!

My son is a sound engineer and he griped about the simple adjustments needed to make the whispered dialogue *and* the music equally audible. But I digress.I'm very familiar with this story. Overall, I liked this take on the legend. Some of the symbolism was delivered with a sledgehammer, but hey, we're in allegory territory here. The good old monster movie trope of ""Never trust the friendly space aliens"" was well played. Sarita Choudhury and Alicia Vikander were fantastic and Dev Patel was the glue holding the movie together. His character was likeable from the first scene and I immediately rooted for him to succeed.The cinematography was lush, brilliant, creepy, evocative--especially the use of dark/light and colors. 10 stars for it. Costumes were great. The music was good.Why only 6 stars then? Because it felt like an extended director's cut. It needed a firm editor and at least 20 minutes deleted. My son and I both lost interest at about the 40 minute mark. We'd been looking forward to this for weeks, but we finished it only because we paid for it. The snippets of humor fell flat, every one of them. I found myself reciting lines in my head from MP and the Holy Grail in spots. The minute the fox appeared I wished someone had involved Pixar.Without spoilers, I will say that I haven't been this relieved at a final scene in years.So: Watch it for Dev Patel. He's on my short list of ""I'll watch a movie if he's in it."" Watch it for the cinematography. Watch it to compare where it keeps to the source material and where it adds its own take.

What this means for the viewer is that if you are familiar with the source material you will get a great movie to go along with it and if you aren't you will find yourself admiring the visuals but ultimately being overwhelmed by the absurd and wacky story elements that require a lot of thinking to interpret. I mean let's be honest, we're talking about a film adaptation of a 14th century poem!That being said, I found the movie quite intriguing and enjoyed the car ride discussion home over what it was trying to say/ what scenes meant what but the film is ultimately a ""thinker "" and may be appreciated more by those who admire filmography or are into movies for the artistic value.

The movie consists of a wide variety of absolutely pointless random scenes that don't really have anything to with anything and do not contribute anything to the movie. There are also random discussions with random people on few occasions, but as you can probably guess, those generally don't make any more sense. If you want to watch scenes that drag on for no reason and that do not lead to anything except wasting the viewers time than this is definitely a movie to watch.

674,mikecoopey,A very mixed bag of pain and pleasure.,5,30 August 2021,"There is definitely a desire to want to praise this movie yet equally every reason to rail with abject frustration. Easily forgiven on both accounts.All said and done, I sit on the fence on this one. For the most part, I absorbed every scene with heightened interest and curiosity, and lapped up the visuals and mystery. At no point did I not at least enjoy the scenes that unfolded. I was especially captivated by the scenes with the Green Knight himself. They were beautifully done. The performances and characters were all interesting and intriguing, and well-played, with a surprise nod to Keoghan who really captures some fun mischievous energy here. Saying that, Vikander and Harris felt totally out of place. Vikander, especially, looked completely confused by it all. The rest; sound, visuals, pace, effects, all worked just fine for me. There were moments where these elements actually challenged you a little bit, maybe too much. That much maligned slow pacing or the aggressive, expressive soundtrack could easily jar with a viewer resisting the idea of being challenged by the artistic process. I myself thought 'bit weird, that bit' more than a couple of times.None of any of that, for me, is the flaw, here. I can't say any of what I've mentioned was perfect, by any means, but I had no problem being challenged in any way by the artistic style or direction. I typically enjoy and appreciate those stylist directions.Where it all falls apart is the cohesiveness and meaning. It's shockingly vague, ambiguous, puzzling and either assumes far too much on the viewer's own effort or just completely missed its point entirely. Some might argue, it's an artistic expression to be unravelled as we, the viewer, wish to interpret, picking up subtle clues or patterns as to what each vignette or unannounced interaction symbolises. Then again, you could say, the filmmakers ballsed it up. I appreciate a level of effort on my part: to follow hints or suggestions, and join the dots myself. But there was very little generosity on behalf of the filmmakers to ensure that trip and that challenge was gratifying, or even the slightest bit pleasant or collaborative. It was just... too... vague, in all it's splendour, to actually connect with emotionally or narratively. Ignorantly vague, I'd suggest. A two-hour long... who?? What?? How?? To the point where each vignette took you further from any tangible answer, not towards. There was a moment towards the end where I pretty much quit. I stuck around to the credits, but whatever interest and support I had for willing this film to live up to any sort of narrative success died shortly before the final act, like losing the will to live as the father-of-the-bride's speech extends beyond the two hour mark at your best friend's wedding. I mean, we're here, we're interested, but give us a reason to bloody care. Know your audience.So yep, I got the film. I can unpick the meaning and the motives, and revel in the artistry and creativity. Absolutely. I could associate myself only with the positives in a self-gratifying sense of pretension, ignoring the flaws. Then again, I could equally write the entire thing off as a misjudged, self-indulgent steaming poo. And in truth, I'm still not sure where I sit, but I'm neither extreme. All I know is, there was much of this extremely flawed and frustrating film that I thoroughly enjoyed. Enough to want to watch it a second time, and yet enough to never go near it again.Fence-sitting aside, as much as it was artistically pleasing and intriguing, and memorable, the greater sin of utter confusion and lack of narrative and emotional cohesion and generosity toward the viewer would lead me to ultimately suggest it's less a roaring success than a totally misjudged fail, most likely to raise a frown than a smile.",The Green Knight

693,RoastedKowakianMonkeyLizard,This is not an action-adventure fantasy film.,9,30 July 2021,"Though it may seem unknightly, The Green Knight (2021) will not hold your hand. It takes its sweet time, it doesn't try to engage the viewer with adrenaline-fueled swashbuckling sequences of adventure. It does not care if you can't clearly understand the English of old.All of these seem like flaws but they're actually the movie's greatest strengths. The Green Knight does not actively try to be easy to follow both visually or through dialogue, and in doing so becomes so much more immersive and hypnotic. Instead of relying on drawn-out action sequences, David Lowery tries to enchant you with The Green Knight's cinematography and mise-en-scene, and succeeds.The film is very light on plot as it is a decidedly simple adaptation of a simple legend. So if you're into movies with a particularly ambitious story, this definitely isn't the movie for you. What The Green Knight lacks in terms of being a commercially appealing film, it makes up for by being cinema. And as cinema, it is profound.This is an exquisite treat for the eyes and the ears. The score, the sound design, the camerawork, the lighting, the editing, the costumes, the effects, everything superbly comes together to create something wholly original.This is not an action film.

The whole movie is some guy wandering the forests searching for a knight so the knight can kill him. This movie is awful and nowhere near the 7.8 rating it has. Must be people that made the movie who wrote the reviews and not actually people who watched it.

Also I felt that at least 30 minutes could be shaved off this movie, the pacing is just way off in some of the scenes and they seem to drag on and on.IMO, the original poem the movie is based on is much better. The motives of characters are actually explained, and you have a much better sense of why people are doing the things they do.

715,Fab3rge,The Green (Onion) Knight,8,16 October 2021,"The Green Knight is not your typical movie. Like an onion, there are so many layers, and with each passing day I think more about what this movie is truly about.In a world where most people want everything given to them on a plate, this will not be appreciated by all. It is (akin to) an abstract work of art - not everyone is going to like it - but to those who do, it is quite spectacular.It can be viewed quite literally as it comes - a man on a journey, to seek out the Green Knight.So many reviews have said, in the story, 'nothing ever happens', etc. And yes, the action is extremely light. But it is more than just that. You cannot simply compare it to many other films as there are not many others like it.Firstly, get the negatives out of the way.The Green Knight could be thought of as a movie including King Arthur after seeing the trailer, but it is not really, and I can see why people might think that way. It is misleading, and gives away a couple of spoilers too. However, the movie is based on poems and Arthurian-legend, although the director David Lowery has intentionally not used actual names (with exception to Gawain and a couple of other characters) for ambiguity - a strong theme within.The movie assumes you know a little about folklore, and one scene in particular made little sense to me. Also, there were two scenes that were shot so dark, I could not make sense of what was going on. Thematic perhaps, but not good for the big screen. A little common sense would have prevailed there, I think.Otherwise, I loved The Green Knight. The acting was superb, especially Alicia Vikander, who steals every scene she's in. Dev Patel gets a raw deal from some reviews on here - I thought he was pretty good, especially in the last third of the movie when Gawain starts to near the end of his journey. I felt him mature as a man as the story progressed.The cinematography is amazing. It really is a treat of colours, textures, and camera angles. The sound was great too. The creaky Green Knight was especially creepy, it added tremendously to the tension of the scenes.You really have to read between the lines in this story as it gets told. This is not a movie where everything is explained for you, and at times perhaps overly-ambiguous.For example, when the film starts, our 'hero' Gawain (pronounced Gar-win apparently) is seen laying with a woman in a brothel, on Christmas Eve, no less. He's a 20-something-year old lad, living at home with his mum, who loves him but seems disappointed with how he's turned out in life.He goes to court on Christmas, where he drinks alone amongst friends, and bemoans to the King about how he yearns to be a legend and a knight one day like his peers around the table. Then the Green Knight appears, challenging anyone to ""land a blow"" against him - but they have to seek him out in exactly one year to receive the exact retribution.The older knights are standoffish, as they smell a trap, and their experience has taught them to be wary of such temptation.Gawain, however, keen to show his worth to his elders and that he is worthy of their adulation, takes up the Knight's challenge.At first, it seems like just a film about a man trying to be knight. But it's much more than that.Gawain wishes to be a knight, but also one of the guys. To be more than just the King's nephew. He wants to be considered a proper man.He wants adventure, and to be remembered as a legend like his fellows. But as the Queen reminds him, his life has barely begun. In other words, there is still time to achieve greatness.His actions get him into the worst peril he has ever imagined, and he begins to wonder what is going to happen to him. At first, he loves being the great Gawain the knight slayer. But the feeling soon turns into regret, into fear of his impending doom.But also, if Gawain didn't kill the knight, he would not have been revered as much as he became. People loved him for what he did, but perhaps not for who he was. He probably would never have left his home, or his comfort zone, or ever been forced to make difficult decisions. After all, he is second in line to the throne. His life would have been set for him pretty much from birth.It is possibly also a tale of thinking before you leap; of the consequences of your actions. I am sure Gawain never imagined (nor anyone else) what would happen next.There is a ton to discuss about this movie - topics including fidelity, chastity, class structure, motivation, trust... and the word that gets used a lot in The Green Knight: Honour.Is it better to live in dishonour, or die with honour?And what actions would you take if you are the only one who knows what you did? Are actions bad because people know, or because they are immoral?What is the value of your word?If you say you will do something, at what price do you decide you would not honour it?Why do you give your word to some, but not others?What man has never questioned themselves or their own worth? Watching this film made me really think about what I had done with my life - all the people I had tried to impress with actions not in sync with my character, or the trouble I had always got myself in to (and out of) in my youth.Young Gawain would have had a lot of time on his journey to the Green Chapel to contemplate his existence - his relationships, his past, what has been and what could have been...The Green Knight needs a second viewing to really appreciate it in full, and as I said before, does not spell everything out for you, with it's heavy use of metaphors. I would consider the movie an allegory for the meaning of what is important in One's own life.The movie in essence reminds me of that old Braveheart quote:
""Every man dies. Not every man really lives"".",The Green Knight

The music was the only thing that actually managed to achieve drama. The screenplay? The movie? Could lull a sick baby to sleep. At times I wanted to cut off my own head.Too much useless crap added.

730,Silverandgrey,A visually stunning fever dream,6,29 August 2021,"There are scenes and imagery in this movie that makes you whisper 'wow' to yourself. The cinematography is just stunning, playing with colours, scale, and other fantastical elements. For that aspect alone, I didn't feel like I wasted my time watching this.Then again, no movie can survive purely on beautiful shots.Let me just say that I am a fan of A24, and of the actors in this film. Of course I knew it was going to be a slow burn art house movie but even then, it did not prepare me for this.While the story is linear for the most part, there are a lot of scenes which are dream-like. You just have to accept that once Gawain sets off on his adventure to find the Green Knight, that what he experiences can't fully be trusted.Dialogue is sparse which is alright, the film relies heavily on imagery and atmospheric score. It also requires some prior knowledge about Gawain's mother being Morgan Le Fay who likes testing the characters of Arthur's knights to better understand her motivations.The biggest shortcoming of this is that just like if you were dreaming, you have a loose idea of where you're going but it's hard to make any sense of it. The things Gawain encounters during his journey which were supposed to test his character honestly felt quite pointless. Some demonstrate that he's not a virtuous or particularly courageous or smart man, while other encounters make you wonder if they just added these shots because they thought it would look cool.I honestly don't quite know what to make of this film. It is only based on cinematography alone that I give this a 6. But did I enjoy it? Not really.",The Green Knight

I had no clue what was happening or what the characters were about. To me it's just a weird collection of fancy words and music. The acting was good and the visuals look good. Other then that it's just not good and possibly one of most boring things I have watched this year. I didn't know what to expect but this wasn't it. Too bad.,The Green Knight
732,jakehillsxc,"Misleading, Meandering, and a huge let down.",3,4 August 2021,"This review is long because I wanted to rant against the film, so if you are just glancing and flipping through to determine if you want to see this movie, I will leave a quick blurb that should be helpful. This move is meandering and surreal. It is at parts a good and cinematic adaptation, but at most other moments is loose and surrealist storytelling that leaves the viewer begging each scene to end. The visuals are engaging and the acting is mostly good, so see it at your own risk.I went into this film expecting something somewhat artistic, but also cinematic and faithful adaptation of the epic English poem. What I watched instead was a film saturated with meandering pretense that lacked any notion of subtlety. I am one who enjoys a meaningful film, and I enjoy good storytelling. I don't need a film to hold my hand, be full of dialogue, or to adhere to typical narrative structure. I expected this film to break norms of Arthurian literature, I came ready for that. I did not get anything within the realm of what I was expecting.Before I tear into the movie some more, I will give it credit for what I think was done right. Ralph Ineson's Green Knight looks great and is performed well. The direction early in the film creates an immersive setting and the Christmas Game is legitimately creepy and atmospheric. The first 20 minutes were my favorite. We see creepy witchy activity by Gawain's mother, Morgan Le Fay, and a more caring fatherly dynamic between Gawain and Arthur. I also don't mind a feeble and older Arthur, it adds implications for the success of his nephew. I enjoy Dev Patel's performance, even if I don't love the script.Now, I must mention the visuals, as a trasition between things I do and don't like. This movie has been praised so far by critics and fans alike for its cinematography. I think the film has captivating visuals, and has intersting shots here and there, but most of its shot composition are similar shots. It is a good looking movie, I think.Now, for the bad. I agree that some films can be indicting to the viewer and that's okay. Scenes in movies can make you uncomfortable! That's part of the art of film and fiction. But this movie not only makes you uncomfortable at parts, such as with Gawain and the Lady of the house (which also removes any undertones and subtlety that the poem had and puts everything out in the open), but the movie is also tedious to watch! It is a slog, man. Each scene after the opening 20 minutes is drawn out and lonely. I understand what each of the sequence was trying to do, but that doesn't mean it succeeded. When we return to character interactions at the Lord's house, interactions are lengthy, boring, and uncomfortable. The acting is good, although Vikander chews scenery in a lot of her scenes.The film ends on a good note, although not the endless montage of Gawain's life if he was a coward. No, instead, I like the interaction between Gawain and the Knight, where there is a welcome change to the narrative in Gawain's acceptance of death and courage. Outside of this and the beginning, I did not enjoy the film and warn viewers to know what they are seeing before they attend.",The Green Knight

734,thomas-ero,Great Story. Never What You Expect.,8,29 October 2021,"This is really a beautiful film about how we think we know whereas we don't really know at all, and how there is a price for everything.It's about fantasy vs reality. This doesn't mean there is no magic in it. There is a lot of magic and wonder. But it is an adult and mature and practical kind of magic, not childish and absurd ""everything will be alright"" kind of fantasies. It's also about how human arrogance assumes a certain view of the world but nature's unconventional ways win in the end.Gawain is a young, foolish and ambitious wannabe knight who accepts a challenge duel from a mysterious being. He thinks he has the upper hand. But as circumstances unfold he is humbled and learns the realities of life, harsh truths and the way of nature.With a lot of the crap coming out of Hollywood these days, this a refreshing and original perspective.

744,scottkieffer,"A very unique, rewarding, & moody myth",9,13 August 2021,"Like others, I will avoid any spoilers for this wholly original & engaging journey through a mythic, dreamlike world.This is not an action movie or a period piece, it is about the idea of ""the hero's journey"" - not just following a journey, but exploring what those themes even mean.The setting might be medieval, but it's not like any other ""knights"" movie - the closest comparison I can think of is a blend of influences from Nomadland, Pan's Labyrinth, & a Ghibli/Miyazaki film (like Princess Mononoke).If it seems odd how those can mix... just watch it (especially if you like even one of the movies I mentioned).Some notes on its quality (before I get into its theme/purpose):Amazing cinematography & visuals, it was a true delight to watch & the camerawork was varied, inventive & really brought a lot to it. I don't normally notice cinematography in modern films unless it's really good or really bad - this one is great!Soundtrack is also very unique & really builds the atmosphere, see it in a theater if you can to get the full ambience & you won't be disappointed.Acting is very good, if a bit understated. The role parts have limited screen time but make the most of it. Harris, Edgerton, Vikander & Barry Keoghan all lit up their scenes & were memorable in the best way. Dev Patel is good as well, carrying the weight of the movie.Plot/pacing were quite good, I could see this maybe getting a screenplay nod, considering how unique & engaging it is. Directing work was top-notch as well.On the theme... Green Knight is really about a journey through or into the soul. Not just the character's journey, but the film really pulls you in to ask questions about your own journey too.In that way, it really reminded me of what was so powerful about Nomadland. Both films are less about giving you answers, than about getting you to ask the right questions. Both made me feel & think about things in a way that no other movies really have... they set up scenes that let you feel things of your own, not simply feeling what you're supposed to feel, or feeling for fake characters (like the shallow sympathy or ""warm fuzzy"" of a Hallmark movie).Nomadland was all about the past, reflecting on pain, regrets, past joys, & little victories. The Green Knight is about moving forward, questioning the ideas of purpose, of values, of legacy.The film embraces feelings of failure, of loneliness, & of being lost or trapped in much the same way that the best Miyazaki films do (& some of the plot/characters/etc. Reminded me of his works like Nausica & Princess Mononoke). Like Miyazaki, it doesn't shy away from uncomfortable feelings, but wants to confront them & help us to see them in a little clearer light. Also, both are deft at using landscape/setting to really visualize & heighten those feelings.Finally... if you're wondering the tone or vibe of it, Pan's Labyrinth is probably the closest. Visually they are similar, the dreamlike or mythic quality is similar too. If you like Guillermo Del Toro's best works, give this a try.I won't say this movie is for everyone, as it's certainly far from a generic popcorn flick - but in the best way possible.If any of those themes, comparisons, or ideas sound even remotely intriguing, you owe it to yourself to experience this (and in a distraction free setting, ideally an actual theater for the best effect).",The Green Knight

He's not portrayed as a knight at all, he's barely a man, more like lost teenager with identity problems, rather dumb since he's got nothing interesting to say for the whole movie. From the first scene to the last he's complatelly lost, don't know what he's doing and why, everything for him is an accident.The moral sense of the original legend is completely abandoned here, instead of strength of virtue we got all of sudden a smart guy who foresee the consequences.",The Green Knight

A medieval chivalric allegory (it's based on the 14th century poem ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"") which makes little or no attempt - refreshingly enough! - to adapt to a more modern storytelling technique in order to make itself more easily accessible to the average 21st century moviegoer. If you want and expect an action packed knightly adventure film, this is definitely not for you. If you enjoyed ""Pan's Labyrinth"", however, with all of its symbolism and allegory, there's a good chance that you'll be as spellbound by this as I was!! And Dev Patel, in the leading role...

There were so many pointless scenes that didn't add anything to the story. I felt this whole film could have been edited down to 30mins
The voice audio was awful. The music was loud but we had to add subtitles to understand what some of the characters were saying as we couldn't hear them.

The plot setup hooked me immediately, after that things start going down hill. On a technical note this movie is masterful. The acting, cinematography, color grading, sound design, and the wardrobe are just amazing. Some of the dialog almost had me in tears, specially between Gawain and Arthur. Sadly the story takes a tumble during the second act.A lot of the problems were just inconveniences that resolved themselves because, well the plot needs those things to be resolved. I've studied the original poem so I kind of had an idea of how the story would unfold and unfortunately, the way they interpreted it was very toned down. I also didn't like that Gawain's character doesn't develop much throughout his journey.Overall this movie is great to look at and has some really good dialog, I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy watching it, but I don't think there's a reason to ever watch it again.Also, they left out some of the scenes from the trailer and I was kind of looking forward to seeing them.

It's much different than most Hollywood blockbusters, but at least for me that's a thing I welcome with open arms.Ultimately, I think another watch and some time to think on it will truly tell how this movie is, but I feel like it could be something special that just isn't obvious.My advice is to go in expecting a slow pace, and keep an open mind.

804,roadkill6,A Visual Spectacle That Lacks Substance,3,31 July 2021,"The original story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a morality tale about a knight who fails a test of honor, but is redeemed in the end. This film is not that story. It starts out well enough, but both Gawain (not a knight in this version) and his story get lost along the way.The opportunities for character development throughout Gawain's quest are set aside in exchange for visual spectacle and dead-end subplots and the original ending was far more satisfying than this non-ending.It is beautifully filmed, the acting is superb, and David Lowery deserves a lot of credit for his excellent direction, but the writing falls flat. Storylines are set up and then never concluded, there are a few deus ex machina moments for no particular reason, some of the best parts of the original story were changed (like the Green Knight's insulting challenge to Arthur), and the whole movie suffers as a result.If you've never read the original story and you just want pretty pictures, a dark and foreboding atmosphere, and closeup shots of Dev Patel (who acted the heck out of this film) looking serious, then this movie will scratch that itch. If, on the other hand, you're expecting to see the tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight or care at all about plot holes or coherent character arcs, then you might want to give this one a miss.Maybe this film will inspire someone to make a faithful adaptation of the original story someday.",The Green Knight

Baraka and Samsara are two of my favourites to watch in a VR cinema when I want to relax. Neither of these have a plot and are just beautifully shot scenes, slowly passing by.I mention this because The Green Knight feels like it's trying to emulate them but adding a plot and acting. It fails miserably. The actors do act well but it feels like they have nothing to do and you really do not care what happens at any point. There is no depth here - just a 15 minute story slowed down to the slowest crawl possible.If this director does something like Baraka, I'd be interested but they should not apply this filming technique to something with a plot.",The Green Knight

And then there's Sean Harris who can't act badly, and Dev Patel, ditto. And Joel Edgerton and Alicia Vikander. Stellar.Trolls didn't like Dev Patel playing Arthur's nephew. Trolls are trolls. I, for one, was absolutely convinced that a role in a tale has no colour. Dev was perfect in the part. And that's really what matters.I wished they had stickers to the original ending of the tale, which I find more interesting, but still, loved it.I wish I can see more of this director soon.

This is not one of those - I certainly wish I had read some before the viewing in this case!Some defended their higher scores reviews with belittling other viewers reviews assuming they all are looking for high impact action adventure, or Game of Thrones level complexity and effects. Or touted.it by comparing it to other movies that have a slow build, or beautiful scenes and cinematography. Most of those things had other qualities that made them work, that made them worth the time investment.There is no payoff, there is no real Hero, no true villian - The quest is not great and is often just confused meandering, What virtues do come up are fleeting and minimal compared to the many weakness's of the main character. ~ Which make some or at least one of his earlier actions seem unlikely - yet the majority of the film is based on that out of character event. Had it been the first glimmer of who the character would become it would work.More than one person called this a snooze fest, I totally see how that can happen as viewers hang in tenaciously waiting for something, Anything!... to make it all worth while.",The Green Knight

Each shot is gorgeous, perfectly framed, and almost always looks like a painting. It is a character study, which means the film will probably be polarizing for the average movie goer - and judging by some of the reviews I've seen on here, I am right. Dev Patel gives an amazing performance as the lead in the film, and he carries much of the weight of the film on his shoulders because it is his characters story. Apart from one scene involving a boy our protagonist encounters on his journey, which felt unnecessary and slowed the story of the film down a bit, everything else is flawlessly made. If you're a lover of cinema, I think that there is much about this film for you to enjoy. I will be buying it when it comes out, that is a certainty.

The rest of my party was so bored that most of them fell asleep and I don't blame them.I am a huge fan of art house cinema and thoughtfulness being part of the experience of film. But don't listen to the armchair critics that believe suffering through a film confused is the same as enjoying a film.The plot was convoluted and completely experimental in respect to the original narrative. The chemistry just isn't there with any of the actors, which is sad for Dev Patel because he does have the chops. And the key choices made on part of film makers took the most important moments and made them vague and confusing. This isn't useful to make the film better.

Pay attention and be not distracted, for you could miss a lot in mere increments of masterfully paced time. And be honest with yourself as you partake in the tale. It will only add to the phycological element. No technique scuttled in the telling. ""All meat on the bone"", as it were.Even if this tale is known to you, you shall not be voided any intrigue, originality or effective suspense. The strength in this film sits firmly on the intensity, character relevance, immersive perspective and grand expression among a collection of forgotten codes and archaic truths. Eloquently illustrates the question, ""what is the true quest of a knight's test?""I missed not a beat. Which leads me to the only real problem I was left hanging with. Why, though, the arrows that looked like something you just picked up at a local sporting goods store? I may have given this a movie a perfect ten had it not been for that one small detail. It appeared to be pertinent to no resolve. I deduce it means either it I'm makin a big deal of it or that's the one thing I did miss. However, It didn't lay a scratch to the experience at hand.The Green Knight is one of few movies that have ever ""spoken"" to me. This may not be the movie I watch a thousand more times, but that's only so I never tire of it. I will definitely have it in my library to enjoy lifelong.

People who really liked its meanings, its technical aspects etc and gave it great reviews and those who are getting annoyed by those people who believe that are more intellectual and try to give deep meanings to shallow movies, and so they gave it on purpose 1 or 2 out of 10.Honestly, these type of fights are so boring and do not fit into the world of the cinema.Anyway, I will be as objective as I can putting aside crtitics' and other reviews.Before going into the cinema i read some comments that it is quite complex and is based on a poem so I decided to prepare in advance (as I advice everyone to do). Hence, i read the story of the poem on which the movie was based.The movie is by no means a bad movie. It is actualy a very good movie. Technically is amazingly done. From the costumes, to the musical score and the cinematograph you are being transferred to a magical world which (if you can exclude storyline) you will definitely enjoy. Its an adult fairytale. A folklore story with knights, witches, surrealism, everything.But let us not forget that the movie is a based on a poem so there are some themes you can extract from it. The poem was written in the 14th century so its themes may not be relevant to a modern audience although i highly doubt it. Courage, facing you own fate, staying loyal to your words are just a few meanings you can give and are of course timeless.The movie, as well as every poem, is full of symbolisms. From the colours mentioned (green, red) to the garment that was provided to our hero, to everyone he meets along his journey I am sure there is symbolism which can be given. If I understood everything? Definitely not! I gave some meanings while watching it but in the end interpretation is up to each viewer.I am also quite impressed with some reviews regarding the pace of the film. The film is not slow (at least not slower than for example ""the revenant"", a movie which is again about the journey of a hero and which has been getting rave reviews). I did find myself getting a bit tired at some points but the comments is getting are just unfair to the movie.All in all, is an enjoyable movie which I suggest you to watch (especially in the big screen). I beg you do not give any attention to reviews of 1/10 or 2/10 . They do not represent the reality and its just a stupid fight between the viewers.",The Green Knight

The Green Knight accomplishes at many ways. The story is so short yet so long. The movie accomplishes at making the viewer feel Gaiwans never ending,disastrious journey. The use of sound,editing and beautiful shots creates such a beautiful atmosphere that i never wanted it to end. This was one of those rare movies that really comforted me and felt like a fever dream.

However the main turn off was the film's very narrow tonal range. There are a few individual scenes here and there that work for their ability to evoke an otherworldly atmosphere.

At that time all the Arthurian Legends were and are portrayed by Anglo-Saxon men and native born Britons. Yet now, we are led to believe that Sir Gawain is of Indian descent. I can only imagine that they are catering to the many thousands of immigrants that have arrived in Britain.",The Green Knight
859,CasualReviewer2021,Poor Storytelling,4,7 September 2021,"This story is based on a short poem, written by an anonymous poet. In the popular story, the poet describes the hero (Sir Gawain) encountering giants, warriors, etc., on his way to meet the Green Knight to fulfill a commitment. The cinematography was beautiful, the acting was great, and the score was brilliant.This review rating is low because the film is poor at storytelling. Great storytelling can happen with little or no dialogue, and the storytelling in this film was not great. Although the director took this story in a direction I found disappointing, more emotion from the characters would have made it more palatable. The acting was great but the film lacked emotion.Instead of elaborating on specific events listed in the poem, the director changed much of the core story, which left much to be desired. Because the original Green Knight story was thrown out, it was difficult to make other parts of the film mesh, like the scene with Sir Gawain at the lord's castle (the lord was the Green Knight in the poem). Certain parts from the poem were included for what seems like no particular reason, then other parts were excluded that could have added much more to the story. I don't feel the director was able to make good use of the source material available. I also feel the director changed the story in a way that takes away from romantic, chivalric tales.Major Literary Differences:
Because I'm rating the film, I don't allow literary differences to affect the film score. However, I will note, I was very disappointed with the director's decision to have Sir Gawain commit adultery. Below are some key differences:In the poem, Sir Gawain is a young knight who takes on this challenge from a stranger and sets out on his quest the following year. In the film, he is a whiny drunkard and does not want to travel to meet the Green Knight and King Arthur has to force him.In the poem, the Green Knight is pestering King Arthur's court at the behest of one of Merlin's former students. He later reveals himself to be the lord of a castle Sir Gawain encounters. In the film, the Green Knight is conjured up by witches at the behest of Sir Gawain's mother.In the poem, Sir Gawain faces the temptation of adultery and remains chivalric. In the film, he gives into temptation.Because the director threw out the story of the actual Green Knight, many of the interactions at the lord's castle held no relevance to the story. Because the lord is not the Green Knight, there is not much of a point to this part of the film, except for the infidelity scene.In the poem, it states that Sir Gawain bested all opponents he encountered on his journey. However, he is subdued and taken captive by three kids immediately upon beginning his journey.",The Green Knight

Boredom nonsensical scenes, and scenes that felt like pure torture told me many times, to walk away.

That isn't a knock, it's simply a matter of taste and expectations for certain movie goers.That being said, this movie left me feeling like I wasted my time. The point driven by the movie and its ending isn't particularly unique, nor thought provoking. Quite frankly, it hit me the same way the ""Mother"" movie did, where it knew what is was trying to do and decided to leave the movie audience completely absent of intrigue or, you know, entertainment.However, I will say the environments were beautiful. The actors were clearly convinced of the movie's purpose, as I can't fault them either.Honestly, it is one of those movies that the ""intellectuals"" and ""professional critics"" think is wonderful, but falls immediately on its face for the masses.By all means, see it for yourself.

I'm also not a fan of cultural appropriation and given that Gawain was a Celt, Celts sometimes had duller complexions, but they were NOT Indian. Historical movies or movies based on historical characters should at least be accurate with the race (or be as close to) as to the origins of the character.I'm sure if Genghis Khan were made today then an actor like John Wayne would not get the part or Saladin would not be portrayed by Rex Harrison and rightly so.As to the film, we'll it's hard to watch, it's so boring that you're attention wanders to other things.

The actors were great, especially Dev Patel, but the scrip and direction of this movie seemed to be much more interested in making some sort of artsy movie than in telling a good story. The end was all wrong from the story. The green knight forgives the blow to his neck because of the honorable way Gawain conducts himself while on his quest. I stayed through the whole movie, hoping it would get better, but ended up giving my teenage daughter my car keys so she could leave about 20 minutes in, which only enforced me sticking it out to the end.",The Green Knight

Chivalrous romance is replaced with grotesque seduction. The most action you'll get is in the Green Knight's interactions. Dialogue is unusually absent for most of the film, and you won't even see exciting historical references anywhere.What you will instead watch is the idea of ""show, not tell"" taken too far: long single-cut scenes, music that rapidly rises and cuts off, and just too many slow build-ups that amount to nothing.

The main character is indeed depicted as human and weak as we are, there is no place for ideal cavalry stereotypes but only for uncertainty, fear and eventually, redundant hallucinations.The genius of the director goes beyond editing, visual effects, screenplay, camera moves in adapting a 14th century Arthurian tale that results astonishingly contemporary in its main themes. Just to highlight a couple of them, the struggle of the man in whom the strive for glory is contrasted by the consciousness of being mortal and the ambiguous relationship with a Mother Nature, the Green Knight, which acts as an ubiquitous, silent judge.To all of you who criticised the non-sense and the slow pace of this movie, you should try to put some effort in seeing the mirror that is cinema and feel Gawain inner clash as the collective battle with our values and with a Nature that, in the end, will always have the final say.",The Green Knight

880,Sc-190781910,Missed the point of the story entirely,1,25 August 2021,"This film was a huge disappointment.If you are familiar with the source material , you will know -
The story in its original form is about virtue. It is about how doing the right thing can be very difficult, and might mean accepting a bad outcome for yourself.The source material is very old, and has 'withstood the test of time' because the values at its heart have rung true for many, many generations.Meanwhile, this film misses all of the reasons that the story exists in the first place.The filmmakers either lack the fibre to understand the story, which beggars belief because its actually quite simple - or, they just decided to cash in on the famous title, and make something else entirely.In addition to not telling the same story or even the same overall 'message', the film is also a jumbled mess. It contains spinning shots, coloured filters, jumping timelines, and all manner of filmmaker toolbelt trickery - but never for any purpose. It references some other legends but never for any reason.Yes, I have seen arty films before - I have enjoyed several. This is not an issue with ""not getting it"". It is the filmmakers who have failed to ""get it"". What a shame.It's the worst film I've seen in a long time.What a tremendous waste of a gigantic opportunity.",The Green Knight

I was hoping that I would get answers for.. Why Giant people? Who is that headless skeleton lady and how did she get his axe back after being stolen?

904,ekimvang,BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL,10,26 August 2021,"I was an English major in college when I studied the original in a class called Medieval and Renaissance Literature. I appreciated the language, but I found the story to be plain boring. Sir Gawain was too clean and noble of a character for my modern tastes. Not in this adaptation. Here, he is the total opposite. He's just Gawain as everyone calls him in the film, not yet Sir Gawain. He's a youngster and a coward. This tiny reversal of his character really pivots the narrative into its own thing and delivers the original work's message better than the original.For all those who are giving this film a horrible review and calling it pretentious, I find it very ironic because it's those same people who need this film the most. I see a bad user review so I click on the user's id to see what that person thinks is a good film. That same person is raving about the latest Mortal Kombat film which I think is horrible, and I'm a Mortal Kombat fan too! So before you decide to watch or not watch a film based on user reviews, it'd be best for you to see if that person is a credible source. Personally, I hardly give user reviews unless I feel like a great film such as this one is being unfairly attacked and berated on. If you walked out of the theatre and didn't stay till that last montage, all I can say is you done missed out. You done bought the ticket and won the lottery, but didn't cash it out.",The Green Knight

The directing, cinematography and music are all excellent. The cast is also great, which is no surprise considering the actors involved (Sean Harris stands out as King Arthur). The idea of a dark and grim retelling of this tale instead of the classic version is a good idea, there's nothing romantic about knighthood in Lowery's take on Sir Gawain's journey. But while I admired the aesthetics and enjoyed the unique atmosphere, I also felt that there's not really much to the plot and found the second half to be a bit boring.

Incredibly cinematic and symbolic scenes with great atmosphere.

I like films that make you think, that leave it up to you to make sense of symbolism and suggestion - But to much just gets confusing. Far to much of this film was left as hard interpretation.

True story of the transformation from young boy to man: boy who was ready to literally kill someone who wasn't armed without hesitation and man who was able to finish ""the fun"" and play by the rules. The story couldn't be fast otherwise it would turn into another ""Hollywood superhero movie"" without any spice and game. It is about internal struggle, but only an adult, thinking and modern person will understand it. Separately, I would like to note the game of Dev Patel - he displayed his character:the little parts as well as major parts, played beautifully and coped with everything. Definitely will be rewatching in the future.P. S. Everyone here is complaining about how the movie is slow - haha!

My husband knows a lot about King Arthur so got some of the messages but we still left unsatisfied and confused. Once he had explained the gist I did get it but if you don't have a diploma in Knight School it may go well over your head as it did me. The intermittent olde englishe writing on the screen was impossible to read due to the swirly script and the endless choral chanting started to grate after a while.I loved the mysterious ethereal and slow paced quality of this film, plus the scenery and the characters, but sadly the story line needed some gaps filling in.

One detour after another, they made zero sense. Then they didn't give you any clues so you could connect a few dots. They have a fox that is semi explained but more questions are created than solved. The ending is even worse.If you were a fan of the other versions, ie... Sean Connery's, or the stuff from the 40's and 50's, forget it.If you want to watch something that leaves you full of questions (or known as the ""WTF ending""), or you're into being unfulfilled, here you go.The visuals were nice, and the costumes were well done.

946,Flightman02,Loved it,10,22 August 2021,I love movies like this. Absolutely stunning visuals. I love the long cuts that leave you wondering whether to feel dread or merely a sense of flatness. The dread is dread and the flatness gives a graininess to the world.The logic that moves the plot forward is often a dream logic. It serves a purpose but is not so linear like our normal cause and effect existence (it is a fantasy movie...).(Nonspecific but possibly some spoilage about the ending) The ending to me seems like an open ended existential question. Why continue living? What's the point? Is the struggle of living ultimately worth it? How can we make our existence worth it?,The Green Knight

I recommend Excalibur if that's what you're in the mood for.Second: this is an art film that opts for ambience, mood, colors, expert acting, and excellence in film making in lieu of appealing to the masses.Thirdly: the theme of the film and the original poem is key to understanding the experience, which is what this film is, an experience. The theme is the relationship between one's character (those who are honorable, virtuous, heroic, etc and those who are not) and one's readiness to face his or her mortality.I found myself overcome with fear at one point during the film contemplating my own date with death.I will say that I did not care for the very ending, but to each his own.

It shows lessons about gaining integrity and not gaining integrity, being true to yourself and others, and bravery doesn't always mean that you will benefit with the spoils of the earth, you may just pay, with everything.

974,jamielonghead,"It's Not Good, and Those Saying it is Have No Concept of the Source Material, and No Idea of What Makes a Good Film",3,14 September 2021,"OK first off, this movie is awful.Secondly, I'm a video editor. It's beautifully shot, and the editing is exceptional. Incredible cinematography. Great lighting, shot selection, costume design, etc. The score is also top notch.But this film's content is atrocious. It's overtly pretentious, trying to play off the audience's ignorance of the source material with great acting and wondrous visuals. I'm an English major with a classical studies minor. I spent an entire semester just learning middle English half-decent enough to be able to read this tale (among others from the time period. Think Canterbury Tales, etc) in it's original language. And then spent half a semester studying it. This movie is so far removed from the original source material it can hardly be called ""The Green Knight."" Those who argue ""it's an adaptation"" or some kind of interpretation have no clue what they are talking about.Even based off the original works, this film has so much egregiously wrong with it. It includes random made-up garbage that doesn't even appear in the original text. It omits keys themes and events that are integral to the overall tale. It's tried to cherry pick a few key ideas and plot elements, added what the screenwriter thinks would be cool to suit their storyline, dressed it up with excellent visuals, and tried to pass it off as some profound work of art. Epic fail in all honesty.For the previous glowing reviewer who wrote ""What the Green Knight lacks in terms of being a commercially appealing film, it makes up for by being cinema. And as cinema, it is profound."" That is ONE OF THE STUPIDEST SENTENCES I HAVE EVER READ. Get the hell outta here.The other previous glowing reviewer who said, ""The payoff after all the nuances are pieced together; it's exceptionally grim, it's oddly soothing and it's all around brilliant. I never read the 14th century poem - I'm curious how many of us have - therefore I can't vouch if this interpretation is faithful but I believe director David Lowery hit on something amazing here"" what in the blue hell are you talking about?! You've never read it, so you have nothing to base your opinion on. It's not grim (maybe soothing for you in some strange way), and definitely not all around brilliant. What exactly did director David Lowery hit on that was so amazing?!""General audiences typically don't like to be challenged.."" This isn't a challenging plot! Anyone can follow this story and it's attempted thematic ideas. It's just executed so poorly and without conviction!""Just because you don't understand the narrative doesn't mean the film's objectively bad."" Very true. But this film is not difficult to understand. And it is objectively bad!The overarching themes of ""chivalry,"" and ""honour,"" and ""evil temptation,"" are present and obvious. The original theme of ""morality"" is there but very ambiguous. The characters are haphazardly thrown into the story with little regard for their significance or any attempt to explain their purposes. They are just randomly inserted into the story and we're left trying to wonder about their true identity/reason for being. Emphasis on Christianity and many Christian values is weak (unlike the original prose) but still a main aspect. But overall this film does nothing to emphasize one or the other, to tie them to any great meaning, and in the end the ""journey"" is really just a long slog with no redeeming qualities and no satisfactory revelation. Random ""moral"" ideas, and hey, you figure out what it all means to you because our picture looks visually stunning!To sum up; awful story, awful execution, boring characters, boring plot line, terrible ""interpretation,"", terrible film. But hey, it looks really great!",The Green Knight

Gradually the events started to turn more weird and story became more unimportant.

Both movies got me very hyped in the beginning only to let me down a moment later.If they only continued with what they started with and put some more realistic content to keep the movie more grounded, i'd give it much higher score.

980,tgwall10,Truly a stunning film,10,30 July 2021,"The Green Knight is another bounding success for A24, David Lowery and Dev Patel, a combination I didn't know I ever needed but one I can never unsee. The movie is eerie, sad, funny, mysterious and filled with this sense of impending dread that builds perfectly to a point where, unless you are very versed on Arthurian lore, brings you to a point where the movie could go in any direction.It's hard to find much I didn't like about this movie after the first watch. Any bad audience review I've read about this film now are from people who aren't going to like anything A24 has done that isn't their staple of improved Hollywood horror flicks and of that I'm convinced.Dev Patel has given some great performances in his career so far but this is undoubtedly my favorite. His you can see deeper aspects to Gawains that aren't obviously stated just through Patels face. The visuals and sounds are some of the best I've ever seen/heard in a fantasy movie, but A24 has a great history of visual and themeatic superiority.I highly recommend seeing this movie on the big screen if you aren't going in expecting an action or a horror. Watch the trailer and think of a slow burning thriller and you'll have a better idea of what you are getting into.",The Green Knight

The visuals were stunning, the acting was fantastic, and they really let you sit in the atmosphere in the movie at times.Dev Patel is fantastic as Sir Gawain, and the journey he embarks upon is filled with meaning and lessons. It's about honor, it's about chivalry, it's about honesty, it's about bravery - all of the things that make a knight, a knight.A lot happens in this movie as Sir Gawain embarks on his journey, and just as he is met with tests along the way, we are forced to ask ourselves what we can learn from this as well.It's a departure from the epic poem in many ways, but it manages to secure the beating heart of the poem and still deliver on the most important part of it: the message.",The Green Knight

The raving reviews are ridiculous, praising the artistry of the movie, and granted the cinematography is very impressive and beautiful with amazing scenery. But 90% of it is pointless with scenes seemingly created to simply use the background. I understand taking liberties with source material and I was prepared for it, but why take a story that is completely about chivalry, honor, and morality, and a knight who embodies all of the above and his journey, only to completely undo it, and make him a sleezy dirtbag sleeping around, who's a cowardly crybaby and doesn't do anything right? I've never seen anyone understand their source material less. A lot of the randomness of the movie could have made more sense if they had stuck with the original character of Gawain and his original journey, but they changed everything about it, and now nothing makes sense.

999,smngsk-223-470534,An ultimately boring movie,1,26 August 2021,"The description is a total lie, there is nothing epic here. As an author of epic fantasy, I know quite well what describes an epic tale, The Green Knight is not.Aside from the indescribable boredom that hit me while watching the movie, it lacks what defines an epic fantasy.Epic fantasy is a genre where something huge is at stake, a grand plot overarching and overreaching should be at the core of the story. The Green Knight has none of those, what is at stake is the life of a single man, there is no grand plot or for that matter a plot to begin with. Frankly, it fails to impress at all counts of being an epic fantasy.I am not in the habit of posting such a scathing review, but The Green Knight deserves it whole heartedly.The pace of the movie is slow, jarringly slow, you will get the sense that the director/writer didn't have enough to tell, so he is filling the time by long swathes of Gawain traveling through the land. At least half of the movie's run time you see Gawain trudging on through his journey. The lord of the rings movies have that, but The Green Knight failed to follow the formula and instead you get extremely bored by Sir Gawain's ever lasting 60 minutes of traveling without any eventful result but reaching some way points where some action happens. Even these waypoints, couldn't hold my interest for long since the action goes nowhere and doesn't progress the plot in any way..As for the story, it is a severely watered down version of Sir Gawain and The Green Knight, where Sir Gawain is a an actual knight not a wannabe, and The Green Knight is a witched lord who eventually becomes his friend. Read the original poem, it is far better than the movie, even if it is 600 years old, and this should tell you a lot.So, I would recommend that you search for your dose of fantasy elsewhere, for The Green Knight offers little to keep your hunger down.",The Green Knight

1005,hazmatblastback,A Rant Towards the Wanna-be Critics (Low Scores),8,11 August 2021,"The fact that so many people on here are giving it low scores speaks volumes as too how ridiculously self absorbed and impatient American society has become. I'm seeing 1's and 2's out the wazoo and people are agreeing with it. That is baffling to me if you are a true fan of cinema. If you actually grasp the meaning of what cinema can do and how artistic it can be, you would at least rate this a 5, even if you hated it. It was to slow for you, it didn't meet your expectations, it wasn't as faithful to the course material as you hoped, you didn't understand certain things; these are all about you. Do you ever sit back and question that maybe a film wasn't made for you in mind? Filmmakers make films THEY want to make how THEY want to make them. Believe it or not, a lot of solid directors films are personal. It's about them, not catering to the viewer. Whether you get it or not isn't their problem. The plot wasn't explained on a silver platter for you? Yes that was the point. It was intentional. The fact you have to be pampered in your cinematic experience is your own personal flaw, not the film's fault. Some of the best films are open to viewer interpretation. I will agree this movie isn't for everyone, but the fact A24 is all over the trailers should tell you something if you know anything about the studio. Their films aren't for the common folk. I'd rather someone be honest and own that they didn't understand the point of it, then make a judgment and call it a bad film. Regardless where you stand, visually this movie is stunning and that can't be argued with. The acting was stellar, also can't be argued with. The score was phenomenal, factual info. Stop letting your pride get in the way and let this film be an example of films you should stay away from. Stick to Hollywood blockbusters and you'll be just fine. Let real cinephiles review real films, and keep your half wit opinions to yourself. Why is this film getting amazing reviews from critics? Because they understand the art of film. You unfortunately do not, so your opinion falls on deaf ears. Take that to the bank, cash it, and let it burn before your eyes like the opening of this film.",The Green Knight

1011,pamelf_,Like the source material: pure poetry,10,27 September 2021,"Visually sumtuous, lyrical, and ambiguous, David Lowery's The Green Knight uses the visual to create pure poetry. It's a story of ambiguity, duality, and the power of nature. It deals with the passage of time, and possible futures, with a surprisingly satisfying open-ended story that feels like a fairytale.It's not fast-paced or full of action. This film is art, to be appreciated as a feast for the senses - not for the casual popcorn viewer, who may find it's slow pace and indirect narrative a bit of a chore. This film requires a bit of effort on the part of the viewer, but is well worth it in the end.",The Green Knight

1014,mattbilen,"Beautifully shot, Confusing as Hell.",4,7 August 2021,"So I love great cinematography, a vivid imagination, and some serious metaphor in a film. However, this movie lingers on shots for so long, it's uncomfortable and unnecessary. It was SO slowly paced, and there isn't much pay off. I didn't hate it (I dislike all the extreme reviews of 1/10). Often that's just not true. Movies are huge undertaking and obviously this guy has some incredible visual chops. It's just needed a serious haircut- a producer in the editing room to speak up. If you drop 30 minutes of melancholy meandering, this might instantly be better. And while I get the over arching symbolism, the small events of the story are basically ""Just Cuz"" with little extra symbolism. It's about honor, and I think I read something like we can't hold people to impossible standards. I also read the director was thankful for the pandemic delay because he was really able to dial in the edit he wanted. Um, ok. Maybe he should have left it.",The Green Knight

Besides me being bothered by the film trying to be ""deep"" I was also annoyed by one of the worst CGI foxes I have ever seen. The only good part of the whole film were the beautiful filming locations as well as the good camera work but that isn't enough for me to think the movie is even worth two stars.

1017,askmrsroberts,Teaser pre-pandemic was the last moment of joy,4,6 September 2021,"I believe the acting/casting and the overall set design and costuming/makeup choices
do redeem the film for Cinema's sake, and were bold choices which might have been used to much greater effect. By presenting the court at Camelot as something other than brightly or even pastel-colored and jovial, even on Christmas day, I felt we were given a dash of humility and reality for always expecting fantasy heroes to be celebrity-visage perfect.Yet, I was disappointed almost as soon as that original teaser image of Dev Patel was revealed as the very first image of the film. Glorious, mysterious and powerful -- it felt out of place as the first image.The title cards in Old English lettering were as problematic as hearing some dialog.I actually had to squirm around often to fight off sleep.I accepted and stayed interested along the lines of King Arthur trying to get better acquainted with his sister's son. This essentially made the role of Morgan le Fey more based in realms of history rather than direct fantasy. She could be the result of conquest.

Easily could have been a half hour short, but was put on .25% speed to stretch it out to two hours. It even feels like watching a video at that pace. Anyone praising this movie is lying to themselves. Those giving it an 8 or 9 are only praising the cinematography. From some of the other reviewers are saying those that don't love this movie are incompetent is beyond pretentious. Some might love the cinematography but it is by far not that impressive compared to other movies that seem to inspire this one. This movie basically has five shot compositions and really poor contrast at parts. In the theater there were parts so foggy and dark you could not see anything in the scene. If you remove the score about 80% of this movie would just be someone staring off in the distance or walking. Bad pacing, no real substance and such a predictable style that is geared at awards. Just because the score makes a scene sound intense doesn't actually add any intensity in this.

This movie is so different from most movies! It is a piece of art when it comes to the cinemagraphic scenes, and music and story. Highly unpredictable, and has a lot of depth in it. Is this a movie for you? If you enjoy sophistication, depth, making your own interpretations, and art in general - there is a high chance that you will really love it.

Acting was good enough but doomed by everything else, which was mediocre to bad.It could have been a great movie; however, the director's storytelling leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the worst pacing I've ever seen in a movie. The pacing is so bad, I don't think anything could have really overcome it.The result was a lack of any compelling characters> Just when you started to get interested/intrigued by a character. The director decides to insert long, panning landscape shots or move to a completely different scene/time, and relied purely on the audience's desire to know the final outcome as the only driving force of the movie. However, the pacing is so bad, I would fully imagine the majority of viewers simply didn't care enough to finish.Overall, very hard to watch., very slow. I think the director thought he was building tension and anticipation, but he only created boredom and exasperation with how poorly pieced together the movie was...at least for me.It was basically 30 minutes of story telling stretched into a 2 hour+ movie.",The Green Knight

Visionary and psychedelic at times, reminding of such authors like Ben Wheatly, the movie can be a bit slow and looses its pace here and there. So it's not your gameofthronesque epic cavalcade and it's far from a romantic adventure. Its experimentalism and psychologism are probably not suitable if you are looking for a 2hour adventure ride, for that you can watch Guy Ritchie's King Arthur.

Although it was visually pleasing, it seemed to lack any sense of modesty or self awareness. The great acting was weighed down by a complete lack of plot development and incomprehensible scenes (not aided in any way by the use of old english dialogue). Every scene seemed to try and use obscure angles and lighting to carry the story, but it instead came across as boring and pretentious. Perhaps it was to give the viewer a sense of dread and boredom; as, instead of watching the movie, I was thinking of what I could do with the rest of my night if I decided to walk out and go home. Little did I know my entire party of 4 people were all thinking the same. In scenes that could have had even a crumb of meaning, the strange camera angles and weak dialogue had me completely lost and wanting more.

Gawain is supposed to be an honorable yet flawed knight who goes on this quest because no one else will and is spared in the end for showing his honor and humanity. It's supposed to be a lesson in how we shouldn't hold people to impossible standards. Yet in this we basically get a non-ending.

The visuals are sumptuous and the sound design is really impressive, with a soundtrack of weird haunting medieval folksy songs.This is a beautiful slow serious film that won't be for everyone.

But it isn't. I'm not saying I understood everything the director meant to display, but come on, give it a chance. Not everything has to be given to you in easy, bite size bits.I didn't fully understand the film, but I enjoyed it. I found it compelling, intriguing and overwhelmingly stunning.I suggest you give it a chance.",The Green Knight

I'm sitting in the theater confused and honestly disappointed. Don't come into this movie wanting action, because there isn't any of that to be found. When the movie ended, we all got up and i honestly thought the movie was bad in the story department. I went in not knowing the story, only knowing that somehow King Arthur was connected to it. The one praise I gave it was that the cinematography and musical score was amazing. By the end, most of my friends were just dissatisfied and didn't even want to discuss what had just been seen. Me on the other hand, I didn't know how to feel other than interested. Later i read and watched videos on the green knight and after thought on it, i think it is one of the best films I have ever seen. Check it out, I can see why many would hate it, but for me, it was one of the oddest, most brilliant experiences I have ever had watching a movie.",The Green Knight

The 5 stars are for the setting, cinematography and acting, which were all excellent, and in fairness, this score would be higher if not offset by the most pointless plot I have ever witnessed by what is being touted as an award winning film. My wife clued in early on in the piece that it was going nowhere. She's like a plotline clairvoyant, though. I just take each scene as it comes and hope for the best, but as it progressed, I developed the uneasy feeling that my insightful wife was going to be right and it indeed was all going nowhere.

I went into this movie knowing nothing about it, and I spent the first part of the movie trying to guess the outcome and flesh out the plot until I realized that it was pretty much entirely an allegory, and I was able to let go of the need to ground this movie and follow a plot. Then, I could just appreciate what was actually being said without the distraction of following a plot. It seems a lot of people were frustratingly looking for a story that wasn't there.Contrary to what's being said, you don't have to be pretentious to enjoy this movie. I enjoyed trying to interpret the allegories, and if you don't enjoy doing that then you probably won't enjoy this movie. Simple as that. It doesn't have to be an ego test.

We witness his journey as he decides to face the Green Knight and we also get a chance to observe his transformation from a noble to a king.There were lots of things, which I found quite phenomenal about this movie: the cinematography, the visuals, the sound effects, the transitions... These aspects not only compliment each other so well, but also set a mood, where tension is at its highest.The acting was also one of the strong points of the movie. Not only Dev Patel did a great job as Sir Gawain, but all the other actors and actresses delivered in their side roles as well.Although the movie does a lot of things well, there were some aspects that did hurt the concept such as the dialogues and the script. There were times that the movie felt quite pointless and dull as well as some sloppy dialogues throughout the movie that hurt this tension, which is the salt and pepper of this movie.As a conclusion, ""The Green Knight"" is a cinematographic masterpiece, however fails to satisfy the audience through its story and dialogues.",The Green Knight

Others (see the amount of one star reviews) won't be so patient, or see it that way.To paraphrase a review from the Los Angeles Review of Books by Wilson Taylor. We live...

The CGI looked incredibly natural which is everything to me because I hate CGI. Not sure who did the special effects but it was Lord of the Rings level of perfection.I was not familiar with King Arthur's stories but I didn't have to be. The film's colors, pace and actors invoke the story's feeling. I don't think this film is for the general public though, I imagine them to be left confused by the plot and pace. If you are an open person who can view a piece of work without any expectations than this film will take you on an amazing journey honey.Dev Patel is radiant. He is simply gorgeous and I hope to see him in more leading man roles.The ending is perfect! Not too on the nose and not too obscure like some art house films will do.

1085,rettadair,This movie makes no sense.,5,15 August 2021,"First off, I'll start with the things I did like. The imagery used in this movie is fantastic. Every shot (except for a few dark scenes) is really artistic and amazing to look at and would be cool to see in more fantasy films, it was kinda like playing Shadow of the Colossus, which it looks a lot like this movie. The acting is also great. Every actor does a great job of portraying his or her character in the film. The score is also really good too, although it can be used a bit too much in places. And also there were amazing practical effects and digital effects, when there was a point I couldn't tell the difference. Now, you may be asking why I gave it a 5/10 if basically everything in the movie I liked? Well because of the one thing I haven't mentioned so far, which ruins the whole film for me. The plot. The plot in this movie makes absolutely no sense. Now I'm the type of person to like mind bending movies where you really have to think, like a Christopher Nolan film. But in this movie absolutely nothing is explained. (This part I'm about to say is a bit spoilerish, but I don't reveal too much) in the beginning there are these thieves that take all of Gawains stuff, and walk away leaving him to die. So you might think we'll see them again and Gawain will get his stuff back? Wrong. They just magically appear with other characters and the only time we ever see the thieves again is when one of the thieves is walking. And that is basically the whole movie. Throw some stuff in and don't explain any of it. And I get it, there's suppose to be symbolism behind some of the characters and objects, but when you start to put themes over plot, then that's where things go off the rails. I really wanted to like this movie, and maybe if it had explained just a few scenes and left others ambiguous then that would've been cool. But nothing can make a bad plot good, no matter how much makeup you put on it.",The Green Knight

I know I'm not into movies like these and that's why its a bad review, and honestly I think others won't too. Overall the movie is a 4/10, it was too boring. And I barely understood there dialogue when speaking... For ex. Thee or some sort. I did indeed watched the movie and I immediately stopped watching when the MC mother got called a witch in the bar and then the MC meeting the king explaining how its already been one year.

I've never read the poem and I didn't watch the trailers. I simply heard it was good so I saw it. That being said, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it.This is a slow burn movie with a lot left to interpretation. It feels like a fairy tale for adults. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and the acting is on point. If that does not sound appealing to you, then I cannot recommend this movie.I believe a lot of negative reviews are misinterpreting the message of the movie, or perhaps over-interpreting.

Along the way, alternate possibilities take place to represent what Sir Gawain must do to overcome his fears and deceit in order to seal his fate as a liar or honorable knight.The Green Knight is a slower paced indie drama with a well crafted selection of characters performed by known talented actors, some returning from the usual A24 cast.",The Green Knight

1092,rwlovig,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,2,7 August 2021,"Roger Ebert would roll over in his grave if he saw that his website gave this movie a score of 100. There is almost nothing positive to say about this mess of a movie.Let's start with the good things. The cinematography was above average, which is why my score is a 2 and not a 1. However, comparing it to movies like City of God, where the cinematography is far superior on a fraction of a budget that this cost to produce, doesn't bode well for this movie.Where to begin with the negative things (and there are a lot)I guess I should start with the fact that there are about 30 minutes dedicated to panning nature shots that have nothing to do with the movie whatsoever. It is filler in every sense of the word.I could also talk about the fact that this movie falls into the category of Fantasy/Adventure and yet there is not a single action scene in this entire movie. With other movies, they tend to make up for this by introducing great dialogue that keeps you sucked into the movie, but this movie doesn't have a single quotable line.They jump from random scene to random scene, which has nothing to with the plot (if there even is one). You could cut out most of these scenes and people wouldn't know the difference.The only reason I could possibly think people are giving positive reviews, is because they are tripping balls while watching this.I recently watched a short film created by someone in high school and it was a million times better than this nonsense.

It's a waste of your time. The $20 is nothing compared to 2 hours lost.Pros: Beautifully and sometimes even ambitiously filmed. The cinematography is top notch and color grading is beautiful. The sets were immaculate.Cons: The movie sucks. Absolutely dreadful. The gorgeous scenes make the utter lack of storytelling and decent taste even worse. If only they had shown the movie to a single friend before releasing it I could've been spared of this tragedy. The first 10 min is interesting. Minutes 10-30 you can skip. Then there's a random 1917-esque three minute horse riding scene out of nowhere that you should watch because it's absolute nonsense. The middle doesn't make sense and the ending is worse.Summary: You want to believe in the good in this world. Likewise, and with its at times stunning visuals, you want to believe the director is taking you on a journey equivalent to the greatest allegories of all time. Pilgrims Progress 2.0.

If we knew a reason why he'd want to chop the head off, a bad temper or just guy wanting to be great, we could've connected more with Gawain. He already showed he doesn't have honor when he lied about his necklace to the lady as well as not telling the husband that he slept with his wife. We could have been hoping he survives at the end instead of the opposite. Did his mom do witchcraft and create the green guy? She also is the one who gave him the waist band to protect him from harm. So it'd seem she created a monster and wanted her son to be great by sleighing him but at the end he takes the waist band off and the Green man says ""good job now off with your head"". So did Gawain do exactly the opposite he was supposed to do which was become great and become a king. So the ending must mean he understood he had no honor and gave up after his future life of king flashed before the slice.

1123,thenewarchetype,Truely Disappointing,2,3 November 2021,"A film about Sir Gawain was an exciting prospect, a rich legend full of adventure and symbolism. The film decided to replace the traditional elements of the story with it's on symbolism and only loosely followed the key stages of the story combined with the slow pacing they succeed in creating a boring tiresome film. This film could easily have been 90 minutes.The lead character in the film is weak, pathetic and lacking virtue and chivalry. He is unworthy of the name Gawain. The film is an inversion of the original story, he fails to show the any of the chivalric qualities of Gawain, friendship, generosity, chastity, courtesy, and piety.The film follows the trend of adding in unnecessary sexual content, worst being the Lady wanking him off and the Lord making an unprovoked homosexual advance on Gawain.The character Winfred was poorly handled having terrible dialogue and delivery by Erin Kellyman.Beautiful settings, costume and visual effects and good performances by are the only redeeming factor.One can only assume that the purpose of this film was to sully the legend as a symbol of Britain and it's identity.

As others have mentioned it's best to go in blind and come out even more so by the lack of victory and overall greed which truly is what our modern day man may experience and expect in return from the ""journey of life"".My only other question was why some scenes seemed to be slightly cut short or maybe just passed over without explanation but again that also made me appreciate it more and left me asking more questions as to why/what/and who was rewarded or even benefited in the end.I definitely want to view again and recommend to anyone who is ready to sit down and have the ability to avoid scrolling their phones while doing so.The soundtrack to me wasn't anything special but it didn't really need to be as I hopefully conveyed, this is a much more honest, sad but true portrayal of expectation vs reality.P. S the actor who plays the ""thief"" or ""scavenger"" is one I recognize from a lot of other great films- I'm way too lazy to look up his name but I felt his ""accent"" was inconsistent?? Again very very minor but thing I noticed but I definitely felt he could have pushed his character much farther/exaggerated more kinda like a golom or completely insane/madman type but it just didn't get there all the way

1133,mattkingsbury-52253,A Beautiful Mess,7,9 October 2021,"The Green Knight might just be the biggest ""mix-bag"" film I've ever seen. Without question, praise must be given to the cinematography and direction - the entire film feels like one long artistic vision, and I can't help but applaud this. The film is completely filled to the brim with bizarreness, sometimes to its detriment. Despite moving at a walking speed, I was surprised how quickly I sat through the film, encapsulated in its world. The main cast for the most part perform to the top degree, but underneath all the style, I don't think there's quite enough substance ""there"" to warrant a higher score. I can't help but feel it's some mad concoction of Apocalypse Now and the Revenant, with a little Blade Runner 2049 thrown in, yet sadly I would be more willing to rewatch those films instead. Also, the usage of vocals in the score does at times distract and overwhelm...I would have preferred slightly less music coverage. But there is definitely a charm and personality within this film - all the way to its rather beautiful climax - that would definitely drag me back for a second viewing.",The Green Knight

1136,rnvzdf,A wonderful film but not for everyone,9,2 August 2021,"I can only surmise that those who are criticising this film as being slow or not explaining scenes or not having much in the way of narrative drive were expecting the usual sort of Hollywood hero movie. You know the sort of film: lots of action, clearly drawn heroes and villains and a pat ending which makes you feel good but doesn't make any assumptions about audience members being prepared to think a little about what they are seeing. This is not that sort of film.There are no heroes or villains here. Even the Green Knight himself is neither evil nor especially good. He is not out for world-domination or to rob and kill people for his nefarious ends. He has no motive other than to present a simple bargain - a sot of Faustian pact, if you will. And the protagonist himself is more anti-hero than hero in the Hollywood mould.So it's about the journey, rather than the destination. The seemingly disjointed scenes serve as tableaux through which Gawain gains a better understanding of himself and what it means to live a life of chivalry and honour - as a knight should. Much like the puppet show that punctuates the early part of the film. Even if it isn't spelled out in Big Letters, there is a point to every scene along the way. It's the journey of life. Or the journey towards redemption, if you want to put a Christian slant on it. Or the eventual acceptance of one's inevitable fate. Or all these things; or none of them. You can interpret the film however you please.But, fundamentally, it is a film that makes you think. So if you like your entertainment served up, pantomime style, with clear heroes and villains, with explanations for everything (whether needed or not) and little or no character development then this is really not for you.However, if you want to see a film that immerses you in its world, is stunningly shot and which stays with you after you leave the cinema then this could be exactly what you are looking for.",The Green Knight

Every event is unexplained and tedious to watch. What was the point of any action taken by the mother, the hunter, and several others? It just is and no one cares. It is so loosely threaded and unbearably slow paced. I felt truly anxious for sitting through hours of mostly just the sound of walking or breathing. I kept waiting for something to happen.

Not only do they speak in Shakespearean English, British accents, and growled whispers, but everything is even more indecipherable because the score overpowers the so-called ""dialogue."" The score was actually beautiful, but unfortunately it was the only thing we could hear.The screenplay itself lacks any decipherable explanation of the plot, and it also failed to name any of the characters. No one in the movie says Gaiwan's name the same way, so i STILL dont know how to pronounce it correctly.The ""adventure"" part of the movie was boring and also made no sense when things would happen because there were no connections between obstacles. There is not a single scene of violence after the first scene of the movie. The ending had no pay off and was not worth waiting the first two hours of the movie for. It was a waste of time. When it finally ended, and everyone in the theater stood up, we heard several murmurs of, ""I have no idea what just happened.""I would give a high grade to the visual affects, but honestly there was nothing special about that. The CGI was horrible, and the aesthetic of the movie itself was also very ugly. When there wasn't CGI, there would just be a close-up of Dev Patel. Those shots ONLY were good because its DEV PATEL! The actual shots themselves were too dark and impossible to see what action was happening.I get A24 is known for experimental movies. I get that its a different kind of movie than we are used to. When your audience can't understand the plot of the movie or even understand what the characters are saying, then you've made a few horrible mistakes. Who approved this movie and put the final O-K to send it to theaters?Also, lets get Dev Patel into actual good movies! This role and the role of Zuko are insults to his acting capabilities.Honestly, i think Tenet would be worth a 2nd watch. But this? No, I'd ever waste my time on The Green Knight ever again.

Not interesting, I know, but it gives you a feeling, why I saw it. Thus not having any reasons at all or having heard anything about it beforehand, I went in and it began.The atmosphere was actually beautiful and the picture had huge advantages, but what I really (really) disliked from the beginning was the movie music. It was very much choir-based and I can't remember, if we could hear an orchestra at any time, I don't think so.This is of course a question of taste, so your call.My main negative point as someone, who has never heard of a green knight or that fairytale, is the plot.Man, that was absurd... Basically the whole story was built around one challenge/quest, which would have never been accepted by anyone with a sane mind.Decorated with a too huge amount of medieval clichés the story began. In between there were a lot of (in my opinion) completely senseless side stories, which haven't further developed the main story at all. They were just odd.It is quite rare, that I was this close to leaving the cinema. I just hoped, that there has to be any kind of explanation at the end.Yeah no, there wasn't... To be be fair, there was at least a medium-sized plot twist at the end, which kinda leaves you chuckling, but that was not at all rewarding for the lost time.I quickly read some of the other reviews here and was first of all surprised, that it got such a good rating (7,6/10, during my review creation). Some of them meant, that the movie really makes you think and question some of the common understandings of how life should be.To be honest, I can sign that, but that doesn't excuse the huge lack and inconsistencies of the story, which in the end led to my rating (and left me with a tremendous amount of questions...).

I kept wondering how a great actor like Dev Patel landed in such a pointless plot. My partner and I sat incredibly bored, hoping some rhyme or reason would come to light. We made it about 40 mins shy of the ending, before walking out. We tried to read explanations about the plot, but they were just as unbearable to get through as the collection of scenes on the big screen.

It was incredibly hard to follow and the disjointed aspects that made it impossible to really understand. Ugh, it was exhausting trying to figure out where the movie was going next. I originally thought that Gawain was going on a magical journey to have an ""adventure"" that could be told to the others in Camelot (seriously, there was that entire conversation with the uncle King, which led me to think the King, Queen and mother were all working to make this big adventure happen so he would have a story to tell). What a disappointment that it wasn't that at all. Add on mother/son strange relationship (I mean what is going on about the green sash from his mother/sexy other man's wife), mushrooms (poison or magic?), headless woman, a possessed fox, road bandits and all the other bru-haha thrown in made me feel slightly hung over by the end of it all.

Very quickly however it becomes apparent that the entirety of this movie is steeped in metaphors through each scene, with little dialogue to carry through any of these scenes or contexualize the message the director is likely trying to convey. Very few times do I find myself checking the clock through a movie, sadly when I did in this case I found I was barely at the half way point. There are title cards throughout the movie taken from the poem upon which it is based, which even had a part of my brain thinking of a Tarantino like build up where the final quarter of the movie would hold some action as thanks for sitting through it. Unfortunately there is no such climax, including the climax of the movie as it were is so lacklustre I can't even say with certainty when it occurs. The soundtrack is interesting albeit monotonous in its lack of variation as the film progresses, admittedly my last good Arthurian movie was Excalibur, and I had hoped for this film to ape it in at least some more climactic moments in the score.

Then imagine you are a director with connections and can get that 10 page short story green lit for a feature length film, but now you have to pad it out.Imagine that and you have exactly what this story feels like. A Sloppily written, overly indulgent character piece about one of the most contemptable character portrayed in a movie in recent memory.The story contains what are effectively 6 short stories, none of which are particularly compelling and none of them have anything at all to do with each other, and all of that happen between act 2 and act 3 of the main story, but ultimately have no effect on that main story or baring on it.In fact if every scene from him leaving the caste till he arrives at the Green Chapel were removed, I would have given this movie 6 maybe 7 stars. These disjointed pointless stories don't help the main character grow so why are they there? He gains nothing to make act 3 easier for him. He learns nothing about himself. We learn nothing about him. So right out of the gate over an hour of this movie is just dead weight episodic filler devoid of meaning.Also the entire main plot of this movie happens on Christmas. A day that is specifically mentioned multiple times. If you are curious why they set the movie during Christmas and not some other time of the year, well so am I. They never say, so why do it.I don't get the critical acclaim for the cinematography either. I have seen art school projects that look better.

Rather then rely on medieval acton sequences, the movie is a story of honor and virtue. An adaptation of the 14th century poem of the same name, a tree like creature called the green knight visits the round table and asks anyone who is courageous and honorable enough to land a strike on him and in return receive the same blow in one year. The cinematography in this movie is amazing, and its even more impressive that that movie was on a 15 million budget and looks better than most movies. The sound design was super awesome to listen to with the sound of the green knight when he moves and talks. The direction on the movie was amazing and left me in awe, and I like how it doesnt rub the plot on your face and lets you watch events unfold for yourself. Now on to the negatives. In my opinion, i kinda feel like the movie dragged on more than it needed to. I feel like at least an hour and 30 minutes would've been a proper length. It kinda make me question stuff to, like why the witch would summon the knight for example. Was it to see if Garwin was honorable enough to be a knight, to test his virtue and courage? Might be. I also found the slow moving shots in the movie to be kinda annoying because it drags on and on and on and it gets hella boring. Reminds me of that damn pie eating scene from A ghost story. (Yes, I know its from the same director). I also kinda wish they had some action as well, not the GOT type action because i felt the movie would lost its charm if it did but something that would of keep me interested. After all, nothing but dialogue scenes and garwin walking and riding his horse does get boring after a while. Aside from those nit picks, I thought the movie was amazing and an interesting spin to the medieval fantasy genre as whole.",The Green Knight

For a whole day after watching, I would think to myself ""what was the point of ___ scene"" (there was too many to count). The characters were poorly developed (if you could even say they developed them at all). I understand what the story was going for, I interpreted that it showed the difference between goodness and greatness of people. Though I was able to interpret a meaning, it was executed so poorly that I can't give it any credit.For those that claim that liking it just requires a deeper understand of cinema, I actually don't believe you.I can't recommend this to anyone, best part of movie was watching people walk out halfway through and day dreaming I was with them.",The Green Knight

Merlin also vaguely looks like Post Malone, which is actually kinda funny.I like the whole realistic take on a knights journey being long, arduous, and a little boring but I wish the director added some humor to this slant. I really like the scene where he gets mugged and stripped on his first day of the journey, as well as the panning camera shot (foreshadowing death if he does nothing). The next scene of him getting up feels super badass and reminds me of John Wick getting up after they thugs beat him up, kill his dog and steal his car. I almost wish he went Braveheart/Gladiator and actually fought somebody, maybe if some other mystical creatures attack him, or he could seek revenge on the robbers with the sword he has. It would also have been more interesting to incorporate the fox dying like the john wick scene, or even as a companion that bites somebody.Overall I was left wanting for a duel, for action, and maybe for some interesting mystical creatures (I felt like the pond and giant people scenes didn't carry much meaning). So really, it didn't hit the spot from a dude's action movie perspective.

1189,rmzmrbpmr,Adapt: to alter for suitability to the new medium,9,19 August 2021,"Nearly every review drips with disdain flowing from a single source: miscalibrated expectations. This is a general problem with modern criticism, and related to the broader problem of intolerance for nuance. That broader problem explains the other cohort of reviews decrying The Green Knight as a failed adaptation of the epic poem.To the reviewers who expected a rollicking action flick: this is a film released by an indie studio, made on a small budget, starring no veterans of blockbuster fame, with a running time of 130 minutes. What were you expecting? Neither the trailers nor the marketing sold you explosions, dragons, passionate love, or sword fights.To the reviewers who claim this is a poor adaptation: I challenge you to finance the production of a five-hour film with narration and dialogue in Middle English, then find actors willing to play in it, then sell it to a distribution company, and actually sell more than 100 tickets. To adapt any work for film requires alteration for the medium; to adapt a 14th century chivalric poem requires more than a little alteration. Good adaptations are works that honor the original while standing independently as distinctive works of film or television.In that regard-as a film-The Green Knight is remarkable. Its depiction of the superstition, material conditions, human behavior, and human psychology of medieval life is excellent. The color, composition, and lighting are spectacular. The story, while not strictly adhering to the poem, does suit filmic storytelling: there are reversals, ambiguities, and rather blatant character development on display. The production design, of the Green Knight character in particular, is worth the price of admission alone, and will likely be the aspect of this film that stands out in my memory for years. The diversity of cast is particularly modern and truly enlivens every scene.And the performances by Dev Patel, Alicia Vikander, Joel Edgerton, and Sarita Choudhury are remarkable. Barry Keoghan is the standout, for my money, bringing a devilish amiability to his role. And Ralph Ineson exudes both menace and charm in his portrayal of the Green Knight.The Green Knight is an impressive, dark, moody medieval fantasy film. It respects the audience's intelligence and leaves much open to interpretation, unlike many siblings in the fantasy genre. With complex storytelling, dazzling cinematography, and compelling performances, this movie will satisfy those whose expectations are calibrated for an amazing 2+ hour, low-budget, independent, art house fantasy.",The Green Knight

He is imperfect like most of the humans and David Lowery has made a good choice of showing him like that.When the Green Knight challenges the Knights in Arthur's Court . Gawain is very hasty in accepting the challenge not thinking about it much. Not realizing his own limits & capabilities but yet to prove himself , he takes the task.But the challenge comes with a price which Gawain is afraid to pay. When the Winter comes due to Arthur's persuasion or to be the Knight he wanted to be , he embarks on the journey to find the Green Knight before the 25th of December. Being confused if he would return alive or not .The knights of Arthur's Era were known to have five virtues. Generosity , Courtesy , Chastity , Friendship & Piety.Gawain in his journey to reach Green Chapel fails miserably, unknown to himself in all the five virtues. When he encounters the Scavenger's Ambush , he is petrified of dying & claims he is not a Knight to the Scavenger. When Winifred asks him to retrieve her head , he asks for something in return. He gives in to the temptations of the lady. He rejects the Fox's warning . He runs away like a coward from the green knight.In the process of his journey. Gawain has become self aware of himself. He has started to see himself of how he really is. This is the transformation we see. The character development of an imperfect man. When he sees the vision of his future self in his final moments of the movie. He realizes that he has to change himself for the better and accepts his fate , honoring the Green Knights words and finally showing courage in the end. He becomes the Knight. The Brave Knight in the words of the Green Knight.This movie is fabulous as it gives hope & courage to many of us out there. To be whatever we want to be and have the courage to keep going on that journey and not become an old version of ourselves regretting the life choices we made. To honor oneself by keeping their word and redeem ourselves for the better , in spite of facing odds.This movie opened my eyes as I am also like Gawain at the start of my journey to green chapel to find the Green Knight.",The Green Knight
1213,davidfitzgerald-36782,Beautiful but shallow plot dressed up as something deeper & more meaningful,6,23 August 2021,"Firstly I didn't dislike this movie, but I didn't particularly feel much of anything when it ended except vague disappointment that the story could have been better executed. The movie is visually stunning, the costume designs especially look great. The acting in general was all good too, but the story pacing and progression seems quite aimless, and it is clear that some things which may seem meaningful at first are just decisions that the the director included because they thought was cool and have no logic behind them, or things which are left unexplained because they have little reasoning for them in the first place in the hope they get overlookedFor instance Gawain is pronounced differently by different actors which the director apparently noticed but allowed because he thought the actors must have researched the pronunciation and apparently didn't care about inconsistency, which is a bizarre decision. Random moments of red colour seem to indicate magic, but then the whole screen is red when he dives into the lake, which you may initially take to be symbolic of something, but it is literally just the director thinking it looked cool. None of this would be that much of an issue in most movies, but the film is very obviously trying to portray itself in an ""everything is meaningful"" way to justify the slow pace and randomness of the plot.

I assume this is because the plot stems from Arthurian legend and is well known story. I can see why was frustrating for many, I was one of you! However don't fret! Upon reflection after understanding original story I gained significantly more appreciation for the film and loved the directors new take on the original story.",The Green Knight

The director was inspired to include his own relationship with his mom in the movie (who cares about the story anyways) and he was inspired to include a random holy head mentioned on the original poem; all because he was inspired.

The ubiquitous hype amongst fans of the genre hailed this film as something that would progress the realm of high fantasy, but the lack of overall cohesion, the irrelevant and frankly bizzare ""side quests"" and the general absence of cathartic resolution left the film resembling a spent box of matches, rather than the firey magical torch it professed to be from the onset.

1239,carljfeltis,Doesn't live up to any positive review,3,29 August 2021,"I wanted to love this movie. I was really hyped up for the cast, and they all did a fantastic job, for what little it was worth. Dev Patel worked so hard to lift this garbage fire off the ground, and Ralph Ineson was incredible for the 3 minutes or so that he got to put in. The supporting cast was mostly fantastic as well.That's where the positives end, though. I studied literature in university and spent a lot of time on medieval lit, which isn't.... very good? I came into this hoping for a modernization with some actual character depth, but instead got a string of generally unrelated vignettes, too true to most writing of the era, which has little to no development or payoff. Things happen for a minute or two here and there. Nothing relates to anything, aside from the fact that it happens to the central character, but he has no agency or importance in the events that unfold.Aside from that, it's not even good on a technical level. The overly loud sound of horse hooves is so comically stupid that it made me totally unable to focus on anything when the horse is on screen. The fox was also ridiculously, unrealistically loud. And they seem to switch cameras back and forth between one that is fine and one that is from 2003 and is uncomfortably and jarringly ""hd,"" like watching Avatar on a cheap, home screen on DVD.Nothing in this film adds up to anything. It's just flashing images for two plus hours, but it's shot in a way to make it seem important. In short; it's an incredibly pretentious, empty film, that doesn't even know what it's pretending to be, because there's no message whatsoever that it is even aspiring to.",The Green Knight

This film was poorly paced, lacked fidelity to the original story and was unable to grasp the moral conclusions of the original tale. Everything about this movie is frustrating if you are familiar with the Arthurian legend. Huge chunks of the story were discarded and replaced by scenes that had either no relevance or just had the actors stare at the camera ""acting."" It reminded me of listening to high schoolers vapid conversations while trying to sound ""deep.""
I wanted to like this movie, I like many slow movies and usually prefer them to faster paced movies but this movie had no substance.

King Arthur said it was a game and it played out like one. The main character goes on his mission and has side quests like a video game would have. There are no battles whatsoever, so I guess you could say these are the boring side quests, but the visuals, directing and acting were great.I'm not a particularly smart person, I don't know the source material and i'm not sure if there was a grand point to this movie.

Nothing really seems original. Shot timing is super familiar and not from stories the writer director or editor have worked on before. This is a mashed production of other peoples ideas and talents.The theft is clear.The story isn't good and the accents are as jumbled as the storytelling. English, Irish, American and Scots seems to be the brick-a-brac accent in this stolen world but as and when it suits the actors to pronounce certain words by mistake and out of character.I feel the creators have gone out and cribbed any other production that has been deemed super cool by the younger and current in fashion generation and taken a poem and mixed it up in a bag and thrown it on a screen to see what happens.Stick with Petes Dragon as that was a clear remake and copied idea that you couldn't mess up, even though you tried. Probably given to you on an indie film set years ago from someone you have now forgotten.Get a grip of yourself this is self indulgent nonsense your audience deserve better than a copy of a copy of a copy or a stolen idea mixed with uncertain direction that pretends to be authentic and artistic.

1253,stabellarius,A brilliant film,9,10 September 2021,"First off, this movie rocks. It is tonally pretty damn spot on in capturing the essence of just how... weird this story is. Much of the story is just baffling and inexplicable. Modern Western storytelling-and this isn't a criticism-is algorithmic, in the sense that Event A occurs, therefore Event B must occur, which triggers Event C. Yes, this is present in the Green Knight: the Green Knight presents a game, Gawain accepts the conditions, thus a conclusion to that choice must be made. But between those points, it follows a form of storytelling tradition entirely absent in the Western Hollywood style of storytelling, which ultimately has its roots in the highbrow intellectual world of avant guard Russian theater theory of the late 1800s, of all places (though that's really a story for another time; a bit deeper dive than an Instagram caption can handle).No, the Green Knight follows a long discarded and often looked down upon folk story tradition common to mediaeval literature that makes them a tad unapproachable to modern tastes. That is, if Hollywood stories are driven by events linked by 'therefores' and 'because ofs', the Green Knight follows a tradition of events linked largely by 'ands.' This happened. And then this happened. And then this. They explore variations all on the same theme, but there is no causality. The order of them could be swapped around with no real change in meaning. Shuffle around Gawain's encounter with Winifred, the Lord and Lady and Ugly Woman, or the thieves and those events don't change in meaning, just sequence. None impact the other, but all add value to the texture of the story itself. It's a tad bit like stories of abstract modern paintings being accidentally hung upside down for years, but still loved by viewers of the painting. Did it matter?",The Green Knight

The last 15 minutes I enjoyed too, even with the ending which will take some time to think about. What was in the middle I didn't enjoy so much, not a lot really happens that's exciting, quite a bit of it seems quite random.It's a slow movie for a certain audience, not the average cinema goer. To appeal to the latter I'd say it needs a good 10-20 minutes shaved off, which is probably doable, even if you lose some of the stunning shots.Dev Patel is great as per usual and is his acting is a high point of the film.

Other than the trailer i will now be a little more honest about the movie.To start: The trailer is misleading you on purpose, makes you think of fighting giants in an epic adventure.The movie is extremely boring, slow and tries to be super cirtical-favourite deep.This was 2 hours straight torture, waiting for ANYTHING interesting to happen.Honestly i was just sitting there to see what happens at the end and how the story may find a way to be good. It didn't. Even the ending was super weird and wannabe deep. I really whish i could have fast-forwarded this movie.After the movie i was literally sad about those two wasted hours. First time ever i regret a movie.I looked it up on IMDB and wow - over 7 rating.How can this happen?My explanation is that there are some super intelligent critics / movie enthusiasts that just have to rate it high to make them think their super-smart to themselves.Probably some guys sitting around talking about how good and deep the movie is and getting a erection of their own good taste and smartness.After seeing this over 7 i really thought i don't want to live on this planet anymore.Well i have to say i am open minded and i can understand that some people like movies like this. Everything good. Not all tastes are the same - also good.But the trailer misleads you on purpose which leads the average joes like me in such a nasty two hour disaster.Nice to see though that the creators needed to trick people here to get even some people to watch this.

The film is full of cinematic, but very strange scenes that provide no context and absolutely confound the theater.Many of the key elements behind the story are not well defined (see the five virtues of a knight).

1325,williamssscott,One of the Great Fantasy Films of All Time,10,31 July 2021,"This film hits every mark. The cinematography stuns and sears into your memory. The acting is spectacular. The music fits perfectly. The pacing is on point, and the story structure works too. It is bold and meaningful but unpretentious. It does not patronize the audience in any way, while staying meaningful. This is a movie about mortality and personal meaning, and in that respect is the perfect spiritual reboot of Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal."" On a thematic level it is the movie Martin Scorsese's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" tried to be. It is deep, meaningful, and unforgettable.General audiences may find its lack of action off-putting, and may not pick up on or relate to the themes. But once you realize what the movie is about (the personal journey towards virtue, and confronting mortality) it should all come together at the end.I walked out of this movie feeling the same way I did after seeing Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"" for the first time. I will have to see it again some time down the road. This is without a doubt one of the greatest fantasy films ever made, and I believe it will in time be recognized as this era's ""The Seventh Seal.""",The Green Knight

Many of the scenes were excruciating, brutally dull and completely drawn out.Words can't truly capture just how painfully slooooooooooow this movie was!

1340,averaine,This film will age well.,8,17 September 2021,"Obviously this is a very divisive film; maybe in part to the false marketing, in part to Arthurian purists, and in part to Lowery simply being a very uncompromisingly slow-burn storyteller. If you go into this film knowing your director, I doubt you will be disappointed (this is the man who gave us a 5 minute uncut, still camera scene in 'A Ghost Story').Visually, the film is stunning. Probably the best shot film I've seen in the past couple of years. I felt fully immersed in the world being portrayed from start to finish. Everything from the set design, cinematography, and visual FX works to transport you into a land of grim, and legendary tales.The Green Knight himself is masterfully re-imagined and brought to life. I was sure there had to be some CGI, but apparently he was entirely practical with makeup and prosthetics. What they achieved is Academy Award worthy. His immense presence is complimented by great sound design both in his movement and his voice. Worth seeing in theaters just for that alone.Now what Lowery really excels at is minimalism and visually-driven storytelling. I'd call him a spiritual cousin to filmmakers like Nicolas Winding Refn. Being also the editor of the film, Lowery's use of montage is particularly effective - the buildup to the Green Knight's appearance is superbly edited. There are sequences that are absolutely beautifully crafted; but may leave some viewers just scratching their head, as they are open to interpretation.Dev Patel carries the film with a powerful performance of this version of Sir Gawain (though I can imagine arthurian purists may hate the differences). He is an incredible talent and I hope he gets to lead more films. Alicia Vikander is another standout, and the rest of the supporting cast is fantastic.If you can allow for creative liberties and are into the more experimental, explorative side of cinema, this film is for you. If you expect anything else, you will be disappointed.Yes there are long drawn out shots, yes it's not the same as the original story, and yes you might think it's a bunch of pretentious wankery. But it is undoubtedly a bold and singular vision of a very unique and passionate director. I was certainly affected by the haunting tone of the film. There is plenty to dissect about what Lowery wanted to achieve with this retelling, and that's why I feel this is a film that I strongly feel will age well.",The Green Knight

It's surprisingly accurate to the original tale. Dev Patel stars as Gawain. He's in every scene and is the really great actor he is. It's so good to see an Indian actor NOT playing ""nerdy ethnic IT guy sidekick"". He owned ""Arthurian squire"" here.Costuming was wonky in places, especially women's. What else is new? I've seen worse. Arthur and Guinevere were Byzantine icons. Background nobles were the usual Victorian Arthurian mix of Norman and Burgundian. Gawain himself was not that bad for a basically fantasy film.Armor? Very little of it. Mail was actually riveted, at least.Language? I was actually impressed: Arthur used ""thou/thee"", mostly correctly. He did use ""thee"" when addressing a plural, though.Other than Gawain, the other characters were not named. The king was The King. Bertilak, Guinevere, Morgan le Fay: they all showed up, but were never named. Guinevere was decidedly NOT anyone's vision of Guinevere!The above gave the film an uneasy feeling of trying very hard to be an accurate version of the original Arthurian romance, while simultaneously trying to not be that at all.Cinematography and scenic design were excellent.Overall: SEE IT!

This makes it difficult to experience and judge, when you have been set-up for a certain movie with specific expectations, but are presented with is a completely different portrayal than what has been communicated and built up in our minds through misleading advertising & promotion.I don't mind slow movies, but without a sense of purpose or explanation to why things are happening or any sense of character progression, you are left to wonder: ""was it all just a pretty picture, with great concepts - and not a lot of soul or sense of something greater?""50/100 (not what I expected)",The Green Knight
1365,kosterthijs14,I am annoyed. Unique is the word. Dev Patel is incredible.,8,15 September 2021,"Most reviewers I read didnt enjoy The Green Knight, that much is clear: one star reviews all around. I think that is unfair in a lot of cases, seen that most of these reviewers admit (in their reviews) that they did not even watch the entire film and bailed out before the ending. When you don't finish a film, you forfit the right to make a final judgement. Don't burn a film that you haven't watched (fully).On the other hand: the studio did mess this one up. The trailer is amazing but not representative of the film itself. Therefore it was to be expected to attract the wrong audiences.This film does not care about the things the audience believes it should. It isn't about an epic confrontation between Gawain and the green knight, but about Gawain and his wish for grandieur. The ending makes the story, and gives clarety on the subject matter of the film, so not having seen the ending is like not having seen the movie at all.In all honesty: the film is more than a tad boring in places, but the uniqueness of everything else happening make it an unforgettable experience, eventhough it might anger some people watching.Do you really want to know more about The Green Knight? Watch it, fully. I recommend it. The film is not for everyone, but when you watch it (front to back) you can write your own review with your honest, well informed opinion.PS: I've seen the film more than once, and the second viewing trencended my initial experience by a lot. Two times is the charm with this one.",The Green Knight

If you wanted an adaptation of ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" you'll be shocked as I was. It's definitely not the movie you want to see. And yet it is too close to original storyline to argue it isn't based on it. Nevertheless the point of the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the original chivalric romance. But what is the new point? It's a tricky question. I have two option 1. Decline of the modern UK, which should be ruled by weak new generations of foreigners, which doesn't have their own story to tell. In this case the choice of Dev Patel makes sense. But of course the director will never accept this. Cancel Culture you know! Cancel culture totally, who needs it anyway:) Though the open ending allows you to think, that these new children of immigrants will be able to rule the country. 2. Criticism of the overprotective style of bringing the children up. In case a youngman continues to count on mother's or mistress's help(girdle) he will ruin everything.

Gawain learns to overcome self-doubt, the fear/inevitability of death and what it takes to truly achieve greatness.Beautiful acting and cinematography. However it is a slow atmospheric movie without much action and the viewer needs to actively pay attention.The main criticism I've seen leveled at the film is: ""the protagonist is stupid"". I disagree that this is a flaw of the film, I'd put aside modern thinking/logic of self preservation and put yourself into the position of the hero, if he doesn't do what he did, he'd be forever seen as a coward, unworthy of being knighted and no reason to ever have a legend/story be told about him.",The Green Knight

Possibly to secure a refund. I felt disappointed my mother and I used our AMC bonus bucks on this movie. I quote my mother's words ""this movie is very weird."" I was expecting a really good retelling of an Arthurian tale. That's not what I got.There were parts that had no explanation of why they were happening, and a scene that played out that just as suddenly didn't happen after all, so the previous scene wasn't particularly meaningful.

Not sure how wrong a person could be.The rating is hugely deceiving and seems like, after looking at the other comments, it's majorly skewed from people purely rating this film based on the cinematography & visuals. Which, to be honest aren't exactly amazing either.Little to no action, as you'd think after watching the trailer. The main action part in the trailer is even completely different in the actual film.Story telling is poor, scenes which don't make sense and are completely disjointed, with a stop/start feel. That, coupled with how slow paced this film is, nearly sent me to sleep on 4 occasions, but I continued on with the hope of a good finish. Nope.Although not intended, some of the scenes are hilarious just because of the stupidity. Won't spoil it but if you do watch it, the scene with the woman in the manor & Dev Patel is a prime example.Haven't watched many films when I get to the end and genuinely feel like I've wasted my time completely.

1409,advocatusperegrini,"Film with a ton of potential, but fails to stick the landing.",4,31 August 2021,"Review: The Green Knight (2021)Very minor spoilers - not relevant if you're familiar with the source material.I watched this film last night, and let it percolate for awhile before starting this review. It is very well directed and shot, doing a very good job of creating both the ""mythic"" feel the story requires, and the gritty, gloomy ambiance that films set in the Medieval period seem to favor these days when trying for ""historical accuracy."" The acting, with one unfortunate exception ranges from good to excellent.But I can't recommend it. Reluctantly, I don't think it's worth the price of a movie ticket, despite its virtues.First, the good, and there's plenty. As I said, the film looks great. And the direction paces things well. The CGI is used, for the most part, judiciously, and when it falters, it's not TOO distracting.As for the acting, if anyone is going to play the hero, Gawain, an aspiring knight whose ambitions, both for honor and for the throne itself are hindered by the fact that he is a flawed, tempted man who really doesn't understand honor completely, they will and should be compared to Dev Patel's outstanding performance. He's thoroughly believable and engaging. You'll be pulling for him to complete his epic quest, at a cost he understands, but has a hard time accepting, even as he ride, crawls, climbs and staggers towards his encounter with the fearsome Green Knight, who due to an excellent job of blending makeup, CGI and practical effects, is genuinely terrifying.There are many, many good performances in the movie. But the one sour note, surprisingly, is the usually excellent Joel Edgerton, who plays ""The Lord,"" as if he's coming down off a weeks long booze and downers bender. I know he's supposed to be ill, but by Camelot, he's supposed to be the King! Denying him any dignity at all takes some of the motivation out of the story - is this who Gawain is meant to be emulating and admiring?!Now, after all this praise, I have to tell you why I don't recommend the movie. I do this with a heavy heart, since I know what, with one small change, this movie could have been. It could have been something very rare - a solid, beautiful, well crafted retelling of one of the most important myths in British history. But it wasn't.I know it is all the rage to ""upset expectations,"" and it's considered real avant-garde stuff to disregard the original theme and thesis of a story to substitute your ""hot take."" But not with something that depends for all its power on the thesis of the story. If you can't bring yourself to respect the source material, make up your own tale, and good on ya. But if you call your film ""The Green Knight,"" and call your hero ""Gawain,"" you should tell the story. Bring your own take, by all means, but to usurp the thesis, that becoming honorable and brave is a process, and that perfection and heroism seldom come in the same package and that the journey is worth the prize, is to destroy what you've spent all that time and effort to do.The really crushing thing is that they throw it all away with the very last line of the movie. If they had stopped before that line, and faded to credits, I'd be telling you to drop everything and see ""The Green Knight."" But it was so disappointing, and made so little sense with the rest of the film, and so completely invalidated everything the hero did, that it outraged me. It didn't even make any sense, it was so out of character, and done in an almost lighthearted manner that it utterly sank the film for me.Where great things are attempted, great risks must be taken. But this wasn't a great effort at the end. It was an unnecessary and unwelcome ""surprise ending,"" sheer hackwork. And so very tragic after so much good work.Maybe when it's available for streaming (not at the $20 price point I paid for it) and if you hit the pause button at just the right moment and pretend that last, fatal line didn't happen. But oh how tragic, the fate of ""The Green Knight!""",The Green Knight

1414,Leonieruth,Legendary This Is Not,1,14 October 2021,"Arthurian legends, chivalrous knights, wizards and fey. I can't get enough of these tales so when I saw The Green Knight advertised on Amazon Prime it was a no brainer. How I wish I'd read the viewer reviews first. Not the official critics reviews who all seem to pile on their sycophantic praise for the film, from style to content and production to cast and crew. What version of the film were they watching? Not the same one as me, that's for sure. I started watching with high hopes but after suffering through the first hour of non-action waiting for something to happen I skip-watched the rest in ten minutes flat to find that nothing does happen. We are treated to long drawn out scenes of Gawain on horseback, plodding his way across a desolate landscape, in less than hospitable weather, interspersed with bits of ""oh look, something might be happening"" moments which were slow, filmed in semi darkness making it difficult to see any activity, if any, on screen at all and, quite frankly, boring. Is this what the critics meant by sumptuous and artful? Throughout the film we are supposed to see Gawain's resolve tested but all I took away from it was that Gawain seemed a little simple, gullible and somewhat stupid rather than a young knight testing his mettle. To top it off we were treated some extremely loud and intrusive incidental music making it difficult to hear what little dialogue there was. Which was probably a blessing in disguise as the very ""let's tick the WOKE box"" cast were all spouting their lines in some very dodgy accents which sounded like a cross between Irish, German, and South London.

As a result there were parts of scenes I didn't properly watch or dialogue I didn't hear in the quieter scenes. As a result at the end of the film there were things I felt were unexplained and unresolved, and the ending didn't seem to be the same as the poem. I put my confusion down to looking after a baby. My overall impression was it looked great, it was suspenseful in parts and Dev Patel was amazing.However, having read the reviews on here it seems my baby isn't the reason for my confusion! And actually lots of things in the film happen with no further explanation or consequence, lots of people couldn't see or hear parts of the film (bad sound mixing?), and the ending was frustrating for all and overall the film doesn't really follow the poem. I'm still confused about how his stuff reappears, why there are two Alicia Vikanders, and what was the point of the scene at the hunter's house. Some scenes are worth a watch, such as the haunted house bit which managed to be funny and sad.The film is beautiful to look at, lots of things happen which seem to have meaning but ultimately don't, and it ends frustratingly.

There is basically, nothing to be excited for, the whole movie is completely devoid of joy, light or life. It's more like a stage play than a actual movie. I can't deny that visually it's pretty impressive, but I couldn't find anything beyond that. I couldn't feel the fascinating fantasy world the Arthurian tales where supposed to provide. I couldn't even feel there was a world in which events where taking place. Every single place or location was somehow on it's own. There was not enough world building and as such, it felt little fake.I was also not very impressed by acting of the cast. While the main hero managed to create a believable character, others weren't that good.Dialogue was extremely badly executed.

The atmosphere is very intentionally crafted and I think they do a good job of that.That being said, it is attached to a completely incoherent, bizarre take on the Arthurian legend. I don't think it's one of those movies I just don't get, because you can catch glimpses of what they were trying to do with the plot, but it honestly just falls very flat and leaves your scratching your head in bafflement as to why they chose to portray different portions of the story that way.

1451,sucrekubb,What did you expect?,8,24 September 2021,"Did you expect a visually stunning film from A24 about an Arthurian legend, adapted from a different, perhaps postmodern and existentialist angle?Disregarding any critiques of pretentiousness, some of which are justified, consider the following:THIS FILM IS VISUALLY BEAUTIFUL - I, rather pretentiously, am not a fan of much films shot on digital cameras. Still, I do fancy eyes such as Villeneuve's and Deakins' in this medium, who have proven it can be done brilliantly. And here it is done incredibly well with effective CGI and beautiful cinematography, set and costume design and even practical effects. In particular I love the shots of Gawain riding through the night and walking through the dreary, rainy marshlands; the beautifully symmetrical shots of the knights at the Christmas feast and the -- I will, however, admit that Lowery gets far too artsy in his direction choices. In particular I recall a shot following Gawain's encounter with the giants, after which the camera zooms in behind Gawain and his fox companion, but does a full 180° rotation, flipping the frame upside down - a decision that I believe added no emotional or meaningful impact to the scene whatsoever. Similarly, I did not like the scene in which Gawain is tied up in the woods after being robbed and the camera does a panoramic twirl of the woodland once round to reveal his skeleton (a glimpse into Gawain's fear) and twice round to return to our hero working to escape this fate. I did not feel any impact from this. We are already aware of what would be the fate of any character dumb enough to give up after simply being tied up. Yes, maybe the point is that Gawain isn't virtuous yet and needs to work to become virtuous and brave - but how many films have we seen this 'tied up hero needs to escape' spiel enacted? Totally unnecessary and ineffective, I felt. And yes, it is slow.THIS FILM HAS MANY OF THE THE 'CLASSIC' FEATURES OF A24 PRODUCTIONS. I've never been as blown away by A24 productions as others - in fact I'm somewhat in rebellion to all the hype. But if you are in favour of the films they put out, you will find many of the defining features of A24 films. In particular, the film carries the same dark, psychedelic, creeping, existential dread that Ari Aster's and Robert Egger's films carry. It is an art house film which, due to its subject matter, can be mistaken for a typical action-packed medieval blockbuster. I admire it's courage for taking the well-known world of Arthurian legend and tackling it from a new angle that isn't very Hollywood at all.IT'S KING ARTHUR WITHOUT THE CLICHÉ. Yes it has the familiars - Merlin, Witchcraft, Chivalry, Apparitions of Saints and Quests for Greatness. But it is not the standard approach of 'the hero's journey'. It is ultimately, a film about death and living. I believe this film uses the story of the Green Knight to set the audience up for the expectation of a great fantasy epic - to confront them with a very Ingmar Bergman reflection on the meaning of death and, therefore the meaning of living. Gawain is a man in hope for honour and greatness. But he hasn't fully developed the grit. He hasn't got the confidence that he is ready to be a Knight. When the Green Knight shows, he challenges him to a duel, where Gawain must win or accept his fate of death a year later. Gawain fails and travels to his fate, only to chicken out. He returns home to a dying Arthur, who crowns him King. He has an illegitimate child, who dies many years later in battle - a battle that fails due to Gawain's poor leadership. The reign of Arthurian legacy falls at the hands of Gawain due to his inadequacy as a Knight and attachment to his own protection and security. The castle comes crumbling down and Gawain loses his head eventually, only later on and in a much less noble way. But he doesn't, by the end this whole last act is revealed to be a vision granted as he waits for the Green Knight to kill him. A vision of the fraud he would become if he didn't readily accept his fate and walk to it, despite the fear and trembling. Gawain realises it would be better to accept your fate and die nobly when the time calls for it, than avoid when it is too late. Because of this, the Green Knight doesn't kill him and he has obtained the true grit of a Knight. It is a very deep, spiritual message.Perhaps, there is pretence in the direction, there is icky sentiment in the romance between Gawain and his lover back home and perhaps the film drags far too much when it needn't, even despite its more subdued approach. And yes, this film has some fat, but the story is tightly woven and told with only the bare essentials, albeit slowly and misguidedly paced. The ending is class, in my humble opinion, and the message was enough to make me believe this film is as honourable and respectful as Gawain himself.Overall, perhaps what you expected was not what I expected and expectations can sometimes make all the difference. I didn't expect a masterpiece and I think I was still somewhat disappointed that I didn't get a perfect one. Much like Gawain, this film aims for greatness and more or less achieves it by the end - though a lot of stumbling and fumbling beforehand makes us wonder if the middling performance in the offset was worth the pay off at the end. Personally, I was moved by the message. It clicked with me finally, in this context, to understand what some spiritual or religious people mean when they say 'learning to die is learning to live' or vice versa. To be ready to die and not want to die. To walk to your death willingly and stare it straight in the eye and to live knowing that it can go from you and to hold it as the beauty and call for courage that it is - this is the message of the film. And a beautiful message and film it is.7/10 - a good film.",The Green Knight

This is a gritty retelling of the classic middle English Arthurian poem which tries to be faithful in some aspects but pushes away from the main narrative to try and be as different as it is with its visual style.The story, as written in the original poem, is one of chivalric honour and a young knight proving himself to his king and uncle.

The cinematography is lush and amazing, but all the amazing mystical elements that the trailer showed are sadly missing.**** SPOILER ALERT *****
For example, the giants walking by. We don't know who or what they are or where they are going and they disappear real quick. The fox! From the trailer I was expecting this really neat mystical talking creature but instead it delivers two lines of dialog near the very end. Many of the other elements are creepy but not scary. I won't even get into the convoluted relationships with Gawain and other characters that are poorly developed and make no sense even though there is ample time to do so.The best part is the 10 min near the end which shows what would have happened if Gawain left with the challenge unfulfilled. In the end we are left with the impression that the Green Knight came to have him return just to teach him a lesson on how to live his life. The motivation for him to return to the Green Knight one year later is also very thin, not ever expressed well.All in all, if you were like me and expecting a wonderful fantasy filled mystical journey, you instead got many beautiful but dreary shots of the countryside. The people who keep proporting that all of A4 films are ""this way"" is basically a crutch for presenting a visually stunning but ultimately dull movie. An entertaining movie has to be more than the sum of its parts, and unfortunately the pieces of this puzzle don't fit together well.",The Green Knight
1477,cmluques,Don't Bother,1,2 August 2021,"I love a depressing French art film more than most people, but David Lowery decided to give this treatment to British Lore and it just doesn't work AT ALL. 2 hour snooze fest with no character arch. Don't bother.",The Green Knight

1480,jworthen-21297,What a horrible movie.,1,6 October 2021,If I could have given less stars I would have. Movie is drawn out about an hour more than need be. Many parts you don't know what's going on because you've been bored for so long you missed something. Movie had an idea and I think of executed correctly it could have been a great movie. But it wasn't and now I've lost two hours of my life.,The Green Knight
1481,ericrobertanderson,"Slow storytelling, clumsy additions to the story",1,23 August 2021,"We watched it on Amazon fo $20. Bored, disappointed in the movie that was so hyped. Could have been 20 minutes shorter. The stuff added to the story actually detracted from it. They gave an insight into the directors & writers minds, but that was not commentary we were looking for. Waste of $20.",The Green Knight
1482,Neoveryde,40 minutes of story...let's make it over 2 hours!,1,22 August 2021,"I generally don't write reviews...but this was so epically bad I had to.I knew that the film maker was going to take liberties and the film was going to be unnecessarily long when our ""hero"" leaves the kingdom and he follows the camera, slowly, for about 3 minutes. At that point I realised...ohhhhh boy.Long winded scenic shots, arbitrary androgynous giants, a dissatisfying ending and only one likeable character being a fox makes this one of the worst...actually no.... THE WORST movie I've ever seen. Ever.The sub-plots to try show the hero's virtues and rise to honour were weak at best and the character growth was lost.Save your time and watch something else...perhaps grass growing on a winter's night during a drought might be more satisfying.",The Green Knight

1485,sharonb-81493,Confused... so confused!,1,9 August 2021,I think my brain committed suicide about 20 minutes in.. it became a personal challenge to stay until the end only to end up gaping at the screen at the end. The inaccuracies of the Arthurian legends isn't even the worst part! Still trying to understand if there is even a plot to this thing.. I don't remember the last time I have seen a movie this bad. My brain in numb.,The Green Knight

1488,nayarbasant,You would want to puke while watching this movie,1,3 September 2021,Never seen a movie worse than this in my life. They should have a rating below 1 also. Would have definitely rated it in negative. Total waste of time.,The Green Knight

1491,deweyhulsey,Absolutely beautifully shot boring writing,3,8 August 2021,The cinematography deserves at least 3 stars. I love thought provoking and obscure films. This felt derivative and under planned.,The Green Knight
1492,rdangould,Completely disappointing,1,26 August 2021,What a underdelivering movie. We should have turned it off but hoped it would eventually pay off. Nope.,The Green Knight
1493,haveigonemental,Not nearly as interesting as it thinks it is.,1,9 August 2021,"I went into this movie with a group of friends, having absolutely no prior knowledge of it's existence of subject matter.Someone I went with said it reminded them of Wes Anderson, and I couldn't disagree more. Wes Anderson goes out of his way to tell a story differently, this movie goes out of its way to not tell a story.This is the type of movie that folks who are afraid of being viewed as unintelligent will claim to love. It's metaphors run so ""deep"" that you'll never even know they were there.I honestly expected critics to be falling out of their chairs laughing at how pretentious and self important this movie attempts to be. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that they loved it.The one thing I will say is that this movie will make for an epic Rifftrax or MST3K down the road. So at least we have that to look forward to.",The Green Knight
1494,bas_maertzdorf,Not everyone cup of tea for sure but still shockingly beautiful,8,31 August 2021,"I'm not a fan of the fantasy genre at all, but I found this film very intriguing. Despite its very slow pace and sometimes overburdening heavy symbolism, I could not pull myself away from the first scene onwards. If one can park the desire for excitement and grandiose spectacle for a moment, what remains is almost perfect: the imagery, the story, the sheer palpability of the atmosphere.Dev Patel's Gawain is sublime, self-satisfied and proud but increasingly caught in bewilderment and anxiousness. Perfectly balanced by Alicia Vikander, who somehow always seems to be one step ahead, mysterious, dark and sexy.Yet somehow Gawain pushes on, victim to his own desires, pulling the viewer along on his journey into an ever-increasing turmoil of magic, emotion and fate.I thoroughly enjoyed this film!",The Green Knight

Second watch I loved how well crafted and multi-faceted it was. Third watch confirmed my love. Truly a great film for those that enjoy beautiful cinematography and metaphor that isn't so obscure to keep the themes hidden.,The Green Knight
1500,emox-22019,Don't waste your time,1,24 September 2021,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. If you feel like wasting 2+ hours of your life waiting for any type of excitement to come, but it never does and you're happy being disappointed. Well you're in luck, this movie is for you! The plot makes almost no sense, the acting is horrid, and the production value doesn't exist.",The Green Knight
1501,jakeaustermann,Extremely Solid,8,2 August 2021,"The movie was extremely well done, it felt more like I was reading a fantasy story than it did watching a fantasy movie.I'd highly recommend it to friends to see in theaters and would probably even go to see it again, but it doesn't have much at-home replay value for me.",The Green Knight
1502,sakiskarpas,To the Negative Reviewers: Stick to Super Hero Movies ffs!,9,21 August 2021,"The Green Knight is a diamond and definitely the best movie I saw this year. It's not a movie I would recommend to everyone. It has a slow-burning structure, its rhythm fluctuates and those who expect action, battles and blood, will be bitterly disappointed. It is a dark tale, of special aesthetics, with a theatrical, almost poetic, hue that praises Shakespeare and the Arthurian Circle. So, those of you who enjoy this kind of spectacle, will love the journey of David Lowery.",The Green Knight
1503,ayaaahmed-71016,So do people hate this movie so much because it's not faithful to the original poem?,6,30 August 2021,"I don't find this movie to be as awful as people make it seem like. I had high expectations for this one and yes I felt let down a little, but I didn't hate it. In fact I might even watch it again.",The Green Knight
1504,kcchiefsfan-58715,Green Knight: Colossal waste of time,1,4 August 2021,"For starters, the trailer was very eye catching, stimulating, and gave an aura of adventure. My anticipation was sprung through the roof along with many other fools. Stepping into the theater, I had read the book and had very high expectations. Little did I know this movie was a roller coaster bound straight for an abyss of mindless watching. If you wish to feel uncomfortable, uneasy, and utterly and completely lost of all train of thought, then see this movie ASAP. Never before had I seen such weak character development in the beginning and throughout the rest of the film. Every scene was unique in that it left you feeling awkward in a new way. The entire 2 hours and 10 minutes of the movie was filled with around 500 words and 2 hours of high pitched choir women singing at the top of their lungs. Every scene was accompanied with the same music, no matter the context of the scene. If there was any hint of a deeper meaning, it was not explained nor did we care 1 hour into the movie. The movie experience was like you got told a joke by your weird uncle and then never received the punchline. The only reason I stayed was because I thought there would be something to it it all together and because of the $5 that I paid for my ticket. Thank the Lord it was cheap ticket Tuesday. I would consider it an injustice for any poor soul who watches the movie in its entirety. The best part of the movie was seeing the previews before of the exciting movies that awaited me in the future. If I had to sum up this movie in three words, I would say..... breathing, beefed-up-Groot, and blindfolded-voodoo-grandma. Do your friends and family a service and tell them to see Jungle Cruise instead. That's all.",The Green Knight
1505,mj-58602,Really really bad,2,14 September 2021,Makes no sense. Terrible pointless story. No direction.,The Green Knight
1506,dostalg,Please... Save your money!,1,1 August 2021,Easily the worst movie I have seen. So incredibly boring and pointless.,The Green Knight
1507,ilyasshaji,PATHETIC MOVIE,1,13 September 2021,I didn't know why these people rated this movie above 5. One of the worst movie ever watched only notable thing is that the actor who played as protagonist is from indian orgin.,The Green Knight
1508,chrisdixon1982,"Boring, a complete waste of time and effort.",2,2 October 2021,"I'd been looking forward to a movie like this for a while as I'm a fan of the King Auther folk law. There have been good and bad movies in the past but nothing for a while. Here we had an opportunity to use some fresh blood, fresh writing and really good actors. The actors did their very best and cannot be blamed for what can be described as paint drying on your screen. It doesn't start well with the initial dialogue of some kind of prophecy being an indecipherable gargle which is supposed to set up the film. It just gets worse after that with characters you don't care about not doing a great deal. King Arthur's nephew finding himself and his strength, not that you care by the end. It's the director showing he can do an arty film. Don't waste your time what a shame.",The Green Knight
