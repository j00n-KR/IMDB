0,Sleepin_Dragon,An awful movie.,3,8 November 2021,"I walked out of the cinema absolutely and totally disappointed. I was bored and frustrated by this movie, the biggest disappointment of 2021. It seemed to last forever, it was slow, lifeless, and jumped about in the most frustrating manner.I felt like the cast shared absolutely no chemistry, this featured some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I loved how they always looked pristine after a fight scene, that sums this movie up, all about looks, zero thought to the actual content.The effects are a mix of good and bad, considering the budget it should have looked much sharper, the celestials did look great though.So many wasted opportunities, why on earth did they not explore the relationship between The Eternals more so, that was the biggest frustration.Several scenes had the whole cinema groaning.Avoid, 3/10.",Eternals
1,CinemaSerf,"Yes, you can have too many resources for a film...",6,8 November 2021,"The premiss here is quite fun - 7,000 years ago a diverse race of immortals arrive on Earth to protect the population from a monstrous race of ""Deviants"" who are bent on eating us all up. Their ""Prime Directive"", if you will, is that they must not interfere in human conflict, so once they have cleared away the beasties, they split up and lead separate lives. That is, until ""Sersi"" (Gemma Chan), her pal ""Sprite"" (Lia McHugh) and her beau ""Dane"" (Kit Harrington) are set upon in London by a newly empowered creature only to be rescued by ""Ikaris"" (Richard Madden) - and that incident forces them all to reassemble. Pretty soon they discover the body of their erstwhile leader ""Ajak"" (Selma Hayek) and must now combine their forces to thwart their ever strengthening enemy and learn why they have resurfaced. Unfortunately, what now follows is a stunning looking, but really pretty dull series of set-piece scenarios that rather clunkily combine mythology and melodrama, romance and action. The camera loves Madden, but as an actor - even clad in blue leather - he is little better than a handsome man. Kumail Nanjiani (""KIngo"") has a soupçon of charisma, but the rest of the cast including the really out of place Angelina Jolie (""Thena"") and Harish Patel (""Karun"") who is intent on videoing everthing at considerable risk to himself, really offer little by way of characterisation and the attempts at humour misfire most of the time. The story has some great effects, but so what? That's what we expect from the most mediocre of productions nowadays. What was needed here were far fewer actors and a much more robust story - and, yes, it could probably have lost the half an hour spent justifying the enormous budget in far-lung locations (real and imaginary). There's a final scene midway through the credits that really does not bode well for the sequel either. I was really pretty bored with this film and though undoubtedly a colourful, action-packed big screen experience, it is an entirely forgettable film to watch.",Eternals
2,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,It's hard to overstate how amazing this is,8,5 November 2021,"For 7000 years, 10 aliens have lived among us. Their powers are immense. They are here to protect us from the Deviants, apex predators who we could never defeat on our own. However, their makers, the Celestials, have ordered them not to interfere with our development. After The Snap, something is different, and they may have to go against what they have been told.So, this is a lot to take in. Which is why the movie opens with a text crawl, and a lot of it is characters talking, discussing. I understand why some people feel that this bogs the movie down, that the pacing is lethargic. With that said, I simply cannot agree with them. This is never less than deeply compelling. Chloe Zhao embodies what Roger Ebert(RIP) meant, when he referred to films(as a medium) as ""empathy machines"". It is astonishing that she manages to find humanity(and so much, at that) in all of these super beings, who should be completely impossible to relate to, for any audience member(vampires don't *actually* exist, right?).The MCU is maturing. This is easily the most philosophical, downright existential, entry in the over two dozen series(which, just to be clear, I'm a huge fan of, have been from the very start). Smartly, it is very friendly to newcomers, and you really do not need to have watched any of the others in order to follow this. It makes you think, feel, and stays with you long after the two incredible post credit scenes have played. Honestly, a number of people will be moved to tears by the relationships depicted in this. I came quite close, myself. The diversity in casting, in languages spoken(and signed), all the civilizations and ethnicities shown, underlining that we humans are all one race, our world and problems the same. The sheer fact that this doesn't come across as cheesy and preachy is deeply impressive. This features beautiful cinematography, location shooting and every action scene is emotionally engaging in addition to exciting and cool looking.There is a lot of violence, much of it against creatures, a little moderate to strong language and brief sexuality in this. I recommend this to everyone over the age of 13. 8/10.",Eternals
3,neil-476,Epic but unemotional,7,6 November 2021,"EternalsSo there are Celestials, God-like beings. Arishem, one of them, allocates a bunch of Eternals (fairly God-like but not quite) to Earth, 7,000 years ago, to protect mankind from Deviants (unexplained monsters). This is their only job: they are not to interfere in human affairs. They wipe the Deviants out and then go their seperate ways, waiting to be recalled to their home planet. Then a Deviant appears...I enjoyed this and the eye candy is splendid, the action is beautifully choreographed. But it is one of the weaker offerings, and here is why.There are too many new characters and you don't get the chance to know them. This means you don't get emotionally invested in them. Yes, you care about whether xyz global crisis happens, but you don't really care about the relationships between the Eternals. A number of character-based subplots are introduced but never really go anywhere. The thing about the MCU is that you got to genuinely care about each character, which is why the deaths in Avengers 3 and 4 were so devastating. That is not the case here.Also, it is longer than it needs to be, to no purpose, and although the story is simple, it is unnecessarily complicated in the telling.Again, I enjoyed it, but it is probably 2nd or 3rd from the bottom of my list. It is competently - skilfully, even - assembled, but it has little heart.",Eternals
4,FeastMode,i'm so sad,4,5 November 2021,"I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn't. It wasn't even good. I'm legitimately sad while writing this.I see this as the MCU homage to Watchmen. It feels very ""adult"" in so many ways. But in others, it's childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless side plots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn't feel natural, something always feels a bit off.There's a lot i enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I've ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn't. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi. The deep philosophical themes were interesting but poorly executed.Sigh. I'll probably watch it again to see if it grows on me. But this might be the worst MCU movie. (1 viewing, opening night 11/4/2021)",Eternals
5,ThomasDrufke,Brilliantly Different Film for the MCU,8,5 November 2021,"A vastly different entry into the MCU but one that took me for a ride. It's impressive feat to take on a 10 lead character based film, it's another thing to make you care about every single one of them. Chloe Zhao has already shown us her talent with smaller films, and it's even more telling on a massive MCU scale that she's here to stay. It's hard to say what the best 2021 MCU film is at this point but Eternals has certainly made it's stamp on me. I had a blast.8.8/10.",Eternals
6,Edvis-1997,6,6,9 November 2021,"I've decided to watch it not because I wanted just because my friend invited to go together. Well, it wasn't amazing, I wasn't surprised in any good way, it was just an average movie with some great but also some awful special effects. The main idea was really bad, plot was very messy and hard to fallow, even The legend of.... was better movie, this one was one of the worst Marvel's movie so far.",Eternals
7,UniqueParticle,Well I loved it,9,10 November 2021,"I'm not sure why Eternals got bashed I understood Black Widow hate more. This was so good cinematically especially in IMAX, acting was astonishing, and colors were all glorious! The story might be the only bumpy aspect even that I enjoyed for a Marvel film it's really solid even deserves rewards definitely had a lot of Chloe Zhao vibes that reminded me of Nomadland. I loved Eternals I'd highly recommend despite anything I think it's worth it!Side note:There was a hot mom in the audience that was a bonus though.",Eternals
8,Thanos_Alfie,Different but interesting...,7,5 November 2021,"""Eternals"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch the start of a new saga of Marvel. The Eternals are a group of immortal beings living on Earth, helping people throughout its whole history and through all civilizations.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie since I have watched all the previous Marvel movies. A new era starts with this movie and we all have to be patient about it because time is needed for it to grow. Plenty of information came up and answered some of our questions regarding the Eternals and their purpose. ""Eternals"" surprised me since it was very different from what I expected but it was also interesting so, I am expecting the way that will continue it and what else it's going to present to us. The direction which was made by Chloé Zhao was good and she presented very well the main story behind Eternals but of course there is more information that needs to be presented. The interpretations of Gemma Chan who played as Sersi, Barry Keoghan who played as Druig, Lauren Ridloff who played as Makkari and Richard Madden who played as Icarus were very good. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Eternals"" is a nice movie as a start of a new era but we expect more from it in the future.",Eternals
9,cruise01,Beautiful scope and visuals leading Marvel to a new direction.,8,6 November 2021,"4 out of 5 stars.Eternals is beautifully stunning when it comes to a cinematic superhero film which director Chloe Zhao does well in capturing fantastic settings and scope. The film is way different comparing it to other marvel films. Zhao is aiming high for more of a compelling dramatic tension with the characters and great cinematography shots. And visual effects. The film does struggle with its pacing which can make it feel a little slow.What worked?The plot is great. The story gets bigger in the mcu. Showing Eternals which are immortal beings that have lived for 5000 years. Living among humans. While there agenda is protecting humans from deviants. There is more to the plot which gives it a twist about the Eternals hidden agenda. And a third act twist which a villain rises and divides and fights against the eternals. The idea of a celestial being born and needing to demolish worlds is an epic and thrilling direction.The cast ensemble is huge and all worked great with there characters. Gemma Chan did great as Sersei. Richard Madden is great. Along with Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, and Kit Harrington. In the movie, the Eternals did a great job working as a team. Every character stood out. Jolie and Ridloff were awesome. Kit Harrington has a small brief role. There is a seed planted for a much bigger part for him in the mcu world.The cinematography, music score, production settings, and visual effects are all great and worth watching. It does feel like watching a big budget artsy film with a superhero theme. The film does have a long epic run time which gives it enough time for it to develop the characters. Lots of flash backs through the centuries. While they try to find each other on Earth. The film spends most of the time with Ikaris and Sersei trying to locate the other Eternals on Earth. So they can preparing for an upcoming doom.The action sequences were good. Chloe Zhao played it too safe and avoided overdoing it which makes the movie feeling a little quieter compared to other mcu movies. A few good action scenes. And a climatic fight trying to slow the villain down to save the world.What did not work?Eternals is slow moving with its pacing. It does have a pacing issue which sets up for an exciting adventure and a epic showdown. It gets slowed down with too many expositions with the characters that the script slows down.Overall, Eternals is epic, it is beautifully shot and done with a great cast ensemble, and a story that is taking mcu to a direction that has yet to be explored. Even with the slow pacing, it is still one enjoyable ride.There are two credit scenes, one mid credit which introduces a new character, and a post credit scene which hints for a characters fate for future movies.",Eternals
10,eddie_baggins,A Marvel film that doesn't always feel like one,7,7 November 2021,"Oscar winning indie darling Chloé Zhao has had quite the directing career in the span of six years since her debut Songs My Brothers Taught Me first released in 2015, with the Chinese born filmmaker moving onto the critically acclaimed The Rider, the award sweeping Nomadland and now in one of the biggest career trajectory leaps I can recall in recent memory, the newest Marvel franchise starter Eternals.A comic book film that never really feels like a comic book film and one that doesn't pander too the typical Marvel formula that the company and its owners Disney have played too so successfully over the last decade, Eternals allows Zhao too bring her independent nuances to a narrative with a $200 million dollar plus budget, one that is full to the brim with ideas, characters and possibilities, that whilst not always adding up to a completely satisfactory whole, combine to ensure that Marvel's big risk can still be regarded as a success, flaws and all.A fairly well-known property amongst the Marvel comic community, Eternals isn't exactly a name brand entity in the wider film going landscape and Zhao has a lot of ground to cover across her two and half hour plus feature that at times struggles with the weight of various timelines, character movements and narrative devices, to ensure that audiences get up to speed with their Deviants, Celestials and all the ensemble of the Eternal gang but despite the film dragging through certain stretches of its running time and not always giving sufficient time to its cast (Angelina Jolie's troubled Thena and Lauren Ridloff's deaf Makkari springing to mind), Eternals is an often beautifully shot film and one that can be commended for trying to reach for the stars.As she's shown across her short but noteworthy career so far, Zhao is a great director of actors and knows how to explore her characters (often in Terrence Malick like visual storytelling) in ways that inspire thought provoking and heartfelt feelings, with rising star Gemma Chan doing well as the kindhearted Sersi, Richard Madden doing his best work outside of Game of Thrones as Ikaris and Barry Keoghan having a blast as the intriguing mind controller Druig, with all performers working well alongside Zhao to give Eternals something more than pretty visuals and big narrative moments, even if Harish Patel's scene-stealing chauffer Karun may be audiences real MVP.With so much going on and so many characters too juggle along the way, the film plays out in a way that isn't going to be as predictable and stereotypical of what Marvel has built in the years past, with those seeking endless barrages of action scenes and a big city destroying battle finale likely to be left feeling relatively empty by the way Eternals presses forward onto its endgame, changing up the pace in a neat way that while not placing Eternals up too be regarded as one of Marvel's finest moments, at least places it well and truly in the top-tier of their feature catalogue when it comes to offering up something slightly different and far more risky than what has come in the past.It nothing else, Eternals shows that Marvel are not content in allowing their tentpole pictures to become stale and worn out, a good thing for all at days end.Final Say -A big film that doesn't always manage to balance out its many moving parts and ideas, Eternals is nonetheless another entertaining piece of the Marvel puzzle that tries to give audiences something different from a brand that has become synonymous with comfort food blockbusters.3 1/2 Stark family reunions out of 5.",Eternals
11,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Marvel's New Superhero Saga Is Visually Splendid But Lacks Standard Values and Pacing. Certainly, The Weakest Marvel Film Recently.",5,3 November 2021,"Eternals (2021) :
Movie Review -Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it.MCU's recent projects have done great without theatrical release and notably, those came after 'Endgame'. 'Black Widow' and fresh fruit 'Shang Chi' earned back box office glory for them. I would have been happy to see them trying something nee after Endgan though. Something like what DC did with 'Joker'. Eternals does not depend on any such backdrop, it's a standalone product and maybe that's it will take some more time to create fan following. In the film, the Eternals, an immortal alien race, emerge from hiding after thousands of years to protect Earth from their evil counterparts, the Deviants. The screenplay here is not confusing at all but it is terribly slow. Marvel's Filmmaking may take a new turn from here as they have tried something calm this time, unlike super explosive narratives we saw in previous films. However, they couldn't try out something completely different from the trademark they carry which makes this film highly predictable.The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely not flawless but it isn't lame either. Creating a new universe for old fans might have put extra burden and that can be noticed in the film. It has those typical jokes carrying childish humour which you have left behind, 15 years ago. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. It slows down the vehicle anyway, almost to the level when you feel like having a little nap without taking those glasses off.Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. However, the performances aren't that great. Some characters don't even make any sense considering the kind of powers they have. Somewhere, the writing is also responsible for that. Indian fans, please do not melt when you see Indian faces but please laugh when they crack hilarious one-liners. Visually, Eternals is splendid. The IMAX experience makes it truly wonderful and appealing. Marvel's VFX team has provided them a much needed boost here.No doubts, the whole thing is long. Sometimes it feels like, is it gonna take MCU's Phase Five to reach the End? That eternal longing certainly hurts the film but rest assured, it's a standard Marvel Film. Chloé Zhao puts all the elements demanded by Marvel Fans while she deliberately ignores unnecessary dramatic scenes. Was she driving towards daily-soap pulp? I think yes. This is 2021 and you are still using 2011 cliches to add some gags in the film? Seriously? I mean the film is made only for new kids or what? Let the fans decide that. They don't care much about content anyways because if they had, Marvel would have moved on from money-spinners to classic cinema long time ago. Nevertheless, Eternals is a grand visual treat which deserves to be watched only and only in 3D. Yes, Marvel Fans can flock into theatres to scream out for the new superheroes this Diwali while others can skip it for their own good.RATING - 5/10*",Eternals
12,subxerogravity,It is a satisfying movie.,7,5 November 2021,"I am still waiting for that X-Men movie man.Not too familiar with the Eternals, which is why going into this I was thinking they were like mutants, the same way the Inhumans are like humans. With that said, like the Inhumans, the Eternals cannot beat what Charles Xavier and his misfit crew put together.The Eternals do try too hard to stand-alone. I am looking for a lot of references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I did not get enough for my taste at all. Realistically, this is why I go to the theatre to see these movies.As a standalone, movie it was not half bad. It had a fantasy like story with many cool characters played by good actors. I did like how complex a lot of the characters were. I felt that the Eternals moved away a lot from the superhero genre, nothing in the movie is as cut and dry as most of these Superhero movies are when it comes to the main characters being heroes.Because of this, once again a marvel movie is missing a good villain. They could have used one. As cool, as the characters are they did a lot of talking. Some of the characters like Kingo and Phastos were interesting enough to want to hear their story. I wish this held true for everyone, but it did not. Plus, all the talking made for too many moments where I forgot what the purpose of their mission is.I am impressed with the visuals, especially the Celestials (who keep changing with every movie they appear in, right?). They were impressively big seeing them on the big screen. I do not know if this was Chole Zhao's first rodeo when it comes to special effects but she definitely did not fall intio the same mistakes that the Russo brothers and Ryan Coolger mad on their first marvel movie outing.That is about it, however. It was not enough of a marvel movie to watch it on the big screen like the others with other people as into it as I am (cause no one else seem to be). I'm glad I saw it on the big screen cause the visuals were impressive but we are getting to the point in which I don't know who these marvel superheroes are and its changing my interest (Although in fairness I had no idea who the Guardians of the Galaxy where before seeing the movie and they won me over far better).",Eternals
13,DarkVulcan29,"Not Marvels best, but certainly not the worst.",7,7 November 2021,"I heard so many bad reviews about this movie, but didn't watch any of them cause I was worried I be influenced by them, so I decided to give this the benefit of the doubt. I was eager to see a new installment in the marvel universe.What works are the effects, really jump out at you, and never feel over used, and some humorous moments are pretty funny. But what doesn't work is most of the characters don't really click to the point you feel they have a history with each other.. Some of the acting here is very dry, Angelina Jolie gets a mixed bag, some moments in the film she looks bored and sleepwalking, and other moments she's really giving her all. But I am eager to see where the story goes after this.",Eternals
14,stevendbeard,Enjoyable But Not The Greatest,8,6 November 2021,"I saw ""Eternals"", starring Gemma Chan-Captain Marvel, Crazy Rich Asians; Richard Madden-Rocketman, Game of Thrones_tv; Kumail Nanjiani-Stuber, Central Intelligence; Angelina Jolie-the Maleficent movies, Wanted and Salma Hayek-Like A Boss, Everly.This is a super hero movie that is based on some comic books created by Jack Kirby. It's been a while since I have read the original books but the premise goes something like this; The Celestials are space gods that are responsible for creating universes. The Eternals are super powered protectors of the Earth-sent by the Celestials-that fight the evil creatures called Deviants. Each Eternal has a different power and they are immortal. Salma/Ajak is their leader and other members include Gemma/Sersi, Richard/Ikaris, Kumail/Kingo and Angelina/Thena. The Eternals and the Deviants had a big battle some 7,000 years ago and the Eternals were victorious. The weary warriors went their separate ways and lived among the humans, gently influencing the humans' progress in technology-remember, being immortal, they don't age. In the present, the Deviants pop up again and the battles are once more joined. There are secrets that are uncovered-mostly about the Eternals real mission-and there is a tease of a future hero. There are 2 scenes at the end; just as the credits start-a relative of Thanos shows up-and after the end credits is the tease of a future hero in the next Eternals movie.It's rated ""PG-13"" for fantasy violence, action, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 37 minutes.It's not the greatest super hero movie-they are laying the ground work for future movies-but it was enjoyable. I would buy it on DVD.",Eternals
15,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Eternals,8,8 November 2021,"8/10 - while it's true that this film boasts a long runtime and does have a lot of characters (but certainly focuses on a few key ones), Chloé Zhao and her team did a fantastic job in bringing a nice breath of fresh air to the MCU with this mature, adult-driven superhero film that is the best of Disney's offerings since Avengers: Endgame.",Eternals
16,alindsay-al,A Good Film that introduces a new side of The MCU,7,8 November 2021,"After what feels like forever, Marvel Studios newest characters The Eternals have come to the big screen and I have watched the film today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film documents the story of thousand year old powered individuals and their fight against their sworn enemies The Deviants.Main Character
Gemma Chan plays Sersi and she is the main character here and she is fine. Chan does an effective job in the role and she is just a decent character. She is by no means the best Marvel lead protagonist but considering this is a real ensemble cast she fits in very effectively. Richard Madden plays Ikaris and I thought he was great, it took me time to get on board with his character but he really starts to thrive as the film progresses and you learn more about him and his motivations makes him stand out from the rest of The Eternals.Supporting Characters
Angelina Jolie plays Thena and I thought she was effective here. She is basically the films Wonder Woman and thus has some good action scenes but she has an interesting character that is somewhat developed and obviously Jolie can pull this off well. Kumail Nanjiani and Brian Tyree Henry are more of the comic relief and they are really good at it and they are just fun additions to the cast. Lauren Ridloff is really good too and she is really important as the first deaf actress to play a superhero and it feels like an important moment here. Barry Keoghan as Druig is a really effective character, he plays it really well and I really liked the twists and turns that were given to his character. Salma Hayek & Kit Harrington are also good in their smaller roles here and I kind of wish we could have spent more time with Harrington in particular.Story
The individual stories for each member of The Eternals are well done, Ikaris, Thena and Druig in particular have really good arcs and make them interesting characters. The whole romance dynamic between Ikaris and Sersi is also really well done too and made it a romance that I actually cared about in The MCU. It has nuance in its storytelling and the motivations of different groups and people is well handled and made me care. But this film has a few too many characters in it and it does slow down the story telling, I also thought the whole ending sequence was a bit lacklustre and fails to deliver completely on the epic levels it should have.Script
The script has some chuckle worthy moments and some complexity too it when it comes to a few of its characters. But it falls short of doing enough to really make you care about the overall situation, it seems so large scale but at times the dialogue is rigid and it digs its heels in, especially in the past scenes.Style
The film looks brilliant. The CGI is breathtaking and the action scenes are fantastically made and flow incredibly well. The film is 2 and a half hours and it didn't feel too long for me and it felt like an appropriate length. But the pacing of the film gets let down due to its editing of the plot, it jumps all over time periods and it feels very choppy which did make the film feel disjointed with its feeling.Overall
Overall, Eternals is a good film. It has a hard job of introducing so many new characters and story elements to an established universe, it has issues but overall I saw this as a pretty positive experience.",Eternals
17,masonsaul,Refreshingly different,8,7 November 2021,"Eternals has a few problems, it's biggest being a pointless villain, but it's so refreshingly different to the rest of the MCU that it's still a great movie with stunning visuals, impressive emotional heft and humour that rarely undercuts the emotional weight.Gemma Chan gives an incredible lead performance and Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani and Ma Dong-seok are all also incredible. Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff and Barry Keoghan are all great, if a little underutilized.Chloé Zhao's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed and definitely one of the most visually stunning films in the MCU. The CG is mostly impressive but has quite a few weak moments. The music by Ramin Djawadi is really good.",Eternals
18,rgkarim,This Film Will Eternally Be Known As The Marvel Diverging Point,7,5 November 2021,"LIKES:The Comedy:
For once, the comedy is not the strongest element in a Marvel movie, not forcing too many jokes or elements to offset the direction this film took. However, it does not mean the movie does not have its comedic moments and I enjoyed a few good quips and running jokes that Zhao and her team wrote into the story. Kumail Nanjiani's blunt styles work well in this film at times and when bounced off of other characters sells the joke to much better levels. Brian Tyree Henry's sarcasm is right on point, utilizing emotion and comedic timing to great levels in order to get a good drive out and perhaps a little personality to his character. The winner of comedy though is Harish Patel whose role is simple, but works phenomenally in an Indian Buddy Hackett sort of way that was natural, fun, and relieved the darker moments of the movie. Again, it's not the wettest comedy, but it works.The New Direction at Times:
Eternals is delivering on the promise of being an alternative approach to the superhero film and trying to expand into artistic realms. Using a character focused role, Eternals removes the kid friendly filter to degrees to make a grittier Marvel film (aside from Deadpool and X-men) that starts to bare the mature teeth a little more. The movie is darker, addressing philosophical concepts about life, and converting it into a deeper story past the usual bad vs. Good guys. It works on levels and tries to keep you on your toes for the future of our heroes and this makes for a more intriguing concept than the usual predictable runs. The mature tone means caution in younger audience members, but it succeeds in adding new approaches to diversify the future of the series.The Action, Sometimes:
I won't say the action is the most exciting, but Eternals sort of takes the approach of the Netflix shows, where the realism sets in and the danger is real. This approach leads to more suspense at what the character's limits are, while also offering some more strategic warfare required to execute the Deviants. If you are a fan of seeing this style and dropping the 'theatrics"", then you'll be happy to see the magic toned in a different direction, trying to evolve the battles and the circumstances with it.The Story, to a part:
We know Zhao likes character building pieces and Eternals shows this in the presentation as a character piece over anything else. Mass integration of these personalities came to light and just how many elements each of these character had. Relationships are semi-dynamic amidst the team, and in this one movie explored a bit into many of them at what their approach to their mission was. It's some of these elements that again open the ""originality"" of this film in the universe and allows you to get some time exploring a potential favorite character past the usual splendor.The Cinematography:
While the special effects may be a little limited at times, the actual cinematography is well-done and deserving of applause from this reviewer. Elements from Dune leaked into this movie, with the scale of size differences really standing out. Emotional moments have great angles, the lighting and shading work super well to promote that darker atmosphere. Setting and sequences hold dynamic moments, and all the preparation sort of sells the feelings of the moment as they journey across the Earth searching for the keys to success. I think this may be the strongest element of storytelling to be honest, and seeing all these elements come together really helped set the scenes apart. A nice job on using the elements of NomadLand to this part of the Marvel Universe as it was very impressive for me.The Character Usage:
You know me and my obsession with using the characters to significant amounts for their inclusion in the big moments. Eternals had a lot of pressure for at least 10 characters to portray and for much of the film, they achieved that goal. Each of our gods contributes in meaningful ways for me, playing their part and progressing the story to qualify for being mentioned. Some of them are big on character centric moments and moral challenging questions. Others are the action elements who exist to give awesome fights as the tools to fight the Deviants. Several are comedic relief and the humanizing element of the film, trying to bring the superhero element back down to help with the struggles our cast faces. And others are indeed the combining glue of the movie and, with it, tie everything together in a rather cohesive package.DISLIKES:The Story Incompleteness:
Eternals new direction has promise, but it can't quite get all it wanted done in the 2.5 hours it had. Zhao is big on diving into her characters' stories and though she manages to touch on the elements and deliver enough of the punch needed to get the point across. However, several of these stories don't feel fully fleshed out, elements that are lacking build up and complete layouts at times feels rushed and blunt at times. This continues to occur over the course of the movie, with an ending that really has crammed elements and is deprived of the extra factor I like in my climactic endings. Certainly there are some theatrics, but a lot of things sort of crash together to wrap things up towards the finale.The Deviants:
A major element of this movie is the mystery of the aliens that serve the rivals to the Eternals in this cosmic game of chess. While the design is not bad, the utilization of these creatures and the mystery behind them is kind of blown over and misused on many levels. Really cool concepts get some great starts, but then drop flat, and near the end of the movie are nearly forgotten until BAM you are hit with the elements in a rapid manner. It's not that it wasn't cool at times, in fact it has the coolest move of the movie, but it's shoehorned in and lost to the giant scheme of the movie.The Action Scenes:
While there are some awesome fights to show off the power of teamwork, they also feel a bit shorthanded in the grand scheme of the movie. Many of the early fights are very quick, lasting only about three minutes before petering them out, while others are even shorter and limit the teamwork dynamic I like. Other times, the realism sort of gets in the way of the choreography I love, and I feel the punches were pulled to keep that darker element going to stick the artistic vision Zhao went for. Again, I don't hate the action sequences and find some moments I love, but the level of quality feels inconsistent like much of the movie. Even Thena's climactic fight holds some underwhelming moments, and given how much rode on it, that's not the best finale for me.The Pacing:
The biggest part about the movie that I feel was kind of the weakest element was the pacing in this movie. Eternals is not the slowest movie, but it's inconsistent for me as I watched things unfold. Flashbacks to past and then present are at times fun to see as they try to strategically give you information about how the Eternals got where they were going. However, other times, it just robs the movie of the momentum and could have been used in a different manner to really maximize everything in the film. It bled into the action moments for me, it led to uneven moments mentioned earlier, and I sort of feel resulted in the limited use of the Deviants as described. Zhao's artistic style was indeed a bold move, but I think she needed more time to really execute everything to the perfect level.The VERDICT:
Eternals was a bold direction and opens up for a much broader galaxy and artistic approach to offset the monotony of the Marvel series. Zhao's character centered story approach works for this movie, with all ten characters getting adequate screen time and involvement, as they attempt to take hold in your hearts and memory. It's got layers to the characters, with fantastic exploration of life's philosophy, and mapping out these heroes in manners that feel like a Greek Tragedy. Visual wise, the movie is astonishing in scale and spectrum, helping to really convey emotions and maximize all the disdain of the scenes. And the fact that there is a balance of comedy to not offset this mature direction gets points in my book for following the rules and not getting lost in the popular formula. However, the movie's new approach is not going to be for everyone, especially given how inconsistent it was for me at times and how much it bled into other components. The story has a lot of rushed and crammed elements, not enough to not complete the story, but sort of robbing the film of that full finish she can do. It's ties to the MCU are very limited, and the new path it sets offers the chance for new openings, but is a bit disappointing for those who look for all the connections they can instead of a new pathway to get lost in. For me though, the pacing is the weakest part of the film and it's cascade on the other parts of the movie are the undermining factors. Realistic action sometimes gets bogged down by shoehorned ideas, certain plot elements are lost and then quickly summed up, and the full on exploration of the characters still require more time and perhaps another movie to tell the full story she wanted. Still, not a bad entry into the universe and I will gran this film:Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.",Eternals
19,mhorg2018,Another So-So Entry for Marvel,5,5 November 2021,"First, to those who complained about the acting/cast, I guess we weren't watching the same movie, because that's the highlight of this film. Everyone put in a good performance. BUT... as I said, that's the highlight.The story... well, The Eternals, created by Kirby or not, never were a big drawer in the marvel universe. So why choose them for a movie? They're really just a sideshow. They never lasted long. At least not as long as this movie felt. The director did a good job, but the pacing was horrible and the movie felt like it was five hours long. Especially the middle where things just go sooooooo sloooow. Another major problem is Kit Harrington is wasted. He's in the movie for maybe ten minutes. And they never really make clear that he is supposed to be/become the Black Knight. This main celestial, if he's so powerful, why can't he just create other celestials rather than drop them on planets that are then destroyed? Are we now going to see the island celestial in every single marvel movie? Or have it mentioned? So far this year, marvel is 0-4 with me. Eternals, Shang-Chi, Venom, Black Widow. All movies I don't care if I never see again (and in Venom's case, won't see again.) Are they a victim of their own success? I notice from the below 7 rating on IMDB, that not even the Marvel Drones are saving this one.",Eternals
20,nancyldraper,Love it or hate it,8,5 November 2021,"The reaction to this movie has been a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" outcry. I think the dividing line of responses is whether or not it fits the Marvel mega-action template and if that is okay or not. Just to deal with that question out of the gate, this does not fit the Marvel cookie cutter. There are a variety of differences. It is diverse in both casting and subject matter. The cast is international, multinational and multi-ethnic. We have our first openly gay superhero. We have our first hero who is deaf. We have our first hero to struggles with their mental health. All artfully and beautifully presented, in my opinion. This is not a single character's origin story. It is 10 characters' origin story spanning over 7,000 years, plus the introduction of 3 distinct and new species: Celestials, Eternals and Deviants. It also acknowledges superheroes from other universes, like the potshots at DC's Superman. There are also some Marvel staple components, humour, brilliant CGI, fight scenes and world weaving. This film is also beautiful, in its casting, cinematography, graphics and music. The story is rich and the immense timeline is artfully woven into small bites. There is also a deeper treatment of relationships and some mature but tasteful scenes. The draw for me was Marvel and the stellar cast, especially Gemma Chan, whose career I've been following for a long time, now (do yourself a favour and binge her filmography). I have to confess that when I left the theatre I wasn't sure how I felt about the movie. Then, I heard Rotten Tomatoes gave it the lowest of all ratings for a Marvel movie (49%) and the critics who saw early releases were brutal. But, I also read the positive reviews by ordinary theatre goers and in writing this, I've decided to give this film an 8 (great) out of 10 and, personally, I look forward to seeing it again. {Superhero Action Adventure}",Eternals
21,Jeremy_Urquhart,Wish it had been better,6,6 November 2021,"I was surprised when all the mixed reviews for Eternals started coming in. It had a good cast, an interesting premise, and of course was directed by Chloe Zhao, so I (and presumably many others) had hopes it could be something really good, and a breath of fresh air in the MCU.Having now seen it, I think the somewhat unenthusiastic critical reception is less because the movie's terrible, but more because it's disappointing. It ends up less than the sum of its parts, because most of the cast is solid, some visuals are really good, Zhao's style does shine through on occasion, and the music is overall quite good. Humour is a mixed bag but a good deal does work.The only thing that's pretty bad is the action- it's either the Eternals fighting big CGI monsters, or magical beings throwing magic at each other. It's just not exciting, especially when that's all you get action-wise, and so many of those scenes are shot in dimly lit, murky environments.Pacing is a mixed bag. The slower rhythm of the film works for a good deal of its runtime, but the last 45-60 minute drags like crazy. And it's not helped by the climax being so boring- I didn't used to have a problem with the frequently criticised ""over the top MCU third act CGI-fest"", but it's been very noticeable in all of Marvel's 2021 theatrical releases so far. They need to start doing a better job at ending their films.Writing wise, it may have helped to have at least some slight introduction to some of the characters in this in an earlier movie, or else had one main character really focused on. Jumping into such a big ensemble and developing them all in just one movie doesn't really work, and neither do the villains either, in the end (what little antagonists we get).As a stand-alone movie, it's not great, but it's worth giving some benefit of the doubt that things introduced here will have satisfying pay-offs down the line. Phase 4 of the MCU needs a direction to go in, or to build to, and Eternals may have given us a hint of that.There are a number of parts of this film that work, and it's only the action and some of the pacing that I'd call actually bad. But it is a disappointment, for sure.",Eternals
22,Anurag-Shetty,"Doesn't deserve the negative reviews & firmly in the middle, among all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.",10,5 November 2021,"Eternals is based on the Jack Kirby comic book of the same name. It tells the story of the Eternals who are extremely powerful & immortal entities. The Eternals have lived on Earth for thousands of years & have been present for many of its historic moments.Eternals is a mind-blowing film. Director Chloe Zhao has brought her flair for breathtaking visuals, to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cinematography by Ben Davis is absolutely gorgeous. What's super impressive is that all the locations in the movie are real & not green/blue screen, which is usually Marvel's modus operandi. The action set pieces are excellent. The visual effects are superb. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The camerawork in some scenes are a bit too dark for my liking. The Deviants are quite unremarkable as villains. Also, there are some minor inconsistencies in the storyline, and there is not too much humor compared to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, this film doesn't deserve to be the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first rotten-rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes. Zhao has also done a phenomenal job, giving each main role to such a diverse cast. Gemma Chan is spectacular as Sersi. Richard Madden is amazing as Ikaris. Chan & Madden share electrifying chemistry together. Angelina Jolie is outstanding as Thena. Kumail Nanjiani is the star of the show as Kingo. Lia McHugh is awesome as Sprite. Brian Tyree Henry is brilliant as Phastos. Lauren Ridloff is awe-inspiring as Makkari. Barry Keoghan is great as Druig. Don Lee is unforgettable as Gilgamesh. Salma Hayek is impressive as Ajak. Harish Patel & Kit Harington are memorable as Karun & Dane Whitman, respectively. The supporting cast is good. Eternals is a must watch for all Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. I promise you won't be disappointed but, expect a one of a kind Marvel film. Can't wait for Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021)!",Eternals
23,abisio,Some unexpected twists but not enough two and a half hour,6,5 November 2021,"Eternals starts with a text explaining the creation of the world and the reason of the Eternals; but the last line says everything changed after the last mission.Then the movie goes to 5000 BC when the seven Eternals arrived, fight some DEVIANT monsters and are introduced. Then moves to present day London where two of them (Sersi and Sprite) interact with humans; but DEVIANTS (who should have been extinct) appears; so they have to fight again.Considering danger is coming back decided reunite the group again. That was pretty much what the trailer showed and takes the first half of the movie giving some screen time to each other character, a real love story and a few suggested. This first half is slow paced and low on action. Some small fights and twists are not enough to keep interest.Suddenly a reveal occurs (not totally unexpected considering the last line of text in the introduction) but turns the movie in something more interesting.Another reveal by the third act turns the story darker (not on the DC COMICS level) but betrayals are resolved too fast predictable; as it is the final fight.The acting do not help at all; Richard Madden has three facial expressions and one of them is when rays come out his eyes. Gemma Chan does not show personality to become the leader and her final showdown is too simple.Salma Hayek is Ok as a motherly leader, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Kit Haringtong are always fun to watch but their screen time is short compared with the first two.Barry Keoghan is the most interesting character and personality here. I saw him in other movies and is an interesting, very deep actor.Angelina Jolie is a surprise. She barely speaks in the first half and her character has little screen time. She is always good but is secondary or even tertiary character here.Last but not least; the script has a lot of holes. Some parts like the DEVIANTs reason to exist does not hold any logic.I have the feeling some things were changed on the editing room. There are trailer scenes that has been changed or eliminated.In any case, by the end there are some spectacular images and few comic moments thanks to Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry.It is not easy to give enough time to seven characters; but some better effort could have been done and took time out of the love story. Is my opinion.In brief; is long not lots of action and a mix of interesting ideas and failed ones. It is your decussation.",Eternals
24,kjproulx,"A Imperfect, Solid MCU Film",7,5 November 2021,"After over a decade of movies and the beginning of television wiggling its way into this universe as well, The Marvel Cinematic Universe is simply one of the most impressive franchises of all time. That's not to say it's the best franchise of all time, just incredibly ambitious without stumbling very often. Eternals is the first film in a very long time, to be this ambitious in introducing this many characters at once. Yes, this is a downside to the film overall, but I really enjoyed watching it. From the terrific direction to the beautiful look and feel, here's why I think Eternals is worth your time, even if you might be someone who won't like it as much as I did.To put it as simply as possible, there are beings known as Celestials. The Celestials are responsible for the creation of all living things in the Universe. Using these powers thousands of years ago, they created a small race known as Eternals. They were placed in our Universe to oversee human existence and only interfere with any conflicts if creatures known as Deviants ever were to arise. Thousands of years later, in the present day, something has awoken them. Needing to get the band back together, this film is purely about the reassemblance of the Eternals in order to stop this looming threat.That description may seem like it makes for a super exciting time at the movies, but please don't go into the film expecting non-stop action like Avengers: Infinity War. This is a film that takes its time, flashing back and forth, teaching you the backstory of these characters so that you care about the consequences moving forward. Chloe Zhao's direction here is very much her style and it's very apparent that she was given the freedom of bringing her tone to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The strongest point of this film is the fact that everyone is likeable. Everyone is given just enough time to make an impact, even though I think more time with each of these characters would've helped it a lot more.Leading up to The Avengers back in 2012, we had films that developed each of the core characters first. This is a film that was trying to bring a team together with far less time and far more characters to boot. It's nearly three hours long, but there are times when it honestly feels like a couple more hours could've helped it. I'm starting to think this story would've worked much better as a Disney+ series that's still connected to this world, but I understand that the ideas presented here were necessary to be seen by a larger audience. This was a huge problem I had with the film, but that aside, I still really liked it.My issue with the characters would've been a lot greater, however, if it wasn't for all of the performers making me care about them. Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan, and Barry Keoghan were probably the biggest standouts to me, all providing a bit more depth than the rest of the cast, but everyone brought their A-Game here and it showed on-screen. On top of the great cast, there are spectacular visuals that are unlike those from other Marvel films. Yes, the CGI creatures and things of that nature are all still present here, but the CGI backgrounds and landscapes all felt very real this time. I really enjoyed the attention to detail when it came to that.In the end, Eternals both feels like a traditional Marvel Cinematic Universe film while also doing things that this franchise hasn't done before. The drab tone, slow pacing, and overall ""Epic"" feel (especially with its runtime) all worked incredibly well for me. I just wish this story had more time to breathe, even with being nearly three hours. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a necessary watch, given the ramifications, this will likely have on the franchise as a whole. As big as this movie feels, I think it only scratched the surface. It's far from perfect, but even with its flaws, this movie really worked for me. Eternals is now playing in theatres and I think it's worth seeing.",Eternals
25,Carycomic,"Better than the ""Venom"" sequel. But, not as riveting as ""Black Widow.""",5,7 November 2021,"I remember buying ETERNALS volume 1/number 1 when the Jack Kirby comic first came out. And I considered it revolutionary. A Marvel Earth where the superheros and super-villains were based on ancient astronaut theory!I was, therefore, sad when the series was cancelled. Although, I was heavily consoled when the dangling plot threads were resolved by THOR v. 1/#300.As for Neil Gaiman's ""Celestial Seed' story arc? That I found considerably less-than-impressive. So, Marvel Films adapting that element into the screenplay of this movie was just as disappointing. Especially with the total revision of the original premise, re: Ikaris being the heroic protagonist and Druig being the traitor!Add all that to the fact that there was one part, early on, that I literally slept through and you have a next-phase Marvel flick that might be useful in introducing the Black Knight to modern cinematic continuity.

27,MrDHWong,"The boldest, most unconventional film the MCU has offered so far",7,4 November 2021,"""Eternals"" is the third film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Chloe Zhao (""Nomadland""), it is the boldest, most unconventional film the MCU has offered so far.For over 7,000 years, the immortal aliens known as the ""Eternals"" have lived secretly among the human race in various places on Earth, watching as they have advanced throughout the course of history. A short time after half of all life was restored during the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", the Eternals each discover that an apocalyptic event known as the ""Emergence"" has begun, causing their ancient foes ""The Deviants"" to reawaken and attack the human population. With the very existence of humanity resting on their shoulders, the Eternals must now collectively reunite to prevent the destruction of everything they have all witnessed come into being.Considering how many years it's been around, the MCU hasn't pushed too many boundaries with the formula it has created. Almost all of them follow a typical template - introduce the hero, establish their significance, have them acquire their powers, make them fight and defeat the villain(s), and tease at their inclusion in future movies. Rinse and repeat. You could argue that there's no point in fixing what isn't broken but at the same time I've always wanted to see them try something new to shake things up a bit. ""Eternals"" happens to take a number of risks with its approach to origin stories and while not all of them succeeded, the ones that did show that there is hope this long running series won't stagnate creatively anytime soon.Rather than the usual everyman or everywoman who gain their superpowers later on, here the titular Eternals are actually omnipotent figures that have always had access to their godlike abilities. As a result, the film doesn't spend any time showing how they all reached their full potential, instead expecting us to accept their unique qualities right away. But this doesn't mean the characters aren't relatable at all, as they still experience the same type of problems as regular humans. In spite of their status as ageless beings, each of them display modern humanlike traits from time to time.For example, the character Sersi has an addiction to her smartphone, enamoured by the convenience of being able to take photos instantly. This is a believable attribute that an individual who looks as youthful as her would have in today's world, which adds some necessary depth to someone who has been alive for thousands of years. Little quirks like this remind the audience that it is possible to feel a connection to these characters without feeling too alienated by their otherworldly origins, and moments like that help distinguish the MCU from the early films of the DC Extended Universe.Coming hot of the tails of winning the Best Director Oscar for ""Nomadland"", Chloe Zhao here delivers a film that could be considered the complete opposite. Whereas ""Nomadland"" was a humble down-to-earth story about people surviving with what they had out on the road, ""Eternals"" instead takes the audience on a different type of journey - an effects-laden exploration of the mythology of heroes. Zhao likens each of the Eternals' interactions with humans to that of the ancient Greek and Roman gods with the impact they've left on mankind's progress throughout history, both positive and negative. Such examples include inventing ploughshares for farmers and later the atomic bomb to bring about the end of a major war. While I do appreciate this vastly different approach to what we're normally used to, the major problem here is that the film focuses too much on fleshing out each member of the Eternals.Since the film has an ensemble cast of more than ten lead characters instead of just one, most of the resulting runtime is unfortunately stuffed with bloated exposition about their overall relevance to the story. I understand the importance of developing each of the characters' individual personalities, but so much time is spent doing this that it causes the second act to drag on way longer than it should. Anyone who is expecting frequent action throughout will be disappointed as most of the best parts occur near the conclusion. Granted, there is a decent amount of emotional weight during this climactic finale, so it was partially worth sitting through the whole thing in the end.Out of all the Eternals, the only one that comes close to being the main protagonist would be Sersi (Gemma Chan), who has the ability to shapeshift any type of matter around her. She is easily the most likeable of the main cast, as she is the emotional glue that holds them all together. As for the rest, I also liked Richard Madden as Ikaris, who can fly and shoot laser beams out of his eyes, and Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, a Bollywood star who can fire energy beams out of his hands. To comment on every other member of the Eternals would take too much time so these three are the only ones I am going to single out here. Although his role is only a minor one, Kit Harrington's character Dane Whitman was amusing as the absent-minded boyfriend of Sersi. It's interesting to see two significant ""Game of Thrones"" actors like Madden and Harrington in the same film together, added by the fact that they each know someone homophonically named Sersi/Cersei.Though ""Eternals"" didn't achieve everything it was setting out to accomplish, it was still bold enough to deviate from the monotonous formula it has had set in stone over the past thirteen years. Naturally there will be many people who will hate this film for doing just that, and that is completely understandable, but personally I admire that it took risks instead of playing it safe as per usual. I don't think every other MCU film should follow suit as this may result in alienating too many hardcore fans, but hopefully this one will leave just enough of an impression to show that the series is capable of trying new things.I rate it 7/10.",Eternals
28,CANpatbuck3664,The Obvious Joke: Marvel Studios Presents The Mehternals,6,7 November 2021,"Eternals has the unenviable task of not only helping reboot the Marvel universe but introducing an entirely new team of characters. Its tougher to do than you think and I would describe the execution as mixed. I did like most of the characters they offered up, they have mixed power sets and perspectives on the Celestials. Each of them are distinct and relatively fun to watch. It's one of the pleasures of a team movie, you get to ride along as they build comraderie and group chemistry. We get some time to spend with each of them and other than Athena and Gilgamesh's dynamic, none of it is particularly involving or compelling. It was a tall task and while Eternals didn't faceplant on developing the characters, it didn't stick the landing either.I was a little surprised about how big of a cast this project was able to put together. But Marvel has the money to write big cheques with many zeroes so that may have played a factor as well. Gemma Chan and Richard Madden are the two actors with the most screen time and while they are both capable and charismatic performers, they're handcuffed by their characters. They're both a little wooden, I want to believe that they were directed to be that way to sell the unfeeling and godly nature of their characters but it made it more difficult to empathize with their struggle. I felt bad for Angelina Jolie, she showed up to work and she does a great job. Her character is also the most interesting on the team. But the movie has her alternate between fighting and freaking out and there's little room to show her range in between. Kumail Nanjiani provides the movie with some much needed levity but a lot of his material feels like retreads of Tony Stark's snarky one-liners and I just didn't laugh as much as I wanted to. I also want to credit Brian Tyree Henry (his scene in 1945 is easily the most emotionally impactful in the movie), Ma Dong-Seok and Lia McHugh for their work in their supporting parts. I thought Salma Hayek and Barry Keoghan were interesting casting choices and they both play well against type.If you're going to check this out on the big screen, you're going to want some big action set pieces. Eternals doesn't reinvent the wheel but I did like a lot of the fight scenes. The different powers the group possesses are utilized well and while the Deviants are pretty generic, I did like how they adapted to the Eternals and became more difficult to fight as the movie went on. So from that angle, Eternals scratches that itch.There are plenty of things to praise in Eternals but there are just as many weaknesses. They put too much on this movie, there's so much setup and between the odd editing for the flashbacks and jumping back and forth between locations and different periods of time, Eternals feels unfocused. It's also just too long, you feel the 2.5 hr runtime and with how slack the pacing can get, I was definitely shifting around in my seat and checking my phone.I feel bad for Chloe Zhao and the Eternals creative team. Eternals is a passable superhero flick, the action scenes are solid, the cast is game and the effects look good. Everything should add up to a success here. But the movie is bloated, too exposition heavy and despite a diverse cast of characters, you can't really bond with them over their struggle. It just feels too derivative for Marvel and while that's understandable considering their longevity and the weight of the expectations, it doesn't make Eternals any better. I saw this with a couple of friends and one of them compared it to Green Lantern. I think its better than that effort but its fairly good match. Skip Eternals in the theatre but if you're a ride or die Marvel fan, check it out on Disney Plus.",Eternals

I feel like it was a bit of a misfire.. which is very rare for Marvel... the film contains a lot of world building stuff to set up the Eternals storyline which requires an awful lot of flashbacks and back story... which hampers the forward momentum of the main story...

That being said, as an origin story, there is no need to be familiar with previous MCU films in order to feel confident watching this one, as it's a stand-alone outing.An interesting aspect to this film is how it offers an alternative myth to the rise of humans as well as implying that myths and legends which exist in our actual history are wrong. The names of the Eternals play on this notion, with characters called Ikarus (played by Richard Madden), Sersi (Gemma Chan), Ajak (Salma Hayek), Gilgamesh (Don Lee) and Thena (Angelina Jolie) to name but a few. Given how American Christians have protested against 'Satanic' heavy metal music or even Harry Potter, for goodness sake, I'm surprised that they haven't protested against this film for challenging biblical accounts of the nature of the universe!Now, seeing how these Eternals are depicted as advancing human civilisation over millennia, I suppose that could make one roll one's eyes in disappointment. Maybe I did this initially but I just submitted to the myth and went along for the ride. At the back of my mind, however, was the thought that this depiction patronised humans. If Marvel's counter-myth, which short-changes the ingenuity of humans offends, well, at least be calmed by the knowledge that the works of William Shakespeare aren't attributed to any of the Eternals!I can't say that seeing this film was something that I was keen to do but I did come across some information somewhere that it was (or would be) directed by Academy Award winning director Chloé Zhao, a woman who grew up in China (she is the first Asian woman to win an Academy Award for direction). Even though I hadn't seen any of her previous films, that tidbit was enough of a lure for me to see the film, out of curiosity at least. It was a punt which I'm glad I took, in contrast to a similar scenario, which was also in the MCU, where another Academy Award winning director Ang Lee (a man who was born in Taiwan) directed ""Hulk"". That Lee film was quite a disappointment to me (I'd say that I saw that before I began reviewing films on the original ""The movie show"" website and then moved to this site when SBS closed their website). It was conceivable to me that I would also find Zhao's film pretentious and underwhelming but she's done a solid job here. Seeing a trailer for this film recently, it didn't look promising on the comedy front at least, with that scene where an Eternal breaks a table. It looked like humour aimed at very small children. However, I can say that I did laugh other times, so the humour improved (I especially liked the inside humour about online video creators).If you've seen the two most recent ""Avengers"" films and the opinions of supervillain Thanos gave you pause for thought, well, you might like the direction that ""Eternals"" goes into, as it takes this to a whole 'nother level, perhaps, with the character of Arishem.Anyway, I enjoyed this film but I don't think that I'd make a point of seeing it again and I might not be interested in seeing any sequels (unless, maybe, Zhao also directs it and...the Avengers aren't in it, perhaps). This MCU outing had a diverse cast and diverse characters. A minor gripe for me though was finding it hard to understand dialogue on some occasions, either because of accents or the use of audio effects, like that used for the voice of Arishem.The following are just random observations for my own benefit:* Is it weird that Eternals are extraterrestrial in origin yet are otherwise like humans? I mean, I assume that humans can interbreed with them!* Is it weird that the extraterrestrial Eternals have sex in the missionary position?* Is it weird that these supreme Eternal beings include the deaf amongst their ranks?* One Eternal, ""Sprite"" (Lia McHugh) reminded me of a similar character in ""Interview with the vampire"" (I think...my memory could be faulty here). Why is there such a young Eternal? What's that all about?* I was also wondering about the point of the Deviants but if I imagined them to be the inspiration for the concept of ""demons"", they didn't bother me so much.* One of Ikarus' superpowers reminded me of Superman...this is referenced later on in the film.* One part which I found to be unbelievable was where early humans take up arms against obviously much more powerful Eternals...which have just helped them. That didn't ring true to me...for those two reasons.* Lastly, I found the Eternals' frequent ruminations on what makes humans worth saving insipid.* Lastly, lastly, my scoring for this film was tracking at 75% (7 out of 10 stars here), then 75+% (8 out 10 stars) then my final score of 77.5%.",Eternals
33,ethanbresnett,"A slightly new flavour for Marvel, and a very tasty flavour indeed",8,6 November 2021,"If I were to use one word to sum up Eternals it would be beautiful. Beautiful story, characters, score, visuals, themes. Everything in this film just felt like such a treat.What I loved most was how much there was to discover and learn. Eternals lifts the lid on a whole new world within the MCU and it was just a joy to get to know these new characters, who were all very different and exciting. I was concerned that introducing 10 characters would be a handful, but it was masterfully done. All of them felt well explored and developed and there were no weak links.As you'd expect from such a solid cast list the performances were great. Highlights were Gemma Chan, Richard Madden and Angelina Jolie, all of whom were so captivating, but really all of the cast nailed it.I thought the plot was very interesting. A few unexpected twists and turns, moral quandaries, compelling themes, exciting if a little repetitive at times action. A bit of a deviance from the usual MCU formula but a most welcome one indeed.As mentioned the visuals were stunning. Zhao's direction can't be faulted and was complimented perfectly by the epic score provided by Ramin Djawadi.As a final point, because I've seen other reviewers accuse the film of being slow, the pacing was absolutely spot on. It flowed so well, took its time but was never meandering or lost. For a film that is over two hours thirty it absolutely flew by.I got everything I wanted and more from this film. It was a visual feast and an engaging and compelling story with complex characters. Arguably a bit of a risk for the MCU but it has massively paid off.",Eternals

35,colewaters,Cinematic masterpiece,10,6 November 2021,The Eternals is a cinematic masterpiece. From start to end this movie is a hit.

36,akshatmahajan,Very loose script,5,5 November 2021,"I was really excited for this movie and went to see this with good expectations but nothing went as expected.Script was loose and screenplay was very shattered. There were problems with editing also. Direction also felt weak, didn't seem like it was directed by Oscar winner director.Story was weak and childish and it looked like if too much was added in the movie. This could have been easily two part movie.Overall, this movie was an unexpected disappointment. Hope, they improve in sequels.",Eternals
37,Puroo,It's getting unnecessary hate,10,6 November 2021,"First everyone says MCU movies are too much similar, and now when one is different they have problem with that? This is hypocrisy.Personally I liked it. I will any day choose this over Black Widow. All the MCU haters are just giving it negative reviews without even seeing the movie, because they know they don't get this opportunity too often.",Eternals
38,aarongnr,"I don't understand how this movie is ""dense""",8,4 November 2021,"So many critics and reviewers here said this movie is ""dense"" or there is alot to ""unpack"". I don't get it. The story is very straightforward, little to no exposition.Most of the movie is about the drama between the characters and them finding out more about the ""Emergence"". And the twist at the midpoint of the movie is really the only big exposition dump, and it's like 3 minutes and actually quite interesting.I liked it. It was entertaining to me. I liked the lore expansion alot, it made sense to me. And I'm a sucker for lore.The biggest weakness of the movie to me, and others will feel totally different about this, is that I couldn't root for the Eternals. The movie didn't present an alternate solution to Arishem's plan to create a new Eternal and with it trillions of lives. Without an alternative what the Eternals are doing is just selfish to me. Safe Billions and prevent trillions from existing and also help the universe fall into darkness. To me the Eternal's decision was the wrong one here. It's definitely a dilemma, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth.Anyway, contrary to many others, I liked the Deviants. Their purpose wasn't to be the movie's antagonists, not at all. It was to show that the Deviants and the Eternals weren't so different, and after the ""Prime Deviant"" got Ajaks powers (free will as a part of it) we see that his objective changes. His objective is no longer to follow their creators design to kill all live on earth, but rather to protect his kind from the ones that want to harm them: The Eternals. I liked this. The Eternals are not the ""bad guys of this movie"". Actually, there isn't one. The movie is one big moral dilemma.Not everything worked well, but I'll give this a solid 8. It's not a dense movie.",Eternals
39,gavinp9,"Not bad, just a bit strained",6,4 November 2021,"'Eternals' is both a Marvel superhero film, but also not - unlike some other MCU films having lesser-known superheroes, this is almost a parallel universe, or a 'What If?' episode, with 10 new Eternals (good immortal aliens) introduced to us in 5,000BC that help save humans from Deviants (bad aliens), sent by Celestials (big aliens). The film spends most of it's time in 2021, but has plenty of flashbacks over the previous millennia.As they're not mainstream heroes, they all seem to have a generic power, with no-one being too special. As with all ensemble casts, not everyone gets much screen-time and it takes a while to figure out who does what and how they fit in. For the record, Ajak (Hayek) is the leader, with Sersi (Chan; the heart of the film) and Ikaris (Madden) essentially acting as the leads/love interests. The next most screen-time goes to Sprite (McHugh, the ""kid"") and Kingo (Nanjiani, a little comedic relief). Then there's Thena (Jolie, barely used), Phastos (Tyree Henry), Makkari (Ridloff), Druig (Keoghan, such a punchable face) and Gilgamesh (Dong-seok). Once you figure out who's who, it's basically over!There's not really a ""big bad guy"" as such, and the whole Celestials thing is pretty laughable, but if you go with it, there's still quite a bit that doesn't really come together until the end. The final 30min or so is pretty exciting, but there's certainly a sizeable lull in the middle. It certainly has it's moments, with some good CGI, but the stakes never seem quite as high as they should and the tone is often a bit too dour, with not as much fun and effervescence as I'd expect. The post-credits scenes create more questions for the next set of films to answer.",Eternals
40,flicklover,A total mess!!! But kind of won me over in the end!!!,6,6 November 2021,"Well here is another MCU film. One that has gotten some pretty negative reviews before it came out. I am not a believer in the internet determining my opinion on a film but it definitely can affect my expectations. I knew virtually nothing about Eternals. Not a fan of the comic so this was my first exposure to the story and characters.Eternals is about a group of immortal beings with superhuman powers that have lived on earth among us for thousands of years. Supposedly they are on earth to defend humanity against The Deviants. Their evil counterparts. The film is very much like The Avengers in that it tries to give most of the characters their moments. It is a big cast so I won't go into each characters but there are some standouts. Gemma Chan plays Sersi. Another chatacter that liked was Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos. He us an inventor that is supposedly responsible for some inventions that he regrets such as the Atomic Bomb. The other characters are ok but one of the films weaknesses is that like most MCU films is that some characters seem to be in the film for comic relief. In the first hour I was not into the film. I was think that it
may definitely be the worst Marvel film I've seen. It felt slow and even though there was really high stakes in the story it seemed too jokey to take seriously. It even felt like a spoof at times. One other thing s the film goes back and forth in time to tells it's story. Between present day and thousands of years in the past. This style of storytelling works for me at times but here it was distracting. The film is directed by Chloé Zhao. A highly celebrated director of last year's Best Picture Nomadland. She has a great visual style and even though the action scenes are well done, they aren't much better than most MCU films. The difference here is that there are some heavier themes she deals with in the film. The problem is that it us so jokey at times that it diminished the more serious themes. This film is being sold as a very different take on a comic book film in the MCU. I do agree that it is a little different it pretty much like most other of the MCU films. It's not different enough but it dies try to distinguish itself at times.I'm glad to say that it wasn't the bomb that some were saying it was but I would say it's hit and miss. But it did grow on me a bit in the end.Grade: C+",Eternals
41,ayoreinf,Can we trust our gods?,9,8 November 2021,"This new team of super heroes is more than just ""different"" it's dealing with real deep issues one hardly ever finds in a comics book. It's more than the basic moral questions built into the comics genre, namely good versus evil; the responsibility coming with power; and who's watching over the watchmen? Which for themselves are deep moral questions that all the best comic based movies dealt with. This one asks us questions about free will; the overall sanctity of life; what is the nature of evolution? Do creatures that were created eternals and made to remain the same for eternity - Do they really remain the same?All these questions (and some I chose not to mention here to keep this thing from going way too long) push this comics saga into the realm of true science fiction. A realm only the X-Men visit regularly while other comics based movies only touch upon fleetingly. This is not a complaint - I love sci - fi with all my heart, I also love good comics, but the combination is really my personal favorite combination. Thing is, this calls for some very deft writing and directing - mission accomplished - It does make the movie slightly slower than most comics based movies but I found the story so riveting I hardly felt the time passing. The acting is superb, and I don't know who to commend because they all do their jobs as well as I could imagine it. The visuals, as some already mentioned here, are amazing, including some very nice timepieces that look spot on.Bottom line I loved it. It could easily sink into platitudes and slogans - but the writing and the acting kept it real. Go see it, but know in advance that you're stepping into uncharted territory.",Eternals
42,movieman6-413-929510,Eternals seems a bit too separate from the rest of the Marvel film series.,4,4 November 2021,"Eternals is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and part written by Chloé Zhao, the director of The Rider and Nomadland.The film is about a group of aliens called Eternals, who have been protecting humanity from evil creatures called Deviants since the beginning. Since the defeat of this evil, the Eternals have remained hidden on Earth without further affecting the lives of humanity, but after an unexpected tragedy, the Eternals must spring back into action to investigate this tragedy. Most are sure that this can only mean that the Deviants return to Earth.With this film, Chloé Zhao and fellow screenwriters introduce a new group of creatures to the Marvel film series. Due to the large unfamiliarity of this group and the fact that the co-screenwriters are at the beginning of their careers, this film may seem unclear to people who are otherwise unfamiliar with the Eternals. The reason that they only now appear in the film series also seems a bit forced and the film is also very separate from the rest of the Marvel film series. Only a few characters from the film series are mentioned by name, making this film almost as connected as the Marvel Netflix series.The story can also be tricky to follow, as it often jumps from the present to the past to give some brief explanations about certain things that come up later in the film. Furthermore, the Eternals observe humanity more and sometimes give their assessment. Chloé Zhao seems to have done this so that as a viewer you also get a kind of history lesson about the good and bad sides of humanity. In this way the film loses its entertaining side and it almost comes across as a kind of argument. The film also lacks real suspense, as this only comes when suddenly and Deviant shows up to cause some chaos. Marvel producer Kevin Feige may have been a little dazzled with arranging for Chloé Zhao as director after she broke into the film world last year after winning two Oscars. Chloé Zhao manages to capture a few scenes nicely, but these are the scenes that were filmed on location. Other scenes shot in the film studio seem less believable. The green screen is often clearly visible here, which makes the film lose its credibility. The CGI used for transferring the Deviants or the superpowers of the Eternals is often also clearly visible. These beings and powers do not always come across as credible. This film is the 26th film in the Marvel film series, which makes it special that after so many films, the effects suddenly seem to be less compared to most other films in the series. The film is also not necessary to see in 3D, because there are only a few scenes in which this effect can be seen.Due to the size of the film cast, the acting comes across as nice, but nobody really gets the chance to come across clearly as the main character of the film. All characters with their own powers and difficult names are difficult for the viewer to remember. At the end of the movie you don't know exactly who each character was and what they could do. Most characters are remembered more thanks to the actor who plays the character. Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani remain the most remembered for their fame, despite the fact that these big names didn't even get the most time in the film.",Eternals
43,darkreignn,Unexpectedly entertaining,8,7 November 2021,"With movies such as ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Thor: The Dark World"" gracing the catalogue of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it's a wonder to me that ""Eternals"" is the MCU motion picture that has the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score. However, before watching ""Eternals,"" I wasn't surprised - super hero fatigue is the newest disease that seems to be infecting the public. All of that said, imagine my genuine shock when the credits rolled and I found myself actually having enjoyed this movie quite a bit. ""Eternals"" isn't perfect, but its genuinely exciting action, intriguing narrative, and shocking surprises make for a super hero movie that, while not breaking the mold, doesn't fit perfectly into it.""Eternals"" starts strong with an action sequence taking place in the year 5000 B. C. Featuring our titular heroes, the Eternals are shown fighting monsters known as the Deviants. The Eternals' powers are depicted in all their spectacular glory, and while many of them are similar to specific DC counterparts (The Flash and Superman will come immediately to mind), it doesn't make this sequence, and their powers, any less exciting. The Eternals aren't afraid to slice, dice, and otherwise demolish the Deviants, which can make for some brutal fights, especially for a Marvel movie. However, one thing that can and will manage to put a damper on your enjoyment of this film's action is the fact that many of the sequences take place in dimly lit, nighttime environments. No doubt an attempt to save money on computer generated images, this stylistic decision makes many action scenes difficult to comprehend - as you can imagine, this is particularly infuriating because, after all, ""Eternals"" is an action film.That said, even if I had to strain my eyes to decipher the onscreen happenings, I found myself enjoying the action scenes as a whole because, well, I started to really take a liking to many of the characters. Yes, ""Eternals"", which is no doubt a long film, does contain the trademarked Marvel mediocre dialogue and rushed characterization. So I'm not sure if it was the charisma of the actors and actresses or what, but I began to truly find myself entertained by the Eternals and their interactions with one another. Richard Madden as Ikaris and Lia McHugh as Sprite were the two standouts for me; usually I dislike child actors in films, but Lia was very good playing an immortal super hero who so desperately wants to live a normal life. Richard Madden's Ikaris was immediately likable - headstrong and cocky when he wants to be, and resilient and steadfast when he must, Ikaris brought some genuine surprises in this film, especially in the last act. Most of the other actors were good as well, but unfortunately, underutilized. Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek play small, but pivotal roles in this movie; they are both top tier actresses, so I was really hoping they'd play a bigger part. Barry Keoghan as Druig is also a show stealer, with one scene in particular featuring him being my favorite of the entire film.The story that ""Eternals"" decides to tell may not be the freshest, but the way it is told is certainly unique. Featuring scenes that take place in both modern day and in the past, ""Eternals"" feels like a sprawling adventure. Chloé Zhao's directing adds a stylistic flair that is much needed, especially when compared to the other fairly flat looking Marvel movies. She is also unafraid to tell this story by shocking the audience; I found the twists and turns to be very unexpected - I won't spoil them in this review, but let's just say the formulaic CGI boss battle that most super hero movies employ isn't necessarily the direction that Zhao decides to take this story.Honestly, I'm slightly shocked by how poorly received this film has been. When compared to other films in the MCU, ""Eternals"" is, in my opinion, one of the better ones. Much less predictable and formulaic, this film's unique story and entertaining characters makes for an enjoyable super hero experience.",Eternals
44,FallenEye,"Eternals ""Abort"" Mission on Mother Earth.",6,8 November 2021,"Unfortunately Eternals managed to fill an entire two and a half hours with mostly pretty pictures and pretty people, with the story and its logic, intrigue and engagement falling by the wayside, leaving Eternals to playout more like an over budget CW show rather than a quality MCU instalment.When compared to additions that have similar runtimes in the franchise, like The Avengers, Civil War, Infinity War, Endgame and even Age of Ultron, it becomes even clearer that Eternals is an inferior inclusion. It simply did not use its time effectively. With all the time it had, it didn't manage to establish any of the characters properly, accept maybe Sprite, which made their motivations inconsequential for the audience.How the Eternals ended up defeating the Celestial left much to be desired as well, as it was in a way the was very throwaway-like, somewhat convenient, and easy, while the fact that these Eternals can even defeat universe creating Celestials is rather questionable itself, and even though that may be based on the comic book material, the movie failed in making it a plausible feat.Also, these Celestials making mistakes like not erasing memories properly, creating creatures they can't control, and not establishing fail-safes to ensure that the Prime Eternals submit to their demands, feels incredibly stupid for beings that ought to have an out of this world level of intellect.Perhaps the best part of the movie was the battle between Makkari and Ikaris; the imagery there was stunning, while these two characters were also perhaps the best in the movie, along with Sprite.In the end, Marvel Studios under Kevin Feige is incapable of making ""bad"" movies at this point, therefore, Eternals is not a bad movie, however, its simply not good enough. Its story is flawed, humor at most parts is misplaced/not funny as usual, has very little character development, lacks energetic engagement, and has a forgettable score, but, the cinematography, some of the action scenes and the actors were good at different levels, while the overall project was adequately decent.6.4/10.",Eternals
45,TheVictoriousV,"More like eternally long, amirite?",4,5 November 2021,"By casting an actress that has already played a major part in one of the films, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has run into a problem it frankly should've run into sooner, given the sheer size of it (just look at how quickly it happened with the poor saps at DC, casting Djimon Hounsou in two separate roles in films released not four months apart). We now have Gemma Chan, who played a Kree in Captain Marvel, in the role of a peaceful Eternal.The most important question on your mind right now is probably: Wait, what's an Eternal? And how have I missed that there's a new Marvel Studios movie out?Indeed, Eternals seems to have the Marvel geeks mildly enthused at best (I'll include myself here if ""pretty decent knowledge"" counts as being a Marvel geek, even if I've had mixed reactions towards the MCU). This may be because this feels like a more generic MCU prequel, focusing squarely on a particular character or group. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the MCU, we have the aftermath of Thanos' ""snap"" and boy is sh-t getting freaky!We've had Wanda Maximoff creating a pocket dimension wherein other universes appeared to ""bleed through"", which, even though it was a fake-out, led to exploring different timelines within the MCU we all know and then seemingly getting into PREVIOUS big-screen Marvel universes, judging from what we know of the next Spider-Man movie -- which, yes, is set to star both the Maguire and Garfield versions of the web-slinger (don't get me started on the Morbius trailer). Eternals? Yawn.Okay, on to some actual new review content: From what I've understood of Marvel Comics lore, the Eternals are the people of Thanos (who's also a ""Titan"" but I guess that's more to do with migration) and since that villain needs to be upstaged, the only possibility is Galactus, but we don't even get a tease for him here. Another thing that would make sense, now that we're getting real cosmic, is a follow-up on Guardians of the Galaxy's tease for Adam Warlock but no cigar. The Eternals themselves don't have much marquee value and the trailers have done little to make anyone but the hardcore Marvel simps especially hopeful.What this means, as I'm sure you've noticed, is that the Usual Journalists have had to bend over even further backwards than normal to make this film seem remotely exciting. I've seen reviews that grasp at all the straws they can find to paint this bland, bloated video game-looking garbage as great filmmaking (even when the reviews praise nothing in particular), and writers of the same ilk have had to REALLY doll out the ""firsts"" -- first gay superhero, first deaf superhero, first *insert race* superhero, first MCU sex scene (the first Iron Man begs to differ), and so on. Did you think all those sexist Black Widow haters were bad? Well, just you wait. You're all kinds of -phobe if you don't like this one!We learn that these Eternals have watched over humankind for thousands of years, including years where they definitely could've lent a hand in defeating the likes of Hitler, Mussolini, or indeed Thanos. We do learn that they were instructed by the all-powerful Celestials to only interfere if ""Deviants"" are involved. We learn all kinds of things, but don't really wind up liking anyone, nor do we get to see anything that sets these powerful, humanoid aliens apart from most of the other powerful, humanoid aliens we've seen in the MCU -- apart from when they generate swirly gold that looks kind of cool. One of them even borrows a trick from Loki.The cast is rich, to be sure, featuring Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani (whose ""Bollywood"" scenes constitute a highlight), Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek, and Harry Styles as Thanos' brother Starfox (and yes, the Mad Titan's sibling looked like a boyband twink in the comics too). These actors do fine, but their assignment is to play generic comic-book characters in a generic MCU film that I'm forgetting more and more as I'm writing this -- aside from a few truly cringeworthy jokes and bizarre references to DC Comics.At least we're getting Blade soon, apparently.",Eternals
46,Chalice_Of_Evil,Eternal love...,8,4 November 2021,"Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest. I personally was holding out hope that this would finally be an MCU film with a group of characters from space who I actually liked and weren't a bunch of a-holes. An opening crawl not only explains who Eternals are, but Deviants and Celestials too. There's enough exposition through dialogue to answer any questions one might have whilst watching (such as why these Eternals were 'Switzerland' during the battle against Thanos). Complaints about this film being 'confusing' because it alternates between past and present must just be from those with short attention spans, as it's really quite obvious what time period the movie's in at any given time thanks to helpful location title cards. Too many characters? I think not. Endgame had 30-something characters and nobody complained. Each of these Eternals has a distinct personality.Salma Hayek gives good wise leader as Ajak, who can heal, but her decision-making causes some conflict with the others. Gemma Chan (who I became a fan of thanks to her nuanced performance in the TV series Humans) has a certain quality about her that makes her the perfect fit for Sersi, whose power is molecular manipulation. She experiences self-doubt, but there's more to her than she thinks. Long ago she was involved with Richard Madden's character, Ikaris, who's kind of like Superman (one unexpected thing in this movie is the shout-outs to the MCU 'rivals', DC, with the Superman/Batman mentions) with the flying/eyebeams/super-strength. Over the course of the movie we find out why he left Sersi, and like her character, he's got more going on than you might expect. Madden's a natural fit as the 'leading man' type and he really brings it when it comes to conveying the conflicted emotions his character feels.Kit Harington plays Dane Whitman, who's someone Sersi could be happy with until Ikaris' return throws a spanner in the works. Those wishing to see the two GoT actors reunited onscreen should be happy with the scene where their characters size each other up, but thankfully it never descends into teen drama love triangle angst. After watching the trailers, the one character I wasn't sure I'd be fond of was the young-in-appearance redheaded girl, Sprite, whose power is creating illusions. Whilst she isn't *too* bad for the majority of the movie, she did annoy me towards the end and I was peeved she didn't face suitable consequences for her actions, instead seemingly being *rewarded* with something she'd always wanted (her crush on older-looking men/willingness to follow them no matter what makes her seem quite shallow). Turns out my first instincts/gut reaction to her was correct. She's a brat.They soon seek out the other Eternals because a cataclysmic event called 'the Emergence' (involving a Celestial, that's big enough to dwarf a planet, hatching from the planet Earth...which's bad news for humanity) is imminent. They first find Kingo (whose power is shooting beams similar to Ikaris' eyebeams...except from his hands) filming Bollywood movies. He provides a bit of light relief from the doom/gloom, but it's his valet, Karun, who steals their scenes. Gilgamesh (who punches really hard) and Thena (who kicks major ar$e) next rejoin the group, and there was a nice dynamic between them. Angelia Jolie may surprise some with how much emotion she brings to the role of Thena. She has something happen to her which proves a problem for everyone, but Gilgamesh stands by her, making for a good character relationship. Characters who arrive later include Druig (a mind-controller), Makkari (a speedster) and Phastos (an inventor). Each serves a purpose in the story and the actors do the most with what they're given.It was nice to have a memorable/epic theme tune in an MCU movie again and the film's score is quite beautiful, as is the cinematography. There are breathtaking shots throughout, the fights feel visceral, the CGI is as convincing as one can hope for in creating such otherworldly things (those Celestials are quite the sight to behold) and I don't get complaints about the Eternals' costumes (as I, for one, welcome anything that isn't Thor: Ragnarok-esque/looking like it could be purchased at a discount costume shop). I saw people ragging on the 'basic'/'cheap'-looking Eternals spaceship, but I appreciate the simplicity of their ship wedge. Sci-fi movies seem to want to keep creating more and more outlandish-looking ships and eventually it'll reach the point where they become SO bizarre-looking you'll wonder, ""WTF kind of functionality does that have?"". There are mid-credits/post-credits scenes to hang around for; the former introducing what seems like a rather important character (whose casting may surprise some) while the latter promises more to come for a certain character/actor who felt a bit underutilized in this film.I'm annoyed at the fact people have been badmouthing this film (some giving it 1/10 star ratings without even having *seen* it). Yes, the movie's 'different', but that's not a BAD thing. Some had complained about the MCU being 'formulaic', yet when it tries something new/different, they complain about that too. I LIKE the fact that this movie offered something we hadn't seen before. It was refreshing. Quite a few of the MCU films have been popular with the 'majority' whilst I personally haven't liked them, then there have been a few ones that haven't been that popular that I've actually liked. So, this criticism Eternals is receiving means very little to me. Also, you have to factor in that this movie features some things that will make a certain group of individuals biased against it/rate it far lower than it deserves. I honestly don't know why anyone puts so much faith in one website and its ratings to determine whether a movie is 'successful' or not, when really what EVERYONE should be doing is seeing it for themselves before they judge instead of bandwagon-jumping. I, for one, hope we get to see more of these Eternals and the negative reviews/haters don't rob us of that.",Eternals

However once in a while a real gem show us why we still love the genre and Eternals is one of those.This is so surprisingly great that I gave it a 9/10 which is the highest I given anything superhero-y in a very, very long time.Acting is fantastic, directing great, music score amazing, set pieces and sets lovely. The movie is cinematography porn mixed with great characters, brilliant writing and superb entertainment.Two things bothered me. First of many of the little quips or ""jokes"" is very out of place. This is a great masterful movie with space Gods, galaxies and amazing technology, and it is also a bit dark and grittier than you might think so those ""jokes"" seldom land very well. This is definitely a Marvel-sickness they need to get rid off, way too much of that in this movie. The second thing is that the movie is too short. I know most people will claim otherwise, and most reviewers will say it is too long or have slow pacing, but I completely disagree. This is so amazingly done that I want 2 hours more, plus there are a lot of characters and we need to get to know them better.There are two end credit scenes, both are a bit too comic-y so if you do not know who these characters are or know the lore you might miss a few things.This is one of the best superhero movies Marvel has done, I would put it just below the two or three top movies. I had very low expectations though so that might have helped my score and surprise enjoyment, but this is very well done. 9/10 and I highly recommend.",Eternals

50,Lewis_Heather787,Oh no.......*face palm*,3,6 November 2021,"This is going to be a biased review, plain and simple. Firstly I don't care about these (MCU) films anymore whatsoever, thought it would be better after ""Endgame"" to just stop the franchise. Why do they need to keep making films..............oh yeah for money.........my bad I just remembered. If I'm being honest I have been in the minority for a long time, the MCU to me is very hit and miss............although I never thought they could miss this poorly.Lets try and talk about some positives first. Let me think here Mmmm.......... Gemma Chan was trying very hard to at least give some resemblance of a good performance however with this script its almost impossible. She carried the film well and did standout so congrats to her, its not her fault this film is bad. Also Angelina Jolie......*sigh*......for years there have been rumours that she had turned down offers to appear in ""comic book"" films. This is the one that she picked! For me she is the best part of the film, which isn't saying much, however her performance throughout is good and her character is slightly interesting. She deserved a better film!!!The rest of the cast, I cant really remember. A few of them were really annoying and bland. Not very memorable whatsoever.Sadly though there is going to be a certain section of society that will hate this film regardless of seeing it or for its actual issues. I do like the very bold attempt and showing probably the most diverse cast of characters in a film I think I've seen period. Chloe Zhao and Kevin Feige should be applauded for doing this and hopefully with some luck this will become so normal that we won't have to talk about it or bring it up. The diversity of the film is not its problem !! For me its issues are far far worse then that!!Story!!! My god is this story bland, boring, unoriginal, overly complicated, cliche, laughable and just all over the place. I don't think I've seen many films from Marvel, under the Disney umbrella, that have been as messy as this one. From my point of view this film has too many characters and plot points going on for its own good. Introducing a lot of brand new information to the audience for the first time...........its a lot to take in. Sadly the film does not pull it off whatsoever!!To me this film is a brand new modern state of the art skyscraper but with the foundations of three old wooden chair legs. The film may look good from the outside, have a good cast and decent special effects however its (foundation) story and place in this universe does not make one bit of sense.Its obvious to me that they rushed this into production, its even more surprising considering the fact this film was delayed a year for covid. ""Eternals"" should have been split up into multiple films, that way the story and characters could have had more time to be fleshed out. However with a 2hr 30 min runtime, this film feels like an eternity already.30% out 100 this film is bad at its core. Two decent performances, some ok character interaction. However its surrounded by a dull, boring and unoriginal rushed story that is all over the place. If you loved this film great, good for you.........this film have major issues for me, its sadly though in 2021 not the thing thats gonna be talked about.",Eternals
51,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Its not a rotten film,8,5 November 2021,"Having just gotten back home from seeing the film, I honestly dont get the hate it was getting. Its certainly not a ""rotten film"". My biggest issue is that with it being a team movie vs a solo, I did feel there was a lot of backstory to set up. And unfortunetly I think some characters get more development than others. But I overall enjoyed it. I thought it had a good balance of action, comedy and emotion. And while I didnt cry, I nearly did with a certain scene involving Ikarus and Sersi. I also liked the character building done for Sprite. She reminded me of ""Claudia"" from Interview with the Vampire"" in a lot of ways. And I loved what it had to say around ""religion"" and blindy following your faith. I thought it was a very interesting and fascinating movie and definitely would be interested in expanding upon the mythos and characters. Not a perfect movie by any means. I would rank it, i dont know....maybe somewhere between 12-20. I'd possibly have to do some rewatches to get an exact number, but I think I can fairly say its not a top 10 film, nor is it bottom of the bunch. I'd rate this film a 7.5 (I rounded up to 8 here).",Eternals

Even the critics on Rotten Tomatoes on struggled with this one.,Eternals
53,ladymidath,A Solid Marvel Movie,10,9 November 2021,"I know that there are quite a few people who don't like Eternals and I can understand why. It's not as action packed as The Avengers and Iron Man but it is still a good entry into the Marvel Universe movies. The visuals are absolutely stunning and like all Marvel and DC films, the music was spot on. The main characters were well established and the actors were well cast. The storyline is very Marvel formula which I think is going to eventually become a problem as people will become so used to it that they will become bored. But that was not the case here. The story was interesting enough to keep me watching and the dynamic between the different characters kept me engaged. I found myself liking these characters and wanting to follow their stories.The special effects were great, but with both Marvel and DC, I would expect nothing less. There were a couple of small twists but nothing really huge and there were a few side characters that were really likable and engaging. I won't go right into the plot as there are so may reviews, but if you like an action movie with real heart, this is for you.",Eternals
54,SPZMaxinema,"I enjoyed it! Enough, I suppose.",7,7 November 2021,"There were characters in this movie that I really liked individually! Especially Phastos (who knocked it out of the park with the humor, along with Kingo). So good acting for the most part, except for Angelina Jolie, who is not good at being sad and at crying. Plus, Richard Madden looks very similar to Sebastian Stan/Bucky, and they could've easily casted someone else to play his role.The action sequences were pretty cool to look at too, some good grand fun! And the ending was a real shocker with the main villain, just wait and see!The main issue with the film though is that it's so jumbled for someone who doesn't follow the comic books closely enough. I found myself getting confused and not fully comprehending the mythology, leaving me with many questions and making it so that I was loosely following the film, instead of being on the same page with it. Some of the character motivations and relationships didn't make much sense as well, and I feel like earlier MCU films are easier to follow since most are already familiar with the characters and their origin stories are simpler to understand. I didn't care for the deviants one bit either. Overall, not bad, but definitely not my favorite Marvel film or one I'd watch again. It was meh, and I expect greatness from most of not all Marvel films. Maybe I shouldn't anymore.",Eternals

56,fredschaefer-406-623204,Who are the Eternals?,9,7 November 2021,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe jumps head on into its next phase with Chloe Zhao's adaptation of the ETERNALS, based on characters created by Jack Kirby back in 1976, for what would be a 19 issue run of a series that initially was separate from the rest of the Marvel continuity at the time. Kirby's original series was strongly influence by Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYESSY, and the Arthur C. Clarke story it was based on in that worked off the theme of a highly advanced alien civilization coming to earth thousands of years in the past, and then guiding human evolution. In Kirby's book, the title characters are super powered beings who are given the responsibility of watching over development of humanity by the Celestials, a race of giant, omnipotent beings, who will one day return and judge if the human race is worthy of continuing their existence. These 10 Eternals appear to be humans, and live among them, but are forbidden to interfere with the course of human history, standing aside during wars, genocides, and every manner of catastrophe. Their opposites are the Deviants, mutated Eternals, physically ugly, and their sworn enemies, whom the Eternals protect humanity from. Over time, Kirby's characters were integrated into the Marvel continuity, with some members serving with The Avengers.Kirby had a great knack for writing epic space opera stories, as evidence by his work with Stan Lee on the early FANTASTIC FOUR series, and later with the NEW GODS over at DC Comics, a series filled with heroes and villains possessing God like powers. Jack Kirby was a genius in conveying the grandeur and the power of such sagas on the comic page, but film, on the other hand, has often in the past, proved not up to the task of translating stories filled with these incredibly powerful beings to the screen; as evidence I site what happened with Galactus (a creation of Kirby) in that FANTASTIC FOUR movie. On that matter, I do think the ETERNALS got it right, doing justice to the legacy of King Kirby, and giving us a film that is entertaining, though not without flaws, and one which pushes the MCU in a new direction, one that seems to draw back upon Marvel comics of the '70s, which any long time fan can tell you, was filled with a lot of craziness, and I don't mean that as criticism.At its heart, the ETERNALS, like the X-Men and The Avengers, is the story of a family, a group of siblings who must decide if they will bend to their parents' will, or decide what is right for themselves, and the humans they have come to care for so much. This family consists of: Selma Hayak as their leader Ajak, the only one capable of communicating with the Celestials; Ikaris, played by Richard Madden, who shoots laser beams from his eyes, and has the gift of flight; Sersi, played by Gemma Chan, who can transmute matter into any material she chooses; Kingo, played by Kumail Nanjaini, who can shoot deadly energy beams from his hands; Gilgamesh, played by Don Lee (who was everyone's favorite character in TRAIN TO BUSAN) who possesses super strength that rivals Thor and The Hulk; Sprite, played by Lia McHugh, a child who can create illusions; Druig, played by Barry Keoghan, who has the power of telepathy and mind control; Makkari; played by deaf actress Lauren Ridloff, who has super speed; Phastos, played by Brian Tyree Henry, a technological genius; and Thena, portrayed by Angelina Jolie, a warrior who uses energy to create weapons. Of this large group, it is former lovers Chan and Madden who get the most screen time, evening sharing the MCU's first PG-13 sex scene, but most to the others have their moments as well, and I think the film does a decent job of getting us invested with these characters. The story hues very close to the three act arc of most Marvel films: the first act establishes who is who among the Eternals with their arrival on Earth 7,000 years ago to save prehistoric humanity from the Deviants, we learn their powers, conflicts and tensions and what ultimately scattered them across the globe up to the present with the re-emergence of the Deviants post Thanos/Endgame; the second act concerns the reuniting of the team, where some members like Chan and Henry have assimilated themselves well among humans, while others, like Madden and Keoghan have kept their distance, in the face of the renewed threat from the Deviants, ending in a jungle confrontation and battle where there are casualties, and the hidden truth about the Celestials is revealed; setting the stage for the third act where the Eternals must square off against their creators for the sake to the planet and people they have come to love. The finale has betrayals and the requisite battle where everything is at stake and the heroes are pushed to the wall, seemingly with no chance of victory until...I found a lot to like in this movie, despite its flaws, which include an opening act very heavy with exposition and time jumps, as there is a lot to learn in a short time. The nominal villains, the Deviants, are introduced in the first half, and factor heavily in the story only to all but disappear as a threat in the second half when their leader is dispatched by Jolie; some characters don't get near enough screen time, like the very talented Ridloff. Some of the humor works, some of it doesn't; this is not GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. What really works is the casting, which is spot on, especially Jolie, Lee, and Keoghan; Chan is excellent in what amounts to the lead role, she might be my new favorite MCU heroine. Nanjaini really stands out as an immortal who has found a home as a Bollywood star. This might be the most gorgeous looking MCU film ever, as Zhao did a lot of location filming in places like the Canary Islands. The effects do their job, and the sequence where the Dreaming Celestial partially rises from the earth is proof that this film has truly captured Kirby original vision. At over two and a half hours, ETERNALS is long, but for me, it went by fast. Marvel and Disney clearly took a risk by making a film built around what to many fans are definitely obscure heroes, but they pulled it off, and making it clear that the MCU is not afraid to move into uncharted territory going forward, that it doesn't need Steve Rogers and Tony Stark to make compelling movies.And speaking of the future, there are a couple of end credits scenes that raise the stakes nicely: welcome to the MCU Harry Styles and Kit Harrington.",Eternals
57,hunter-friesen,Another cog in the Marvel machine,6,5 November 2021,"How is it that Chloé Zhao's previous film ""Nomadland,"" about a woman wandering the Midwest in a van, is more interesting and full of life than a $200 million blockbuster filled with literal gods?Both a coincidence and not a coincidence, ""Eternals"" and ""Dune"" share the same release window and many of the same elements. Both are technically well-crafted and beautiful films done on an epic scale featuring diversely interesting casts. Both cover vast amounts of space and time in attempts at worldbuilding for future sequels. And both share an emptiness on the page that keeps them from surviving anywhere past their runtimes. It's a shame that prestigious filmmakers like Chloé Zhao and Denis Villeneuve chose to make their least interesting films at the same time.But before I reveal my hand too early, let's back things up to the beginning of time, literally. ""In the beginning...,"" reads the opening crawl, a Celestial by the name of Arishem created the universe and all living things that inhabit it. Like the story in the Bible, this god was not perfect, as he created a monstrous race known as the ""Deviants"" that threatened the natural order of life. To right his wrong, Arishem created the ""Eternals"" to wipe out the Deviants and bring peace. For 7,000 years the Eternals have been Earth's watchful protectors, subtly guiding humanity to what it is today.But Arishem's imperfection begins to sow seeds of doubt within the Eternals. That doubt leads them to discover the real reason they have been dispatched to this planet, which is to prepare it for the ""emergence"" that would bring about the end of humanity. Do the Eternals go against their maker by preventing his grand plan, or do they sacrifice billions for the idea of the greater good?Just on paper, ""Eternals"" is Marvel's biggest feature to date in terms of scope and possibility. About a dozen new characters are introduced, all with unique powers. There's one with super speed, one that can control minds, and another that flies around and shoots laser beams out of his eyes like Superman (a reference made more times than you would think within the film).Marvel has always had a gift when it comes to casting their famed superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. Being cast as Iron Man was seen as an unnecessary gamble, and more eyebrows were raised when unknowns Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston were cast as Thor and Loki, respectively. Just two months ago, Simu Liu proved all the doubters wrong with his terrific turn as Shang-Chi.But while all those risks have paid off, this large bet doesn't bring back the expected return on investment. A few names, like Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and Angelina Jolie are either miscast or not good enough for their roles. And for those that are good, such as Gemma Chan as Sersi and Richard Madden as Ikaris, their characters are too flat to inspire anything memorable about them except their names and what powers they have.But there are a few wins within this cast that should be championed, such as the first hearing-impaired superhero in Makkari, and the first openly gay couple in Phastos and Ben. There's also the first Marvel sex scene, lasting all of eight seconds. While celebration should be in order, these inclusionary acts are still baby steps for the Mouse House, who have always embodied the urban dictionary term of ""passive progressive.""""Eternals"" is also the most interesting Marvel movie on a purely technical level. That's not to say it's the best, but that it's different in a refreshing way. Zhao, newly armed with Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture, makes the most radical departure from the plastic formula that has engulfed this franchise for the better part of its life. Along with DP Ben Davis (who also shot the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" as well as ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Captain Marvel"") Zhao leans for a desaturated, naturalistic look, similar to that of her previous features. The plains of South Dakota and the jungles of the Amazon are filled with beauty as she always seems to find and harness the magic hourBut those moments of visual originality are brief and sporadic. Once the special effects and action set pieces inevitably barge their back way in, it's back to business as usual.This bait-and-switch act begs the question: If even the most independent-minded filmmaker like Zhao can't break free from the corporate chains, who can? It's a question that I don't want to think about, as the answer is the one I fear the most: nobody can. That gloominess I feel may not be shared by those that have stayed loyal to this rewarding franchise. For those that came into this clinging on to the last bits of hope that someone could shake things up, this movie may very well be the death knell to that. But at the end of the day, did I truly expect anything different in Marvel's 26th entry?",Eternals
58,Come-and-Review,"Not the worst MCU film, neither the best",7,7 November 2021,"The answer to the question that most are asking, following the huge internet buzz that resulted from the release of critics ratings, is this: it is definitely far from being the worst MCU film, but as a MCU film, it's not the most memorable one, even if, thanks to Zhao, visually and storyline-wise it is one of the most distinct Marvel films.Zhao's film balances rather safely between being a film belonging to the MCU system and being a Zhao film. There are minor elements of Zhao's cinematic poetics that permain. Even if Zhao's touch is palpable, what prevails is the dimension of the film as a MCU film.In an almost unprecedented fashion, Eternals is non-linear in its story structure, one of its many perks. The issue in the first 40 minutes of the movie is that the flashback scenes prove to be more interesting than the main storyline. It feels almost as if this parallel storyline could have been expanded in a more interesting full feature film. Eventually, threads are connected and the non-linear structure becomes interconnected enough to justify the unification of the subjects in one single film, but the ""present day"" storyline lacks coherence in some aspects.Ultimately, the biggest issue of Eternals is inherently linked to it being an MCU film. The Marvel signature approach, that demystifies superhero characters and turns them into comic figures, flawed and human, hardly works well for a set of god-like entities with millenary lifespan that have guided the early evolution of mankind, such as the Eternals.In terms of MCU lore, Eternals brought forward a vast area of expansion, that if implemented well, might possibly lead to new directions for the franchise. Weighing the pros and cons, Eternals leans more towards the postive, but its flaws prevents it from utmost greatness.(full review on comeandreview)",Eternals

60,thepriceofpayne,This Film lasts for an Eternity,7,6 November 2021,"Marvel's latest entry to the MCU feels very self contained, and allow for Chloe Zhao to work with a large budget using her beautiful affinity for landscapes and nature at a large scale. The films story, plot, characters, and performances are all phenomenal the only issue with it is there's too much, and it's our first time with any of these people. For a film like ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" which also contains a lot but we've seen them before and the stakes are quite low it's an easier ride. With this film, it's the first time many of these actors, characters, writers, and filmmakers have entered the MCU and while it's without a doubt thrilling and fun, the movie feels it's length and can leave some unfamiliar with the Eternals feeling bored (however I was ecstatic.) I'm excited to see where these characters go in the future and I hope Chloe Zhao is invited back to the table to tell another chapter, as I feel she has some ownership over these characters much like James Gunn to the Guardians. I almost wish the film were told in two parts as it is very similar to Dune in some ways, but take what we can get. Is this the worst of the MCU not by a long shot and it's crazy to see the Rotten score after viewing it, but I can't say I don't understand where some are coming from.

66,fraser-simons,Perfect Phase 4 Opening,9,5 November 2021,"I went in expecting an alright film and came out ranking this among my top 5 Marvel films quite highly. There's a lot of strengths this movie has:The script is legitimately excellent for a few reasons. It takes its time introducing the characters-I could have done with even more in this respect, especially with a couple of them. I was always engaged and genuinely curious.The writer understands multi-level stakes, which most super heroes simply do not nail at all. The consequences feel artificial and the action perfunctory. Not so here. Why? Because along with that the conflicts are all multilayered as well. There is not ""one side"" that's good and the participating characters all have far more nuanced beliefs and drives when it enters the climax.The story is simply written well at a craft level. It only gets more interesting and the implications of the result are super interesting and perfectly usher in Phase 4.The direction is great. Shot composition is excellent. Cinematography is phenomenal at some points. Amazing CGI. Very cool conceptually-far more interesting than most super hero movies (which I've seen all of them).I thought a couple scenes could breath more, and like I said, a few of the introductions feel slightly rushed. Then, one or two jokes don't land. Which is normal for me. Surprisingly, some did. Weird ones. So I'd call that even.Overall, this is exactly what Marvel movies needed. This is an intelligent script. It succeeds as a superhero film but also as a science fiction film, too. It's exciting and made me care about where this kinds of films are going, because they're becoming a bit workmanlike and overproduced. What a breath of fresh air.",Eternals

69,residentgrigo,Diet Coke Zack Snyder,6,4 November 2021,"I hate to say it but critics were right. Eternals isn´t like the comics (who cares) and not the worst MCU film but still towards the bottom. Basically Dune 2021 x what critics accuse MoS of being. Cut 25 minutes, loose the random remnants of MCU ""humor"" and the forced exposition, give the cast and Deviants more intriguing looks, give the Deviants more scenes where they aren´t CGI rage monsters and there would have been something here. Neil Gainman failed to give this IP a hook in the 00s and the same goes for its creator Jack Kirby in the 80s so I´ll continue waiting for a New Gods show or movie. Especially if Zack Snyder´s take is used who has a similar approach to Chloé Zhao when it comes to Supergods. Zhao pulls her punches though, unlike him. Snyder´s controversial vision found a mass audience in the end. I can´t see that here and the Disney producers are already doing damage control in the press.The Eternals is almost a good movie. Almost. I can see a semi-sequel working so don´t fully pull the plug yet Feige as this isn´t a second Inhumans.",Eternals

71,gabethedinosaur,Eternals is a remarkable 2021 marvel movie,10,5 November 2021,The storytelling is incredible . The actors and actresses were so well done . Angelina and Selma were the right ladies for marvel .

Marvel have become a people pleasing soulless mess. 3 films on the spin to either be awful or boring. There's nothing fresh here, some ideas that seem like theft... the deaf flash?Average film with poor casting, played out effects, bland characters, slow meandering story.",Eternals
73,drawlife,"Respect, but mixed.",6,7 November 2021,"Lots to digest. Very dense indeed and very much a mixed bag.VFX is top notch the Celestials are cool. The Deviants were a big issue in the film. The film had a ""OH LOOK A MONSTER! LETS KILL IT!"" kind of approach to it. When it's revealed that they got some motive, it's very abrupt and executed without too much thought. I can somewhat forgive this as the film has to juggle ten characters, so I did expect the villains to be an afterthought, but they could have been more.The cast is pretty good, director Chloe Zhao and the writers do a good job balancing the entire cast. Not one of them felt left out, and to their best abilities try to develop them properly. Here are my stand-outs:Don Lee (Ma Dong-seok) as Gilgamesh gets a shoutout as the first Korean superhero on screen. Yes, this is because I'm Korean. Also I liked the banter he had with Angelina Jolie's Thena. It was the only relationship between the team where I felt it came off a bit more genuine than most.Richard Madden as Ikaris does a good job playing it straight without it feeling boring. The entire time he's on screen, you get the sense that something is on his mind and it makes you wonder what he's thinking.Lia McHugh as Sprite also impressed me as she is basically an Eternal who physically looks young, but Lia as a young actor does a great job portraying Sprite as if she is a bitter old soul.Barry Koeghan as Druig also impressed me. The film also plays with the idea if he's either on the side of good or bad.I respect the MCU's bold move to swing big. I can see what their approach to this film was. It reminded me of Ridley Scott's PROMETHEUS, but instead of the perspective of the humans, we get it in the perspective of the engineers(or in this case, the Eternals).I'm going to sound somewhat hypocritical, as I do appreciate that they tried to be different and made big swings with a lot of high concepts and some thought provoking ideals, but at the end of the day it all felt pretentious and overly sentimental with some syrupy moments throughout.Lots of exposition too. ALSO, the plot felt very similar, if not almost identical to GOTG VOL. 2. It kinda felt as if they were disregarding what happened, but let me remind you that Ego the living planet in VOL. 2 played by Kurt Russell is a Celestial and Star-Lord inherited some of those gifts, which explains why he held on to an infinity stone and didn't die.In conclusion, I found myself thinking throughout the film ""wow they're going in this direction, this is cool and I love and respect these choices"" but it is ultimately weighted down by its structural flaws, bland villains, some twists you can see coming a mile away, and its overly sentimental tone.6/10.",Eternals
74,Benslie,A breath of fresh air for the MCU but not perfect,9,7 November 2021,"One of the best things about this movie is the gorgeous cinematography. I feel like what helped in this department was how you can tell they always tried to film on location instead of in a studio so they could easily get natural lighting instead of needing to use studio lighting. I feel like we all need to thank Chole Zhao, who directed and co-wrote this movie, for choosing to film on location and giving us that great cinematography. Chole Zhao also did a great job bringing her unique directing style to the MCU which helped make this movie stand out from the others with it not following the beat-for-beat Marvel formula. This is easily one of the most original Marvel movies to date so far but I will say that despite that the story for this movie is lacking. This movie is very much a more character-driven story in comparison to the other Marvel movies that are action-driven and because of that I just never felt myself getting fully hooked. Not to say the characters are bad when in reality it's far from that but I was always waiting for the story to speed up. I feel like my biggest issue wasn't the story but the pacing and how unfortunately it affected the story. This entire movie felt like the first part of a two-part series where it was building up the characters before a big fight in the next movie so when the ending happened, I was surprised. The best way to explain the pacing of this movie is up until the ending the movie is slow but once the ending happens it goes at the right speed. I will say that the action scenes in this movie were really well done and felt like something we haven't seen yet in the MCU. Another big surprise for me was the special effects in this movie and just how they looked pretty well done throughout the entire movie. The characters in this movie definitely weren't the worst part of this movie since despite the story not fully giving them much all of the actors gave it they're all in this movie. My personal favourite actor in this movie was Lia McHugh, who plays Sprite, because despite being so young in this movie, she still was able to bring real emotions to her character both serious and comedic. I also really enjoyed Lauren Ridloff, who plays Makkari. The final thing I want to mention is the score, composed by Ramin Djawadi, for this movie. I enjoyed that he didn't just keep it as one type of music style but also included other styles from different cultures. In the end, Eternals is a breath of fresh air for the MCU that still has some problems but doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the film.",Eternals
75,agentsofsword,A beautiful and epic MCU movie.,10,5 November 2021,"It's just amazing and breathtaking it didn't feel like an MCU film at all.It struggles in the first act but got back on track in the 2nd and 3rd act. Ikaris and Richard Madden's performance is amazing.My fav characters are probably Ikaris , Thena and Makkari. Phastos and his husband felt natural not woke ""you're just homophobic"".Every Eternals got their moment to shine and all of them are likable.The Forest Sequence is definitely on my top 5 comic book fight scenes. I really loved it a lot and it's well done!!The visuals are top tier probably like the best looking marvel film. The deviants are op but felt generic in the third act and the main villain is just WELL DONE! The motivation, why they did what they did. The love/family are done well because it was captured perfectly.",Eternals
76,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A dense meta look at gods living amongst humans that sets itself apart from other Marvel films,8,5 November 2021,"Eternals is a dense and majestic Marvel film that deconstructs the Marvel Cinematic Universe superheroes as Greek Pantheon-like gods living amongst humans in a sprawling narrative that spans through human history. It's tonally different from any Marvel film we've gotten and takes one further step into reflecting upon what ""super"" and ""hero"" in ""superhero"" means. The closest comparison would be Zack Snyder's Justice League.Nomadland director Chloe Zhao brings a freshness that diverts from the usual Marvel formula, though its arthouse sensibilities may turn others away. The film takes its sweet time introducing ten characters of the Eternals ensemble and cross-sections through each of their respective backstories.The story explores what god-like powers mean towards helping mankind, similar to Star Trek's Prime Directive. What is the right amount of help for mankind? Does helping mankind alter their destiny? Is humankind even worth helping?There is a tinge of Terrence Malick's sensibility where the camera stares blankly into nature's void, looking for life's answers watching waves crash on the beach.It is essential to see Eternals in IMAX. Ben Davis' cinematography is breathtaking but more importantly, it is the sheer scale of the frame that lets the nature shots overwhelm and engulf the audience. The IMAX shows what it is like seeing Earth from God's point of view.This poetic search for grandeur is what I enjoyed most about Chloe Zhao's vision. Eternals takes itself more seriously than other Marvel films and seeks gravitas. There's less of that trademark Marvel ""buh dum tss"" humour, which I deeply appreciated.All the time devoted towards its grand mythic storytelling comes at the cost of developing its core love story. The relationships between the Eternals members are told more than shown and are only skin deep. This unfortunately lessens the dramatic impact that it so needs at the end.I enjoyed Chloe Zhao's ambition and appreciated the breath of fresh air. Eternals is my favourite out of the Marvel Phase 4 thus far, including the recent Disney Plus shows. It's not for everybody and commercially-minded audiences may lose patience with it and it will most likely fly over kids' heads.Usually at the end of every Marvel film, I am long accustomed to feeling, ""That was fun but didn't really hang together. I guess they'll fix it in the sequel."" With Eternals, I wanted something more from it. It was so close to sticking that landing. So close.",Eternals
77,jebyvyson,It was...okay.,6,7 November 2021,"As much as I like the MCU, they're beginning to feel a bit flat for me and this movie proves it. It feels like a different type of movie that isn't Marvel which makes it interesting. But since this is a Marvel movie, they used old tropes and clichés we've seen dozens of times in the MCU which gets annoying. Visually, the movie looks good and the style is magnificent. What I do enjoy is that it is getting ready for something big in future movies, but the movie as a whole was slow and sometimes some parts that were questioning for interested becomes something not all that exciting.",Eternals
78,seige-hound,"Amazing visuals, mediocre editing, confusing story",6,4 November 2021,"While I wouldn't say that Eternals deserves to be the lowest rated MCU movie (My personal pick for worst MCU film is Thor The Dark World), there are glaring issues with the plot, editing and pacing of the film that should have been addressed.Eternals is about Eternals, a race of immortal superheroes with various powers who are put on Earth to fight off Deviants, a type of generic monster. Their powers come from the Celestials, godlike creatures that create stars and galaxies from scratch, who instructed the Eternals to help the humans fight off Deviants, but otherwise not interfere with human politics and war.A very clever little way of dodging the obvious questions of ""Why didn't they help the Avengers fight Thanos?"", but not clever enough to answer other questions like ""Where are the other numerous superheroes of the MCU during the events of this film?""I had the same problem with Shang Chi, but Shang Chi had the benefit of having a much more small scale and personal story, but Eternals is by design a massive story to tell in just one movie, and I don't think it quite delivers.I will give some compliments. Visually the film is stunning, the director Chloe Zhao, recently receiving several awards for her previous film Nomadland, shows off her talent for cinematography. Both the visual effects and nature photography are standouts, making this a high contender for best looking MCU movie, among the likes of Ragnarok and Doctor Strange. The characters and performances are overall great, some better than others. I loved the main character Sersi, her powers were cool and I found her very likeable. Eternals also deserves praise for having the first gay kiss in an MCU movie, although still made in such a way that they can cut it out of the film for certain audiences. The powers of the characters are overall pretty great and unique in terms of the MCU.Overall I think this film was fun but flawed. It does deserve criticism, and the editing was pretty bad at parts, but it doesn't deserve to be the lowest rated MCU movie. I hope that the MCU producers learn from their mistakes in this film and improve for upcoming projects with these characters.",Eternals
79,carolrmag,Disappointed,5,7 November 2021,"To begin with I believe it is important to clear one thing: I am a marvel big fan.As always, the movie is very well done so you won't be dissapointed with the special effects, etc.Perhaps because of the introduction of so many characters at once was what made it fail for me. I didn't like every character and even those I did connect with it was in an almost supperficial way.The storyline is completely different from other marvel films. Another set of beings. The good guys might be bad. This part could be refreshing but I didn't feel it.Please someone tell actors to stop freezing their faces (won't mention wich). It is bad for the movies and probably for themselves. We have seen extraterrestial characters more expressive than some actors that go down this road.I hope movies that will follow will make up for this one, wich felt like a very long introduction. I missed the LOLs all other marvel films give us, mixed with drama and adventure.All in all, I'd say this movie failed in the above mentioned features I'd expect to encounter.",Eternals
80,robinsonaustin-07490,Loss for Words,5,7 November 2021,"So...I did come out of the movie mixed. I don't completely love or hate the movie. For some positives, I did appreciate that the producers were willing to take a risk with this film as it greatly deviates from the standard formula for the MCU.I did like the expanded world-building to the lore with learning more about the Celestials. On a cinematographic level, the visuals; creature designs; and action sequences were good. So, a well-crafted movie.As much as I could admire their risks with changing the formula, they probably went too far. The film suffers considerably from exposition dumps making the pacing laborious to get through. Its 2-hour runtime further undermines it because there isn't much there to keep you invested.As a more ""serious "" take on an MCU film, there is not much in the way of humor and even when there is, it's too dry and conflicts with the tone.The introduction of the Eternals also presents issues. For instance, if they were around for thousands of years, then why did they do nothing to stop Thanos in IW? Sure, the film does try to say they couldn't get involved with affairs unless the deviants were in the equation. But...considering the fact that the Blip created the right circumstances for a Celestial to emerge, it feels counterproductive to just have the Mad Titan succeed since it would hinder the chances of the emergence from happening.The team themselves. None stood out as interesting and were underdeveloped. Sure, some had their own personalities and quirks, they mostly fell under the generic character types like: the Leader; the Smart Guy; the Muscle, etc.While the film does have moments where the characters have some ""hidden depths,"" at best they are just informed attributes. The issue more seems that they could not decide which Eternal to focus on due to there being too many. Not helping that some characters make complete 180s with little reason.But, ultimately, Eternals is a mixed bag. While not the absolute worst of the MCU films, it does seem that the writers were at a loss on how to convey the story.I just felt empty after watching it.",Eternals
81,sujanfaster,Guardians of the Galaxy (Incognito),8,8 November 2021,"Eternals is MARVEL's much anticipated ensemble movie post The Avengers saga. It is a part of phase 4 of the MARVEL cinematic universe and was released with high anticipation. It has been receiving a lot of mixed reviews but somehow I liked it and to my surprise I liked it better than Shang Chi. Eternal's may not be the perfect MARVEL movie, but it does have pretty much all the classic MARVEL characteristics.While the main plot of the Eternals occurs in the post 'blip' MARVEL era, it also connects to some of the major historic events of human civilization. Some of the mythological references to the characters work well. But the difficult part is to introduce another set of superheroes doing the same things as Avengers. The story tries to explain why they were not involved in the previous battles on earth, but it is just not convincing enough. Eternals suffers from the lack of character introduction just like DC's Justice League a few years ago. There are too many things thrown at you at once and for most of the film I didn't even realize how many Eternals there were forget about what their superpowers are. I believe Eternals would have worked better as a separate universe in itself like Xmen. Apart from a few, most of the characters lack chemistry between them.Despite the above criticism, Eternals manages to entertain somehow thanks to Kumail Nanjiani and Bryan Tyree Henry's comic timing. The director has made full use of Nanjiani's comedy background and also South Asian heritage. There are many scenes aimed at pleasing the Indian audience and they work well. Of course there is forced diversity at times, but that is how the future looks like for the big movie studios. Richard Madden and Gemma Chan as Sersi do a decent job but I personally didn't feel so emotionally connected to them as the leaders of the pack. Angelina Jolie's character loses itself in the mysterious vibe created around her. Ma Dong-seok and Lauren Ridloff are pretty impressive. Harish Patel's role is a pleasant surprise to all the Indian audience out there. Although Kit Harrington barely gets any screen time in this movie, I believe he will get more in the upcoming ones.Eternals may be a forced addition to the MARVEL's universe but it is thoroughly entertaining and I hope it does get better from now on.",Eternals
82,shaikhirshad-41223,Outstanding Visuals but lacks story....,6,6 November 2021,"Eternals are is quite different from any other marvel movie. From it's story to it's characterisation all are different from the other movies. Good points of this movie is it's OUTSTANDING VISUALS and the film looks very beautiful to watch from it's set designing to the eternal costumes all look fascinating. Then the mighty cast is so perfect to watch that it'll made your day. Then comes the action sequences which is good but it can be better. Bad points starts from it's Storyline, Director should've more focused on the storyline rather than the conversation and emotional connection of the characters. Screenplay is not so good because in the mid of the movie you feel bored with the conversations that the characters having in the movie. The movie is also slow paced which is good for the character building but not good for the mcu movie. Apart from this movie can definitely cut to 10-20 mins because so much conversation and group connection won't be required as much as in the movie. Rest of it all good you can definitely watch one time with it's beautiful vfx, star cast and the action sequences...",Eternals
83,mmevanille-53097,Its a pretty decent film but...,7,4 November 2021,"As there are ten new heroes to introduce, it does not allow enough screen time to introduce the audience to all of them properly, which leads to people not really feeling connected with the characters due to lack of this characterization.Its a problem with all team based hero movies to some extent. Avengers were fine as mostly they were introduced with their own films. Guardians worked because it revolved around Starlord as a primary character and the other characters were sort of introduced in the periphery. But the Eternals tries to introduce them all in one go, and give a small piece of development before the action sequences, so you don't really get time to learn them and feel for their character.But apart from that its a pretty generic film, writing wise. It does have more of a DC vibe to it than most Marvel films. Good CGI, decent performances, but character development was off which lead to a somewhat disinterested viewing.",Eternals
84,Dottsylove,Look forward to future iterations with a more Metropolitan experience,6,5 November 2021,A good story and a good set up for future films. Not great mind you.

Containing at least three full comic books of origin stories for the ten main eternals, this film should be watched like it were an appetiser. The main meal will be tremendous, judging by this pre-emptive smorgasbord of powers!Not Gods, yet named as some. Not universally renowned, yet they had been there done that. Not evil, yet not good, either. These new kind of heroes only fight one kind of enemy and avoid interfering in human conflict, even though their touch can be traced throughout written history (their names a big clue).Their battle is akin to humans' plight with religion. And metaphors aplenty can be gleaned from a view!I, personally, cannot wait until I own it on a disc to re-watch as many times I need to discover the many levels of comprehension doted within!

Fighting scenes with Deviants have solid action and all the movie was interesting to follow. Best role award goes to Gemma Chan.",Eternals
87,~AleXa~,"Strong storytelling, stunning visuals, and exceptional acting slightly encumbered by poor location choices, overuse of effects, and inconsistent pacing",8,8 November 2021,"Eternals (2021) is certainly one of the more obscure Marvel comics with content that is both highly artistic and aesthetically appealing, and yet it contains a broad-scope narrative that is difficult to present cinematically, largely due to the vast history and individuality of each of the characters.Directed by Academy Award-winning director Chloe Zhao, the film follows the saga of the Eternals, an immortal race of beings sent to the Earth thousands of years ago to protect humans from an apex predator race known as Deviants. The ensemble cast includes Gemma Chan as Sersi, Richard Madden as Ikarus, Academy Award-winner Angelina Jolie as Thena, Salma Hayek as Ajak, Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, Lia McHugh as Sprite, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, Lauren Ridloff of ""The Walking Dead"" fame as Makkari, Barry Keoghan as Druig, and Ma Dong-seok (not to be confused with Benedict Wong from Doctor Strange (2016)) as Gilgamesh. The diversity and accolades of this all-star cast certainly sets Zhao with immense star power to work with.With so many important themes to touch on, from loss of love, betrayal, the good and the bad of technological advancement, and the destructive nature of humanity, it is no wonder the characters get lost in the shuffle. Some are more developed than others, such as Thena (Angelina Jolie), who suffers from a neurological condition resulting from the pain of all she has endured through the centuries. Jolie plays with this arc methodically, generating more emotion and connection than the rest of her counterparts. While a lot of time is spent focusing on the connection that Icarus and Sersi developed over the ages, ultimately falling in love, there is just no chemistry between the two. Each Eternal in their own way forges connections to humanity, relating to them in an unexpected way. The execution of the themes throughout time across various cultures and man-made disasters shines a light on humanity's failures in the hope that we may learn from them and not repeat them. Many of these sequences were poignant and tear-jerking that organically generates self-reflection without the audience feeling preached to.The flashback sequences that have the Eternals present throughout various important falls in civilization in history are fascinating in and of themselves, and had Marvel's strict timeline allowed for it, would have made an interesting enough prequel/origin story film in their own right. From Mesopatamia in 7000 BC to ancient Babylon in 1500 AD to Teotihuacan to the Gupta empire in 400 AD to the fall of the Aztecs in 1521 AD, these glimpses into fascinating historical times offers intrigue and social commentary on the folly of man. However, these iconic visuals perhaps set the modern-day sequences up to be decidedly more lackluster. The action of the fight sequences with the Deviants balances this out for the most part, however the pacing suffers from longer dramatic sequences in between.Despite the perhaps overzealous runtime of over two and a half hours, the characters still somehow feel underdeveloped. Icarus and Sersi lack any discernible heat or passion. Juxtaposed with such iconic on-screen romances that pulled heartstrings from the moment they met each other. Examples of this include Rick and Evie from Stephen Sommers' 1999 The Mummy, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere in Pretty Woman (1990) and Runaway Bride (1999), Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly in Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), and Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Each leading actor does well to portray their respective character's personalities, beliefs, strengths and weaknesses, however there's still a latent undertone of something lacking-an inability to truly be invested in them, individually or collectively, with the exception of Thena-a testament to Angelina's particular set of skills.And then there's the elephant in the room... Critics and audiences alike have praised or detested the incorporation of Marvel's first established on-screen openly gay couple, citing a variety of political correctness and the like. In all honesty, it neither detracts nor enhances the story only insofar as to give Phastos more reason to be invested in the fate of humanity. It was tastefully and naturally done-no reason to get in an uproar about it.Ramin Djawadi's score had no presence nor voracity, to the point that it was almost undetectable. Not to mention the first end-credits song is incredibly mismatched tonally. The amazing visual effects offered the Deviants truly predatory movement that made them both menacing and intriguing, and yet on the heels of Denis Villeneuve's Dune (2021), the visual landscapes suffered from the lack of filming on-location in nearly half of the sequences. For example, neither the 'Australia' nor the 'Amazon' sequences were shot in those respective locales, and in consideration of Marvel's generous $165 million Blockbuster budget, this just seems inexcusable.With all that being said, the film is most certainly not the dull dud most critics and reviewers are making it out to be. The themes are equally strong and dark, Zhao clearly unafraid to stand up on her soapbox and make a statement, asking audiences to reflect upon our own existence and an examination of what is truly important. The acting talent is exceptional, with Angelina turning in the strongest performance, generating some intense emotions. And as usual, the marketing team did the production a disservice incorporating most of the funny moments in the final trailer. It sets the audience up for disappointment when they go in expecting a different tone, not to mention considering this chronologically follows Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021), which can easily be classified as a comedy in its own right. There are some lingering questions that follow the big reveal, but for the sake of not spoiling the third act, we'll skip those for now.FINAL VERDICT: While Eternals excels at storytelling, stunning visuals, and superior direction and acting, it remains too underdeveloped and sporadically paced to justify its runtime. Despite this, it is still thoroughly entertaining and does not feel as though it is nearly three hours. Definitely worth an IMAX viewing if you will go in with an open mind. And I shouldn't have to say this 26-films in, but STAY UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS.And one last thing... For those of you who complained that Marvel films are too formulaic (just not true), and then complained about this film not being like other Marvel films... Perhaps you should reevaluate whether you have the ability to form an objective opinion, or consider maybe you're just an obsessive contrarian who is looking for a reason to complain.7.5 (8) = 1.5,1,1,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,1,1 - Rewatch Value: 5 (of 10)

93,harry-34518,Yeah the critics got this wrong,8,5 November 2021,"This film is no masterpiece some of the dialogue was messy and the story was a bit too crowded. But this film has a heart and a feeling marvel has never really had this film was beautiful from shot to shot. The acting was great. The finale was amazing visually stunning, Chloe's visuals are so apparent here it's just stunning. There is one sequence with the celestials where I just went wow. The first act is a bit of a mess but the second to third really was great.",Eternals
94,harry-34518,Not as bad as critics say,8,5 November 2021,This film is amazing it has its problems but overall it's a great watch. Every shot is done with love and care all the acting is great the story works well apart from a few points. The first act is a mess but past that point it's great.,Eternals
95,harry-34518,I really loved this film! But I see it has problems,8,6 November 2021,"Firstly I just want to say this film is really well shot, acted and directed. However the story is a bit messy the first act is too fast the seconds a bit slow but it all comes together for the third which i really enjoyed. Several times in this film I just thought wow that looks amazing. I've seen alot of critics saying this film has no heart or life, this film has a heart and it is very much alive in every way. All of the characters are really intresting and none feel under developed.This film is getting so much uneeded hate yes it has problems but it's not one star worthy. The critics have been so vague about why they hate it some just saying it's too woke. Any form of diversity in this film is natural and not forced.Overall, If you're a marvel fan and want to go to the cinema this is a must see. If you're indifferent about it can wait for dinsey plus I love this film and is one of my favourite marvel films but I can fully see why some dislike it.My personalfan rating 9.5/10
more critical rating 8/10.",Eternals

Keeps the movie rolling perfectly as it switches from story, current and history and mixing in the action well.Good performances, excellent writing, sincere acting.Was a little strange to see the 2 brothers from GoT both courting a girl named Cersi (ok spelling a little different, but pronounced the same).The MCU is still in very good hands.",Eternals
97,Bek204,"IS THIS A ""MARVEL STUDIOUS"" FILM????!",6,7 November 2021,"Eternals (2021) absolutely failed in presenting and introducing this beautiful story and characters/superheroes of Eternals in a way that would be entertaining and enjoyable to not just the MCU fans but to everyone. There is not one person to blame because the film is bad in nearly every aspect. Like, the editing, the music score, and surprisingly the acting which is shocking when you look at the cast and big names that the film has.There are many other ways to introduce and tell the story of the film that are not used well and the film doesn't take advantage of the beautiful story that Eternals have, because Eternals with its many characters/superheroes and the cast chosen to portray these superheroes have a unique and entraining story that can entrain anyone and everyone. So, why ruin such a beautiful story like that? Why not take advantage of these sources and apply them well to the film to present an entertaining film?.There is no way the script and dialogues are written by an academy award winner. They are very ""cringe"", cheap, and cheezy. The film is full of long, unorganized, unnecessary, and meaningful pusses and silences. The opening scene Is very bad and no film would want to start off the way Eternals does.The story and plot of Eternals (2021) is told in a way that would cause confusion and chaos to audience members and to the film itself by jumping right back and forth in time and it does that many times and in a way that would make you wonder what year and where are we now in the story/plot?.The acting is (surprisingly) very bad. An actor/actress should always deliver a realistic performance in which the audience doesn't feel like they are watching someone who is ""acting"". Every performance that I have seen in this film made me feel like I was watching someone who is trying to put on some fake facial expressions to play the role of their character. When a character was trying to deliver or provoke a specific emotion/feeling in the heart of audience members, they failed, because of the bad acting and portrayal. It's very shocking because there are names like Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harrington, and Richard Madden. There is only one actor who shocked me with their performance and acting that seemed more than real. They portrayed their character more than well and were able to deliver to the audience what and who this character really is and that actor is Barry Keoghan as Druig. Druig is such a mean, tough, (sometimes) cocky character that likes to make and follow his own roles. Barry Keoghan was able to play that role very well. You can see it in his facial expressions, voice tone, and body language. I don't know how the film would've been without him.I have spotted many editing mistakes that are very noticeable. For instance, in a scene where an earthquake is happening, you can tell that not every prop in the set design is moving/falling down, some were still. How can a prob be holding still and not moving at all when there is a strong earthquake that was caused because of the arrival of creates in the size of a truck?. How is that even possible or realistic?Or In one scene when a character is holding something in their hands, in the next shot, it is not there anymore.In addition, the transitions between scenes are the worst that I have seen in any film before. They are so cheap and weirdly made in a way that seems like there Is zero effort put into it. For instance, if a character is walking to enter a building, the scene transitions and does a jump cut into the character being inside the building like some kind of magic occurred. The jump cuts/transitions are also being done in such cheap and very bad way.The music is very usual. Nothing new is presented. This is weird because I thought ""Eternals"" would have their own/signature theme music the same way Iron Man or Spiderman has one. In which when you hear it you'll be able to reignite it as the theme music of ""Eternals"". Or maybe there is one but I haven't heard it. But, even if there is and the fact that is it not noticeable, means that the music department failed.The runtime is 2h 35m. This movie should've been at least 1h 50m. It's way more than enough and can easily be told in that runtime as the story is pretty simple and straightforward. In addition, the film has way too many scenes that literally mean and add nothing. It also has way too much comedy in it and in a way that would make you feel like you are watching a superhero/""comedy"" film instead of a serious superhero film. Marvel films always use comedy in every film, But it is being used way too much in Eternals (2021).My rating is: 6.5/10

98,dburris-45933,Had my doubts and gotten what I expected,5,7 November 2021,"I watched Eternals and I gotta say...it sucked 😂 now that just might mean that I have a lack of knowledge about the Eternals because I never read any of the comics about them. But the entire movie felt really slow, LOTS of reading! Oh boy...there was a LOT!! And also the acting performances were good but not great. And it was hard to connect with the characters. I'd give Eternals a 5.7 out of 10I think in my opinion, this film is definitely the weakest of the MCU.I get what they where trying to do by introducing us to new characters most people don't know, but the story direction was shaky.Visual effects where very good. HahaI would watch the movie because there was some good stuff in it. But for me it's more of a one time thing. And probably won't revisit it in the next 10 years or so.",Eternals
99,Rainbowbeany,Definitely Different,7,3 November 2021,"First of all, I'm going to have to watch this again. There is too much to unpack for just one viewing. There is so much exposition that I got confused often. Especially when bouncing between time periods. The cinematography was fantastic! The action was pretty good. Angelina Jolie was the highlight for me. Can't wait to see fight along side some Avengers. It would have a higher score if it was shorter, had better story flow, & more character balance. I mean, Kit Harrington is barely in it! Ends on a cliffhanger and shows clear direction for where they are going next. I just hope we get to see it!",Eternals

And 15 minutes of action in a 2-1/2 hour movie, rest of which is total boring. So they advertise 5 minutes of action to try to sell a real flop imo. I wasted my money to see this movie.

101,SureCommaNot,6.8/10 - A middle-tier MCU movie with a lot going for it,7,6 November 2021,"I'm hard-pressed to find anything I actively disliked about this movie, and I'm quite pleased by some risks they took.Most notably for me, they kept things on a cosmic scale for most of the story, and this was not put off-balance by the terrestrial encounters with Deviants or warring humans, nor by the development of the characters.Some viewers found the characters underdeveloped, and while I largely disagree, I also laud the film for staying more focused on ideals, cosmic themes and other abstract ideas, rather than getting bogged down by modern pressures to individualize. In terms of how much distance we feel from the characters as the overarching story is told, this feels more like The Odyssey than your typical Marvel movie, and I see that as a strength. And don't forget: this is part of a franchise; if you want more development of a particular character, remember that future films are coming. But also, why not try perceiving your own life from a grander perspective? I hope this movie stretches the viewers to rethink their own sense of their role in history.Some viewers also blasted the film for pushing the maturity level of the content, and even as a moral conservative, I have to defend the filmmakers for this choice. This movie is part of a franchise, and so it makes sense for its installments to mature as its viewers mature. The Harry Potter franchise did the same thing.One more thing I appreciated: the final film had so much less comedy than the previews led me to fear. Telling a story spanning 7000 years should have a gravitas and solemnity to it. I believe it patronizes the viewer, for a filmmaker to believe we need weighty matters broken up by laughs. We are growing up. Our movies should too.",Eternals

However, parts were confusing to follow for this reason. But not so difficult that I was still able to follow the plot.A Iong movie with alot of characters to explore. Some more than others.Good fight scenes with nothing that Marvel has not done before apart from a few different powers.I hope that the next instalment is more action orientated. The Eternals don't really need more explanation. A really compelling protagonist or other character is needed to spice things up lore-wise.",Eternals
103,huntersmithx,Does it match the ambition of its title?,8,5 November 2021,"Opening up with a Blade Runner-esque text prologue, Chloé Zhao's benefaction to the (quite eternally at this point) Marvel Cinematic Universe immediately pulls us into a beachside action set piece that establishes our colorful cast of heroes. This prologue segways into Time by Pink Floyd, the second time time the band has been utilized in the Marvel canon; and while the usage of popular classics has grown to cringe-inducing levels in the past several years, this fits both thematically and somewhat ironically. You truly feel that Time passes throughout the story as we follow ten cosmic beings who must face their destiny in saving Earth from their dastardly counterparts that resemble the aliens from A Quiet Place.It's suffice to say that the premise and first few minutes can immediately engage our audience even if the rest of the film isn't the sum of its parts. It's already apparent that Eternals may just be the most divisive MCU installment since Thor: The Dark World, but no need to worry: Eternals eclipses the latter in just about every sense. It isn't just that it brings sections of the universe full circle, it's that it utilizes Zhao's direction in its near three-hour runtime, and we can make even more sense of her overnight success from Nomadland. I was quite surprised by how much maturity has been brought to the universe, coming off the heels of Avengers: Endgame. In some ways this is a return to form to the early days of Iron Man when the creative forces that be were still trying to find their identity in the grand scheme of things, and Eternals on its own succeeded in many ways.Zhao bridges the B-movie allure of many modern super efforts (especially in its costumes) with her prestigious background- and its crowning achievement to be sung in many reviews will be Ben Davis's cinematography. What many will tell you about some of the genre hall-of fame films is where they illuminate the brightest is their ability to make you forget you're watching a superhero film, whether it'd be in writing or aesthetics. Eternals most certainly wins in the latter with its naturalistic locations, sightful evocations of isolation, storm clouds, you name it. One can most certainly believe the press notes of her influence from Terrence Malick. The battle sequences and effects are as appealing as some of Marvel's best films, and in some cases even more brutal.The Marvel Cinematic Universe may be diverse in characters and varying genres throughout the years; but none have transcended the supercapes genre like only a select few have. Sadly, even Eternals' geek roots are too obvious, and much of that comes from Marvel's usual brand of hit-and miss humor. It's understandable that in a generation of irony, many fans will want these movies breaded and buttered in self-deprecation and ""I know I'm watching a blockbuster"" mechanics; but here the results are uneven though thankfully not to Thor: The Dark World status eye-brow raising. One moment that comes close to that is during the climax and a decision with a character arc that partly amounts to a punchline.Despite some tonal deficiencies, one issue that certain critics have brought up, the runtime, is thankfully not much to differ. Instead of a breakneck speed, Zhao's direction takes its time to make every one of us care about the Eternals. So much so that a character tragedy is carefully concealed and makes way for much needed third-act tension.Like many other TV stars, Gemma Chan is one who had trouble translating her small-screen bed of roses to a silver one. Now she's played not one but two MCU characters (double-dipping in the comic book field is quite the trend amongst popular actors these days), and her turn as Sersi should be proof that she can lend herself to dramatic leads in the future. Her chemistry with Richard Madden's Ikaris is part of what makes them the ones who carry the cast on their shoulders; Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Kumail Nanjiani are all engaging and funny to varying results. Let's also not forget seasoned actresses Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie. The former makes the most of her limited screentime, and Mrs. Jolie is up there with our two leads as Thena. Fans will await for her return in a future installment.Eternals is at least half a leap forward for its respective universe in terms of maturity; a giant one in aesthetic, craftsmanship and representation; and a lateral move for Chloé Zhao's career. In a world of apples and oranges, prestigious films and blockbusters, she's another example of that you can commit to both. And let's also lay to rest the rumors of Disney bribing critics; recent Rotten Tomatoes history has showcased Dumbo, The Rise of Skywalker and Eternals- I can name more.RATING: 3 out of 4 stars.",Eternals
104,leoalexanderscott,Avengers version of Eternals,8,4 November 2021,"When I heard the Eternals were to be the next Marvel project, I was hoping for a mature television series with both serial end point and regular seasonal story arch. Exploring their influences from ape cousins through to consequences of eternals cross-breeding and in-fighting etc However, we have a movie which has been develop to fit into the Avengers phase plans. In this version, the Eternals arrived in the middle-east only 7000BC with an operative task, while acting as guardian observers, cause conflicting interpretations in the team. We are presented with a movie with a big ask to deliver lot of information in a limited amount of time. Unfortunately the dialogue becomes rushed, and for some who prefer action, some patience will be required between scenes.

Circe's kindness and her growth into a responsible leader; Ikaris's unsurmountable power and twisted values that pushed him into flames; Sprite's insecurity which nurtures her sarcasm; Thena's pride, ability, and contradicting bewilderment. With these vivacious characters, the movie's major themes are able to present flawlessly: loyalty versus love, reason of a modified being, and the essential question that are humans truly worth saving. However, the chaotic flashback to numerous historical scenes may seem epic, but it's quite repetitive and time-consuming for a superhero movie. In the end, I really hope other independent Marvel movies could be made by directors of various specialties to present us the width of university.",Eternals

108,Entertainmentsparadise,Being introduced to a new step sibling,7,6 November 2021,"I am hyped for this expansion into the Marvel universe!Eternals introduces us to a new world within the world of Marvel. At first, the number of characters left me disengaged because I didn't know who these characters were personally.I found myself fighting to like these new characters; it felt like I was being introduced to a step-sibling, unlike the previous Marvel installments where most of the characters are known and graciously established into my heart.Unfortunately, the film doesn't seem to differentiate the characters enough for me to find them too enjoyable. Although they are very diverse, I found them progressive and not forced in ethnicity, personality traits, and identities.I liked the comical relief. The action scenes were intentional, forceful, and amusing as each character has unique combat. I also felt like I had a keen sense of catching plenty of Easter eggs and references to other universes like Star Wars.The climax action scene intensified at the perfect time, fuelling my imagination toward the idea of what was to come next left. I am geeked for what is to come next.Verdict:
Eternals is an enjoyable film. It is introducing us to a whole new aspect of Marvel. Compared to some of the other marvel films **cough, cough Black Widow lol ** this fairs well. Some comedy flirts at love and sets us up for so much more to come.Does it take me to paradise? Marvel fans, I say yes!",Eternals

And the actors did well with what they were given.That is where the positives end, and it does not make up for the rest of this sloppy piece of garbage that, because it was filmed on a camera, technically qualifies as a movie.EVERY single character is half-baked at best, with backstories rushed through and motivations and desires left unclear. There are no real characters in this film...just hollow vessels who constantly change their minds and don't have any passions or traits that we can deeply understand and connect with.The most insulting aspect of this story is that the ENTIRE concept on which the story hinges does not make a single ounce of sense. It all hinges on the notion that these Eternals were created with free will and were not informed of their real purpose on Earth, even though there was NO reason for this. It completely undermines everything else that we're told through heavy exposition dumps.EVEN THOUGH THE MOVIE IS OBSESSED WITH EXPLAINING ALL OF ITS REVEALS TO YOU, THE STORY DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.Chloe Zhao is the most overrated filmmaker working today. This screenplay was written by four people, and none of them noticed the dozens of holes that the plot tear in itself over and over again.This movie offended me. It insulted my intelligence.

115,bradykitchen-33648,One of the worst MCU instalments,6,6 November 2021,"I start positive it looks phenomenal every visual detail is perfect. Humour was extremely good I laughed out loud on multiple occasions. Acting was very good no complaints there.Now here we go, please don't kill me marvel fans. I am one of you.I just think that the story telling was bad. I like the premise of the core storyline with emergence and the Ikaris turning out to be the cause of Ajaks death all that I enjoyed BUT the execution of everything else was bad.They tried to do way too much. Each character was treated like a main character which means they tried to develop 10 characters in a matter of 2.5 hours. It doesn't work, doing that doesn't allow for us to appreciate and become invested in the characters. Them not developing the characters enough made for emotional scenes that weren't actually emotional. It also made for weird executions of each characters storylines. For example Thena has roughly 15 min where she is the focus and then another 10 min to rap up her character plot line, that doesn't work we don't actually care because we only spent 20-30min with the character.Next up is the timeline. Whoever decided it would be a good idea to constantly change time periods shouldn't get another writing job. It was so bad. It was unbelievably confusing and gave us character information for characters we weren't even introduced to yet. It doesn't make sense.For the sake of length I won't say much more than that. I could pick each character apart but I don't think an IMDB review needs that.Eternals 6/10.",Eternals

Bad choices.-Salma Hayek is by far the worst actor 😆along with Gilgamesh, Don Lee.-One of the biggest problems with the script was the lack of a concerning antagonist. When presented, it absolutely lead to a dead end. No where in the film did i feel the ""eternals"" were ever in trouble. On the flip side these ""eternals"" didnt feel strong at all...mediocre.

I haven't read the source material (just got the Neil Gaiman miniseries of Eternals, will get to reading that soon), and haven't seen the director's previous Oscar-Winning film (Nomadland) or any of her previous films.And yet, despite having no expectations for Phase 4, I still think this is the most disappointing film of 2021, even more so than Black Widow.I should mention that this film tries to be different from the other films in the way that it's shot (more practical sets, shooting on location, less green screen) and honestly, it looks beautiful. I honestly want Marvel to keep going down this route.Ramin Djawadi's score is pretty good and unique and it's so nice to see Iron Man's composer reunite with the MCU. I would have preferred Alexandre Desplat but Djawadi score makes for an epic listen.The writing sucks. It's one of the most boring films I've seen; compared to Valerian and Jupiter Ascending, it's not bad but it comes really close. The characters feel one-note, they don't have that much depth to them, and they're not well developed; to the point where I can't remember a single character from this film compared to other perfect MCU Ensemble Films like Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2 or Avengers 1. This might be due to the film having too many protagonists in it. You could have cut some of them out of the film and left them for later films and nothing much would have been lost.The acting is the dullest in the entire MCU. All of the actors felt like they brought no personality or chemistry to the table whatsoever and none of their performances felt memorable; it's even worse than Brie Larson in Captain Marvel. I don't know if they were miscast, were give bad direction, were given a terrible script or all of the above but fact still remains that they were completely unnmemmorable and wasted in this film. The only ones that felt like they were at least trying were Barry Keoghan, Bryan Tyree Henry, Kit Harrington (who isn't even in the film that much), Richard Madden, Lauren Ridloff and even Bill Skarsgard (who voices Kro); these actors felt like they had emotions apart from dull surprise.The pacing is also different from the other MCU films as it's much slower and more contemplative. Unfortunately, that also harms the film unintentionally as nothing much happens in both action scenes and quieter moments. Scenes also feel like they're just stitched together with no connection to the next scene tying them together, making for some pretty bad editing.1/10 with one extra star for the visuals.

But the diversity also caused a problem, there are ten different eternals and none of them really get that big a spotlight so we never get to feel attached to them, so when one of them are lost we don't feel the emotion as much.The dialogue, more especially in the beginning of the movie is so full of hackneyed phrases and concepts, which made the rest of the movie a bit predictable to me. As expected for Marvel movies, the visuals were stellar to look at but the fight scenes didn't leave me that impressed, heard someone say they resemble video games, I don't agree but get why. And as the recent trend in MCU, they tried adding some comedy to it, not as much as the other movies but it's there. My biggest problem was it all felt a bit anticlimactic, I don't think it was boring, just quite bathetic over the 2hrs. Maybe it's because I expected that Tiamut, the new born celestial was gonna put up more of a fight but it all ended relatively quick instead. I'm not really stuck on what happened in this movie, but more about what's gonna happen in the next, feels like that's where the action is going to be and it's sorta giving me guardians of the galaxy vibes.I think as a genesis to the next chapter of marvel films, this was a great movie especially if you haven't read through the comics. It does a lot of things right and there's nothing it actually does horribly wrong. I feel like the other reviews are judging it to the extremes were it's either really terrible and dull, or calling it absolutely exquisite. I think that it just deserves a watch and the sequel will be what's gonna be either really poor or really exquisite.",Eternals
119,jditch,A Rich Marvel Comic's Fan Fest,8,6 November 2021,"A film I never thought I'd ever see happen, the Eternals! And what a fantastically refreshing Marvel film at that. It's nice to explore some of the more interesting and varied characters from the comics for once. I enjoyed that we explored so much history, viewing Earth from a very different perspective than other MCU films, refreshing for sure
. In many ways this feels like essential viewing for the hardcore marvel fans.I can't really understand the bad reviews either, Jolie puts in one of the performances of her career. Her screen presence has never been better. Chan is fantastic, so is Madden. The sets are beautiful, the CGI is as good as it gets on screen. My one criticism would be that I figured out a major twist very early on, without even trying I should add. It was a little obvious because of some of the dialogue, at least to me personally.I enjoyed some of the subtle history nods. Some are quite obvious and I would hope everyone more or less knows what is what. Others a re a little smarter and I imagine most viewers won't catch it. It'd perhaps not best aimed at children this time, personally I think it's refreshing. There is still humour but it doesn't gift you all the information. Sometimes that makes for a better film and it does here.I definitely wouldn't listen to the negative reviews. If you love sci-fi you'll love this. If you love history, this is your film. Lastly, even if you just love cinema, you'll enjoy this. It's epic and grand and I can't wait to see more of this story.",Eternals
120,azcdk,Ugh,1,8 November 2021,Terrible...watch as Disney destroys yet another classic. Terrible acting and continuity. Relying on pointless battles and CGI. Not recommended........,Eternals
121,TMAuthor,A Mistaken Direction In The MCU,3,6 November 2021,"Not recommended.First, to be clear, this isn't a slam on Chloe Zhao as a director. I really liked Nomad Land. However, putting an Oscar winning director in charge of a movie doesn't guarantee a successful film, or effective story telling. There's a long list of good directors messing up a science fiction or comic book film. This is one too.There's too much going on in this film, and too many forced story elements that don't add anything.Performances are all over the board. CGI set pieces are not handled well and the pace is very slow.A big part of the problem is that the Eternals were never a hugely successful title in comics. Very niche. This required a lot of exposition, not just because they aren't mainstream, but because there are so many characters in this film. It bogs down the movie.Fanboys and Fangirls who enjoy films like Fast and Furious, Transformers and the like will probably give this high marks. That is their right.However, professional reviewers and connoisseurs of sci fi/comic treatments will give this a solid C or C-.On to the next MCU film...Spider-Man No Way Home, which will hopefully be as entertaining as the first two Tom Holland spidey flicks.",Eternals
122,moviematthewh-60783,Hit and miss,6,3 November 2021,"Clearly this film is taking a different approach than what we normally see in a MCU film. The themes are much more dark and carry more emotional weight with them. Chloe Zhao's direction while I thought was great in this film and kept to her style, I just don't think it might fit in the MCU thought. It seems out of place almost because of how different this story is delivered. The story was also a bit messy I thought, with the time jumps going back and forward making it confusing to tie loose ends. And it was also a weak story might I add, because I felt that there wasn't much excitement happening in the film, especially during the second act. There wasn't much development with many of the eternals, as it's too hard for a 2 1/2 hour film to develop 10+ characters deep enough for audiences to feel some sort of emotion towards them. Performances and visuals were stunning though, very good looking film on the big screen. Dolby atmos surround sound delivers also adding immersive experience while watching. The action was a bit light I thought, but the scenes we get are again great visually and choreographed well. The final battle was a bit underwhelming I thought also. It would of worked better as a TV series maybe, but then the visual aspects would be under appreciated if seen on a TV and not a giant imax screen. But this film still adds more clues as to what may happen in the future of the MCU.",Eternals
123,JoelAlexanderr,A visually stunning triumph that goes thematically deeper than any Marvel film thus far,9,9 November 2021,"I have never been more disappointed leaving a movie than I was leaving ETERNALS. Not because of the movie -- in fact, it was because the movie was astonishingly great that I felt this way. I was disappointed because I have never seen such an instant and passionate hatred online for a movie, and for no concrete reason that I can discern. ETERNALS is perhaps the best MCU film since Avengers: Endgame, and is the most ambitious superhero film I can think of in the past few years. Every minute looks gorgeous and is a visual feast. Director Chloé Zhao dares to go thematically where no Marvel movie has gone before. This is a brave and different big-budget tentpole movie that finally gives fans the deeper experience that many have been craving from the MCU, so it's only natural that critics are tearing this movie to shreds for being ""boring"" and ""dry"" while praising Dune in the same breath.Eternals is, admittedly, a lesser known Marvel comic that only hardcore fans are likely to know in detail.. However, the plot is simple: the Eternals are immortal beings that have been residing on Earth for centuries and have seen it through each stage of human development. Their goal is to rid the Earth of Deviants: monsters who ravage planets and the life that resides on them. The film transitions between present-day and important events during the Eternals' history on Earth to effectively tell their story. In the present day, the Eternals begin to realize that the Deviants are returning for unknown reasons and planning something terrible for humanity. However, some truths that the Eternals have taken for granted are not what they seem, and the truth may reveal a more complicated reality that will unearth some uncomfortable revelations.From the very start, the look and feel of ETERNALS is different from any other superhero movie, and that is almost entirely attributable to Chloé Zhao, who directs this big-budget Marvel blockbuster like an indie film. Most directors, when they are sucked into the MCU, are forced to water down their artistic tendencies and cater to the formula that Disney has established for their superhero movies. While Zhao still includes many of the trademarks Marvel fans are used to seeing, the general approach is different and more ambitious than the traditional origin story. ETERNALS is an epic of gargantuan proportions that has to not only develop each character at a personal level, but has to relay the story of how the universe was created and why life exists. Zhao does all of this with an auteur's creativity and expertise, and always manages to connect every aspect of the story to the deep human emotions ingrained in the plot material. Along with this, it examines some of the most existential and essential human issues one can explore -- it shares many themes with Zhao's previous films but on a bigger scale.Zhao also adds her visual flair to ETERNALS, making this far and away the most visually impressive MCU film yet, which is saying quite a lot when Shang-Chi, Thor: Ragnarok and many others exist. Sure, the movie doesn't have as vibrant a color palette as, say, Ragnarok does, but, similar to Nomadland, Zhao constantly has an eye for the natural light and the beautiful Earthy background, which, in this case, adds to the sentimentality the Eternals have for the planet they've called home for thousands of years. The wide shots in this movie are gorgeous and shot in a way that no other director could, and that alone makes this film stand out from other superhero films. Some have pointed out the shotty CGI in one or two scenes, however I did not notice these while viewing but only when people complained about them on the Internet. Almost every scene in this movie has impressive visual effects, so one or two scenes where the effects are noticeable failed to take me out of the narrative.The narrative is constantly engaging and emotional, and develops more layers as it progresses. A common complaint I have seen circling around film conversations is that all of the characters are dry and boring, and that the movie drags on because nothing is interesting. Not only do I disagree wholeheartedly with these thoughts, but I think these are some of the most complex, human and yet larger-than-life characters the MCU has introduced in a solo movie. Much of the details regarding each character's arcs are somewhat spoilers and were not revealed in any promotional material for the film, so I won't go into too much more specifics here, but the ethical dilemma that the Eternals have to face regarding the fate of humanity is one that even I was struggling to decide upon.Sure, I understand ETERNALS is not going to be for everyone, but there is something about the reaction of this movie that seems off-putting to me. Not often do I see a movie regarded by all as being a complete failure before many have even seen it, especially when said movie is a fantastic and well-made film that stands out from the pack. The acting here is all top-notch, with not one weak link throughout (Richard Madden as Ikaris was perhaps my favorite, although there are many great performances), and there was never one scene that struck me as even getting anywhere near the definition of the word ""bad."" While this does not make the movie good on its own, I find it odd how Marvel fans have been clamoring for both a movie that breaks from the formula and a movie that showcases diversity, and when one that covers both comes handed to them on a silver platter, it becomes ""the worst rated MCU movie ever made."" All I know is that ETERNALS deserves far more attention than critics seem to be saying, and I genuinely believe that in years to come people will begin looking back at the initial reception of this film as being erroneous and misguided. The ideas it has are far more interesting and contemplative than the reviews seem to be saying, and the clear amount of effort and passion put into every shot tell a story of success and creativity.A.",Eternals

There is no realism to the action. No stakes to the drama. It's cheap plastic entertainment. Thankfully, there were some human moments that shined through. Gemma Chan is lovely. The gay was fun. Sprite too. Richard Madden was a bit joyless. Angelina was stiff. (It would have been amazing if they cast an older actress as Thena - especially since she seemed to have alzheimers. Imagine Sharon Stone in the role - would have worked on many levels). Overall - this was too cumbersome and turgid a movie to have fun with.

There was definitely some parallels between some of the Eternals and more prominent DC characters, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment.

Unlike Dune, which is similar in length, this one feels 3 hours long. It is, in fact, about 1 hour too long. The storyline is interesting and some moral quandaries are posed, which heightens the viewing experience for some and may be beyond others. It just is not great as a Marvel movie, or as a movie.

The Eternals in that matter is the first one I found somewhat hard to predict.It is easily one of the hardest movies to direct, is up there with Watchmen or the dissapointing Dune.I dont get who the target audience here is. Young adults that grew with Marvel but are done with the childish plots?The most important part for me is that it opened the door for a Lovecraft adaptation with an outer god, the window was already open, but now is a wide door.

It was successfully done. I could not believe it was cohesive at all.Could it be done better? Maybe in an arthouse 5-10 hour movie. I am unaware if there is a precedent for a blockbuster of this size and relatively short runtime.The title of this review is meant to cause as much outrage as The Eternals. At the end of the day what I learnt is that we are irrelevant and small, minuscule filth in the universe, whatever good or bad you do while in here is all that matters, hating two people who kiss is what many focused on.

From The Massive Line Up Cast, Story & Character Building, Music, Jaw Dropping Epic Cinematography & Visuals, makes this an epic MCU comic book movie being brought to the screen. I was very excited to see The Eternals and one of my highly anticipating movies of 2021, and after coming out of it, made me love this movie EVEN MORE. Thena, Kingo, Gilgamesh, Phastos, Makkari And Sersi ARE BADASS STANDOUTS And the rest of the cast did a wonderful acting job, But all of them killed it and shout out to the hilarious Harish Patel. The Eternals Powers Looked CGI Golden AMAZING & Some POWERS that were definitely my favorites. Loved Their Ship too. The Epic Cinematography & Visuals were DAZZLING & INCREDIBLE ALL THE WAY THROUGH and The Beautiful shots were AMAZING and How Incredibly it needs to be experience in IMAX. The Action Scenes Were DOPE & Suprising And Some Of The Battles Were LEGENDARY. The Eternals Storyline & Plot Was Very INTRIGUING & Learning The Most Fascinating Thing About The Emergence and the way the story unfolds till the third act, WAS INSANE and making you definitely not look back. 2hrs was the Perfect length. HILARIOUS MCU Comedy. A Lot Of Suprising References To DC and I loved that Peter Pan & Wendy reference joke. Knowing Nothing Of The Eternals and going in blindly, the movie went back and forth and I loved the way they took time jumps to show how their history throughout 5000 years was hectic and rievting and the way they did it was pleasant and explained everything perfectly and to show how the MCU can tell such a new & intriguing backstory for all audiences going in & Made me want to read the Eternals comics as well. But also makes you grow attachment to The Eternals and love them as family and to me, that felt soo emotional and heartbreaking. The Deviants Were Brutal In Here & Looked CGI Beautiful. The Celestials looked Huge Than I Ever Imagined & Played A Huge Role In The Eternals Storyline, but hugely POWERFUL. The Movie alone delved A lot into Romance, Loss, Betrayal, the LGBTQ community, Happiness & Peace, Personal Character Situations, Tackling the beautiful themes of Humanity, that was touching & Embracing different Culture ex, The Bollywood scene that I adored, while also having to squeeze a little of the Marvel formula in here. Chloe Zhao's directing was soo visually spectacular and brought a different, yet comical stuffed film that went into whole different directions that question if you are watching a MCU Film or an UN MCU Film, despite her directing for Nomadland, this is one of her most beautiful un-mature 1st MCU Project to ever direct., but fingers cross if she wins Best Picture or An Oscar. Those TWO POST CREDITS WERE INSANE & Game Changers And Setting Up Two New Exciting Characters & Big Things For The MCU FUTURE Going FORWARD. Give Me A SEQUEL. Don't read those bad reviews or see that RT Score, Go see the movie and enjoy it for yourself.

By the 1970s Kirby wanted total control as writer, artist and editor for his newest ideas. Without oversight, Kirby weakness as a writer was his Achilles heel. His The Eternals, deriving ideas from Chariots of the Gods and 2001:A Space Odyssey, created a pantheon of Super-gods (Celestials) and the super-human Eternals and Deviants. The story didn't make much sense then, and it still doesn't even now.The film does little to sort out the nonsense.

See this film is totally different from the previous 25 films in the MCU. It's a shift towards something else, a different mythos. Chloe Zhao (if you have seen her earlier films) makes a certain kind of cinema. Seeing Eternals it feels she was given a good amount of creative control. The film might feel slow in the 1st half because of the immense world building it has to do with so many characters and myths involved. It still does it reasonably well. It's very unlike a traditional Marvel film with the cheek in tongue humor and a formulaic approach to film making which works incredibly well. The film has a lot to cover in 150 mins, and I felt it did cover everything to some extent but still left me wanting for more.The film has glorious visuals, it's just a feast for the eyes. The film takes you around the globe in different times, in different empires as it walks through the history of Eternals while. It's just cool to watch knowing what all the Eternals did from the start of mankind. Was pretty excited to see the GOT boys Richard and Kit, and they don't disappoint. It was eerie watching them say 'I love you Sersi""(Those who know, know). Angelina Jolie was breathtaking to watch, I simply couldn't take my eyes off her. Yet again Marvel Villain dissapoints me, as the Deviants don't have any character to them as they simply are like beasts. Post credit scenes are cool and give a great insight on the future. I'm psyched for the next chapter in the MCU gallore as they explore more amazing characters I grew up reading.

Their power sets are different and presented interestingly and beautifully.It has laughs, great surprises, twists and heart to go with the gigantic, crowded story it unpacks. There are some real-life questions that are brought to our attention - some people will like it, some not. I personally got zero problems with it, as a whole the movie is maybe one of the most matures in the MCU.At times it doesn't even feel like a ""next comicbook movie"", it's just a beautiful one, which will leave you hanging with some questions.Ramin Djawadi's score sounds amazing in all of the scenes, mixed with the fight, which are just epic and creative. I got no other words to express it.Easily this is one of the most important MCU movies for the future and you'll see why. I recommend that you do not be influenced by the rehearsals of people who purposefully hate the film, but look at the constructive things that are being written. It's not the best movie in the franchise, but it's a successfully taken risk, that will pay off in the years to come.My only minor problems are that some of the characters were built better than others, but also there are 10 new character that we see for first time. The other one is that the story jumps from one period to another one idea more than desired and I also understand, that the group is scattered around the world in the beginning of the movie. That doesn't change the fact that Eternals is a must for the big screen if you're a movie buff and a true Marvel fan.About the credit scenes...both are great, both will get you on the edge of your seat!",Eternals

That said, I don't understand the choices for music at the onset and the exit, at all. THAT said, the pay off in the last part of the film is huge. Any MCU person in it since 2008 has to see it because ""MCU"". I would suggest reading the comics first and becoming not only familiar with The Eternals but with the Titans (Thanos, etc.). Remember the dude in GotG Vol1 that is shown on a planet during The Collector's description of the Infinity Stoes? Yeah, that's important too so go read up on those!

It was not the best marvel movie ever, but it is most definitely not the worst or even close.Eternals adds a new layer to the already stacked MCU and I'm excited for what the future holds.

154,taranpannu01,Eternals (2021),9,7 November 2021,"In an age where superhero movies are churned out at an industrial level rate, it's a breath of fresh air when a movie within this genre turns up giving you something new to behold.Eternals follows a family of superheros sent to earth to protect humans from predators known as the Deviants. The film follows them first arriving on Earth, 7000 years ago and then in the modern day teaming up again to save the day once more.After winning an Academy Award for Directing Nomadland, Chloe Zhao is an inspired choice to direct this intimately beautiful story about a dysfunctional family that learns what it means to be human. After all, her indie darlings have all been focused on humanity and character driven pieces.Eternals is beautifully balanced by showcasing the relationship between these characters, whether it is the on and off century spanning relationship between Gemma Chan's lead, Sersi and her beloved Ikaris (Richard Madden). Or even the platonic love between the broken and suffering Thena (Angelina Jolie) and her hardy protector Gilgamesh (Don Lee).The film introduces ten new characters and somehow manages to equally display all their relationships and all their powers, giving them much more nuance and complex interactions then many Marvel solo outings that focus on singular characters.Zhao was also brought on board to visually give the Marvel universe a kick up the backside, we are all too accustomed to the green screen backgrounds Iron Man is flying on where you can clearly see the actors are interacting with nothing but a tennis ball. Eternals changes this, giving life to every scene as most was shot on beautiful locations, allowing the action and visual effects to be steeped in reality.The humour between characters feels effortless, with Kumail Nanjiani really providing the laughs and the action is incredibly exciting when it takes off with a special mention must be given to the visually stunning speedster Makkari (Lauren Ridlofff). I sorely recommend seeing this in IMAX, the visual effects and just the entire epic scope of this picture alone is something to behold. There are genuine jaw dropping scenes that are made for the biggest screen possible.The entire diverse ensemble do great work, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden prove solid leads with their complex relationship. Don Lee and Angelina Jolie are standouts, providing a warm and heartfelt storyline. Barry Keoghan, Brian Tyree Henry, Lia McHugh and Lauren Ridloff also make for great members of the ensemble, giving some of the most genuinely exciting action sequences as well as unexpectedly deep character interactions. Salma Hayek and Kit Harington make the most with their brief screen time. Die-hard superhero fans wil also want to stick around for the two credits scenes!This film will not be for everyone, it is patiently paced, allowing every character to have their moment, whilst dealing with incredibly mature themes on humanity that most superhero movies refuse to go. This is not your typical mindless action flick. Marvel and most likely Chloe Zhao have made the first indie feeling superhero movie that is a brilliant blend of incredibly jaw dropping spectacle and deep themes on love and what it means to truly be human.I hope this is a start for Marvel to take more risks and bring in more exciting filmmakers to create not just a superhero film but character driven pieces that really change the landscape of this oversaturated genre.",Eternals

160,mcummings-89092,Not a bad film just doesn't hit the MCU bar,7,8 November 2021,"Let me start by saying this is not a bad movie the problem is Marvel has set a very high bar and this doesn't quite clear it. Marvel have generally struck an excellent balance between action, adventure, comedy and excellent casting amd that balance is lacking in this movie.Now the film itself, there is a really lot to unpack and digest so chances are I don't cover everything but I do need to include spoilers to give a fair review. Firstly the movie is long and generally has less action than typical MCU films at least until the final third. In itself it's not really a problem, you are really getting the background to the eternals, why they are here and why they've never shown up in the MCU universe so far. The problem it has is that the characters are not always that interesting, some of them are actually dislikable (Druig Inparticular), others get limited screen time and bizarrely one character and his sidekick become slapstick comedy whilst the rest of the movie takes itself extremely seriously. You then have issues as the movie progresses that it kills off some of its more interesting characters and makes another a villian so by the end of the movie you are left with mostly supporting characters who are quite bland or you are not invested in due to limited screen time or that their characters are not very likeable.Now more into the characters, Gemma Chan is likeable and solid in her role but she lacks the charisma to carry a movie or be a lead - this is something Marvel has typically done very well in past so it stands out. Richard Madden is very good but the character arc is a disappointing bunt ultimately necessary one. Selma Hayek is never a lead but she does well in her limited screen time. Angelina jolie has lead films before but here is limited to a background character and not a particularly likeable one. The Indian character is completely out of place as a really powerful eternal that just becomes out of place (but welcome) comedic relief, yet he oddly disappears for the films final battle because he chooses not to participate. The other characters like the really smart gay character, the deaf speedster get very limited screen time so you don't care about them. The less said about Druig the better I cannot be the only one who was desperate for him to be killed off! Finally you have Kit Harrington again with very limited screen time and a washed up former boy band star appearing in a cameo - who thought that would be a good idea?Overall it's better than Black Widow/Hulk/Thor 2 and has a darker more drier feel to it (think Dr Strange) so it's worth a watch especially when it's clearly going to join other MCU teams (my money on Thor/Guardians/Dr Strange) but lowering expectations so you are not hugely disappointed.",Eternals

165,WLRSky,Different and Messy but Good,7,3 November 2021,"The movie opened today where I live, so I saw it!So this movie is the first MCU movie to go below 60% on RT.... so I was curious to see how it was / kinda expected it to be Mid.The movie does have some issues and boring parts and I can see why it got 56%. However I was fairly invested in the story and the movie overall left a good taste.+
The movie has Great Cast. Almost all the actors did a great job and characters were memorable. My favorites are Sersi, Ikaris, Thena, Kingo, Phastos and Makkari. It's not like every single one of them has an arc or anything ... but they all do leave some impression and are likable characters.I really liked this movie's aesthetics, from the Deviants to superpowers. The music was nice and there are some beautiful shots throughout the film.I really liked the lore with the Celestials. That part had some cool visuals!I also liked the philosophical questions the heroes face in the story. Even though I felt like it could've been handled a little bit better.-
The first half could be boring tho. In fact, I have a strong feeling that a Lot of people are gonna find this movie boring. There aren't THAT much action. And most of the action scenes are Fine.The first act in particular has some time-jumps and it can feel a little bit messy.Even though I initially gave it a 7, I do have a feeling that the movie is gonna age poorly upon Rewatch and Rethinking... Just like Black Widow.There are many scenes that are supposed to be emotional. And some moments in the final act are indeed emotional. However, in the first act of the movie there are moments where you are supposed to feel something but you just can't. There are not enough development done so you are not feeling the necessary emotions...The Deviants looked cool but that's it. Nothing special about them.+
Back to positives.... I really liked Makkari, the depiction of her speed power is, IMO, better than that of MCU quicksilver and dceu flash. I really hope we see her speed force more.Overall, the movie does kinda feel different from the other MCU movies. Some parts are messsy or boring, but great cast, visuals and lore made this movie overall good.7/10

The feature was anything but in my opinion. I was surprised in the best way. Introducing that many new characters at the same time in one movie is obviously a challenge, but I feel they managed to pull it off quite well.The film cast well known stars like Hayek and Jolie, but doesn't rely on them to carry the movie. It does however use flashbacks as an anchor and progression point to push the scenes forward, and at times add a twist or two. But it wouldn't be a Marvel film without some lightheartedness in it, using Kumail Nanjiani for some of the comic relief, which he naturally exhumes.The visuals are absolutely stunning, from the vast landscapes, space, the powers and monsters. The antagonist(s) were one of the vague areas the trailers did not want to advertise, to which I don't truly understand why, but letting that go and watching the movie has me wanting more.Two post credit scenes, both of which have a reveal, followed by a tease, because of course. They aren't bad, but the second shows less than I'd have liked. But that could just be me.The characters are full, they are fun, and they are unique in who they are in this Marvel universe.

And the complexity of life, whoever you are, the role we can choose or not to play... Yes, all these choices and opposite beliefs that make this world a big dramatic mess at times, but also a wonderful place that happens to generate the most magnificent things there is... And how deep, heartfelt connections are a decisive factor ; because love, in the end, is what matters and gives any life trajectory a more fulfilled feel... Even if this love takes you to your absolute demise, your existence will nonetheless have had a greater meaning and resonance with it...The movie tackles major philosophical themes ; and through the intimacy of its diverse characters, resonates on a higher plane... Each of The Eternals live a personal tragedy and have to face their doubts, dilemmas and demons, existential questions that go way further than anyone's perception... But as a connected family at its core, they also show the most admirable and moving aspects of what it means to be alive and aware of this incredible world around us...Probably the most gorgeous movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, virtuosically staged (congratulations to Chloe Zhao), every actor/actress fits his/her role perfectly, and they all deliver poignant performances. There are numerous deep emotional moments, in addition to all these striking epic sequences that obviously find their climax in the later parts of the movie (entwined with a heartbreaking dramaturgy that amplifies the emotional impact of it all). The score is a true gem and the entire production is a pure delight. Not a ""Space Opera"", but a ""Mythological Opera""...Definitely a Marvel movie that can't be compared to any other of the franchise...

It doesn't rush this (which is good) but after the initial action sequence it is a bit flat.There is humour, though it is fitful and feels a little forced at times. The actors are all good, but some of the dialogue feels a little stilted and the love affair between Richard Madden's Ikaris and Gemma Chan's Sersi lacks sparkle. Her scenes with Kit Harrington have much more chemistry.The film is beautifully shot.Set design and aesthetics were excellent, with a stunning set piece outside the Ishtar gate in Babylon. (Btw go see that if you are ever in Berlin .it's in the same museum as the Pergamon).The second half ramps the stakes up properly and has more action, drama and threat as well as a satisfying denouement .I went in half expecting a mess like a DC Justice League but this is a better movie than that.The main weakness of the film is that it inhabits the MCU. There are only a couple of references to Thanos and the snap but they beg more questions than they answer.Unsurprisingly there will be a sequel and I'd go see that too.Btw there are two end credit scenes . Both worth waiting for .Overall though itcs not bad. I'd give it a 7/10.",Eternals

I took a look through his posting history and uhh.. didn't like Shang Chi, didn't like Captain Marvel (on account of the actress being too leftist?), thought Iron Man 3 and Avengers Age of Ultron were the examples of movies ""back when Marvel was good"". Anyways, I thought this dude (user: sidfargas) is a good encapsulation of the type of person who thought this movie was garbage. Not that the movie is phenomenal, but the critique is overblown, often by those who prefer their movies and studios without an diversity or risk-taking.Anyways, onto the actual review. Couple of positives, couple of negatives. Overall a decent film. In the company of Phase 4 Marvel movies, I'd say this is behind Shang-Chi and ahead of Black Widow (though the gap between this and Shang-Chi is far greater than the gap between this and Black Widow).Lets start with the positives: Visual design is very good in this movie (great CG directing from the ILM team, props to them and Chloe Zhao for that aspect). Very attractive cast, good job guys. 3rd act conflict didn't feel trite like a typical formulaic Marvel CGI army fight, due largely to the nature of the conflict shifting and the movie evenly distributing CGI sequences throughout the duration of the movie. Felt similar to the resolution of WandaVision. Angelina Jolie is a top tier actress in here. Richard Madden plays a very interesting character, and the rest of the cast have solid chemistry. Also, fantastic plot devices (SPOILER AHEAD IN THESE PARENTHESIS, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE AND PLAN TO: There were like 2 major twists in the film, and I didn't see either of them coming. Good job on the story telling part of that, I was pleasantly surprised)Now the negatives: script writing felt a little strange. Some dialogue was really on the nose, motifs were repeated out loud rather than left for the audience to discover, comedic relief, while mostly very solid, was a little too constant. Pacing in the interpersonal relationships was rushed, largely in part to fitting 10+ new ""main"" characters into a 2.5 hr movie is no easy task. The stakes were large and the power scaling of the entire MCU is now very strange as a result.I think the sum of it is: Eternals was a very ambitious project in size and scale. Typically, Marvel is very good about exceeding apprehensive expectations to larger than life film-making and storytelling challenges (Guardians of the Galaxy, Civil War, Endgame, hell even the OG Iron Man), but this time, they really did bite off a bit more than they could chew. I think the dialogue was too weak and the interpersonal relationships to uncomfortably shallow for this to be marked as a narrative success by Marvel. In all, a decent watch, but with the talent invested in this movie, I hope to see major improvements in the next installments of whatever comes next for the Eternals.",Eternals

Or also how the Sprite dilemma of wanting to grow up and her existential crisis was handled so bannaly.And don't let me rant about all the foreshadowing and exposition that was so lame and predictable.

Being desperate to showcase all characters, the movie goes so far as to jump repeatedly back and forth on the timeline and across different places, while the audience barely understands their interactions, let alone be emotionally attached to them. With as many as 4 relationships that are, to say the least, mildly intimate going on within the 10 Eternals members and one of them being a love quad-triangle relationship, Chloe and Feige just couldn't find a way to show so much.The problem intensifies when approaching the 3rd act of the movie. The movie invested screentime talking about what the characters were doing after they split up, yet everything crumbles after eternals assemble. What are their personalities? What made them live the life they chose? And most importantly, what happened in their own private lives that shaped their decisions of whether or not to stand with the beings on planet Earth after they acknowledged the significance of their existence? What did they experience that re-shaped their views of their creators and enemies? Instead of diving deeper into a select handful of characters, movie chooses to instead go through all of them in a flashback-athon, and merely presents the fact that they simply made their decision as to take which side. How is the audience going to reciprocate their sentiment if we don't even know the rationale behind their actions?All of the characters have unique and interesting stories that are worth going in-depth, but the execution makes the Eternals family look as crippled and fragmented as the plot is shattered. The final product is a futile and incoherent attempt of a story crammed with information that is as forgettable as a blink in eternity, and even spectacular scenery couldn't save the movie from being a mess.",Eternals
183,luismcmlxii,When Marvel gets a good director good things happen.,10,4 November 2021,"I was sceptical about Eternals after being dissapointed by Black Widow and Shang-Chi, but how wrong I was.This movie is one of MCU's bests, beautiful cinematography, great acting and unexpected plot twists. Also some of the best CGI from any Marvel movie, the Celestials were just breathtaking and the sound design was absolutely astonishing, you should definitely watch this in theaters.Perhaps it feels a bit too long but it was necessary to tell the story of these god-like characters.",Eternals

When the bad reviews came, i did believe those as from trailers it was looking lackluster due to obvious reasons that it was new superhero team movie and we were not introduced with these characters before.But with such bad / average reviews, i went to watch with low expectations, but it turned out a very good and entertaining movie.The Cast is amazing, direction is very good, action is perfect, visuals, cinematography is stunning and beautiful.Just villian is not that good though there are pretty much good action sequences with deviants.The color tone is the USP of the movie, which is very different from any other Marvel movie.Overall i really enjoyed it watching it in IMAX and would recommend everyone to give it a try.",Eternals
185,iamshawnieb,It fits right into the MCU,8,8 November 2021,"The main ""issue"" people seem to have with this film has very little to do with what's on screen and very much what is behind the scenes. I won't even be touching on those because there was nothing in it that felt out of place or made the movie not work.What does work is the visuals and the aesthetic. This does not look like a typical Marvel movie and that's all for the better. The fans have been saying that the stand alone films were becoming the same and too formulaic, so here we go. As far as structure goes it does not fit the same 3 act structure that many others follow. The character development is significantly more developed than many other films with far less characters.Overall, it works. There are some nitpicking things like comedic timing not as flush as some other films. And run time but Marvel doesn't treat it's fans like idiots. Sure they could cut the runtime by 10 minutes but none of the ""extra "" stuff felt boring or shoehorned in. And cutting for the sake of cutting isn't necessary this far into the MCU.So, the movie is good. Well shot. Well written. And the story and characters never felt out of place in the current universe. I can see these characters doing a lot more in upcoming projects. And exploring more of them and the possibilities of their powers sounds very good to me.",Eternals

Just make someone fight for something. Really, it is boring and left me so oblivious, that I will not even ponder if the blockbusters degenerated into this sterile hodge-podge because that was what the average audience wanted, or the customer taste was over time ""cultivated"" to be satisfied with this ""a bit of fight a bit of love"" template non-sense. Even the 1990s catastrophic epics look like a ""high art"" compared to this ""fast film"" hamburgeriade.Idiotic costumes and kitschy designs - even for a comic adaptation. Some fighting with absurd weapons and abilities that in its entirety would be too much even for a parody. Concocted storyline. Horribly painful replicas, debilitating dialogues, whimsical motivation. Are the studio managers so stupid or so anxious in relying on the elementary-school few-word sentences that actually just comment on what is happening on the screen?

I'm excited for what's next (again),8,6 November 2021,After the news building up to this film I was apprehensive to see whether the criticisms I was hearing were true and I am pleased to say I enjoyed the film more than I was expecting. This is a great MCU film.It was always going to be hard to introduce 10 new characters and give them all sufficient time to develop but I think the film managed it well enough with many of the key players in the story being given good development and I cared for many of the team by the end. My rating is as high as it is because I think Chloe Zhao does a great job at piecing the overflowing epic story together in a neat easy to follow (after the first 15 minutes) way which managed to surprise me in good ways as the story progressed.This is one of the most epic yet personal marvel stories out there with action scenes shot perfectly while also giving each character (except a couple) conflict and emotional drive.Please stay for the 2 end credit scenes which tease ever so slightly some future projects which I cannot wait to see.I will happily watch this movie again and I'm pleased to see representation of all types included in a film without it being made a thing.

199,reprisecompilation,Finally a good Marvel movie - with a different approach,10,10 November 2021,"The Eternals is a good adventure movie with a different pacing, style and cinematography.Interestingly, it does have way more gravity than previous dozen ones and a more interesting storyline that works with some pre-knowledge of legends.Luckily, it is only sometimes cringeworthy and other than the first few minutes and some unnecessary jokes it is an enjoyable cinematic experience. Well, dialogues don't live up to the movie for sure, on the other hand, the whole concept (and the undeniable borrowing from the DC Universe) works just as the actors.Even Angeline Jolie turned to be a good choice and Salma Hayek luckily wasn't too much. True, the lesser known actors are carrying the show instead of the leads but that's totally ok and enjoyable.The Eternals has 4 major parts and the pacing makes the long running time easy to watch.It is definitely not the common ""Marvel movie"" - that formula was exhausted long ago. If one pays attention everything makes sense - sometimes good to think of a story and put the puzzle together; being said it's not a mindless action orgy, although the action segments are well crafted.The soundtrack is a good addition, not taking the attention away from what is important.If not a few scenes, this could have been a great standalone sci-fi/fantasy/tale, too.Have an open-mind and just enjoy something new, fresh and good.",Eternals

I also have to emphasize the connection to the general history the story depicts which is just so interesting to see. I literally only have good things to say so i might be biased but this in my opinion is so worth it folks and i genuinely enjoyed it from the first minute to the end.

Canonically, Sersi (Gemma Chan's character) has the on/off relationship with Makkari, not Ikaris. Ikaris is played by a white male in the movie. In the movie, Makkari is now a black woman with a hearing disability. In summary, Chloe Zhao literally rewrote canon so she could watch her white male and asian woman sex scene fantasies come true.The Latino leader was always hinted as being very close with the Asian character, and Zhou could have easily put in whatever romantic stuff she wanted there, but instead, both were killed off fairly early instead. Literally sounds like to me that Zhou had a diverse cast put so she can scream about how progressive she is, and then immediately has them killed off or emasculated so she can dominate the movie with her white male/asian female sex scene. Chloe Zang went out of her way to change the comics to push her white male fantasies. Diversity just for the sake of diversity. Typical Hollywood.",Eternals

The film would fall back into marval clichés after some original and incredible scenes, seemingly being moderated by Disney corporate commitiees.The ending is a perfect example of cookie cutter Disney and really highlighted how even the most original and ambitious Disney project likes to play things safe.

the tragedys hit me hard.The effects ...i mean wow ...best movie effects ive seen to this day piriod.The acting is great angelina julie is giving here 200%.And to my surprise kingo (playd by Kumail nanijani) is one of my favorit new superheroes and cracked me up every time he was on screenthe judge celestial is acting just like the judge celestial in the comics and with a great prespective great cgi and great voice work he does look very manacing also like a celestial should.I could talk on the good stuff for houres but the movie does have flawsso what was the downside of this ?Well,
1. For me biggest is they intreduce a LOT of new things to the marvel universe.I mean... i dont think they follow the main avengers or relating to the avengers at all in this movie its all completely new stuff
also when u have a world with 5 or 8 even superheroes its great they are important
but once u add to this world
eternals / celestials / divients / avengers / superman ?! I mean wtfb/ maybe in the future xmen
its a bit too much...
too much storylines to follow that dont combine so much with one another.Also i dont understand in loki tv show there is a new villan in the end of it
in wondavision she becomes sort of different in the end.In here you got all the thing with the celestials
i mean...we didnt even got to spiderman and already we have so much new villans and storys
i really hope doctor strange wil fix it in 1 year.Another issue i had with this movie is
yes...where where the celstials when thenos wiped half the world.(if they intreduce superman even as a side joke here...then you could ask where was superman also....it never ends)
but ok they address it in this movie a lot of times.But
Where was the avengers when the s$&@t in this movie went down ?Its like they dont want to see each other or something ..in general i really really liked this movie
it has its flaws some bigger once some dont make sense
but literelt every movie has flaws even 10/10 ones.I loved it a lot and do think it deserve to be watched in cinemas.Im not going to remember it in 1month

I feel like the end would have had catastrophic consequences, but everyone is walking around normally like nothing at all happened. Unless it somehow ties into Spider-Man: No Way Home at that same moment (but I don't think it can , given what we see on the news at the end), it just doesn't make sense.I did like that each member of the team offered something different. I could say more, but I feel like the more I think about it and come up with more confused questions, the less I would rate this movie. I will just leave it at that. It just doesn't REALLY fit, and I hope Eternals 2 will at least show how they fit into the Marvel universe.Good god, please do not start adding sex scenes to Marvel movies. It adds absolutely nothing and, honestly, left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the movie. Are people so dense that they cannot stop thinking about sex for one moment in every aspect of their life that they just need it be absolutely everywhere? I am not that person.

218,djmomo17,"""Eternals"" is both loads of fun and almost definitely the most ""mature"" Marvel film to date.",9,7 November 2021,"When the Eternals were announced as being featured in a future Marvel films, I was pretty unimpressed. Having read the original series, I didn't see how the concept could possibly fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And with a the film being directed by Chloe Zhao, known only for the indie film ""Nomadland"" (which was not my cup of tea), I was less enthused. However, after seeing the film I was very pleasantly surprised.Eternals is a COSMIC Marvel film. In its premise, famous characters from mythology (Gilgamesh, Athena, Mercury, Icarus, Hephaestos, etc.) are revealed to have actually been a team of superbeings sent to Earth by ""space gods"" to help the development of mankind (kind of an ""Avengers"" of the Ancient World). The movie takes place in the present, but flashbacks document episodes from over the last 7000 years of human history. This gives the film the opportunity to take the audience to many different time periods and to many different regions of the Earth. It's a feast for the world history buff, that's for sure.As the film proceeds, these ageless ""Eternals"" start learning about their true mission on Earth, and have to make decisions which might affect not only Earth, but the future of many planets in the galaxy. Although this is a Marvel ""superhero"" film, it actually comes across more as a thoughtful science fiction epic. The Eternals are not humans who wear power suits or who have been given super-powers through artificial means, but are actually alien beings who have made Earth their home for thousands of years. In fact, these superbeings have lived on Earth long enough that they have taken on the emotional characteristics of humans. Now they must rise to defend their adopted home against their own godlike masters from outer space. In a bold move for a Disney product, this film presents some complex moral choices (at least on par with ""Captain America: Civil War""), and even at the end of the film there is an earned sense of consequence.Aside from the massive mythology that this film has to present, it also has 10 main characters to establish, each with their own personalities, powers and back history. In an amazing feat of pacing, the film manages to do just that, giving each character a meaningful introduction and arc.As usual for an MCU film, there are lots of visual-effects supporting battlescenes, but there also many scenes simply featuring the natural beauty of its locations as well as many scenes highlighting the diversity of global culture.In the end, ""Eternals"" is both loads of fun and almost definitely the most ""mature"" Marvel film to date. The Marvel Cinematic Universe seems to be following the pattern the comics did in the 1970s by introducing more varied concepts incorporating elements of sf, horror and ""art-house"" than just super-strong capes. It's a very welcome move.",Eternals

220,hawkinsuhc,I love having a COMPLETE understanding..,8,5 November 2021,"I know this movie got a lot of bad reviews but I actually enjoyed it. All too often, with lengthy films, you end up asking why or what or when or how. Everything was answered in this movie. I think the critics were looking for the typical Avengers movie what action about 10 minutes after it starts and just not ending. This movie took the time to explain the Eternals origin and why whoever did what they did. I was kind of sad about one character dying. I'm hoping since they were created, and had the ability to be created again and again, that he will come back with a fresh new memory. With all that being said, I loved the movie. I can't wait for the sequel because I think all the action that many are looking for will be in that one.",Eternals

You get the odd bit of beautiful cinematography yet some shots even in the same scene are shot in imax where others aren't and it can be incredibly jarring. The acting is hit and miss but mostly miss, Angelina Jolie should have remained retired.Save your money and wait till it's released to stream.",Eternals

Some nicely different powers from the Eternals, exept Ikarus. Laser eyes, really? How original. LOL.Acting wise, marvel managed it again to get accomplished actors playing like being absent. Richard Madden stood out, best performance, most others were just bland. Compere Selma Hayek with ""Killer's bodyguard"" in terms of not the characters but expression, intensity, etc.Overall, much better than black widow, but below Shang Li. Too many characters that leaves you indifferent. One can, but not must see movie. I recommend home cinema with a couple of cocktails or beers ;-)",Eternals
226,mawallin,Just way too long!,6,3 November 2021,As expected it's visually spectacular with great CGI and photography. Acting is mostly good and the story is actually not so bad but this should never have been a 2.35 hour movie. I don't mind a slow paced movie that builds up towards the end but so many scenes are there seemimgly without a purpose or could at least have been cut in half. Too bad because this could have been a pretty good movie if the story had been told differently and in a more suspensfull manor.,Eternals
227,jaidanh,Eternals could be less complicated if it wasn't part of Marvel,6,5 November 2021,"I can understand why critics are treating Eternals a bit too harshly. Eternals is very different from all the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, at the same time, it attempts to maintain the basic structure of its other recent films. The critics expected to see a basic Marvel movie, but they did not meet their full expectations. That makes Eternals difficult to please most Marvel fans. However, I can praise the film for a couple of things. The acting is good and I'm proud of Marvel for having diversity in its cast. The film score is gorgeous and doesn't sound like any other Marvel scores. The cinematography is excellent in many shots; however, a few shots in the movie involved using a green screen, and the cinematography didn't blend well with it. Another problem with the film is that most of the characterization is weak. Kit Harington's character is the most pointless of all characters in the film as he only appears for a few minutes at the beginning of the film and isn't seen again until the end. The post-credits scene showcases some information about his character that will be explored at some point in the MCU, but it felt like something that could've been saved for another movie. Despite being the biggest celebrity in the film, Angelina Jolie also didn't get enough screen time or character development. The screenplay is probably the most flawed screenplay of all MCU movies. It has too much exposition; the characters explain too much information instead of letting the movie show. I get that the film needed some explanations since many people are unfamiliar with the Eternals, but it could've been executed much better. There's also a lot of flashbacks in the film, most parts of which serve as filler. While it does help us learn more about the characters, there were still some bits that could've been cut. In fact, most of this film seems like it tried to cram so much about the Eternals into one movie instead of giving it all to us by dividing it into thirds like most Marvel trilogies. If that doesn't make sense to you, imagine for a minute that Marvel never existed, but suddenly a movie called Avengers: Infinity War comes out. That's exactly what Eternals feels like. I know Tony Stark once said, ""Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk,"" but that does not apply to the process of creating a movie franchise. With that said, Eternals is going to be challenging to build a trilogy upon. The end of this film does tease a sequel, but I can picture this planned series going down the path of the Divergent films. In other words, I find it hard to imagine the sequel(s) maintaining its audience. I would like to see the Eternals as a team appear in future Marvel movies, but if we're giving them their own movies, they'll have to take a different direction to stay consistent.",Eternals

239,jeremyfrydman,Good Elements... But Lackluster,5,3 November 2021,"It's far better than I thought it would be, to call this worse than Ant-Man and The Wasp is braindead.The CGI is great, some performances are really good (not you Selma Hayek), the story had a few clever elements, the representation is great, deserved and needed, I think the costumes look great and Zhao did a good job directing.Bryan Tyree Henry was the best part of the movie, his character was dope and I wish they did more with him and that he had more screen time.Richard Madden (aka worse but sexy Homelander) and Gemma Chan were the standouts here, each elevating their material even when it becomes ridiculous and crazy.Ok the downside is that this movie really has no idea what it wants to be. It's tone completely changes constantly, some characters just turn evil and then good again, oh and some literally just leave lol.It wants to have the grandeur of a world ending threat that's so unbelievably impossible for the characters to solve that they're forced in their third act to come up with this ridiculously easy and stupid plan that is right out of a Power Rangers movie.The villains are boring, forgettable and underdeveloped, plus the CGI for the lead deviant is horrendous. The worst part about this is that the movie knows how bad the villain is because then, you know, the main cast of characters basically become the villains themselves.Some performances are pretty dry, especially from Salma Hayek who looks so miserable to be there, it really sucks. Angelina Jolie's character is cool but her performance kinda lacks, she's a completely forgettable character that does and achieves very little.Kumil Nanjiani's character also just leaves and does nothing in the third act and then gets credit.One characters name is literally Sprite lmao, like the soft drink.The pacing is kinda all over the place, the movie is pretty boring, which is weird for a Chloe Zhao film, since Nomadland flows so beautifully.Look, it was better than I thought it would be, it has nice moments but overall it's kind of a giant mess.Chloe Zhao did the best she could but yeah it was like ""eh"", it's no 'The Suicide Squad' 😎Oh and also they reference DC characters in the movie???

Feels too fantasy for me instead of action. Don't like the direction of cgi monster fighting, it's like fighting the boring ultron. Trying to unite all to fight an external alien. No depth. Yuck. I actually hated the monster part in Shang chi too. Wenwu's multi layered character made me a fan. Disney is really good at turning fun into a boring unmemorable overused lazy pile of dirt made with gold. High budget, same stale cake. The movie is ok, just too many characters, and none of them shine, except Ikaris (evil superman vibe). I like the gay couple. I just don't like the story telling. When i want to watch a disney cartoon fairy tale, I'd watch one. But when I watch an superhero film, I want to watch a superhero film, not a disney hero for kids film. Going to watch dr.

245,jackbryant-00743,Do Not Listen to the Critic Reviews. Have an opinion by yourself,10,5 November 2021,"EXTREME EXTREME EXTREME SPOILERSI loved the Film so much. The Acting from all of the cast is amazing. The cinematography and directing was fenomenal.Sersi, Druig, Makkari, Phastos, Thena, Gilgamesh, Dane Whitman, Kingo & Karun are stand out characters for me and I loved every moment with them in it. Sprite was a good character too but some of her actions made me not like her as much. I was so annoyed with Ikaris but for good reason, We were meant to. It is what the Director wanted. Salma Hayek's Ajak was killed off pretty quickly but was shown in several flashbacks which I liked. One death I was really upset with was Gilgamesh although I understand why this choice was made. One character who I think could have a bit more screentime was Bill Skarsgård's Kro, Kro was on screen a lot but not with Skarsgård's voice.One thing that is extremely sad is seeing this movie getting nuked with bad reviews because it features a Gay Couple, Several Characters of Ethnic Minority and a Deaf Actress. The Cast aren't just diverse for the sake of being diverse, They all act brilliantly and hope to see some of them again in the future.The film ends on a cliffhanger with Arishem stealing Sersi, Phastos and Kingo from earth.The two end credits are both very important for the future of the MCU. One of them shows Harry Styles as Eros/Star Fox/Thanos' Brother meeting the remaining Eternals who left earth (Thena, Druig and Makkari) And the other shows Dane Whitman opening a box with a sword in which obviously hints towards him becoming Black Knight, A voice can be heard off screen in this scene and it is Mahershala Ali as Blade.Overall I was extremely happy when leaving the cinema because this was a different kind of MCU, And definitely a good kind of different. I highly recommend watching this movie. BUT REMEMBER This is only my opinion of the movie, Make sure to watch it yourself and have your own opinions on it.",Eternals
246,danieljackthomas,I wanted to like it more than I did,7,6 November 2021,"I really wanted to like this film, and whilst I did think it was ""good"" (or ""okay""), it should have been ""great"". For a start, the film felt way too long, some parts dragged and there was just so much going on. It felt non-stop yet still managed to feel slow in parts. There were also so many plots constantly evolving that it made it difficult to fully appreciate any one given moment.The first half of the film was definitely more enjoyable for me than the latter half, though I do massively respect that they have at least tried to do something different here and not follow the MCU formula that so many follow.Pros:
The Cast were awesome and all round i'd say the acting was pretty good.Plenty of likeable characters.Fight scenes were enjoyable.Some beautiful shots throughout.Cons:
No real solid villain.Pacing was up & down and tbh... kinda off.Kind of killed off some of the more likeable characters? Felt like they shot themselves in the foot a bit for future installments.Kit harringtons character, whilst completely fine, kind of just felt shoehorned in.Wasted some of the ""bigger"" actors in my opinion.",Eternals

248,michaelely-01627,"Not the worst, not the best.",6,7 November 2021,"This film makes me appreciate Endgame a bit more. Endgame showed audiences that a bunch of heroes could share the screen as long as we cared about them and they had their own point and purpose. Eternals attempts to do the same, but in it's 2 and a half hour runtime they don't manage to give their heroes enough character development, beyond the droning exposition, to equal The Avengers. The end result is a cinematic version of the old saying, ""too many cooks in the kitchen"". The plot and pacing are quite convoluted at times, and I, as well as many other MCU fans are growing wise and weary of these ""Everything is at stake, and yet nothing is really at stake"" plot lines. The acting and direction were great. Cinematography was great. But we've seen these action sequences done a lot better. We've seen these villains better done in the Hellboy franchise. The music of this film was not iconic. In the end, I was bored. My butt was sore from all that sitting, and I left the theater not really caring about what I had just watched. Most marvel films see me out of the cinema with a smile on my face, eagerly discussing what I just witnessed. Not this time, sadly.",Eternals
249,superiorhart,It isn't the best but it definitely isn't the worst,7,4 November 2021,"I understand most of the negative complaints about the movie but it was also refreshing to see a movie like this.First of all, the movie was absolutely beautiful. The music is also really great.I love the characters. They all have their own thing and have their own personality. Makkari is definitely my favourite. I am sad what they did with 2 of the characters. I understand it was for the plot but it's just a shame. But maybe that they can change that in the next movie considering what we found out about them.Kit Harrington was a bit wasted in this film but we all know that he'll get a bigger role in another movie so I'll let that one pass.The villian also could've been better. They didn't feel like a threat and it was quickly over with them. With the other villian (if you can call them that, I'm not sure) it didn't feel like a threat until the last scene. I'm also conflicted if I like it what they did with a character to help the villian.The plot itself was alright. They had to explain a lot but sometimes they gave too much information at once which made it confusing and a bit boring. But the overall plot was just fine and just like every other MCU movie.First post credit scene was good. I'm curious what they'll do with that. I did laugh when the characther appeared because I'm just not sure about the actor. The second one was disappointing. We all knew that it was going to happen but it's still nothing. They also stopped at the most interesting moment.Overall, the movie has indeed it's downsides but it also has it's good moments. I'll definitely rewatch it the second it's released on Disney+. Just watch it and decide for yourself if this is a movie you'll like or not. In the end it's still a MCU movie and really not that bad as some people make it out to be. I enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to see more of the Eternals.",Eternals

I guess that's my fault, i got sucked into the promotional material and now my disappointment is even greater.Let me preface this by saying that Eternals is by no means a BAD film. It's pretty solidly okay. It has some really weird decisions (using American Sign Language in 5000 BCE, for example), but is still worlds better than T:DW or AM&TWEternals would have clearly been better suited for a long-form medium like a tv series; much is skipped to streamline the story to a lofty near-three hours. Inconsequential details such as the name of the main antagonist deviant are omitted in favor of the MCU's first sex scene-one that is wholly unneeded to frame the depth of the relationship between the characters involved. Overall, some strange liberties are taken and whether or not you like them remains to be seen.",Eternals
251,MoviePeek,Not perfect but there's a lot to love,7,9 November 2021,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a triumph, whether the superhero action blockbusters are to your taste or not, their creations have shaped the cinematic landscape for over a decade and continues to leave fans more eager for expansion than ever. Eternals is the latest entry in Marvel's phase four rollout and the 26th film in the franchise overall, that's not even including the juggernaut's expansion into television.Marvel is obviously popular, but not beyond criticism, and has often been accused (among other things) of being too conservative, and recycling their formula, creating safe and soulless films.Eternals tries something a little different, an epic superhero saga spanning thousands of years, featuring a cast of superpowered ancient beings that are about as relatable as Howard the Duck. It's also one of the longest movies in the franchise to date, stretching over two and a half hours, and featuring ten never before seen characters, which all must be developed and fully fleshed out. At the time of writing this review, the film has garnered mixed reviews, and it's clear that the film isn't for everyone. However, I was pleasantly surprised by Eternals, and despite some legitimate problems spattered throughout its considerable run time, the more time passes the more respect I have for the film and the bold and often brilliant choices it makes.Despite the high concept nature of the film, the plot itself is fairly straightforward. The Eternals have been sent to earth and are instructed to only interfere unless Deviants are involved. The Deviants in question are hulking grey wibbly-wobbly aliens that cause carnage and generally wreak havoc. After thousands of years of fighting these nasty boys, their task is seemingly complete, and the team goes their separate ways. However, flash forward to the present day and the unexpected and unexplained re-emergence of The Deviants causes the team to reform and uncover a mystery bigger than any of them could have ever imagined.Despite the large cast of characters, it's clear that Sersi, played by Gemma Chang is the protagonist of the story. She's the character with the most screen-time and is given the most to do. She has the power of matter transmutation and can turn something into something else. I was surprised by the application of her gift, and it presents some genuinely great moments and proved to be far more useful in a combat situation than I expected. In a world of smashy-crashy-punchy people, these are the kind of weird abilities more characters need. The film largely succeeds in balancing screen-time between the rest of The Eternals, with everyone getting something to do, and motivations that make sense. The first Avengers movie notoriously gave Hawkeye the short end of the straw, rest assured that this does not happen in Eternals.My favourite characters outside of Sersi, were Kingo, Druig, and Gilgamesh. Kingo provides plenty of laughs throughout the film and out of all the Eternals had the strongest connection to the people of Earth. Druig proved to be one of the more emotionally complex characters that I thought initially I would hate, but his motivations were ultimately relatable, and I found myself siding with him above all others. Finally, Gilgamesh used his limited screen-time to leave a big impression, adding laughs and heart to an otherwise epic film.Marvel's track record with villains is very hit and miss, Eternal's baddies The Deviants, are given some complexity and motivation, but ultimately it amounts to very little. This is my biggest gripe with the film, and I found them to be very underwhelming. First of all, I don't really care for the design of these space monsters, they don't look fun they look boring, and not for a moment did I believe they could actually exist. Where Thanos or the Skulls look like they could exist in the real world these grey blobs simply could not. Their leader or head honcho is a Deviant named Kro, and he is potentially the ugliest alien in recent memory. The film attempts to make him more than a hulking monster but come the finale it doesn't come together in a satisfying way, and he ends up being very forgettable.To be honest, The Deviants are my only real big criticism, and I found that the majority of the film worked for me. This truly is one of the most epic films Marvel has produced to date and I liked that about it. It was bold and beautiful. Sure, there are expositions dumps here and there and I really hope we don't start every film with a scrolling wall of text from here on in. There's a lot of mythology to unpack here, we are after all talking about the start of the Marvel Universe here.Directed by Chloe Zhao, she brings a different feel to Eternals from other entries in the franchise, with epic sweeping visas and a more serious tone. That doesn't mean it's for everyone, and mainstream audiences may reject its sense of grandeur and sci-fi craziness. For me at least Eternals was a pleasant surprise, and going in I tempered my expectations given the mixed reviews, but ultimately enjoyed the experience for the most part. Eternals succeeds mostly in exploring a new corner of the marvel universe, providing an epic tale that is truly unlike anything the franchise has done before. Featuring many complex and enjoyable characters, the film however fails to reach the peak of the genre due to its weak and muddled villains.",Eternals
252,robert-b-norby,"Important film for the MCU, but unfortunately quite boring",6,7 November 2021,"I am quite the MCU fan, but never read any source material. So I judge this film accordingly.What we learn in this movie is clearly going to be important for the path forward within the MCU, so it needs to be watched. But watching it was a bit of a chore.The movie spends a looong time giving us the backstory to the Eternals role as they were placed on Earth 7000 years ago. A LOT. We're talking 45 minutes of flashback from thousands of years ago.But unfortunately, instead of coloring the characters, making them relatable, giving them personal goals and challenges and making us care whether or not they can overcome them, its all just visually stimulating history-channel material. When you don't feel for the characters, so much falls flat and becomes dialogue that simply becomes informative, and not compelling.The actions scenes are fun, and very well made. Several quite spectacular scenes occasionally redeems the watchability. But they are so far apart that it doesnt even come close to making me want to watch this again. And that becomes the case when the actions scenes are the only part worth re-watching, which itself is a bit sad.The movie kinda does the dual bad-guy thing, with one bad guy getting a very solid build up, and the other sort of on the sideline until the end. The actual interesting bad guy story arc (with a build up) is very abruptly finished off, while the other takes over. Im sorry, but this is just so unsatisfying, and I dont understand what the writers were thinking about here.I really wanted this movie to be great. Its story, as said, is something you need to know if you want to stay up to speed with the MCU, but with so much plain information-talking, backstory that feels mandatory to watch but does nothing for the build-up, and cool action scenes miles apart, I think this could become the first of all MCU movies that I will only watch once. It's not the worst of the lot (*cough* Iron Man 2), but it would still be the most painful to rewatch.I don't want to rate this out of frustration, so I give it a 6. A 6,5 perhaps, but that's not an option IMDB gives us.All in all, this movie is like a story told where the storyteller needs to explain a bunch of terms and backstory before he can actually tell it, and then failing to make all the pre-explanations feel worth the time it took to listen. But as said, all that information will surely be useful later; it just didnt do much to make this particular story very interesting.",Eternals

So please do not skip on this flick because of that.What we get is a visually stunning movie with great locations and amazing CGI (like most of the Marvel films). The actors all have proven themselves in various other projects but the dialogue could have been better sometimes. The actors are limited by the writing and it shows.I didn't find it confusing, it's all explained nicely but you have to connect the dots yourself. Personally I prefer this over being treated like a toddler. Yes you have to process a lot sometimes in a long movie but it's better than half a movie and a two year wait. I actually want to watch it again because of this.What really got me excited was the original plot, it's not all black or white. The ""good"" guys have a dark side and the ""bad"" guys have a motivation you can understand.This is still a popcorn movie but maybe one of the most grown up Marvel movies this far. We still get the usual humor and action but this is an origin movie that introduces us to the new group in our beloved universe, so don't expect an epic ending but a quality set up for the next phase.",Eternals

I hope to see more representation in the MCU going forward.However, this film is a snoozefest. It is so dull and dour you would have thought it was a Zack Snyder film. The Eternals spend the film standing in fields looking dramatic, sitting at tables and spouting exposition and weak attempts at deep themes. Then some cgi fighting happens and its back to dullness.This film is nearly 3 hours long and, trust me, you'll feel every second of it. I honestly prefer Thor: the Dark World and Black Widow to this.",Eternals

It wasn't the best film I've seen, but I have a lot of respect for the effort to make this.Eternals has the humor, top-notch special effects, and references that make it an MCU movie.The notes that worked in this film are the humor, VFX, stunning visuals, and fight scenes. The notes I think need improvement are the character development, the runtime, and understanding of character motivations.",Eternals
260,vibhus-17780,Decent,7,5 November 2021,"A bit Vague movie , but that doesn't means it's bad one . This movie is bit different from usual Marvel movies as expected . Story was good and clear , Storytelling was also good but they failed in clear characterisation for the characters . Main reason for unclear characterisation may be the number of characters , there are 10 Eternals in the movie , so there may be lack of time for the character establishment . Sometimes I felt , flash back scenes were affecting the flow of movie , but they were important for explaining the origin of Eternals . This time Marvel humor bit failed in some places . Movie also had some plotholes . Marvel is famous for surprising elements , this movie didn't had that as expected . Cast done their job well . Asusual visuals were stunning and Marvelous , cinematography and Vfx were topnotch . Music was good . We should really appreciate the Marvel for LGBTQ ( Gay ) reference in the movie . I really liked the making style of Chloe Zhao . Overall a decent Marvel film to watch . Eventhough movie has some flaws , according to my opinion it's worthy one to watch it on Big screen .",Eternals
261,kristianlepka,"Don't let the bad reviews fool you, this is a great film!",8,6 November 2021,"Going into this I tried to keep my expectations to a bare minimum, though the bad reviews I kept seeing didn't help. I knew nothing of the characters, the plot, anything. Basically the only thing I knew I got from the trailer.This isn't your typical marvel flick with mostly light hearted tones and the more serious stuff glanced over, this is a mostly serious film in my eyes, and I love it. Yes, you still get the jokes but it leans into the darker tones way more than you'd expect. We got a hint of this in Infinity War too, but here it is way better.Now let's address some typical points in the bad press this has gotten. One of those is that there's bad CGI, which like, did we watch the same film? Did I notice it? Of course, there's aliens made of purple string, how could I not. But it wasn't distracting nor immersion breaking in any way. The film also didn't fall into the typical trope of large CGI marvel fight ending. Was there a fight? Yes. But it wasn't the ""let's fight thousands of faceless monsters"" type of fight. It was a personal struggle between characters you got to know through the film, and got me several times emotional.Overall, I'd say give this film a go (as if you weren't to already). Just please, don't trust the bad reviews.",Eternals

After the last Avengers movie, I noticed the interest for the MCU had noticeably declined. Don't put down a movie just because it's the cool thing to do. Externals isn't the best but it's a fantastic movie. It came with the typical Marvel cheesy humor that's in every movie/show so everyone saying the dialogue is bad, every MCU is cheesy af.

The joke, the character build-ups, actions, even the transition was very rough. Chloe no doubt is great making Oscar worthy dramas but she is not the right person to direct even to make the script this adaption.There's not enough apparent experience between characters to make an exploration of these ""eternals"" complicated feelings possible, making it's dis appealingSomewhere directors of Thor trilogy is breathing a sigh of relief; he's no longer responsible for the worst Marvel film.Lastly please don't use any outside MCU's references. It's just not the right place.",Eternals
267,goshamorrell,In the beginning...........,10,5 November 2021,"In the beginning... Eternals is Marvel's biggest swing in years. Marvel's New Superhero Saga Is Visually Splendid But Lacks Standard Values and Pacing. Certainly, The Weakest Marvel Film Recently. Eternals, a part of Marvel's phase four, is a complete new chapter in MCEU's book. Although the film has references given about running in the same time as other Marvel flicks such as 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame', it has eternal backdrop right from 5000 BC. I wonder, if they were really here when Thanos caused mass destruction, why the hell they didn't show up? Oops, Let me go soft from here. Eternals is a whole new Superhero saga which brings you a bunch of unseen caracters and if you have been following Marvel Cinematic Universe since the beginning then this could be a new series to look out for. But wait, can you hold onto your patience for some time? I mean about 160 minutes with 3D glasses beginning to give you a headache? If yes, then go for it. The story written by Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo is definitely unique, and full of heart. In 156 minutes, Externals hardly makes you seat through tightly but when it does, it does it fine. That slow pick-up to the main plot was expected because they had to introduce new characters without giving early spoilers. Eternals stars an ensemble cast including Gemma Chan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Lia McHugh, Brian Tyree Henry, Lauren Ridloff, Barry Keoghan, Don Lee, Harish Patel, Kit Harington, Salma Hayek, and Angelina Jolie. Eternals is also Marvel's most diverse film by far, a bar that, while being so low as to be easily stepped over, is still an achievement to note, belated as it is in the studio's decade-plus-long run. Chloé Zhao did such an amazing job directing, making the phase 4 of marvel for there fans to love and future generations to see. ""We have loved these people since the day we arrived. When you love something, you protect it.""",Eternals
268,lukerandall,Absolutely poor,6,6 November 2021,"What a waste of nearly 3 hours, no sense of direction.. the film was literally pointless!Poor script, carried by a good cast.. other than that it's a complete waste of time.Barry Keoghan was great throughout!Genuinely disappointed after such a long wait.",Eternals
269,IsThatJoseph21,The flashbacks should've been the entire movie,5,7 November 2021,"Out of the three MCU movies that came out this year, Eternals is the first one I felt like reviewing. Black Widow and Shang Chi were fine, but honestly, there wasn't much to say about them. With Eternals, I have a lot to say.As the title in my review states, Eternals would've been a lot better if the entire movie was like the flashbacks. Showing the Eternals living in different time periods seems like a unique concept that they could've done a lot with.In terms of structure, you could have the characters arrive at Earth in the beginning of the movie, then split off after their mission ends. Then, the rest of the movie would've been like an anthology, with each segment following a different Eternal in a different time period. For instance, one segment could've followed Sersai in ancient Egypt, while another segment could've followed Ikaris in the Roman Empire. Then, the end of the movie could take place in the present, with an event that reunites all of the Eternals and sets up a sequel.Another aspect of the movie that could've been improved is the number of Eternals. Ten characters are way too much. Reduce the Eternals to five members, so each character gets more time to be developed. Personally, the characters I'd keep are Sersai, Ikaris, Sprite, Kingo, and Druig. I'd also get rid of that weird subplot where Sprite has a crush on Ikaris.Overall, Eternals would've been more interesting if the entire movie showed the Eternals living in different time periods. Instead of following the standard MCU formula, Eternals could've provided something unique to the superhero genre. I give Eternals a 5/10.",Eternals
270,nihonjin-63031,First impression,5,4 November 2021,"I am in the middle of the movie and i am writing the review.........First of all, congratulations for the work and the effort of everyone from the production.The movie is very good visually, but doesn't have the progression and the dynamics to keep you in your seat as the other MCU movies. Lacks the spirit of Iron man 1.I know that the characters are too strong and developed for their time on Earth and can't develop more than they had, but still something is missing. I don't feel the need to wait for the end of the movie. I just wait to see what they have created.Can't wait to see SPIDEY.",Eternals
271,jtq-56435,Marvel's Justice League,9,5 November 2021,"Eternals is a beautiful movie with heart and in 2 hours and 30 minutes does a better job of expanding on lore and setting up bigger things than unfortunately ZSJL did in a 4 hours (Still great, a 8/10 for me). This movie is the perfect length, it has jawdropping action, great comedy, and even twists that no one could have expected from the trailers. Chloe Zhao in my opinion is worthy to continue this series and has truly shined once again with such a heavy task on her Director plate. The Eternals themselves are layered and have their own desires and needs themselves and you will appreciate them all in their own way and feel you've taken a journey with them, the audience I was with seemed to enjoy every bit of it. The dialogue around this movie has been vile, especially by certain YouTube channels I will not mention but rest assured, the diversity here is not in your face and no is here for ""representation"" sake. I cannot wait to see it again soon, it really blew me away and I left with the smile that I tend to always have walking out of a Marvel movie.. isn't that what it's about?",Eternals
272,Aura_Q,Finally! An MCU Film for Adults,8,9 November 2021,"Finally, we get an MCU film for adults. The MCU has for far too long bored me with its child driven films up until the magnificent Infinity Wars. Feels good to forget about the spiders, wasps, men with shields and iron suits.Perfectly set storyline and great cinematography, this new Eternals phase seems to be really promising. Hopefully they will never cross this with the other childish characters.",Eternals
273,malbanese,May be better suited to the DC universe.,3,4 November 2021,"So let me start by saying I am a fan. Comics have played an integral part of my life growing up with the likes of Spiderman, The Avengers and Doctor Strange among too many more to list, and I remember back in the 80's and 90's, studio attempts at making poor films like Spiderman and Captain America. I also remember being so excited when I had the chance to watch them, but also disappointed they didn't live up to the imaginative creativity of the original comic books. How could they?The lack of technology, cgi, special effects and budget constraints (back then, no one wanted to see superhero films). With that, we were satisfied with what we got, because we knew it was the best we could get for the time.Fast forward a couple of decades and we now expect much more. We have been spoiled with amazing adaptations of comics we loved in our youth, and they are brought to life on screen with the same creativity and passion we loved them for. The Avengers saga, Spiderman films, Thor, Ant Man, Doctor Strange, Captain America and Captain Marvel, to name a few, all living up to expectations and sometimes exceeding them.Then there is the Eternals. What feels like a cash grab riding on the coattails of Marvels success. A CGI extravaganza that pushes the 2 and half hour limit, but could have been shorter or longer (depending on who was making it). In the hands of Chloe Zhao, it feels like it was falling through her fingers. Don't get me wrong, technically the film looks good. But the film feels forced at times and hollow at others. The characters, although well defined are boring and waning in their own existence. The potential was there. I liked some of what I saw, but I left the cinema feeling annoyed, unloved, taken for a ride. I expected more. And I have a right to expect more because I have seen what Marvel films bring to the table, and I am familiar with the feeling and emotion I get from those other films, that take care and show love for the material.If the Eternals come back for another film, I don't know if I'd care for it. It would require a whole new direction for me to be interested to go back for another foray.",Eternals

The time span involved means that the film covers a lot of ground and though it's a long film It didn't feel like it. I love the tie-in to periods in our history. It's a shame we didn't see more of Kit Harrington or Lauren Ridloff, both of whom are great actors- I hope they get more screen time moving forward.

Acting of the Actors/actresses were much to the point, no one was a disappointment.CGI was good like any other marvel movie, not outstanding but good.

281,rfloom,I genuinely feel like I watched a different film than the critics,8,6 November 2021,"I don't get how a film like Ant-Man & the Wasp can get the kind of reviews it did while this gets the kind it did. That movie was so bland and boring and forgettable. I think the same for the MCU Spider-Man films as well as Thor Ragnarok. I do not understand what makes those good films at all. I feel like such little imagination went into them. While I think representation is important, it doesn't resonate with me personally being a straight white male. So all that aside, I seriously thought this was a freaking awesome movie. I saw so many reviews saying it was the least fun MCU film or way too exposition heavy... and it was confusing how it jumped back and forth through time. I found it to be a pretty simple and straightforward story to follow. The only real exposition dump was when Ashirem or whatever the main celestial name is was explaining everything to Sersi. Otherwise I never felt overloaded with information. I thought the action scenes were insane! Makari has the best speedster special effects I've seen. So much fun to watch. The story had some solid twists, maybe nothing revolutionary, but very few MCU films have that... I don't know man. That ending battle was awesome, the deviants, while they looked like creatures from Pandora in Avatar, still had their own unique feel to them. No I didn't follow absolutely everything, it'll take another viewing for me to do that probably, but overall I thought this was a fantastic entry in the MCU. How in God's name this is the lowest scored film I have no idea. I absolutely loved Shang Chi and put that in my top 5 MCU films and after my first viewing of Eternals I genuinely feel like this is pretty high up in my ranking as well. I officially could not care less what critics say about movies anymore. They also said the post credit scenes were insane, which they weren't at all. I guess if you're a REAL die hard Marvel fan you'll like them. But if you are, you've already seen the movie so yeah. If a celebrity cameo is a reason to flip out than yikes.",Eternals
282,jmf_taborda,"So, basically one of the best movies of the MCU so far",9,8 November 2021,"This movie is simply amazing. The visuals, the vfx, the costumes, the deviants, omg it's like DUNE but for superheroes.I've read every single eternals comics do its not really fair, but all the issues the people I spoke about the movie had, were misunderstandings or things they didn't connect to each other. And maybe thats the one issue this movie has... It not for marvel beginners, nor for MCU exclusive person's. It's so much more, the connections, the relationships, the powers, the rules that the eternals live by and are controlled by.. it's an amazing job by the most promising Director in the business! Thank God Feige for this movie! Can't wait for the next one.",Eternals

I saw so many things about this movie being overly ""woke"" and trying to spread itself too thin with all of the characters. I can honestly say I did not go in with high hopes. I felt like those reviews and articles almost stopped me from watching a movie that I really did enjoy. I think the ""boundaries"" pushed were not shoved and ended being tastefully handled. I also didn't feel lost in the amount of characters. We actually went as a group of 12, very different, people, all of which really enjoyed it.

The performance was amazing, visuals, were fantastic actions sequences were dope. Gemma Chan's is the real MVP of this movie, not gonna spoil anything but her character Sersi is G. O. A. T.Another standout performance was given by Kumail. Najiani and Richard Madden. Other actors did a really good job but these two were standout for me. Another great character was Harish Patel who plays Kingo's valet, that guy was really fun and I hope we see him more in MCU.The only con I felt was the sex scene which I felt was absolutely unnecessary but other than that, this movie is really good. It's highly entertaining. Just forget about the critics and watch it.",Eternals
287,oszajcakk,Not for Marvel fans,6,8 November 2021,"It's not your typical Marvel movie, that's for sure. Is it a good movie? Not really. It does have good moments, but the story is to weak and some character's have basically glorified cameo. It should have been made into a show or just concentrate on more important Eternals. Killing some of them of early in the movie doesn't help with getting know them better. There is now real villain and everything seems wasted. It's more of very long end credit scene or trailer before Eternals 2. This supposed to be the biggest movie of the year, but it probably end up as biggest disappointment.",Eternals
288,shaughnpatrickrice-19191,Better than most are giving it credit,7,5 November 2021,"Has a rough start, poor handling of exposition and some forced comedy but over all is really enjoyable.

289,faraazattar,Better than Black Widow and Venom 2,8,7 November 2021,Not as bad as critics are saying but not a blockbuster as well. The story was very mediocre and felt it was rushed it would have been better if the movie could have been done in 2 parts like Infinity war and endgame with proper introduction to all the characters and their origin especially Arshem. But I still enjoyed this film all thanks to Chloe Zhao's direction skills and the humor felt very balanced to me and not to forget that this was one of the best visually creative movie in the MCU.,Eternals
290,nvmensah,A response to all the low ratings,10,3 November 2021,"Eternals was a masterpiece!It was very different from what marvel often does, but wasn't that what they told us. And from my experience, it wasn't really in a bad way. As I walked into the cinema I was expecting something really different and that was also what I saw, it was truly a great experience and I did appreciate it. There was no reason for someone to give this movie a 1 star, what was it that made it receive such low ratings? This is a 200+ million budget film of course it's not going to be horrible, the lowest rating acceptable would be about a 6/7, with the reasoning being that it's not anyones cup of tea but this really isn't that bad of a movie. It's just not what marvel regularly brings us, and I can understand the reasoning for not liking what they brought us. Try to receive the movie with some cup of tea, as it really isn't a bad movie. Don't ruin the rating by rating it with a 1. Because it really isn't a movie deserving of a 1 star rating.And do we not appreciate the performance of the great actors in this movie and the amazing plot twists that nobody expected. The end credit scenes were although short truly amazing as well.",Eternals

Although this really happened, I think it is a good Marvel Movie that helps to explain why Kevin Feige's MCU is so
screwy.If you like how the recent MCU Movies have been 'rewritten' to depart from the Comic Books, partly to develop the characters and make the story more interesting, then you will enjoy ""The Eternals""If Brad Pitt does join the MCU, maybe the people who fall asleep watching this, will stay awake for him. ; )",Eternals

295,martabarovier,I had high expectations for this film and they were met!,8,10 November 2021,"The visual effects are definitely the most awe-inducing factor of the movie, along with the cinematography. I loved everything about the fight scenes, from the choreographies to the technology and powers. The soundtrack is a bit confusing sometimes, it alternates beautiful pieces of music to melodies that sound disconnected. I don't know how to feel about it. The characters are likeable and diverse. The jokes are sometimes a bit too much. The LGBTQ+ representation is a breath of fresh air in a franchise such as Marvel. I liked that the main character is not one of the big names in the cast. Still, I feel like they could have used Angelina Jolie more. I was also a bit disappointed that Kit Harington didn't have as much screen time as one might deduce from the trailer. Overall I think the story was very clear despite the multiple flashbacks, and I'm relieved that I didn't leave the theatre feeling like I missed something or had questions left unanswered. I would have liked the film to be just a little shorter with some adjustments to the pacing. The two post-credit scenes are very exciting!",Eternals
296,Couchkik20,A feast of emotions,9,8 November 2021,"This is the first Marvel movie I want to watch again in a theater.It's so beautiful and complex. Yes it's not perfect as if any Superhero movie was perfect. Too many new characters, a VERY abstract villain, silly flashbacks and the acting can feel too theatrical at times. But it has engaging characters, some funny scenes instead of continuous one liners and real emotional moments. It expands the story possibilities into a cosmic world and for once has something resembling a true love story.It was weirdly reminiscent of the good aspects of Twilight to me.People need to stop relying on RT critics numbers because this movie is far superior to many recent Marvel movie. Antman & the Wasp was a big low for me with boring new characters, the most insipid villain and barely any action. I hated Captain Marvel and its predictable twists and ugly action scenes, Black Widow was more generic than a Mission Impossible sequel and I thought the Falcon/ Winter soldier show was a total disaster of forced wokeness and pseudo political issues.Yes the Marvel movies we all expect are like Shang Chi: shiny action, wild chases, down to Earth characters with a joke a minute, OTT CGI of monsters or robots and a vague family drama we can all relate too. But I don't think Eternals is an accident, I think it offers an alternative and a more mellow adult vibe to the usual fairground rides...Sure it would have worked better as a Disney + TV show because you probably needed 5/6 hours to truly tell this story with a proper pace, understand the characters and feel the sense of what they went through during thousand of years rather than just jumping between flashbacks, character introductions and Deviants scenes until the clunky rushed climax.But I absolutely loved the effort. (plus I can't wait for Black Knight!)",Eternals
297,MouazHajBakri,"Emotional, human, and epic. Chloé Zhao breaths fresh air into this brave franchise and its embraced need to evolve",8,7 November 2021,"Chloé Zhao is phenomenal; Her take of the Eternals is human and grounded and sentimental...She breathed life into the movie, and the result was a dynamic emotional epic, that was beautifully slow at the right moments, magnifying its characters, making them warm and important. And i think she had achieved the difficult task of interweaving an original style with this huge franchise.I think Eternals stand as a prime example of why Marvel is so successful, and why they are just better than what many perceive them, and how a pragmatic success is best made when the artist is at the core, as is the case here.I believe the critical views of this particular picture are mostly biased, somewhat superficial, and are stemming from some serious insecurities.Watch the Eternals, its a genuine beauty, a poignant picture, and another triumph of its world.",Eternals

299,SanciR,A better team than the Avengers?,9,6 November 2021,"I don't understand the amount of hate this movie is getting... specially when I would consider it to be one of the best movies they've put out since Endgame. This movie feels different, yes, but is it a bad thing? It IS a superhero movie, with cool action and effects... but it also does something special by slowing the pace down a bit and focussing on the characters and their relationships. This is what I think the movie excels at, basically doing a beautiful job showcasing the humanity of each one of the characters. It is a movie about a family, something that the Avengers have been telling us they are for years, but unlike them, this group actually feels like they love each other; and so, when conflict arises between them, it feels complex and nuanced. Though the plot stakes are huge already, it's the emotional stakes that are given a chance to shine... and I was able to enjoy that a lot. The cast is large, and so it's unfortunate that a few characters didn't have a chance to be fully explored, but I wouldn't say it was a true downside. After all, the story is not about one character, but about them as a unit, and we do get to focus on those who drive the conflict.There are many aspects I loved about this film. For once, the humor was an other aspect I enjoyed, specially the character of Karun (who I believe stole the show). The way they play into that easy family banter was great, and I felt like all the characters had great chemistry in that aspect. What can I say other than, all the jokes landed and had the entire cinema laughing. Of course, I also grew to care for most of the characters as well... because dammit, most of them are just wholesome and lovable. The big dilema and existencial questions tackled were very interesting too. By the end, you can understand all sides, and I find that to be very cool (it's not just good vs evil, it's way more complex than that). Even the characters who are supposed to be seen as ""bad"", have motivations that make sense, and could be considered righteous.. It's great stuff.Overall, I am very disappointed to see all the hate directed towards this movie. Sadly, it was bound to happen that the most diverse movie marvel has ever put out would get the most backlash, but it's still hard to see. All I can do is wonder how anyone could look at a movie that celebrates humanity and think including as much humanity as posible is a downside.Maybe this movie will not be beloved by all, but I liked it and I'll shout it from the rooftops.",Eternals
300,simonanter,Best marvel movie for me,10,9 November 2021,I'll start with: this movie probably isn't for you if you expect marvel formula and action scenes that get bigger and bigger. It is completely different from every other mcu movie and that's really refreshing and something that should happen more often.The movie explores the life of the eternals and their personal change over thousands of years. It shines with its ability of putting different beings into the spotlight of becoming humans and explores the variety of characters that are formed over the years. This movie with multiple characters is more intimate and tragic than every other mcu movie out there that features only one main character. Zhao manages to draw beautiful characters in such a short time and combined with her teams skill in cinematography and the actors ability to act every nuance of the characters she manages to bring an incredible experience of a movie onto the screen that I hope we will see more frequent in the next few years.,Eternals
301,noahbmayfield,"Frankly, I'm Shocked",9,5 November 2021,"Perhaps its because I had my expectations set so low, or maybe I'm just a sucker for a universe-building movie, but I can honestly say that I absolutely adore this film. After seeing the mass criticism of ""Eternals,"" I did expect to enjoy the film from an audience standpoint, just not a critical one. But, ever since I left the theater, I've been scratching my head trying to figure out why this film has been so bombarded with negative reviews.For starters, the film dives into some remarkably deep topics that I haven't seen in many movies, especially nothing from the MCU. Most deep conversations and emotional connections in cinema deal with love, death or discrimination. Eternals manages to pull in the audience's attention by showing us the beauty of life as we know it, something director Chloé Zhao does amazingly. The film doesn't feel like an MCU episode, and I'm honestly glad it didn't. THIS is where Marvel begins branching out to create beautiful new ideas.Something that really stood out to me was Thena's arc. Yes, it was well written, but we mainly have Angelina Jolie to thank for Thena's emotional rollercoaster. Jolie proves once again just how well she can put on a preformance, and thus Thena's journey ends up being one of the most beautiful parts of the film. Likewise, you could make a case for almost any of the Eternals to end up as your favorite.Perhaps the film's one flaw, being a little more humor than necessary, holds it back from being a 10/10 addition to Marvel, but even those humorous moments add a lively atmosphere to the scenes.There isn't much more I can say without spoiling any major plot points, but as of my first viewing, I'm quite shocked at how beautiful, tragic and well done this film is. I'm disappointed to see the negative reception it's received.",Eternals

What I liked the most about it is that it doesn't rely too much on the past events, and keeps its focus on the main storyline, and yeah there were some references made here and there, but still casual mcu watcher will be able to apprehend.

312,Ellimof,I need an explanation...,8,5 November 2021,"After seeing the critic reviews, I was expecting a mixed bag from the movie when I walked in. Though, I'd still give it a chance as I'm a big fan of the MCU. If it's bad, whatever, I didn't care for the Eternals in the comics anyway.So the movie starts off and during the first 30 minutes or so, I thought there was some pacing issues and I got a little worried that the critics were right, but once the movie settled, I was locked in. I found myself really enjoying the movie. I was then anticipating this moment where the movie falls off the rails to explain the reviews...but that moment never came for me. Actually, I found the movie continuing to get better. The story was growing on me, the characters were growing on me, the action was growing on me. Then the movie ended. I was completely confused what was wrong with the movie. I remember seeing some reviews saying they were bored. So knowing Chloe Zhao as a director, I thought maybe there wasn't much action or humor, but there was plenty of action and humor. The message and stakes of the movie was nice, and I thought it had good emotion to it. Now, I don't think it's a masterpiece, and there was a lot to take in, but I never found myself confused or uninterested. Maybe for the casual movie goer, it's a little too much superhero for them, but so are other MCU movies. I think Eternals might even be more Sci-Fi than most Marvel movies. Either way, the movie is a good time regardless of what critics say.I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact this movie is currently in the 50s on Rotten Tomatoes. To put it in perspective, Venom: Let There be Carnage has a 60%...I really just feel bad for the people that worked on this movie...they should be proud of it instead of seeing so many negative reviews.",Eternals

It made me sad. It made me laugh. I lost track of time and that was a great thing. For Marvel lovers, this movie really delivers. It ties into everything we know and unlocks so much more of the universe we know and love. I am stoked to see where these characters end up as far as the rest of the MCU goes. Feige knows! Chloe did her thing!",Eternals
314,rodstohogs,"I wanted to like this so much, I watched it twice.",3,8 November 2021,"Im a huge Marvel fan and have seen every movie over and over. Unfortunately, I just could not get into this movie. Maybe they tried too hard to character build, or too hard to show diversity. Dont get me wrong, I love that they tried to include everyone from each race, as well as having someone who is deaf, and they even a gay character. All of that effort I could appreciate, though those efforts seemed to fall a little flat by making the main character a stronger super hero who is white, as well as the goddess of war who also is white. Still overall not my issue with this movie as it was a decent attempt to include us all.My issues are with how boring the movie was and how much they overdid and drug out the boring parts. Also, all the glowing magical stuff which never bothered me before, finally also went too far. This movie was like the old really bad DC movies that tried too hard and fell flat. It totally missed the Marvel magic recipe for me. I did have to give it another try by seeing it twice, as I did doze off a few times my first visit. Seeing it twice was every worse and even more hokey then it was when I slept through parts of it. I'm guessing Marvel will make up for it with the next one, as we should not need 2 hours of getting to know everyone next time.The CG of course was pretty good, a bit too much magic and glowing hocus pocus. But it was OK and did have some excitement to it. Still, they tried too hard, I think. I actually started to feel sorry for marvel.Although disappointed in this movie, I still cant put my finger on all the things in this movie that bothered me. Too many to list maybe? As even the jokes were not quite the same and did not always have the perfect timing as in previous marvel movies. I feel like if Marvel continues down this road, the magic and secret recipe it once had will fade away and it will be DC, who will then be on top.",Eternals

This should have been released on Disney+ as a original movie under the Marvel's tab instead of a theatrical release. At its 2½ runtime it is about an hour too long! It is boring as soo unnecessary. All of the ""superheros"" were weak and make you wonder why they even exist when there are other more capable hero's (and Gods even like Thor) who actually show up to do work and save humanity.

320,parksiet,A Breath of Fresh Air for the MCU,9,5 November 2021,"I loved Eternals. Holy crap the critics REALLY got this one wrong. It's a solid masterpiece of a movie and one of the most beautiful, unique and innovative films that Marvel has ever produced, thanks to Chloe Zhao's visionary talent. It isn't your average Marvel movie, hell it doesn't even feel like one. And that's why I love it! It's a breath of fresh air and shows the MCU taking bold, new risks, instead of just using the same type of storytelling. I love the creative choices that were made and how they all make it stand out in such a special way from the rest of the MCU, from the dense mythology, gorgeous visuals and more emotional, character driven storyline. It really taps in to the work of Jack Kirby, from a story and even visual perspective. This movie is still blowing my mind, its one that is getting better and better the more I think about, process and digest it, and I'm sure it will only get better with more viewings! (And god I cannot wait to see it again!) The film is ambitious, but handles everything so perfectly, which Chloe Zhao deserves every praise for! Her direction is stunningly beautiful, incredibly strong and she brings her very nuanced style to the MCU. I love how she puts story and character above the action, and while not one of the action is as big as some sequences from other films, what we get really works for the story! The film has a scope that is so ambitious and epic, feeling a lot like Zack Snyder's Justice League, which for me is a great thing. Zhao's script is also really well done, the mythology is rich and complex, the story is emotional, pure and heartfelt with so much humanity imbued into the characters. The characters were really fantastic and I fell in love with all of them very quickly. I really liked how the movie made every character feel important and valued, and with a cast of 10 main characters I found Zhao balanced their screen time and actions/conflicts really well. One of the best parts of the film is the dynamics and interplay between the characters. The Eternals are all essentially gods, but Zhao, alongside her stunning cast, did such a good job at bringing the humanity to each of their personalities and stories. It's a complex story with differing character motivations and ideologies, and I loved how the end battle was essentially a battle of ideologies as the Eternals sought to develop their own sense of autonomy from the Celestials. I also thought some of the dialogue at the start was a little iffy, but as the movie got going it got better. I loved the humour throughout, there were many really funny moments for sure! And like I said, the cast was perfect, each of the actors brought a warmth and sense of life to their roles. I especially loved Kumail Nanjiani, Richard Madden and Brian Tyree Henry, but it was clearly Gemma Chan's movie. Barry Keoghan was also such a surprise! Kit Harington had a smaller role than expected but I am so excited to see where his character goes moving forward! And that's another thing I loved about the movie; it reinvigorated my excitement for the future of the MCU and showed me how different and new it could get! The world building in the film is excellent, it really fleshes out the cosmic side of the MCU in such a rich and intricate way, making the MCU feel much more grand and complex. The movie essentially is what Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" wishes it was, and tells that sort of story but from the perspective of the engineers, which in this movie were the Celestials. I loved how they handled the Celestial scenes, especially in how they showed the physical scale and massiveness of Arishem compared to Ajax and Sersi. The visuals themselves, throughout the entire movie, are absolutely stunning and gorgeous. Chloe Zhao is truly gifted with a sense to capture the perfect shot, with stunning lighting and colour. Its easily the best looking MCU film, and I loved the natural feel that the on-location shooting did for the film. Its truly a feast for the eyes and felt so visually rich because it wasn't all CGI environments and was so brightly lit. I really admire the effort put into the cinematography for this film, and even the CGI looked stunning! The costumes also looked excellent and were nicely colourful! The design of the deviants was really cool, but unfortunately the characters themselves are somewhat wasted and served as better plot devices than villains, but luckily the story has a clever twist later on in the film. The overall villains of the movie are a lot more ambiguous than in a usual comic book movie, and that really worked for me. I really enjoyed the hell out of this movie, and I have to say it is definitely one of the best films that Marvel has ever produced. It doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, it is very much a Chloe Zhao film and that is easily its biggest strength! Please go see it and form your own opinions, I can see how some may see it as divisive, but I was completely swept away by it! It's a triumph; a slow burning story that is epic in nature, beautiful in character development, and has gorgeous visuals. It's something the MCU hasn't seen yet, and has major implications for the future. I respect it alone for the bold creative risks Marvel took in making this film, and hope we see more experimentation from them like this! Not only that, but wow Chloe Zhao is truly a force of nature and proves she can handle a blockbuster! I loved it, its so fresh and really something truly special and transformative for Marvel, and wow it only gets better with time! (And woah, those end credit scenes were pretty exciting!)",Eternals

322,gabrielgarbagni,Cosmology Subversion,7,8 November 2021,"There are many things that could be said about this movie.As a story that takes place in the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, Eternals is certainly very experimental compared to the others. The directing by Chloé Zhao is very well-crafted, so is the photography and the whole aesthetic of each environment.The characters are loosely-based on the comic book versions they take inspiration from, even though only three are really developed and memorable: them being Gemma Chan as Sersi, Richard Madden as Ikaris and Angelina Jolie as Thena.Everything that happens feels genuine and natural, for the most part: the progression of the story, the conflict between characters as well as the sequences involving the Celestials.The pacing could have been handled in a different way. Sometimes, the movie gets too slow as it gets harder to connect to what's going on. Also the tone of the movie is not as cohesive as you would expect. The visual effects are spectacular during certain scenes, while are just okay during others.In the end, this movie manages to expand the cosmology of the MCU, thanks to its brilliant twists and turns, but is perhaps too dark and gloomy to be appreciated by the majority of the public. It's a blockbuster flick that works to a certain extent.",Eternals

After few minutes I got bit bored but then suddenly I realised that this was needed. Chloe Zhao built up the story in a very beautiful way. The BGM, VFX & CGI, choreography, camera work are awesome. It felt so refreshing to me. The emotional aspects were on point. And comedy ? Kumail Nanjiani and Harish Patel(our beloved Indian actor/comedian of 90's movies) definitely nailed it. They always caught our attention. Top to bottom the movie was so perfect. I think the Deviants were needed to be explored more. And yes the credit scenes ? Specially the mid credit scene !

329,klotzilla-1,Enjoyable but...,5,9 November 2021,"Frustrating film. Are these characters superheroes or gods or demigods or robots or angels? Who knows, who' cares, right? I dug it mostly but the flaws are almost too many to list.I'll start with the actors. Kumail Nanjiani (Kingo), Bryan Tyree Henry (Phastos), and Ma Dong-seok (Gilgamesh) are the only characters that I felt worked. The leads were all flat, especially Gemma Chan (Sersi) and Richard Madden (Ikaris). Angelina Jolie (Athena) is underused, and Kit Harrington is barely in the film. The others are mostly forgettable. For a film about characters, the lack of real chemistry is a 2 hour 36 minute problem.The plot is good enough for a comic book movie, trying to stop a God (pardon me, a Celestial) from being born and thereby destroying the cool planet The Avengers have saved repeatedly.The nominal villains are monsters called Deviants that are about as threatening as any CG monsters. I thought they sucked. Any action flick is judged by its villains. These never threaten.So far every Marvel flick has had it's ""HELL YEAH!"" moment where the embattled heroes finally rise above their enemy. This one never even gets close to a moment like that,Zhao was the wrong choice for director. But the script was bad at times. Mostly this mess was Zhao's fault.",Eternals

331,ryanbrandon57,Will split the room. I really liked it,8,4 November 2021,"Without a doubt the most visually stunning and drama rich marvel film. The VFX are on another level, although the finale is a bit too ""grand"" for lack of a better word, the first 90% of the movie for the most part was quite grounded and slower than most MCU movies which was very welcome as it suited the style of this story and characters, plus gave us something new and refreshing to the franchise.The big finale was classic Disney, in a way that was a little disappointing, a massive CGI sequence that felt a bit out of place from the rest of this brave movie, they somewhat chickened out and were too afraid to let the film climax on its own terms. A very in-your-face reminder that MCU have a formula, there are a few moments like this.I stilled loved it, the speedster looked so good The Flash movie really has to bring it to satisfy now. The amount of beautiful shots have no right to be in a MCU movie it was wonderful. The deep and complicated relationships within a diverse and interesting group of characters makes the movie immersive and relatable. It also has some profound questions at its core. I can't wait to see these characters again, Phase 4 has completely exceeded my expectations so far.One terrible after credit scene that made me very nervous for the future of the MCU (not funny or cool). And a second one that is really intriguing and exciting.",Eternals

This is Marvel trying something new and I'm here for it.",Eternals

336,gpapakyprianos,A REALLY GOOD MOVIE AND THE REALLY BIASED AND PROBLEMATIC CRITICS,8,5 November 2021,"This movie is heavily bombarded by biased critics and people who are used to watching marvel movies as kids' movies. Eternals was a grown movie with a very serious tone to it and all I can say is finally. Chloe Zhao really took some Marvel aspects and gave them a clear natural look, going away from the formula of every MCU film. I loved the extensive use of on-location shoots and the very well-done VFX that blended with their natural surroundings. The plot, like in EVERY MOVIE, had its problems but the twists and the grand plan made up for every mistake. A visually stunning film with a great music score that is meant to be seen on the biggest screen.",Eternals
337,ohadlu,Could've been better,6,4 November 2021,"For a movie based on Jack Kirby's vision, it misfires:In the comics it's filled with vibrant colors and really different setting than other stories of it's time and in the movie it was completely toned down, in avengers (2012) you had more colors.The movie was slow in pace, going back and forth in past and present of the characters, you couldn't figure out if you're in the beginning, middle or end of the film, so it felt somewhat plotless.. they could've done something completely different with the celestials that could actually be connected to what we've seen in the Loki Disney+ show or something to connect to guardians 3 but instead they said ""let's talk about feelings with almost 0 action""
I didn't had problem with the love scenes or even the first openly gay couple in the MCU, I just didn't care or thought of it as a crucial part of the plot but it's okay...Of course you can't make any movie today without gender swap some characters but, for those who haven't read the comics like myself (but I've read briefly and seen what it supposed to look like) it doesn't really matter, it just seemed like a normal character..Overall, I wanted to see one thing, got the other and I'm just disappointed, phase 4 is now fueled by almost no plot and no plan.",Eternals

And I always see that as some bs cos most mcu films look alike. Then I saw Eternals and i truly saw how different the film is from not just mcu films but any other COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER MADE.Visually, it was gorgeous, they put in the work for the visuals and costume. There are some shots you will wish to reverse and see it again cos it looked beautiful.Not all character gets a fledged out story and that's fine cos it is a 2 1/2 hour film and can't have all the characters developed but i thought every character in likeable even the ones you will gradually hate.I suggest you go see the film yourself and give your own ratings.",Eternals

I loved how the director always used actual sunlight, it makes the movie much more alive. I loved the jokes since it was a marvel movie to. The story was good and it was actually pretty better then Black Widow. The length was perfect. But i did not liked the fact that they made deviants like animals. They was acting on their instincts. The post credits was so good, it was such a nice marvel movie. I don't think its a 6.9 its like 7.5. I can say you need to watch this on theaters.",Eternals

Also Kit Harrington is in the movie for about three minutes. The characters, oh boy... most of them are really uninteresting and boring (Sprite, Druig, Thena, Makkari) had to Google all of their names while writing this cause I really couldn't care less about them. For me the most interesting ones were Ikaris (potential wasted) and Kingo. Also this movie seriously lacks an interesting villain. 6/10.",Eternals

Story wise there were a lot of expositions and less action, I didn't really mind it because of the historical stamps they go through. Sersi's power was by far my favorite.

Eternals is an exceptionally beautiful Film that tries to live up to the great expectations of a massive action epic, but is mostly let down by a bright but unstable cast of enigmatic characters who try to pass it off as thematic with emotional depth. The magnitude of Eternals is unlike anything I've seen in the MCU so far, but it also results in a film that just has too much on its plate. While I admire the MCU for taking a chance by offering an ambitious and unique narrative, the script and storytelling just did not live up to the film's ambitious ideals.",Eternals

The truth is it's somewhere inbetween.I'm not a fan of the more 'cosmic', out-there Marvel stories so I went into this with low expectations ... but was pleasantly surprised. I would echo some of the other comments I've see in that some of the diversity seems crow-barred in for the sake of it - I mean, if you're creating a super-hero then why make them only able to communicate thru sign language?? And why make one 14 forever!?? Doesn't make sense.It also seemed odd that they left a bloody great marbelised celestial in the middle of the planet, with bits poking out here and there ... how does that work!? Especially when Sersi made a point of saying that she could just turn stuff to air.They 'Irish' one was a bawbag as was Sprite. Both quite annoying.Not Marvels best but I was entertained. Hung around for the credits scenes and needn't have bothered. By this time you need to be a real comics nerd to get the references. Not like the good old days when they got you super-excited for the next movie. Thor's hammer...OMG!!",Eternals
353,avebray,Wonderful Visual Movie,9,6 November 2021,"Eternals is now in my top 10 Marvel movies. It's a new direction for the MCU and a new style, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The plot was easy to follow and the characters were easy to love and connect with. The style of the movie was clean and almost abstract which was interesting to experience. The fighting sequences and strengths of the characters were powerful and very entertaining to watch. I love the dynamics seen between the characters. My favorite thing about Eternals though, was the cinematography. The visuals and setting were insane, each shot being mesmerizing to look at. The storyline was interesting and had plot twists that left me shocked. I found myself getting emotional along with the characters. Overall the movie as a whole was well done, but it's not the best the MCU has created. Eternals makes me hopeful for the new phase of Marvel.",Eternals

Like my 11 yo back then when he watched Captain Marvel (me and wife enjoyed it).If you expect a marvel/avengers movie, nope this is not it, it's not yet another super hero movie, it feels more like a 'movie' but not a 'super hero comic bookish movie'.The end of the story was a bit too artificial but overall not bad, and acting was solid, but the character growth can be stronger, especially with Sprite and Thena. Sometimes it's hard to feel what they feel if you know what I mean.Overall I give it 7/10 that's cos it could be better (pace/story telling) but will definitely watch again.Look forward to the sequel as well.",Eternals

It provides enriched cinematography and dutifully examines the emotional temperament of each eternal, along with the nature of their existence.Eternals is essentially Marvel lore, its religion, and is treated as such. It's a fundamental keystone to the evolution of Marvels universe and is regarded as such. As is the case with most religions, there can be some boring parts. But they're only boring if you're wanting something more than emotional character development.This is a regular marvel movie because it has the responsibility of being something more. They've introduced wonderful memorable characters, enhanced the depth of the universe, and invigorated interest in the stories to come.If you're a real marvel fan, you'll understand the necessity of this type of story and will be excited to see how it ties into the rest of the universe in the stories to come.",Eternals

This was the first fourth wave MCU product that actually made me excited for what comes in the future. The twists actually surprised me. I do wish they'd break from the formal of inserting jokes in scenes that don't need them, but the cast really did feel like a family and every character's actions were understandable and justified.

Ask for the externals it was more of a drama / superhero film, anyways there was so much this film could of explored but chose not to and there answer to why they didn't help the avengers with thanos was almost like they didn't feel like it, or they couldn't intervene but other characters did intervene living there mundane human life, anyways for me I give it a 6 because it's worth a watch for the visual effects alone but I won't be watching this one again anytime soon.",Eternals

Maybe.If we're talking Marvel films in general, Eternals is certainly better than Fan4stic or X-Men: Apocalypse. If we're talking MCU films, it's a bit better than Thor: The Dark World and Captain Marvel, but not as good as Iron Man 3.The characters are not bad in of themselves. In fact they're all pretty interesting. It's the specific ways they're used in the film that go from ok to terrible.The plot is a mess. It seems to work until you finish the film and realize how bad it was. Two villains is hard to pull off. They did not pull it off. Killing Gilgamesh and leaving Nanjiani out of the ending were missed opportunities. Making Ikaris the villain and not just developing Kro was a mistake. Ikaris flying into the sun was probably one of the most on the nose, ridiculous things I've ever seen.

374,masterdeo,Best MCU movie of the year,8,7 November 2021,"Eternals has one of the best opening scenes in a marvel movie that is eye candy for an Eternals fan. Visuals are impressive particularly with the powers and how they look. The non linear storytelling will work for some but not for other (it worked for me personally).The celestials looked amazing and the film has a large scale. The two post credit scenes are great for the future of different parts of the movie and the ending makes me want Eternals 2 as fast as possible.Where the film lets me down is with the twist with Ikaris. As an Eternals fan I think it was a poor interpretation of this character and killing him off was not how I saw Ikaris when imagining him from the comics. However possible sequels may allow for this problem to be abolished. Sprite becoming human made sense due to the actor ageing but the character not so I was perfectly fine with this.Overall the film is almost perfection, just one fatal flaw allowed for the film to slowly lose me.",Eternals

Shang Chi was a hit, Black widow a miss, Eternals unfortunately a miss too.I had my doubts when it started with paragraphs of onscreen text. No film should explain the story with text, the film should do this. Which it did a few minutes later anyway.It's so long for no reason, they could have easily lost an hour without loosing content or story. Some of the acting was great and others poor like the child Eternal. The writing/ directing was just lifeless and just not compelling in anyway.The editing seemed poor as well. I am sitting in a dark cinema and one scene will be so dark I can just about see what's happening. Then it will just cut to an outside shot with the sun glaring in from behind a character. Not just once but constantly throughout the film, just dark then overly bright then dark again.Effects were good but why should they not be in this day and age. Apart from the end credit scene with the dwarf guy, his cgi was some student quality stuff.To sum it up it was just quite dull and some what uneventful for all the potential it had.

Visually, the movie is beautiful, the cinematography is great and the visual effects of the super powers are impressive. However, what it had in visuals, it lacked in plot. The narrative and character development wasn't great, and at some points it felt like it was too divided or it tried to tell too many stories.

378,pythatek,A nice change of pace for MCU.,8,5 November 2021,"First of all - The visuals of this movie is breathtaking. Trippy, epic, magnificent grand, add any adjective it'll fall short. It is unlike any Marvel movie in terms of the scope and grandeur. On an IMAX screen it's truly an amazing experience.This movie misses the mark a lot of things-the pacing and length being the most obvious.But the parts it hits right outweigh the misses. The casting is top notch. At no point it felt like SJW cash-grab, each character had a distinct role. The performance is what holds a lot of the scenes and the jokes from falling flat (yep it goes there), and the chemistry between the cast feels organic - during the dramatic scenes and fight sequences. Marvel always gets the casting right for sure.The background score by Ramin Djawandi is amazing.This movie touches on a lot of topics and some things go really well. The timeline hopping narrative. Historical fiction blending with the Celestial mythos. The fight sequences have good CGI. It's not a PS2 game. The CGI is actually really good.The film feels like it starts a lot of things and takes it nowhere but the path it does tread are done well. Zhao's touch is the most prominent in this journey of these characters.And now as a comics fan watching Jack Kirby's name and to see his work on such grand display is enough to get me satisfied. The work he did is still relevant and creating new trajectories in the MCU, it is a delight to see.

2) characters were amazing, each had their moments to shine, each played off each other well and everyone felt like they knew each other for thousands of years
3)story was fantastic, people are saying it lacks but how.... It gives backs story, it's at a nice pace to not let the film dip at all and it's a great plot with twists and love and comedy?!4)effects were top, like so good from super speed to deviant art was just amazing and fight scenes, yes the beach and amazon were so good!!!!5) still had that marvel comedy to it whilst sticking to an intense battling super hero film!Can't wait for a second and happy they left us with a cliffhanger movie and cliffhanger end credit scene!",Eternals

393,katiesalbrux,"An ""okay"" movie",7,5 November 2021,"If I could, I would give it a 6,5, not a 7, but it wasn't that bad, it was just... Okay.Let me explain.I feel like this movie should have been a series, because - as many people have already said before me - it focuses not on the story, but on the characters. This movie is a character drama, which is nice and interesting - IF you 1. Know and 2. Like the characters. That's not the case here. The movie is reeally long, but at the same time, too short: too long, because there are empty, boring parts, too-long expositions, and short, because we don't have time to get to know these characters. It caused a lot of uncomfortable moments for me, because there were a few emotionally heavy scenes, where I felt basically nothing, thinking ""jeesh, that happened, I should be upset"".The story is quite simple, and honestly, kinda boring. I understand that the MCU wants us to love Earth and People in general, but it's getting increasingly difficult to stomach the ""oh, I must save the planet because I love it"" explanation for everything. It can't be the real motivation behind every single character. There was a nice twist towards the end of the movie, which I didn't expect, so that was at least worth it.The music is forgettable and bland, and the actors? Guys, we have some really BIG names here, but I swear, it looked like they either decided to pretend to not know how to act, or to overdo it to a ridiculous level. It just wasn't believable or authentic at all.Some people say that this is the most beautiful MCU movie - well, in my personal opinion, it's not. It has some nice and inspiring CGI moments, but also some embarrassingly bad ones, too.One last thing: the movie jumps between action sequences (which are OK) and weird, boring parts with my personal (not) favourites: flat jokes, long ""we're standing in a line to pose as superheroes"" expositions, and rom-com-like, (not) romantic moments between actors who don't have any chemistry (or facial expressions!) at all.So. I understand that the director wanted to do something different, and it's different, all right, but it could have been so, so much better.",Eternals
394,raven-11881,One of the greatest MCU-Movies in my opinion,10,6 November 2021,"Actors / Dialogues / Story / LogicBackground of the story and parts of the movie story (Attention: SPOILER!)The Eternals were created millions of years ago by the Celestials to help implement the Celestials' ""plan"" in the universe. Celestials are implanted into the planet's core as a symbiote when new planets are created. The Eternals are then given the task of protecting life on the planets from the Deviants. These were also created by the Celestials, but were a ""failure"". Life on the planets must thrive, and when life reaches its peak, the Celestial awakens and devours the life or the entire planet. But this new Celestial creates again new suns and galaxies and makes the emergence of new life possible again. An eternal cycle, which lets the universe grow and keeps it alive. So far so ""reasonable"", if one looks at it from cosmic view. But since the birth of a Celestial extinguishes also the life of a whole planet, it is equally morally questionable from view of the already existing life to exchange existing life against possible life in the future. The Eternals are always on these planets as a group. Only the leaders know about the annihilation, all others are kept in the dark about it. These think the life of the planet simply needs to be protected from the Deviants. Once the Celestial is born, the Eternals return to the highest and first Celestial. There their memories are reset and the cycle begins again on another planet.The fact that you finally learn more about the universe, the cosmos, and the Celestials and the Eternals here is something I like extremely well. I like this topic ""cosmos"" just totally and find that more interesting than always only the ""little"" people on Earth. Even Thor with Asgard and Norse mythology immediately captivated me back then, as did Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain Marvel.The Eternals in this film arrived on Earth 7,000 years ago to awaken just such a Celestial on Earth as well. But the leader of these Eternals, Ajak (Selma Hayek), has moral qualms and loves humans so much that she wants to prevent the birth of the Celestial. She lets Ikaris (Richard Madden) in on her plan and her remorse. But then Deviants reappear in the present after centuries, and they seem to have become more dangerous and intelligent than ever before. And so Ajak is killed by a Deviant and Eternal Sersi (Gemma Chan) is appointed by the supreme Celestial as her successor. When she learns of the plans about the Celestial and the destruction of Earth, it is terrifying to her in the greatest degree, as she loves humans above all else. And so the Eternals on Earth, who separated centuries ago to live among the humans unrecognized, come together again to discuss what to do. Not everyone agrees, and each Eternal also has problems and concerns all their own.The plot is actually quite logical in itself and I didn't notice any major logic errors. The story takes place in the present, but there are always flashbacks to the time between the arrival on Earth and the present. In this way, the audience gradually learns more and more about the Eternals and their peculiarities, their powers and their problems and worries. I really like that about the film. Not every one of the ten Eternals is given equal screentime. The focus is clearly on Sersi (Gemma Chan) and Ikaris (Richard Madden), but Sprite (Lia McHugh), Thena (Angeline Jolie), Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani), Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), Druig (Barry Keoghan), Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok), Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), and Ajak (Salma Hayek) also get enough attention for the audience to learn enough about all of them and get emotionally involved with them. The characters are the first major strength of the film for me, as they go through an interesting and exciting development. Each of them has their own problems to deal with. Of course, there would have been more if the film had been given an even longer running time. But Chloé Zhao really got the maximum out of the 150 minutes of running time (without credits). Emotionally, however, the film took me away completely.All the characters are well cast and I find that they all play their roles credibly and wonderfully. The interaction between the actors and the Eternals as a team also works wonderfully. Each Eternal has his own idiosyncrasies, but still they harmonize well as a team, even if there are some differences among them.I like the dialogues in the film very much, because they rarely seem forced or inappropriate. The film takes itself seriously (more like Captain Amercia: Winter Soldier or Civil War) and at no point degenerates into a silly comedy like Thor: Ragnarok, Ant-Man, Spider-Man or Guardians of the Galaxy. I read and heard in some reviews that Eternals, like Thor: Ragnarok, often comes across as way too silly and gags were squeezed into the most inappropriate moments and scenes. This is definitely NOT the case. I wonder if we saw the same movie or if some critics were daddling along. Overall, the film is one of the more serious representatives of the MCU. The humor has been interspersed decently and mostly very appropriately. Most of the humor comes from Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and his butler Karun (Harish Patel), and the humor lightens the seriousness a bit, but never as intrusive as in Thor: Ragnarok, for example, where even sad scenes were ruined by inappropriate and silly gags and jokes.A few words about the Eternals' superpowers: to me, the powers and the Eternals themselves reminded me most of the mutants of the X-Universe. Each Eternal has a special power or powers of his own. Ikaris, for example, can fire laser beams from his eyes and fly, while Ajak, for example, can heal himself and others quickly.The Deviants as enemies remain relatively pale, but I like the basic idea that the Deviants have also undergone an evolution and feel betrayed by the Celestials. Unfortunately, not enough is made of this theme, which is why the Deviants never get beyond the usual Marvel enemy image. Unfortunately, some potential was wasted here.One could also question why, for example, Doctor Strange never appears on the scene and helps the Eternals, since he is also as powerful as they are and protects the Earth from cosmic forces. The fact that he doesn't notice anything that happens in the present is very questionable. The same goes for Captain Marvel. It's logical that Thor can't show up, because he flew off with the Guardians of the Galaxy.Setting / CostumesThe settings change between Orient, jungle, European forest, coasts, space, lowlands and cities and are very varied. Also time wise there are scenes between 5.000 BC and today.The costumes are not bad either. Each Eternal has its own style and I really like that.CGI animations / action scenesThe action scenes are relatively rare, but then they really have it going on. The CGI quality is on a high level and the overview in the action scenes is always given. There is no shaky camera and no extremely fast cuts. As a viewer, you always keep a good overview of the action. The final battle is fortunately also exuberantly long and sprawling CGI battle with an overkill of action fireworks, but it is short and crisp. That's the way I like it, because there's nothing more tiring for me than drawn-out action sequences with endless and fast cuts. This is where Eternals absolutely stands out in a positive way.Camera / Scenery / EditingI really liked the camera work. Often the viewer gets to see grandiose wide shots, which also always gives you a good overview of many scenes. There are also many landscape shots from the air and great panoramic images to see. The editing of the film did not strike me negatively, here everything fit well. Long scenes and quiet shots are normal here and I really like that.MusicThe music is rather subtle and the sounds have actually always pleased me quite well, even if here now also only little has stuck. Epochal pieces of music that stick with me as in ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or ""Interstellar"", you look here in vain. But I really liked that the music of the first trailer (""The End of the World"") also appeared in the film, even if unfortunately only once. That immediately gave me goose bumps. Great surprise!ConclusionEternals is in my eyes one of the best movies of the entire MCU so far. It offers an exciting story and finally puts the focus on the Celestials and the Eternals and explains a lot about the cosmic forces of the universe. The focus is clearly on the ten Eternals, their character development over 7,000 years and the dialogues. Almost every character gets enough screentime and room to develop. Eternals is also one of the more serious representatives of the MCU and the humor is discreetly and appropriately interspersed and silly jokes or sayings never come at an inappropriate time (casting evil glances at Thor: Ragnarok). The action scenes are short but crisply staged and the cuts and also the camera shots are really great and provide a good overview of the action. The central theme of the film is a lot of moral issues about ""right"" and ""wrong"" and that it is just not always so easy to draw a clear line between the boundaries.The running time of 157 minutes is not too long either, provided you can get used to the calmer style of the film and the focus on dialogues and character development and don't expect non-stop action. For me, at least, there were no tough stretches and boredom never set in. Eternals totally picked me up emotionally and took me on a great journey for 157 minutes. Even today, a day later, I'm still thinking a lot about the film, and in a positive way. I definitely want to see the movie a second time in the theater!Despite the minor weaknesses, however, I am so incredibly satisfied with the film that I award it the highest score. It's rare that films sweep me away with such extreme intensity.10/10 points - High rewatch value.",Eternals

403,protestant-80830,The Eternals message is shocking,2,6 November 2021,"The message of this Eternals film is actually quite shocking, when you consider the comics backstory, in which the Celestial Arishem became envious and tried to murder the Celestial Tiamut to steal his power. Tiamut fought him off, but before Tiamut could warn the other Celestials of Arishem's treachery, Arishem got to them first with false accusations against Tiamut, and persuaded some of them to attack Tiamut in a gang.After their combined power defeated Tiamut, they ripped out his soul and imprisoned it in ""a vial"", then persuaded the Swarm to devour Tiamut's physical form. Then the Evil Arishem used the power he had stolen from Tiamut to enslave the Celestials who had helped him.Now in this Eternals movie, the Evil Arishem persuades the awakened Eternals to attack Tiamut before his soul can escape and emerge in a new physical form. So millions of viewers are being tricked into cheering on as the Benevolent Celestial Tiamut is murdered and destroyed yet again by the Evil Celestial Arishem, who even kidnaps some of the Eternals who helped him, while Arishem continues to masquerade as a ""Judge"".It is the Depraved Arishem who should be destroyed in the sequel, and Tiamut the Benevolent Dreaming Celestial rescued.",Eternals
404,tomblakey-27156,Eternals is so Fustrating,6,6 November 2021,"Eternals is a painful movie for me. On one hand it's stunning visuals and incredible cast make me love it but the movie has too many problems for me to like it too much. Before it was released, the reviews started coming in from the critics giving it it's now infamous rotten tomatoes score. My statement on this is that I feel really bad for the movie and I still do. It had everything going for it from the cast, the teasing of there return and expansions on them with some cameos at the end (No I'm not talking about the main guy but the other guy who came with him, some sort of lilaputchian I think). But the movie tries to introduce 10 characters at once and only makes me care about maybe 5 at most. Although I thought that the deaths of some characters were sudden and took me off guard. The main problem really is that fact that I don't necessarily like the characters. I felt nothing for people like Ajax or Ikaris even though they were extremely crucial to the plot. These problems really stick out from me enjoying the movies visuals and scale (which is massive and does fit the movie even though some parts are a bit jarring). But the fact that I just don't care about most of the eternals really made me not care for the plot, such as how the world of captain marvel is great but Carol isn't (But better than most of these guys). The only thing I haven't really talked about the action sequences and I have only one thing to say, why Chloe Zhao to direct this. They're ok, just like Nomadland (On the same greatness level, don't think that Nomadland is an action packed thrill ride). This is a heavy superhero fighting movie that really doesn't fit the director, even though she is great and definitely deserves her two academy awards, it just shouldn't have been her movie. In conclusion, I do prefer Nomadland (for me low 7/10) to this but I don't think eternals too bad. But I think that the fact I liked the marvel studios titles (I love Pink Floyd's 'Time') more than almost all the scenes does say something. But I'd say if you're an avid MCU fan I would still go and see it, and stick around for the two post credit scenes for the cameos I mentioned earlier (just ignore the actor cameo in the first not the second(It is just a voice in the second though so don't get you're hopes up to much)). Overall it's a middle tier 6/10. Just a bit worse than Thor.",Eternals

Still, the battle scenes are boring and feel like fillers. I'm sad due the amount of my money and my time wasted of my finite life.",Eternals
415,stephensaaront,I fell asleep halfway through.,6,5 November 2021,"I even drank a Monster right before since I knew it would be slow. I woke up a minute or two later.

416,Mr-Topshotta,"""THE ETERNALS"" REVIEW",8,9 November 2021,"""THE ETERNALS"" REVIEWDirected by Chloe Zhao. Starring a Multitude of high profile actors like Salma Hayek who plays ""Ajak"" the commander/leader of the Eternals who has the power to heal. Gemma Chan who you might know from ""My Crazy Rich Asians"" plays ""Sersi"" a compassionate being with the power to turn anything into other elements like fire, flowers, and water.The Superman template like character but of course obviously better at least that's how they feel in the film. They were some definite DC jabs thrown by Marvel through ""Ikaris"" played by Richard Madden. Who was also ""Sersi"" first life partner. Which connects to the next character ""Dane Whitman"" played by Kit Harington. Which we all know as ""Jon Snow"" from ""Game of Thrones"". I completely forgot and it didn't connect until I saw a press conference. Richard Madden who plays ""Ikaris"" played ""Jon Snow's"" brother in ""Game of Thrones"". So they have a great standing relationship. In this case ""Dane"" is ""Sersi"" human boyfriend. But just because he's human doesn't mean there isn't more that meets the eye with him and his story line.Angelina Jolie plays the famed ""Thena"" with the power to Conjure sword like weapons. She has a slight twist because even though she's a ultimate warrior, she also has a form of Alzheimer's you could say. Her handler and fellow Eternal ""Gilgamesh"" played by Ma Dong-seok. Who has the power of strength enhancements. Lauren Ridloff who plays ""Makkari"" a mute Eternal that has flash like speed. ""Phastos"" played by Brian Tyree Henry aka ""Paper Boy"". All my ""Atlanta"" fans know about him and are extremely happy to see him blossom to this level of stardom ""Phastos"" is super smart and is a ultimate inventory.""Druig"" played by Barry Keoghan with the power to control minds. Kumail Nanjiani who plays ""Kingo"" who can make his fingers turn into a sort of plasma energy gun. His comic relief was spot on especially with the type of heaviness that surrounded them. Lia McHugh who plays ""Sprite"" a Illusionist. She looks like a little girl but is ancient. ""Sprite"" has the burden of being an adult but not being able to live an adult life.Eternals is the beginning of a new saga. This a something brand new being injected into the MCU. You follow this vast cast as it shows how they played a pivotal part in the Earths evolution. You find out who they work for and their true purpose. You follow them as they battle these monsters called ""Deviants"" which are there mortal enemy but fine out it's more Nuance then what you may think. The Eternals are faced with a Dilemma and you see how they work through it all, while fighting an ever evolving ""Deviant"".Their are so many characters and it's so new. But I throughly enjoyed it. The director Chloe Zhao said she called ""Dune's"" Director to get some pointers. Hers is visually stunning like ""Dune"" but way better. Visually and just as a Movie. I've been saying, I'm seeing a lot of visually pleasing movies but the actual movie is lacking in everything else. This was a full round movie. It had to accomplish a lot being a brand new story while giving a good script and action. It showed and told a great story. It was visually beautiful, the cinematography was amazing.With a diverse cast, done on purpose because it embodied the world. With many different Ethnicities being portrayed to ""Phastos"" being gay, having a husband and child. To ""Makkari"" being a mute. It did come off very Justice League ish. But I would say deeper. It didn't help that they mentioned members of the justice league when they took not so subtle jabs at DC. It also gave us a love scene. Which we've never seen done like that before. I could say this was a really good drama movie they just happen to have powers. Curious to see what the future holds and how it ties in to other things. But this felt very different from everything else we've seen before in the MCU. It's definitely in its own lane. It has two post credit scenes. I give it four more fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥

417,Elisej93,It tried doing too much.,6,3 November 2021,"It was alright. 6.5/10 for me. It had some great humor and action scenes. But it was plagued with lots of boring exposition.More importantly, the emotional moments lacked impact for me since I barely knew most of the characters and their motivations. Civil War, Infinity War and Endgame were great because they had standalone movies leading up to them. This movie tried to introduce a plethora of new characters and lore while also having an epic conclusion. It tried doing too much.The best parts of this movie are the more down-to-earth scenes where we can relate to the eternals and the parts where their ideologies conflict. The visuals are also gorgeous, as is to be expected with Marvel. It's pretty to look at, and it will occasionally make you laugh, but most of the substance is forgettable.",Eternals
418,nick-maione,Not sure what movie everyone else saw,10,8 November 2021,"But I was duly impressed with Eternals. We saw it at Imax and I highly recommend a huge screen. The visuals are stunning along with the musics score. It kept me in the film the whole time. I teared up like four times in the film but never a full cry. I love how they bounce back and forth in time to tell the story as if clips of memories when it's important to reference it in the film. I didn't see the twist in the movie at all despite watching some spoilers on YouTube. Well done. The celestials were just intimidating and not cheesy like I was expecting. I'm not one to notice diversity in movies all that much but I have to say I loved loved how much this cast represents the world alongside a story of us all as a people. It really hit home. The fight scenes were pretty good too. Because of the live background scenes, it really felt like you were just there. You get like it really happened. Anyway greatly recommend it and can't wait for a sequel.",Eternals
419,gq0025,Game changing MCU film,9,5 November 2021,"You will hear people say ""Oh Marvel will start to fatigue the more they use the same formula for their films"" While this could have been true Marvel once again reinvented the mold. Changed how their movies look and feel. Eternals is that game changing film. Not only does Chloe Zhao have a signature look for all her films, the movie felt authentic and real. Visual affects were some of the best I've seen in the MCU, the locations were beautiful, the all star cast performed as we would expect from the likes of Angelina Jolie, Bryan Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek and more. The story was on a large scale dealing with humanity, hints to the effects of climate change and making tough global decisions. The film goes between present day and back to the early years when the Eternals arrived to earth 7000 years ago. There is a lot of the same MCU humor and charm in this film which is always the cherry on top when it comes to these films, making light of a situation when lives are at stake. Over all this film was fantastic and most definitely my new favorite MCU film.",Eternals
420,murkee,It was okay....,5,7 November 2021,"Tldr; Rather long - too much filling for the pie.There are reasons some people will hate on this film, that one of the characters kisses his same sex partner is one. Ignore these people. They would not complain if it had been a goodbye kiss of the opposite sex, and these people need to be part of the world. Some people are gay.Some will use coded language to express displeasure at the representation in the casting. Those people can take a long hard look at themselves.It is possible to have issues with a film without it automatically being for these issues.For me, I felt the film had structural issues and would have been better split into two. It was burdened with introducing a huge number of characters, developing them, and in a few cases, killing them off. There was a certain amount of story to cover if the characters could be integrated into the wider MCU, AND the film felt over-full. My solution?Split the film.FIlm 1: The Eternals land. They fight deviants. They seed various bits of human advancement. They defeat the Eternals, Thena gets calmed. Druig storms off with his band. The Eternals separate and have a 'happy ending'.After a pause to let the audience digest.Film 2: We pick up at the modern day, we find that Sersi is no longer with Icarus. The deviants return - and we start to get the twists.Each story gets more time to breath, and we get to know characters before the betrayals and twists. After the first film, and the elapsed time, the impact of the twists is increased.As things stood, there was *so* much story to fit in it felt like ""and another thing""..... so many characters at once, and in a few cases there was little time to 'live with them' before they met an end.",Eternals
421,darkman4801789,Different marvel movie,9,4 November 2021,This movie is a very different movie from the other marvel films. Almost refreshing in a way there are a lot of people criticizing it for lack of screen time for some big actors when the actors they want to see more of aren't the main focus of the film. There are a few twists in there to throw you off! I would definitely see this movie again and I cannot wait for the next eternals movie!,Eternals
422,hambrickh,This Movie is cool and worth the watch!,7,10 November 2021,This movie was a solid Marvel movie . Don't let people tell you it's bad. It's not epic but it's good. Any action movie fan will like this movie. There certisn parts that were confusing and all the obvious inclusion was annoying. Angela Jolie character was a little weak. The powers that they have makes you wonder why they don't do more for mankind. The back story for the characters should be stronger as well. I'm interested in knowing more about there backstop because that would be great.,Eternals
423,Beobachter91,"Blown away, (it's not what people say it is at all)",9,6 November 2021,"I like movies that make me think, keep me guessing, have real stakes and suspense, and great characters. This had all of that. I don't know what the negative reciews are banging on about as a lot of the stuff they say is in there (a long passionate gay kiss? Nope, just a normal kiss like a spouse sending a husband off to war...no tongue, no head movement, no repositioning of the lips, no passion, just a kiss and it's done) and the film did change the formula up, but in really good ways that made me so excited because I couldn't guess what would happen. Definitely lots of jokes and action, too. It's in my Top 5 Marvel for sure. See it and make your own judgement.",Eternals
424,snickzella,"A good movie, just not something i put into my favorites list",7,6 November 2021,"While this is movie is severely flawed, and does get confusing, and might piss you off because of the run time, I won't say this movie is bad. In fact I really liked it. The story and writing isn't great. But what makes this a really enjoyable movie, is the acting, the visual effects, and the fact it dives deeper into long Marvel comic book lore. What's even more surprising I feel about this movie are the actors. I'd figure people like Angelina Jolie or Selma Hayek would play the characters to get the main focus, but I like how this movie gives them more a supporting role. Which I think is a good move, since as great as Selma and Angelina are as leading ladies, they still manage to still be great as supporting characters. What I really liked (also) is nothing in this movie felt phoned in or like the actors where sleep walking through a performance. Some might call the performances ""dull"" or ""boring"" or just flat out ""awful"", however i don't see that, i see exactally what i was expecting from a movie, about cosmic aliens, who obviously don't have the same emotional range like everyone else. But when any of the actors have to just act with their body language or facial expersions, it feels really honest and powerful. Everyone is honest and gives plenty of subtle passion and reserved energy, which is the sign of a good actor. But as I stated, the writing in this film isn't great. A lot of it involves non-leaner story elements having to do with big revelation (the kind you see in game of thrones). Basically its broken into two different movies, one that's backstory, and the other has to do with the main story. But I understand why Marvel did this. As it sets up the eventual introduction of the X-Men and mutants into the MCU, since the Eternals are a major part to the back story of the mutants origins. All in all this movie is good. And I believe all the problems in this movie will be redeemed in a potential sequel, because clearly this movie establishes plenty of great potential.",Eternals
425,stingray-37490,All visuals no content,3,5 November 2021,"That's all visuals no content.No plot, no jokes, irrelevant acting. But you for sure can create a lot of cool posters from this movies screen grabs.What a waste of a great cast.",Eternals
426,gwmadrigal,You can probably arrive a mid movie and still not miss it,7,7 November 2021,"I guess I'm going to divide this movie in two parts. The first part that consists of a very long introduction to characters that nobody knows them. Who are the eternals? What's the role in earth... Etc. Not your typical vigilante hero. That part was super long and extremely detailed oriented. Some people may like all details. Personally I don't. I think it was overdone.Then the second part where the action movie really begins. That part was great, with some unexpected plot twists about the villains. Special effects and fight scenes are awesome. Kudos to visuals, sound effects, acting. All of that was great.Strengths: special effects, action fight scenes. Purpose
Weakness; very very long character development. Too many characters, so not enough screen time for all characters.",Eternals
427,kittkt,WW84 was better !,4,9 November 2021,"I had seen several negative reviews before I watched this, but I still gave it a chance.Several people in my screening walked out part way through.The special effects and CGI were OK, but the story is mostly incoherent, with too many flashbacks and jumps forward in time.It doesn't really develop the characters, so you can't really care too much for most of them unlike The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy.",Eternals
428,jonesalec-94647,A celestial scale movie that lands relatively well,8,4 November 2021,"Eternals isnt a perfect movie, no MCU title is, but it doesn't deserve such a low score.The challenge of the film to introduce and flesh out so many characters is handled as well as it can be, each Eternal is developed enough and they all have well defined powers that play their role.The visuals are some of the best in the MCU, with the Deviants and the Celestials being particularly well designed, dominating the screen when visible.The soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi is at least 70% fire, with an amazing ethereal vibe that makes for great accompaniment to whats on screen.Again, not a perfect movie, but a very entertaining Phase 4 adventure with a great cast that sets up an exciting new side of the MCU, as well as some other exciting directions for one character in particular (stick around for both post credit scenes)",Eternals
429,abdullahsohail-24121,Watch it and decide for yourself!,10,7 November 2021,"I actively recommend people to ignore critic reviews because they are likely doing it for a profit which means that their opinion will most likely be biased, same goes for audience reviews in a way that their reviews are biased because of their personal preferences and taste. (not mentioning the very obvious LGBTQ+ hate spread)There is a lot to juggle in this movie but for the most part, everything was handled brilliantly and was not as polluted as many say it is but that could also simply come down to how much you know about the MCU. The movie is eternity above others in the MCU compared to how emotional it is, it has many deep, spiritual ideas and views about it which require people to be open-minded. The humor is also amazing but doesn't elude the common problem of Marvel movies of misplacing humor and jokes or packing it in where it's not needed. Finally the action and cinematography is astounding and breath-taking, the visuals of this movie cannot be compared to any other Marvel one because they are simply on another level, whether it is a awe-inspiring sunset shot or an exhilarating action sequence, everything was done beautifully. The powers of everyone were shown on screen in full-scale and every single Eternal had their own moment to shine.So watch and decide for yourself how much you like this movie! It's not bad by any means and I would say it's absolutely amazing but that could also be because I went into the movie with substantial MCU knowledge which is way above average compared to the casual watcher who are also the ones who seem to be bombarding the movie with horrible reviews. My comprehension of the ideas of the MCU could also be why I was so amazed by every little thing that happened in the movie which of course had led me to writing this 10* review.",Eternals
430,emilrosvik,First MCU movie i did not like,5,7 November 2021,"Didn't expect it to be good before I went to see it, wanted to see it because it could bring ua a hint about the future. It wasn't good but not bad either. Just hints that there may be a second movie and whould defenetly not see this again or the next one.",Eternals
431,mephisto2424,"Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest.",7,5 November 2021,"Chloe Zhao is an amazing director but she wasn't the right fit for this movie. Since this movie was first announced, it'd piqued my interest.Clearly this film is taking a different approach than what we normally see in a MCU film.It seems out of place almost because of how different this story is delivered. The story was also a bit messy I thought, with the time jumps going back and forward making it confusing to tie loose ends. And it was also a weak story might I add, because I felt that there wasn't much excitement happening in the film, especially during the second act. There wasn't much development with many of the eternals, as it's too hard for a 2 hour 30min film to develop 10+ characters deep enough for audiences to feel some sort of emotion towards them.Yeah, there are scenes that just must be seen on the big screen, and the fact that it was shot in real locations says enough about the size of the film. The big cosmic scenes will make you feel small. It's shot with a massive scope, looking visually different and intimate. Chloé Zhao has a really unique visual stamp. The cinematography is georgeous!Personal favourites are Thena and Gilgamesh.I still recommend people to watch it, but don't go in with high expectations.",Eternals
432,rvgillam-44732,Left a lot to be desired...,1,8 November 2021,Just wasn't a fun or memorable experience overall.Characters lacked depth and it gave you a sense of apathy for most of the film.The most likeable character was Kingo's valet.,Eternals

Right now it is the lowest rated MCU movie on Rotten Tomatoes and is under a 7 on IMDb. It should be at least a 7 and is bu FAR not the worst MCU movie, probably around top 8-12 for me.Watch this and make your own opinions but please rate it higher than you think to balance out the people hating it for the wrong reasons.",Eternals

438,NellaMarieDudova,"Hey movie critics, are you okay?",8,5 November 2021,"I can't be the only one who's noticed that this movie bombed with the critics. My question is, how? I genuinely hope it's not only because a woman directed and wrote it. I also hope it's not just because it has a beautifully diverse cast spanning from POC to people with disabilities. As a huge MCU fan who can sometimes get caught up in the obsession myself, I knew to come into watching this movie without too many expectations on the plot aspect. However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is as good as any other MCU film and even better than some. I implore you to watch the movie with an open mind, not just as a superhero movie but as something more. As something new. If you see the film through the eyes of someone seeking modern-day thematic elements, then this is the movie for you. If you want to know why the Eternals didn't help fight Thanos... welp, that's in the trailer. This movie made me laugh, made me cry and made me think about its meaning. Isn't that precisely what a movie is supposed to do? All be it, the first post-credit scene made me cringe. I think that was its purpose-a minor WOW factor. The second post-credit scene, however, made it all worth it. I can't wait to see what the Eternals have in store for us in the new phase.",Eternals
439,jenniffertafoya,Amazing movie😍😍,10,6 November 2021,I really loved this movie and it has been my favorite.

But definitely reminds me of Wonder Woman.,Eternals
440,functioningfine,Easy to tell that these 1 star reviews are fake,8,10 November 2021,"This was a good movie. Finally something different. I liked all the characters. I don't need a back story for each character. That would make the movie 18 hours long. Externals were put on Earth to grow the population, by protecting them, but not from each other so they can evolve and populate, for a bigger purpose. That's all I need to know. All these 1 star reviews are from people who should have stayed home and colored in their coloring books.",Eternals

Did the character differences (Referring to making one of the eternals a Gay character) have to be in the film... NO. Did it take anything away from it or make the movie bad... Absolutely NOT!!! It was still a great story. Pretty jammed pack with stuff introducing so many new faces and explaining the origin stories.

443,luisbranco18,"THE PROBLEM IS THE SCRIPT, NOT THAT THE MOVIE FEELS DIFFERENT FROM MCU",10,7 November 2021,"Keep hearing and reading that it is a very complicated and confusing story that's why it didn't work.No.It's the opposite. The movie is quite simple. At it's core, it's about preventing a galactical being from destroying the earth (Emergence). The solution is simple: turn him to ice (first, to make him sleep). The problem: moral dilemma.Somehow, they manage to stretch this into a 2.5 hours movie and that's the issue. I didn't time it, but we only even hear about the Emergence probably like an hour in? And that's not even hard to find out, Sersi just talks to a giant being to explains to her.So the rest of the movie is just worldbuilding, exposition and backstory, that's why it may have a stale feel.I actually like it, the visuals are amazing and when the plot develops it's not bad, considering that it is hard to tackle huge beings problems, but it has too much of not essential stuff.",Eternals
444,ablonczybrigi,A New Marvel Era,8,6 November 2021,Watched it yesterday and not dissapointed at all. It was a great start for a new era in MCU and I am so excited to see more of it. Eternals is different that is sure but has many potential to make another great franchise. Dane Whitman is the next main storyline that we need to see. With his 10 minutes of screentime Kit Harington stole the movie. I loved the twist in the film. There were boring parts but nowadays all movies have it weaknesses. After all Eternals worth to watch and it will be an amazing new journey.,Eternals

But Eternals, I will never watch again. The story was slow, frustrating and disappointing. I don't think it was cast correctly as it was like hammed up acting and the interactions between some cast were like read of a script. The thought process of taking out a Celestial by an Eternal just defied logic and to me unbalanced the characters within the Marvel Universe. Certainly great effects, but long periods of irrelevant actions and some dumb jokes. For example breaking a table, thinking it was vibranium... duh, how smart are these people meant to be. Anyway its worth a watch, but leave your brain at home.",Eternals

They each seem to lack any real personality and so feel almost like androids.A sex scene in a Marvel movie? A big no. This is about superheroes.This would have been better with just three or four plot characters with individual personalities that could develop over the course of the film.I couldn't finish it, it was boring.",Eternals

448,ehubb15,"A disappointment, but still overall good",7,6 November 2021,"I don't think this is the worst MCU movie like rotten tomatoes would suggest. But I do see why it doesn't work for a lot of ppl. When reading about Kevin Feige saying this is the best movie they've ever made. I feel like he was referring to the individual elements of the film but obviously couldn't take it back once seeing the full product.PROS:
The characters are great and everyone get's at least their own little moment. The standouts to me were Druig and Kingo. Kingo brought the comedic energy the movie needed while Druig got the most substance behind his characterization.This is the BEST looking MCU movie. The cgi and cinematography were absolutely amazing. I really love how all of the eternals powers were portrayed, especially Makkari. To me this was the best display of super speed I've seen in any movie. Being rivaled only by the flash in ZS Justice League. With all the money marvel makes, they should definitely invest in shooting on location a lot more. It really does make a difference.The ideas, questions, and themes the movie brings up are all great. I feel like these were the ingredients that could have made this movie a masterpiece if they had executed it better.CONS:
The biggest thing that holds this movie back from truly being something special is the fact that it doesn't fully commit to any of the great ideas and questions it brings up. I feel like Chloe Zhao wanted to make deep thought provoking drama, but was constrained by the fact that it still had to be a comic book marvel movie. For example without going into spoilers, the deviants hate the eternals b/c they feel like the eternals are the real monsters. When I was watching it I was like, ""YES, let's explore that"". Then they don't. They bring up that really interesting perspective from the villain, but don't explore any of it. That's just one example. Everything from the celestials, deviants, questions about humanity, and some of the eternals characterizations were all really REALLY great ideas. But they never took the time to actually explore anything beyond just the surface of these great idea. I feel like that's what so frustrating about this movie and why it just didn't connect with a lot of ppl. You can't just bring up questions about is humanity worth saving and never actually dive into that. It just leaves you with an anti climactic feeling.The deviants were a complete waste. This ties back to my previous con about the movie. They bring up a great dynamic between the eternals and deviants that I feel like could have been something very riveting. But that's all they do. They just bring it up, without exploring any of it. So that by the end of the movie, the deviants storyline just fall flat.CONCLUSION:

450,a-abdelrahim,Marvel: Let's try to see how sucking feels like,4,7 November 2021,"So marvel hated success and decided to try how sucking feels!!Two hours and half that can be told in 15 minutes, no deep characters personalities in most of the characters.At least give them powers like the avengers, imagine one of the heroes creates illusions and and the other manipulates everyone minds except the enemies they are fighting, and the third has fast healing only!! So why anyone will send those to save anybody?!The most powerful three of the eternals are as follows: a mentally disturbed lady, the actual villain, and wait for it, no, they killed third in the middle of the movieI was literally feeling like i am watching a low budget sci fi movie, it's not a marvel movie, no chills no funny parts, no surprise.",Eternals

Angelina Jolie and Don Lee were also a highlight.However, the writing held this project back. There is an especially egregious moment about halfway through where the plot comes grinding to a halt and the bad guy monologues for a good 10 minutes. This is frustrating, because all the information is later shown in more organic ways.

This could be absolutely the same movie without her. Also why would Celestials build Eternals with flaws?Icarus had to try to kill them all before he turns good guy in a second, after which he blows himself in the sun?? So he abandoned his life mission, the way they were programmed by Celestials in a blink of an eye? Like ""Im not gonna let you do that, I will kill you all."" Next second. ""OK, do it!""???So. Much.

I've read the all the Eternals books enough to know how much of a task it was to pull this off onscreen and the director did a really really good job.If you've not seen it yet and don't know the backstory I suggest you just simply enjoy the story presented because it finally opens up the cosmic universe.I hope the future of the MCU gets even more stupendous because I definitely want to be taken there when I watch these films.I didn't expect to like many of the characters onscreen but they all worked for me as a fan of the books.",Eternals

You saw a lot of unnecessary side scenes but very few important ones.The dialogues were not so epic, and not so memorialized, only a few of them that I remember, unlike other mcu movies...Even so many flash backs didn't help to construct my interest about the feelings of the Eternals for the humans also their own character. Too many new characters to explore but we didn't have the time for all of them.

462,hottiebootyboii,FROM A NON-MARVEL FAN,8,5 November 2021,"I've never been invested in the MCU, so this is coming from someone who isn't comparing it to every other Marvel movie.The scenes and sets from ancient civilizations were unbelievable. Truly I could have watched entire movies just exploring them. To be honest they were so good that it felt kind of jarring to watch the Eternals in their superhero getup walking around them, like if you added aliens to the Harry Potter-verse or something. It just kind of clashed.The Celestials and space scenes were incredible too, and the golden geometric aesthetics of their powers were sooo pretty, much more visually pleasing than the usual metal and fire explosions you normally see with superheroes.The plot was definitely slow, but the one by one introductions to each of the characters modern day lives was interesting and made up for the lack of plot development. However once everyone was introduced i feel like the plot started to go downhill to the point where i was kind of bored through the final fight sequence.It's apparent to me at least that Marvel put a lot more effort into filming locations, special effects and getting big name actors than they put into the plot line and story telling, which is unfortunate as the concept in general could expand indefinitely for future movies so hopefully marvel fans can look past that before they write this movie off as a flop.Gemma Chan was not a good choice for the lead role. Her acting and vibes were bland to the point where the character was boring and forgettable even though she was supposed to be the center of the movie, She didn't have the presence the movie needed for a main character, and the story fell flat because of it.I really liked Kumail Nanjiani's performance as Kingo, he def added life to what otherwise would probably have been a bland group dynamic. Druig's character was interesting, but I felt he could have had a more complex role and I'm hoping he has more going for him in the next movie. I absolutely LOVED how the Eternals communicated with Makkari in sign language, I thought that was a great affition to the movie and dynamics between the characters.",Eternals

464,Soaring_Eagle_USA,A disjointed mess,1,7 November 2021,"This movie has no plot and what little story is there is disjointed. What is up with the flying chocolate bar and why didn't the sun melt it? Why were the villages being attacked? Why are the ""villains"" so generic?I wasn't invested in most of the characters. The costumes were very lame. I've seen better Cosplay at comic conventions. The one character that was interesting to me wasn't developed (Sprite). The casting was bad and made little sense. Why would a race of eternal beings include one that is deaf? 7000 years of life experience and no super power to compensate for that? Why is an Indian character played by a Pakistani? Is that the reason the Bollywood stuff was so cringy? Why is a Scott playing a Greek? Why is a Korean playing a Sumerian? The casting was all over the place.The directing is also a mess. Chloe Zhao is a decent enough director but her style is not at all appropriate to a superhero movie.There were all most no people in the theater I went to and I was so bored with the movie that I was nodding off during the parts that were quiet.If you like the bits that are visual eye candy and prefer a movie that is far too long and has no plot or story this movie is for you.",Eternals

Only shortcoming is this movie tackles too much of a story in one swoop and it felt a little bit out of blue ( the cosmic side of mcu ).

467,TRIDENT1745,"A breathtaking, immersive film... with a catch",8,6 November 2021,"I am an avid MCU fan, and I went into this movie expecting a full blown sensual overload, and that is what I recieved, although to a slightly lower extent.We have to note the very essence of Chloe Zhao's direction. She is not your average action director. Zhao's perpetration in filmmaking is a journey through a medium of human empathy and emotion. Whilst this movie does not strive to be the next ""Endgame"", Zhao's employment of extended character responses, and thus the lack of any meaningful action act to challenge the essence of humanity within us.Yet at the same time, this challenges the foundations of the MCU.The positives... The visuals are INCREDIBLE. The continuous entanglement and subsequent evolvement of golden lines and formations are majestic visual features that have burned into my memory. The cast smashed it (what did you expect?) and Richard Madden & Gemma Chan outperformed their expectations.Also, the score was excellent, and seeing as Ramin Djawadi scored this film, I would have expected nothing less.However, the flip side in Zhao's direction is the very thing it aims to achieve. From a blanket point perspective, there are simply too many characters and too many threads of development. Therefore, the whole film can be very confusing if you lack the pre-reading.Furthermore, the film was 2hr 40min long. At times, it felt like a maddened rush to force the audience to accept every Eternal, despite many people not even knowing their names at the end.The ending was a tad underwhelming and I feel that with the emotive characterization Zhao employed, I feel that Ikaris should have carried his rage further before flying into exile, despite the comics.That being said, Eternals is a solid film, and with the excessive character introduction established, I am thoroughly looking forward to part two!",Eternals

It gives its characters deep, lived in backstories full of individuality and personality and I absolutely loved it.

A lot of unnecessary screen time dragging out parts of the movie, with very little on-screen connection to anything currently going on in the MCU, other than verbal reference.Best part of the movie was the last half hour, and post-movie/credits scenes.This isn't one of those marvel movies I'll watch again and again.

I liked the family themes likes conflict, self doubt, leading without forcing someone to do something, mental health/abuse.

This movie has no story and is filled with the most basic and bland characters in the history of film. This is three hours of the same stock CGI effects we've seen a million times with awkward and unfunny comedic breaks that are just stale as the characters who constantly go into redundant philosophical monologues that make no sense. It's the same tired marvel formula that puts nothing at stake and is devoid of any conflict.

478,jpds-29038,"With impressive photography and a tone of hope, Eternals surprises and thrills, but it could have shown us even more the strength of these superheroes so powerful.",8,4 November 2021,"Eternals is a movie full of love that starts out interesting from the beginning, but that's about it. ""Interesting"" is the keyword for the feature, which takes a long time to get emotional (unlike other Marvel Studios films), but impresses audiences in a calmer way by presenting the vast power of each of the group's members. Super heroes with a wonderful CGI that gives beauty to the film. But don't get confused, it would be unfair to say that Eternals is bad for its slower tone, something different from other films in the franchise. The story is intriguing, enigmatic and holds the viewer to the screen, but the fights full of mystical powers and magic take time to get relevance to the plot and, when they do, they don't show all the giant power that the group of Eternals possess. Regardless of how calm the film is, it's impossible to say that it's serious and dark like the DC Extender Universe features, as some critics have pointed out, as it has a few puns and a certain comedic tone, even if it sometimes comes out of the blue. Eternals is a beautiful film and it deals very well with the issue of diversity, especially with Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry), an openly gay character, and Makkari (Lauren Ridloff), who is hearing impaired and wonderfully well produced, but can seem calm. Too much for Marvel Studios. Chloé Zhao did a beautiful job, something totally different from anything seen on the MCU, regardless of whether it's good or bad...",Eternals

480,reidmiriam,"Not the mcu's best, but far from its worst.",8,4 November 2021,"Eternals is not the best MCU movie, not even close. But the general consensus for reviews on many aggregate websites are painfully misrepresent how good this film is. The special effects are exceptional, and Zhao's decision to film on-location gives the film a layer of authenticity that isn't found in a lot of Marvel films. The acting is very good, particularly Kumail Nanjiani, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden. The cast has great chemistry, and is much more diverse than what is typical even now in the film industry, which I don't doubt is a factor in the film's surprisingly low ratings. The depiction a deaf character is well handled, as is Marvel's first on-screen queer relationship.That's not to say that there aren't significant issues with Eternals. Its very long, the second-longest Marvel film, behind Endgame, and the pacing does drag in places.Additionally, Eternals deals with a lot of comic book lore which can't really be left out of the film considering that most people watching this film won't have read the comic books. Eternals tends to dump a lot of lore in conversations which often feel rather forced, and for me, the way that the exposition was handles was by far my least favourite part about Eternals.Eternals is still worth a watch. It feels a lot less like any MCU film i've seen, which is interesting in itself, even if it's not what you look for in your entertainment. I might even say that at times it feels more like a DC film than anything Marvel has produced before.If you are, as I was, quite aware of the ways that Eternals falls short as a piece of cinema, it's still entertaining, visually stunning, and at times very moving, and it sets up some interesting concepts for the future of the MCU. Frankly, the fact that it's currently lower-rated than both the incredible hulk and Thor: The Dark World is ridiculous. It's orders of magnitude better than both those films, so don't let the mediocre rating dissuade you from giving Eternals a shot.Even if it's not the best film i've ever seen, it's still solid entertainment.",Eternals

486,isaacmward-85348,"Visually Stunning, yes. Good....not necessarily",5,7 November 2021,"Eternals (2021) is directed by Chloe Zhao and it stars Gemma Chen as Sersi, Richard Madden as Icarus, Angeline Jolie as Thena and Salma Hayek as Ajak among many other actors to create this stacked cast. Does this entry to the MCU deserve eternal praise? Let's find out.The PlotThe plot has many distinct differences from other MCU films. It involves questions of morality and the extent to which we will preserve life. As a result, the line between a hero and villain dynamically changes throughout the runtime. Certain events desire multiple perspectives from different points in time. Furthermore, this movie has the most title cards in any MCU movie. This turned me off from the film because I constantly got confused at different points in the plot due to a lack of order. Ultimately, the plot is convoluted and leaves much for us to desire. However, the characters are really intriguing in this film. Let's talk about the characters.The CharactersI thought that the Eternals team has some of the most interesting characters yet. However their powers aren't necessarily unique. For example, as shown by the 2nd trailer, Icarus has the powers of Superman due to his ability to shoot lasers out of his eyes. Another character has similar powers as Loki. Although a couple of characters don't have unique powers there are some exceptions. Sersi played by Gamma Chen is able to manipulate matter and this leads to some beautiful visuals in the film. Also, the relationships between all the characters are really fleshed out and I deeply cared about what might happen to them. Specifically the character dynamics between Thena and Gilgamesh and the interaction between Icarus and Sersi. Ajak serves an important role in the film. She effectively grounds the team and introduces us to the world. She also becomes a strong motivation for our characters. Although the Eternals aren't human they certainly have some qualities of humanity. As a result, the search for humanity is a highlight of the film. Now let's talk about the cinematography.The CinematographyThe Director of cinematography for this film, Ben Davis, effectively uses diverse long shots. Specifically, beautiful long shots of space, the desert, and their ship. I believe that this is the best cinematography to touch the MCU yet. It also captures the grandiose nature of this ambitious film. So if you love diverse shots and compositions, then you may really enjoy this film. Now let's talk about the villains.VillainsAs shown by the trailers, the Eternals battle the deviants which are apex predators that feed on people. However, since they are brainless predators, they don't have much character. Not only do they not have character, but the CGI diminishes their realism. As a result, they really are just a punching bag for our heroes. These monsters are actually a background for the real villain of this film. I felt like the villains plan was bland. The complexity of the world disconnected me from the central conflict between our heroes and the deviants. As a result, I was really just waiting till the end credit scene.ConclusionSo although the characters are unique, the villains are bland and need more development. If you really enjoy visual spectacle and world building, I'll recommend this film to you. However, if don't want to wait through the first two acts to get to some action, then this film is not for you. I personally enjoyed the visual spectacle and characters, but the story and villains weren't for me. I'm going to the give Marvel's Eternals a 5/10.",Eternals

For an origin story it was one of the best. We can't expect origin stories to be extraordinary all the time.

495,stativechicken,"Great characters, weak story",4,7 November 2021,"Eternals was the latest film in the mcu, it has come good qualities, like everyone of the characters, they all get a chance to shine, they all have their own strengths, personalities, flaws, and inner vulnerability's, each of them added to the story and there wasn't a single one of them I didn't think were poorly written, it also have some impressive shots and cgi, and it is more than you're standard marvel movie, all that said, I found the story to be a bit weak, they tell us one thing about their mission and show us the opposite, also the plot changed throughout its second act, which was ok, I just wish we could have known sooner. And I found the main plot a bit stupid, and I feel like the film would have been better without the deviant's, and I found myself board throughout certain points in the movie, and I dealt like the flashbacks were far to long, if a sequel dose get made by the same director and maybe some different writers, as the director seems to know what she's doing in terms of the characters, but not the plot, and it did get me exited to see them again, all in all this brings out the worst and best of movies, I hope I didn't upset anyone with this review, and have a good day.",Eternals
496,wilf-96331,Sure it's different but that's ok,8,6 November 2021,"Some of the reviews here are just not fair at all... ""not enough humour"", ""too diverse"", ""too long""...so I'm gonna be genuine and fair hereThe plot of this film was one of the most interesting we've seen from the MCU. Two and a half hours isn't long for a movie. If you think it is then why did you go and watch it? One of the big controversies in Eternals was the diverse cast. I honestly thought when I saw the initial reviews it was gonna be really in your face but it wasn't. None of the cultures were main plot points of the film. Sure Kingo was a bollywood actor but that was only really the setup for a few pretty funny jokes. At no point did this film try to focus on the cultures of the actors as like an empowerment thing. It was normalised, not forced. The actors did a great job and their chemistry was fairly good.Eternals, I'd say, is the first MCU movie that pushes the boundaries a bit. The jurassic park-like violence, a few weak but still present jump scares and the less humouress, more serious tone - all factors not really present in the MCU until now. I would say it's like the DCEU but it's well better than those films. The constant only moderately funny jokes in marvel films get old after a while and I'm glad this one toned it down a bit in that department. And the jokes, when they were there, weren't actually too bad.The big thing this movie has really got going for it is the cinematography. Very well shot movie, however every reviewer has touched on this so I won't delve into it.I said I was going to be fair so here it is. I think Kro was a little underused. He's a pretty cool character and I would've liked to see more of him but there's always a chance he could come back. I mean it is marvel we're talking about. Same with a few of the Eternals but the feelings not as strong for me. I mean there's always gonna be more marvel movies right?Last but not least the post credit scenes were really good and set up some very epic story lines that I would love to see in a sequel or spin-off.",Eternals
497,zgriffith-33852,"Pretty, but disappointing.",4,5 November 2021,"This movie wasn't good, and that's not terribly surprising. The movie struggles with being part of a much larger universe, at times feeling like it should be just a stand alone, but with jarring references to the universe that feel out of place, forced, and often make little sense to that universe. There's no real, central villain, which makes it feel like several little movies that got mashed together. The visuals are as impressive as always, but the fights are boring, the plot is muddled, and by the last 30 minutes I just felt like it should have been over already. None of the characters are particularly interesting either, which is disappointing given the diversity of the powers, personalities, and even actors.I did think the internal reflection of one of the eternals at seeing the consequences of his own meddling in human affairs was really interesting, and provided at least some explanation for the Eternals choice to remain adherent to their non-intervention rule, but it is brief, left unexplored, and frankly feels like it was an after thought.The comedy doesn't land well either.Frankly, this is surprising given director Chloé Zhao's otherwise phenomenal quality of work.

Get over yourselves. Go pick up some Jack Kirby books.The Eternals (both in comic and movie) is a tale of the many differences in life and choices we make.This movie is about life, family, and a sense of purpose- with the very real struggles of everyday man represented via deus ex machina.I went to see this with my father, and he's a very smart man; Well educated, but he's of a generation that goes to the movies to be entertained and not to be provoking any thought. His favorite marvel movie is Iron Man.Was that a good movie? Yes. Do we need 1000 Iron Man cookie cutter movies? Heck No!We have been spoiled by the MCU providing the best in super hero cinema and visual effects.This movie is no different than that except... the pacing is a little slower to flesh out a larger cast of characters (of whom we've never seen before) and so that we really feel for these ETERNALS.If anything, I'd say the pace of this movie is about the same as Saving Private Ryan.Everyone played their part very well.Chloe Zhao could not have done better. This was truly a magnificent look at humanity. (I can't wait for the longer cut to come out. I'm sure this could've been a 4 hour movie and I would've loved it just the same!)For all the haters:

Well, then probably the story will fell for you in the 50% of the movie time.Characters: i rarely remember every heroes name, but this time i do, everyone has face in this picture, they are no good or bad heroes, but the grey ones. They are tons of humour, and conflicts.Camera works: long-expositions as if you watching Chloé's or Terrence Malick's recent works, you will see a lot of similarities.Effects / Fights: they are great, not perfect, but very fast paced, and brutal, even though i really wanted more.Overal this movie is very uniqute, it has elements of indie movies combined with marvel's standart formula, with great characters, a very interesting questions, but long-expositions, and huge amount of small details can be a burden to fully enjoy the story.",Eternals

510,poseidonjustin,Too Many Characters and Director Mismatch,2,4 November 2021,"Chloe Zhao is talented and should get more projects in the future, maybe even another Marvel movie. But Eternals was a bad mismatch with Chloe's directing style, worsened further by having to introduce 10 characters.The movie is simultaneously too long and too short. If they wanted to properly tell the story with all 10 characters it needed to be a mini-series, not a movie. Alternatively to adapt it as a movie they should have focused on introducing a handful of characters and in a sequel they could have introduced the rest.As is the movie never stops introducing new characters or new exposition. It's sadly the worst MCU movie I've seen and the first I've wanted to walk out on due to boredom.",Eternals

They included elements related to a various cultures and nations to lure people into the cinemas, and it didn't work at all for the movie. The story is so incoherent that it just keep on switching from one direction to another.Especially scenes of Kumail Nanjiani are so laughable, I felt like I am watching a B grade inane comedy movie rather than a superhero movie. Sometimes these scenes were so cringeworthy and stupid, I just wanted to leave the theatre in the middle.Overall, I would rate this movie between 4-5 only because I like the spectacular sceneries and CGI in the film, the way Ikaris shoots pure laser beam from his eyes, and of course because of Angelina Jolie.",Eternals

They really focused on the characters background but it kept just short flashes of different time zones. I feel they tried to cram to much in that you miss out on a lot of the action. The short clips aren't really enough to satisfy you nor enough to time with each character to connect.Angelina Jolie is one of the biggest actors in the world. If they wanted to use her, they should of used her and not made her an extra. I'm sure she will be more relevant in future films but this did not help this film. I can't completely explain, it's not terrible but it does not live up to other Marvel films.The film was far too long, not enough action and not engaging enough. The characters don't mesh well together. But maybe that's where they where trying to be different. 2 or 3 maybe grew on me by the end but not enough to be excited by a 2nd film.",Eternals

519,marc-555-826885,Eternals: Big Picture Thinking,8,6 November 2021,"First thing first; this is NOT the worst MCU movie, not even close. There is a LOT to love about this movie; it looks amazing, balances a lot of characters well and is certainly the most epic film in terms of scale. It is not your typical MCU film but that's no bad thing. There a lot of weighty dialogue and some topics are quite earnest and philosophical, but I prefer that over the vacuous content of many other films. And, as origin stories go, at least this one tried to do something a little different, merging material from the comics, with some original ideas and content.There are flaws however. The action sequences aren't always as impactful as they could be and some of visual effects feel a little rushed. The scope of the story won't appeal to everyone and the ending may leave a lot of viewers scratching their heads.People have been drawing comparisons with Dune, saying that DV's film shows how to make sweeping large-scale with complex characters and gravitas. Dune is a technically superior film to the Eternals, but here's the thing; I appreciated the craft and diligence of Dune, but I enjoyed Eternals more. Dune is intellectual but quite cold, whereas Eternals has a lot more heart.",Eternals
520,max-munro,Marvels sameness held up by emotional performances and expert direction,7,3 November 2021,"Easily the best part about Eternals is, like all other Marvel properties, what makes it different from the rest. In this case it is the visual landscape of the film, across the variety of locations DP Ben Davis and director Chloé Zhao capture a naturalness of the environments they shoot allowing the characters to feel alive in these settings rather than floating in a space of nothingness. The lighting team impressively made a Marvel film one of the most beautifully lit films of the year.The next major highlight was the performances by the whole cast, everyone legitimately killed it.The glaring flaw was obviously the training wheels feeling that is implemented by Marvel itself, having to fit inside the box is the thing that is keeping niche concepts like an eternal race of gods and the stories that can evolve from that, well...evolving.",Eternals
521,strangelilvampyr,Long & Dry,5,8 November 2021,"I have no comic book background to understand the story for this next phase for Marvel, which is probably why I was confused, and ready for the movie to be over and standup again. I enjoyed the diversity of the cast and their performances, their humor and how they played off each other, but I found the content of the movie itself dry. Long and dry, ready for it to be over. I also started getting sleepy so I know my investment in it was done. Maybe it could have been better had there been some kind of inter-multi-movie build up that has connections to characters we're familiar with and we're looking forward to saving the planet and humanity - again. This is like what? The third time? Wait no. Fourth?I found many things confusing. With Thanos we had so many movies building up to his appearance and defeat so that the final battle made sense. As someone coming to this super fresh - how, for example, does not intervening with Thanos before he fought the Avengers make it a human problem they're not allow to handle? Didn't Thanos threaten all those lofty world-building plans long before he met a human? Makes no sense. And Kit Harrington's backstory. Super confused. And for crying out loud - how did One Direction get in there?! I just sat there asking ""what is happening?!""
Last time I was this confused was Infinity Wars and the guy behind me who screamed with the introduction of Captain Marvel's logo. At least then I had someone to ask who/why.",Eternals

All those low ratings because it is slow paced, only shows that people who like superhero movies have forgotten how it is at the beginning after watching known characters for so long. They were expeting another Avengers movie. The slower rythm is necessary to let us know the characters/heroes that we are meeting for the first time.Zhao's style is much different than the Russo's brothers, it is somber but still beautiful. The characters are great, it has some humor, like any other Marvel movie.But, I strongly believe that the Eternals movie should have been divided into 2. The first one to introduce the characters and their internal struggles through out time, making us relate more to them and care about their fate. The second one beginning the moment that they separate until today with all the action and etc...

At times it tried to rely on quick witty commentary too much and left plot to be desired. I think it's important to have expectations about this movie going into it. It's not the same MCU you've seen and that's not a bad thing I think. It is different but I supposed that's the point of this movie. The characters sometimes fall a little flat and impersonal but sometimes shine. I would've like to seen more about them individually to gain a stronger connection to the characters. The talks of them being family but yet seemingly not acting that way. I personally liked it and I could understand why people are disappointed in this movie. I don't think the length did this movie any favors. I think a shorter movie would've done this film some favor. Anyways, I think the movie is pretty and shows fantastic directing. The writing is where the movie struggled, it seemed to falter where it mattered most at times. The acting was really good considering some flat dialogue throughout. I understand critic and praise of this movie. In conclusion watch the movie yourself.

529,isakbergens,One the most underrated mcu movies ever,9,5 November 2021,"This was an extremely interesting movie with probably the most complex script the mcu has had. The conflicts, structure, the moral dilemmas, character relations and just the way it all plays out hand in hand is on such a complex level that I, when watching it, couldn't quite believe that 1. I was watching a marvel movie and 2. The reception to it has honestly been as bad as it has.As someone who studies scriptwriting I can't help but feel sad about the fact that once Marvel dares to be complex, to try new things and break out of their formula, they recieve massive criticism for it. On top of being one of the most advanced stories to come out of Marvel so far, it is one of the most inclusive. I loved the representation in the heroes, they all looked and talked different, and nothing was forced. It was just a natural reality, which reflects the real world much more accurately than say the Avengers where the big majority are American white guys. Apart from being inclusive in that sense, they had the first deaf super hero (played by an actual deaf person), and the first openly gay marvel hero. These are such important things to include and represent on the big screen, to send the message that there is no ""right"" way to be, but rather that everyone is okay the way they are, and everyone can be superheroes. The best thing about this is that none of the character traits were the main focus or even the most interesting part of the characters, but rather just natural elements of them, like any other. It's just an amazing job and a wonderful initiative on Marvel's front.It deeply saddens me that this movie has gotten as bad reviews as it has, and I honestly can not begin to fathom why.

Guardians of the galaxy earnt the love it has via building the characters in such a way that the audience cannot help but care.The eternals however is sort of just thrust upon us with obvious questions to tick the box casting and characters. Which inevitably makes it hard to care. . The humour is as funny as a root canal .""Least we will have front row tickets to the end of the world""The action is sparse and Boring. Overlong and I was persevering with it to see the famed end credits only to see cgi so bad its straight out of polar express . Pip the troll looks wack.

Paired with never seen before visuals for both quiet scenes and action scenes. You can indeed argue that some dialogue were repeating and not truly necessary, but for the main characters, Ikaris and Scersi, the deepdive into their world via dialogue is inevitable. It is a lengthy movie we're casuals got a lot to unpack. In fact, you encounter 8 characters plus a minor love interest plus several historical scenes, which needs to digest at first, but it is in my opinion very well done and presented. Also it is fun, I really laughed had at some scenes.Transitions & Storytelling & Worldbuilding: 4/5

Firstly, this does not feel like a Marvel film and honestly after the what feels like 50 or so films, this does not feel like a bad thing.Clearly the director was focusing on the more human element of the ironically non-human characters but for me this worked really well. The action was also well executed and stands up with the best of the super-hero movies.Few little gripes for me was that Angelina Jolie was massively underused, which is a shame as her character was arguably one of the most interesting.

538,simao_zambelli,Great potential and a unusual movie for the MCU,8,9 November 2021,"It's true, it's not a typical MCU movie and, in my opinion, that's refreshing. Marvel took a risk with Eternals, tying to sophisticate the storyline and bring a never before seen representation in big blockbuster movies, and it works, in a way... The movie underperforms precisely because it tries to achieve to much in a limited amount of time with the biggest cast of leading characters I've ever seen, which left them, for the most part, underdeveloped (kinda like what happened in The Crimes of Grindewald). Putting that aside and understanding the bigger scope of the story, it's really worth the watch. The Eternals focuses more on the characters moral conflict with the task they've been given then the typical evil vs good story we've all seen before. The ""we don't interfere"" plot line had me skeptical until I saw how, even for the characters, it wasn't natural, and the the burden and the toll it that took on them and their relationships. This movie also have to be praised in the amazing visual effects and directing by Chloé Zhao, it has some National Geographic levels of visuals. I do believe this movie and this story has potential and that we need to be more realistic and recognize the good and the bad, giving it a fair feedback. Because this way we, as fans, have a shot in putting constructive criticism out there and help pave the way to better content!Ps: It has two post credits scenes and both are worth it.Have a great movie ;)",Eternals

Eternals' runtime is 2:30 hours and 90% of it Zhao spent on intruducing 12 new characters to the audience. And she achieved a success in this hard task, but Chloe needed to sacrifise action. Only 5 minutes of fights were actually impressive.Eternals discusses 3 important, elevated topics that were discussed in a lot of other stories. Nevertheless, it's impossible these days to create something actually new and fresh. This picture also has problems with pretentious dialoges and phrases that make eyes roll.Acting is good. Richard Madden is great especially. My question to critics: how come Black Widow deserves a fresh rating, but Eternals don't? This is just madness.",Eternals

The emotion fell completely flat, the humor was cheesy and forced, the villain was extremely lame, and over all, Eternals seemed to be living a pointless and purposeless existence which made this entire film feel purposeless.

544,carlosfrodg,"Great movie, but short timed even with that much screen time",7,6 November 2021,"It was a good movie, very different from what Marvel has done which is good because they're moving on another direction. More mature, dark, philosophical and with a serious tone on the most part. However, as the direction goes different the issue for people who aren't fans of marvel, haven't watched all the movies, and also have knowledge far away from the MCU, but comics is that the movie is way more complex than previous ones. So they start the movie expecting you to know at least the basics of each character, which for some people is not enjoyable. Maybe if they had more time to introduce all of the characters in a previous 10 chapter mini-series before the movie or something similar it would've been better, because it is impossible to present that many characters in one movie. Apart from that great visuals, good storyline, not perfect because some of the scenes are jumping in time but it still understandable. Such great acting as well. The only bad thing of this movie is that it left me needing more, I felt like the story was not completed for many characters and they were killed without letting us know about them and it's disappointing that we won't ever as well. 7, 000 thousand years of history that wants you to explore more. On the end, it was fast but enjoyable. P. S I really needed more of Salma in the MCU such a shame that an important character and actress as her got a weak storyline and we won't see her in the future.",Eternals

I could have been better.",Eternals

Though the explanation of why they weren't involved more and helped more is lacking. You get more emotionally invested in the characters than you've been in the past MCU. There's more intimacy than a standard MCU movie which is a lot😂 but it's nice to see that the movie doesn't hide it. Much more representation, a LGBTQ character introduced ( I think it's the first in any major superhero universe, correct me if I'm wrong), we also got a character who is specially-abled.I will definitely recommend it to someone who is tired of the usual MCU troupes and want something fresh, and anyone who loves the old formula don't worry you will have more than enough of that too.MCU is turning a new leaf, let's support them and see where it leads us.Thanks for reading.",Eternals

552,wla-90072,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in theaters,2,8 November 2021,"I often get lost in the nitty gritty of philosophical thinking, as any healthy, growing, young thinker does. This is normal, we often delve deep into the question of what entertainment actually is. There are so so many variables in the regression of viewing a motion picture that determines the relationship that we all as humans use. For me, well, for me the grading of such things go usually unscathed. For example I had previously seen the first rendition of the suicide squad movie of the DC comics extended universe. Perhaps it was with my youth at the time of the release (17 in 2016), but I did not despise the movie. As so many well respected media sources lambasted the picture on the world wide web, I was sitting, entertained with the movie that was presented to me. But as I grew older, as my legs grew longer, I had come into my own in terms of what I should enjoy in a motion picture. I had crossed the threshold of looking past the attractive people on the screen, the beautiful choreographation of fight scenes, the awe-inspiring colors of lasers blasting people, and began to see movies for what they really are; Stories, movies are stories. And the story that was presented to me in this new rendition of a marvel movie was absolute abhorrence. There is not a single one of these new eternal characters that I thought was a good character. Actually I lied, I liked the flash's female counterpart who was deaf. The reason I liked her was because she never spoke to make me hate her like the rest of the characters. There were so many new characters in this movie that it was like the ""terrible and triumphant"" backstories of each character were fighting more than the actual characters.To kick things off I want to say that the major problems I have in this movie resides in many different aspects. For one the overcrowded plot attempting to piece backstories and things together in an incredibly inconsistent, and unappealing manner. The predictable nature of the plot that allows for convenience going foreword. The movie time jumps like crash bandicoot from one time period to another for no reason other than to add some advocation into the movie, because what is a movie without virtue signaling the next big thing to print votes.The movie loved to gas up the fact that Angelina Jolie was in this god forsaken movie, like they were really selling it that she was in the movie. Like if I were to buy a ticket to this movie, than angelina jolie would come thru the screen and tell me how to get a girlfriend. But the way I saw it, Angelina Jolie was in the movie for maybe 6 minutes, had like 3 lines, then died off screen. The most forgettable character by far. If these characters were even remotely Interesting I would have bothered learning their names, but instead I have to refer to them by how I remember them. Big nose annoying boy who stopped the Spanish Conquest of the Yucatan. Next up we have the moody lip injection of the group. This entire line of the story was forgettable, for instance, I forget what these characters even did. All I know is that her boyfriend with the sockem bopers on his hands ate it to give the squad that push to save the world or what ever.Next we should talk about the story. For the story to be believable, and for me to get behind it, people need to do things that make sense based on their personal motives, and people need to make decisions that make sense given the circumstances. This was violated probably hundreds of times in this movie. Like the little sprite character with orange hair wanted to kill humanity because it loved the superman rip off as well as wanted to be human but was also aligning with the side that was aiming to destroy humanity. Next we have the deviant that became sentient's only goal was to eat intelligent life, he fights the eternals with his boys the entire movie, but in the end when the eternals want to save the world that would continue to give this clown purpose, he choses to align with the side of the laser eyes guy. This makes no sense unless the deviants goal was to just oppose the majority of the eternals like a modern day contrarian. He was also spitting out a bunch of wanna be deep quotes from his CGI mouth but they were all forgettable, I couldn't name a single word that thing had said.To wrap things up this clunky movie felt like was just kind of slapped together with too much information, as well as too much plot armor and convenience that just didn't work for me. To send things off I am going to legally plagerize the report of the weeks famous quote ""My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.""",Eternals

Its concept is genuinely intriguing, and there's so much for the movie to explore...and it just doesn't. It misses the mark almost constantly. The characters are undeveloped, Gemma Chan and Richard Madden's chemistry is very poor and they give unusually flat performances (given that they are wonderful actors). Angelina Jolie's character, Thena, is one of the better characters, which is absolutely due in part to Jolie's commanding screen presence. But even she feels underwritten. There are some emotional beats in the film that I feel just aren't impactful. The movie works best when the team is together and working off their chemistry with each other, but there is unfortunately not a whole lot of that and a whole lot more exposition. The script, by the way, is awful. It is completely devoid of nuance. The dialogue is the most cliche, uninteresting dialogue you could possibly imagine. It's kind of tragic, because the whole cast is really giving it their all with the performances, but the screenplay is genuinely such a mess that it undermines the actors' performances. This movie should have been better. There are worse superhero movies, but this is among the ones I don't have much interest in watching again. Venom is a terrible film, but at least I can have fun with it. I can't really say the same for Eternals. It's too poorly-paced and too long. What a letdown.",Eternals

A diverse, well-casted group of actors with stunning visuals, an Oscar-winning director, and what do people have a problem with - the plot?? I've been trying to wrap my head around why most reviews are calling the plot ""a mess"" and ""too complicated"" and the only thing I can come up with is that people were expecting more of the same from Marvel. I am a huge MCU fan, but most of their plot points up until now have been fairly cut-and-dry and easy to follow. (Probably to also grab a younger audience.) This one is not. They are trying to explain the origin of the universe while introducing an ensemble cast of 10+ new characters, so yes the runtime is long at 2 hours and 37 minutes, but I think they did a beautiful job introducing each of these characters. The film itself is character-driven and each of them grappling with their own immortality and humanity.So, if you are looking for another simple plot with tons of action scenes or explosions that your 6-year old will love, this isn't it. You have to pay attention for this plot to make sense. They are trying something new with this film and I am loving it! Not your everyday Marvel movie, which is a good thing.",Eternals

Great action and visuals, like always. Loved the humor, just super funny at times. Great philosophical and moral questions. I think the characters were overall great. A good plot twist or two.BAD:
Some of the characters got shorted on screen-time and development (but what do you expect when they're are 10 of them). This even included the ""big bad"" deviant, who was totally under-utilized in all respects. Also fairly inconsistent in how some characters are treated/utilized (e.g. Is Sprite childish, or is she mature like a 7000-year-old should be?)

At some points it can get a bit confusing but you can follow the Story at every point.I won and lost with that movie but I absolutely adored it.Critics said they missed the action it was too much storytelling but that's just not fair. Not every movie needs constantly fighting sequences. The movie lives from the storytelling you understand and start to like the eternals because of it. This kind of storytelling gives them a heart. You need the beginning and the whole story to feel something for them. Imagine to just get thrown into a story without knowing anything. You would be lost. I respect why some people say it can get a bit too long sometimes or kinda ""messy"" but we always needed the background story of our hero's to love them. The mcu would be nothing without background story's and the beginning of ours hero's and how they even had the chance to become our hero's.Go in there open minded for something new and you won't be disappointed.",Eternals

I personally loved seeing Gemma Chan take on one of the leading roles and truly appreciated the diversity I saw on the big screen. The humour was welcomed too with stunning visuals and great action sequences.Having said that, it took far too long to get to the point. I felt it was unnecessary to continuously jump back and fourth between the different time periods, or rather this could have been done more elegantly and not so sporadically. The entire storyline of Ikaris killing Ajak felt predictable and the death of the remaining deviant was anti climatic. I also found it disappointing how Kingo chose to sit the last battle out due to differences of opinion.The post credit scenes didn't impress me either, with Harry Styles joining the Marvel Universe as Eros (Thano's brother)...

This is far better, both in its storytelling and cinematography than The Snyder cut of Justice League.Fans of comics and Jack Kirby in particular will enjoy it, MCU & superhero film fans will prefer Venom 2.

580,simplygk,More of an origin story than anything...,7,3 November 2021,"The movie goes more into the origins of the eternals and gives you an insight into each of their personalities. Don't go in expecting an all out established set of characters kicking ass from start to finish. The story is fairly well told but I must admit that it does lack some action but the action you do get is very well done and visually stunning, especially those that feature Thena (Angelina Jolie) and Makkari the speedster. It is hard to see how these characters will have a future intertwined with the rest of the MCU stories but it does day ""the eternals will return..."" at the end.",Eternals
581,jtcnight,The MCU movie you didn't know you wanted.,8,6 November 2021,I must say that as even the MCU known for taking bold swings with genres within the superhero genre this one might have been the boldest one yet. I had high expectations for this film and even though I had assumptions for it that were not met Chloe Zhao still managed to craft something that exceeded those expectations. Almost from the beginning the story is engrossing and very expansive to a level that even the Avengers films never attempted. The characters are well crafted and treated deferentially from the outset. I am sure everyone will have their own favorites but mine was definitely Angelina Jolie as Thena.If you leave all expectations at the door and just let the story before you unfold I believe this film is one that will definitely command rewatching again and again. There are also two post credit scenes with clearly outline the future of the MCU so be sure to stay and see.,Eternals
582,salazar-55843,A different take on a superhero story,9,7 November 2021,I loved this!!! Not sure why the early hate but this was done beautifully. Maybe it's not EndGame but we don't always need the same kind of superhero movie.Character driven and took its time telling its story. And the action sequences were done amazingly and looked so cool. This was not the movie I thought I was gonna see from the trailers but the surprises were brilliant!! The cast all worked so well together!!! I definitely will go and pay to see this again!,Eternals
583,jackmur-24862,Too much going on,5,6 November 2021,"I mean I enjoyed most of the film but when it came to the end it just became too ridiculous. Are we meant to believe that none of the avengers would notice a 2000 feet monster coming out of the earths core? Also the introduction of Eros(Mr Styles) seemed so forced and unnecessary. The MCU has always been calculated and well planned but the introduction of these Gods (Celestials) who have a power that cannot be matched creates so many problems for marvel and no one really wanted to see 2000 feet beings in the first place ? Also they are using the earth as some Matrix like thing!? So beyond stupid . The film itself was good but it's too much too soon especially after Kang, Multiverse the Dark Avengers there's already enough going on...",Eternals

592,filmhyt,A different MCU take,8,6 November 2021,"Eternals is a movie that will get more respect and appreciate over the time. Although I'd personal liked some parts of the movie, it still has some major flaws which pulled this film from being a masterpiece.I'll go through things that I liked and then move to ones I didn't care about.Okay, right from the beginning, this movie is just gorgeous. The cinematography is spectacular - every location is unique and unbelievable beautiful. The action scenes, though there were only three of major ones, were great, entertaining and kept me at the edge of seat.The characters were all amazing and the acting was absolutely fantastic across the board. My favourite character in this film was Thena played by Angelina Jolie. Once again Jolie proves that she always understands the assignment. She had the depth that her character needed. Thena's fight scene with Ikaris was just BOMBASTIC! Loved her and all that she did in this movie.My second favourite character is Makkari. Loved her CGI effects and her personality. My third and fourth favorite characters are Sersi and Phastos. Loved them both, especially Phastos at the end, we he was fight against Ikaris with Thena and Makkari.Sersi was great aswell, though I would've loved to see what she is capable of doing and maybe her powers should've been explored more. I also found Ajack to be pretty interesting, but I was disappointed that she died very early in the film. Ikaris was great both as a protagonist and antagonist. I think that he was just too overpowered. Kingo and Gilgamesh were both fine, didn't care about either of them. Sprite was the least character in my opinion. I tried to relate to her, but just couldn't do that, and her love-thing with Ikaris was just uncomfortable to watch.Now let's talk about things that I didn't care about. Sadly, the story is the first thing in this list. It was messy and had too many time jumps which were poorly made. Also it had too much exposition. Plus some of the plot details were just too confusing for a standard MCU viewer aka casual audience. The story also had too much drama and too much talking. The love triangle didn't work at all, because I couldn't see nor believe that there was something between Sersi and Ikaris or Sersi and Dane therefore it completely failed in delivering any emotional weight.The origin of eternals was just too confusing. The film didn't have enough action scenes to keep movie from being boring and tedious at the times.At the end, even with all its flaws, Eternals is a solid MCU film with gorgeous cinematography and great action scenes. Plus, it succeeded in making diversity a natural part of the movie - nothing was forced and none of the characters were special because of it.I'd say that the film is a 8/10 for me. It unfairly has the lowest RT score, but I hope that the audience will save this film from being a flop.",Eternals
593,eviemcalpine,It's up to the viewer,9,10 November 2021,"I personally loved the movie; I loved the storyline, diverse characters and their chemistry and the visuals are just amazing. If you like a more complex storyline and a build-up of the plot, then this movie is for you! My only criticism is that I did lose my concentration closer to the climax of the film, but the end fight scene really made up for it.",Eternals
594,fhfjyfvc,It was stunning!,8,8 November 2021,"I'm definitely a marvel fan, but there were still a few moments I felt were off in the movie. However, overall it was a beautiful movie that made me care about each individual character and want to learn more about - something I've missed in some previous team-up marvel movies. The actions shots were wonderful & had the best speedster fight sequence without a doubt, & the story was constantly making you re-think the characters & their morals. It was definitely different from the classic Marvel, but that's what made it unique & interesting. Worth seeing in my books and easily a top ranking marvel film... not number 1 but far from their worst.",Eternals

600,mchk-79690,Watch it for yourself,9,6 November 2021,"The only thing ""bad"" about this movie is that they allowed people who claim to ""love the MCU"" watch it. Too many people are coming on here and acting like they know how to write a movie, the characters, their stories, and how to direct and make a movie. Watching a lot of movies doesn't make you an expert. This movie was great, was it different from other Marvel movies? Absolutely, but in a good way! I loved it, and so did my kids. It was a great cast of characters, and I feel like it's purpose in the MCU isn't late, like others have claimed. One thing about Marvel is they always make sure everything ties in together, they did it for 10yrs leading up to Endgame, I'm pretty sure they'll do it again. Honestly, don't bother with reading the reviews that are below an 8 because I guarantee they were either written before it came out, or it's just people trolling because they have nothing else better to do with their time.",Eternals

Afcours it has its fair share of flaws but definitely better than the reviews .The director Chloe tried her best to develop the 10 eternals during the short span of the movie so it's a slow paced one and minimalistic stunts justify the whole nature of the film ' not an action packed super hero movie ' which might have disappointed the fans .As a conclusion it's a big scale drama and slightly phylosophical movie who's characters happens to be super heros....",Eternals

Not great, or amazing, just a good film that I enjoyed at the cinema.Story was good, I liked the characters, effects were top notch as always with Marvel and I wasn't bored once.The reason I believe that the film hasn't had the best reviews is that it didn't once give me that ""Marvel"" or ""Avengers"" feel.

Also the movie has some smoothest,eye soothing action scenes,Those are compeletely new to MCU. But there are few moments I felt a little unbalanced about Action scenes & Emotional Scenes yet I think it bought some Dark vibe to the movie, I think character development of the movie was not perfect, also the ending was not much of a woowy.

It's nearly 2022, get your heads out of your straight, white minds' and deal with the fact that Marvel is becoming what it should be: diverse.Now, onto my review! I loved this movie! Chloé Zhao did an incredible job with the world-building around this new plot for setting up the new phase of the MCU. Not only that, the cast worked so well together to bring these characters to life. The on-screen connection between Gemma Chan's Sersei and Richard Madden's Ikaris made me go through so many emotions. And I was so happy to see that Phastos's marriage with his husband wasn't pushed to the side, we actually got to see them be cute and care for their son together.Overall, I loved the plot, the visuals, and the cast. I can't wait for this to be continued!",Eternals

I get to know about the characters and see how close they are too each other, plus we get to see how human they really are. The ending was nice, and unexpected, especially the post-credit scenes.

614,xenophonmail-08104,A generally good film,8,7 November 2021,"Before watching the movie I had some concerns having read all of the reviews. Is it long? It isn't though at all exhausting in my opinion. It is as long as it needs to be in order to explain what is happening. The eternals are a new part of the marvel universe, in movies at least, and therefore it needs those two and a half hours to make you understand what the eternals actually are.In addition, what was also really good about the movie is the visual effects being marvel but also the fight scenes( not as good as Shang Chi though) and the acting which has a significant role ,as far as i am concerned, in maintaining the audience' s attention throughout all of the movie. Furthermore, the comedy in the movie helps humanise the characters and makes them more relatable.I hope more films like this will come from marvel in the future to expand the MCU.",Eternals
615,syysqcwm,"This is really good, although may not be for everyone",9,4 November 2021,"So I have a lot to say.It's beautiful and I'm sure most will like it. I think the pace was fine, the story starts quickly without too much introduction. At no point it felt slow or boring to me, there are no notable filler scenes and everything is there for something or for the characters' development, there is always something new to discover, a surprise or a twist. I actually wanted to go to the bathroom when it started and went until the very end because I was so hooked on the plot lol. Wasn't expecting it but it has a lot of action, although it works really well with the story and doesn't feel unnecessary.It definitely falls outside the Marvel formula, it has a different and much more mature tone without childish jokes, although it's still funny and made me laugh (and my theater) several times. It's normal to forget that you are watching an MCU movie, it happened to me most part of the movie. It may not be to everyone's taste but at least for me and my friends who watched it was pretty good.It's a thought provoking movie, it doesn't tell you what is right or who the villain is, it's up to you from the perspective you want to take. Still considered the story is very clear and not confusing. I think what stands out the most is characters' development, they all are interesting and relatable, they have flaws.I also didn't pay much attention to it because I was hooked on the story but it's visually stunning. The cast is perfect and they are very talented, every scene looks natural, and without question Chloe Zhao's direction is great. I really want to watch the film again.I feel like it lacked something, maybe it's because I had very high expectations but I'd give it 9/10.",Eternals

618,smugram,Doesn't deserve the hate,8,8 November 2021,"After hearing reviews about this film., I'd decided that this might be the marvel film to break the running streak for me since dark world.Glad to say I was wrong.Firstly this doesn't feel like a marvel film, atleast not untill the post credit scenes (which are worth staying for), but that isn't a bad thing it feels different because it is.Yes the plot is long but the film needed to get a lot of information in, this is definitely a film that will benefit from disney plus at somepoint because their could be many spinoffs set at different time periods giving you time with some of the more underused characters.The cast was great I had no reference or idea who thease characters were so I was pleasantly surprised about how quickly I found that I cared for them. Because its a large cast people will have their favourites ( Theana, Sersi, and Phastos for me) but I'm so interested to see more of the others.Visuals - just stunning...nothing else needed to sayDoes this have a great mcu villain....no....did it need one, not at all.Because this film is about far more than good vs bad.If you missed that then you missed most of the point of the filmWas it the best mcu film no but it definitely in my opinion stands up there with the rest, head held high.",Eternals
619,obsessivereader-58248,Ok. Very Middle of the road. Iron Man 2 was better.,5,7 November 2021,"I had heard about all the bad reviews, but I'm the optimistic type because I absolutely love the two Venom movies. I walked into the theatre with very low expectations. I did the same with Michael Bay's TMNT movies and actually enjoyed them even though in reality they're both complete trash. Sadly, this wasn't the case with Eternals. The whole movie had the stank of pretense all over it. I did quite enjoy the Bollywood star Kingo, the angsty Peter Pan type, Sprite and the butt kicking but strangely sensitive Gilgamesh. I also thought that the action sequences were quite cool. I jumped when the deviant swooped in out of nowhere and grabbed Ikaris. Now, that being said, the pacing in this film was awful. I whispered to my wife I'm bored on more than one occasion. I'm usually not the one to talk during a movie but I don't think anyone cared because we all shared a hive mind when it came to what we were watching. I don't have a problem when a movie is long. For example, Endgame is the longest MCU film yet but it goes by like the snap the of a finger (literally) This however feels like an eternity (ok I'm finished with the puns for now). I feel if they would have replaced one of the boring characters with Patton Oswalt's Pip the Elf, who shows up in the mid credits scene, I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more! Closing argument. Don't even bother red boxing it. Definitely don't buy it. Not even on Black Friday. Wait till it's free on Disney Plus!",Eternals

However what it doesn't deserve is audience praise, that I know. It's the same exact thing that marvel serves up in half of its films, suffers from the same villain problems, and doesn't develop its large ensemble cast enough to make any of them really sympathetic. It wasn't an awful movie, however after movies like Ragnarok, Guardians of the Galaxy, Endgame, Civil War, Winter Solider, and Infinity War, I'd expect more from marvel than another Thor The Dark World or Age of Ultron.

Honestly, I already knew the critics had mixed thoughts about it, but I wanted to see it for myself.The criticism is accurate. It is bad.I guess we all had the feeling that Marvel did a great job building up the story from the Avengers, and that releasing a movie with so many new heroes at once could be a mistake. Well, that's what it was.Having that singer in the post credit scene... what was that? Dude, you already mentioned BTS and even played their song (which should've been enough as a sign you didn't trust your film to succeed by itself) but then to add him too? The whole movie felt like a sketch from SNL with a special guest.Honestly, I am not looking forward to the next movies from Eternals. I am hoping next month I'm not disappointed by the spider-man one, and I don't even care if all three actors are in it. I just hope Marvel took their time to make a good story with good dialogues.I could go on with more but I don't want to spoil the movie seeing this is the first review.

628,finnhoffmann-58529,"Great concept, not many complaints, but big ones",7,3 November 2021,"So, the first official critics rated Eternals that low because ""it doesn't fit into the regular Marvel setting"", what is absolutely true. But why would that be a bad thing? It's bringing a breath of fresh air to the MCU. The whole cast is bringing a good performance, there are many beautiful shots, camera work is good as well and the music by Ramin Dadjawi is unlike any Marvel soundtrack we've had before. Yes, the story isn't the MCU mainstream that we already know, but that's within the best thing about the movie. Also there are some twists that you don't see coming(provided you don't know the exact leak) which causes some conflicts among the Eternals.The negative points:
-CGI. In like 2/3 of the movie the CGI is actually looking pretty good, but there are also a LOT of scenes(especially in the last act) where the visuals look really horrible, so that you wonder if you're watching an animated movie.-final: yes of course, after a movie with a story that is something new and creative we have to make a big CGI-puke where the world needs to end again, we are not spared from it. A pity
charakters: !maybe a really really small spoiler! Some charakters that were great announced with their names totally fall by their wayside. One really popular actor has no scene in the whole movie from which there wasn't at least an extract in the trailers. Again....., a pity
But all over all it's still a really good movie you should experience on a big screen, because that is, what it was made for.",Eternals

The character designs (non human), are really breathtaking! So is the VFX. But that's everything nice i have to say about it.The story itself feels forced, like grasping for straws. I was hoping for a more down to earth marvel movie, an origin story of sorts. But once again our heroes are somehow saving the universe, in a world where its citizens probably shouldn't make any long term investments, since the world seems to be in danger every 2 years.If you've watched any other avengers movie, stay home.

In the whole movie there was no knowledge about mutants and that disappointed me very much, the Eternals are here weakness 3 of them died and that's good so they don't get overpowered. But one big thing that bothers me in all mcu films is that a lot of disasters happen and none of the superheroes (so like avengers has come). In the end I found that this film is very, very good as a standalon, which I really liked, but it just doesn't fit into this earth where our avengers are settled, so I hope from marvel in the future that they will settle films in other parallel universes like waht we see in waht if let .",Eternals

Those dumbheads keep on chanting MCU is making clichéd movies and will fxxk up soon.. Now their ____ are on fire because they revoked their formula?Eternals doesn't include any tony stark like playboy things.. Nor does it contain bloodshed. It is well suited for the philosophical thinkers and theorists with a bunch of foreshadowing elements and emotional drama. Best for the people who think The last season's of Game of Thrones is a little bit justifiable (still it ain't that good).It focuses on relationships and morality.. The crude question of where does our true allegiance lie? And what actually morality is..For the d**kheads who are rating without watching the movie..Go..have some fresh air.. Because you're not out of the nests that the outdated traditions taught you. There ain't anything awkward in seeing two men kiss..This movie is seriously bombed by the homophobic b**tards.People who expect Endgame like experience will surely be upset because this is just a basement building upto a massive eternal flick with Arishem the judge owing to grant our planet its judgement day. More celestials to come.. Kudos to the actors and the vfx team.. The massive towering celestials were the best in this film. Kit Harington does know a lot of History in this movie(He is a professor in natural history museum) But he still doesn't know anything about himself 😂NB: Thanos has a hot brother out their..

Who gives a squids bottom what the keyboard 'critics' or 'movie polls/scores' suggest...this had a great cast and superb visuals based on an unusual comic book that has translated well onto the big screen.At last we get to see the grand scale of the celestials, ominous and threatening and also a glimpse of the main characters who have lived many lives through the passage of time. Their hopes, ambitions, flaws makes for interesting developments in future instalments.Probably one of the most tricky of marvel adaptations to pull off, the direction is faultless and certainly captures that epic scope with both its big operatic action sequences and more intimate scenes.Only downsides was the deviant designs that are all too similar in modern science fiction fare but it's the grand celestial designers that more than make up for them.It also works well as a separate entity of the other marvel films and carries its own weight with heroism and grandeur that certainly opens the portals to the bigger marvel universe that fully embraces the heroes and legends of old as well as the future cosmic ensembles yet to come.I'm sure Jack Kirby will be puffing on his cosmic cigar with a wry smile.",Eternals

This is just laying down the foundations for which the House of Marvel will solidly stand once all the other Fox franchises that was acquired and whatever is left (Hulk/Spidey) returns and is fully realized in the MCU. This movie also is layered and nuanced enough that it actually might require one to both embrace the movie lore that was established since IronMan 1 up to present and the marvel comics mythology readings to truly enjoy this masterpiece. Otherwise without knowledge of the other this movie will truly make one scratch their head since both are required in order to appreciate what was created.",Eternals
641,djkymjon,The problem is...,10,9 November 2021,"Critics are looking for a villain that is clear cut but the problem is, there are no CLEAR CUT VILLANS in this story coz the movie is actually a morality play - meaning what is the RIGHT THING TO DO versus WHAT MUST/SHOULD BE DONE? Does the end justify the means etc etc. And to the moviegoer who has followed all the MCU movies since Iron-Man 1 this movie is not that kind of fun GOTG kind of movie because this is the Mythology of the Marvel ""Comics"" Universe being established for the present day Cinematic Universe for which without it the origin stories of mutants/inhumans/fantastic four etc would be hard to bring to screen. That's why it's confusing to someone who never read the source material nor has been engrossed in the comics of Marvel before these movies have ever been made.

Who ever decided she would be a good fit for a marvel movie made a huge error. Thankfully the remaining 30 minutes of the movie were very enjoyable.

I wish I had gone with my gut feelings about skipping this one, but I went in anyways after checking 6.9 IMDB rating reluctantly.Writing is a backbone of any movie and CGI is a branch of that spine.

I enjoyed Eternals, but not because it was fun and action packed.My first thoughts coming out of the theater were:
1) This movie needs even more story building, character backgrounds felt glossed over, making them feel hollow and one-dimensional. Not enough time given to any single one to connect with. Oddly enough, the one I found most interesting was Druig. I loved that he can control people and his center was to end conflict, never anything self-serving. And introducing his love arc with Makkari was frustrating because it's another of many stories, we didn't get enough background on to really connect.2) Wasn't much fun to watch. The jokes and personalities were lost in building up the cosmic narrative. I did love the story and found myself reconciling the trade-off as not only a cosmic origin story, origin of Celestials and Eternals, but the new overarching phases leading up to Cersi's trial. It's going to be Epic! I hope.3) I loved the one deviant that was absorbing powers and consequently, becoming a viable enemy. It's too bad it was only one, and also lost out to the internal conflict within the Eternals.4) WTF is with no Avengers to be found anywhere??! They're all there when Aliens attacked New York, they ALL on holiday now? As integral they are to the MCU, even if not front and center for the new MCU phases, not including them is a misstep.5) Again, want more time with characters. To explore Thena's memories and past battles could be epic! I need more Druig and Makkari.6) The think I liked most about this movie was it separated itself as something of higher storytelling, extraordinary entities beyond what we've ever seen in the MCU, and does excite me for more from the story arc. Hope they don't abandon it to the likes of other movies.",Eternals

Genuinely terrible performances and poor,wooden characters. I was worried over this before I even saw the film...Such lazy filmmaking in my opinion.

659,dnarcissi,Please give this a shot,8,7 November 2021,"The movie, in my opinion, was not a slow, unemotional mess. The characters are incredibly fun to watch and their relationships/conflict are what carry the movie. There was only one moment in the film that I felt dragged on a few minutes longer than it needed to, but it immediately picked up again after that. It was diverse, but not in a preachy, political way. The differences in the characters were empowering and actually aided their characters identities. I think this movie is so contested because it doesn't it the marvel formula as well as other movies (so it is jarring to the marvel fans who crave movies like Ant-Man) and it is a blockbuster superhero movie so it deters the art/critic group. If you put labels aside, this is visually beautiful movie about 7,000 year old superheroes confronting the possibility of death. If that sounds appealing to you, I encourage you to ignore what others are saying and see it for yourself. I would like more experimentation like this in big blockbusters in the future. I think this one boils down to a matter of preference. I gave it an 8 because personally, watching it brought me great joy, I loved the characters and themes, and I felt it was above average. I'm curious to see how time will treat this one. I imagine it will be like many of Jack Kirby's post-60's works: maybe a little too high-concept and hard to digest at the time, but worth a go to see the artists vision.

I don't know for sure. All I know is, as of right now, the franchise feels more like Star Wars. The originals were great.

There was a large ensemble cast so I never expected all of the characters to achieve the same amount of development but it was nice to see such an inclusive cast where gender, ethnicity and sexuality received representation without it being forced into the story.The time spent following the lives of the Eternals raises many philosophical and existential issues which shows the true colours of the protagonists. They are a family unit and it was interesting to watch the emotional weight behind their decision making. They all had their own views and motivations which made this more than just a good Vs evil movie.The movie features a lot of exposition which can take up too much screentime at moments. This, I think is where the movie suffers from a mixed pace. It's difficult to show alot of the information that is needed when this movie features a lot of cosmic lore. It tries its best to show visuals with exposition at least.The action and music was really exciting in this movie and it was fun to watch the Eternals use their powers in different ways. The conflict in the final act felt personal to each of them and so I was emotionally invested in how it would come to a conclusion.Overall, I think Eternals gave us an original story with the usual superhero tropes we've come to love making it new but familiar!",Eternals
674,tahafaruqi,Just not very engaging,2,6 November 2021,"The trailer had me really excited for the film but it the film was a huge disappointment. I usually don't mind films that are this long but this was quite hard to tolerate. The characters were too shallow. Adding to many main characters made me not care about them or develop a connection with them.Secondly the IMAX switching aspect ratio were a bit too much.However, apart from all the downs this film has it feels good to look at and the soundtrack is just beautiful.",Eternals
675,kylematthewalker,The first Marvel movie made by the team at DC Warner Brothers,3,9 November 2021,"This thing was all over the place. There was so much exposition and it makes no sense why. I don't think Chloe Zhao directed Cloud Atlas but she may as well have. None of the deaths or relationships were earned or carried any weight. Icarus was wasted. Thena was wasted. The stupid kid was stupid. The mind control dude didn't do any mind control. They wasted this great actor in Barry Keoghan. You could tell he was ready to give a fantastic performance and they sidelined his character. It, just wow. Marvel knows how to take bad characters from the comics and make them interesting (see Shang Chi's Mandarin) but couldn't figure out how to do that with any of these characters.",Eternals

I was nervous as h*** before watching it after the reading the reviews, but from now on I will have to stop taking their opinion into account. There were maybe four scenes with a gay superhero and suddenly it's a movie that is all about LGTBQ??? It was a mature and realistic look at what superheroes would be in the current time. I left wanting more, and I'd love to see Zhao, and renowned directors like her continue creating superhero movies.. Even if the MCU hasn't had a movie better than the Dark Night, they are definitely going in the right direction. As kids that started the journey with the MCU back with Iron Man, we deserve the MCU to keep maturing along with us with more movies like this.",Eternals

It's much better than some of the other Marvel movies. Ikaris feel like Henry Cavil Superman and after Director confirmation I'm happy with that.",Eternals

I get it, its more about having a fun experience. But this movie was just too much. I found myself looking at my watch over and over again waiting for it to be over. So many convoluted story branches and forced relationship tensions. It seriously a superhero soap opera! Including TWO stupid love triangles! The main character was bland and the story is so distracted that you can hardly call her a main character. You are constantly jumping from time period to time period, the ""twists"" are so predictable and cliche I was just angry they didn't reveal them earlier so we could wrap up the boring story. So much of this movie just felt like a corporate checklist going down the line of things that a modern superhero movie should have, not even trying to accomplish a real engaging storyline.Avoid this movie.

But OMG that movie is tiresome. I really good not to make heads or tails of it. The story was all over the place. The acting was not of the level you expect of those Marvel actors. The music, the visual designs of the and costumes... mediocre at best.But I think perhaps I was very spoiled by the last movie I saw, Dune. Dune is in a league of its own, on all levels.

The movie sucked and even all the henny on the rocks, the rum and sake I had couldn't make the experience enjoyable on either night. Eternals couldn't decide whether it wanted to adhere to the typical Marvel formula or be seen as high cinema. There are an excessive amount of characters on screen with little development if any development devoted to them or reason to care. The pacing is slow. By the time I reached the two hour point, I wanted the movie to end. And what's with the time-jumping?I enjoyed the production values on the ""historical scenes."" It makes you wonder how a modern sword and sandal movie would resemble but knowing the state of Hollywood, I doubt there would be much interest in one.",Eternals

The plot is deep and includes the same ""moral problems"" that Loki show had (Free will, purpose of existence, doing bad things for ""greater good"").Its not esthetically the best movie but cgi was good. Some characters and scenes were unnecessary, the movie would still make sense without some of them.It was a great movie, its just not every marvel fan's cup of tea due to lack of action and the plot continuing a bit slow.

There was a lot of exposition going on despite being visually stunning.I went it not expecting much of it because I wasn't familiar with the source material, I believe you should be able to enjoy a movie as is without prior knowledge. But I did have some high hopes though, the casting was on point. Three Asian actors in the main cast of a superhero movie? It's like watching a unicorn give birth, it never happens.It felt like half of the movie (on a 157 runtime) was spent on the first act, it took that long for all the protagonists to fully assemble. I know that this is Marvel and they're setting up for future instalments, but I still think they could've cut some subplots and characters.Even the credits sequence was underwhelming to me, that's usually what I look forward to, and deal breaker for me. That being said, god bless Chloe Zhao for letting Richard Madden keep his Scottish accent. And points to Disney for finally following through with the ""first openly gay character"".",Eternals

692,sagenaidoo-70513,Ignore the negativity reviews - go watch it and form an opinion based on your personal experience.,9,6 November 2021,"Eternals is a Marvel movie like no other but in a good way. Heading in a different direction from what we have seen previously, Eternals brings the MCU into a new realm of story-telling that breaks away from the typical Marvel formula.A standout aspect of this film is truly its diversity with Chloé Zhao and the rest of the team behind this film truly pulling together a truly beautiful and diverse narrative which speaks to the heart moreso than it does the mind.After years of formulaic movies, Eternals takes the MCU in a new, more mature direction and it is refreshing to see. Chloé Zhao definitely succeeded in bringing a fresh perspective into the MCU diverging from a story that is driven purely by the action and thrill of it all, to give us a story that has heart and love behind every aspect.As expected, this film was a visual masterpiece, where everything that we see manages to work alongside the story being told. The acting was amazing with Gemma Chan truly standing out and capturing the heartfelt essence that is driven by this film. Also, just to mention Angelina, a growing favourite of mine, who truly took the helm in each and every one of her scenes, bringing to life this strong and powerful warrior.The story itself definitely meets what it set out to achieve, however, it is also the key downfall point of the movie. Though it carries a lot of weight, the aspect where the movie fails is where they tried to incorporate maybe a bit too much story without truly figuring out how to go about making it fit into one cohesive puzzle.Overall, it was still an incredible watch and I cannot wait to watch it again. I would definitely go about saying that it makes it into my personal top 10 favourite Marvel movies!",Eternals

Still, far from perfect but at least a pleasant surprise.

698,clockwork-75328,A greatly presented message,9,7 November 2021,"I believe Eternal's one of the better marvel movies in terms of overall quality. The visuals are undisputedly gorgeous, and the music was notably good too. While the plot did have some minor setbacks, I don't see a clearer way the director/writer could have conveyed such a complicated project in one sitting. Some would say the movie is too long, but I think the movie is too short for what it had to cover. Eternals had great character evolution, and the lengthy duration was necessary. Some Marvel hero's require 3 movies see near the same development.I don't think a true impartial review is what this movie has been receiving. Many Marvel films with much higher reviews can't be enjoyed without a grand context, and this one works as a stand alone. Eternal is slower paced, more dynamic and has less action than the average Marvel film. Perhaps that attributes to the lower rated reviews among the other controversial inserts. However a slower paced movie that sacrifices mindless action scenes for plot development shouldn't be disgraced.Lastly, I think that the disparities represented was heartwarming and were realistic occurrences within the story. Same-sex relationships shouldn't matter conceptually speaking and the being in question doesn't reproduce. The point of the movie was to love another without pointless conflict. The ban of this movie in countries gives awareness to unjustifiable discrimination as if they were programmed to believe that way. This just so happens to be the message Eternals is trying illuminate!!",Eternals

She was influenced by Denis' Dune but that's not how you make a Kirby film. It was boring. Maybe cause I'm a New God's fans and the Eternal's is Kirbt's spiritual sequel I'm not a fan. It just dragged. Every character felt meh minus Sersi and Black Knight. But what pisses me off most is the post credit scene. Pip the Troll voiced by Patton Oswalt is an an abomination not cause of Patton cause his is my ideal casting of Pip and reminds me of how the MCU screwed up the Infinity Gauntlet (hardcore Starlin nerd) the MCU was due as failed.,Eternals

I was lucky enough to see Eternals on the 3rd of November, and it very quickly became one of my all-time favourite Marvel movies. For years, people have been crying out for Marvel to move away from the typical superhero 'formula' and Zhao definitely delivers. Eternals is a superhero movie that feels bigger than just a film. It has a depth that is missing in previous Marvel films and every aspect of the film is beautiful. The visuals are stunning, the cast is incredible and the chemistry between the main group of ten is obvious. The storyline is engaging and includes twists and turns that the audience won't see coming. Sure, it isn't as fast-moving as other superhero movies, but there are ten Eternals that need to be introduced enough for the audience to care about them and so that takes some time. However, it never feels boring and it never drags. The entire cast is incredible, but Barry Keoghan as Druig, Lia McHugh as Sprite and Lauren Ridloff as Mikkari deliver standout performances. Eternals is a breath of fresh air as it's different to your regular superhero movie, but still adds so much to the MCU and is so enjoyable. It is definitely not a movie to miss.",Eternals

It's different from the rest of the Marvel movies but that what makes it Great...They want it to be different! The last 25 marvel movies, they use the same formula so why not take that chance or give it a chance to do something we never seen in a Marvel movie before.

710,breakerer-18317,If Marvel Made a Lifetime Movie,4,5 November 2021,I have been looking forward to seeing this movie for months. The trailer looked pretty sweet and something I would love! I had hoped it would be like Dr. Strange with its quirkiness and cute humor and a spiritual edge.Well that's not anything close to what I got. I will say visually it is pretty nice but honestly nothing I haven't seen before. It's like mash up of all the past marvel movies. It felt like they just took the leftover ideas and visuals and costumes of everything from Dr. Strange to Black Panther to X-Men and tried to serve it as a 5 course meal in 2 hours and 37 mins.Half of the actors did a great job with what they were given but they couldn't make up for the other lifetime movie performances and super bad script. It all felt rushed and disjointed and the humor was trying way too hard to be like Dr. Strange and Guardians of the Galaxy but completely missed the mark because it's been done before and much better.I did appreciate the diversity and some of the symbolism but it was like being forced to take overly sugared cough syrup. The added gay family is also applauded. But yeah this feels like a shiny glossy regurgitation of great movies we have already seen and a waste of such great talent.Oh and Kit Harrington (of all people) saying I love you Sersi was too much. Come on! Some other reviewer said this feels like a bad SNL skit and I have to agree. Bleh.,Eternals

721,imiea,"Not Marvel's best work, but definitely undeserving of the hate",7,7 November 2021,"Ignore the critics and review bombs, Eternals is not bad at all.This movie has so much to offer and enjoy in its 2.5 hour run time. I will add that I went into this movie not knowing much about who the eternals are and where exactly they fit into Marvel's giant universe.Let's start with the positives. Visually, it's one of the best looking films in the MCU with stunning action sequences. The characters are quite compelling for the most part and each of them bring a different flavour to the overall story. I'm very interested to see what the future holds for each of them as the film does enough to peak further interest. The acting is very very good. The challenge with these films that introduce multiple characters in one go, is that often things can feel clustered especially if the acting sucks. However, Marvel yet again has done a great job with the casting choices for each of these characters. In typical MCU fashion, the film also contained a few comedic moments which were well timed and didn't feel forced in any way.On the down side, the film suffered a bit with its overall story. Eternals deliberately tries to be an emotional story that emphasizes the uniqueness of humankind and why its worth saving. While the message is clear enough in the film, the problem is that its just difficult to truly feel the impact of the emotional moments with a new batch of characters and in the space of just 150 minutes. I feel like Eternals would've been better off initially as a Marvel series, giving viewers time to learn more about their place in the MCU and to better connect with each of the characters. That being said, I still think the director did a pretty solid job in putting together a film with so many diverse characters without it feeling overcrowded. If anything, I have more questions now then ever before which is not a bad thing going into this new Phase of the MCU.",Eternals
722,rpg-27244,Not a MARVEL MOVIE,1,6 November 2021,"A ten??? Really? Compared to what? No way. Giving this a ten has got to be people who own stock in Disney or are blinded by the visuals or ""artistry"".I get it. It's nice to have superheroes that have observable differences that individuals can relate to and how anyone can be a hero. That doesn't make a movie great. Visual ""stunningness"" doesn't make a movie great. To be a 10, the movie has to get everything right. This movie misses on many fronts.The superpower eternals are weak. Tony Stark alone is more powerfulThere are big issues in logic. THENA slices a super charged baddie to pieces yet all times prior there is minimal damage. Ikaris has laser eyes that sometimes kill. They try to use shotguns to kill with?Supposedly no interference with mankind but we see throughout they help mankind with mankind knowing they are godlike and their names. They wear their uniforms in plain view?Very slow developing. Plenty of spots to go get popcorn and not miss anything.Unnecessary scenes. The flashbacks are unneeded, mostly. The romance of Ikaris and Serci is overdone. The amount of time explaining things to Serci is too long. Some fight scenes are too long.The cgi isn't great. Mostly for Thena.Visually stunning didn't cross my mind. Clearly the eye of the beholder.Humor is there, but limited. Action is there, but limited. The light saber battles in the original trilogy are as good as found here. Not in terms of visual stunning, but as interesting in context. That is, the action here, is nothing special.This is NOT a Marvel movie. It is a movie made by Marvel with Marvel-created characters.Save your money. Go to dinner instead.",Eternals
723,adityamallik-73270,"Eternals is different and unique like how it was quoted, but it had some issues.",7,5 November 2021,"The 25th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a very different movie than what marvel has been doing for over a decade, and I liked the concept. Its a two and half hour film but doesn't seem to be boring. Yeah it's a slow movie as compared to other MCU films but that's what makes it unique. The slow parts are also very interesting as the conversation between the Eternals makes us understand a lot of stuff which is quite important in the story. The movie was shot and edited beautifully, the Deviants had flawless designs as well as when you see the celestials you know how giant and powerful they are. Cloe Zhao's direction was pretty good.Still having so many positive points, it's not the best Marvel movie. It felt sometimes very predictable, I missed a proper ending, it was like too smooth and when it ended I was like ""Okay, that's it?"" . Also one other problem is that they are completely different from other Marvel stuff. We haven't seen a single character once and we don't relate to them as much as we relate to Thor, Spiderman etc. And then Introducing not one but TEN Eternals at time, it didn't allow me to make them emotionally attached to me as much as it needed to be. But I can't think of a better way to do it. It was just a very little time to introduce that many characters. Also some decisions they made were like WHY? To me and also in my opinion it failed to show us how powerful the eternals are. On the other hand I feel Shang Chi did a pretty good job for it.I like Marvel doing other things than usual and taking risks, I would not call it an overall bad movie, it's pretty good but it has potential to get even better. I loved the fact that its not a superhero movie filled with action scenes but also focused on the drama part, where Marvel lacked in some previous films. As a Marvel fan I have my hope that Marvel will do it better next time but it's a pretty good job overall.",Eternals

A truly incoherent film. Go watch Dune.",Eternals
726,vicky_liaoau,"Marvel's SFX are unbeatable, the cast is legendary, the storyline was amusing but the pacing...",7,3 November 2021,"I went into the theatre without setting high expectations as I usually do with the other MCU films. Since I knew that this film was meant to be slightly different to the others. Leaving the theatre, I felt a bit disheartened that I couldn't quite connect with the characters as much as I wanted to.It's inevitable with such a large A-list cast, that they would all have to divide up the screen-time & make sure each character was given enough spotlight.However, I found that even with Cersei & Ikaris claiming most of the screen time, I still couldn't find myself rooting for their relationship because I wasn't taken on that journey of how their relationship developed. Sure, there were a few montages to show they were inlove & Ikaris watching Cersei braid a little girls hair and smile lovingly at her but that really was it. Just short moments of them staring at eachother & smiling.That wasn't enough for me to really feel a connection & care for them.Infact, I found myself caring for Thena & Gilgamesh aswell as Makkari & Druig, more.The concept of their familial relationship that stemmed from the Avengers family, didn't have the same impact. We have been taken on a 10 year journey already, revolving around the Avengers & how they all fought each other and then united together.I understand that Marvel was trying to portray the Eternals as this broken up family whom once were very much united & that we should care. But I found myself wishing that they had separated Eternals into part 1 & part 2. Part 1 focussing on the Eternals & how they came to be and them in their first 5000 centuries being a close family & eventually at the end of part 1, them having to split ways. Then Part 2 them having to find eachother again & save the universe, etc.Although longer than the usual MCU runtime, 2 & 1/2 hours wasn't enough to invoke a strong emotion from me because there was too much ground to cover that they weren't able to go into depth with many things.Overall, it felt a bit lacklustre. I really tried hard to love it. Perhaps in my second watch, I will feel differently.If you're reading reviews to decide whether it's worth watching, please don't be put off by the more negative reviews. Just go into the cinema with broad mindset. I still enjoyed the movie just not as much as I wanted to.There are plenty of twists, deaths & the two post-credit scenes are very much impactful to the future of MCU.",Eternals

This is a very character-driven movie and the cast enable this movie to thrive. Despite there being a lot information thrown at you throughout, before too much complexity in the plot is revealed, the movie allows viewers to get used to all of the characters and their relationships with one another.

Because of these and several other factors such as the film's editing, ""Eternals"" ends up in fact out of line with all the MCU films and takes it to a new era, with more seriousness, drama, unforced representation and less humor, in addition to working very well what it proposes, which is expansion and detailing of the Cosmic side of Marvel universe.",Eternals
733,osemerson,ETERNALS SPOILER REVIEW,8,10 November 2021,"Eternals spoiler reviewPositive:each character was extremely likable and they were instantly all very interesting. Each character got the right amount of screen time and moments. My personal favorites were makkari, druig, and kingo. Makkari was an amazing speedster it was so cool having it that when she ran fast everything else moved just as fast so we really got to see how everything interacted with her while she was moving fast. While some humor felt out of place a lot of the jokes landed for me and I really feel like each eternal bounced off of each other very well and their chemistry was amazing. The action while fairly spread out was always enjoyable and any action scene with thena or makkari was so much fun to watch. And everytime a celestial was on screen my jaw was on the floor their inclusion was very much needed. This was the second marvel movie to almost make me cry. It's emotional moments really hit differently. The twist with ikaris blew me away and despite it being sad watching him fight his family I understand his intentions. I loved the relationship between gilgamesh and thena it was so endearing. I like that kingo didn't want to have to fight ikaris so he left. It was much more than just a pointless sidelining of a character. Ajak did such a good job as the ""mom"" of the group and it made sersi becoming the leader very worth it. Really the best parts were the characters interacting they really all nailed their parts. And kingos introduction was amazing. Without w doubt the coolest action sequence was that of the eternals fighting ikaris. Oh and one more thing the score was amazing. And this felt so different from anything we've seen in MCU and I'm so excited to see where they take it. Also the cinematography in this movie was probably some of the best in the entire MCU. It was beautiful and some of the shots were magnificent.Negatives: first off the deviants were a joke of a villain. They were all so easily disposed of except for of course the head one who did feel threatening until thena shit on him. I wish he ended up surviving so he could become a bigger threat in a potential sequel. And by the end they didn't even feel important because the eternals also had to fight off Ikaris which became the the real threat. This movie makes so many things that have happened in the MCU feel so small compared to the scale of this. It felt a little weird killing off ajak and Gilgamesh early in the movie. I also didn't really like how they kept going back to thousands of years ago. It did good to establish how they had to deal with the human conflicts and not be able to interfere but it just got tedious. Finally I wish they had given ajak more screen time to really flesh out her relationship with every eternal to make her death feel meaningful. I thought the whole side plot with sprite being in love ikaris was weird. I enjoyed her wanting to be a real person so she could live a normal life but adding in her being in love with ikaris was just uncomfortable.Consensus: with amazing characters, fun action, awesome score, and goofy humor eternals is definitely worth a watch. While it had a pretty mid villain it definitely accomplished what it was trying to do. To be different. And I have so much respect for that. And omg we are actually getting Eros in the MCU I am so so excited for his upcoming projects. Star moments for me were the characters interacting and the action which is unlike anything we've seen so far. It's not for everyone and trust me when people say it doesn't feel like a marvel movie they are definitely right. Don't go in expecting the same old thing. I thought it was great and did a number of things right while still having a few issues. Cause nothings perfect and this movie doesn't try to be. It establishes many new characters and makes us excited for what's right come. Very enjoyable and worth the watch and I am very pumped to see Danes return as the black knight. And I have one more thing to say. MCU earth is complete and utterly. Arishem is comingCharacters:9/10Story: 9/10Cinematography:10/10Action: 8/10Ending:7/10Humor:8/10Overall:8/10.",Eternals
734,solitarymaninblacksmokemonster,Great film. Ignore the negativity. Go in with an open mind.,10,7 November 2021,"I got to see Marvel Eternals. A Chloe Zhao film. It offers something different to the other films. Interesting to follow the journey of immortal beings. In the beginning the Celestials were here. They created the Eternals. But hidden in the darkness were the Deviants. This specific team are on board a ship. They head to Earth. They weren't to meddle in human affairs. You get to see what they get up to throughout the ages. Some humour. Nice bit of drama and romance. Plenty of action. You will like the special effects and soundtrack. Great cast of actors. I like the Ikaris character. Superb powers. He is handsome. I like the powers of Makkari. Richard Madden could have played Superman. The Deviants thought to have been destroyed are making a comeback. Other secrets are revealed. The heroes had split up and lived their lives as they saw fit. Sersi and Thena looking hot. The team are to report back to Arishem. Worth looking at the back story. The credits scenes need explanation. One casting choice was a surprise. I want to see how this film is connected to others. It is a pretty good film. I would ignore the reviews. There are the fake reviews written by rightwingers that don't want to see poc on the screen. They use ""woke"" ""diversity"" in a negative way. One country wants to censor the film. Ridloff is currently in The Walking Dead and Lee was in Train To Busan. Each character has a unique power. Some youtuber or blogger mentioned Mutants.

A little too much CGI and VFX but I guess they are eternal so that makes sense i suppose.Had love-hate relationship with lots of characters, mainly Druig.Love a little bit of Bollywood mashup in the movie and funny side character Karun.Looks like MCU is taking a new shape and the new villain is wayyy wayyy wayyyyyyyyy too big (shape, size and power). If i'm not mistaken, the celestial being formed a black hole towards the end, that should tell how powerful it is.Overall, loved it. Will watch it again soon.

The movie was full of great comedy, heart-pounding action scenes, stunning visual effects, and most importantly, a lot of heart. To tackle 11 new heroes in one movie is an achievement in itself, let alone the character development and history in just a short period of time.Marvel once again achieved an incredible movie.

740,ltvdeboer,mediocre film trying to develop too many characters,4,4 November 2021,"While having one of the most diverse cast it fails to develop 80% of the characters properly. The characters are so bland you see them dealing with these complex thoughts only to instantly forget about it after a peptalk. It has been done so many times that the writers put a one liner in there, pointing it out for anyone still oblivious how easily they put aside any struggle they were having.The film takes its humor from a few characters walking around dropping one liners but add nothing else to the story. Towards the end, one of the Eternals even leaves seconds before the climax to later return out of nowhere but his character was so meaningless I barely noticed he was gone.The CGI was decent but nothing spectecular you could even see where they cut from CGI to live set a few times.The story flows weirdly jumping back and forth in timelines and none of the plot twists came as shocking. The story is pretty much an Invincible copied Marvel film.Some characters were really interesting and could do well with a 2nd movie exploring and developing them more but for now they're so one dimensional each character only plays one role in the film.The scenes itself were visually beautiful but don't make up for the lack in story, underdeveloped characters and overall a weird flow of the film.

Cuz they don't have any common..Sprite's unrequited love for Ikaris made me sad.

I seen it in IMAX which is the way any movie should be viewed. The IMAX parts was out of the world literally 😂. The way she handled the film it really had me falling for these characters. She did a wonderful job. Films stars Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Kumail Nanjiani, and the main person in this flim Gemma Chan. Also Manny more. Gemma was great she really grown on me from start to finish. Richard Madden was ok I never seen his films before he good I would like to see him in more films. Kumail was the funniest one in this film but the only part is the one part with the Indian movie filming that was kinda cringy as a person with Indian background I think marvel should give it another try. Salma Hayek I love her films it's great. Was she a right choice for this role. I did you could have gotten someone a little more flexible meaning someone with the knowledge of Superhero films.

Storytelling is without structure and characters are two dimensional and have no motivation for their actions. The film is filled with plot holes that are never filled, and as a viewer I felt no concern for the protagonists, eventually being apathetic about the whole thing.I just wanted it to end, it felt like double it's actual running time and it is utterly boring.The fine cast do their best with the inferior script, but there's nothing there to work with. It looks beautiful in cinematic terms, especially if you value pretentious art house, desaturated chic.

The effects are gorgeous, there's quite a few moments that made me chuckle, the action scenes, as well as acting is good, and I LOVED the design on the celestials. I also appreciated the diverse cast that didn't seem too forced.So, with all that being said, as an asian girl who grew up on superheroes, I really wanted to like this. But I really couldn't. The first part of the movie starts with a text scroll, which, okay, a little bit of a drag to read, but it's a whole new cast of characters so the background's needed. But they do this multiple times through the whole movie where they stop for minute intervals to give us long, drawn out, uninteresting info-dumps.The two characters that were shown most, Cerci and Icarus were boring. They were supposed to be romantic interests, but god, I felt they had no chemistry other than ""hey, you're hot, I'm hot, wanna get together?"" I think this film would've hit emotionally harder if they were a better match, and we were able to mourn the loss of their relationship. Actually, I found the two other main couples in the movie really enjoyable, and I would've liked to see more of them, but they had little to no screen time.Individually, I felt the lead character was even worse. She was incredibly bland, which is a shame, because her mostly non combative themed powers are a cool concept. She had very little character development, and the final burst of power she DID have felt very deus ex machina.While I feel Icarus being a plot-twist antagonist was a good idea, I think it could've been played out better, and I wish we were shown some more of the viciousness his character had earlier in the movie.That being said, the movies obviously meant to have a sequel, and I hope for good things and more character development for the lead in it, because I do think the director is talented, and the characters do have potential, it just wasn't shown here. I wish them luck in the future.",Eternals
759,moisesmorfin,Not bad,7,8 November 2021,The movie was solid. It had a good story and the characters were interesting but there were times throughout the film that the movie slowed down and not much was going on. The CGI also threw me off a couple of times throughout the film but I will say that the action scenes were great and the humor was good. This is not the MCU's best film but is also not the worst like many are saying.,Eternals
760,HugoSena,A Useless Movie,1,8 November 2021,"This movie try to explained everything from the beginning but ended up useless, Also too many characters with no development. The fight scene is boring, and the story is predictable, and the acting is mediocre.",Eternals
761,joshsafe,Marvel in name,1,8 November 2021,"It's a far cry from what it can be. Good Effects but honestly it could have been better, in my personal opinion. The sexual scene is completely unnecessary and sets a disturbing precedent for future movies in the MCU. It's bad enough you can't watch any decent TV Show or Movie anymore with a sexual moment or 5 giving you a swift sucker punch. I get that some people like to see that kind of nonsense, but this is a superhero movie about cosmic beings. Not some Pornographic Parody. Not everyone is comfortable seeing that kind of stuff and for those who get really uncomfortable with such subject matters: it doesn't help limiting possible Entertainment choices to Childrens Tv Show and That One Film. Not everyone wants to see sex, and it's everywhere these days to the point it pauses the damn plot. This isn't Game of Thrones and we certainly don't need to be seeing the MCU morph into Porn Plaza. It shouldn't be that a marvel superhero movie is suddenly a pornographic movie with two conventionally attractive people going at it. It's Marvel, not Playboy.",Eternals
762,gpalmora,A Disappointment,2,5 November 2021,"Had high expectations I guess based from the past Marvel movies. It lacked the excitement compared to others and it made the movie feel long. It couldn't be saved by even it's well known cast. Shang-chi was a pleasant surprise even with a lesser known actor as lead I think Marvel should not be complacent that people will eat up their future Phase 4 movies after this just because it carries ""Marvel"" in it. They even included Starfox who by the way was acted so dull.",Eternals
763,OUTexan,Could have been so good.,5,8 November 2021,"So disappointed. This from someone that loves origin and backstories. Based on previews, this could have been epic. The movie was all over the place with backstories that seemed randomly inserted. Humor was good at times but did not help the overall movie which dragged. Casting was questionable and some characters were completely unconvincing. Not the usual Marvel emotional roller coaster due the lack of character development and inconsistent storytelling. Marvel knows their target audience. This movie was not it.",Eternals

Not as a marvel fan but the film has that potential its simply superb. But unluckily they havent used angelina as the main cjaracter but she is the powerful one though ppl felt it bad amd there is a gay kiss and a sec scene on marvel movie so ppl might not find that 5 to 10 seconds bad but shouldn't comsider only that and rate.

Based on some of these reviews, I was expecting it be really bad and boring. This movie is somehow being rated lower than Thor 2 which does not feel (personally) accurate. Although it is a 2 hour and 37 minute movie, I did not find myself checking the time to see when it would be over. I was fully entertained the whole time. The story of the Eternals and how they came to be was easy to follow and made sense. They did a good job of showcasing all 10 of the Eternals which is no easy feat. I did wish they had used some actors/actresses more but overall the acting was superb. This movie definitely felt important in setting up the storyline for future Marvel movies, so I'm really excited to see what's next.P.

We still need to remember that it's a marvel movie. Russo brothers, great crew, and an all star of a cast. It's still a good movie, just not nearly as good as Endgame, infinity war, Ragnarok, etc. The design and special effects were A+. The story and buildup was a little slow/confusing at times tho. Especially, the flashbacks, but besides that, good movie with some great action.",Eternals

I dragged him to all of them and he went because he loves me; still he fell asleep in them. With the release of Shang Chi and the Externals, he stayed awake. The introduction of story telling and character building is a new direction for Marvel. This is what probably irritates most true fans. The road to change is and will always be a difficult one. I think this what most people need to remember when reading the 1- stars reviews.",Eternals

773,jakevoth,People Seem To Forget This Is A Superhero Movie...,9,5 November 2021,"... critiquing it for lacking in some way. Folks! We should rejoice that these movies aren't just Bruckhiemer blast fests full of hairy-chested one-liners. The fact this SUPERHERO MOVIE is getting bashed like it was supposed to be the next Scorsese is a testament both to the Marvel Hype Engine (please leave my Instagram alone Marvel. I get it. Your movie's out.) and to the actual greatness of this movie.Having to give critique I'd say maybe chill out with all the posing; standing like that in real life all the time would certainly lead to chronic back trouble, even eternally-speaking. And I wanna say it was rushed but that can't be in a movie so long...But I mean c'mon people. This movie was huge and it was small. Poignant and refreshing. I've never seen Zhao's other work but this is very obviously DIFFERENT in the way that James Gunn's Guardians were/are DIFFERENT. Something in the way. The tapestry of it. The tactility of the movie, if you feel me. And yes, It told an amazing story but just as importantly for the MCU, it'll be a basis for all the future stories.I hope all y'all's BS'n don't ruin Chloe's chances at a comeback: I for one, am STOKED for the next Eternals and THE BLACK KNIGHT.",Eternals

I saw a lot of bad comments before I watched the movie so my expectations were already a bit lower. But I still think that Chloé did an amazing job in figuring out te possibilities to introduce 10 new characters without making a mess. I think she gave us enough time to get emotional attached to the Eternals in the movie. The action and special effects in the movie were amazing and well organized. I do think that some things were out of place but overall, it wasn't a bad movie.",Eternals
775,yhmgvbek,Loved every second of it!,10,4 November 2021,"...and it's a lot of seconds, since this movie is 152 minutes long. Which, admittedly, is a lot and sometimes it gets a bit slow, but there was literally no other way to introduce these characters. It would have always needed a lot of explanation to introduce the Eternals, but Chloé Zhao somehow managed to make it a good package overall. Just one hour into the film it felt like we've had these characters for years, all of them with their own personalities, quirks, wants and needs.With an emotional twist that - apparently- no one really saw coming, this movie quickly went up my personal list of favorite marvel movies.",Eternals

Can't wait to see it on the home theatre. Directing, story telling and pacing were amazing. Kept grabbing my wife's hand throughout, and had to consciously release my fingers. I was curious how Angelina Jolie would do, and she brings everything home with Thena bringing balance with vulnerability of the ultimate warrior,looking forward to her appearances. I cared about all of the characters with their flaws, which made it seem all the more clear, they were a part of humanity, imprinted by those they were watching.",Eternals

It was very rough to get through and DEFINITELY shouldn't be 2h40m this movie could be 2 hours and wouldn't change much except for better pacing, i kept checking the time because at time i just wanted it to be done . If you're a marvel fan i would just recommend waiting for it to get on Disney plus or if you can get cheap tickets. Fight scenes were very marvel, interpret that as you will. It wasn't complete horrible as the final fight was very fun to watch, Gilgamesh and Kingo were very funny and i loved every scene they were in.

781,a-69008,Recommend,10,5 November 2021,"No spoilers. Although it is about gods, the theme is human nature, and the most prominent is love. Zhao Ting tried to talk about all the cross-sections of human nature. In addition, there were too many characters. Everyone had to stand up (giving everyone a shining point), and various myths and legends should be involved to push the plot forward (the plot is in the comics). There are enough reversals in the Wei Universe), and pave the way for the future of the Marvel Universe. The amount of information is huge, and Zhao Ting also took pictures of it very beautifully. So it feels to me that the pace is very fast. It seems that I only watched it for 1 and a half hours in 2 and a half hours. And there are laughs and tears. Unfortunately, the space for the director to play is limited. Marvel may not be the best, but it is likely that Zhao Ting is the worst. Thinking of it, a sentence can be used at the end of the plot ""when given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind""",Eternals

The characters and their motivations are different from the traditional Marvel heroes and their stories are complicated, enormous and magnificent. The end opens a lot of new pathways for the Marvel Universe but the fact is that you understand that you are watching a MCU movie only when you see the post-credit scenes... I think that Eternals is much bigger and deeper than many other products of this Universe and it wants to tell us so many things. This is the kind of movie that you either love or hate.",Eternals

789,simonalterator,Yikes...,5,5 November 2021,"I've enjoyed the marvel cinematic stuff. I'm no super fan or anything but they've been fun. This wasn't an enjoyable entry for me unfortunately. I really liked Zhao's Nomadland last year and Nanjiani has consistently been a highlight in his other work, so I went in with some expectations, but not many.What worked:
1. Some great cinematography, lighting choices and environments were gorgeous.2. Costumes when the cast are in their human clothes, they all have distinct and interesting style choices.3. Some moments of enjoyable performances. Harrington and McHugh were standouts.What didn't:
1. Many performances fell flat, but I feel like the CG might be partially to blame. Multiple times Chan delivered a very flat 'run!', but it was delivered just as the CG baddie was already chomping down?2. Some CG was poorly tracked which was very distracting.3. Script and narrative structure dragged. By the third soap-opera-esque monologue about love the guy next to me in the theatre was huffing. Relied on lots of weird tropes like 'the baddies were trapped in the last ice age and now they're thawing out'. Giving me flashbacks to Transformers. I refuse to believe locating things in ice would have been an obstacle for super-advanced beings.4. The 'super hero' costumes were very rubbery looking. When the actors were crouching or raising an arm there were big flubby sections of their costumes sliding around and buckling. Considering how good the similar costumes looked in an entry like Captain Marvel, this was confusing and distracting.",Eternals
790,marionlajara,Not as bad as people make it out to be.,10,5 November 2021,Overall the movie was not that bad compared to how bad Shang Chi. The story could've been better not trying to spoil anything but the deviants seemed like a side story the whole time. The movie had multiple additions to new characters to the MCU. It didn't play by the typical marvel rules and was definitely something different. Worth the watch and is definitely is over hated.,Eternals

The introduction to the characters, the action, and the story was spot on in the beginning. Act 2 was definitely a bit slower and was boring at times. However, it still contained interesting plotlines and still kept me entertained to a certain extent. Definitely the weakest act of the 3. Act 3 was not as exciting as it couldve been, but was still satisfactory and the action was great. Overall, the movie definitely has its flaws, and I can understand why some people think that the movie dragged, but for me, I really liked this movie.

Obviously no ones used to change.There was some aspects of this movie that definitely weren't amazing. I'm not 100% convinced on any of the characters (whether that's due to acting, who they chose to play each character, or how they wrote the story), I think there's potential. Kit Harrington (although we didn't see much of him) did a great job and I have a feeling he may be another actor Marvel nailed on the head with casting. I think they did Lia McHugh (sprite) dirty in the writing of the character, but there's room for improvement.The first half had me a bit disappointed, but as the story continued I actually really enjoyed the movie. It's no easy task introducing this many new characters and new elements in one movie. It is opening so many different movies to the point that it may be overwhelming.

It's actually above the average. The movie actually has quite good pacing as long as you are an actual Marvel fan and you are interesting in learning more about the history of the MCU and new stories in the universe.The fights are amazing and plentiful for a non Avengers movie although you would want more cause it is that good.The movie does have a big story to tell but Chloe Zhao does an amazing job of telling that story. The movie does cut back a little on the snappy one liners but it's still plenty funny, mostly because of karun i.e. Kingo's trusted assistant.It does have an open ending that leaves a lot of questions unanswered and the post credit scene just add more questions.",Eternals

I watched it today walking into it reading all the bad reviews and good ones, and when I sat down to watch it started off kinda slow and I was like ok that's why the reviews are not great.

Black widow was a great movie not as good as Thor Ragnarok but it was still a great movie, this is the same why!It is a Beautiful movie and the fight scenes are great, on top of that we got two credit scenes ( one mid credit and one end credit) that is really worth the wait and will probably lead up to an Eternals two!For whom even reads this review just give this movie a chance it's actually a really good one and you might like it!",Eternals

There are also some really jarring tonal shifts and some aspects that make it impossible to take anything in this movie seriously. For one, there are a bunch of needlessly confusing flashbacks. Also, the Big Bad looks like a Bionicle with a LEGO face, which is just too goofy to be scary. There's a lot more I could say, but I don't want to include spoilers.",Eternals
811,palaksingh-92266,Splendid and DEFINITELY worth a watch,8,5 November 2021,"Star Packed, Vivid, Diverse, Emotional and Plot HeavyThe movie is pretty great, beautiful visuals on point acting and a diverse cast, Manages to capture the agony and problems faced by the eternals and I think the casting team should definitely be given a raise considering how great the ensemble they have put together. Richard Madden's flying scenes seem so natural and I don't think anyone could play ikarus better he is probably a plus point of the movie. AJ is just beautiful and Thena is probably the most badass eternal. End credits set up the future of the MCU pretty well though I am not a fan of him (trying to keep it spoiler free) most would be pretty pleased with his casting. But it does feel a little slow at times and the repeated flashbacks don't help it but it does not hurt to watch and at no point do you feel that it's too long. Review bombing (due to LGBTQ rep) even before it's release has made every one lose interest from it and yes its not the conventional marvel movie with intense action but Chloe Zhao s vision can be seen through this film she has prefered to keep the movie more focused on the plot instead of the action not that the movie has bad action scenes. She has shown characters with more emotional depth and a plot that focuses on the human nature of the eternals rather than only action and comedic one liners in between fights. Another problem that some might feel with the movie is the lack of character development, well somewhat true because you don't feel the connect you should have felt with Ajak and Gilgamesh but I think that's because we have become accustomed to marvel series but in let's say Avengers (2012) we didn't know much about all the members of the the team until much later when they got their solo movies. We didn't know anything about black widow until this year. So I think we will get to know more about character s like Thena and Druig atleast in the next part (hopefully).",Eternals

813,CalmDefender-26043,"Moving Imagery, but has SOME clunky, distracting flaws",6,8 November 2021,"I liked the film a lot. The director really pushed the boundaries of what has been filmed in a Marvel film. Kudos to them on that, seriously.My main issues where mostly within issues in story logic and some questionable editing choices. I was pulled out of the story a few times because certain things within the story logic didn't make sense to me, especially with some of the choices the characters made. The editing didn't feel smooth at times, almost as if they were trying to cover up mistakes in filming or something ...It's a beautiful film with great visuals, but its flaws hurt my experience in enjoying the film.",Eternals

Well the film itself was a joke. It just felt like the whole film was done in a studio around green screen, which isn't a good sign.The effects were poor, the ending after nearly 3 hours was a let down. I could go on But I'm not wasting anymore time on this film. One of the only Marvel films I would never watch again 👎👎👎",Eternals

MCU gets a WHOLE LOT BIGGER.,Eternals

I loved the characters and how divers they are, i hope to see them again soon ans get to know how the story goes on.

818,crderodero,Ignore the critics,10,9 November 2021,"It is definitely a different film and with a different vision in this type of film. It is a movie that intentionally wants to be slow and dense.Don't listen to the critics, it's a very good movie. They forget that it is a presentation film and that basically you have to develop 10 characters in 2 h 30 min and that is very difficult.My recommendation is that you give yourself to the film completely and do not look for errors, just enjoy it.",Eternals
819,jqgnkdbbm,Can't understand the negative reviews,8,8 November 2021,"While Eternals is not my favorite MCU movie, it is definitely not the ""disaster"" the critics reviews make it out to be. It was a thoroughly enjoyable movie with gorgeous visuals.",Eternals
820,hog-13845,Different in a good way,10,4 November 2021,One thing this movie did extremly well was its diversity it all the characters that weren't typical even if they were had a diverse aspect to them they didnt rely heavily on sign language for the deaf character. The homosexual character was really well done. And even down to things like mental health was done well and authentic. We even had a good plot twist that wasn't seen coming until it did. Couldn't be happier with how it turned out and the end credit scenes were even better. Tried to keep it as spoiler free as possible. 😁,Eternals
821,wchrisgarcia,not that bad,9,7 November 2021,"As a pretentious cinephile, it's fun and harmless. I'm not sure why Eternals has faced such backlash, but it's not as bad as critics (who I usually agree with) make it out to seem.",Eternals
822,jalejandrogarcia,It soon falls short of the expectations that it itself puts forward,3,6 November 2021,"Eternal starts off with a really promising setting of events and characters with just the right degree mystery. But as Zhao tries to develop them it's soon falls short of expectations that it itself puts forward. The visuals of heroes and monsters but specially of the different locations, historic events and people are magnificently achieved and beautiful to behold. However there's not much more there and certainly not enough to save this delivery. The film soon gets too slow, too long, too filled, a little mixed up, and unbearably pretentious. Characters are just too many to convincingly develop but at trying, it sacrifices steady structure and spreads the tone all over the place. As the final act approaches characters and plot go completely adrift with something of a childish randomness hurry feeling to it. At the end it shows that what felt like a thought-thru promise of epicness never really knew where it was headed.",Eternals
823,amirnageh,Not at the same level of MCU movies we used to see,1,5 November 2021,"Visuals are great, the cast is also great and that's it for me.Eternals is a new addition to the MCU and especially after getting great movies in the last couple of years such as endgame, far from home and the newly-released chang-chi, we as fans were overhyped to see new heroes joining the MCU but the results were underwhelming ( at least for me ), why ?1. It has so many characters to be introduced in one movie which is quite complex for us to understand each one and the relationship between them.2. It's sooooo long and boring as we're watching these new characters that we're not used to3. It should've had more of that ""superhero"" feeling of other movies, this movie is different but not in a good way .. it has more focus on drama than action, the story is not that enjoyable, there are many scenes that had more time than it deserved which makes it quite boring and dull.Overall, any superhero movie should always focus on what it really matters for being a superhero movie, not so many characters, clear ambitions for every character that really make sense, more action and intense, interesting story that fits the longevity of the movie, not focusing too much on drama, romance, politics, adult contents ( whether it's LGBTQ or not, sex scenes ) or any other aspect that is not a main aspect of superhero movies ( not only for eternals or mcu films but for all superhero movies ).",Eternals

I felt like I was in there for years, I loved the visuals and the 2 Indian guys were awesome too but the comedy in this movie was really dry, it had a stupidly long runtime and overall, I think this was the most boring marvel movie I've ever seen, probably the worst too.But, it's just my opinion, everyone has their own thoughts and I respect you all for them.",Eternals

828,stevenperkio,Short and simple review,3,5 November 2021,"Boring, boring, boring, and boring. Disney clearly took over this movie. Watch it and that will make much more sense. Too many unnecessary scenes and almost every single character isn't interesting. The ending and many parts throughout the movie were head scratching and at some points I even laughed. Not laughing in a good way. Anyone who gives this movie anything over a 6. Hasn't watched a marvel movie before. I said short and sweet. So I will stop talking now. If I do, I might talk myself into a lower score. 3/10 is a score I'm comfortable giving.",Eternals

832,gunnarmiller-47271,Big things lie ahead,10,6 November 2021,"I honestly have no idea why this film is being bashed. No clue. It has the action of course, comedy that works, character development that covers all characters, a LOT of emotions, and sets up so much to look forward to. The cast is phenomenal, they all work off of each other so well and that is good when it comes to a big cast. The stakes gradually rise as the true plot builds itself and all is revealed so by the time the 3rd act comes and all cards are on the table, you feel it all. The ending itself is something Marvel hasn't quite pulled before and it was quite nice, definitely sets up a huge plot element for the possible sequel.I won't say much about the end credit scenes, but I will say that they mean a lot in terms of expansion in the MCU and introduce key characters.You can tell that Marvel is changing its formula and it panned out very well here. This experience will definitely have audiences excited for No Way Home's experience.",Eternals
833,elljay-65247,Love the diversity but a lot of plot in one film,9,8 November 2021,I think this was one of the most visually stunning marvel movies. I love the diverse cast and representation was long overdue with marvel. Of course there has been representation within in the mcu before but not as much as this and never before has there been an openly gay couple. Personally I feel like some of the bad reviews are because of the representation and the fact that a white man is a villain. Of course this doesn't refer to every bad review. I feel like there was a lot of plot packed into one film and multiple conflicts going on at once. Overall I loved the movie and can't wait to see more of the eternals.,Eternals

836,beaumiller-53720,Peppa Pig is much better,4,7 November 2021,"I fell asleep twice, and then proceeded to walk out of the cinema. I was constantly aware of the acting, felt like I was at a middle school play and I was scared someone would mess up and forget the lines. Similarly, the jokes felt like they were written by a teacher who was targeting a young audience but really didn't know what would be funny.The story was forgettable, so forgettable that it did actually draw me to a deep slumber on one occasion. The second snooze was due to the boring unrelatable characters. Their boring dialogue drifted me in out of sleep. To be honest, some of the best sleep i've had in a while so i've added one onto the rating for that.The title, ""Eternals"" is actually very fitting. This film didn't seem to end. Even after falling asleep twice and spending half an hour contemplating my whole life choices I still had an hour left.The best part of the film was that Harry Styles is in the end credits. Sadly I had actually left the cinema at that point in search of a non life wasting experience.Please don't waste your precious time on earth watching this film. Peppa pig is much better.",Eternals

838,rohinthrana,Mcu redefined,9,5 November 2021,I love the movie. Before watching the movie I was wondering how a director would tell a story of 7000 thousand years but the director did a good job.the movie being slow paced is the fact that made me love because the story has to cover 7000 years and 10 eternals. The visuals are outstanding. The movie has redefined the future possibilities of the MCU and has awesome post credit scenes.,Eternals
839,bunky9t1,Absolutely twisty (not in a good way),5,3 November 2021,"I'm gonna keep this simple.Ajak is dead, betrayed and killed by Ikaris. ( I thought Druig was slightly malevolent, I was wrong).Intro about Eternals felt like Starwars at the beginning of the movie. The intro of their powers was all over the place. You don't even see what some of them are capable of. After all, their powers are melted into who they are as Eternals.No explanation about Celestials. Sersi freezes this Celestial on Earth and there was no mention that he is/was The Destroyer. They win and Harry Styles shows up as Starfox when Sersi, Phastos and Kingo taken by Areshim (and Starfox knows where Areshim had taken them to) in the post credit scene.Why would you introduce a new character when you have lacked the character building already?I yawned watching the movie and I have never, ever done that watching Marvel movie.Makkari was the best character with brilliant visual effects. You will experience it when she fights Ikaris as the end of the movie. THE BEST. The rest was just slow and boring to watch. Guardians of the Galaxy, when they introduced new characters with a ridiculous villain, was far better to watch. That movie was entertaining and fun.This movie was meant to be serious and crucial but lacked the serious story telling and pace.Oh, Gilgamesh dies to a strong deviant and he becomes the two legged deviant that fights Thena in the trailer. Thena cuts that deviant off in 2 seconds. That deviant meant to be super powerful sucking off from Eternals powers.It is absolutely messy story.",Eternals

The storytelling is incredible and easy to follow between time periods. The cinematography was stunning and definitely should be experienced in IMAX if possible. The bigger message of this film is definitely to love and care for our planet while we can, because it and the people on it, are special. The film had highs, lows, shocks and laughs which is exactly what I look for in an MCU movie and with the cliffhangers at the end, I can't wait to see the Eternals again in future projects.",Eternals

It has quite interesting start but why would but the eternals past memories plucked in the middle of the movie? It just doesn't fit into the film at all. And the characters also felt as forgettable as the story, most of them feel like they are artificial robots. And I actually felt happy that The guy commuted sucked just to easily forget him.But...

-2.5 hrs but still very little character development
-Story jumps around too much, kills the flow and still doesn't comfortably tie anything together.-If Druig isn't supposed to use his mind control power on humanity, but also never once even tries to use it on Deviants or Eternals...WHEN has he ever used it in the entire time that they've been on worlds? And how do they decide he can put a Celestial to sleep based on zero eveidence?-Why didn't Cerci go find a mouse or other small animal to try her powers on? If the entire planet is on the line, maybe try and see if you can do whaevidence?There are so many more examples...this film just didn't work, at all.",Eternals

I have to say that it's very different from any other MCU movie, but I loved that it went deep with topics that sometimes in this universe are dealt in a more ""shallow"" way. From the visual apparatus I have nothing to say; It's one of the most stunning movie of Marvel. It's just a movie that takes its time to unfold, so if you're looking for some fresh air in Marvel, this movie may be suitable for you.P.s. The chemistry between the characters is very well structured (helped by the amazing acting skills of the cast).P. P. S. Sorry for any typos or mistakes but english is not my mother tongue.",Eternals

I would have liked to see more than some characters but I thought the movie was good, not amazing or wonderful, just good, to hang out and enjoy a good story and good special and visual effects, yes, if you still do not see the movie stay until the end, that the two post-credit scenes are wonderful.

Chloé Zhao One of the best directors I've ever seen in Marvel.I was a little worried that she may not be able to show the Eternals as they were In comics but she did well.Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden The very awesome Richard Madden played the role in the best possible way, the relationship between thena and Gilgamesh was so emotional. Kumail Nanjiani and Harish Patel were just was hilarious I loved their characters and the acting was very good too. The characterization was perfect visuals were extraordinary writing was good (turns and twists, cliffhangers, and... emotional but in the meantime hilarious) action sequences was one of the best in MCU kind that we have never seen anything like it.

854,AltStreak,Doesn't deserve the bashing,8,6 November 2021,"I'll be honest, I had alot of expectations built for this movie for quiet some time and once i saw it for myself i personally don't think it deserves all of the bashing its receiving. One of the most mentioned problems being the slow pacing is quiet justified though, but even in the endgame we received that pace until the moment started to build up after most of the movie. Although it's definitely not on the same wavelength as Endgame, its not half bad as well.Cinematically it felt surreal but simultaneously quiet real, wonderful job on that. More the reason why it should definitely be viewed on the big screen. However I personally think that the point where the movie lacked was in the last half hour. The whole stopping the emerging scene couldn't quiet live up to the hype it built for us but again I think it's just a mere part of the story that's going to continue in the upcoming phase.To conclude this, I liked the movie. It was like a refresher from the prior movies we've scene. Still I'd say this again, doesn't deserve the heavily negative reviews it's receiving but again it's just my opinion. Solid 8 from me, -2 for the let down regarding the ending scenes.",Eternals
855,ArchitectNaut,Very Meh,6,8 November 2021,"Before writing this I read some of the reviews of other users and I am honestly happy some people really liked the movie. To me, it was a bit of a miss.In my opinion, great movies are the ones that, even if develop in a completely unrealistic universe, still have a firm grip on reality. Usually, I can 'forgive' unrealistic storylines for the sake of entertainment, but there is always a line; and this line is made very bold when events are happening on current day Earth. I think this movie didn't satisfy me because it crossed this line too many times.Spoilers Ahead!The whole storyline really had no stakes. You obviously know the Eternals must succeed against the emerging Celestial (even though I am left wondering what their plan was after succeeding as they went against orders from one of the strongest beings in the universe). I am guessing this is why they also incorporated the Deviants as a way to create a more tangible danger. However, they don't do anything to carry the story forward and the ending is so underwhelming. This sentiment of unreached potential is carried throughout the entire movie.The random appearance of the Deviants, while initially interesting, later looks like just a convenient way to get the Eternals back together for the bigger fight. The betrayal inside the group had no real impact on me as I didn't have time to know and get attached to the character.To me it felt like this storyline would have been better explored via a series. I understand series get a lot less commercial success but they tried to cram too much stuff in one single movie, so nothing gets the real exposition that it deserves. By the end of the movie I am left with some many questions; and not the good kinds. Why did the Celestial spare (for now) Earth. How did no one from Earth get notified of this huge figure-looking-thing literally coming out of the ground. Same thing with the first fight against the Deviant. Why do the Eternals need planets with a high population of intelligent life to emerge (I know it was briefly touched on but no where need enough for it being one of the main story elements). I have so many other questions that should have been answered in the movie.I remember leaving the theater thinking that, if it had been a DC movie, this would have been fine, but being a Marvel movie, it really missed the mark.Anyways, final verdict for me, I would go and watch it if you get the chance just in case future movies decide to get better and work off this storyline, but I wouldn't rush to the movie theater for it. You can easily watch this at home. Go watch Dune in theaters instead.",Eternals

We get to meet all of the eternals and see who they are, what they been trough and what they are fighting for. Troughout the film we experienced a beautiful and great time travel to the most important human history and ancient cultures where eternals have always been present. We also witness human mistakes and progress trough the eyes of the eternals.This film has everything from an interesting drama plot to stunnig action scenes with mindblowing visual effects from the celestials and deviants. The film do not deserve all the hate is receiving, it seems more that this hate it's againts a woman directing it, lgbt inclusion, diversity and originality from all the previous films.Just to be clear this film is not rotten at all, actually it is and should be one of the greatest marvel films to date.",Eternals

Thank you, Chloé Zhao, and Marvel Studios, for bringing us this masterpiece.It was fantastic! The film thinks outside the box by focusing on the characters' relationships rather than solely on action-packed set pieces and superfluous comedy. Eternals is undoubtedly one of my favorite MCU entries, beautifully directed, photographed, and performed.It creates legendary aspects that imitate the emotions of the characters.

859,kisbeni,Could have been more interesting but it was visually appealing,5,5 November 2021,"I think this film was way more hyped than it supposed to be, during the entire film I wasn't able to decide wether this film was a real time origin story and renunion or a normal action movie and I thing the love line was way too much for this. There could have been more action in it. The film brought more questions than answers and the answers were not statisfying for a fan. I know that this is the starter film for the 4th sequal but still.Overall it was long but an interesting film that made me think a bit but somehow it still attracted my interest to want to see the next movie about them.",Eternals
860,artistickingtito,AJAK & THENA,10,5 November 2021,I came to watch for Ajak and Thena and I was not disappointed. Salma Hayek played Ajak so well. Angelina Jolie executed Thena to perfection. The rest if the cast was phenomenal. I'm so proud of everyone involved in the making of this wonderful masterpiece.,Eternals
861,zymircouch,The Eternals are Great!!!,10,7 November 2021,"Honestly, I don't know how this movie could be less than a 6, I can understand if you think the pacing is slow and there was too little action, but for me it was paced well, the characters were great, the cinematography was great, everything was great! The only thing I would say is they could of use the deviant villain a little more but other than that it's a 9!!! Definitely top 10 marvel movie for me!! Oh, it's the most beautiful marvel movie imo!!!!",Eternals
862,rkbchoi,See it with open mind,9,3 November 2021,"I understand why there are bad review by critics and user. If you expect it is an avenger or related to any part of MCU up to endgame movie, you will be disappointed. Instead try to enjoy it with open mind just like the guardian of the galaxy 1. For many when guardian of the galaxy was out it was not related to any avenger when it come out. Marvel is trying hard to build phase 4, introducing new characters and it is hard to get everyone to love all 10 characters in 2.5hours. In the future I think they will connect the dots to another avenger type movie. Do stay for the 2 post credit scene.",Eternals

865,timmiez-08066,Overrated & not on par with expectations,4,3 November 2021,"The beginning of the movie was great, provide a clear insight & some relevance with previous endgame title, but everything went downwards & derailed soon after.One major issue, too many characters & most of the characters were not well developed, some characters are quite redundant & seems to be very awkward throughout the movie.Second major issue, we cant helped feeling the entire movie was pretty rushed & it seems like the script writer ran out of idea in continuing the story in a logical way, they attempted something very unexpected but however it ended up very disturbing & downright disgusting.Third major issue, very promising casts & crews but however not properly utilized, everyone seems to be very out of place & cant helped feeling the major leads were too scattered & unable to lead the audiences to follow the directions which they attempted.Conclusion, if this movie wasn't an avengers & marvel title, i would definitely not watch at all.My 4 stars rating goes entirely to the graphic & visual team who did a good job in making this mess slightly adaptable. Otherwise, i would not hesitate to give a 1 star rating if i could.",Eternals
866,boo_rox,A new era of the MCU,10,6 November 2021,"It's a lovingly written divulgence from Marvels usual formula and is all the better for it.

868,lantern-11086,Emotional and Epic,10,3 November 2021,Eternals changes everything! With a beautifully developed characters that take their own broken family relationships and the threat of the deviants. The Eternals may not be for everyone but this instantly one of my favorites mcu movies.,Eternals
869,janikbalazs,One-time movie,4,3 November 2021,"To be honest, this movie was definetely below my expectations. The visuals and CGIs are amazing and the fight scenes are fun to watch. However, all the other things are just template things and simply boring. The story is too slow, there are a lot of scenes that are not really needed. And the cast, they were horrible. Sometimes I felt like they have no emotions at all. A bunch of DC characters ordered from Wish.All in all, it is definitely a one-time movie and all Marvel fans need to see it. But only once in a life.",Eternals
870,adamwarlock-81037,Masterpiece,10,4 November 2021,I love the characters so much Kingo and Spirte are instant new favorites. The visuals are breathtaking much like Dr. Strange this movie is long but what a journey can't wait to see what's next.,Eternals

875,gabrielkiew,Better than critics say,7,4 November 2021,"Eternals turned out to be a visual master piece with a great story line. The film contained a good balance of action sequences, romance and humour, keeping me off my seat for the better part of 2.5hrs. At times, the film may suffer from too many characters, lacking much character development but makes up for it by being the most unique and different marvel film.",Eternals
876,krolakane,High expectations,2,6 November 2021,High expectations with this movie since the director of this movie had won an oscar for an amazing movie and with the trailer it made me want to watch it as soon as it came out. When I watched this movie oh wow I had a lot of bad stuff to say. This movie had amazing visual effects but throughout the movie it was so boring also it had slow pacing and alot of characters who did not have space to develop.,Eternals
877,junkmailalmog,flawed yet original and intresting movie,8,4 November 2021,"Without spoiling anything this movie has a lot of intresting characters an interesting dillema at its center and good effects and action. Some were angry at the ""forced diversity"" in this movie since it features people of several races. I am greatful for that not because i am a fan of diversity but because such different features helped me differentiate and remember the cast and since they introduce about 8 new main characters it was neccasary to have them be instantly recognizable.Some of the new characters are genuinely interesting rounded characters and some are forgettable side characters. The deviants showcased in the trailer are uninteresting and do not do much besides facilitating action scenes. The movie is a bit meandering in the middle but a higher dialogue quality than usual for marvel keeps it interesting.In the end i think this was an interesting experiment for marvel and i want to see where it goes from here.",Eternals
878,luisdiegocantu,Visually and Narratively Awesome,8,4 November 2021,"I have to say that this story took me on a different and enjoyable travel through time, human emotions and, definitely, breakable precepts. Beacuse of their characters motives and auras related to locations and photography, results visually astonishing. I strongly recomend to revisit this movie to catch every historical reference. There's someting new on Marvel's proposals and I like them.",Eternals
879,kabeysin,A faithful and resounding adaptation of Jack Kirby's strangest work.,10,5 November 2021,"Personally, I loved this movie and these characters. A true and faithful adaptation of one of Jack Kirby's more peculiar brainchildren, the Eternals. By no means was the film perfect, but I believe what Chloe Zhao managed to accomplish was nothing short of remarkable. With all of the themes that were presented and explored (morality, free will and self determination, the burden of immortality, etc), and with the sheer number of characters she introduced us to, it was truly an incredible feat. By far Marvel's most ambitious movie to date, crossover events notwithstanding, and certainly it's most beautiful, both visually and poetically. The invigorating score, the captivating cinematography, the gorgeous visuals, the heart-pounding action, the use of real-world natural settings wherever possible, and of course, the brilliant performances by the cast- all the very best the MCU has offered.Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, the story isn't perfect. There is more than one flaw, but ultimately, it can be boiled down to too much story, too little time. Why this was not a Disney+ show, I don't understand. Had all of the strengths of this movie been retained and the story was simply expanded upon without diminishing those qualities, this would've far surpassed any other Disney+ show to date. I only wish Marvel's top brass (yup I'm looking at you, Mr. Feige) had had the foresight to acknowledge that the task of introducing an audience to 10 new characters in a film, and expecting us to care for them, was simply a task too tall to handle, even in the hands of a capable Oscar winner. For what it was, and what it was given, this film was the best that it could be. I didn't find the plot to be convoluted as some have criticized, nor do I believe it was overly expository. In fact, it was in those moments of exposition that I found myself begging Marvel to dig deeper, to finally break through those seemingly immovable boundaries of the superhero genre and explore more mature, dramatic themes. Alas, I don't believe the time restraints of any feature length film would've afforded that opportunity.If Eternals did anything, it definitely showed us that Marvel is ready and willing to explore new themes; to break the mold; to rid themselves of that overbearingly repetitive formula. If Shang-Chi dipped its toe into new, fresh, and feel-different MCU waters, Eternals plunged its leg in. I hope this trend continues and eventually, they dive head first into the deep end. I honestly can't wait to meet these compellingly interesting characters again sometime soon. To say I'm excited about how this movie has expanded the Marvel universe to cosmic proportions would be a dramatic understatement. Outside of Infinity War, I haven't been more excited for an MCU sequel. I highly recommend watching this film, especially if you're a Marvel fan, but even more so if you're a Jack Kirby fan.",Eternals
880,img-63328,Bad,1,4 November 2021,"Idealistic in making something can be a good thing and it can also be a bad thing.marvel's idealism in this case is contrary to the majority of normal people in the world so that what we get is a bad result, we can't just ignore what Marvel wants to give in this film This will lead to future Marvel films or others who will openly show bad behavior, Hollywood films have now become a political realm, letting things like Marvel do in Eternals will make those who have an interest win.",Eternals
881,wheywood-24674,A great addition to the Marvel Universe,8,4 November 2021,"This is a really good movie. It's about 24hrs since I've seen it and I can't stop thinking about it. Without giving anything away this film does take on a lot and maybe would've benefited from being less. An edit of characters, plot twists and CGI may have taken a good film to a truly great film.But I enjoyed it. It was a visual feast in a movie that needed to please MCUers while attempting to reach for something more. And yet I think it did succeed in that - it is thought provoking while being a very entertaining flick.Is it the best Marvel movie ever, no. Does it have it's flaws, yes. Should that stop you from seeing it and enjoying it, no. Not in the least.I'm very much looking forward to E2 and where these characters go next.",Eternals
882,jaysondcooke,Eternals will outlive all negativity.,9,4 November 2021,"I have read that this film has no humour, but I and the cinema audience all laughed out load at every joke. I have read this film is lifeless, but every frame is a celebration of the history, versatility, and complexity of life. I found every character compelling, and loved the family(ish) dynamic being challenged by 7000 years together.",Eternals
883,xttt-31772,A Very Different Marvel Movie that Defies Expectations,10,4 November 2021,"After having watched all Marvel movies religiously from Iron Man 2008 to Shangchi. This finally brings a breath of fresh air. At times, it even reminds me a little of the Dark Knight Trilogy by Christopher Nolan. Of course they are very different movies, but both felt like a mature and thoughtful adventure that has ambition of being more than just a simple superhero recipe.Admittedly there are problems with pacing and character building. Thena being a particularly weak one for me, which may have been caused by my heightened expectations of Angelina Jolie's superhero debut.Right now, I think Marvel needs movies like this to move forward. Honestly, after the ultimate climax of End Game, can they really keep going with the old universe and same old formula? It has already started to get boring and way too bland. I didn't particularly enjoy Shangchi for this very reason. It was too familiar with only a thin layer of Asian skin and 'culture'.Overall, I think Eternals deserves to be seen and to be continued. It is only the first experiment. Hopefully future projects of similar scale and style will become more refined, and thus truly redefine the superhero genre.",Eternals
884,jwade-94531,I knew I would love this movie,10,4 November 2021,"From the second I stepped into the theatres to watch this movie I felt excited. The visuals for this movie are stunning. The costumes, the landscapes, the scale, the actors themselves - all stunning. What this movie does well, is introduces a new set of characters and makes you attached to them so by the end of the movie you are left biting your nails, as I was.It was such a refreshing movie and felt adventurous, unlike anything Marvel related. A new set of characters and cast, with plenty of plots and storylines to focus on going forward. What's not to love?",Eternals
885,rbnkmsmm,Very average. Just wait to see it on home release.,5,10 November 2021,"Echo the sentiments of what all other people that rated it in a similar vein to me have said. For some random superhero movie it was fine, but for the money Marvel pumps into these projects, it certainly missed the mark by a long shot. A 1/10 is a little harsh, the film is just very average for sure.The characters all felt very one dimensional, purely as a result of trying to establish too many backstories in the one film. I'd agree that they certainly wasted some of the characters.The action/combat scenes did feel like filler scenes. Yes you can argue this may have not been the purpose given the movies underlying objective in establishing new characters/a new story, but for casual/semi Marvel fans that go for the traditional Marvel blockbuster goodness, I'd wait to see it at home.Some of the acting was terrible at the beginning, it certainly got better as the story progressed, but they certainly have chosen to keep some of the less interesting characters around to move forward with.A lot of the writing was very cliché, even for a Marvel film, and Sprite in particular was incredibly obnoxious and not executed very well (for what should have been a powerful statement that they were attempting to make).The length of the film was good for what they were trying to fit in, but given that some of the content wasn't very good, and the movie had a relatively slow pace and simple storyline, they probably should have cut 30 minutes out.All of the references made to previous films and stories in the franchise were great, so that's a plus, any hardcore Marvel fan will enjoy this film.",Eternals
886,carlakuester,Beautiful opening for Phase 4,9,4 November 2021,"The movie is definitely different from other MCU films, due to less action sequences and a lot more story building and cinematography (landscaping was amazing). I don't really mind that because it is necessary to introduce us to a lot of new characters and further movies.What I find refreshing is the diversity. The eternals are supposed to save the entire world, not just the USA so it makes sense that it represents the population of our entire planet, not just that of Northern America and (Western) Europe.",Eternals

The characters and writing was superb and was wonderfullt emotional and intimate. It didn't feel like an MCU movie and guess what... THATS A GOOD THING! They're trying something new and that's what we want. The movie is quite long but the length is needed for introducing 10 new unique characters with their own motivations and also the story of the celestials. The action is great and intense, the story feels dark and more mature then we are used to, the acting is phenomenal and overall was a solid film not just a solid MCU film. Ignore the bad reviews and watch it yourself and make an opinion, it won't be a movie for all viewers but it is definitely not a bad film!",Eternals

Coupled with equality and taking us to a part of the marvel comics i was not to familiar with, I loved this movie. I came away from this feeling like I knew who everyone was, which I did not expect was possible for such a big cast in this genre. The exposition was the subtlest I've seen from Marvel, and the overall plot was complex enough to still be very clear. For once I didn't have to Google anything afterwards (except for the mid & post credits stuff).",Eternals

894,lorenzocaraussao,Those people are blind,10,4 November 2021,"I think all the people who have given negative ratings don't know what a good movie is, and they don't know how to analyze a movie. They just rely on the fact that it was long with few action scenes. Indeed ,this is the first Marvel film not suitable for children, because to be able to understand the film, you need to have a slightly more open mind since the film focuses a lot on the psychological characterization of the characters. This film is much more complete than the others because it has a beginning, a development and an end, it tells a story of its own. It has dramatic parts that meke you move, and there is no longer the usual comedy of the previous marvel films, in short , it is no longer a film suitable for an audience of children and people who do not know about cinema. So it's normal in the end that it has all these negative evaluations, but it is sad.-italian guy.",Eternals

896,ajanderson2,Amazing visuals and philosophical concepts!,10,4 November 2021,"Not only is the Eternals a visual masterpiece, the inner challenges each of the eternals face is a great signifier of the MCU moving into a more mature, meaningful phase.When you look deeper into the plot and each events significance, and appreciate the detail put into a timeline that spans thousands of years, the low underwhelming ratings seem obviously out of place. And despite the fact that many people loved the MCU as a couple of buff guys and over-sexualised women, the transition the MCU is going through is inevitable, as a franchise that has supported generations, and quite frankly awesome.Besides from the stunning visuals and deep undertones Chloe Zhao certainly packs in enough fight scenes as possibly needed. Each eternal represents a unique power, connected through their source of cosmic energy. This variability allows for exhilarating fight scenes that are arguably more interesting than a couple of punches, kicks and the stray flying weapon. The love stories are quaint and meaningful, and certainly don't take up too much of the run time.Overall, the new age of maturity and deeper concepts seen in this movie is most definitely something to look forward to in Phase 4!",Eternals

The cause of their existence and how it is explained throughout the movie!It was really interesting at the beginning and those visuals were great.However , the main characters didn't develop as much as I want to! I didn't get the feeling like the other Marvel movies. Not to mention Cerci was nothing special as a character.The relationship of the main characters wasn't developed too.-I love you Icarus
-I love you Cerci
And that was it! No feelings nothing!The Chinese guy died and Angelina didn't even cared lol 😂
Moreover , they were fighting those creatures all movie and in the end only one appeared and i wasn't really hyped about the fight.To sum up , they could have done a much better job and this movie has a lot of potential!I would like to watch the second one and I hope they will fill the gap holes from this movie.",Eternals

Even Thor the Dark World beats the pacing of this movie. Never have I seen a bigger waste of a great cast. Looking for a good mid credit scene? Nah it only reassures you that this movie is garbage. I'm a die hard Marvel fan and this is making me question every future marvel movie after Endgame. I get that some people may like this movie but they are probably below the age of 6. Anybody older will be bored to death and will be facepalming their entire way through this movie. Please Marvel remember what made you fun to watch. Not some deep boring story directed with no artistic flare but an action movie with super powers. The only super power in this movie is super boredom.

908,tharuth-20482,Great Movie Until Climax,9,5 November 2021,"The Eternals Impression: (9/10) - ignoring the climaxOkay this is a really strong movie **at first**. The characters are great for Marvel characters, nothing seems forced (albeit admittedly a bit rushed when introducing them). The action and effects are absolutely top-tier and the humour isn't forced and legitimately hilarious in it's execution (IMO).The lore building and character building for Icaris and Sersi are pretty well done too (at first), and I think the reasons for not intervening in human history and getting into spoiler territory, SPOILER Ajak's reading for wanting to save them SPOILER.Skipping over the meat and potatoes, the movie is legitimately great (IMO) until the climax. The climax is awful in writing and completely shits on a so far well written character. The climax is legit like a 2-3 for me, not unwatchable, but definitely will ruin the movie for a good chunk of people, and then followed up by the aftermath which is even worse/more stupid, it's horribly written.The ending is at least good/great and both the mid-credit and post-credit scenes are pretty interesting, introduces two significant (at least I think so, given who one of them is) additions to the MCU.

Throughout the movie I was in absolute ""aw"" over the stunning visuals and the story telling. The cast really brought this movie together, you would think with this many ""main characters"" they couldn't tell a story for all of them, but that's were your wrong. During the movie you learn to love these characters, feel their emotions and feel what they are going through. Only thing that I criticize the movie about is pacing could have been a bit better but that's really it. Walking out of the theater, I knew that this movie was now one of my top favorite marvel movies! Hats off to the people that worked on this movie y'all did amazing.",Eternals

I think this is the weakest script writing (and directing) for a Marvel movie that I've watched, which is sad when you have such a stacked cast. Some lines were just jarring and weird, and pockets where I thought to myself, ""uh... okay"". I think it need not dragged on for two hours plus, or it needs to have better ""build up"" scenes.

913,szmark-02693,Amazing movie :) from a non-marvel fan.,9,5 November 2021,"The movie is actually very good. Good story and good cast. It is something different what people expected so no superman, no iron man and no wonder woman and other bullshits.ON the big screen it looked stunning NOT CGI and green box feelings at all.THe whole movie looked so real and natural.. The jokes were ok also.By the part of Areshim and the baby gods ... i was schocked.I give 9 point because it was so brave and unique with lot of knowledge and work and of course Angelina Jolie.

Every design of the characters, creatures, environments and the entire movie is beautiful!The feeling is that we are seeing an epic and unforgettable film, supported by the excellent soundtrack. In addition to editing, making the film flow very well, even making some temporal frills, as they lived many of our stories from the past.Chloé Zhao's direction is off the curve, but it becomes subjective, because there will be a lot of people who won't like it because it's not like other Marvel movies, but it has all the little points that Marvel has: lightness, great action, great special effects and good comedy.Ah! I would like to leave my satisfaction with the script. For those who know the Eternals comics, they will see some differences and this can affect their experiences. But I loved it! I really enjoyed the unfolding of the story, I really liked the outlines of each character, their personalities and attitudes.Briefly, I loved it! I left the cinema super thoughtful and excited to see them again! Really enjoyed! It's in my Top5 for sure! By the way, the movie has two scenes after credits! Extremely curious for the future of Marvel movies!",Eternals

The story, as we have unfortunately have come to expect from recent MCU entries, is sacrificed in order to fit as many heroic team-up shots and action scenes in as possible. However, the fantastic concept still makes for an enjoyable, although rough around the edges, plot. The acting really manages to elevate the story though, the entire cast is amazing.",Eternals
920,srinath-37558,SPOILERS FREE REVIEW,10,5 November 2021,Totally different mcu movie and the deviants are very scary to watch . A bit slow in the middle when explaining about their past but it was superb in overall with all sides being covered in the movie . And the mcu will totally change after this movie.,Eternals
921,lorenzomagtibay,I did not like Eternals,1,5 November 2021,"POSITIVE:Cinematography is dopeSpecial effects are dopeKumail Nanjiani's character is charismaticI love the way they show Ikaris, Sprite, Gilgamesh and Makari use their powers.NEGATIVES:I cannot relate to any of the charactersPlot is a mess and sometimes does not make any senseSersi, Ikarus, Druig and Makari are so one dimensional.It's full of talking in the 2nd act. And I can't even hear them fully talk because the background music was distracting.I feel like Phastos being LGBTQ and Makari being handicapped is just there for the sake of being there. There are just your typical token black people, especially Makari. Like, ""Hey look I'm black and LGBTQ and hey look! I'm back and deaf! I'm in this movie but nothing is done with me, I'm just here because of representation."" There is potential in her to make a good compelling story but Marvel missed the mark.Sersi and Ikarus' storyline is very uninteresting. Like,if you take out their romance storyline it will not affect the main plot in any way.There is this storyline with Thena and Gilgamesh but it is cut off quickly and the payoff was meh. Gilgamesh is like Makari, he has a potential to tell a good story but his character was just wasted.I hate the way they show Sersi, Phastos and druig use their powers. So lame.Deviants are just disposableMarvel stepped up before giving us empathic villains such as Killmonger, Thanos, Vulture, Mysterio and Wen Wu, but unfortunately in Eternals you don't know the villain's perspective of why he is doing the things he is doing, of why he is evil.I don't feel like they re authentically a team. I mean compared to Guardians of the Galaxy, in their first movie,we know and is convinced that the Guardians are now a team,a family. In the Eternals I don't get that.CHARACTER RATING FROM BEST TO WORSE:Kingo - 5 starsGilgamesh - 4.2 starsSprite - 3.9 starsMakari - 3.2 starsThena - 3 starsPhastos - 3 starsAjak - 2.9 starsDruig - 2.5 starsIkaris - 2.2 starsSersi - 2.1 starsWHAT I WISH ETERNALS COULD HAVE BEEN:I wished it could have been more like Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians Of the GalaxyEternals feels more like Josh Trank's Fantastic Four or X-men :Dark PhoenixLast note:""Content precedes design.

It was a dull movie nothing great and not too bad but i think its now worth watching in theatres. There are only 3 movies i regret watching in theater Captain Marvel ,Antman 2, spiderman homecoming and now this.

925,archis-12852,Would've been better as a duology,7,5 November 2021,"The film is good. The visuals are stunning, the storylline is okay and continues the trend of expanding the Marvel universe. However, it does feel like a duology crammed into one film with a LOT of exposition. The trailer gave the impression of doing a good job balancing the past of the eternals and the present but the execution lacked soul. It lacked the energy of an avengers level, star studded, big budget CGI type movie, however the third act did a good job with that. While the threat seemed very real and magnanimous, it lacked in engaging the audience as much as i had hoped. The biggest let down is the underutilisation of the use of powers. It really feels like even the Avengers could defeat them whereas in reality they are far more powerful. Here's a quick spoiler-free rundown of the plus points and down points of the characters:
Madden's Ikaris is powerful and it shows, however his full potential is not really explored. And yes, Superman from DC would easily defeat him, no cap.Jolie's Thena and Dong-Seok's Gilgamesh have really engaging action sequences but lacks the soul of an Eternal.Chan's Sersei has been executed really well where her true potential is explored throughout the film.Henry's Phastos' real potential is explored and is a treat to watch.Hayek's Ajak is a let down.McHugh's Sprite takes you through an emotional journey and has been executed pretty well.Ridloff's Marraki steals the show when she appears and is really powerful.Nanjiani's Kingo is a well executed character who also serves as a comic relief along with Patel's Karun but is a let down in the third act.Keoghan's Druig is by far my favourite character in the movie. Although he is no match for most of the characters in combat scenario, he is a really well executed character and will make you root for him.",Eternals
926,peteroheight,"Scope, Scale, and 4 Huge Character Reveals...",8,5 November 2021,"The supposed hate for this film has to be chalked up to a whole lot of ""special interest"" twits who hadn't even seen it yet. This was a beautiful epic from the Celestial opening, to the closing, off-screen dialogue.This. Film. Is. Grand! Any doubt as to whether the scale would feel enormous enough was crushed in moments and rode through the entire movie. You're faced with the very human flaws of godlike characters, that don't stray from being fragile, even while leveling landscapes. Power resonates in every aspect, but it's the nuanced performances that standout (huge props to Don Lee and Bryan Tyree Henry, specifically who supply steadfast heart throughout). Two and a half hours went by like a blip, with only minor notes given for a couple pacing issues, but pushing an ensemble cast that large has its hurdles. For the first time in a while the injection of humour doesn't seem forced, or childlike, in an MCU film, which rests squarely of the jacked shoulders of Kumail Nanjiani and the brilliantly human Harish Patel!Eternals hits like new mythology, and doesn't back off with gigantic reveals for the MCU, as well as offhanded resettings of the status quo. Put simply: Chloé Zhao gave you an epic, minus a few minor stumbles, that is undeniably beautiful, and will remind you what it means to feel small.",Eternals

928,farihinwn,Beautiful cinematography,10,5 November 2021,"Sure it has it flaws, but it's far from the worse MCU movie or a 'disaster'. Cinematography and action are definitely some of the best in MCU. I really enjoyed the movie and i don't find the flashback scenes confusing. The story of each characters are also very interesting to me. Really nice to see the MCU expands in this direction. So many stories going forward on a different scale. I hope they get to explore this side of the universe more in the future!",Eternals

931,sauviksaha-55300,An immersive movie and a visual masterpiece!,8,5 November 2021,"The movie was well-paced throughout its 157 min runtime. Visuals were just absolutely stunning and the cinematography felt fresh; but most importantly, the character build-ups were excellent along with a decent plot. I was looking forward to see how Chloé Zhao would handle the introduction of so many new characters in a single movie and I must say, she did a brilliant job. The movie, in its core, had a grand scale but still managed to keep the characters so grounded and emotionally relatable. It had everything from emotional and moral conflicts, to breathtaking visuals, humor, pleasant surprises, and strong antagonists. Without giving too much away, let's just say that the antagonists in this movie had compelling reasons for what they were doing. They had a grey moral compass (something a little bit similar to what made people love the character of ""Thanos"") and this is what made the plot so strong and emotionally engaging.Let's wrap up by saying that it is one of those movies where the critic scores mean absolutely nothing! (I could go on and keep asking questions about the credibility of these ""so-called critics"" but frankly, I don't care and neither should you.)Go watch the movie (preferably in IMAX 3D) and make your own opinion out of it. This is a good, if not the best, movie in the MCU franchise. It is a MARVEL movie; but it's so much more than that. :)",Eternals

The problem isn't the typicall, and the problem isn't just a generall villian who just want to destroy the heroes. The moral question they have about their purpose is great. The only think that did not like me is that with that amount of characters are some who do not have enough time in the screen. Druig, Makkari, Phastos and Thena were my favorites.",Eternals

The characters and visuals/designs were top notch. Pacing and overall storytelling could've been better, but I really really enjoyed it. It's just different. It's especially different from Marvel's usual. I like different, in fact, this is probably in the top 10 Marvel movies for me and I love Marvel. The cinematography is just really stunning throughout the movie and the characters were lovable, interesting, and made up most of the movie.Go watch it for yourself and make up your own mind though. Some people will enjoy it, some people won't like it. The few that hate it because of diversity and the people they chose to represent in it are childish and pathetic. It's honestly not bad and I would rate it at the top for people like me who likes visuals and characters and longer movies!!!",Eternals

Every Charcter is Explored in a Dramatic Way and we will own the characters. Ofcourse the slow paced narration lead to some lags but it's definitely worth it. Unlike other Marvel Films, Eternals surely had different approach but the signature of Marvel Studios didn't scatter away...It had all elements that every marvel movie has. And the Performances are Strong and Astonishing. The Twists and Turns are the amazing parts in the film as they push the movie further.

939,frenchevan,"It was a movie, that's for sure.",3,7 November 2021,"I'm going to steer away from spoilers in this review. I saw Eternals on opening night, and as much as the cinematic scenes and beautifully choreographed fight sequences caught my attention; sometimes it was monotonous. Long boring cinematic shots took most of the movie's screen time. Marvel incorporating mixed ethnicities for their characters, which was awesome to see and each character did what they were written too, but each character also felt stock. Very few of the eternals actually had some sort of change to their change and overall each of them felt round and cliché. The storyline was what can be expected from a Marvel movie, it was nothing special. The plot was rough and choppy and every event that was supposed to progress the movie on felt blunt and forced, as if the director spent too much time filming the sunset and quickly wrote in moving plot points; it felt like a shopping list.As a Marvel fan, I'd say go and see it. I'm sure that it will captivate fans during the film, but it won't wow most of them.",Eternals
940,tptbbhvt,Made an account just to say how bad this movie is.,1,6 November 2021,"AWFUL. Marvel doesn't handle super powered heroes well. This felt like their inhumans endeavor and I am hoping that they write this out of canon too. Zero character development. They wanted to be Avengers and Justice League and all we got was like some Netflix B version of both combined.Totally disappointed because Loki and What If set this phase 4 up so well and somehow we got this mess. They spend too much time in the past. I'm still not sure who the villain was.Also a cataclysmic event like the end of the world would have surely got the attention of captain marvel or the Avengers. Not this b squad. They spent so much time trying to make it connect and the character name drops of the other movies were so misplaced and forced. Almost like it was a different movie and Marvel made them do reshoots to include them.I don't recommend that you see this. Shang Chi was great. This stunk so bad that they need to just cut their losses, leave it self contained and just pretend it never happened. Honestly this movie could sink the entire marvel universe.",Eternals

The characters felt distinct, plot relatively easy to follow, and it introduced new concepts without inducing a headache.Visuals were also stunning, and most humor felt natural to the dialogue and most landed with me, although they didn't make me laugh out loud, it made me smile and induced chuckles amongst my crowd.Biggest cons were pacing issues, mostly with repeated information and a bit too many flashback sequences that broke the flow at times. Another big con was that the two leads, sersi and ikaris, lacked chemistry. It didn't feel like they were in love for 5000 years, so the ending felt contrived and unnatural.Other than that though, I find this a solid addition to the mcu.",Eternals

I have watched all the Marvel movies, both in cinema and out, and this stands up there with the best of them because it has heart whilst not taking itself too seriously (you can get some pretty solid nods to DC, Dragon Ball and a few other universes). Seasoned actors stand side by side with new talent and everyone gets their spot in the light. A special shout out to Lauren Ridloff (Makkari) and Don Lee (Gilgamesh) who stole the show through their characters, acting and great relationships with other actors/characters. How Ridloff can do more with a glance or look than others can with a whole page of dialogue shows off her talent.The only downside is that the film leaves you with a lot of questions, but that is because it is kicking off a brand new era for the MCU so is leaving a lot open. Honestly, I have no idea how they are going to bring together cosmic beings with mult-dimensionsonal rifts, but I am in for the ride.Watch it, enjoy it, and imagine what comes next.",Eternals

953,brotherluj,The storyline progresses too slowly,5,6 November 2021,"For parents, I highly recommend reading a review or at least previewing the movie first to assess if this movie is appropriate for your kiddos.The movie itself has too many flashbacks... most/all are to help the viewer see the emotional development of the 'Eternals.' The movie itself starts as a flashback, goes to present day, Eternals realize there's a world threat, flashback, go visit other Eternals, flashback, go collect another Eternal, flashback, present day, flashback, world threat is getting worse, flashback, Eternals assembled, flashback, go fight big bad threat, end credit scenes. The movie feels slow, because the actual story line doesn't really progress... it should be summed up, 1. Here are the Eternals, 2. There's a world threat, assemble Eternals, 3. Fight world threat, 4. End credit scenes.Problems with the movie itself:
1. Too many holes in the story line... like, where were all the Eternals during Thanos's snap?2. End credits scene CGI was horrible.3. Many unnecessary things in the movie.

960,dcloye-24908,De gustibus non est disputandum.,1,6 November 2021,"For me, this movie made me cringe so often it felt like an attack of epilepsy.What I like about every other Marvel movie is the continuity and how well all the pieces add up to a bigger and better story. This festering turd has no internal logic and haphazardly introduces many truly elements that are supposed to ""play out"" through Phase 4 in perhaps the stupidest ways possible.There are two main themes you might find in this mess of a movie:
""Are we safer and/or happier remembering the past?""
and
""Is humanity worth saving""
The MCU answers to those questions would make for a far far better story if this movie could be completely forgotten.",Eternals
961,amirfs-60609,Fantastic storytelling and a great sensory experience.,10,6 November 2021,"Eternals was simply awesome. I left the theatre wanting more. It's a must-watch.Zhao's direction and Djawadi's music together created something magical, something unlike any Marvel movie before it.The representation, which I feared would be forced or flat, felt so natural and fitting for the story being told. It was refreshing. I'd honestly give it a 9.5/10. I wish we had a full-length 3 hour piece (like Endgame) which would have allowed the final third to play out at a better pace. I'd love to watch the developed director's cut if it ever came out.I'm glad I was excited and pumped for this movie and managed to ignore all the critics (most of which doesn't even make sense now) and the review-bombing.",Eternals
962,centerd,It felt like a summarized version of a TV series,5,6 November 2021,"This movie has two main challenges that it needs to overcome: introducing a brand new cast of main characters and setting them within the context of the MCU's Post-Endgame era. The last MCU movie that had to deal with similar challenges was Guardians of The Galaxy. However, while GOTG only had to introduce 5 main characters, The Eternals has to introduce 6-10 (depending on how many of the Eternals you consider to be part of the central team). Moreover, while GOTG could avoid most of the existing MCU context (post Avengers 1) because its setting was in deep space, The Eternals takes place on Earth and must address the recent MCU events. Overcoming these two challenges in a satisfying way for the viewers is incredibly difficult, so I have some sympathy for director Chloe Zhao for how lackluster this movie felt. What annoys me is that The Eternals wants to do so much more while already having a pretty full plate.The first half felt like a collection of key scenes taken from a 10-episodes TV series. A TV episode can build a connected and complete mini-story in 45-60 minutes on 1 or 2 characters and their relationships with the world around them. This allows a TV show to flesh out more, if not all, of its main characters. A movie does not have such luxury, so the typical solution is to focus on only a few characters and leave the rest with some surface-level development. But this movie isn't willing to sacrifice, choosing instead to give each Eternal a personal conflict to overcome. This results in none of the characters having enough screentime to properly go through their arc and allowing viewers to be invested in them. Like watching only the introductions and highlights of a TV show, you may find the scenes interesting, but they don't deliver any major impacts. Combining this with the movie's frequent switching between past and present and you get a jarring, frustrating, and eventually boring experience. The second half does have some interesting revelations and resolutions, but by that point I'm only watching to see how the MCU will be expanded and not to see how the characters can overcome adversities anymore.I'm kinda sad about how this movie turns out, as I had hope that it wasn't as bad as critics have said. And to be fair, the movie tries to tackle many interesting ideas: dementia, sacrifice some for the sake of many, duty vs. Love, allowing people to make their own choices vs. Living their lives for them, and more. But it got too ambitious while disregarding its limitations and, like Icarus, fell into the ground. So in this one case, I agree with the critics--this movie is a 5 for me.On a side note, this movie has the best visual effects out of all MCU movies. From the technogies of the Eternals to the appearance of the Celestials, it all looks incredible and outer-worldly. With the MCU expanding to the realms of cosmic entities and the multiverse, I look forward to what spectaculars are awaiting (looking at you, Dr. Strange).",Eternals
963,kadhirl,MCU without its fundamental aspect,2,6 November 2021,"When they said this movie is unlike any other Marvel movie, I was like ""Sure, I can accept different"", but after seeing the movie I understood what it actually meant. It lacked one fundamental thing that all other MCU movies (and even superhero movies in general) had in the past - ""Characterization"". It had the potential to truly break new grounds in comic book storytelling but instead got crushed under the weight of the inter connected nature of MCU. Should have been a dualogy or a Disney+ mini series. Apart from the spectacular visual presentation, this shockingly dull and uninspired tale of immortal beings coming together to save the world is a least interesting version of the Justice League and Avengers movies.",Eternals
964,nnqrdggb,"Risk taken, but definitely a great addition to the MCU",10,6 November 2021,"Before this movie was released, people were already slamming and critiquing Eternals, without any knowledge about this movie, its plot and the background of the characters played. The bad ratings came, not surprisingly, from people who thought characters with a diverse profile shouldn't be portraited as such. Which is a shame, cause I was really looking forward to this movie.After seeing it, I can say without a doubt that this is one of the best Phase 4 films so far. The dialogue between the actors was powerful and often times gave me a smile. Some people might say it was dragging, but hey, it's not an 'Avengers' film with non stop action. Chloé Zhao took a huge risk with the storytelling, different key elements, the intimate scenes and the different actors, but honestly, I loved every single minute of it.The two post credit scenes give the future of the MCU a lot of potential. Kit Harington as a potential Black Knight and, with Harry Styles playing Eros, a logical link to the next Thor or GOTG movie. Excited for what's coming next!",Eternals

No plot and awful script which made decent actors seem terrible. (With the exception of Salma Hayek, who was good) The characters were of no substance. Of course they whole movie was dictated by the current woke situation and meant that each token minority was crammed in there without a thought. Sad times indeed.",Eternals

I feel like they were set up to fail, the film had promise phase four excited me until now. However, I do not believe the following films will be as bad if they change director and seriously boost some more comedy and down to earth acting they earned in previous films.Stupid pointless plots with random cut scenes and not enough action. Lacked character drive and decent acting, big cast but lacked the punch.",Eternals
968,borisyusufov,Might not be for everyone but it was right up my alley!,10,6 November 2021,"Eternals is Epic!Stan Lee believed that comics are the myths of the modern age. Eternals delivers on this potential more than any superhero movie in the recent history. It is grand in scale, absolutely stunning visually, progressively cast and humanely told.It has melodrama in spades, but in a similar way the best X-men movies used to have. Each and every character is interesting and sufficiently nuanced.The action is clean and satisfying.The abilities are somewhat archetypal and simplistic but are represented with such gusto that every use of them is pure geeky joy.This is probably the most dramatically satisfying movie in the Marvel catalogue to date. Up there with Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and the Holland Spider-Man Movies.It is long and somewhat slowpaced.Jokes are as always might seem to some to be misplaced....
The movie is TRULY diverse in its cast. In many ways that might annoy a certain type of movie goer/comics reader. But the diversity is not the point. It just makes the characters sooo much more real. Which is a good thing....
TLDR: Illiad + Xmen + Justice League Animated Series = 10 out of 10 for Eternals.",Eternals

Before watching the trailers and the movie, I never knew who these characters were, yet, I still believe that each of these characters are some of the greatest characters in the MCU, bringing a much too needed change to the universe. I believe fans need to stop fixating on Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, they are dead now, and fans will have to deal with that fact.The whole LGBTQ+ 'contraversy' is nothing, the kiss in the film was totally justifiable given the life or death situation, and shouldn't even be an issue to begin with!There is also no culture or diversity properganda shoved down our throats!!!There is soo much I can write that is good about this film, there are a few 'nitpicks', but overall, this is a fantastic movie, the cast, directors and staff should all be extremely proud of themselves for giving us such a beautiful masterpiece!",Eternals

Yes, there's also the lack of character development. But if you watch the entire movie, it leaves you wanting more somehow. You can see how it all fits together, even if some parts are lacking. It leaves you with this sense of satisfaction, a unique one that cannot be compared to either of the INFINITY WAR or ENDGAME, but a satisfaction nonetheless. And if the sexuality is what's bothering you, then shame on you.I expected it to feel like an eternity, and it did--yet, somehow that eternity was well spent, and I want to watch again.

The movie's placement was more serious than other movies' and there were less fight scenes than I expected to be, but there's nothing wrong with that! I liked it!

Thought out, different characters. Liked them all.GOOD representation for anyone. Different race? Boom heres half the eternals of different races. Sexuality? BOOM we have 2 loving dads. Hard of hearing? BOOOM WE GOT A COOL DEAF SUPER HERO. This film really did focus on the characters, and i enjoyed that a ton. They all felt like people and I could relate myself to at least 2 characters. Plot wise its a shaky start, but i see long potential for more movies
Cons-
The movie lacks in the clear department. I was confused for at least 30 minutes it felt like and thrown into character death that I didn't know how to feel about. However I will say, as I learned about each character I understood more and more, and began to actually mourn for any characters dying. I just wish I wasn't confused for such a long time at the beginning of the movie.Overall or TLDR; I cannot wait to see where they take the characters and I hope that they improve some writing to make info more clear.

988,freetimehobby,Making a deep story occasionally makes a flop,4,7 November 2021,"The strength of this movie plays into the star-studded cast. There are no complaints on my end from acting in any sense. I believe Jolie, whom was under-utilized, did a great job with what role she had in this one, but you can't dress up a bad storyline.Everything in this plot was original Disney princess (Cinderella, Snow White) fluff with superheroes.Recurring themes appear. Two characters (Sersi & Ikaris) are exes who are in love for thousands upon thousands of years, and that love for each other saves the end battle scene, but Sersi also has a mortal lover who has a ""family secret"" (STAY UNTIL THE VERY END OF THE CREDITS).Next comes Gilgamesh and Thena (""drop the A"" as she says in the movie), Gilgamesh is a devoted lover to Thena. Thena has gone absolutely bonkers and assaults everyone and anyone, even her own lover. Gilgamesh and Thena live together when the group tries to reunite. Gilgamesh clearly doing what he can to love on Thena and Thena just being a screw loose and a dollar short of anything in this universe. There's probably some cheesy ""he loved her through everything"" bit here. It's horribly oversold. As would be a strong prediction, useless Thena gets her lover killed because she's still a screw loose and a dollar short of understanding why she's remembering.After Gilgamesh dies in combat, Thena then realizes where she left that loose screw and that extra dollar. She becomes one of the most impactful heroes of all time. I guess watching your lover get stabbed eleven or so times and his life force sucked out of him would make you want to get it together.Then you have the wicked ""stepsister"" in Sprite. Sprite is a kid who can never grow up. Neither could Pinocchio, but his story was far better and effectively told. A majority of Sprite's plot is dedicated to talking about how she wants to date Ikarus, but since she's always a youth, she can never be loved. After discovering Sprite is jealous for the twentieth time in the storyline, Sprite stabs Sersi in the near climax of battle because she is ""jealous"". If a theme like jealousy has to be stated by a character, the storyline didn't build it up enough.Of course, as any person would do, after being stabbed in the liver by Sprite, and finishing battle, Sersi decides she and her band of heroes can turn Sprite into a ""real human"". At the end of the film, Sprite is noted as being grumpy that she has to go to ""human school"" but oddly enough WANTED to be human ALL movie.The goal of this movie was to make a deep river of philosophical story telling, but man is it a puddle. It is the second longest movie to Avengers End Game and man, it should have been about thirty or forty minutes shorter.So why does this get four stars? First, it is not a Batman v. Superman fiasco. Second, there are light-hearted moments and the human character following the cast as the documentarian is incredibly delightful to the story and fills that void of human connection.",Eternals

1003,fredrik_ottenfelt,A sore sight for the eye,9,7 November 2021,"The visuals and the performance of this movie blew me away. Unbiased opinion, even though I'm a huge Marvel fan I was ready to be let down. But Chloe Zhao really outdid everything. They portrayed alien species meeting their makers, and even the galaxys makers.Eternals shows a bigger picture rather than just the mortal humans or aliens (like Gotg) perspective. Showing how big of an impact the eternals could have/had on the humans even though they were told not to interfere. At first I was like ""yeah, Fiege wants more to milk out of the Thanos story"", but they did show another side of the coin on why the eternals couldn't do anything even though they wanted to save the humans and in Sersei's case, her new loved one.The story and all characters was alot to process, I understand some might take that as tedious, but I cannot disagree more. It adds depth and a core for the characters to build on, unlike Venom and Carnage that have better reviews than Eternals (????), which had no build ups and jumps straight into a brawl of nothingness.Eternals have spectacular action, showing the immense power they posess. Stunning fight scenes with a bit of humor, but not any forced down our throats comedy that Disney have a profound idea of doing. I can't say more than wow. I was really satisfied with this movie.",Eternals
1004,khammonsense,Great storytelling but could have been better!,8,8 November 2021,"Eternals had a slow build up but I liked it. I rather it be slow and they explain their story rather than it feel rushed and make you confuse. The bad is that it was hard to give focus to so much MCU history and so many characters as each of them have their own purpose and role compacted into one movie without losing the entire plot of the movie. The deaf character Makkari didn't really get a story at all while others did which was a shame since this was a historical first for the MCU. I felt like this was a missed opportunity they glanced over. They briefly linked some characters to be the influences of myths and legends, but I don't think it came across as well as they intended especially for people who do not know the myths or the stories, scenes they referenced. The Darwin jab, Ikaris, Athena, etc. I had to explain to my family about some of that. Visuals were great and to be expected. The good part they got right was the diversity that it told as well as a story of a dysfunctional species of superbeings and their relationship to human kind and to themselves. It was relatively relatable because they each had their own strengths and weaknesses which made you understand each of their actions. It also shined a light on how some species change over time and how the ""good"" guys aren't always good and how the ""bad"" guys aren't always bad. Without giving away spoilers, I like the link of how the eternals connect with humanity over thousands of years to end up trying to prevent the humans demise and their own. How they looped their plot in with everything with Infinity Wars/Endgame made sense to me as to why these events caused them to ""come out"" of hiding.",Eternals

Guess what you are",9,8 November 2021,"Just finished watching it with my wife and 2 teenage kids, we all enjoyed it except my wife who is a jolie fan and thought she could of had more screen time or dialog. Clearly biased.Look, my fav marvel movie is still Ironman 1, this is not a ""typical"" marvel movie, because frankly it shouldn't be. 25, 26 films in, we should grow up a bit and let it have an identity. I thought the tone and the character settings were almost perfect, these are the ppl that only had one agenda for thousands of yrs (or they thought), but each is unique and have their own characteristics and agendas, they don't belong and don't fit in, the inner struggles each faces for so freaking long are real. Movie and its build up suppose to be a slower paced, yet still has great action sequences and timely comedic reliefs. Nevertheless this is a drama, about OLDER superheros in the MCU, so it does have a mature feel to it, like a fine wine. Anyone wants raunchy, like a beer, wait for guardians 3. I throughly enjoyed Eternals, thought it was great, didn't even realized it was 2 and half hrs cuz the drama keeps you in. It's definitely a welcomed changed a pace for MCU and something different.",Eternals

1010,esukrit,Great entry refreshing the Marvel franchise,10,8 November 2021,"By Infinity War, the Marvel movies had been getting formulaic, and I felt done with them. Eternals changed that for me. It not only deepens and expands the world-building, it introduces new themes into the MCU. The first generation of Marvel movies emphasized the individual. This new general (Eternals, Shang Chi) emphasizes the connection to family and duty. A very different feel. I also like that this new generation of movie acknowledges the existence of a world beyond Europe/American, as one might expect for a series with putatively global scope. All in all, a great entry -- congrats Marvel, you've drawn me back in.",Eternals

Also the absence of main villain makes it's final climax less interesting.",Eternals
1014,jydxrqjk,Surprisingly enjoyable,9,8 November 2021,Based off of critics reviews I was worried but once I watched it I enjoyed the overall movie. I love the observations it made on humanity and didn't hit you over the head with it. I feel if there were to be a sequel it could delve in more such ideas with more depth. I love marvel and indeed this wasn't your typical marvel movie but I feel I like the risk they took with this in being not too overly stuffed sometimes with action and lots of things happening at once. It was nice to take a different approach where it took a more emotional approach to a superhero movie using their family dynamic to tie it in. Overall it was great but I did see a disconnect from the marvel universe and wished maybe the powers of some characters would have been more imaginative such as Thena's or Cersei's.,Eternals

Or maybe they're supposed to be hands off, but in the process of being hands off; they became the gods of ancient civilizations?Several scenes felt like they were forcing the ""burden of duty"" aspect of each character. We get it- they've been on Earth for 7000 years.The whole thing felt like a nod at being as inclusive as possible, throw in a couple of great cinematic scenes and then go back to being inclusive, and then figure up a solution in 4 minutes.

1019,jake_lewis-20744,Mid-Tier Marvel Movie,7,8 November 2021,This was a gorgeous film. The cinematography in a majority of the scenes was mind blowing. Where most people see a problem with this movie is it's pacing and lack of context for the characters. They did the best they could to create enough story that informed the audience without to much filler. Where this movie lacked in character development it gained in great action sequences and an intriguing future for the MCU.,Eternals
1020,winstone_h,Amazing... but it's what I expected,7,8 November 2021,"The visuals, casting, and acting were all phenomenal. However, the plot failed to captivate me. It reminded me of Avengers Assemble, but on a much larger scale. The aliens landing on Earth and then the superheroes saving the planet did feel somewhat repetitive.But, as I previously stated, this is partially forgotten when watching the incredible special effects, visuals, and Richard Madden on the big screen. Words cannot express how realistic looking and visually stunning this film was. Kumail Nanjiani's character's one-line jokes were definitely needed to lighten the mood, which many of the moviegoers appreciated.SPOILERS
This was the part that confused me the most - how was this happening at the same time as Loki, and Falcon And The Winter Soldier? I had the impression that the Celestial demonstrated the existence of a more powerful being than the Watcher and the Time Keeper, but is this true? The film once again proved that the Earth and any other planet in the universe could be easily destroyed, if not by Thanos, then by the Celestial, and who knows, perhaps an even more powerful being will appear next.",Eternals
1021,junorbi-03324,Such a disappointment,1,8 November 2021,"The visuals of this movie are OK, nothing special in Marvel terms, and that's all good things I can say about it. After wasting 2 and a half hours watching it, one cannot decide if it wanted to be an origin story, a hero journey or some epic end of a story. Maybe all, but mostly none. Full of clichés, but even only bad clichés. Very constrained plot that wanted to show all characters' struggle and ended up showing none. The characters are forgotten 10 minutes after exiting the cinema. Putting 2 famous actors in roles that they don't even fit doesn't necessarily make a good movie. Overall, the movie has no ideas of hero stories, boring and even annoying. If there was a chance to request my money back, I would do it. Waste of money and time.",Eternals

I dreamed of a similar story in the MCU. I am in awe of the beauty of this film and the story it tells. The cast is perfect.

1029,jeb_mungall,I wanted to like this film but...,3,9 November 2021,"Playing on ancient aliens type themes, the film tries too much and basically attributes all human ingenuity and progress to these Eternals. There are simply too many threads going on in this film to have any satisfying pay-off. Its visuals are generally pretty good-but nothing we haven't seen before. Frankly, I feel like they did a bit too much. Some of the characters are fun, but frankly, there are too many to keep track of for a comic film where every character is new to us and the MCU (and I'm fairly familiar with Marvel comics). Furthermore, it feels like there were overt attempts to appeal to the Woke mob (as Marvel seems wont to do these days). It's fine to have an ethnically diverse cast-and of course we have our LGBTQ representation that seems like a requirement these days (though still easily cut for Chinese distribution because they're not going to alienate the PRC of course). But the only white male in the primary cast who seems to have the most power is our surprise villain. It's rather heavy-handed allegorically if you're sensitive to it. But all that aside, the film has too much going on to be as cohesive of a story as it should be. It's not boring though, so I can give it that.",Eternals

The visuals and CGI were spotless and the acting was great. This was a story movie and the action was underwhelming at some parts but I never found myself bored throughout its 2hr 40min runtime.

1035,star005,A new type of Marvel film,8,9 November 2021,"Eternals is a far different type of movie to any other Marvel movies. I see a lot of reviews and people complianing about the length and pace. It takes a slower pace and a long time to build up, but for those like me who prefer build-up to constant action, it's a great watch. Don't go in expecting to be constantly engaged in the action or flashy visuals, this isn't a light-hearted or ""fun"" movie in comparison to other Marvel films.It's not perfect, as there are some plot choices that I think could be done without, and the main couple stuggles to have a convincing chemistry, but overall the characters were fine. You will find yourself adoring the side characters much more than those who are the main focus, though! There's great representation and I found myself really loving the cast, even if it took a while for me to get a feel for them. I liked the plot and it did well at capturing the sort of cosmic terror the major threat in this film brought.The overall concept is interesting and the film is very visually appealing. It takes on a more alien or space-like vibe, with locations from ancient civilizations to modern day on earth as the backdrop. I loved the variety of locations, though if I had to nitpick, I really *really* dislike the ""superhero"" costumes. The thick material looks hard and clunky on the actors. Everything else was wonderful, though.",Eternals

Here we have a film slow or rather slower than usual for a marvel, with less fight but focusing more on characters, characters that are never boring, characters that I would love to see again unlike characters like cpt marvel, baby black widow or falcon who are only meh characters.Some characters like antman are nice but only have more than average movies.",Eternals

None of it matters to the MCU as a whole, and nobody coming out of the movie will remember the characters' names except for maybe Sprite and Icarus. The CGI fighting is the only redeemable part of this movie.It is the only MCU movie with a sex scene. Why does it need one? Hell if I know. The making out immediately before it was _quite_ long, after about 4 seconds of sucking face you get the picture.There are a LOT of plot holes, the director has only directed realistic fiction in ""independent films"", and it frickin' shows. My guess is that Chloe Zhao never watched the rest of the MCU. I watched Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans, and the scriptwriter hadn't seen any of the 6+ gundam shows since 1994 for a show that she was writing in 2014, so I can safely say that this kinda thing has happened before.The Eternals movie is 2 hours and 45 minutes, and it has about 90 minutes of pointless dialogue. None of it matters, this felt like a ""genocide is bad"" movie written by a fourth grader that has never worked retail or been in a fistfight, let alone see the actual reality of war or seen even a basic documentary about how fascists rise to power.The action is tropey, but the plot holes are worse.Action scenes are basically coin flips to decide whether a hit will be substantial or just another jab.You will wonder how powerful these Eternals are if SHOTGUNS AND RIFLES are used as a semi decent weapon against the Deviants, and ""the most powerful"" Eternal can't hit the broad side of a barn.The pool where green lady falls in goes from 25 feet deep to 2 feet deep.Angelina's character is a robot and somehow the Celestial forgot to reset her properly? The Celestial knows what happens on Earth and doesn't immediately know when the Eternals rebel?Why were the Deviants created? How come the one Deviant is basically Cell and absorbs eternals?Why was the special deviant killed off in a scene that is very similar to Luke killing the Wompa in Star Wars ep 5?The crazy sickness that affects Angelina Jolie's character is a subplot of a subplot that goes nowhere.My mother pointed out that ""after the fourth time of 'We've gotta go back', I thought it was a little much"". No, seriously, that phrase comes up a LOT.TLDR 3/10, the only good thing about this movie was the decent acting during the fight scenes, the Celestial, the intelligent Deviant and the CGI.",Eternals

I enjoyed each character's story line, I think they gave each a well deserved time on screen, and I even bought up their relationships and internal conflicts. It was very well structured. The visuals are gorgeous, the fights scenes are good and well distributed, there is a clear message... I mean, it is a story we have seen and read before, true, but it isn't poorly executed or acted or written. So I'd give it an overall positive review. Far better than Thor: The Dark World or Iron Man 3 or Black Widow. Quite frankly my only 2 issues were: (1) the trailers have major spoilers.

Mild/vague spoilers ahead.I get it's not your typical marvel movie, and it's very different than what we've seen before in the MCU, but it was honestly really good. Marvel movies can't keep following this typical unlikely rise of a hero trope that has become known otherwise they'd eventually grow to become predictable to an extent. This movie still had its predictable moments and familiarities with that theme, but it was something new and different than what has been done in the MCU. And it really tackles some philosophical question in a fun way but can definitely get you thinking about a lot. Plus, it opens up so many doors with how the rest of the MCU could proceed. The visuals were also insane!For those saying that the characters lacked depth, I disagree. I get that they definitely had some barriers to overcome with introducing a cast of entirely new characters with completely different stories than what we have come to know and in some ways the characters may have seemed a little rushed. However, it's quite the task to introduce that many characters and make you care at all for them and I think it was handled pretty well considering the circumstances. I also think that the emphasis on each of these non-human beings' humanity and the navigation of morals/ethics that the plot is centered around is something to really appreciate. And there is no way you could argue that the movie was rushed with a 2.5 hour screen time, to fit more in would have forced them to create the movie in two parts which just isn't reasonable if the movie isn't infinity war//endgame. Chloe Zhao definitely had quite the project to tackle, but to me it was extremely enjoyable because it was different. The actors were phenomenal as well at portraying their characters and just overall an outstanding cast.Overall, the movie was definitely worth seeing but forget what you know about marvel and consider this a different entry point into the same universe. It's its own story and yes will connect with the MCU, but is separate from the lore we have come to know up until the climax. There is much to appreciate about this movie if you drop the expectations and really really cool characters to come to know and character development to look forward to in future films.9 stars because honestly I really liked how different it was than the rest of marvel movies but also what it contributes to the future of the MCU. I just wish it hadn't been as predictable and didn't have some of its cheesy moments (as most/all marvel movies do).",Eternals

Maybe it just takes a bit too long to get to where it's going?... or just too many unfamiliar characters to get to know?.... I'm not sure, but halfway through this I was starting to think it's one of the worst things marvel has produced to date. I felt like probably 2/3rds of the film was just trying to get you up to date with what was going on, so by the time it actually got started properly I was already a bit done with it. It pulls itself back a bit with some impressive action scenes and special effects, but the characters just feel a bit sacrificial and most are probably not going to be important moving forward. I like some of the ideas it opens up in the franchise but it all just felt a bit forced..... a bridge to where marvel is taking things perhaps.",Eternals

1062,DopamineDavid,A good example of trying to much.,3,3 November 2021,"Eternals was a movie I had zero feelings about going into the cinema. What I met was a way too long, way too poorly paced, and way too lacking in a lot of aspects. I felt like Eternals was a movie that wanted to be everything at once. It was an origin movie, a setup movie for the future of MCU, and an ensemble movie. In my opinion, it failed in every aspect simply because it tried to be everything at once.I had zero emotion invested in them as characters cause nobody had time to grow and connect with the audience, the movie failed in pacing cause it needed to explain way too much. The CGI was pretty and the first act of the movie is the strongest.The last 30 minutes of this movie is around the poorest MCU have made.I will see it again, in case I missed something but if you are a marvel fan then of cause you want to see it, I don't know who else would like this.It tries to answer some philosophical questions and I like that MCU wants to try this, but it does it half-hearted. It felt like it wanted to be something different and yet still felt into existing tropes.Well, it's pretty, a few good jokes and some decent action. Visual it should be viewed in the cinema, but as a film, you could rather watch it at home and drink every time the Eternals line up in a straight line - you are gonna get drunk.",Eternals

Very unique and enjoyable century-spanning story that sets it apart from all other Marvel movies. Perhaps the most impressive part, however, is that they were able to introduce 10 brand new characters and give them each their own different, interesting and enjoyable personalities.

I can't connect the dot... don't see how it move the current MCU timeline... felt very disconnected and separated.Eternals as the almighty demi gods are not that powerful actually... Thor can beat all of them easily. It took them thousands of years to eliminate the Deviants. Thor and Hulk can do same things in 5 years easily.Eternals should not exist in the MCU... but seeing it as a standalone movie without thinking how it relates to MCU... I really like the movie.It's a high concept movie similar to Dune where it centers around theologies... kinda biblical approach in telling the story of how the universe and human beings were created and evolve.I also believe the writers are afraid to delve deeper in the theologies aspect because they need to put this movie within the MCU and this made the movie feel uneven and all over the place.Overall I enjoy the movie... the fight scenes are amazing and THIS IS ANGELINA JOLIE movie... I don't care about other characters.. if Marvel decide to write off the movie from MCU because of the worst MCU reviewed movie status... I don't care BUT Thena should live on in the MCU... she have the best power set among the Eternals.If you approach this movie thru MCU thoughts, I don't think you gonna like the movie but it still a recommendation from me 7/10.Black Knight is a great Marvel character... can't wait to see Jon Snow become The Black Knight.

1072,bigalod,Enjoyable but overly ambitious,7,8 November 2021,"Let me preface this review by stating that I'm a big MCU fan who has enjoyed the connected storytelling that these movies, and now shows, share. The Eternals moves the storytelling along in a more cosmic sense, but it was a mixed bag result.So, does The Eternals deserve the worse ratings in MCU history along with being worse than the worse of DC's offerings? Not really. It is easily better than at least several MCU movies.The plot is very ambitious to tell in a movie format, but it is pretty straightforward. Time jumps are clearly labelled and necessary for character development as we track these characters over 7,000 years. If you're confused by an obviously labelled time jump, you have other problems to deal with. The protagonists are compelling but there are too many of them for an origin story. The story is more mature with less humor than other MCU offerings, so this might turn you off by it. But, ultimately, it is a story about humanity and what it means to be human and somehow be influenced by it (or not) even if you're immortal.The cinematography is gorgeous, but it doesn't always work well with CGI, especially in darker settings. I feel the the use of Stagecraft (how they film Mandalorian) would've been a better fit for this movie. I would even say that the story of The Eternals would've been better served as a Disney+ show.I enjoyed the movie for what it is: an MCU origin story that introduces us to new heroes, how they are influenced by humanity, and the bigger perspective of how the cosmic side of the MCU fits in. The Eternals is going to be divisive but, fortunately, there are no cringe-worthy ""Martha"" moments to face palm over.",Eternals

The landscapes, the use of natural light, even the aesthetic of everything Eternals-related is simply mesmerizing. The fight scenes are actually cohesive, so you can fully comprehend what you are seeing, and it shows clearly how strong the characters are, how they individually fight with their own styles, and how tough their enemies are.Eventhough the movie is very long and it has some slow paced moments, it is introducing at least 7 new characters that are going to be in the MCU for a while, so it is not an easy accomplishment - and it does it very graciously. The team is formed by different people, with different powers, points of view, motivations, and you have enough time to understand what makes them individuals.Ironic that a film about humanoid-deluxe-robot-aliens can show so much humanity and love for mankind. And for that, I have to say that it trully has a much better subtext than any other MCU movie, because it found it's own way to tell this story, and now I'm glad it did.",Eternals

The story is told in a very non-linear way which was a big chance to take, but works well.At the end of the day, Eternals left me interested and ready for what more Marvel has coming.

It made me feel that more attached to each of their story arcs, especially during the climax of the movie. I think you'll really enjoy this movie if you enjoy character storytelling in your movies.There were definitely a few moments that had me jumping in my seat, and there were many moments where I was on the edge, filled with anxiety for the outcome of the battles (as always).Overall, I can't stop thinking about this movie and the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

A villain that laughably the heroes all struggle to dispatch the entire movie only to have him ended in a blink of an eye, and a who dunnit moment that you can see from the start of the movie- Its disappointing sadly.

That is not to say you'll get lost though - I completely disagree with the reviewers saying it was too 'dense' or 'confusing' or 'hard to follow'. My favorite part was Kumail Nanjiani's performance.

The Story was crisp and I never really felt bored. Yes these stories deserve time and they need to be developed and I feel a series would be great.

Unfair reviews won't stop Oscar winning Chloé Zhao in this powerful and diverse work.",8,5 November 2021,"This movie definitely doesn't deserve all the hate it is receiving. I get that some people are used to fast paced superhero movies and have no patience for dialogues and slow script build ups; but I can't agree with them. Clhoé Zhao is magnificent here; all the ten characters evolve well and we attach to them and understand their motivations, the twists and turns the movie throws at us using the epic concepts are incredible and everything is visually convincing. Moreover, this is a breaking point for Marvel's formula; Eternals stretches the old recipe and, although it still has past elements, it focuses on telling the story in a more mature way. This is a philosophical movie and it goes beyond Marvel's lore to deal with humanity's unanswered questions and create a cosmic ecosystem; it deals with life and death, explores worlds and creation and uses a huge scale to infer its grandiosity. Don't listen to the bad reviews and go watch Eternals with an open mind, be ready to embark on an epic long story that requires attention and patience, just like great deep movies/series always did; Lord of The Rings, Game of Thrones, etc. Beyond the amazing script and directing, Eternals is a mark for cinema diversity and inclusion; we finally have real people leading a Marvel blockbuster and minorities being respectfully represented; black, Indian, Korean, deaf, gay, immigrants with real immigrant accents. The importance of ethnic and cultural representation is enormous and it is already resulting in the banning of the movie in many countries; and don't get me wrong, but this is great! Marvel is affronting prejudice all over the globe. Although all the actors are incredible and everyone will have their favorites, I have to highlight mine; Brian Tyree Henry and Kumail Nanjiani are brilliant here and I want to see more of them. Overall Eternals is a great movie, very well structured with an ambitious script and a huge importance for Hollywood's scenario today.",Eternals

Most of the stuff was explained really nicely (however some stuff was done a bit too ""easy"", however I didn't really mind at all), and it was an entertaining watch overall. I'm also super doped for the sequel-- hello did you watch the ending?? (SPOILER?: HARRY STYLES as Thanos's brother? Wow didn't expect that one haha)I LOVED the cinematography, humor, characters and plot, and would definitely recommend giving it a go!

And oh my god it wasnt bad at all!So the best parts of the movie:
amazing visual effectsinteresting characterscelestials verry well doneI liked the plot twist didn't see that comingWorst parts:
the pacing ... yes ... it is slow often but i get the director where she was getting to like spend some time with this guys and you will get to care for them. Yes sorry no ... there where moments when I was feeling bored and don't get me wrong I like long conversation, steady shots, slow development, and so on but even for me it was a little slow paced.the story is not that bad but it does not keep you thinking that the good guys will fail in the endpost credit scenes - the first one is cool ... the last one - come on guys, you could have done much more than that!Overall it is worth the time and I am glad we saw this new characters introduced but the next movie should do much better than this one to keep them going in the mcu.",Eternals

It's an attempt at a prestige-style film directed by Chloé Zhao, fresh off her Oscar win, at a size and scale that none of Marvel's previous films have tried.

If you want a popcorn film you will be disappointed as there are no faceless armies and the sky beams are minimal. This is a character driven movie and does the best it can to flesh out this large essemble. This makes me excited for whats next.

1123,faeque,Pandering & Pretentious,1,8 November 2021,"Here's the thing, I respect the attempt at diversity and I support taking the mcu into a new, different era/tone. All that would have been great, **if** Eternals had managed to carry that off. But bottom line is this movie should have worked harder on its story instead of trying to pander-by-numbers to diversity. As a person of color, I find the blatant ploy to get audiences into seats so calculating that it's offensive.Some critics and audiences will try to spin this as a flawed, but brilliant and deep movie. I don't buy it. Everything in this movie but the vfx is weak, and the existential conversation is shallow and conflicting if not nonsensical. Maybe Marvel initially thought that pandering to the Chinese box office by having a Chinese born director is a sure fire way to hedge its bets against this experiment, and maybe critics and audiences think that having an Oscar winning director must mean the film is secretly good ... right? The critics will bend over backwards to shine up Chloe Zhao (just look at their glowing praise for the tepid Nomadland), and even now they're trying to separate Zhao from this film's failures, a generosity that they don't seem to apply equally to male directors, especially white ones. So before y'all complain that the film's blowback is just a form diversity bashing or sexism (yes, there is definitely some of that), but maybe sometimes a dud is just a dud. A $200 million dollar dud at that too.If you like really weird and rambling unfocused pretentious attempt of ""cerebral blockbuster,"" you might like this. But people go to Marvel films to be entertained, to be inspired, to actually care about the story and characters. This film is not it. Beyond some hardcore Marvel and Harry Styles Stans, and beyond some who want to pretend they're enlightened, tasteful, evolved supporters of diversity, I truly don't understand how the average audience is supposed to connect with this bland mediocre film.But sure, let's throw a bland sex scene in there to be edgy and different (even if it doesn't serve any story purpose)! Desperate. You don't need sex to sell even a moderately good movie.",Eternals
1124,jessebest,It has its moments but overall falls flat,4,7 November 2021,"First things, first I should warn anyone before watching this movie that yes it does have scenes of an LGBT family. Ignoring this issue that may divide audiences, the movie in itself was not bad but falls completely short of the MCU standard.The visuals and effects are on parr with some of the the other MCU but The whole movie seems to move in slow motion and is quite boring at times. Mixed in all this slowness, the movie filps back in forth between past and present, but will spend several minutes in one time period where I would often forget that this is not the present timeline and that there is just an enormous amount of backstory and exposition. There's some interesting twists but interactions between characters are mostly bland.I think part of the problem is that there were too many characters trying to compete for character development and I ended up not caring for any of them, just hoping the celestials would kill them off so we have the next big bad guy for the MCU. The movie is unique and has some cool moments but I think even the characters in this movie lack an identity to the point you'll probably forget half of them the next morning.",Eternals

1126,benjaminbryant,An intriguing surprise!,10,6 November 2021,"I went in thinking I knew what I was getting, as the film has been reviewed and discussed so much. I thought I understood the film and what it did right (and possibly wrong) for various folks. I also thought I knew ""how"" it deviated from fhe Marvel formula, and what it would keep. I was wrong in so many ways, sometimes completely, and that was an intriguing feeling for a Marvel film.Because of some things I won't share here to avoid spoilers, there are very real stales in this film there aren't in many of the other Marvel ones. By the last third, I felt I had zero ability to predict what would happen with and to our heroes and villains and that was kind of awesome. I found myself invested in ways I am not in the standard Marvel film.I also thought, for some reason, that it wouldn't be funny. I had it my head it would be a serious drama, devoid of Marvel joy. That wasn't the case, at all. It was plenty funny (not a comedy, by any means, but it had a lot of lightness) and the vistas and action looked and felt so different from other films. It was clear they shot on real locations without as many worlds ""created"" with CGI and I really found that really enhanced my enjoyment.I also worried it would feel too crowded with that many movie stars needing to serviced with screentime and big moments. But that wasn't an issue. Some spend whole stretches completely off camera and that lets other parts of the story breathe without having to play everyone in every scene.I will say this is the kind of film you might need a few hours or a day to fully process. It asks big questions, zigs when you expected it to zag, and makes some choices that are story service more than fan service, and we aren't always used to not getting what we expect. And there are a lot of new characters to experience and think about. I almost wish reviewers didn't have to write their articles right afterward, because I wonder if some would have had more nuanced take after having some time. But either way this is definitely a film to see yourself and form your own opinion on, as it may very well feel as brilliant to you as it did to me.Oh, and I am looking forward to seeing where Kit Harrington's Dane Whitman goes next.",Eternals

I do not have any issues with the director, she did a beautiful job bringing this script to life. The actors did a fine job as well. As for the script.... SPOILERS... Dear god where to start. The ""Deviants"" were about the worst and most bland Marvel Villains I have ever seen. Absolutely no substance or personality to them in any way. Their only purpose was so the main characters could have more fight scenes. Honestly they didn't even need to be in the movie it was so bad. Secondly, many people saw Richard Madsen and Kitt Harrington on the bill for this movie and that is why a lot of us wanted to see it despite its bad reviews. Well I'll tell you one thing, Kitt Harrington couldn't have been more wasted in this movie. He is in the movie for about 4 minutes and only as the boyfriend of the lead character. As for Rob Stark, you will be severely disappointed in what they do with his character. His actions legitimately make no sense at about the 1 hour and 40 minutes mark. Thats when the movie goes from ok to terrible. The plot is just so bad its hard to even believe that an executive at Marvel OR Disney didn't step in and demand a re-write? Also it was similar to Star Wars Episode VIII in all the ways people disliked that movie but I dont't feel like expanding on that as its been beaten to death already. I just cannot believe how poorly they missed the mark on villains. Falcon and the Winter soldier had better villains for heaven's sake. I actually feel bad for the cast and the Director... they did a great job with the script they were given but the plot was honestly so bad I began rooting for the main bad guy at the end so there wouldn't be a sequel. I can't imagine people clamoring for a sequel to this. I'd watch it though as I'm a mark for Marvel but this movie really did not need to be made.",Eternals

1138,alexpurdie-08997,The Past. The Present. The Future.,8,5 November 2021,"Whilst the plentiful use of monologue and complex and at some times convoluted plot may dampen the experience for some, The Eternals is a testimony to future things to come in the MCU, giving us the greatest look into the past that the MCU has had since Guardians of The Galaxy, and also a double dose of what to look forward to in the future. An extensive look into the history and origins or the universe and earth is ever present throughout the film, perhaps too much for some people liking, but for fans hoping for more theories and branches to the MCU, perhaps not enough and perhaps opening more doors of opportunity and confusion than the MCU and it's fans were ready for. The action sequences speak for themselves, beautifully crafted and choreographed, emotionally charged at points, and full of surprise and tension. Perhaps more than other MCU entries to date, you may find yourself on the edge of your seat. For some, the action may not be frequent enough, but it can only be agreed upon that when it is there, it is brilliant. Plot holes do loom in the film but not to an extent that harshens the progression of the film, however some unanswered questions and odd behaviour do complicate the plot from a viewers perspective, but it is nothing that the film gets stuck in the mud over. The visuals and cinematography live up to what you expect from the trailer with fabulous scenery and eye catching sets, The Eternals does not fade away from being extravagant. The film does a sound job developing character and gives wonderful unique aspects to all of its large ensemble, mixing comedy with tragedy, and action with recount. It is safe to say, for those who enjoy the intricacies of a shared universe, this film will be very satisfying. It is safe to say that fans of the cosmic MCU will be pleased. And it is safe to say that fans of the emotional and character side of the MCU will walk away with glee. But for those who may find it all a bit too over the top, or long, or slow at times, The Eternals may feel slightly underwhelming. Marvel Studios: The Eternals, 8/10.",Eternals

1147,lee_carver,Beautifully Shot but Forgettable,5,9 November 2021,"With this cast and Chloe Zhao I expected amazing / fantastic instead I got okay. There were some amazing parts but they were too few and far between. The rest (okay most) was slow and at times plodding. I was not tempted to walk out of the movie but if something had come up I would not have been sorry to miss it. For me it was the script. They had the pieces of about 4 good movies here. If you are a Marvel fan it is not a total waste of time but is by no means a ""must see"".*SPOILERS AHEAD*I don't believe in making comments without suggestions to ""correct"" what I personally found wrong but those are just my opinions and we know what that is worth.I didn't really care about any of the Eternals. Too many of them and not enough time was spent getting to know them. Sersi was the main focus (if you chose one) but in a lot of ways we ended up knowing the least about her. Her relationships did not feel real to me. She is supposed to be torn between Ikaris and Dane but I never really got the feeling she cared that much about either. She was also supposed to be the one who loved humans the most but again I didn't feel that. Don't even get me started on the ""sex"" scene which served no purpose at all.Ikaris was also an enigma to me. The rest of the Eternals seemed to easily agree to go against their creators yet he was willing to kill his brothers and sisters for them. You never got a good explanation as to why.The rest of the cast had interesting mentions but nothing was explored enough. Though personally I think they should have revealed more of them knew the real purpose of their mission than just two.My Stupid Solution: A Disney+ series should have been done to lead into the movie with single or multiple episodes to explain the characters. They could have focused on what they did individually after they split. Since so little was covered in the movie you could have done so without any spoilers.Villains: The Deviants served no purpose in this movie. The super deviant was never explained and was ended almost as if they were filming and someone decided they needed to at the last minute.My Stupid Solution: It could have been revealed that deviants actually have genetic memory. The reason they started killing people on their planets is that they remembered what was going to happen and were doing what they could to delay it (basically using Thanos' logic). You could also make ""Mad Weary"" not a actual medical condition but instead the deviants trying to communicate with the Eternals and tell them what is actually going on by showing them their past.Dane Whitman: Unclear why he was even in this movie at all. You could have just mentioned him and gotten the same effect.My Stupid Solution: Dane should have stayed with Sersi the whole time. Then during the final battle he should have gotten between Sersi and Ikaris summoning the Ebony Blade to protect her. His willingness to accept the consequences of the curse in order to protect her would have at least given their relationship some of the depth it was missing.There is more of course... why did Gilgamesh stay with Thena, how did Sersi change the one deviant, why did Makkari chose to live in the ship, why would a being who can create entire universes resort to making a robot army instead of a living one, etc...",Eternals

DISCLAIMER: Homophobes need to stay away,10,7 November 2021,"Chloe Zhao has delivered what might just be one of the most nuanced films in the MCU after Black Panther. From a diverse cast to brilliant direction, Eternals is a film that casual moviegoers can enjoy without needing to catch up on the previous films in this cinematic universe. For the Marvel fans its a visual spectacle with a well written storyline and that quintessential humor. The film packs a punch in terms of action and emotions. The film makes you feel the same kind of dilemma that the Eternals are faced with: Should humanity be allowed to exist or use it to make way for other forms of life? We get to see the conflict within the team when their ideologies create a friction and it eventually climaxes into the final act with some stunning cinematography.It might be easy for the audience to not give this film a go based on the ratings and the thrashing its receiving from the critics but watch the film with an open mind and then form your own opinions. Eternals is the first superhero film to portray a deaf superhero character played by a deaf actress and actors with varied racial backgrounds portraying the Godly beings. The film also beautifully portrays a gay relationship in a way that it doesn't feel forced. So, after watching the film one may wonder whether the film critics were on weed while writing the reviews for this film!",Eternals
1151,christianmusicman,Intriguing film but think about it this way...,8,5 November 2021,"As I have read the reviews posted, I'm a little confused as to some of the lower ratings. To begin, this is NOT your MCU/Avengers movie that you're used to. We know through the first 3 phases that there are cosmic influences and powers beyond our imagination but we've been experiencing these stories mainly on Earth with characters that everyone has known, in reality, for decades growing up. Now Disney/MCU is going where no man, except Captain Marvel, has gone before.There are some pros and cons to this film, which I will say is the most visually stunning MCU picture yet. So I am going to try to use generalities instead of movie specifics so not to spoil.Pros: As I said above, incredibly striking cinematography, this film was built for large home theaters and IMAX to fully engulf your experience. Larger than life! The cast was excellent... anytime you can pull favorites like Hayek and Jolie and they are fine with taking more of a backseat to the rest of the younger cast... I always appreciate that. As a history buff I appreciate the walkthrough of the ETERNALS life here on Earth and how it interwove with history... there's a lot of story to unpack, could've easily made this 3 movies and character built more effectively but I think the MCUniverse is fixing to explode with heroes and villains and Disney just couldn't spend that kind of time on each character within. Also want to give a big shout out to the levity in this film, mild but well timed!Cons: the story is choppy at times so you really have to pay attention to what era you are in. Really would like to have seen expansion toward the beginning and focused on the Deviants a little more but again, time to build characters is never easy and this could've been a 6 hour film. I do NOT appreciate a sex scene in my superhero movies, do NOT! It was mild in comparison to other PG-13 and R movies but be mindful bringing younger kids to the cinema. I understand that love is a central theme but I don't have to physically see it manifest to know that. There is a gay couple with an adopted child in the film so parents do with that information what you will. I wanted more story from the mains but I think some of that will come with time, and seeing it again.All in all, really enjoyed it. The movie doesn't follow the story line from the comics at all but it's like book adaptations, it's just impossible to navigate books effectively to movies and you feel you get the same experience. Don't listen to the negative reviews on here, go make your own opinion of this next phase... it's not Shang-Chi but thank God it's not Brie Larson as Captain Marvel either... horrible casting on that one, Disney!",Eternals
1152,akashsuryaa,Stunning visuals and sounds but little lacks in story and plitt,8,4 November 2021,Don't mind the critics if you're a marvel fan go watch it immediately and if you're a normal fan still you'll enjoy the film because its different from other mcu films.,Eternals
1153,mindejaime,A different and risky movie. Because of that - a masterpiece.,10,5 November 2021,"The movie Eternals takes time. It has nothing to do with the other MCU movies. It's much more poetic. There are those who say it is slow, I don't agree, I think there was a great concern to introduce the context well, to make sure that cliché situations were not created just so that they could use easy solutions. Eternals are neither heroes, nor villains, nor anti-heroes. They are purposeful beings, and they don't all have the same purpose. There is an enormous respect for each character, there are well-defined power levels, but all characters are carefully developed, which creates a complex and unpredictable plot. The film ventures into some more controversial sequences, but does it with such smoothness and mastery that the scene just flows naturally.It's far from the typical superhero movie, there's no fuss going on 100% of the time, there's no excess of lines, no senseless fights. There are, however, pauses, moments of introspection from the audience, which intensify the characters' pain and make us understand the side of both the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"". And all the jokes and fight scenes are epic and hit the timing on point.(Next paragraph may contain a really really vage spoiler, no names and no specific details mentioned, but it's just a warning)I just thought that it failed to develop a certain aspect that was crucial to the outcome. Something in the film has a lot more impact on a certain character, so much so that it makes her commit the unpredictable, not having as much impact on the audience, perhaps making them doubt why this character made that decision.",Eternals
1154,arjunkumarbetageri,Look beyond LGBTQ.. Desi tadka..,9,7 November 2021,This is one of the best storytelling movie in supehero genre.. Each heros got all the screen time its not like just beacuse your superman can do all at the end.. If phastos can do what he did to ikaris. I believe Iron man can defeat thor/sup (Given proper motivation).. Movie awesome it had all the elements.. Desi tadka.,Eternals
1155,shrivastavatanuj,The movie is good,9,5 November 2021,"It doesn't deserve the hate it is getring. For a change this is something different from marvel. I dont know if the critics wanted the generic one to one superhero movies or what, this movie is well written with nice twists. And the setup for the future is also nice.",Eternals
1156,royvos-90522,Big and heavy story,8,3 November 2021,"Eternals has a big, heavy, galactic story. The movie is great. It's not a topical marvel movie. So I can understand some people will dislike it. Need to see the movie again to absort the story more.",Eternals
1157,anasashraf-79378,Awesome,9,6 November 2021,"I know you wanted to make a different type of movie this time you were doing an experiment, I'm not saying that the movie was Worthless actually the actions was damn good but there was too much romance and drama you know but still I'm giving you 4.5/5 because you made 25 mind blowing movie out of 26, and yes obviously 26th is The Eternals and i can forgive your 1 mistake because you did lot to me. And your worst is still better than any other movie. And the Conclusion is movie was good no doubt but not better than any other MCU movie that's it.",Eternals
1158,mattiafato,Epic and spectacular movie!!!,8,4 November 2021,"Now, this movie Is the best of the 4th phase of MCU, grafic, scenary and Battle are so incredible!!! It Is amuse from beginning to end. The plot Is original and compelling, the caracters designs are factional and they have a good reasons. (Only one thing doesn't me like but it is so difficult to explain without spoiler) final clash is fantastic and the end it isn't trival. Good story, good meter, good direction, screenplay and photography.Positively impressioned.",Eternals
1159,ranen-47520,One of the BEST MCU movie ever!,10,5 November 2021,"It's garenteed the most stunning yet meaningful movie that Marvel has ever made. It's a piece of art, so that it might not be suitable for everyone. But Chloé Zhao was able to bring this story into another level.Even these Eternals are god like creatures and so powerful, but mentally, they just like us.Finally, bringing up the question, ""Are humanity worth saving?""
Chloé's answer is ""Yes"".",Eternals
1160,macdmane,Good start,10,7 November 2021,"I just don't get it how can be possible some people rate 1 to this movie, as a fan of marvel, this was an amazing movie and a good start for the phase 4, don't read the bad negative feedback, just watch and take your opinion, you'll not regret it.",Eternals
1161,nischayd,"Epic, Dence, Visually spectacular",10,5 November 2021,"Brilliantly executed by Chloe Zhao. This movie expanded the scope of MCU, there are a lot of subjectivity to unpack.This movie is not just about action, it requires complete involvement throughout the movie.The visual effects were spectacular, for sure one of the top 10 MCU movies.",Eternals
1162,sathekgedavid,Astonishing work of art,9,5 November 2021,"Where do I even begin?Never have I been so perplexed by a movie's critic score.The visuals were breathtaking, and the action set pieces were glorious. It's the most beautiful movie I've ever seen, period.The score...my oh my...Ramin Djawadi's done it again. Brilliant. And the pacing is much better than I'd feared, considering the movie is 2.5hours long. Big plus for the diverse cast as well.The movie masterfully portrays its central themes of Purpose, Fate and Freewill, which are aided by the exceptional acting of the stars. It's definitely the most philosophical Marvel has ever dared to get.By the time the credits rolled, I was dawned by the satisfying epiphany that I was enthralled throughout the film, and not distracted by the sometimes forced comedy and prolonged action scenes that we've come to expect from some Marvel movies. Heck, it's not _just_ a marvel movie, it's a grand sci-fi epic, that's meant to be enjoyed on the biggest screen possible. Which is why it's probably my favorite one yet. It's Big, Bold, and emotionally resonant. I cannot wait to see what the Director Chloé Zhao does with the characters next.I can see why some people might not
Love it, but I can vehemently proclaim that the low ratings are unwarranted! It definitely feels targeted.Ultimately, this is just my opinion, don't take it as gospel. Go watch it and form your own opinion.",Eternals
1163,aashiqjacob,Better than ShangChi and Black Widow.,10,6 November 2021,"I don't understand, all the hate this movie is receiving. I didn't expect much while going to watch the movie after seeing all the reviews, but it turned to be a awesome movie.",Eternals
1164,ayanmajumdar-09332,Awesome in one Word,8,5 November 2021,"I don't know why those critics rate the movie so bad,It has a great story, with lots of great action & great visual effects.... Must watch.. Don't miss those two credit scenes...",Eternals
1165,shmidinshiller,ETERNALS,10,7 November 2021,"It's is a great movie! ETERNALS.It's not really like a marvel movie!And with a soild story................
And has got a great post credit scene.",Eternals
1166,yasinalif-32939,worse than THOR 😑,2,5 November 2021,"Bad directing, Bad screenplay, Badly written, its worse than THOR nickthefreak Bad directing, Bad screenplay, Badly written, its worse than THOR. The reason is said to be the film's LGBTQ representation but this is a false narrative pushed from MARVEL team for saving face. Eternals is jammed to the rafters with great ideas, but too many end up weighing the film down instead of letting it fly. The story is bloated and underdeveloped, featuring too many characters and a clumsy plot. Chloé Zhao] is somehow out of her element here as she struggles to juggle multiple character arcs throughout the ponderous 157-minute length.",Eternals
1167,chayankedia,One of the top three MCU movies ever. Can't wait for sequel.,10,6 November 2021,"This movie had everything. The story telling, the action sequences, the comic relief, the character development, the bond between certain characters, the emotions, the twists. This and every other thing expected from a MCU movie. You could not have asked for a better way to begin phase 4.The acting was also great. Screenplay was almost perfect. The cinematography was amazing. I just didn't want the movie to end. Absolute gem of a movie. What I loved the most was that every character was given a fair amount of screen time to showcase their character development and abilities. The duels were top notch. First half was great and second half was even better. Hope we have a sequel and soon. ""Remember""",Eternals
1168,marllowollram,Eternals takes the MCU to a whole new level with all its greatness and preciousness,10,4 November 2021,"From the intro with the scrolling words, reminiscent of an epic classic, to the last post-credits scene, Eternals takes us on a journey through the history of planet Earth, in the vision of ten powerful beings who have come to help mankind evolve. Everything in this film is well crafted, with great sensibility and dedication from Oscar winner director Chloé Zhao. All the characters, from Kingo's human butler to the celestial overlord Arishem, are magnificently and deeply developed, and we can clearly understand the pains of these people. And of course, how can we not talk about the cinematography and visuals of this film? Zhao didn't mess around here, she brought the most stunningly beautiful film in the entire MCU. I would like to point out how the inclusion in this film is the most truthful and well-executed of the genre. All in all, even with the few flaws in the film, Chloé Zhao has brought the most heartwarming, honest, different and greatest film from the studio. Honestly, this is what I would like to keep watching in the MCU, more intense and insightful films with different viewpoints. There is a certain strangeness to it but a necessary change. It's time to embrace the new in this universe. Eternals is clearly the turning point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and we are definitely moving towards a more diverse, different, and certainly very wonderful MCU.",Eternals
1169,haseeb_babar,Not as terrible as the reviews suggest,7,8 November 2021,"It's an okay movie really, falls short of generally the MCU standard. The CGI is meh sometimes, the alien- dogs look fake but overlooking the technical flaws, this is actually a decent movie and worth watching. The critics reviews are too harsh. I will say not everyone would like this but most of you will.",Eternals
1170,gabi_lopezf,So disappointing,5,6 November 2021,"I have been waiting for this movie since I saw the trailer, I had so many expectations thinking it would be at the level of Avengers:Endgame, watching the movie it felt like the characters needed more development their dialogue was so bland, maybe a series would have been better, most of the times I thought that the characters were doing random things, like the Bollywood star who at the end of the movie randomly disappears or the little girl who stabs her friend and a day later they are like oh I will miss you so much, don't even mention Ikarus flying to the sun like what was that, the celestial emerging from the earth didn't cause any tsunami, no one came to look at what was happening, some marvel characters can teleport like dr strange but no one cared, the deviants were moving at the speed of light tracking all the Eternals, deviants felt like a filler wanna be villain I expected more from their leader he just appeared out of nowhere on the beach in the last fight scene and went into a cave, like why? I truly wanted to like the movie I bought the tickets a month ago, I had so many expectations, but the movie failed to deliver what it was promising. Easily the worst marvel movie of all. Shang Chi and the 10 rings is 10x better than this movie.",Eternals
