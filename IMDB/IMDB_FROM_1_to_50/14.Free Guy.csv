0,SnoopyStyle,fun guy,7,27 September 2021,"Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a bank teller and Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) is his best friend. He's actually an NPC (non-player character) in Free City, an online video game. He goes through every day doing the same thing and getting robbed multiple times. One day, he spots Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer) and his world view expands. In the real world, she is Millie suing Antwan (Taika Waititi) for stealing her code. She is in the game trying to find proof of that theft.It's a good idea but it's Ryan Reynolds who makes this good. He is the fun guy. He makes this fun. I do have a couple of problems with the movie. The security guy at the secret stash should be an NPC. At that point in the story, he should start convincing the other NPCs to help him outside of their programming. Also, there's no reason why the evidence is stashed in a room in the game. I get that it makes it easier but it makes no sense. All that is a little besides the point, it's Reynolds and he's the fun guy.",Free Guy
1,boblipton,People Everywhere Just Want To Be Free,7,15 August 2021,"Ryan Reynolds is a non-player character in a shooter game, a teller at a bank which is robbed several times a day. His best friend is bank guard Lil Rel Howery and they love Free City, and their lives. Their world is divided into their peers and the godlike ""people with sunglasses"", who are the avatars of players. Then one day Reynolds spots Jodie Comer in sunglasses, and wants to talk with her. When he does, he catches a glimpse of the reality behind his existence and does the unthinkable. He steps outside the narrow paths of his existence and becomes a hero.It's not the first time this theme has come up in movies or even drama. What, after all, is Pirandello's SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, or Hubbard's TYPEWRITER IN THE SKY, but examinations of fate versus free will? Yes, this romantic comedy version of the fantasy wears its symbolic message, that we don't have to accept fate, that we can choose to be heroes and champions of kindness and life, a little too obviously to please me. Even so, its unfailing good humor, kindly disposition and great CGI won me over as a great popcorn movie. With Taika Waititi and a host of current stars in cameos.",Free Guy
2,Prismark10,Free Guy,7,1 October 2021,"I did play GTA III on the PS2 many years ago. So the free wheeling world of Free Guy had some familiarity.From the initial scenes where it is noticeable mainly due to lack of product placement and branding. Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a bank teller, Buddy (Lil Rel Howery) the bank security guard live in a virtual world.Guy realizes that he is actually an NPC (non player character) in Free City, an online video game. His artificial intelligence kicks in when he meets Molotovgirl (Jodie Comer.)In the real world, Millie (Jodie Comer) is suing software developer Antwan (Taika Waititi) for stealing the code developed by her and Keys (Joe Keery.)Somewhere in the game is the evidence that Antwan is the software thief.Free Guy is an action comedy that relies on the effortless charm of Reynolds. It riffs movies like Ready Player One, Truman Show even The Matrix.Disney who now owns 20th Century Studios even mine their properties ranging from Marvel to Star Wars which is also reminiscent of Ready Player One.It is a fun movie, although I'm sure Keys could had mentioned to his fellow workers much earlier that Antwan was a heel who had stolen the code.",Free Guy
3,nogodnomasters,Didn't see that coming,8,17 August 2021,"Blue shirt Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is an NPC that does the same thing everyday. When he sees a female player he goes out of character to meet her. It seems the program has an AI algorithm that allows the characters to develop. This turns his world upside down.There have been films with characters in games interacting with humans. Tron was the forerunner to all of this. There were numerous low budget films and who didn't fall in love with ""Glitch."" This film was fresh and funny. And like all great films, it was also a love story.",Free Guy
4,kosmasp,Free GTA,9,16 August 2021,"I reckon the future may hold a game like this for us ... where the AI is so developed, that NPC (non playable characters) live their own life in games, make their own decisions and so forth. Having Ryan Reynolds starring in this ... well it is a genius move to say the least. I called it the Ryan Reynolds show and I'm quite certain no matter if you like this or not, in this regard you will agree with me.Having said that, there are other characters who give it their all, especially our female protagonist. Her counterpart in the real world is as overdrawn as he can be ... Taika does a really good job ... he is actually more comically and one sided that most of the characters in the game he developed ... well others did for him.And then you have the ally in the real world ... a good guy who has to be convinced and who has to come around ... and who you may never feel as much sympathy for as you did for Ryan Reynolds. Even when you figured the ""twist"" in his character and where the story leads ... apart from the revealing a scam thing.Having said all that, the movie boosts a lot of cameos ""in game"" and also real world ... has references galore (not just to GTA and apparently Fortnite, have not played the latter yet, but also to movies and persons/movie characters/franchises)! This can be so much fun if you spot them - not sure how some will play out in say a hundred years ... but you can never tell or guess the impact of something like that.The movie is insane and a lot of fun and has even a moral message in it of sorts. You can detect some philosophical ideas in it too ... what is life and all that. But the main thing and the surface are there to entertain you ... so be entertained and have fun with this!",Free Guy
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Actually really good.,8,14 August 2021,"I did not expect that, this was chosen literally for convenience, I'd seen the trailers, and didn't think I'd enjoy it, it is so good. I'm sometimes hard to please with films, but this is definitely worth seeing. It's bonkers, it's crazy, but it's funny, and actually pretty moving at times, a more heart warming film then you'd think it would be.Some pretty amazing special effects, it is never boring at any stage.Ryan Reynolds is terrific, and fans if his will appreciate him being here, he's great, as is Comer.I didn't expect it to be this good, 8/10.",Free Guy
6,jboothmillard,Free Guy,7,19 August 2021,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I was a bit 50/50 about seeing it, but I'm glad I went with it and saw it on the big screen, directed by Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the Dozen, Night at the Museum, Date Night). Basically, Free City is an open-world video game developed by Soonami Games.In the game, Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a non-player character (NPC), works at the bank and spends time with his best friend Buddy (Get Out's Lil Rel Howery), unaware his world is a video game. The game, originally called Life Itself, was developed by Walter ""Keys"" McKey (Joe Keery) and Millie Rusk (Jodie Comer), but its code was stolen and redeveloped into free City by Soonami's head developer Antwan (Taika Waititi). Keys has since taken a job at Soonami, while Millie spends time within Free City as her avatar Molotov Girl to find evidence of her and Keys's code and prove they are the rightful owners. In the game, Guy encounters Molotov Girl, who is singing ""Fantasy"" by Mariah Carey, the song he says his dream girl will like and begins to deviate from his programming. One day, Guy takes a pair of sunglasses from a player who tries to rob his bank, through which he sees Free City from the player's head-up display. Guy speaks to Millie, she initially assumes he is a player named ""Blue Shirt Guy"", and not an NPC. She tells him to level up to over 100 before she will speak to him again. Rather than levelling up through the typical destructive acts, Guy opts to become a good guy, completing missions within Free City by stopping crimes. He becomes a worldwide sensation as players watch the progression of ""Blue Shirt Guy"". Millie and Guy meet again when she breaks into the Stash, another player's well protected area within the game that holds evidence of her source code. Guy helps Millie escape the Stash, and Millie recognises that Guy is becoming sentient and believes he can help her find their original code within the game world. Keys and Millie realise that Guy's self-awareness came about from artificial intelligence code containing Millie's personal preferences that Keys had included in Life Itself, which in turn had led Guy to develop a romantic interest with Millie. Millie tells Guy the truth that he is part of a video game, Guy is upset and breaks off their relationship, because he cannot live a life that is not real. However, after talking with Buddy about the situation, he is reminded of moments in time that are real and meaningful. Guy gains full sentience and returns to Millie, agreeing to help before Free City is wiped from Soonami's servers to make way for its sequel, Free City 2, in two days. Guy breaks into the Stash again with Buddy's help, but its owner Revenjamin Buttons (Channing Tatum), who is actually nerdy teenager Keith (Matty Cardarople), recognises Guy as ""Blue Shirt Guy"", and gladly hands over the evidence. Guy's continued popularity threatens the launch of Free City 2, and Antwan orders Keys and his new partner Mouser (Utkarsh Ambudkar) to reboot the game, but Keys refuses and is fired, and Antwan reboots himself. The reboot means Millie finds Guy without any memories of his sentience. But recalling Keys's advice that Guy would need a reminder, she kisses him. Guy's sentience is restored, and he recalls the location of the Island, part of Life Itself that will not be protected from the pending data wipe and is the only proof of Millie's and Keys's original code. Guy and Millie persuade the other NPCs in the game that they are more than their programming and to join them. Antwan tries to delete Guy and Molotov Girl from the game, but Keys interferes to protect them and direct them to the Island. Antwan then sends Dude, a bigger and unfinished copy of Guy developed for Free City 2, into the game. They fight each other, but Guy gains the upper hand, and is able to befriend his enemy. Antwan takes a final step of destroying the game's servers with an axe, but Guy makes it to the Island in time, an event seen by gamers all over the world. Millie coerces Antwan to return the Free City code and intellectual property (IP) back to her and Keys. Without the support of Millie's and Keys's code, sales for Free City 2 fall, and Antwan becomes wrapped up in several media controversies, resulting in him leaving Soonami. Keys, Mouser, and Millie start a new company with the recovered code to release Free Life, bringing Guy, Buddy, Dude, and the other Free City NPCs into it. Free Life is a success, and Millie realises that Keys's created Guy as a representation of what he likes about her, including the enjoyment of the Mariah Carey song, and embrace and kiss. Also starring Aaron W. Reed as Dude, Britne Oldford as Barista, Camille Kostek as Bombshell, Mark Lainer as Hostage, Mike Devine as Officer Johnny, Vernon Scott as Bank Manager, and a cameo by Chris Evans, with the voices of Hugh Jackman as Masked Player in Alley, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Bank Robber #2, Tina Fey as Vacuuming Mom, and John Krasinski as Silhouetted Gamer. Reynolds plays a really likeable everyman style character, Comer putting on an American and her own British accent is equally charming, the game metropolis world is essentially a cross between Grand Theft Auto and Second Life, the story both celebrates and mocks geek culture and virtual world gaming, there are surprisingly exciting sequences of fights and chases, the special effects are fantastic, and there are some great laugh-out-loud jokes, an enjoyable and funny science-fiction action comedy. Very good!",Free Guy
7,paul_haakonsen,Quite enjoyable...,7,25 September 2021,"Well, as I sat down to watch the 2021 movie titled ""Free Guy"" I hadn't actually seen the trailer or heard about the movie. But I saw that Ryan Reynolds was in the lead, so of course I opted to sit down and watch this movie from director Shawn Levy.Needless to say that this movie was entertaining. Of course it was. And it was a glorious storyline and plot that combined elements of what you see in games today and mixing it in with the real world. Yeah, I have to say that I was definitely entertained by what writers Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn managed to concoct here with ""Free Guy"".Visually then ""Free Guy"" is a movie that you should watch twice. The first time you watch it for the story and the plot, but the second time you pay attention to the details that take place on the screen and the background. Wow, talk about an assault of visually great and funny things in every single scene. There were so many great things and habits shows here that you see in online games every day. It was just simply marvelous to watch. And the writers really captured the essence of that.""Free Guy"" has a nice cast ensemble. Of course Ryan Reynolds was great in this movie, and he definitely carried the movie quite well. But he had some good help from the likes of Jodie Corner, Taika Waititi, Lil Rel Howery and Joe Keery. And there was a nice appearance from the First Avenger himself.Yeah, there are a some hilarious pop culture references throughout the course of ""Free Guy"". And I must admit that the ""Star Wars"" reference was just the cherry on the top of the cake, it was just brilliant.This is a movie that you should take the time to sit down and watch, should you have the time and opportunity to do so, because it is an enjoyable and entertaining movie.My rating of ""Free Guy"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",Free Guy
8,BandSAboutMovies,"Meta, I guess",4,4 October 2021,"Free Guy should be a movie that I could have just shut my brain off to enjoy, but something in the back of my head kept punching me in the brain. It's a movie that rails against commercialism while being a major studio movie, a film that champions the individual while being an ersatz Ready Player One*, which is really just a patch off of The Last Starfighter, but I was enjoying its dumb summer movie energy and thinking, ""Well, this would have been fun to watch in a packed theater when we still did those things.""But then, spoiler warning, the main character used Captain America's shield and an actual lightsaber and I was out. Well, I was nearly out, then another character looked right into the camera and said, ""He has a lightsabre!"" as if we didn't know what it was in a moment that would have been smart if it were parody but really felt like studio notes. Like hey, will the kids know what this laser sword is? You know, it's only the most famous weapon since, I don't know, Excalibur.It's a bummer because I think Ryan Reynolds seems like a nice enough guy. Lil Rel Howery is a funny fellow. Taika Waititi makes really interesting movies within and without the machine. And yet, this just feels like a beta test, like it's missing something, and all of those Twitch gamer cameos are going to age just like Fred! The Movie.I've played enough Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto to get the jokes. And I love the wild action and effects throughout. But another point keeps bothering me. The Millie Rusk character made a game called Life Itself, which became Free City, and one of the characters within it - that she created - is her perfect man, the guy she's been missing her entire life. And sure, that could be completely romantic and make you wonder, is God in the machine and fate and we can't choose who we love. Or we could be cynical and realize it's a lot like Robert Crumb drawing dirty pictures for himself to sexually enjoy.Unlike The Truman Show, no one really flips out when they realize they're living in a simulation. I mean, I know how I felt when I learned the news. Now, I deaden myself with drink and Jess Franco movies. Maybe you can use this film and your stimulant of choice to numb your realization.*Actually, Penn wrote both of these movies, so I guess much like John Fogerty discovered, you can steal from yourself. It's also completely a worse version of Tron, but I figured I'd just put that in the footnote so I wouldn't come off as such a humorless jerk.",Free Guy
9,CinemaSerf,It's all about the man in blue...,7,15 September 2021,"Ryan Reynolds knows how to put a good, cheery, film together - and with this he has hit the mark once again. Its a sort computer-game based version of the ""Truman Show"" meets ""Groundhog Day"" effort this time, as he ""Guy"" encounters the feisty ""Millie"" (Jodie Comer) and soon the two are trying to break out of their contented, but routine and somewhat violent existence - discovering en route that that very existence is all part of a code and that they are but virtual playthings of subscribers.... Reynolds holds court here, the film is all about him and his ability to inject some gently pithy humour and excellent timing into the story. Comer is a perfect foil, and as the film gathers pace it turns into an engaging watch with loads going on and a fair bit of sarcasm - not a form of humour often seen these days. Taika Waititi steals his few scenes at the pompously named ""Antwan"" and by the end you might never want to go up to a bank teller again.",Free Guy
10,oscaralbert,Just as leading astronomers now realize that . . .,9,9 September 2021,". . . the extraterrestrial aliens are probably not all well-intentioned candy-munching benign fluff balls, FREE GUY suggests that A. I. entities may NOT have Humanity's best interests and prosperous well-being ingrained as their Prime Objective. Instead, it's more logical to think that any ""Artificial"" Intelligence will be inherently Evil, FREE GUY suggests. This revelation is particularly troubling given the fact that the U. S. Constitution does NOT require America's Presidents to provide any biological proof or test results showing that they actually possess the human genome. After a robotic Algorithm won the popular vote in 2000 (but was denied White House entry due to the confusing Florida butterfly ballot), who's to say that we were not ruled from 2017 until 2021 by a fiendish AI ""businessman non-playable character""? Many of these are seen during FREE GUY (though none of them suggest that people gargle with bleach).",Free Guy
11,neil-476,Great fun,9,16 September 2021,"Free GuyGuy wakes up every morning, greets his goldfish, eats his cereal, gets the same coffee from the same barista (it's always too hot), greets his security guard friend as they walk to the bank where they work, all while armed robberies, car chases, helicopter crashes etc. Are going on around them. And thisis not odd, because Guy is an NPC - a non-playable character - in the online videogame Free City. He is essentially walking scenery, programmed with a specific set of behaviour. But then he starts to wonder where there might be more to life, and notices a girl (wearing sunglasses, indicating there is a real person behind her although Guy doesn't know this) and things begin to get interesting.All the above is made clear in the trailer, and there is a great deal of fun to be had from Guy breaking out of his programming and discovering the consequences of being in a videogame. But there is a whole additional plot going on which carries some genuine drama on at least two plotlines, adding weight to what would otherwise be a fun but silly piece.Ryan Reynolds' air of affable geniality with a touch of hunk suits Guy perfectly. The film has a great story (especially for games and nerds generally), is often very funny, has fantastic special effects and also a surprising amount of heart. Plus there is a great call-out to - never mind, I really don't want to spoil it.",Free Guy
12,Mr-Fusion,Easygoing and surprisingly deep,7,6 November 2021,"Full disclosure, I walked into Free Guy with guarded apprehension. It's GTA online, ""buy more Disney!"" generic gamer culture - all of which I've had my share.But it's a Ryan Reynolds movie, and that means an inherent affability; I ain't immune. Plus, there's the anti-corporate greed aspect of the story - I had no chance. Most of the jokes landed, the world is visually inviting and I easily enjoyed myself.I also have to give it credit for a novel (read: hilarious) cameo. I won't spoil it but it's a great one.",Free Guy
13,siderite,Ready Player One has a baby with Deadpool,7,30 September 2021,"I liked the nostalgia and love and effort that was put in Ready Player One, the book. The film was really bad in comparison. And I loved Deadpool, as a satirical middle finger to franchised superhero formulas, but then they did the sequel, because formulaic Deadpool brought money. So when I review Free Guy I am both expressing my satisfaction regarding the seed idea and the disappointment that it never went where it could have gone. Long story short, the film is long, formulaic and only occasionally funny. All the fresh bits were in the trailers and the rest was over the top filler and CGI.I couldn't care less how many celebrity friends come and cameo in your film, nor do I care about the silly faces that you can make if the story is simplistic and most of your movie is video game special effects rendered better. This could have been much more than a real life adaptation of a Lego movie, but you settled!Bottom line: at two hours long, I felt that it lasted forever. It is entertaining, but a requirement to enjoying the film is to turn off your brain completely. Some cameos and hat tips are funny, I give you that, but the concept is already old and tired while the video game references feel from the time Ryan Reynolds spent time on Counter Strike and Second Life and WoW. I will rank this average, but in my heart I know that it is a failure.",Free Guy
14,thesar-2,Ready Better Player,8,5 September 2021,"AND I did get it for free. Thanks, Shane!My Dad had the BEST time during this movie. And he's even a tougher critic than myself. He will love a movie and still only give it 3.4/5 stars. He gave this one 4.5/5 stars. That alone, is the biggest recommendation for this movie. So, SEE IT!But, since this is my review/thoughts, I'll continue. I liked it too. There were a TON of other movies going through my mind while watching this, such as The Lego Movie, the first Black Mirror episode I saw: Bandersnatch, Gamer, Ready Player One, Wreck-It Ralph, The Truman Show, (of course) Deadpool and so many more. So, if you liked any/all of those, this is for you.""Guy"" is a NPC or Non-Player Character inside a videogame but may be destined for more. When he meets the girl of his dreams - an actual player, parts of him evolve. And not just down below. She, on the other Hand, needs his help proving the game should belong to her.While Ryan Reynolds almost 100% embodies his Deadpool character with Guy, he's really making it PG, which was kinda nice. Don't get me wrong: I LOVE Deadpool and its hard-R. I wouldn't have it any other way. But, it's nice to see another side of him that's not fully adult. Like this could be shown to young kids without any worry.It's a fun adventure with absolute heart. The love triangle is really touching and the humor, mostly from Reynolds, is refreshing. He's really loving life in his roles and it's nice to see.So, I agree with Dad. SEE IT!***Final Thoughts: That all said...boy this seemed to really be more geared to gamers. I am not one, but I play a little of them, so I got the gist. Mostly, I loved the references in this to Portal, which is probably my all-time favorite Xbox game. I've completed the 1st one twice and 2nd one once and I can't wait to do it all over again.",Free Guy
15,cherold,terrifically fun and funny,8,23 October 2021,"I love this movie about a GTA world in which an NPC develops consciousness. It combines wild humor and crazy stunts and stars Ryan Reynolds and Julie Comer are terrific.The only real issue I have with this movie is the weakness of ""real world"" parts. The humans seem less fleshed out than the NPCs and Taika Waititi's was a lazy, shallow caricature. Maybe that was the point - the computer characters are realler than the real people - but if so it's the sort of point people make when they're really stoned.Still, the movie is 90% in the game and that's all wonderful. If not for a few weaknesses here and there I would have given this a 9 even though it's essentially just a very silly action comedy (although a very clever one).You should definitely watch this.",Free Guy
16,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"That's not how video-games work, my guy.",4,2 October 2021,"'Free Guy (2021)' feels as though it's been made by people who have never actually played a video-game. It's the cinematic equivalent of those pre-rendered mobile game adverts that pretend to present gameplay but don't actually represent the game they're trying to sell at all. Though there are a couple of interesting ideas centred around the A. I. that makes Reynold's Guy able to go against his code, the piece just doesn't do anything with them. It doesn't really make sense and there's no semblance of cohesion or believability to the game that makes up most of its runtime. I mean, who is 'Free City' for and what do you do in it? It's not PvP from the looks of it, but everyone freaks out when an NPC actually presents a challenge to a player. God forbid a player gets killed by an enemy in a game, right? However, the fact that it lacks a proper sense of logic isn't its biggest issue, although it is undeniably irritating that a movie which is supposed to celebrate video-games clearly doesn't understand them and also partakes in the kind of banal 'gamer' stereotyping that perforates pretty much every piece of traditional media about the subject. No, the biggest issue is that, for me, it simply isn't fun. It's quite the opposite, usually. The amount of cringeworthy moments are nearly innumerable and its message is incredibly hypocritical considering that it lambasts big-budget games which are fuelled by mindless chaos and exist only to make money from a target audience that their developers clearly don't respect but it's a big-budget movie which is fuelled by mindless chaos and exists only to make money from a target audience that its creators clearly don't respect. Ryan Reynold's on-screen persona, which is essentially the same in every comedic film in which he appears, is also incredibly annoying and does the opposite of elicit laughter. There are some relatively impressive visual effects - even though nothing feels tangible and one or two are actually rather disturbing - and there are a couple of action sequences which are relatively well put together. However, the overall experience is just dull, despite all of its in-your-face noise. It's just such a corporate attempt, a movie designed by committee. It also has some incredibly disconcerting fan service, the sort that seems to be replacing actual content more and more these days. Sadly, a lot of people seem to be lapping it up. Of course, if you enjoy this film, then good for you; I'm not saying you shouldn't. I'm simply saying I don't. Despite the occasional highlight, it's an uninteresting and uninspired affair overall. 4/10.",Free Guy
17,Edvis-1997,7,7,18 October 2021,"This movie is far away to be called flop. It's very decent and I can proudly say one of the best movie of 2021 so far. I liked the idea, something about The Sims, Elon Musk theory and everything else blended together and boom, we have great content. Good to see new actors and professionals working together. Tbh, I was thinking give it 7 or 8 but ending wasn't as strong as whole movie so I decided to stick with 7. It's in my top 10 of this year. Strongly recommended.",Free Guy
18,ericstevenson,A great movie for everyone!,9,29 August 2021,"This is what do you know? A movie based on an original idea! The premise is that Blue Shirt Guy is an NPC in a video game and comes to realize that he's a video game character. He falls in love with a real life person in the game who's trying to find evidence that the real life creator of the video game stole his idea from them. The best part is easily the ending, because you find yourself so rooting for this character. Ryan Reynolds is absolutely amazing.The funny thing is that the beginning with more of the action is the weaker half! We get into a ton of great character development as the film goes on and we get a great sense of being in another world. This earned its PG-13 rating and would have been rated R if they had just made the scenes bloodier. I think it's better than something like ""Ready Player One"" because it doesn't just rely on pop culture references for jokes. It had a lot more of an original feel to it, which is rare nowadays. Please check out this funny, smart and emotional movie! ***1/2.",Free Guy

21,atlasmb,One Of The Year's Best,10,29 August 2021,"With plot points that are reminiscent of ""The Truman Show"", ""Pleasantville"", ""The Matrix"", ""Groundhog Day"", ""Wreck-it Ralph"" , the video game ""Grand Theft Auto"", among others, you might think that this film feels derivative. But the film is so imaginative, so fresh, so creative, that it never feels that way.Ryan Reynolds stars as Guy, a background character in a GTA-styled game who doesn't realize he lives in an unreal world (for a very clever reason that I won't mention here). He meets a player-drive character (played by Jodie Comer) and his life changes. Lil Rel Howery plays Buddy, Guy's best friend.We have seen better displays of CGI, but this film has a plot that complex, yet easy to follow. Creating the film, with its levels of graphics, real action, and effects must have been extraordinarily complicated. It all pays off, because it is so much fun to watch. Repeated viewing will doubtlessly reveal more of the complexity.Reynolds is perfect as the golly-gee innocent who feels stirrings of consciousness. And Comer captures the absurd-yet-believable concept of the real woman who might be falling for an NPC.",Free Guy
22,westsideschl,An Insight into Gaming,10,4 November 2021,"A quick guide to the movie's gaming background: In this movie we see a small group of programers tweaking an online game where people create their avatars (called their skin) to play against other people's avatars. Also, in this shootout fest are NPCs (non-playable characters) that seem real to us, but they're just programmed to be robotic background characters. Our main character is a NPC bank teller (called blue shirt guy; BSG) who through special glasses gains access to the non-real world he lives in, but in doing so his code now becomes self aware (i.e. AI or artificial intelligence) & begins to alter the game's code. The avatars gain points (money) by killing or picking up items. After so much money you ""level up"" - you're more powerful or gain access to other areas to explore.An aside: Jodie Comer shows her versatility in a role quite distant from her ""Killing Eve"" disturbing character.Also, ball park 500 people were in visual effects & digital artistry for the film's CGI.",Free Guy
23,tabuno,Feed Good Movie of the Year,9,13 August 2021,"The feel-good movie of the year. This fusion of animated-live action rom-com where an unknowing fun loving video guy played by Ryan Reynolds finds himself in the battle to uncover an important secret of a corporate bad business guy in the real world that was hidden in the video game world. Jodie Comer, Emmy Award winner of television series ""Killing Eve"" (2018) fame co-stars in a delightful change of pace for her. Using heavy inspiration from the serious sci fi thriller Inception (2010)) and the superhero action figure of Dr. Strange (2016), Free Guy has a fresh and bright cast to a techno-plot filled with emotional twinges and exciting visual action effects. The unusual delay in Free Guy's revelation is deliciously prolonged. Free Guy did not just arrive on the scene without help, other movies helped pave the way to this refined but lavishly wildly out of the box version of the sci-fi techno movie, comedy-style including Tron (1982), Jim Carrey in The Truman Show (1998), Will Ferrell in Stranger than Fiction (2006), Bolt (2008), Sucker Punch (2011), My Holo Love (2020).

24,The-Sarkologist,When the Truman Show Meets the Lego Movie,6,11 October 2021,"One of the biggest problems with movies these days are trailers. I say that because, well, it sort of kills some of the massive twists that could make the film much better. For instance, having a twists that Guy happens to be an NPC in a online shootem-up would have been pretty good. Then again, I'm not entirely sure if it would have worked out all that well anyway considering that the plot ended up being pretty predictable, and that we were accused of spoilers when in reality we have just pretty much figured out what was going on.As the trailer points out, Guy happens to be this NPC in an online shootem-up, and he meets this character that he falls in love with. It turns out that the character is actually a PC, and in fact there is more to this character than meets the eye. The thing is that the world is going to be shut down because the company that is running the game wants to upgrade it to a new release, however, as I suggested, something has happened in this version which means they have to fight against having the game shut down.It was suggested that this film was a cross between The Truman Show, and The Lego Movie, with a number of other things thrown in as well. Actually, this whole idea of living within a world oblivious to the fact that people are watching you is very much like the Truman Show, except that since Guy happens to be an NPC, nobody really pays all that much attention to him, that is until he decides to start leveling up.This is the catch, because apparently NPCs aren't supposed to do that, only players, however he manages to get his hands on a pair of glasses that reveals the reality of the world around him. However, as I suggested, he actually isn't supposed to do that, so how is it that an NPC is not only able to kill a PC, but also steal the PC's glasses. Well, that comes out eventually, but the thing is that it is pretty easy to actually work out once you know what is going on.Still, I did rather like this film, even though it wasn't anything that was necessarily original. One thing that it does is that it explores the nature of reality, and also the nature of consciousness (which has probably given a little bit too much away). Then again, this film doesn't dig too much into many of these issues, namely because it is a fairly light hearted film. On the other hand, especially with regards to the nature of reality, there is a lot of Trumanesque in this film.I thought it was fun, and enjoyable, but then again it is Ryan Reynolds, and I don't mind the odd Ryan Reynolds film, though he can be a little dry at times. Mind you, the innocence of Guy, and also the fact that he goes around doing good in a game that is a less raunchy version of GTA, is rather interesting. Of course, watching all of the violence going on behind the scenes while the NPCs simply wander around isn't too bad, which does sort of sets it apart from the other movies that I have mentioned, however, I can't really say that it is all that original.Hey, at least the Lego Movie left the big reveal until right at the end.",Free Guy

26,Thanos_Alfie,Very funny...,7,27 September 2021,"""Free Guy"" is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we watch a bank teller understanding that he is an Non Playable Character in an action video game. After discovering that he tries to find out what is happening but more complicated things are about to happen.I liked this movie because it had a funny and interesting plot filled with clever gaming ideas and nice plot twists. The direction which was made by Shawn Levy was good and he presented very well both his main characters and the plot of his movie without creating any confusion with all the information needed. The interpretation of Ryan Reynolds who played as Guy was simply hilarious and he moves and acting reminded a little bit Deadpool. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Lil Rel Howery's who played as Buddy, Jodie Comer's who played as Millie / Molotovgirl, Joe Keery's who played as Keys and Taika Waititi's who played as Antwan. All in all, I have to say that ""Free Guy"" is a nice, interesting and entertaining movie to spend your time with but do not expect from it to be the new ""The Truman Show"" because it's not, it's something different.",Free Guy
27,cruise01,Lots of fun and Ryan Reynolds nails the humor and movie.,8,23 August 2021,4 out of 5 stars.Free Guy is a good action comedy film about a non player character Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who breaks away from his routine in a video game world. And tries to follow a girl played by Jodie Comer. Who has her own hidden agenda.Great plot. The film has a tone like Wreck it Ralph or Ready Player One. The film is a lot of fun. Has lots of big and loud action. And lots of fun humor that is driven by Ryan Reynolds.Great cast ensemble. The movie could have took more use of adding more soundtrack that could have worked. But has the bare minimum. The movie does have a lot of fun cameos which is funny. And other references to other franchises. Which made the movie great.,Free Guy
28,eddie_baggins,Some brilliant video game moments get lost in a trite story,5,19 August 2021,"There's been a long and storied history of bad video game movies, movies that tried to recapture the magic of pixelated form into something that was going to keep fans and newbies alike happy but for one reason or another failed in their mission to turn gaming greatness into a film of quality.In what is a major win for the film, Shawn Levy's Free Guy thankfully does an amazing job of capturing the video game magic that many gamers feel when they log into their game/system of choice and enter into a world that provides endless hours of entertainment and there's no denying that when Free Guy is focused more around its video game origins this is one of the most enjoyable Hollywood films of the season but sadly the film is lumped with a trite plot line that feels like a poor man's Truman Show, one that takes away from all the chaotic fun it had at its disposal.Creating yet another chance for its star Ryan Reynolds to bring out his Deadpool act for a more wider ranging audience, Free Guy see's the content to coast along actor bring NPC (non playable character) Guy to life as his happy go lucky bank teller finds out his idyllic yet repetitive life is in fact nothing but a program for a game he is only just made aware of and is very much a part of, its a familiar set up in a colorful and chaotic world yet while it roars along for the first act, Free Guy sadly becomes a lame and tiresome love/life affirming journey that in many instances is too preachy where it should have been pure sugar coated silliness.There's moments within the film that are exactly what the doctor ordered, Guy waltzing the streets for the first time with the game around him made alive or a hilarious fight with a quickly programed muscle clad opponent (""catchphrase"") are brilliantly staged and inventive but Guy's awkward romance with Jodie Comer's Molotov Girl/Millie is not what the film needed, especially when billed alongside the films insistence on providing life lessons or by somehow making Taika Waititi utterly unfunny and annoying as he gets little too do as the films shoehorned in villain Antwan.Never the most original of directors, you wish a director with more willingness to stray from the usual had perhaps brought Free Guy to life other than Levy, while the action and spectacle is all on point, there's something wrong with what Free Guy wants to be and what it ends up becoming, a mix of brilliant video game to life moments lost in a terrible story with a bunch of characters and happenings that are instantly forgettable.Final Say -A frustrating experience that does a lot right bringing the video game culture to cinema but also a lot poorly when it comes to story and characters, Free Guy has some fantastic components caught up in a generic ride that isn't worth a second thought.2 1/2 boiled turkeys out of 5.",Free Guy
29,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Dear Video Game Lovers, Here's your BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINER! Just pack in your video game for two hours and ""Don't Have a Good Time, Have A Great Time!""",7,23 September 2021,"Free Guy (2021) :
Brief Review -Dear Video Game Lovers, Here's your BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINER! Just pack in your video game for two hours and ""Don't Have a Good Time, Have A Great Time!"" I didn't expect this film to be so good, i mean this good that i never imagined i would be screaming in and out while writing this brief review. I am literally having a laugh and excitement right now when i eagerly want to recommend this Fun-tastic ride to you, to kids, to adults i mean everyone. A bank teller discovers that he's actually an NPC inside a brutal, open world video game. Yet, he has feeling because he's the first of its kind an Artificial intelligence game player. This connects emotions of viewers and love story to the real world and there's commercial scam to provide the negative side to fight off. Loved this idea and more than that i enjoyed the humour and spoofs of popular movie characters. That climax scene, the muscular replica, then Captain America's Shield and we see Chris Steven exclaiming, ""What is that?"" Too much fun. Thank god they didn't show Harrison Ford or Mark Hamill for that Star Wars spoof. There's much more apart from this but i don't wanna spoil your experience so watch it for yourself. Ryan Reynolds is funny, creamy and lovable as the lead character 'Guy'. I kinda liked this name too, 'Guy'.. Who are you? I am Guy. Still a 'Guy', he says. That's some brainstorming by the writer. Jodie Comer looks glamourous as Molotov, and as Millie too she's decent. Joe Kerry brings a much needed intelligent character while Taika Waititi gets you busy with the slapstick gags. Director Shawn Levy has got everything right as far as you're looking at it as an entertainer and believe me there's nothing wrong about it. It's a great popcorn flick and if you are a Video Game lover then it's even better. A special mention to the writer and screenwriter and before sign off, let me remind you that, ""Don't Have A Good Day, Have a Great Day"".RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",Free Guy

Gone is the excitement.",5,1 October 2021,"Deadpool was a huge hit, BUT not suited for families, because of it's R rating. Free Guy is nothing much more than a cleaned up, family oriented version, that can be watched by a younger audience as well, without any swear words, without any sexjokes, without any of the great, but R rated dialogues of Deadpool.The bad: the supporting kid actors have no charisma. They only hold up the story. More bad: this story is basically ""The Truman Show"" turned into a computer game.Not any good? It is a POPCORN movie. Loud music, many CGI effects, constant ""jokes"". It will please the masses. Ryan Reynolds is still good, but while watching this I still longed to see the superior Deadpool movie, with it's sparkling originality.",Free Guy
32,southdavid,Guy Fawkes him up.,7,16 August 2021,"Long delayed by Covid, and wisely (I think) hung on to for a big screen release, I feel like ""Free Guy"" is a good, if immediately forgettable, cinematic experience. For the second time this month, after ""The Suicide Squad"" I'm left with a film that I really really liked. . . But just don't quite love.Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a bank teller in the crazy, action packed town of Free City. Unbeknownst to him, he's actually a non-playable supporting character in a video game, there to be robbed, punched and killed to enhance the game for the human players. His life changes when he sees Molotov, the in game character used by Millie (Jodie Comer). Millie is searching the game for a secret area that has only ever been glimpsed by one other player and as she illuminates some of the rules of the game for Guy, he decides that it's time to fight back.I've not read anyone else's reviews yet, but I'd be surprised if ""The Lego Movie"" doesn't come up a few times, as, certainly in terms of premise, it's almost a live action version. A hero who doesn't quite fit in with the rules of his world, has his eyes opened to it by a feisty capable woman whom he immediately falls for. This is not meant as a criticism, just an observation. Much of the appeal of the movie may hinge on your appreciation of Ryan Reynolds, as his charm carries a lot of the film. That said, Comer has, for years, been on the brink of making the transition from TV to movie star and absolutely nails this role.I wish, perhaps they hadn't done the second trailer revealing the ""end of game"" boss, as although that section does have some more hidden secrets in it, had I not been aware that whole sequence was coming, then it may have tipped the film over the top for me. However, there were some other welcome surprises. The trailers have hidden how much Joe Keery is integral to the film's story and he, and the films love plot, were a pleasant surprise. Similarly, Channing Tatum is in the film more than initially it appears, and his role, mixed with his player, Matty Cardarple is another highlight. Finally, I really liked some of the attention to gaming detail, such as not scrubbing reflections being a plot point though I continued to flinch every time they paused this supposedly online game.Certainly, in the cinema, for the first time, it was an enjoyable experience, with enough funny lines and surprises to send me home happy. Whether I feel quite as positive about it on a second viewing seems unlikely though.",Free Guy

He wears the same clothes,buys the same coffee and does the same thing 24/7.

Speaking of the cast in this movie, I've always loved Ryan Reynolds since Just Friends,The Proposal and Deadpool.

What if the Non-Playable Character in a video game did not know he was a Non-Playable Character in a video game? Reminds me of Wreck-It Ralph but a little less magical (in the sense that the movie tells the story of the technical reason Free Guy is alive).It's a character straight up Ryan Reynolds alley, oddly enough Deadpool if toned down to one (and yet still worth watching).It just showcases the full aspect of gaming culture.

Ryan is an NPC-Non Player Character-in a video game called Free City. That means he is a background character that is usually ignored.

This movie is distributed by Disney so don't be surprised when you hear music-and more-from the Avengers and Star Wars franchises. One of the best cameos is with a character called 'Dude'.

38,alindsay-al,A Great Fun Film,8,23 August 2021,"This has been the most popular film in the world right now and today I found the time to watch Free Guy and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a NPC inside a video game slowly gain sentience.Main Character
Ryan Reynolds plays Guy and he does a good job in the role, yes it is a role we have seen him do plenty of times now but it fits him well and fits the film we are watching. Guy is a really likeable character, and you really feel sorry for him as his world truly gets turned upside down. It's a typical Ryan Reynolds character and for this it is a fun character.Supporting Characters
Jodie Comer is mostly known for her stint on Killing Eve, but it is really nice seeing her given a big role in a Hollywood film and she excels in the film. She basically plays two roles, her character in the game and her real life person and she is effective in both and both are very different. She is great in the action scenes and she has good chemistry with Reynolds. The rest of the cast are pretty good too, Taika Waititi plays the bad guy and it takes a while for him to show up but when he does he is pretty funny and as over the top cheesy bad guys go he does a good job. Lil Rel Howery plays Buddy who is Guy's best friend and I did like their friendship and how it develops during the film. Joe Keery plays Jodie Comer's partner and he is decent too but doesn't really stand out in this role as a whole because the real world stuff isn't as interesting as the stuff happening in the game world.Story
The story in the game world is really fun to watch, especially for people that play video games as it really feels geared towards that community which I am a part of. Seeing this one NPC gain awareness and everything that goes along with it is really entertaining and allows for some fun interactions. But there is no doubt that the real life story falls a bit flat and probably has too much screen time which does drag it along a bit.Script
The film is funny and has a surprising amount of heart. It doesn't really have the laugh out loud moment but has enough laughs in it to keep you amused and entertained. Then when the drama has to hit it does it effectively and tells you that there is a bit more depth to Free Guy.Style
The film looks great, the CGI flows very nicely and a video game world actually feels like a video game world which is so crucial to a film like this. The action is fun and exciting for sure, but there isn't really enough of it. The film drags in terms of its pacing, and feels like this could have been an even better film if the runtime was cut a little bit.Overall
Overall, Free Guy is one of the surprises of 2021 and a really enjoyable film. I think video game fans are gonna really enjoy this film but others will get a good kick out of it too.",Free Guy
39,henry8-3,Free Guy,4,31 August 2021,"Ryan Reynolds is Guy who doesn't realise he's a background player (NPC) in a violent video game owned by Taika Waititi who in fact stole much of its workings from Jodie Comer and Joe Kerry. Comer's avatar teams up with Guy and real Comer and Kerry unite to bring Waititi down.Big, loud and spectacular - this has some enjoyable set pieces and the 2 leads are engaging and deliver witty performances. It is though an unrestrained mess full of endless impressive effects that ultimately win out in the battle with the story which is pretty slight. Like a cross between Ready Player One and The Truman Show, but not as much fun and accessible as the first nor as touching or real as the latter.",Free Guy

41,kluseba,Entertaining action-adventure cinema on the pulse of time with valuable life lessons,8,27 October 2021,"Free Guy is an imaginative science-fiction adventure movie in the key of Ready Player One that should appeal to kids, teenagers and young adults who enjoy playing video games.The movie revolves around two parallel stories. In our real world, developers Walter McKey and his estranged partner Millie Rusk try to prove that selfish head developer Antwan Hovachelik has illegally used their source code to create a highly successful open-world video game. In said game, a non-player character named Guy develops an artificial intelligence when encountering a character named Molotov Girl who is actually Millie Rusk's game character. The two characters start working together in the game to find traces of the hidden source code that could benefit Millie Rusk and Walter McKey in real life.This film convinces on many levels. First of all, the movie has a vibrant mixture of multiple genres such as action, adventure, comedy, drama, romance and science-fiction. The special effects are outstanding and bring a video game to life in an imaginative way with numerous creative details and breathtaking settings. The two story lines are cleverly interwoven and deliver poignant messages against greed and for love. The acting performances are solid and especially Ryan Reynolds manages to give the lead character a sympathetic, quirky and funny personality.At the end of the day, Free Guy is an entertaining action-adventure movie on the pulse of time that can be enjoyed by children, teenagers and young adults as it teaches valuable life lessons. If you don't appreciate video games or if you were looking for a movie with more thrilling twists, you might however end up finding the movie too modern or too childish. There are also too many similarities between this film and Ready Player One in my opinion. While this film is certainly entertaining and memorable as there aren't too many of its kind yet, the under-appreciated Serenity is even more creative, mature and profound in the same genre.",Free Guy
42,Pairic,Fun Adventure,8,15 August 2021,"Free Guy: A film about A. I., the nature of reality and idealistic Game developers versus Big Business Game companies. Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is just another Non-Playing Character (NPC) in Free City, he's happy with his life, working in a bank that's robbed every day, seeing nothing odd with tanks in the streets, people being shot, on fire. He starts to develop consciousness, first asking for a different coffee, then reacting to someone wearing sunglasses (a player). This is Molotov Girl/Millie (Judie Comer), a developer whose AI design has been stolen by the evil Soonami Corporation who run the Free City game. Guy helps Millie in her attempts to gain proof of the steal in the process becoming famous to Gamers as Blue Shirt Guy. A tale of love as well as attaining sentience. At times though there is existential despair as Guy tries to convince his fellow characters that they are living in a simulation only to be struck by a vehicle. His exploits along with Millie are quite entertaining though as they battle Bond Villain style henchmen NPCs in their attempts to uncover secrets. Even a nod to The Greatest American Hero as Guy tries to master his powers which is followed up later by it's theme tune. A fun adventure which (like games) operates on several levels.

47,rgkarim,Freedom Never Made a Guy Feel So Much Fun,9,13 August 2021,"LIKES:Multilayered Plot:
Is it a comedy? Is it an action film? Is it a character spoof? It's a little bit of everything when it comes to this film and Penn and Lieberman have brought a lot of layers to a movie portrayed as mere stupid comedy. Guy's journey starts out going in one way as a comedy dive into one character's pursuit of a crush, but soon levels up into something much more than you can imagine. It juggles the genres quite well and keeps to the themes it lays down while gradually pushing new ideas into the mix that fit quite well and avoid getting too preachy or lost in the platforms they start to slide in to the tale.The Character Development:
Beneath all the gimmicks, laughs, and goofy adventures, is surprisingly some better character development than I had thought capable of this movie containing. Secondary characters like Buddy (Lil Rel Howery), Antoine (Taika Waititi) and Mouser (Utkarsh Ambudkar) get some decent dives into their character arcs and inclusion in the film to make them relevant additions to the cast. While Keys (Joe Keery), Millie (Jodie Comer)and Guy (Ryan Reynolds) get a very closer look at their lives and evolve past the avatars and jobs they hold in this movie. Once more included in the plot without interrupting the main theme, the planning for these characters is super fun and engrosses the audience into caring about the characters in this bizarre game.The Action Fits With the Theme:
Something that a lot of Reynolds recent movies do, is accomplishing the action part of the film without losing touch with the other themes of the movie. While nothing over the top, unique, or even mind blowing, Free Guy's action scenes continue to be super fun and funny as the chaos of Free City's urban Wild West unfolds around Guy. It takes the slapstick and physical humor with the witty, manic jokes of Reynolds and somehow fuses them together to actually have a little adventure to them found in an MMO. This led to very enjoyable levels that made the me laugh in surprise at what was coming out next.The Easter Eggs:
If you've read my previous reviews, you know I like looking for Easter eggs in movies and the references they may hold. Free Guy holds plenty of treasures for the reference hunters like me, some quite obvious and used in the writing, and others like Ready Player One that require multiple watches to find them all. It's a fun little addition to an already enjoyable movie and executed super well when incorporated as small devices to move the action along. I leave you to find what lies in this tale for later.Acting:
Yep, I like the acting and many of the recruited players for this comedy have done their characters proudly from this reviewer's perspective. Keery as the nerd with a heart of gold offers a love letter to the beauty and the beast like story we all are suckers for enjoying. Waititi takes his usual flavor of flamboyant personalities and once more curtails a character that is over the top, loud, and highly entertaining that he plays so well. Reynolds Guy is a nice hybrid of characters that has become his bread and butter, naïve and innocent, a heavy dose of sarcasm, and plenty of humor to flood out of his mouth for all to enjoy. It may seem like a big Deadpool knock off, but Guy has been curtailed a little more towards the friendlier and charming spectrum of personality and I loved seeing this side as it did not overtake the other elements of the movie I enjoyed so much. Yet the winner of this movie for me goes to the lovely Jodie Comer. Her character had the most avenues to cover and seeing those facets unfold in this movie was quite an enjoyable experience at seeing her execution of the strong central lead. She and Reynolds had great chemistry together and I loved seeing the battling qualities of her character as real life and virtual reality contests for dominating her life.Fun and Funny
The selling point for the movie though is the humor and fun to be had with all the antics that Reynolds and crew can bring up. It moves well once Guy starts to challenge the nature he has been used to and takes the momentum to new heights to start incorporating many styles of humor into the adventure. Clumsy slapstick works for many laughs as Guy continues to become accustomed to the Sunglass wearers lives, having serendipity and luck help him perform feats no one was expecting. Fantastically timed cursing and jokes are stitched into the sea of quotable moments of naivety that left my sides hurting as they cut to players trying to understand what was going on. Cutting from a player just before a tantrum offered some indirect interactions with the NPC, and I loved that same witty, coy and energetic stupidity that Reynolds always brings to the table. With enough outlets to let the humor rest, the movie accomplishes being fun like the trailers promised and maintaining good quality.DISLIKESPredictable:
No surprise here, but the movie holds little surprises in terms of mind blowing moments that will have you questioning their origins. Though it barely matters with all the fun you will be having, Free Guy is not for those looking for a higher calling or mind twist that other films have accomplishedNeeded More Legendary Player Involvement:
For a world that is as popular as Free City, you would expect there to be more than two legendary players that roam the streets. MMOs are known for creating celebrities and I for one would have loved to have had some jokes and jabs thrown at the topic of super star players that the world has exploded with in the last few years. Sure, one player does have a great interaction, and I enjoyed the real life and digital counterpart involvements that added another comedy style to the hand, but a few others could have been introduced and included in the story to help keep the adventure running, and really help the ending along a little further.More Action:
While the action was again fun and fitting to the comedy theme of the film, I felt they only scratched the surface of the ingenuity we saw in some of the fights. The references and integration of props to the mayhem offered more opportunities for other easter eggs to be laid and could have amplified the epic encounters to new heights if they had gotten more licenses to use. I'm guessing they wanted to cut expenses, but I feel there was more to unlock in this game then what we got. In addition, a little more action could have also added a touch of suspense to the mix as well, again primarily at the end where the final push of his quest was just starting to heat up.The VERDICT:
Overall, Free Guy surprised me by how much I enjoyed the film given my expectations from the trailers. Certainly it's a ridiculous comedy at the heart, filled with jokes, skits, and antics that will leave many in the theater laughing at how well Reynolds continues to make being a naïve fool fun to be. It breaks up things quite well, allowing for rest to keep things fun, but never diverting from the pace too much to lose sight of the overall adventure. It's clever use of easter eggs in and out of combat, alongside fun performances makes for a good cast to latch onto and ride the chaos through in the crazy town of Free City. Surprisingly, the movie is deeper though, and with the morals, issues, and characters they developed, the extra layers really do help make this movie sparkle and not just be another Deadpool clone that many expected it to be. I admit there is enough similarities and limitations to grant it Deadpool copying, given the joke presentation, the manic vomiting of joke after joke hitting the screen and the similarities in pacing. I'll also admit that there was still more cleverness to be held in the coding of the movie, but either budget or time got in the way leaving me wishing for a little more exploration and involvement of other players in this massive open world. Still, the film is certainly fun and I would state this one is a theater visit given the special effects, adventure, and deeper levels lying for those bold enough to give it a try.My scores for the film are:Action/Comedy/Sci-Fi: 8.5 - 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0.",Free Guy
48,rannynm,"Interesting concept, terrific acting and special effects",8,14 August 2021,"Free Guy is a movie with a very interesting concept and actors that execute it perfectly. The movie is humorous and had me and the people I was with, laughing the entire time. But, once you get to the bottom of it, you'll realize there's a lot more to Free Guy than the humor.Free Guy is about a video game character named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who discovers that he's just a background player in a game called Free City. When he finds a pair of sunglasses that changes his status in the game, he becomes all anyone can talk about. Even Millie (Jolie Comer), also known as Molotov Girl in Free City, is starting to fall for him. With all the fuss about Guy, Keys (Joe Keery) and Millie realize they can use him to their advantage to expose Antoine (Taika Waititi). However, since their secret is hidden within the game, they are going to need a little help.Free Guy has a lot of star power, which is one factor that will attract a lot of people. Many celebrities with very big fan bases make cameo appearances in this film. Towards the end of the film, Free Guy takes another opportunity to appeal to different audiences. For example, in the final battle scene, Guy uses different weapons that crossover with franchises such as Marvel and Star Wars. The characters in Free Guy are likeable and some are also relatable. My favorite character is Antoine. He is a lot funnier than most antagonists and he is the character that actually lightens the mood of the film. The way he banters with people and bosses everyone around makes him a character you want more from. The special effects in Free Guy are also a prominent component of the film. Free City is a game that was redesigned by Antoine to be repetitive, with a lot of damage taking place in everyday life. Every day there is another car being blown up, or a bank being robbed. Most of the time, it's both. So, major props to everyone in special effects, because it must have taken a lot of effort and time to make it look so realistic.The message of Free Guy is that you need to make sure you enjoy the simple things in life. For a regular person, life can be pretty repetitive if you let it. So when you do something out of the ordinary, make sure you recognize and appreciate it. Free Guy executes the double meaning subtly through the characters and their actions, which is very clever. This movie does include heavy use of profanity, which sometimes can be gratuitous, so parents should be aware of that.Free Guy is a unique film that will appeal to a lot of people, especially gamers. I rate Free Guy 4 out 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18. Free Guy releases in theatres August 13, 2021. Make sure you check it out!By Maica N., KIDS FIRST!",Free Guy
49,justin-fencsak,This movie is must see during a weak summer for movies. Very original.,10,22 September 2021,If you like video games comedy and action then you'll love Free Guy. This movie came out of nowhere to have legs and make moolah.,Free Guy
50,Kingslaay,It had its moments,6,2 October 2021,"Free Guy is an enjoyable film to watch, it was full of fun moments. Ryan Reynolds seems to have carved out a successful niche for himself with these comedic roles with somewhat serious undertones. I think this film would have struck a chord with gamers, seeing the blurring of real and fantasy world. I quite enjoyed the marvel and Star Wars references towards the end and there was a very decent soundtrack.",Free Guy
51,vengeance20,Alright. But Overrated.,4,16 August 2021,"Thought this looked alright, but was in 2 minds as to whether I should go see it or not as it did look some what weird & wacky.The film follows Guy, an NPC (Non Playable Character) living a controlled life in Free City (A Game Universe) in a Video Game under the same name. It is then that Guy starts to break free from the programmed life he's been living & starts to develop his own actions, feelings etc. However, he, the people & the whole city are under threat from permanent deletion as the game's sequel is going to take over & eradicate the original game, Guy must then fight to escape before he's pixels.I found the film, story wise & graphics wise pretty good, not to mention unique & different, well it mean it did after watching suddenly occur to me that it was a modern version of The Truman Show, the concept was the same & similar. There's plenty of action scenes, eye candy & some interesting rom-com stuff going on.However, the treatment of men in this film was bad, not to mention the snide dialogue added in for good measure from Hollywood as with films of this day & age typically do, it was highly unnecessary & uncalled for. Not to mention the stereotypes & cliches regarding gamers & of course, the runtime at 108 minutes & the pacing being too long.Aside from that it was alright, but nothing amazing. I'd say it's pretty overrated for what it is & not exactly a great film.4/10.",Free Guy
52,jellopuke,Half of a good movie,5,16 August 2021,"Parts of this were okay, with a few good gags and a premise that had potential, but it's overloaded with stupidity, needless youtuber and twitch streamer cameos, and a plot that isn't followed through on.

56,martimusross,Just About A Bearable Watch For 12 Year Old Boys,6,12 August 2021,"Free GuyThis was a secret screening at Cineworld and overall it wasn't too bad once I had found my inner child.Written for 12 to 14 year old boy gamers this script was incredibly lightweight. Basically is was Ryan Reynolds playing a game character that started behaving beyond his programming, apparently this was meant to indicate the emergence of artificial intelligence, however my robot vacuum goes rogue so explain that lol! We then had an overlaying story of game developers in the real world who had had their work stolen by an evil game company owner, who was more irritating than evil!I must say I was alienated by a crass joke about white privileged in the first 10 minutes, but I moved on!I remember two or indeed three movies that had a very similar plot line, Wreck It Ralph was the most similar. If it had not been for Ryan Reynolds this movie would have been a turkey but this man turned on the endearing charm, as for Jodie Comer it was Villanelle all over again and even the same three faces, personally she was miscast as we needed a more zany character.Overall it's a weak 6 out of 10 from me, meaning bland instantly forgettable contrived teenage dross, however it passed an evening emerging from a global pandemic!",Free Guy
57,thekarmicnomad,Great fun but misses a few tricks and is a little too desperate to be super nice.,7,25 September 2021,A character in a computer game breaks free from his programming when he sees a gamer.This is really god fun. I watched it with my girlfriend and we both loved it. It has action and romance and comedy and some in-game jokes.I know this is a main stream movie but I think they could have made more of the video game without alienating people.Like explain that Free Guy is good because he has no connection lag.Rather than people dodging bullets they should get shot and lose health.The film struggles to push a moralistic ideal that doesn't quite fit - it wants to have its cake and eat it.It has these great action set pieces but then suggests glorifying violence is bad.It wants to show gamers as diverse but also lean heavily on the sad toxic male gamer stereotype.The message about stopping violence and being kinder is nice but doesn't add up.The idea of a game where you don't play you just watch characters develop already exists - it is called life. Just open your front door and step outside.Once freed what are the characters to do?Whatever they like.Yeah but specifically what are you going to do?Err... drink coffee?Wow!A good fun movie that was really enjoyable but felt like it was trying too hard to take a moralistic high ground it really didn't need to.,Free Guy
58,aciessi,NPCinema,5,21 August 2021,"Free Guy is Wreck-It-Ralph meets The Truman Show. At the same time, it's premise is surprisingly inspired and well conceived as you walk through the movie. On paper, this is a Hollywood hit, and for the majority of the film, Free Guy is a fun time. It just doesn't have the same naughty, nutso energy as the Deadpool movies and I think it needed it, especially with Ryan Reynolds at the helm.",Free Guy
59,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A fun movie about video games with some extremely subtle and powerful messages.,8,12 October 2021,"This pandemic has messed with my sense of time. I could have sworn that Free Guy (2021) had already come out, but it had just been endlessly delayed until this year. As someone who enjoys video games, I was hesitant to watch this movie because it could be filled with too many references that would immediately date it. Fortunately, I was surprised by the few glimpses of a deeper plot hidden behind Free Guy's goofy exterior. Of course, Ryan Reynolds makes this movie work with his best PG-13 Deadpool impression.Within the first three minutes of this film, I thought to myself, ""Oh, this is just The LEGO Movie (2014)."" A non-player character (NPC) named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) breaks out of the mundanity of his existence to go on a great video game adventure. It wasn't until much later in the film that I realized the major plot points of The Truman Show (1998) were influencing the climax. Still, using a Grand Theft Auto-like video game to explore what it means to play (or live life) without violence is perhaps too subtle to be noticed by most.The few qualms I have with this movie come from how video games are created and run. I felt the ""big ticking clock"" that drives the plot is completely bogus because video games don't cease to work when a sequel comes out. Sure, there might be a dip in the number of players of an online game, but there are still users of previous versions of a franchise, regardless. Despite this huge and glaring plot hole, Free Guy was a fun movie filled with just enough video game references (a la Ready Player One (2018)) not to be dated but also pay homage to its origins.A fun movie about video games with some extremely subtle and powerful messages, I give Free Guy 4.0 stars out of 5.",Free Guy

Guy works at the bank & one day he realizes, that he's a non-playable character in a violent open world video game.Free Guy is an awe-inspiring film. Director Shawn Levy has given us a movie that is original & super fun to watch, in today's age of adaptations, sequels, prequels & spin-offs. The action set pieces are unique & unforgettable. The comedic elements will make you laugh raucously. This film has a ton of heart & makes you care about the main characters. Look out for quite a few memorable cameos. Ryan Reynolds is spectacular as Guy. Jodie Comer is outstanding as Millie/Molotovgirl. Lil Rel Howery is brilliant as Buddy. Joe Keery is superb as Keys. Utkarsh Ambudkar is amazing as Mouser. Taika Waititi is mind-blowing as Antwan. The supporting cast is great. Free Guy is a must watch for pretty much everyone. Really uplifts your mood, during these dark times we live in.",Free Guy
62,bankofmarquis,Wonderful - and Family Friendly!,8,5 September 2021,"Like most of us, when I first saw the trailer for the Ryan Reynolds comedy, FREE GUY (well over a year ago), I thought this looked like a bad ""money grab"" that will quickly come and go.But after it premiered earlier this summer, buzz started to grow - and a few people that I trust recommended it to me, so I decided to check it out.And...I'm glad I did for FREE GUY is a fun, family-friendly romp with a charismatic Ryan Reynolds anchoring a strong cast in a surprisingly heart-felt film.Directed by Shawn Levy (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM), Free Guy tells the story of an NPC (Non-Playable Character in a video game) that becomes sentient.In the capable hands of Director Levy and actor Reynolds, Guy (his character) is charming, earnest and likeable - a trio of qualities that is hard to pull off, but Levy and Reynolds walk this fine line very well, making Guy a character to root for. They wisely steer away from this character becoming cloying and annoying and just keep him charming and sincere.This is do-able because Levy and screenwriters Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn wisely choose to not make Guy the emotional center of this film, but rather, Guy is the catalyst who moves the plot (and the other characters) towards their final destinations - all the while keeping Guy (basically) the same. A very smart move that has been used in other, successful films (most notably Michael J. Fox in the BACK TO THE FUTURE FILMS).Jodie Comer (Killing Eve) and Joe Keery (Stranger Things) are a the heart of this film as 2 video game designers that are trying to find proof that their code was stolen by a heartless Video Game mogul (broadly, comically played by Taika Waititi). Both Comer and Keery are pleasant in their roles and they play off of Waititi (and his chief henchman, played with specific focus - this is a compliment - by Utkarsh Ambudkar). Comer and Keery make it easy for the audience to root for them and Waititi and Ambdukar make it easy for the audience to root against them.Credit for all of this goes to Director Levy. This film has the same feel as NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM. It doesn't try to do too much, makes the motivations of the good guys and the bad guys very simple to understand and then drops in the variable (Guy) to mix things up - all done with wit, simplicity and charm - a pretty easy combination, that often gets lost in the machinations, but Levy avoids this trap very, very well.Finally, I have to point out the performance of Lil Rel Howery as Guy's buddy...named...Buddy. He is the perfect ""Best Friend"". Again, Directed to a simple and direct performance by Levy, not trying to be more than he is, but ends up being a character you care about and root for.A winning combination of Director, Actors and material, FREE GUY isn't going to win any Oscars, but it is going to do something that very few films these days do - provide entertainment for the entire family.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Free Guy

64,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Fortnite becomes a movie,6,24 September 2021,"Ryan Reynolds is an NPC (Non Playable Character) in a game that is very much a live-action clone of the popular Fortnite game. Ryan's character is a bank teller that becomes self-aware and begins to breakout of the confines of his NPC role in the game. After a chance encounter with Millie, a pretty female Avatar, He falls head over heels for Millie, an Avatar played by a real player in this fantasy game. He begins to learn how to level up in the game so that he can impress her and be with her.The film has many funny scenes with Reynolds and some drama were he has become a intelligent AI within the game. But now the developers want to release a second version of the game that isn't backward compatible with version 1. This puts Reynolds virtual life in jeopardy because his algorithm will not be compatible with the updated version of the game. Once they shutdown the old version 1 servers, that's it for Reynolds and all of the other characters.Anyway, this is a fun movie for the younger crowd. It doesn't have a fully developed story but it doesn't matter here. They turned a popular video game like Fortnite and turned it into a life action world on screen. I think the kids will love it. Many of the characters from this film version of the game seem almost completely lifted from the actual video game.",Free Guy

68,Snootz,Almost well-done,5,24 September 2021,"The movie itself was rather well-done as far as base premise and special effects. The story was interesting (if a bit cliche- *cough* TRON *cough*), and the execution was generally well-done.Unfortunately the language accompanied by a couple of semi-raunchy scenes pulls this out of the ""family film"" slot it could have easily offered (and been just as good) and pushed it considerably into the realm of goofy-but-not-funny. The ""humor"" in this falls considerably short (I don't recall even chuckling during the entire film).It's the ""now generation"" attempt that drops this film from a potential top slot into category stupid, and from a film one might highly recommend to basic meh. It will probably be enjoyed by (some) gamers and adrenaline junkies, but for non-gamers, people beyond their teens, and those who aren't fans of nerdball humor, it's not likely to score points. While the scenery and special effects are certainly eye-candy, the movie as a whole doesn't come close to Ready Player One.",Free Guy
69,wetmars,Catchphrase.,10,18 August 2021,"What to say on this one? It was extremely enjoyable. I loved Guy's wonderful & romantic chemistry between him and the Molotov girl. You had cameos of well-known gamers. Ninja, I do have my respect for him since he hasn't done anything wrong/bad. Pokimane. Big yikes for her. I don't have to explain why she's bad. I have done my research on her, and it's just too much to comprehend. For Jackseptieye. I have my complete respect for him. He always seems like a chill dude and hasn't done anything wrong/bad. I always watched him play simple games like FNAF, Plague Inc, Surgeon Simulator & Slender, etc. And for DanTDM, I (again) do have complete respect for him. The same explanation for Jack also goes here. I mainly watched him for his Dr. Trayaurus stuff. With that away.This has to be one of the best video game movies ever made. The concepts were absolutely original, hilarious humor, well-paced, the writing & directing are top-notch, action-packed, the characters are well-done, and the storyline was quite interesting. What I do have a problem with this is Taika Waititi's role. He didn't fit well within the movie. The cast is strong at performance. I do appreciate the understanding of gaming culture. If you didn't know, Disney confirmed that they officially want a sequel.Best film of 2021, so far.10/10.",Free Guy
70,kjproulx,Just a Really Fun Movie to Watch,7,19 August 2021,"Movies based on video games haven't had the best representation, to say the least, but when you're talking about films that are literally about a video game as the film itself, sometimes that actually works really well. I enjoyed Ready Player One and I even have a soft spot for the film Gamer. Free Guy is now playing in theatres and it's the latest film to do just that. While this movie is far from perfect and I even rolled my eyes a few times, I had a blast watching it. It may just be the fact that when a movie strives to just be fun and it ends up accomplishing that task, I always feel satisfied. Here's why, even with its issues, Free Guy is worth seeing.The premise is as simple as this; a background character in a video game called Free City begins to think for himself and realizes he's fake, just as the game may possibly wipe out any chance he has at developing further. Played zanily by Ryan Reynolds, his character of Guy begins to fall in love with a real-world player. Flashing back and forth constantly from the real world to the game, this movie finds a nice balance of the two. In particular, I really enjoyed the character Keys, played by Joe Keery. The subplots involving the coders of Free City were one of the best aspects. Where this film won me over on multiple occasions though, was with its cameos.I won't ruin any of the cameos for those who are unaware, but this film is almost genius at times for how they find ways of bringing in other celebrities. For the few split seconds that certain actors are on screen, I was laughing very hard. Most of the cameos are played for jokes, but they also served as solutions for the story overall. For that, I really admired the fact that they were able to get all these people to appear. Free Guy does not hold back in terms of references, but it never feels like too much. They ride the very fine line nicely.On top of all the talent on-screen, director Shawn Levy has been someone who has nearly always impressed me behind the scenes. Sure, films like Cheaper by the Dozen, The Pink Panther, and Night at the Museum are not great movies by any means, but I find charm in all of his efforts. It was when Real Steel hit theatres though that I really started to notice him evolving as a filmmaker. That film still remains my favourite of his work and I also really enjoyed his more dramatic turn with the film This is Where I Leave You. After now seeing Free Guy, I can't wait to see what he works on next.Overall, Free Guy rides the line of being too corny almost the entire way through, and even when it seems like it's pushing it too far, it always pulled back. I took this film as meant to be nothing but a fun time at the theatre and that's exactly what it was. Yes some of the references are a bit much at times and I did find some of the secondary characters to be pointless, but the majority of the film is just plain fun. I even enjoyed the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer. If you're looking to just sit back and have two hours of fun at the movies, Free Guy deserves some love.",Free Guy

First of all the casts were all great. Ryan Reynolds was again funny and charismatic as himself. Taika Waititi was awesome playing a ridiculously looking villain. I bet that these guys enjoyed playing these wild characters.The movie created a lot of fun on the screen. The visual effects were great and reflected how the game worked. The best was probably when characters in the game pull out weapons. Towards the end, the movie became wilder and more ridiculous. Many references to other games or franchises and streamers were included, which added more comedy. Also, I liked the clever usage of people in real world playing characters in game, which made actors do and say some funny stuff. Lastly, There were quite a lot of explosions and actions, which added more to the experience at the theater.There was a romance between two characters, and while there's some smart twist to it, at the end it was a bit cheesy.Overall, awesome cast and a fun and dynamic movie experience. 8/10.",Free Guy

Superb acting from the entire cast, namely Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer, and jaw-dropping cameos genuinely elevate the overall experience. Honestly, it might be the very first movie to prove that Disney owning every major studio also has its perks.

76,SoumikBanerjee25,Goes Way Deeper than You Might Think,8,30 September 2021,"Right off the bat, I must admit; Free Guy is one of the best movies based on Simulation/Video Games that I have ever laid my eyes on!Truth be told, I wasn't anticipating anything from it; but man! Wasn't this one of those darn good surprises! Not perfect by any means, but an incredible demonstration nevertheless.From the surface, this could easily be labeled as a movie meant for a younger audience; teenagers in particular. And you know what? That presumption itself, it's as wrong as it gets. Let me tell you, It's much more than a mainstream entertainer! Free Guy's core concept goes way deeper than you could realize. Believe it or not, the innuendoes of several social matters are pretty prominent here.Even if we keep aside all the real-world propensities; the film offers a lot of other stuff to have a good time with. For instance, the visuals are indeed a pleasure to the sore eyes. Characters are well written, and more importantly; they do have substantial depths in each of them.The cast is unprecedented, and so is everyone's performance here. Which by the way in my understanding is the driving force behind. To start with, Ryan Reynolds being Ryan Reynolds for the umpteenth time, but it never gets old. Frankly speaking, I can't dislike this 'Guy' (Pun intended). His pairing with Lil Rel Howery might have not come up as strong as they wanted it to, yet I relished the screentime they share.Jodie Comer, Joe Keery work great together as this Video Game innovator duo, so does their friend Utkarsh. Taika Waititi might have overdone a bit in a few of his sequences, but hey I adored whatever that he has done. And that Channing Tatum Cameo though, that was some unexpected brilliance I must say.Lastly, I will put it like this; it doesn't make a difference if you play games or not, the movie doesn't compel you to be a gamer to appreciate its nuances. This is literally for everyone. It embodies a beautiful message about Freedom, Love, and most importantly, how an artificial world could educate us on the way of living. Perhaps at times better than the world we currently live in.",Free Guy
77,SameirAli,Pick up a movie from every scene.,7,6 October 2021,"The best way to enjoy this movie is to watch it without any review or trailer or anything. I don't know why, but, most of Ryan Reynolds films give me a taste of Deadpool. I often think that he should come out of it. Free Guy is like a cocktail of plenty of films like Deadpool, Groundhog Day, The Truman Show, Ready Player One, They Live and so much more. There are more direct references to other films as well, like the Cameo of Chris Evans, Hulk fist, bunny in Donnie Darko etc.The first half of the movie was really enjoyable. But, soon it fell into obvious cliché tracks. But, in total the film is enjoyable.",Free Guy
78,MrDHWong,A ridiculously fun romp that utilises its clever concept to full potential,8,30 September 2021,"""Free Guy"" is a sci-fi comedy film directed by Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum trilogy, Real Steel). Starring Ryan Reynolds in the lead role, it is a ridiculously fun romp that utilises its clever concept to full potential.In the open-world online video game ""Free City"", a non-player character (NPC) known simply as ""Guy"" (Ryan Reynolds) works as a bank teller, blissfully ignorant of all the chaos happening around him. One otherwise normal day, Guy passes by a player going by the screen name of ""MolotovGirl"" (Jodie Comer), who hums a song he has always hoped the girl of his dreams will like. This causes Guy to suddenly deviate from his regular programming and steal a pair of sunglasses from a player attempting to rob his bank. Upon wearing the sunglasses, Guy is now able to see what other players see through their heads-up display (HUD) and decides to seek out MolotovGirl in hopes of learning what all of this truly means.I'm certain every gamer has at least one NPC they remember fondly. Whether it's the eccentric hobos in Grand Theft Auto IV rambling about reptilians and the illuminati or Youngster Joey in Pokémon proclaiming his love for shorts because ""they're comfy and easy to wear"", these amusing little oddities programmed into our favourite games have continued to capture people's hearts for many years. But have you ever wondered if these NPCs would one day became sentient and did their own thing? ...No? Well, regardless of that, ""Free Guy"" happens to address this strange idea for a movie in the best way possible.The film takes a refreshing meta approach to video game focused stories by deconstructing many of the clichés we've come to expect. We see armed helicopters crashing spectacularly in the streets, fast cars plowing down innocent pedestrians, and the generic repeated dialogue uttered by bystanders who act as though they are seeing this for the first time. It's so funny to watch how throughout it all, Guy just goes about his daily business as if this is somehow a normal existence, not once questioning the circumstances, until now of course.One film that came to mind here was ""The Truman Show"", where the protagonist Truman Burbank slowly starts to realise that the life he leads is merely fabricated entertainment for curious observers. Unlike Truman, however, Guy immediately seizes the moment to break away from his artificially programmed monotony and becomes world famous as a result. Whether or not this is intended as a satirical commentary on real life itself is up for debate but I still find it an amusing tidbit inserted in there by the writers.In addition to its funny take on video game tropes, the film is also quite the visual treat. The world of ""Free City"" looks like the perfect amalgamation of virtually every online game you could come across, from Grand Theft Auto to Fortnite. It was great fun to point out all of the Easter eggs and inside references to the games I have previously played because unlike a certain sequel to a Looney Tunes basketball movie, most of the gags here actually worked. I also loved how despite his intentionally bland attire, Guy ironically stands out prominently among the rest of the film's bright backgrounds in a lot of scenes. Even as a reflection of modern day gaming, some famous Twitch streamers make cameo appearances that actually prove beneficial to the plot (although personally I only recognised about two of them, the rest could walk past me on the street and I would never know who they were). This film was clearly written by people who understand the current trends in video games and aren't just a bunch of old corporate higher-ups that have no idea how the younger generation operates.Ryan Reynolds once again proves he is one of the funniest and most likeable actors working today as he does a great job playing an everyman like Guy. His odd mannerisms, stiff body language, and unremarkable physical appearance near the start of the film are so loveably lame that watching him transform into such a legendary tough character was hilarious. I consider Reynolds to be one of those actors who succeeds in portraying characters intended to be the obvious centre of attention but aren't afraid to give the spotlight away to others who may deserve it more.With that said, I liked the rest of the cast as well, with Jodie Comer holding her own as ""MolotovGirl"", whose real name is Millie. Her character proves to be a great straight woman to Guy's humorous antics and I often laughed at her reactions to the situations he landed them both in. Joe Keery also has his fair share of nice moments as well as game developer Walter ""Keys"" McKey. It's nice to see that Keery is getting more important roles outside of ""Stranger Things"" and here he demonstrates that he has what it takes to be a memorable supporting actor.Although I wouldn't say he stole the movie, Taika Waititi certainly left an impression as the film's villain Antwan, a greedy, megalomaniacal CEO of the company that distributes ""Free City"". The film touches briefly on Antwan's contentious relationship with gamers, similar to how real game company CEOs sometimes clash with players on social media platforms. I wish the film had explored that a bit further because I believe it would have made for an interesting side plot.In the end, ""Free Guy"" is one of those rare examples of a film that works both as an entertaining comedy and as a commentary on a topical subject, in this instance, video games. I'd say the length of its overall appeal stretches from the current Generation Z all the way back to the old school gamers of Generation X, with the Millennials somewhere in the middle. Not to say that there aren't any out there but I doubt viewers in the Baby Boomer age bracket will find much to appreciate here, so they need not bother. As for everyone else, I foresee this becoming a cult classic years from now so check it out before its popularity explodes.I rate it 8/10.",Free Guy
79,eva3si0n,Free Guy is very reminiscent of Ready Player One,6,2 November 2021,"Free Guy is very reminiscent of Ready Player One. Here, the whole film is also kept on references to the culture of video games and using also all possible sterotypes. Ryan Reynolds did well in his role. Unfortunately, the film is designed for a very young audience, we can say children's.",Free Guy
80,TheTruthofItIs,Better titled as Love Will Find a Way,7,23 October 2021,"Yes, this film has the look and feel of a CG-based video game story but it's really a love story with Ryan Reynold's ""Guy"" character as our lovestruck protag. Look, compared to all the other Covid-era dreck that's been shoved at us, this is a breath of fresh air, it's actually pretty good with a decent technical premise, but it IS a love story, so make it more of a date-night thing. Finally, I tire of the ""isn't he so cute/hot"" that's written into the script referencing his character, it's a bit self-indulgent and ego-feeding than necessary to the story.",Free Guy

82,cardsrock,The Lego Movie meets Ready Player One meets Elf,7,15 August 2021,"Free Guy really does feel like a mish mash of several other projects, but that isn't necessarily a negative. It combines some solid elements from other films to make a fun, energetic summer blockbuster.Ryan Reynolds has basically created his own subgenre at this point and I for one am all for it. His vivacious charisma makes this film a breeze to watch. Jodie Comer is terrific as usual and Taika Waititi has fun hamming it up as the villain. The script isn't groundbreaking, but there are a few dashes of genuine thoughtfulness. The cameos are amusing and Free Guy's new overlord Disney allowed for some fun moments which I won't spoil. The real life love story seemed unnecessary, but I honestly did buy into the in-game one.Free Guy is a stimulating diversion that knows exactly what it is and delivers on what it promises.",Free Guy
83,CANpatbuck3664,Solid Effort but With the Hype I Expected a Little More,7,23 September 2021,"Free Guy's trailer grabbed me from the first minute with its core premise of an npc gaining awareness and taking over a GTA style game. Its a funny idea and they brought in the right people with Shawn Levy directing and Ryan Reynolds starring. When the movie leans into the zaniness, Free Guy is at its funniest. There's so many different directions they could go with this idea and they do their best to keep you on your toes. But I wouldn't say this movie is an envelope pusher or a pioneer for its execution. Other than some moments here and there, Free Guy feels reserved and pulled back. They even pour on the drama pretty heavy at different points in the story to give it some emotional weight and that's where it fell short. I don't always mind a movie deciding to be family-friendly if they know how to spin it to keep both the adults and the kids interested. But I think Reynolds and the creative team could have gave into their darker impulses a bit more instead of being so clean and it would have helped the movie.I always joke with my friends that everyone liked Ryan Reynolds so much, he got 2 or 3 extra chances as a leading man and he almost wasted those too. Thank goodness Deadpool came along and its to his credit that he was able to keep the momentum going into Free Guy. Ryan's his typical charming and funny self here, he's one of the best at flipping from smiling with joyful innocence to relishing in some juvenile and crass gag. He's in great form here, he's got all the range needed to pull of Guy as a character and I have to credit him and his chemistry with Jodie Comer for helping keep the movie going when the pacing started to slack. Comer works well on her own here too, I hadn't seen her in anything before this. I think she worked better with Reynolds than Keery but she's good as both characters. Lil Rey Howery put in a very sincere performance as Guy's friend Buddy, his character's completely rounded over edges were a little cloying for me but that's not the fault of his performance. I liked Joe Keery as Keys, his character has his moments where Keery steps out of the nerd stereotype. I wish they had given him a little more to do, he really stands out in the Stranger Things ensemble but he's fine in his supporting role here. Taika Waititi was a fun addition as Antwan, he made me laugh a few times and he's going for it in Free Guy. His take on the character reminded me a lot of a younger Jim Carrey where he's walking the fine line between exaggerated and just gobbling up the scenery.The overall plot arc of Free Guy is deceptive, the idea of an npc (non-playable character) coming to life is a new slant but if you put narrative under a microscope, it's surprising how by the numbers it is. The movie's message of taking control of your life and not being satisfied with being a background player is not new but it worked a little better than the other moral of the story. Where it doesn't translate is what its trying to say about video game development and treating npcs better. I consider myself part of the gaming community but broken on release games and the content creators being more concerned about $ instead of a quality product is a painfully obvious in today's marketplace. But I was annoyed that Free Guy presents it like they're asking you a profound question or airing some of the industries' dirty laundry. Also, the twist of hardcore gamers deciding to straighten up and be decent human beings in a GTA like atmosphere, don't make me laugh. The script's heart is in the right place but I couldn't get behind it, its too naive to be plausible.Getting to what wasn't as impressive about Free Guy, I found the movie to be very funny in sporadic moments or in a few scenes but most of the movie was only chuckle worthy. I'm a big Reynolds fan and he's given an almost limitless playground to bounce off of other characters but Free Guy's narrative is so sentimental that the story progression halted the comedic momentum frequently. The end features the same romantic entanglement that has wrapped up so many other movies before it (the girl/guy of my dreams was in front of me the whole time trope). I saw it coming from a mile away (I'd argue that if you've seen a handful of movies in your lifetime, you will too) and instead of punctuating the rest of the narrative or providing a new twist, it felt it was pretty cliche. It was also cool to get some game streamer personalities into the movie but they pop up too often. Free Guy keeps cutting back to them again and again and even though I like a couple of the people they included, I kept hoping the movie would grow past that gimmick and leave it behind.Free Guy has a concept that grabs your attention and the top shelf window dressing (great cast, cameos, licensed products) to keep you entertained throughout. But it didn't hold up to more thorough scrutiny and that's what brings a movie down from great to good. But despite the fact that I didn't fall in love with it like a friend of mine did when he saw it, I am happy Free Guy found its audience and that it has been successful. Reynolds' career revival continues to pickup steam and I'll always look forward to seeing what he'll do next. If they decided to make a sequel, I'd also be interested in seeing where these characters go next so I'd recommend Free Guy on your preferred streaming service. But try and tune out the hype before you hit play, it would have helped me enjoy it a little more.",Free Guy
84,rdoubleoc,Pretty solid.,10,6 October 2021,"Don't expect the same experience as Ready Player One, but it's a fun movie that's a lot like it. I think this one sentence sums the movie up pretty good.Maybe Hollywood isn't totally lost like I thought.I think they could've came up with a cooler story for the whole ""original code"" sub plot, but that's my only real complaint. And everyone knows code doesn't ""evolve"" by itself, but whatever. I took one star off for these. The writing could've been more realistic, despite it being based on video games. However, I readded the star to compensate for believed fake reviews trashing the movie. So, 10/10.",Free Guy

86,statuskuo,Blue Shirt Guy Rules!,8,15 August 2021,"Charming and rambunctious I found it hard not to like Ryan Reynolds's often tiresome off-the-cuff banter and self-awareness. Here he plays a clueless NPC in a video game that had the outside world attacking the interior world in mindless mayhem. To me, that works THE best.Apparently ""Free City"" is the most popular game in the world. So popular that even in China they have gameplay being streamed. If anyone questions this, there is a Vietnamese restaurant in L. A. that does this. And watching people play has been its own industry. That said, it is, as most said, derivative of other movies most notably ""They Live"" ""Ready Player One"" ""The Truman Show"" and ""Groundhogs Day"" to mention a few. But it's not a bad nod. In fact, that is point of these types of open world video games...to catch the Easter eggs when they present themselves. For me, it was enough of good will to make it a very fun diversion. Kudos to Jodie Comer whose innocent sweet Millie (even the name is adorable) adds that crushable trait you nerds love. Myself included. An 80's trope to say the least. Overall, it is a movie that understands the gamers that will get it the most. For others, there is an interesting love story...to say the least that may not feel entirely satisfactory as if you've grown to want Blue Shirt Guy to succeed he must have more than a hardy handshake and a piece of land to call his own.",Free Guy

92,sweidman-28016,Something For Everyone,7,24 August 2021,"""I know this world is just a game, but this place, these people, that's all I have. So I'm not gonna be the good guy. I'm gonna be a great guy.""In Free Guy, a bank teller who discovers he is actually a background player in an open-world video game, decides to become the hero of his own story. Now in a world where there are no limits, he is determined to be the guy who saves his world his way before it is too late. When I look back at all the blockbusters we've had this summer, Free Guy stands out among them. Of course, there was Black Widow and A Quiet Place: Part II (though that feels more like spring to me), Free Guy is a standalone movie that all can enjoy without having to see one or installments beforehand. Also, it's doing wonderfully at the box office. I'm not big on video games, and I did worry a little that this would be too heavily involved with gamer knowledge and all of that. Luckily, this is trying to reach out to all audiences. Obviously this is 100% a crowd pleaser. The movie is filled with action, humor, and heart. Ryan Reynolds is at the center of it playing Guy. He nails the comedy like we've seen him do in the past. The comedy might be the best part of it. There's enough for both kids and adults to enjoy. A sort of surprise (but not too much of a surprise) comedic performance comes from Jodie Comer. We've seen her do everything in Killing Eve and now it seems she'll be a making it big in the movies, especially with The Last Duel later this year. She was my favorite acting performance of the stacked cast. Everyone has a fun part to them so it's easy to like at least most of them.They advertised the hell out of this movie. With each new trailer it felt like we'd already seen the movie. Honestly, it was exhausting after a while. So while the story was unveiling itself, it did setup a little different than I expected, but still it was hard to avoid spotting certain clips from the trailers. Once it gets to the spot that we already knew, things pick up. I can't say our villain was all that compelling, but I guess for the circumstances it at least makes sense. Taika Waititi sure had fun, but I didn't care as much as the characters. Going through the Truman Show existential crisis was interesting and we got a few scenes with pretty good writing out of it. Shawn Levy was going for something very ambitious, which it is, and he mostly nailed the direction. The movie might be a little longer than it needs to and therefore everything doesn't always flow together as well as it should. But with as much fun as it is, it's hard to find yourself not liking it. Though it is early to tell, Free Guy feels like a movie that will be enjoyable into the future by many. Like I said, there's something for everyone. With a good story, funny performances, and a great use of 'Fantasy' by Mariah Carey, it's a blast from start to finish.",Free Guy
93,dfle3,A mash-up of fairy tale and video game action fare. 72.5+%,7,14 September 2021,"The plot of this film concerns an extremely realistic looking world in an online, open-world action video game called ""Free City"" which is very popular amongst gamers in the real world. An ordinary looking person in that game, called ""Guy"" (played by Ryan Reynolds), starts having a very disruptive effect on people who play the game in the real world...as well as characters in the game itself. As we later get a glimpse into the real world, we learn that there is some drama between the makers of the game and other game developers. This tension supplies the action quotient of the film, which plays out in both the real world and the world of the game.""Free guy"" (""Free Guy""?) has elements of fairytale, action, comedy and romance. Some way into this film, I was thinking that it might have worked better as entertainment if it was aimed at a much younger audience, as in being an actual Disney family film, where the whole family could watch it and enjoy it. On many fronts it functions on that level, from the comedy, to the action and to the romance, with the latter being very chaste. However, there is one scene very early on where a character gets a very badly broken nose, which is not pleasant to look at, so moments like that definitely rule out a younger audience, even though it is otherwise a Disney kind of family film in most other respects. That being said, the humour is at times queer in this film, uncomfortably so at times, though not without raising a smile, like the scene where Ryan's best friend ""Buddy""(! Played by Lil Rel Howery) gets friendly with a familiar looking big, strapping bloke.""Guy"", as played by Ryan Reynolds is pretty much a variation on the character he's played in all the other films that I've seen him in recently, like ""Hobbs & Shaw"" and the ""Deadpool"" films. In this film, Reynolds turns his usual schtick up to ""4"". It makes me wonder if Reynolds contributes dialogue to the characters that he plays or whether he has a usual collaborator who comes up with this kind of weird stuff. His dialogue can be inappropriate yet amusing, for instance when he makes religious references.For what it's worth, I managed to work out the mystery surrounding Guy before the characters which brought my attention to this mystery.""Free guy/Guy"" did bring to mind other films that I have seen, like ""The matrix"" (I see no reason why you couldn't also get philosophical and deep with this film) and a couple of other films for specific elements, like ""Dark City"" (with regard to a location in the film) and ""They live"" (which I haven't seen but the thing with sunglasses here reminded me of what I read about the older film). Looking at a review online, I was reminded of ""The Truman show"" which would also be a point of comparison for this release.Watching this film, it was tracking to score 70% from me but leading up to the halfway point it wasn't really doing it for me, so I was looking to score it maybe 67.5+%. However, from the second half onward I found myself laughing more and getting more out of the film. That's just to say that I found it reasonably entertaining without regarding it as the best example of a Hollywood 'popcorn' film. I enjoyed Reynolds' performance more in ""Hobbs & Shaw"" (going on memory) and I liked ""Boss level"" more, which also has a video game element to it (I've reviewed both films here). However, ""Free Guy"" does work on a slightly-inappropriate-for-a-Disney-film level.",Free Guy

Back this up with a supporting cast of Jodie Comer, Joe Keery and Taika Waititi and you have yourself a winner. All of them were brilliant and brought so much to the film. The interactions between Ryan and Jodie were priceless and I could watch the film again almost immediately just for those scenes.I think the biggest surprise came from the plot though. If you're expecting something a bit simple and phoned in think again. It mixed so many different genres and themes, like a cross between Westworld, The Matrix and an over the top superhero movie. The result was to make Free Guy a really really entertaining film.It also boasts incredible visuals.

105,daisukereds,A decent one-time watch,6,26 September 2021,"Not much of a ""Video Game"" movie.It's more of a hastily-written Romance with a ""tech guys vs Corporate Giant"" plot tying it together, as well as an added Virtual World backdrop for generic-flavorless action scenes. It's still kind of fun!The concept and execution are interestingly weird. Certainly light.. It's not demanding or has deep concepts of any kind. Feels fresh and ""hip"" (mostly not in a good way). It mostly works for me because of the huge charm of Ryan and Jodie. The humor on the other hand.. was always terrible, and never landed for me. If it made sense, I would say this is pure frosting and no ""meat"". Has at least one good references, and a LOT of uneeded ""popular"" streamers showing for no reason.Would recommend solely for the amusement to anyone interested.",Free Guy

The previously-shown sociopathic women and girls were conveniently forgotten in order to insult only the men and boys. :)Also there's a female NPC prostitute who says: ""I don't have to be with any guy, most of them are awful, exactly right!""Also some girl of course coded some amazing AI and is the ""brains"" behind everything, and the most upstanding person in the movie, while her boyfriend acts and is treated like a doormat ""in her shadow"".Also ""white privilege"", ""patriarchy"" and ""male virginity"" were some of the generic out-of-touch corporate pandering buzzwords randomly thrown in for good (pandering) measure.Because you know, again, this movie knows how to pander at all costs, and insulting men and shoving in corporate faux feminism is top-tier Hollywood pandering.And there's a bunch of real-world kid-popular YouTubers and e-thots in this movie, despite the fact that it's a movie with heavy swearing and clearly not for kids, because Disney / 20th Century Studios know children will see it anyways (and the studios want that, the movie was designed to attract children). Yes, Disney is at the core of this movie, so you shouldn't be at all surprised at how plagiarized and toxic it really is.But yeah keep eating it up, over and over again. Keep being oblivious like the NPCs in this movie. Consume, be stupid, gullible, susceptible to pandering like Disney and Hollywood wants you to be. Don't ever stand up and clap back.

108,fciocca,"Funny and enjoyable popcorn movie, with the typical Ryan Reynolds comedy.",6,29 August 2021,"""Free Guy"" is a light-hearted and funny movie that entertained me for a couple of hours, and made me forget the fuss of real life. Ryan Reynolds is as always great in his comedy skits, but it was not his best performance. Still the Guy character is very likeable and has a nice development. Jodie Comer cannot really stand out, she is flat and boring. Just another cliche seen many times. I do not feel that she really accomplished anything on her own, she is constantly helped by someone else, which is pretty annoying. In my opinion, they could have used her a little bit better, considering that she is part of the main cast. Taika Waititi plays the main villain, who represents the evil side of big video game companies that only care about money and they do not consider what players really want. Considering what the market is nowadays, I would say that what is depicted in the movie is not too far from reality.The story is very straightforward and not particularly original, but the formula works. Hollywood made several attempts to adapt video games stories to the big screen, and very few succeeded. In this case director Shawn Levy nailed it and delivered a good movie with tons of pop culture references that will make everyone smile. Special effects are good and Free City is exactly how I would depict GTA in a film: chaotic, nonsensical and inhabited by crazy people. They even decided to pick some real famous youtubers and streamers from the gaming community to immerse the audience even more in this world.",Free Guy
109,DeBBss,A simplistic movie that aims to entertain,7,27 October 2021,"Free Guy is a simple movie that aims to entertain, and to entertain it did. Free Guy knows what type of film it is; it tells a fun and heart-warming story with likable characters. Guy is extremely likable, which isn't surprising considering Ryan Reynolds is playing him. The CGI is good and the action is over the top, just like a video game. And there's some great cameos and fan service.Free Guy does have its flaws. You can tell that the screenwriters aren't gamers, so there's going to be some scenes and plot devices that don't make much sense. And the film does have its fair share of cringe moments.Overall, I found Free Guy to be fun, entertaining, and likable. This is a movie that will most likely put a smile on your face, so I'd give it a strong recommendation to anyone who's interested in watching it.",Free Guy

director: Shawn Levy
starring: Ryan Reynolds, Jodie Comer, Joe Keery, Taika Watiti, Lil rel Howery, Utkarsh Ambudkar, Aaron W Reed etcA Bank teller discovers that he's an NPC inside a brutal, open world video game. I had an absolute blast with Free Guy, and it was one of most fun times I have had at the cinema this year.My first few positives would be the fun idea and fantastic cinematography. As well as the excellent action and humour. And the fantastic chemistry between the cast. This film was just a fun idea, it was refreshing to have an original big movie and this film didn't disappoint with the insane creativity and thought that went into the plot. The cinematography was also excellent, this film was visually beautiful. It made you feel like you were a player in the game. And the massive scope that the movie managed to create within the story world was very impressive. The action was also surprisingly strong. It was entertaining and thrilling. And incorporated a lot of the story world and set pieces really well. Next, the film was hilarious. For me, every single joke landed. The humour was creative, clever and extremely well thought out. It never felt forced, and it went all out, which is always a risk but one in this case that paid off. The cast also had fantastic chemistry. Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer were brilliant together. They had natural chemistry, excellent comedic timing with each other and they just worked excellently. The whole cast had this brilliant charm and chemistry with one another as well that made it so much fun to watch.My next few positives would be the interesting elements and fantastic cameos. The set up was fun and the worldbuilding was excellent. As well as the great soundtrack and character background/motivation. I found the whole story world and process within the game interesting. It was fascinating to see Guy and the other characters repeat the same day to day chores and as soon as they die it all repeats itself. It was comedic and clever and was always slightly different so the audience would stay interested. I also thought the cameos in the film were extremely fun. They were surprising, hilarious and really cleverly used. The Cross promotion from different brands was a very clever idea and it made the film a great crowd pleaser. The set up was also a lot of fun. Guy's realisation of his situation thanks to Jodie Comer's character was well done. Him wearing glasses to see how the game works and how to level up. Set Guy up on a fun journey to reach a certain level and developed the plot well. I also thought the worldbuilding was strong. The film built such a strong and in-depth world and it really surprised me. There is so much more they could do with this brand which is amazing. But everything was so intricate and well thought out it was amazing to see. I also loved the films soundtrack. It bought so many great comedic moments, and fitted with the tone of the film excellently. With a mixture of cheesy early 2000's pop music from Mariah Carey and Britney Spears. It sounds bad but for this film it tonally worked brilliantly. I also really liked the character background and motivation for Jodie Comer and Joe Keery's characters Millie and Keys. The film went into good detail at the bond between the characters and how they created the game. Expanding the story world. Linking to the villain well and giving both characters good motivations for their actions as the film developed.I only had two minor issues with the film. Some of the twists were slightly predictable. And The villain was slightly too over the top and underused. Some of the twists were fairly formulaic and you could tell what was going to happen, this dampened some of the creativity but didn't impact my enjoyment of the film. I also thought the villain was slightly too over the top. I couldn't really take him seriously; it might have been the point but it would have been nice to have him be more of a threat.My next few positives would be the fantastic set pieces and likeable characters. As well as the development to the plot and the contrasts between the game and the real world. This film had some truly beautiful and creative set pieces. They were not only visually stunning, but also incorporated into a lot of the action scenes. Once again expanding the story world and making the film feel like an open world video game. I also thought the characters were extremely likeable. Guy was just such a loveable main character. This was helped by the most part due to Ryan Reynolds. But Guy was such a carefree and charming character that was easy to connect with. This high level of like ability includes the whole cast of characters as well. I also thought the plot developed really well and it was structured brilliantly. I really liked the different and fun layers to the film as Guy had to level up in order to become stronger and a better and more useful character, and to help Millie. Setting up the second half of the second act as well and the final act really well. Finally, I also really liked the contrasts between the game and the real world. I liked that the film spent a good time developing and balancing out the relationships in the real world as well as in the game. It showed a healthy balance between the differences with the characters and gave the film the opportunity to flesh out all the characters well.My Final few positives would be the great rising of stakes. Good themes, great final act and satisfying ending. The film raised the stakes excellently, with the threat of the whole game being destroyed it really increased the tension for the characters, and the implications of this was well explored so therefore it gave the villain some needed menace. I also thought the film touched upon some good themes. I think not getting addicted to games and living in the real world was touched upon well, as well as standing out and being yourself. It promoted a lot of positive things that I think worked very well. I also thought the final act was so much fun. The humour, action and pop culture references were turned up to a 100 which I absolutely loved. There was never a dull moment, and I was incredibly entertained and laughing from start to finish. The ending was also very satisfying, it was nice to see all the game characters safe after the events of the final act, and the romantic chemistry between Jodie Comer and Joe Keery was on full display in a very heartfelt and sweet final moment of the film.Overall, Free Guy is a clever and fun concept. Executed incredibly well. With a charming, hilarious and creative film that built such a fantastic new franchise. Don't have a good day have a great day is something I am going to be quoting for a long time. You really need to see this especially if you are into gaming.Overall rating 95/100.",Free Guy
111,jwscott-home,I expected a bit more from a Reynolds mivie,7,18 October 2021,He had several really good movies in a row and now it feels like a string of just average ones. Hed'd do better to do less movies and focus on doing just great ones.. just my opinion.,Free Guy
112,Donatien3,A Fun Ride,9,2 October 2021,"If you can get past the at-time technical computer game jargon, then ""Free Guy"" is a lot of fun.The premise is fairly simple: Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a seemingly happy NPC (non playable character) in the game 'Free City' (a 'Grand Theft Auto""-style open world game) who discovers there's more to life after an encounter with Molotov Girl/Millie Rusk (Jodie Comer). He soon embraces his new life as the powerful AI Blue Shirt Guy, levelling up at a rapid rate. Reynolds also plays Guy's jacked-up counterpart Dude, who has some of the best lines towards the end of the movie.Meanwhile, in the real world there's a love story between game designers Walter ""Keys"" McKeys (Joe Keery) and Rusk, who created the idyllic indie game ""Free Life"" together (which has a similarly relaxed pace to the ""Animal Crossing"" franchise). Meanwhile, the greedy boss of Soonami Games (Taika Waititi, who fortunately keeps his natural New Zealand accent) is more focused on pre-sales for the upcoming ""Free City 2"" and making as much money as possible.As mentioned at the start of this review, the technical aspects means that actual gamers will get a lot more from ""Free Guy"" than the average viewer. There's also a few cameos from assumedly famous video games streamers. Though Reynolds' charisma and a lot of action - Guy's 'levelling-up' montage is a highlight - means there's plenty here for non-gamers to enjoy.",Free Guy
113,ginocox-206-336968,All the dramatic impact of a potato chip hurled in anger by a petulant toddler,3,27 September 2021,"Free Guy (2021) begins as a fluffy bit of cinematic nonsense for video-game-addicted adolescents, but around the midpoint decides to get serious and deliver a profound statement, so goes woke and wears its wokeness like an albatross around its neck, weighing it down and distracting from the whimsical nonsense in a painfully obvious manner.To be certain, there are elements of wokeness from the very beginning. The cast is nearly as diverse as the United Nations General Assembly, to an extent that seems unrealistic, causing cracks in the viewer's willful suspension of disbelief, already stressed by balancing two worlds, one fantastic and the other realistic.The most obvious concession to wokeness seems to be in casting the female lead, who seems to have been chosen more for what she isn't than for what she is. One can almost imagine the woke casting debate: ""She can't be too sexy or too attractive, as we don't want to objectify women. She has a lot of action scenes, but can't be too fit, as she might alienate our female viewers, as two out of three American females are overweight or obese. She's playing opposite Ryan Reynolds, who is forty-four, so has to be age-appropriate."" The result is a pleasantly plump auntie, who looks as if she should be selling apple pies in a small-town bakery, rather than battling heavily-armed mercenaries; who dresses frumpy in her character's real life, but chooses a video-game avatar that wears tight leather pants emphasizing an ample booty and a metal breastplate under her shirt to hide any jiggling when she runs. The character is supposed to be an extraordinarily talented programmer, but seems a little slow on the uptake, constantly relying on her male sidekick to bring her up to speed. She doesn't have anything interesting to say, and her only outside interests are ice cream and playground swings. Yet, we're supposed to believe that two handsome guys fall hopelessly in love with her from a distance.The early scenes offer a cornucopia of state-of-the-art special effects to distract from the nonsensical plot. Impressively, the background is often filled with diverse CGI effects occurring simultaneously. But it quickly grows repetitive, as the filmmakers dig themselves inextricably into a plot hole. They could have explored various themes, such as the meaning of life, or separating fantasies from reality. Instead they throw in a mishmash of half-baked woke talking points. Corporations are evil. Adolescents are really 1960s flower children corrupted by violent video games. Ordinary people have untapped potential, but are dehumanized by corporate employers. Handguns should be outlawed. Sexual orientation is fluid. Men are empowered by the women in their lives.Perhaps the most promising message is that we should put video games aside and live our lives, but it comes across with all the impact of a potato chip hurled in anger by a petulant toddler.Despite all the wokeness and ever more spectacular CGI effects, the movie remains mired in a plot hole. To extricate, one character simply abandons the MacGuffin that has driven much of the plot in exchange for something that is later also abandoned. Another character abandons a driving motivation. Everybody in the world abruptly and fundamentally changes preferences for no coherent reason. The villain is smacked down with a deus ex machina plot resolution. The fantasy world seems to devolve from a socialist utopia to a dystopian nightmare with a lot of pretty trees. Along the way, the film patches gaps in the plot by creating unexpected causes and effects in both the real and the fantasy worlds.Overall, it is a fun movie until it starts to take itself seriously; perhaps best suited to viewing at home while multitasking. Kudos for production values and impressive digital effects. The script fails to take full advantage of a promising premise and the actors seem hamstrung by a script that seems a few re-writes short of completion. Like many recent movies, it kowtows to wokeness at the expense of entertainment value and dramatic impact. Much of the dialogue is probably relevant to adolescent videogame addicts, but meaningless to those who haven't played since Pac-Man was the rage. Like a theme park ride, it's fun for the duration, but doesn't impart any profound insights about life, love, or video gaming.",Free Guy
114,MogwaiMovieReviews,Do NPCs Dream Of Electric Sheep?,6,28 September 2021,"Yes, this story of a videogame character becoming self-aware is a hodgepodge of many other ideas done many times before, most obviously in The Truman Show and The Matrix, but there's still quite a bit to enjoy, especially early on: Ryan Reynolds is hugely likeable, and his isolated performance could almost be a decent unofficial Deadpool 3.The rest of the cast and story are varying degrees below that level, and, as the film goes on, the plotholes get larger and larger and it makes less and less sense. A lot of work has successfully been put into comic detail, but the worldbuilding and internal consistency is barely there at all. The love subplot in particular just crumbles as soon as you breathe on it.Some folks have complained about a few woke talking points being shoehorned into the film, but it's really not the worst offender in this regard by any means, and on the whole it's just an old-fashioned summer blockbuster that's often a decent amount of fun, at least in parts, and just as long as you don't try think about any of it at all.",Free Guy

So he breaks the 4th wall from fake acting when ever he speaks. His supporting characters come across patronising for no reason.The other two main good characters are young and haven't developed their own personality - they mostly smile and say all the right things. Sometimes posing in hero shots, sometimes smoothly arguing with volume for no reason. - Totally the opposite of calm collected rebels letting off steam, which is what the Players in the game are about.If you watch it for Reynolds, his character's best friend, and the CGI, it's worth it.",Free Guy
117,ayoreinf,"Three age-old issues that troubled art cinema and phylosophy for eons, in a lighthearted comedy",9,22 August 2021,"From Buster Keaton in Sherlock Jr. To Woody Allen in the Purple Rose of Cairo cinema directors fiddled with the idea of characters blurring the lines between cinema and real world, and lets not forget the underrated masterpiece of John McTiernan - Last Action Hero. In recent decades the idea of getting into the movie has shifted slightly with the invention of virtual reality and video games and we got us Tron, Ready Player One and Wreck-it Ralph. As I mentioned when discussing Ready Player One movies and video games are interchangeable when this issue is discussed. The real issue in both cases is the question of creating a world with a certain set of rules and then moving between that world and ours as means of examining the rules controlling our world. Same is true of Disney's Enchanted. In fact it's a double question not only examining the rules controlling our world but stating that the movie has created a world real enough for real people to live in. Woody Allen in Purple Rose definitely prefers the character Jeff Daniels has in the movie - Tom Baxter to the actor who plays him - Gil Shepherd (both of them of course played by Jeff Daniels).So, we actually have here the issue of the artist as a creator. This goes back as far as discussing art go. In the Italian Renaissance it was suggested that god is in fact the original artist and we're his masterpiece. No wonder then that Woody Allen discusses the issue of god so often in his comedies confusing God repeatedly with directors or scriptwriters. Here comes the 3rd issue I promised - the idea of Pygmalion going back all the way to Greek mythology the artist/creator who falls in love with his creation. I won't elaborate too much on this issue as this entry could take forever, but I have to mention that Woody Allen also obsessed about this issue in most of his great movies.The weird point is that these issues which seem to belong to the realm of philosophy are popping up repeatedly in comedies. In a way, trying not to force the issue on the viewers allowing them to ignore it altogether. Here comes one of my favorite questions of cinema viewing - ""how deep can it be when the entire thing is so lighthearted?"" all I can say is give you my personal answer - as deep as you're willing to take it.For me, the whole thing is interconnected. The idea of the movie as a complete world with its characters growing into complete human beings - it does call for some serious acting performance but in my humble opinion the cast lives up to the challenge. Kudos to Ryan Reynolds and to Jodie Comer but the entire cast shines when called upon.The idea of love as a creative impulse pushed all the way here - love is the creative force and the creators love their creation - see the movie and tell me I'm wrong. In fact all the three issues I mentioned in my title are playing together all through the movie making it such a delight.Yes it's fun and funny, but for me it's so much better because it's also so much more.",Free Guy

119,movieman6-413-929510,Entertaining movie for gamers.,6,14 August 2021,"Free Guy is a new action comedy directed by Shawn Levy, the director of Real Steel and The Night at the Museum trilogy.The film is set in the open-world video game Free City where non-player character Guy (Ryan Reynolds) acts like a computer program every day. When he meets the gamer Molotov Girl (Jodie Comer), he falls in love with her and to follow her goes against his computer program. He discovers that he is a computer program and so decides to play the game in his own way, to have a chance at Molotov Girl. He must do all this before the head of the video game company Antoine (Taika Waititi) tries to reset the game.This movie is entertaining for gamers as the movie has many references and elements from video games. The film even features cameos from well-known internet gamers. For people who are not that familiar with video games, certain moments or objects can come across as unfamiliar illogical moments.The use of a green screen and CGI can be seen in the film, but because the film has to come across as a video game, they get away with it. Viewers expect to see a movie where it feels like you are watching a video game. There is no need to see the movie in 3D, as there are few good 3D effects or moments in the movie. Shawn Levy had to portray the real and video game world in a different way and also to visualize how the real world characters see the images from the video game world.Most of the movie cast also doubles as their real world character as well as their game world character. For example, some of the cast have to portray their one role in a different way than how they play their second role. Since Ryan Reynolds starts his character as a video game background character, this film tries to give actors who play more often background characters or more in TV series a chance to get a bigger role in this film. Ryan Reynolds himself was first known as an actor as a TV actor from, for example, the TV series Two Guys and a Girl, before he broke through as a film actor.",Free Guy

121,srdjan_veljkovic,A misfire in general with a few minor hits,5,13 August 2021,"In movies like these, if you're truly original, a lot can be forgiven. Take TRON for example. But, by now, movies with transitions between video games and real world aren't new. Sure, using a ""free world"" like GTA as the setting is not so much explored, but, still, not truly original.So, we have Ryan Reynolds goofing around. He does a decent job, but, his routine is getting a little old. Not every character should be played like Merc With a Mouth.Jodie Comer as the female game developer and the ""second protagonist"" is a little interesting, if for nothing else, then for the fact that she does look much better with black hair and sunglasses than blonde and without them. But she's also the only one who does a good, if not great, job here.There are a few jokes that work, but, it's not nearly enough for 2 hours, especially given how many times they try. There are several fun parts, but, there's much more time spent trying to look as having fun which don't work.The cameos and pop culture references are pretty good and it's good that there are but a few of them.But, the story is thin and full of holes, the relationship between Comer and her male game developer partner is terribly done, the ending is rather lame, the gaming setup is a little too much if you're not a gamer, given that that it didn't work as much as intended to make jokes and fun. Taika Waititi as the main villain has a bad case of over-acting and his character acts rather stupid for a guy who's smart (if evil).The forced feminism and other ""social justice warrior"" elements are truly bad, out of place and look as if someone ""from corporate"" was making sure there's the prescribed amount of them so they can ship the movie.All in all, a strange mixed bag.

The slight issue I had with the movie is that I felt like the video game did not feel and look like a video game at times; I felt like it was a video game trying to be like a movie.

On the other hand approaches the great video game-related theme, another well-generated idea alongside the brilliant cast, highlighting the main components to designing a loveable flick worth viewing in the cinema.Free Guy uses an enthusiastic pace towards introducing the blue-shirt Guy and setting us in a city of nonstop action-packed crime. There are bright and visually-catchy sequences involving explosions, guns and video game-styled action, either in the background or packed up at the front of the camera. Overall, the quirkiness is simply unforgettable.Audiences will also appreciate the constantly hilarious references, excellent songs and fun-running plot.

132,TheVictoriousV,"Fun but a bit too long, not to mention eye-rolling",5,1 October 2021,"The worst parts of Free Guy are essentially the worst parts of Space Jam: A New Legacy, except now it's a different megacorporation sucking itself off and complimenting its own products and IPs. But at least Space Jam had enough sense to not throw in obnoxiously popular YouTube gamers and Twitch streamers to provide playthrough-style commentary on the climax; to tell us how COOL the stuff we're watching is.The concept of Free Guy is an interesting one, revolving around an open-world video game NPC, named Guy (Ryan Reynolds), achieving sentience and breaking free from his routine to explore what the legendary ""players"" are up to. The player characters all sport sunglasses; when Guy procures his own pair, he begins to see (and soon interact with) a level of his reality he never knew existed - health packs, mission prompts, player stats, power-ups, the whole shebang. These are some genuinely amusing sequences, punctuated by baffled reactions from young gamers.The truth is, this idea would be perfectly fine for a short film or a Corridor Digital video (it wouldn't surprise me if there already is one). But because movies need to be bigger and longer than ever before (for some reason), it's not enough that an NPC simply breaks its programming and wreaks some hilarious havoc, gaining the attention of gamers across the globe - and also Alex Trebek.Instead, we also need a half-serious subplot about two young programmers (Jodie Comer; Joe Keery) whose sophisticated A. I. code was acquired by a major game company - helmed by an esurient Taika Waititi - and wasted on a GTA Online-type multiplayer game. The very idea of Disney satirizing corporate greed is more hilarious than any stupid reference throughout the entire picture.I also wish that the film had gone all the way with its video game aesthetics; either in terms of the graphics in the in-universe game world, or the way such a space might look if modern-day Internet-dwellers truly get to decide. I don't know much about these things but I'm imagining big-titted Among Us avatars, Wojak comics converted to hideous 3D, or if you wanna go old-school on us, purposely poor graphics à la Xavier: Renegade Angel. It's one of those ""out there"" movies that, all things considered, still look perfectly safe in terms of directing, visual effects, and actor attractiveness.Although the movie isn't quite so reference-dependant as Ready Player One or the aforementioned Space Jam film, Disney blows its load near the end of the show, throwing in Star Wars and Avengers imagery that reportedly made at least one audience clap and cheer with glee. They also play ""Wrecking Ball"" when there's a wrecking ball, but I don't know if anyone clapped to that. I'm guessing yes.Look, I know we're all very excited to finally be able to see movies in a theater again. I know that we often want more of what we love, even to the point where merely ""recognizing stuff"" equates to quality entertainment in some people's brains. I understand comfort food, comfort zones, escapism, complacency, and all that good sh-t. It just amuses me - in a dystopian sort of way - that we effectively clap like seals the moment we're being reminded, by a company that controls several avenues through which we get our entertainment, of the fact that the company indeed owns those things. There's nothing astonishing about seeing lightsabers, Avengers characters, or Chris Evans in a film owned by Fox, and therefore Disney.I hate myself for what I'm about to say, but I'm actually kind of starting to miss the days of Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, where the incessant references, while monumentally unfunny, at least created the sense that the writers were on pretty thin ice, legally - even with Fair Use in place - and a risk was being taken. Today, we're only being reminded of the growing power of media corporations, all to thunderous applause and Soyjak faces.",Free Guy

Sometimes I can feel that I am in a mood where it will be tough to laugh, but I was ready for a comedy today. I was invested enough in the story and appreciated some interesting video game tropes playing out, but it just wasn't the humor for me. This is especially surprising because I have historically loved Ryan Reynolds essentially playing himself, which is the case here. Ultimately, it is a feel good story that will keep your attention.

The screenplay and script is one of the best I have ever seen and it is carried out by excellent actors. But above all else this is pure entertainment. This is not high art. For that reason alone this movie deserve a high score, it is not often you see entertaining movies nowadays.Negatives; well I think it went a bit too far sometimes and I also did not like the music score. But the main negative is probably the directing. With this good of a script and with these actors, I think the movie should have been a lot better. I do not think it was bad, I am just saying that with better directing perhaps this actually could have won an Oscar...In total 8/10, which is probably slightly too high, it is a weak 8.

136,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Fun and cute.,7,14 August 2021,"It's a very fun movie. Especially if you like video games (whether you personally play or watch others who play), I think you will get a kick out of it. Theres a lot of fun references and cameos. Although, I think the youtuber/twitch cameos were a bit overdone. It was cute at first but they bring them all back a few more times and I was kind of over it. A)Theyre not actors, and it shows B)it kind of stops the flow of the story. I get they wanted them in because gaming is obviously an integral part of this story and these are big gaming youtubers/twitch streamers....but yeah...just a little too much for me. I think Ryan Reynolds is really funny in this. He's not breaking new ground or anything but if you like his comedy...you'll like him in this. Jodie Comer is absolutely adorable, I loved her in this. Taika Waititi was totally whacky and fun though a little over the top at times. Joe Keery was nice too. He still has Steve Harrington hair, but I liked seeing a more dorkier side of him. Though out of the main cast, I dont think he stands out as much.Story wise, its a very nice, endearing loving story wrapped in a silly package is how I can best describe it. The ending in particular is so sweet and I loved the subtle nod of Keys (played by Joe Keery) wearing a blue shirt. The mechanics of the world dont always make sense. But for the most part you can just kind of look past it and go with it. Movie felt like a mix of Ready Player One and The Truman Show.Is it safe for the kiddos? Well the video game world is definitely modeled after Grand Theft Auto. So there is a lot of violence...but its over stylized and mostly bloodless. (I say mostly cause there is a scene where Guy has a bloody nose). There is swearing in the movie (at least 1 F word, and 1 sh word) but mostly tame. There were a couple of kids in the audience and there was definitely a cameo/scene of a certain IP that definitely got a lot of giggles out of them. But that is more towards the end of the movie.Overall, a fun summer blockbuster. Nothing more, nothing less.",Free Guy

139,nidhunmoviebuff,"Witty, quirky humour over and above an ingenious plot!",7,25 September 2021,"Although the laughs reduce a bit towards the end, Free Guy is an immensely watchable comedy due to the excellent cast ingenuity in concept.Director Shawn Levy found the perfect leading man in Ryan Reynolds who depict a normal NPC (Non Playable Character) in a sprawling video game who becomes an AI program that goes rogue.Infused with witty, self-aware humour and aided by the charming presence of supporting performers like Jodie Comer, Lil Rey Howery, Joe Keery, Utkarsh Ambudkar and the brilliant Taika Waiti, Free Guy is critical of the emotionless video games of today while remaining wholesome and not taking itself too seriously.It is time we recognized Taika Waititi as a national treasure. After giving Korg and Thor Ragnarok (2021) and enthralling us in Jojo Rabbit (2019), he absolutely knocks it out of the part with an eccentric and quite nutty characterizerization of the main antagonist, video game billionaire 'Antwan'.Leading man Ryan Reynolds holds the film together with yet another amazing leading performance in a comic role. A victim of his own greatness, the weight of expectations were set so high after the Deadpool films that his recent flicks like Detective Pikachu (2019) and Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard (2021) weren't able to meet the audience's demands.He finally gets a role he could his teeth into and revel and does so with aplomb, playing the common man shade as well as nailing the eventual action hero persona he becomes.Jodie Comer also puts in a heavy duty performance as the femme fatale who captures the imagination of our protagonist, straddling the dual portrayals of both her video game avatar and real life version with requisite ease.Free Guy is a thorough entertaining, funny and thought-provoking comedy. Recommended!",Free Guy
140,AdrenalinDragon,Dumb fun if in the right mindset,6,11 August 2021,"Free Guy is the type of movie you know you're not meant to take too seriously and just go along with the ride. That being said, how much you'll like it depends on your tolerance for Ryan Reynolds. If you never found him funny, don't bother as he's loud, brash, slightly obnoxious, and very chatty in this. He has some good moments though, but a lot of jokes are very hit and miss, but yeah this is a silly movie and you shouldn't think too hard about logic stuff.The concept is pretty good, although not the most original thing in the world. The idea of a protagonist figuring out his whole life is a video game is cool and the film takes some advantage of being creative and wacky with the world and concepts surrounding it. There's product placement, references to movies, game stuff, and Twitch streamers in it, so yeah it's very corporate, but it didn't bother me much.Overall, I didn't dislike this and treated it for what it is. A fun silly blockbuster that doesn't try to be high art and just there to entertain. The film starts out decent but loses steam around the halfway mark. I wasn't the biggest fan of Taika Waititi in this, unfortunately. I was able to tolerate Ryan Reynolds, but any time he was the focus it became a bit grating. It doesn't all work and I'm sure there are plotholes and logic issues, but you know what I got some enjoyment and laughs out of it.6/10.",Free Guy

143,sirwillisiv,Your typical Ryan Reynolds fare...,6,25 August 2021,"Free Guy has a clever concept on the outside but its execution is incredibly average. Not horrible, not great, just perfectly neutral. Wouldn't recommend but wouldn't urge you to avoid either. It's pretty much what you expect from blockbuster fluff. Marginal humor, some exciting action in small doses but I felt like it could've handled its characters much more tactfully and presented a stronger commentary. For a fair chunk, Free Guy plays out like a video game-themed Truman Show and it did arouse my interest but a formulaic subplot ends up stealing the spotlight and left me somewhat underwhelmed.Overall, Free Guy's story primarily follows two estranged game developers trying to reclaim their stolen code from a big bad game company and it's just...okay. The characters - slightly marred by Hollywood's misguided perception of nerds and game designers - don't really share a convincing enough chemistry but they weren't painful per say. I've definitely seen worse examples of these kinds of protagonists. Well, their budding romance is beyond sappy and I think I would've been more on board with their relationship if it was platonic and there were more scenes of them interacting in person as well as a deeper exploration of their past. The latter is just crammed into one exposition-heavy scene that I forgot about faster than I can say ""Guy.""The comedy was really hit-and-miss for me. I only laughed out loud at one crude gag but the rest were mostly pokes at video games tropes that only got a smirk and a chuckle out of me. I really didn't like the Disney plugs and exaggerated YouTuber cameos. They were excruciatingly forced, not even remotely funny and they completely took me out of the film. The referential humor isn't nearly as abundant as Ready Player One, though. So, take solace in that, I guess. Now, it sounds like I hated Free Guy, but I really didn't. Admittedly, it frustrates me that it could've been a lot more intelligent and character-driven but I was entertained to a fair degree. It is what is: A harmless and fun popcorn movie. Your typical Ryan Reynolds fare. So, don't go in expecting more than that.",Free Guy

145,coasterdude44,An Existentialist Masterpiece,10,13 August 2021,"It has been a few days since I've seen it and wow did it exceed my expectations. Free Guy is an original and uplifting movie about an NPC in an online Battle Royale video game like PUBG or GTA Online. The character named Guy becomes self aware of his surroundings and wants to know more about the true meaning of the world he lives in when another character is introduced.Ryan Reynolds plays a very positive and likeable lead as Guy and I was pretty surprised how it got surprisingly philosophical and existential in the movie which you don't really see often in movies these days, though it wasn't extremely complicated and hard to follow like films like Tenet and Inception, yet the script and story were intelligent and funny enough to hold on their own.I also liked how Taikia Watiti played the villain and he was pretty funny, though not as funny as some other roles he's been in like What We Do in the Shadows, but his character was good enough though some of his one liner quip dialogue delivery was a bit awkward at times.Overall I think Free Guy is an extreme entertaining movie with existential themes and is one of the best films of the year which might even make you think twice before you kill the NPCs in Grand Theft Auto.",Free Guy

155,arabnikita,Ryan Reynolds strikes again,8,8 September 2021,"Free Guy (2021)Wow! I got to say that this Ryan Reynolds guy does know how to make a fun movie and not just as Deadpool. In this one, he plays Guy, an NPC (non playable character) in a huge and violent online game, who suddenly discovers that he can actually be the protagonist of the story. This might sound like some gaming mumbo jumbo to you but don't worry; even if you are not familiar with videogames, you will have a good time.I watched this film with two people who don't play any videogames at all and they were laughing just as much as I did. The story takes place in two worlds. The first is the videogame one, where we follow Guy who explores his new found abilities by trying to make his world a better place in an often hilarious way. The second is the real world, where the money hungry creators of the game are desperately trying to understand what made Guy self aware. All the fun stuff definitely happens in the videogame, but it is the real world that adds context and purpose to the rollercoaster story.The humor and action are non stop thanks to Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer who are the definition of the phrase dynamic duo. As a gamer, I definitely found a lot of niche humor in the subtle words, details and easter eggs; an extra point for that. What's more, the film is highly self-aware and even manages to mock the modern online games by showing how they sacrifice substance for money. What surprised me though, is how much it made me feel for these measly NPCs and the impact they have on the movie and games in general.

156,jace_the_film_guy,Effortless and Infectious,9,14 September 2021,"What a joy to watch! From minute one, I was immediately fascinated by Free Guy and invested in the story of the titular character. The film's effortless and infectious tone is largely driven by charismatic performance of Ryan Reynolds. The supporting cast was great as well and together they set the stage for an enjoyable 2 hours.It is impossible to watch this film and not make comparisons to the 2018 video game film Ready Player One. While the Oasis from Ready Player One was much more intricate and had a broader scope, Free City was still just as creative and fun. On top of that, I enjoyed the humor, casting, and overall tone of Free Guy more than Ready Player One (and I really enjoyed that film!)From a critical perspective, I was a little burned out on Taika Waititi by the end of the film. His character was one-dimensional, and his performance was overacted at times. As someone who thinks that Taika is a cinematic genius, I was disappointed with what he brought to this film.With cutting edge visual effects, spot-on pop culture callbacks and an instantly beloved protagonist, Free Guy has jumped to the top of my list of favorite video game films.",Free Guy

160,JurijFedorov,So many logical errors and plot holes that it doesn't fully hold up,6,28 September 2021,"The ideas behind the movie are clever. It's just a shame it suffers from the same problem as Ready Player One, it's a silly and over the top fake version of the video game and digital world. There are some cool things here, but the parody just doesn't work because it's extremely clear the writers and makers of the movie don't understand anything about video games, programming or the online world. There are for example a lot of real Youtubers reacting to the gaming world in extremely silly ways that make no sense at all. They are freaking out about things happening in just this one online game and the world is obsessed with the game for some reason even though they make it clear the game is actually bad. Even regular people seem to know everything about the game even though in our real world not everyone could even tell you what GTA is.Overall it's a hit and miss. Yeah, the good ideas work perfectly. The good acting is really good and the female lead is mind-blowing. But at the same time it has terrible and overly cringe scenes in it. It gets tiresome after a while to watch yet another real life Youtuber react to something that supposedly is happening in the video game instead of showing us more of the video game itself. And the reaction are so fake and silly that you can't take it seriously. It also gets completely ridiculously progressive and SJW when they mention stuff like patriarchy, not dating men anymore, all men being jerks, White privilege. It clearly tries to be ""important"" for progressives in that men and White people overall are the bad guys in the world of the writers. But then the lead is a White man and nothing happening in the movie is overly progressive in any way. They don't actually show White men being pigs, they just say they are. Except for the one other gamer who is a 22-year-old boy acting like some huge perver tnerd. They don't even show a newly lesbian character being lesbian because they likely want to aim at the Chinese market. But these random SJW words and terms are on the other hand aimed at the young American college students. It's just a mess. There is a really fun movie in here, but it's covered in a lot of crap and bad scenes too unfortunately. And you have to wonder why they didn't hire some actual gamer to show them what they did wrong.It also doesn't know what it wants to be. At times it feels semi-serious and works really well. Unfortunately half the scenes in the real world are overblown comedic scenes that are not funny and worse of all make zero sense. For example, apparently they can't shut down their OWN servers. WTF? You can only make changes to the game via programming. You cannot in any way shut down the electricity. But then that's not even true either because we clearly see that it is possible earlier. So what is possible or not here? They don't care, so we don't care. They don't care about any logical plot because they don't understand video games and whatever happened just happens for comedic effect. We never learn how this all works and why it even works this way. So it doesn't really matter. At the end if you know anything about servers you will find this over the top silly. But 40% of the movie is fun enough. The game scenes are cool. It's just that it soon becomes a parody of itself. If you play video games this will seem idiotic and silly. If you don't play video games this will seem pointless and boring. So they don't really have an audience. But it's an okay waste of time.",Free Guy

162,gcsman,This had more material in it than I was expecting,7,26 August 2021,"Nowadays there's no lack of 'comparison' movies to choose from for Free Guy but I'd say some good comparison forerunners in spirit and feel are Ready Player One (2018), Pleasantville (1998), A. I. (2001), and even all the way back to War Games (1983). But Free Guy is good enough to stand on its own, and you don't have to have more than a passing acquaintance with video games to enjoy it. Having seen the (fun) trailers I went in with certain expectations, but the movie as a whole went beyond them. The back-and-forth switch between the real world and the gamers' Free City was a lot more even handed, and the plot was more complex, than I expected. There's a Macguffin (a secret file holding the key to the way out of the final impasse), some outrageous cameos at the end, and a good sense of pacing. And the ending is just a little bit surprising, but it's a fair one for which the ground had already been laid.Ryan Reynolds is certainly the star lead and does quite reliably well by softening the edges around his usual movie persona. But the other cast members had stronger roles than I was expecting too, including Jodie Comer, Joe Keery, Lil Rel Howery, and a host of uncredited gamers out there to whom the Free City game means a lot. Taika Waititi, as the crass gonzo CEO of the gaming company, plays his role like a refugee from the Monty Python School for Overacting, but it's actually kind of refreshing given the cardboard-cutout villains we usually get in these kinds of movies.I'll give this ""only"" 7/10, just because it's not a major, life-altering piece of cinema: it's just a well done two hours of entertainment.",Free Guy
163,skullhead739,"a fun watch, but is missing a few things.",6,15 October 2021,"So to put it in short, free guy is a big pop culture film with A-class actors, budget and references for everyone. But it is far from perfect.The film starts out really interesting with interesting and slightly weird characters. The story follows Ryan Renolds being in a game and breaking away from his coding and being sentient. Which is a pretty cool idea if you ask me. The story progresses with some interesting parts and some slow and monotonous parts. Then ""guy"" develops a love interest in one of the games players and the story coincides with real life and the game.What I really disliked about this film and story is the God awful villain played by Taika waititi. He is a almost 50 year old man that acts as if he is 18. His scenes felt very forced, unrealistic and comical at best. The dude just cant act. Also the love interest with Jodie comers character was also very strange. She is a real life person that develops feeling for a video game character and that in itself is weird but she constantly rejects a guy in the real world but without spoiling does something out of the blue, forces love out of nowhere on someone she showed no interest in whatsoever. What the heck was the point of that? Your left with a weird relationship that turns out forced and undesirable.Overall the film was good with the idea, some funny moments, mostly Ryan renolds and the pop culture references were my highlight. But the lack of a villain, purpose and undesirable relationships make this movie just slightly above average. Worth a watch if your bored, but it's no Oscar winner either.",Free Guy

166,Spartan_1_1_7,Fun. Wholesome. Thrilling. Free Guy is one of the best films of 2021.,8,1 November 2021,"""Life doesn't have to be something that just happens to us.""Well, this turned out to be better than expected and I always love that. Free Guy (2021) is a movie about Guy who one day realizes he is an NPC in an open-world multiplayer game. Considering the premise and Ryan Reynolds as the lead, I was expecting it to be a goofy fun time, which it certainly was in parts, but I was not expecting it to have so much heart.The movie combines gaming and A. I, both things I love, in an enthralling way where you're hooked from start to finish regardless of whether you have predicted some of the plot points or not as the execution itself keeps you entertained throughout. There is this layer of wholesomeness deeply embedded in the experience that was so well done that I was feeling warm and fuzzy all over.Loved the performances from pretty much the entire cast. Ryan Reynolds once again shows he has great comedic timing as well as the chops for THE FEELS. Jodie Comer was lovely and might be a new celebrity crush. It was awesome to see my boi Steve-I mean Joe Keery after a long time and some of the stuff regarding his character and coding spoke deeply to me. Taika Waititi was hilarious as this over-the-top Studio CEO and I enjoyed how that part of the plot also acted as a jab towards the gaming industry whether it's pumping out unfinished sequels or lack of awareness for what gamers want etc.The movie boasts some splendid special effects. There is a ton of it and since almost all of it is in-game, even the wonky stuff can be passed as part of the experience making it a complete whole. That combined with a lot of crazy action and this was a blast watching it on a home theatre. The soundtrack was also nice with some great song choices, particularly Fantasy by Mariah Carey which my nostalgia remembered from Rush Hour... although a particular cover by Jodie Comer that was played in the third act made it even better than the original thing.What I appreciated the most about the movie was that it didn't rely on nostalgia or contemporary pop culture to dangle keys in front of you for superficial entertainment but rather had its own foundation where the film then incorporated some of it almost seamlessly.All in all, I loved it. It is a fun time but it is also more than that. One can go as deep into the themes and messages as they want even to the point of spirituality and mass awakening etc. But even if you don't, it's still a great wholesome/feel-good time overall, something that is sorely lacking in contemporary cinema from what I'm seeing and that is more than enough reason for me to recommend it strongly. Sure, if you have experience with gaming, you'll enjoy this more but that is not a necessity. Props to Shawn Levy, who I realize also directed Real Steel, another great wholesome movie, and Ryan Reynolds+team for making this. WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T! And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10.",Free Guy

170,isaacochoterena,Not so funny,4,4 November 2021,"The jokes in this movie rarely work, as does the story that changes midway through the movie.At the beginning, the story of this film felt very weak, but in the middle there is a drastic change and everything becomes very tedious, the film takes a long time to resolve the conflict leaving the protagonist aside. In this film there are too many characters, the interpretation of Taika Waititi is terrible, the film becomes predictable from the second half, the plot has some incongruities and various conveniences, the humor that the film uses seems very simple and childish to me, there is not much logic in what happens with the technological aspect that is developed, the story is tedious and the film is very long. Despite that, there are good special effects, some good performances and there is an implicit message that refers to how we see real life and how we can feel trapped in it, leading us to create a virtual reality where we forget what really matters.This movie was boring to me because it uses the formula, which is often used in a movie that aims to entertain the audience, where there is an endearing main character, a positive message in between, an underdeveloped romance and many conveniences in the plot.",Free Guy

173,hoernkeem,"Free Guy (2021, Shawn Levy) Reynolds scores another hit with hilarious action filled summer gem... not to be overlooked",9,6 September 2021,"'Free Guy' is the latest Ryan Reynolds action, science fiction, comedy vehicle and it costars Jodie Comer, Joe Keery, Taika Waititi and Lil Rel Howery. Shawn Levy directs, and he has primarily directed on generally average comedies such as 'Just Married', 'Date Night' and 'The Internship'. Most recently though he has been serving as executive producer on Netflix's hit show 'Stranger Things' which may be why we see alum Keery show up in this film in a prominent role. 'Free Guy' was delayed an entire year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was held away from many of the streaming services finally debuting in theaters only on August 13, 2021. I absolutely loved the concept and the cast. I am an unabashed lover of Ryan Reynolds and he is in his full on Ryan Reynolds mode here. This was an extremely fun film and it was very well made. It was funny as well as exciting and meaningful in a few spots as well, but also containing great action and special effects. It hit a lot of different notes well to add up to one of the best movies I have seen this summer and this year thus far.Guy, played by Ryan Reynolds, is a bank teller in Free City. Very quickly we realize that Guy is a non player character in an open world video game developed by a company named Soonami and it's megalomaniac head honcho Antwan, played by an extremely over the top Taika Waititi. Jodie Comer plays Millie Rusk known as Molotov Girl in Free City, and she believes that an original game she developed with fellow coder Keys, played by Keery, has been corrupted and illegally used by Antwan in his Free City game. Keys gave up and actually works for Antwan and Soonami now although he kind of hates it. Millie spends her time in the game trying to find evidence of their original concept that Antwan stole. One day magically Guy sees Molotov Girl and all of a sudden busts out of his prescribed NPC path and starts doing things on his own for himself. Many think he is just a user using and NPC avatar which he shouldn't be able to do. It is a revelation when they figure out this NPC has gained, in essence, sentience. It is also quite the revelation to Guy that he exists entirely within an unreal game world. Antwan threatens the entire game's demise and all NPC's along with it and thus it is a race to save the NPC's and find the evidence of Millie and Keys original game before Free City is destroyed. Along the way we get some great action and a lot of laughs. There are amazing cameos from some of the best public gamers in the business as well as Channing Tatum and Chris Evans and even Alex Trebek. It is a very feel good, get the girl, save the day kind of plot.This movie was a blast. It is a popcorn summer movie at its best taking the role of superhero and giving it to what is ostensibly a random everyguy although that rand everyguy still happens to be Ryan Reynolds. The game world is fun and interesting to see the characters interact in. I think it would be fun to see the characters in the game in some more mission style scenarios, but the open world concept without a lot of focus worked for the story being told here. I also really enjoyed Jodi Comer who is most widely known from the television show 'Killing Eve'. It is nice to see her breaking into movies as well as play characters that are not Eve. It is always nice to see 'Stranger Things' alumni getting work so I enjoyed Joe Keery here. It was a very organic use of a very diverse cast. About the only person I stumbled on a bit was Waititi's Antwan who was so over the top that it was cringe-worthy at some points although I am positive that is exactly what he was going for with the performance. The plot climax had me grinning from ear to ear for amazing use of iconic film props that we don't expect to show up outside of certain franchise films. How this movie was able to use them flummoxes me, but I love it! It is wonderfully feel good as well as tender in the end. There may be a few slight flaws, but overall this was a wonderful movie and I would very much hope they develop a sequel. A rare non-comic book hero is just what this summer can use.Eric's Grade: A-",Free Guy
174,torrascotia,Unwatchable for adults....for gaming nerds only.,2,26 September 2021,"I rarely turn off a movie however I lasted 30 mins and turned this off due to boredom.This is basically yet another computer game as movie expedition, however this one is strictly for the gamers. It will only be of interest to you if you are heavily into gaming to get the references and understand just what is being talked about.This stands in stark contrast to Ready Player One and Tron, which while using games as a backdrop for good story telling. Free Guy is just basically a CGI showcase filled with nerd speak and has no time for anyone who doesn't spend their time gaming.Its obvious that its gamers who are upvoting this trash....this is not even an average movie.For gaming nerds only.",Free Guy

176,elenaphysics,It is really good,10,30 September 2021,"I was not excited about this movie. I am not a fan of Ryan Reynolds but I kind of liked some of his movies (not Dreadpool).Anw, my expectations were low. I am not into video games.This movie is a mixture of many many many movies but it is also unique.This movie has fast pace, it is fun to watch and it feels good. I also enjoyed Taka Waititi (I think that is his name, I don't know if he is the director, probably he is , I am too tired to google it)
Anw this movie has elements from:
The Truman show
The Matrix
The gamer
Boss level
Wreck it Ralph
Alita the battle angel
The Others
The surrogates
and of course Tron: the legacy (which is actually the core of this movie)
Also a Lara Croft reference is quite obvious.All is there, it is obviously affected by all these movies and many many more (ok maybe except boss level which came out this year as well)
But the movie is not to be taken lightly as in a funny rom com, buddy movie way ,sets serious questions about what life is. How we perceive life. Could AI be considered conscious life ? Where does our world end? Do we live in boundaries we are not aware of? What is our purpose?The breakthrough guy made and ended up in that 'paradise island' is actually a metaphor for after life, since we see his friend there as well who was destroyed earlier.His love cannot follow him (because he is dead but unaware of it) and he continues to exist in a state of freedom and happiness.So the movie is much darker than it seems. And even if it feels good to watch a happy ending for once (because once the happy ending was the rule movies abided with and nowadays it became the exception) it stayed with me. It is not a movie for kids even though it has no violence however it is very deep trying to appear shallow.This movie will receive a cult status for sure.",Free Guy

A ""Grand Theft Auto"" style game that HEAVILY focuses on attacking bystanders? No one would play that, that's why so little actual gameplay focuses on civilians in those games.It's like whoever made this film knows about video games, they just never actually played them themselves so it felt unauthentic. Also, the vibe was a bit too ""Deadpool meets Wreck it Ralph"" for my tastes. Frantic energy all the time gets annoying.Disappointing overall.",Free Guy

His character and characterisation were great and he played it perfectly.Ryan Reynolds was Ryan Reynolds again. I'm not sick of him yet, so that was fine.Oh, and Dude was great too.

183,rmirchandani,A pleasant surprise,9,7 October 2021,"The 2021 film ""Free Guy"" starring Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer may be one of 2021's best films. It moves at a fast pace and keeps you on the edge of your seat till the credits roll. The film may give the viewer the illusion that it is a fun and goofy film, but it's so much more than that. Free Guy urges video game enthusiasts and viewers in general to spend more time in the real world with real people and less time in a fantasy world. The message of the film is deep and may also be emotional, yet it does not take away the goofiness.Much like Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", this film manages to pull out all the stops and gives the audience a bombastic third act. It featured surprise cameos, hilarious references, and homages to pop culture and a visually pleasing final fight scene. My favourite scene is when Guy wielded Captain America's shield, and then quickly pans to Chris Evan's priceless reaction.To conclude, Free Guy further exemplifies Ryan Reynolds comedic acting talent and Jodie Comer's versatility as an actress. It is a fun adventure for gamers and non-gamers alike.Final verdict: 9.0/10.",Free Guy
184,theredsky,Free Guy Review,5,27 August 2021,"It's a lot of fun but it does have a lot of issues. The first part of this film is very cliche and very boring. In fact, a lot of this story feels very cliched. It was easy to start predicting which story beats the story was going to hit and it usually hit those beats with the climax being kind of the exception. Ryan Reynolds is definitely having fun in the role. He has this infectious charm that makes it hard to hate him and while his performance is by no means amazing, he is definitely trying. The other actors are fine but I didn't really like Taika Waititi's performance. Usually I love his performances but this time, it felt like he wasn't even trying which sucked because he is the main villain. The references and cameos were definitely the best part of the film. Well, some of the cameos were fun while some of them felt really REALLY awkward. If you have seen the movie, then I think you know which people I am talking about. They all felt natural and not forced at all. I won't spoil the cameos but there is one doing the final battle that got a genuine laugh out of me. Speaking of humor, it is pretty hit or miss. Some of it is pretty hilarious and some of it really falls flat on its face. Another big thing the film has is its climax. It doesn't make a lot of sense but it's just a ton of fun. There are plenty of moments throughout this film that were just fun and the climax dials it up to 11. It's just a shame it takes a little while for it to become REALLY fun. If you enjoy video games or Reynold's style of comedy then I would definitely recommend checking this out.",Free Guy

Let me guess, I get your down vote because truth and logic don't compare to ""But it's Ryan Renolds, we love him, he's Deadpool, he is hilarious, he is the best"" he made a film you won't remember in 20 years, it's a pop culture cash-in for now, and you got suckered in if you thought it was a great made film worth more than one viewing.",Free Guy

The acting is reasonable.However, the movie never really shines. The main antagonist, Anton (Taika Watiti) is very badly acted, probably the worst performance I've seen from him (or anyone) in a long time. Now, I say that being a fan of New Zealand television. I'm used to New Zealand humour and I have watched a lot of Taika's work. This was just poorly done. I got what he was trying to be. It was more like a 1 dimensional sledge hammer than a character. He was the most NPC in the entire film.For my tastes, a much better and somewhat similar film is ""Boss Level"". It's got the humour and the action and the game elements to it. However, I found myself being more impressed with the story and enjoying the characters more. For something with a bit more feels and kid friendly, probably Ready Player One.If you are a big Ryan Reynolds fan and you want to see Ryan do Ryan again, this is your film. If you want warm and fuzzies without substance, this is a fun film. Just don't scratch too deeply. This film will be forgotten in 6 months. Worth a watch if you have nothing better to do.",Free Guy

I'd even go as far as to say it's one of his best ever, despite the simple premise and not so high box office results.I loved everything about it. Took a star from a perfect 10 because it was too short. It's rare for me to want something more from a feel good comedy and it's usually much worse than original, but in this case I want more! More of the Free city 1 and possibly 2. More of dinosaur paradise. More of Chris Evans, Channing Tatum and other cameos. More of sweet and awesome friendship between the characters, More of Taika Waititi, as this guy makes me laugh and a genius filmmaker.

It was a fun watch, don't get me wrong, but fun in a passable way and not an enjoyable way.Free Guy has a decent enough concept; what if an NPC in a video game becomes conscious. And while it might be an interesting concept on paper, it doesn't mean it could logically translate on screen. The jokes are what you expected them to be, and the story is exactly what you expect it to be. It's over the top and silly, but it has Ryan Reynolds playing a very Ryan Reynolds character, so that equals out.The logic behind how the game works, makes no sense. The conflict around the main story is pretty dumb. The climax and resolution was as if the writers had gotten lazy. And most importantly, the ""messaging"" that they try to repeatedly cram down our throats were pure cringe... like yea, we get it, please stop spelling it out for us.But again, it has Ryan Reynolds... so it's watchable... like, if you have two hours to spare with a bowl of popcorn on your lap.

He also tries to destroy the first game as Ryan Reynolds finds the Free World where you can do whatever you want and Anwar had previously hidden that. The love relationship is a nice touch as well.

The plot of an NPC in the game ""Free City"" becoming a living A. I. having a mind of its own befriending and helping a real life player who is playing the game to find a way to get credited for the game she and her friend created was just so cool. I also loved all the hidden stories about some of the characters they added in the movie. There are too many to list, but it was excellent writing. The actors in this movie were perfect. Ryan Reynolds is perfect in every role he plays, but this was one of his best. He played the character named ""Guy"" and the way Ryan portrayed his character was perfect. The other actors including, Joe Keery, Jodie Comer, Taika Waititi, Lil Rel Howery, and Utkarsh Ambudkar were all amazing, and a treat to watch. Lastly, this movie was hilarious. It had so many hilarious scenes that made me laugh out loud multiple times.I have only positives to say about this movie. It was an entertaining, absolutely hilarious feel-good film. I 100% recommend this movie to everyone! It is a great late night movie, or a good movie for a family movie night. I doubt it will happen, but I hope there is a sequel! Regardless, this movie was great and I am so happy I watched it.",Free Guy

206,mr-altex,I've got what I expected,7,25 September 2021,"Ryan Reynolds is great fit for these unusual romantic comedies. The puppy eyes and some profanity hidden behind those, nothing has changed since Van Wilder days.I am sure I am not a target group for the humor. Most gaming references I passed with ""ah, it's from that"" and can't recall if I laughed out loud once.If you are not familiar with the current popcultre around gaming and streaming, a lot of ""references"" will fall flat. And if you are familiar with it, it is even worst because everything will be predictable to the point of no laughter.Despite all that, it is a good afternoon entertainment. Perhaps more driven by the Jodie Comer and Joe Keery interaction fighting against evil Antwan by Taika Waititi. And at some point, Guy just blended to the background like a proper NPC.",Free Guy
207,andrewrye-06535,A Fun Ride,6,23 September 2021,"This movie had several items against it that I thought would hurt my viewing pleasure. I'm not a Ryan Reynolds or Taika Waititi fan and I don't do online games so I was worried it might go a bit over my head.We got a somewhat restrained Ryan Reynolds who's frequent swearing and 'look at me' persona was pulled back a little. I'm certainly not a prude but when swearing becomes normalised it loses it's power and effectiveness, which didn't happen here. The character of buddy felt a little awkward and for a minute I thought I was watching Kevin Hart, the similarity to the Jumanji character were a little unsettling and in danger of becoming a thing.There's a nice fast pace and if you don't think too hard a fun ride. The nods to other movies became a bit much and at times I was distracted by the references. From Tron, 2012 and Ground Hog Day to the cameos I wondered where it was original. At times it felt a little close to Ryan Reynolds usual vanity vehicle movies where every other actor pales into the background to elevate the Reynolds character.I thought the separation of real life and game world weren't obvious enough and wouldn't have been surprised to see a cross over somewhere. The real world should have been a little dirtier,a little more real. I wanted Taika to break out a little more but most of his jokes felt a little flat and the role a little too large for him. This has been done better by Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood and I suspect that's what they were aiming for, Although I am grateful the whiny NZ accent wasn't over done as it usually is (I can say that I am one) and getting tired of NZers being used as curiosities.The love interest between Millie and Keys didn't quite come off at the end as there was no obvious hints along the way and it was predictable. So the Guy Millie thing came off weird and probably should have been more a friends thing than love interest to support the eventual Key's and Millie getting together.The gaming lingo was also not overly done and I managed to get the gist of what they were talking about without getting lost in the gaming world. I see some reviewers complained that there was too much explanation, as a non-gamer it was good for me and kept me engaged.It's a 6 from me for the ability to keep my bum in the seat and lets face it. It's trying to use real people to play game figures so was always going to have issues.",Free Guy
208,BijeshNagesh,Sprinkled With Great Moments,8,28 September 2021,"Any gamer anywhere is sure to appreciate at least some portions of this great movie. Directed by Shawn Levy and with screenplay by Matt Lieberman (who also created the story) and Zak Penn, ""Free Guy"" was most definitely a 'super entertainer' flick.What Ryan Reynolds did with his character Guy was hilarious, thrilling, exciting, and suspenseful. I can honestly not exempt mentioning all the other characters in this 'movie game'.There were a few popular names like Jodie Comer (who played Millie), Joe Keery (who played Keys), Lil Rel Howery (who played Buddy), and Taika Waititi (who played Antwan), even an uncredited appearance by Channing Tatum (who played Revenjamin Buttons). Then there were numerous new names and faces all of whom performed on point. They each brought such energy, sharpness, and vigour to their roles that it often felt like I dove right into popular game cutscenes or live-play videos.Musical scoring by Christophe Beck kept the tension, camaraderie, and action going strong throughout this film. Noteworthy cinematography by George Richmond further enriched the look and feel of ""Free Guy"" 2021.The movie initially released in theatres, but I caught it when it came to streaming after September 28. While watching the film on Amazon Prime Video, I couldn't help but realize it was as immersive as some of my friends said it was when they watched it in theatres.All crews and teams did exceptional work on ""Free Guy"", including and especially the VFX, special effects, costume, makeup and hair, stunts, and CGI parties. Each 'pixel' was given due attention and that, I believe, lent this movie outstanding technical credence.""Free Guy"" was funny when needed and action-packed otherwise. It borrowed a little bit from everything and everywhere, and infused it all with high-end Gaming flair.It was a treat to watch this crazy movie - chilling 'Simulation Theory' vibes and all - carried by the incredibly talented Ryan Reynolds. Let's just say, I'll never look at an in-game NPC the same way again.So many 'goosebumps' moments, and that memorable ending... This movie is a must-watch for 2021.",Free Guy
209,Badr90s,More understandable for gamers,7,11 September 2021,"It's fun for everyone I mean it's Ryan, but the Idea of uncontrollable interesting NPC is something to be considered for video games developers and to be enjoyed in this movie.",Free Guy

212,Harry_Gleeson,Predictable but Enjoyable,7,17 August 2021,"Overall I thought Free Guy was a fairly enjoyable film, albeit a predictable one.The humour that Ryan Reynolds brings to this is typical of the man who has always brought such energy to all his roles. Deadpool being the fine example. And that's where the films shines most for me, the humour is infectious and the energy made me really enjoy the 2hr runtime.Performances are all fine, Jodie Comer again shows her ability in a different role, her chemistry with Ryan is great too watch and I thought Joe Keery played a role that was well suited to him.The visuals are fantastic, a very gaming world experience from the perspective of the gamers and the characters. Although I thought the film had a predictability to it throughout, Taika Waititi was uncomfortable to watch for me, he just wasn't suited to his role. But there's no doubting the film is entertaining.Don't expect a masterpiece, just know it's a film that you can go and have a decent time with.Quote - 'Don't have a good day, have a great day' - Guy.",Free Guy
213,brianjohnson-20043,"Cool cgi, funny moment, good concept and (unfortunately) sloppy script and execution",6,20 August 2021,"This film felt to me like the writers constructed the story for the sake of making money. I think there is nothing wrong or shocking about that focus. But I think they were so single minded that they overlooked or disregarded a lot of plot holes because they felt like most people wouldn't mind a few issues in the story if the film had CGI eye candy, some laughs and explored some interesting ideas (even if they're been done before). The film probably will make lots of money. But I found the execution lazy and ironic given that the antagonist of the story is a money grabbing guy who isn't focused much on details and other specifics which are necessary to really construct a fine product for the consumption of the masses.I'm no video game nerd or tech genius, but even I felt that a lot of the tech stuff within the story was dumbed-down or didn't make sense compared to a film like Jumanji of 2017. I'd say that Ready Player One had a more understandable world as well. And that one was also open world. Probably the most annoying issue to me, besides the villain being annoying not funny while they tried in vain to make him funny, was that the open-world type of game seemed inconsistent in its scale and openness. One moment for the story the gaming environment felt very small as if only about 500 people at one time ever play the game at once (so Guy could find his love interest when necessary), while at other moments it felt like it must be one if the biggest and most popular games and there must be millions of people within the same open-world environment playing the game at the same time all of the time because everyone was talking about blue-shirt-guy and he was referenced on Jeopardy. I'm guessing that due to the story following a non-player-character they didn't want to try to construct a story where there were multiple interactions of the main character in different game lobbies. That would be way too confusing. But they also made the game seem like the game would need to be like that, or need to be MUCH larger, because the gaming world didn't seem to that big. It also seemed to take the game makers way too long to believe that Guy wasn't a hacker but a NPC. The game mechanics which provide a loophole where a non-player could, under the right circumstances, experience the game like a player from the outside is an interesting idea. But It also seemed to not make sense and seemed like the sort of thing that a programmer couldn't possibly program by mistake. The female lead character missed way too many clues from her real world love interest for way too long. They mentions that avatars of the players of the game have glasses to distinguish them from the NPCs, but the movie doesn't stick to those rules for the entire film. I could mention other story issues that bothered me. I'm not asking for a story to necessarily be entirely realistic. It's not as if I post negative reviews about Toy Story or Wreck-it Ralph because the stories aren't real. I just wish that these film writers would create a world (whether real or fake) with a bit more consistency, clarity and logic behind the decisions of that world.",Free Guy

Ryan was absolutely hilarious playing guy who is just a video game character but has the same emotions as wreck it Ralph does . The rest of the characters and actors playing the games were so funny and very inspiring to videos game players like me who likes to play video games too. And seeing Chris evans in this movie was even more cool. And seeing marvel cameos and Star Wars cameos was just the thing I wanted to see . I did wanna see Deadpool make a cameo and saying ohh hello I'm sure your wondering why I'm here in free guy well I can tell you this I'm officially part of mcu which means I'm joining marvel studios but 20th century studios still owns me .Free guy is a summer movie hite.,Free Guy
217,chris_rowe-881-168820,The perfect movie,10,2 September 2021,"If an alien came down to earth and asked what a cinema was and what makes a great movie I'd just show them this, it's exactly what a movie experience should be, it was in my opinion an absolute pleasure and you're almost sad when it ends, I'm lucky to have a membership so may go back and get seconds or thirds.The plot is great, it felt niche when I read about it but I took my 68 year old mum and she enjoyed the idea to, I felt the parallels with real life and metaphors you could take from it were just awesome. There were so many messages you could take from it, they were all positive ones to.The sounds were brilliant and atmospheric if sometimes a tiny bit too loud but the visuals were beautiful, the design was flawless and the effects were just perfect. I'm unsure if this could port into an actual video game but it'd be a fun one. I loved the little nods to certain games and other films, I love the Groundhog Day sorta vibes to, it just worked and you just were hooked .The casting... I mean you couldn't have gotten anyone better than these two, this kinda film is RR bread and butter, he's so charismatic and easy to like and root for, effortlessly funny and just a joy to watch. I am a big deadpool fan and have liked him since 2 guys a girl and a pizza place. Then you have Jodie, I mean I'd put my house on her being a generational superstar for the 20's, she's so versatile and one thing is any style, any costume however far fetched she looks amazing, she can't look bad, she's so easy to like, I mean seeing a film with two of your favourite bada55es is a joy and they both play it to perfection. Their chemistry is just perfect, everything was just right.The dude character was great, the rest of the cast was great especially taika as the evil villain, again another two of my favourite comic actors was just a blast.However, my only thing I didn't like, I though keys was played well and acted well but that romance for me was totally unnecessary and felt a bit forced. I get how it worked in context but it just for me felt strange seeing a love story then another straight after, especially when you love her and guy together. It wasn't awful it ruin it or anything that bad it was just the one thing I was kinda against when it was over.This is what a movie should be and if you need any reason to get a bit of happiness in these times or worry about the cinema this is the film that you NEED to see.",Free Guy

The whole game is so unartistic, supposed to be a free world game where crime is everywhere they instead made it look like Candy Crush. I don't recall myself laughing at any of the jokes, they're not cringe they're just not funny. Ryan Reynolds once again being Ryan Reynolds not necessarily a bad thing but I'm kind of fed up with the guy.

223,ha77y73ad97,Easy going fun movie that leaves you with a smile on your face!,8,17 August 2021,"These are the types of films that Ryan Reynolds is born to be in! Fun, action packed, witty along with so much heart through out the movie and its great to sit back and watch the story unfold.The story was surprisingly strong throughout the movie thought this was going to be closer to Pixels than Ready Player One. The story effortlessly went from action packed game to strong character building to tender moments between the whole cast! The strong casting of Taika Waititi, Jodie Comer and Joe Keery shows the level that this movie wanted to go to and it certainly didnt disappoint. Along with standout performances from Lil Rel Howery in the supporting cast, which i can see this role originally being offered to Kevin Heart, but had the right level where sometimes Heart can go beyond that. Comer playing both roles to perfection with not just having chemistry with Reynolds but Keery as well, being Geeky 1 minute to a a game character the next. Taika is just a genius and encapsulated the man-child owner of the gaming company.Visuals amazing! They certainly lent on the gaming engines with this and even produced some campy old age action moments with clunky 2nd gen graphics but just worked well. Fun movie and gaming cameos through out this movie, the gaming ones are right in your face but the movie references will definitely be needing a second viewing to see, just from the cast list. Jump shots, sliding round corners and glitching into walls are just some awesome references that many people see daily.Overall its just fun, no other words can describe it, all ages will be able to watch and the jokes land on all levels. There were certainly moments where Reynolds falls back onto Deadpool and in hindsight I can see him wanting to have the character in this movie! Certainly better than many of the other movies that have been released this year, probably second to The Suicide Squad!",Free Guy
224,TheAnimalMother,More Than I Figured It Would Be,8,13 August 2021,I thought the preview looked like it could be pretty funny. It was much more than just that! Funny and somewhat thought provoking as well. The film is for the most part very good. It's Blade Runner meets Groundhog Day in a sense...but at the same time it does have enough of it's own interesting aspects. This film is basically as if a very modern Philip K. Dick met romantic comedy. I should also mention that the late Alex Trebek makes a short & memorable appearance. 8/10.,Free Guy
225,Benslie,The perfect movie to turn your brain off during,8,16 August 2021,"Okay, honestly this movie is just a wild rollercoaster of pure stupidity and I absolutely loved it. I'll start by saying that the pacing in this movie is honestly really good and it surprised me. The best way to describe the pacing in this movie is that it feels like a blink and you miss it kind of movie. It definitely has fast pacing which usually I would say is bad but it worked for this movie especially when it cuts from the video game world to the real world where the movie starts to slow down a bit. I will say though is that as much as I liked the fast pacing at certain points it does feel like they are bullet-pointing things just so they can quickly get back on track to the main plot. As somebody who doesn't play a lot of video games, especially ones similar to Free City, I didn't pick up on a lot of things actual gamers might've but the writers did an excellent job of balancing video game references and still keeping it an enjoyable movie for everybody. I do have to say that the acting in this movie was great. Yes, Ryan Reynolds still plays the same type of character he usually plays but it works and especially worked in this movie. But honestly, everybody in this movie you could tell was having a great time and not taking this movie seriously one bit. A real stand out for me was Taika Waititi, who plays Antoine, you could easily tell he was just having the time of his life with this movie. An issue with some comedy movies is that they show their best jokes in the trailer leaving nothing else for the rest of the movie and I can happily say that yes, some of their best jokes are either in the trailer or promotional videos but, there are still some hilarious jokes in this movie. In the end, Free Guy is a great movie to go watch and just turn your brain off for a few hours.",Free Guy

This is a funny action movie, not to original after ""Ready Player One"" (witch is a lot better btw), but humoristic referenced to The LEGO Movie, GTA-V and some more and cool action scenes that are totally over the top in a positive way. Bad thing is the casting, the programmer nerd (Joe Keery), totally failed in acting at all, cross-eyed Ryan Reynolds is not funny anymore, stop casting him.

I suspect half the references would go over the head of others. I am a gamer and found the jokes mildly amusing but overdone. Reynolds started to ramp up from his guy character into Reynolds ..,. The problem I have with Reynolds is that he is the same character with the same voice in every movie ... he is not an actor but a projection of himself.I would have liked more interaction of Guy in his virtual world using some skills but it was really focused on his obsession with a female gamer.The featuring of gamer product placement and twitchers was off putting, as were the woke statement such as ""toxic white culture"" and a few others.It was ok as a Reynolds comedy if you like him but I think he is a bit over done and one dimensional to carry future movies!",Free Guy

233,quiqueperezsoler,"This one goes out to you, gamers. A feel-good comedy with a surprisingly endearing story",7,20 August 2021,"What seemed like a Deadpool-like comedy with the backdrop of videogames became one of the most heartwarming and feel-good movies featuring the gaming industry.While at times cliche and predictable, the movie surprises quite the many character developments and story element to push the narrative forward. So while the premise is ""your typical premise"" involving the bigger problems in the Video Game industry today, the movie manages to work with these elements to tell the actual main story. With an absolutely amazing cast, characterization and well-placed cameos and references that don't feel overdone and actually feel relevant to the development of the plot and therefore, welcomed; the movie Shawn Levy created with the help of his crew is an engaging popcorn summer blockbuster, one I'm glad I saw at the very empty and unfortunately dying cinema.Lately, very few blockbuster movies prioritized characterization over plot. There are characters, yes, but they don't feel as real. I don't know what it is, with the main characters in this movie you feel for them, you connect. Maybe it's because I have been a bit out of the loop with the current releases. But recently, even Marvel movies/shows and other more blockbustery movies feel like the actors in it are just ""acting"". They are doing it very well but they are not ""emoting"" as much. Communicating their feelings. I don't know, maybe it's just me. I felt the characters in this movie (the main characters above all) felt real to me, and not because it was taking place in the actual world but because the screenplay, the actors, the narrative, the movie was constructed in such a way that is engaging to follow.Maybe I was expecting a braindead version of Ready Player One featuring Ryan Reynolds and less emotional baggage or development within it. This movie had something else to say, to everyone, and also about the status of the current gaming industry. I was and am seriously worried about the non-gamers or non-developers that want to watch this movie, I felt many of the concepts and things they said were very technical (more than usual). Normally, Hollywood would simplify the explanations that are told by technical people, like how they oversimplify hacking and the hacker dialogue. Perhaps with the arrival of streaming, the fact that more and more people are starting to learn the jargon and the fact the main target audience for this movie (let's not kid ourselves) were gamers (old and new, although the themes showcased were more current - from the past 10 years or so)IN CONCLUSION, I just hope everyone was able to enjoy this endearing love letter to online multiplayer gaming and was as pleasantly surprised to see a movie that had more content than continent. What looked like a mindless action randomly-shooting comedy turned out to have more heart and a deeper message to say. Don't have a good day... Have a great one!",Free Guy

240,MovieWarfare,"It's not a good time, It's a great time!",8,2 October 2021,"Video game adaption movies are notorious for being atrociously bad. There have been some good video game movies recently, but never great. Then there are video game movies such as Wreck-it Ralph and Ready Player One that are centred around video games. Free Guy is another video game movie that is centred around it. The premise is ""When a bank teller discovers he's actually a background player in an open-world video game, he decides to become the hero of his own story -- one that he can rewrite himself. In a world where there are no limits, he's determined to save the day his way before it's too late, and maybe find a little romance with the coder who conceived him"". So is Free Guy a great movie or something to be shut down?Firstly, the concept of an NPC becoming more self-aware is such a great idea. The whole concept is so intriguing and engaging but what amazes me is that Free Guy succeeds in the delivery and the landing. The story is also surprisingly good as Guy trying to gain the affections of Millie Rusk/Molotov Girl is quite sweet and endearing to watch. Additionally, there is a plot with an evil CEO that give the film the tension and stakes necessary for a very satisfying finale. What surprised me the most is how much emotional weight and heart was in Free Guy. Some genuinely emotional moments explore some deep themes about the purpose and meaning of life that I didn't expect. Furthermore, the characters themselves are great, with the exploration of the relationship and character development between them is an enjoyable watch. The action scenes are fun to watch and a fair amount of jokes does land as well.I love the amount of reference in Free Guy to not only video games but other movies too. There are even some references that wowed me. They also use a fair amount of video game terms that didn't make me cringe. I also loved that the director included very silly and funny things in the background as well which makes for great second viewing. The cast all do a great job as well and are incredibly charming. Ryan Reynolds is indeed just playing himself but it is still entertaining to watch even in Free Guy. Joe Keery is very lovable and plays a believable nerdy guy and is the one who I ended up rooting for the most. Jodie Comer is phenomenal though as she plays the passionate Millie and badass Molotov girl convincingly while being incredibly charming. She has great chemistry with Ryan Reynolds and Joe Keery which is what makes both scenes in the game and real-life enjoyable to watch.However, Taika Waititi who plays the evil CEO and villain is a mixed bag for me. Taika succeeds in making his character completely dislikable which makes him an effective villain. The problem is that he is very goofy and cartoonish which is a jarring contrast to all the others who give more believable performances. Most moments with his character are also not that funny and most never landed, unfortunately. There are also a lot of problems with the script just breaking its own rules. For example, it is shown in the real world that they're playing the game on a computer, not VR, yet during in-game scenes, characters act like they can feel stuff when it makes no sense. Moreover, there is one major scene that occurs that baffles me as it was clear from an earlier scene that it shouldn't be possible to do, yet it somehow still happened.Overall, I came into Free Guy with little expectation but was astonished at how much I ended up enjoying it. Even when the writing falters, the natural charisma of the cast keeps it from ever being monotonous. Free Guy is not just a good video game movie, it's a great video game movie!",Free Guy

242,j_movie,some feelings,8,27 August 2021,"Recently, I have seen too many art films at film festivals. Suddenly, I feel comfortable watching such a relaxed film. This may also be the significance of popcorn films. The exact definition should be ""a movie made of colored eggs"". After watching the beginning, you can roughly guess the end, so you can only constantly bring freshness to the audience by paying tribute and reversing in the middle of the movie. Overall, the entertainment is very good. Even if you haven't played games such as GTA, you can quickly replace it. I thought it was the concept of anti routine first, but when I think about it carefully, it seems to be trying to tell a hero story living in the present. I went back and found the possibility of NPC as the protagonist. The most striking point is that it finally falls on love. From this point of view, I think this is one of the most romantic love films I have seen this year, because there are too few good love films now.",Free Guy
243,monberger,Awesome Movie!!!,10,16 August 2021,"What a fun movie Free Guy is!!! Every second is entertaining, funny, and sweet. Reynolds again proves he is hilarious besides being a nice-looking guy. You care about every character in this movie even for those who have short cameos In it. The special effects are excellent; the music is fun. This movie it is a different concept and it works. Refreshing plot. I went to see it in 4DX/3D. It is a phenomenal experience. I loved it! This is the best action/comedy/sci-fi Of the year!!! This movie was supposed to come out last year, but they waited to release it, and it was indeed worth the wait. This movie is for the big screen.

246,dontakeitpersonal,Surprisingly watchable,7,2 October 2021,Not going into spoilers. But it surprised me that it was pretty good. Quite predictable but that is okay. The matrix motor kinda scene out of the window was acceptable. I wouldn't watch it a second time but it was entertaining.,Free Guy
247,c-kelsall,Top quality popcorn,8,19 August 2021,"Is Free Guy best described as a popcorn movie? Of course it is! But there's pocorn, and really great, satisfying popcorn that begs for a second helping. No, I'm not saying there should be a sequel (the originality of Free Guy, at least on the surface, shouldn't be eroded by money-grabbing sequels), but you might want to catch the same movie more than once.This is a pop culture vehicle which gently pokes fun at gamers and gaming. Now, I'm not, and never have been, an inveterate gamer, but I tried them out in the early arcade days, and was still dabbling when the modern complex gaming platforms like Unreal started to appear. Elements of numerous gaming styles appear in Free Guy, and it all seems to hang together quite well.Another thing for which Free Guy is a vehicle is Ryan Reynolds himself; he was born for this kind of role and could probably do it in his sleep. I wasn't so keen on his best friend Buddy (yet another comedian becoming an actor, who seemed to be channeling Kevin Hart the whole time - I'm not a fan of his either), but thankfully he wasn't a dominant character.Guy's romantic interest, played by Jodie Comer, was great, and the pair had very good chemistry, a factor which lifted this from an enjoyable couple of hours to something just a bit more interesting.Taika Waititi was also very good as the soulless corporate boss from hell, masquerading as a cool hipster with the heart of a gamer. What I wasn't expecting was that, funny though Taika Waititi is, his character here is jarringly off, like he's trying to be funny but not succeeding. I reckon it's deliberate, though, because it reflects the character he's playing - trying to create the impression he's a gamer, but actually it's obvious that's he's only interested in the bottom line. It would have been very easy for Waititi to have created a caricature villain who is likeable, but what we get instead is a finely crafted creation which is neither sympathetic nor seriously evil. He sits somewhere in the middle of a sliding scale of Waititi's imaginary Hitler from beginning to end in Jojo Rabbit.Free Guy has parallels with Ready Player One, but while RPO is an action sci-fi film with humour, Free Guy is a comedy with action. Both are full of pop culture references, and both play with the gamer stereotypes and cliches, but perhaps the most obvious thing they have in common is that both move the action effortlessly between the real world and the gaming world.There's a noticeably large dollop of personnel from Stranger Things included (who all do solid work, by the way), but it only occurred to me afterwards why that is - Shawn Levy directed several episodes of ST. I was particularly amused by the socially awkward man-child gaming a much better looking avatar (cameo'd excellently by Channing Tatum) from his mother's house. The same actor (Matty Cardarople) graces ST as a socially awkward man-child who runs a gaming arcade. I'm not seeing he lacks range, but he fits the part perfectly.I felt the weakest thing about Free Guy was a slightly straggly and untidy ending, but it wasn't a major part of the run time, and I had so much fun with the rest of it that I didn't mind.",Free Guy
248,margineanvladdaniel,"It started good, but",7,5 October 2021,"It was getting slowly into Ryan's style, the hero/good guy romantic stuff, exagarations, marvel references. It was not that bad, had a few laughs, but that was about it, the effects were good, but the story got predictable and boring. It could've been better, but also could've been worse, so, well done Ryan!",Free Guy

250,Luv2Spooge,Trailer didn't do it justice.,10,6 October 2021,"I was put off by the trailer, but the actual movie is just mind blowing. From the trailer, I expected silly jokes, slapstick, etc... Reynolds being Reynolds. However, I was surprised at how much more there is in the movie and how they were able to make a video game movie relative to the audience.There are other video game movies, but what made this one work I think is the great blending of real world and the fake world. They transition seamlessly from one to the next and bridged the plot so even the fake world matters because there is a real world consequence.However, what really blown my mind was how deep philosophically this film is, even more than the Matrix in understanding existential reality. Yet they did it without going into all Morpheus on us, rather in a very well done comedy that keeps you laughing to the end.Honestly, Reynolds is just Reynolds and he gets his part done, but I was pleasantly surprised by other areas such as the pink rabbit and Antwon. In the trailer they were quite out of place and just seem stupid, but in the movie, it was just hilarious when you see it in the right context. I laughed so hard when the rabbit showed up.The main antagonist Antwon came off like yet another cheap cliche comedy villain on the surface, but again in the film it revealed inside he is actually extremely intelligent, diabolically smart so it was believable he is the boss. This combines with his humor was a perfect mixture and his every line was just hilarious.My only complaint would be the ending. I thought the editing sequence was wrong. They should've ended the scene with Keys and Millie and then put the Guy and the security guard scene as mid-credit. I felt it hit the climax with Keys and Millie and would've been a perfect end.Overall, very well made. I am impressed.",Free Guy
251,PerryAtTheMovies,Worthy of a movie night for the whole family.....,7,13 August 2021,"(My Ratings)
Overall: 77/100
IMDb: 7/10
Letterboxd: 3.5/5Honestly, I think this is one of the few movies I could ramble on about so I'll just cut to the chase, but read the spiel below if you wish.Although it's not a perfect 10 of a movie. It's still a must-see if you're looking for a movie to watch in theatres. It's mostly family friendly. It's got romance, action, comedy, nerd talk, and overall just a really light-hearted movie that will have you forgetting about life for a couple hours.I had watched the trailer for this multiple times leading up to viewing this movie so I had high hopes. Probably a mistake, but you get what you get and you go from there.While I didn't cry laughing like I was hoping to. I did have a really good laugh throughout the film. It was light-hearted and full of fun. Ryan Reynolds of course brings his charm to the film that, for me, makes it hard to hate him.Chemistry amongst the actors was pretty good. While the performances weren't spectacular by any stretch of the imagination. Each main character/actor that interacted with each other worked well. Examples would be Ryan with Jodie inside the video game or Taika with Joe in the real world. But while the chemistry worked. At times the acting felt too rigid and lost some of the fun of the film, if you follow me.Visually the movie was stunning. Bright colours and the cheerfulness of the NPCs made things feel like you were inside the video game even though it was done as a live action. Less lighting and darker colours, per-se, indicated the real world. So you knew when you were in the game and not.My biggest like about the movie was the concept of the video game and the talking about how 0s and 1s run life. In the big picture it just made sense to me and me feel like I belonged.But seriously.... I think you should check it out. It's worth it!Enjoy the show....#FreeGuy #FreeGuyMovie #FreeGuyMovieReview #Movie #Movies #MovieReview #MovieReviews #MovieBlog #Recommend #WhatToWatch.",Free Guy
252,adamsmith-51004,What the s***?,7,1 October 2021,"Not quite as edgy as it might have been, Shawn Levy's video game comedy still gets by on an unwavering cheerfulness, likability and a steady stream of solid giggles. Reynolds is the real selling point of Free Guy. He avoids a repeat of his snarky, look-at-me Deadpool humour and nails a new kind of sweet naivety that's not unlike that of Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. Comer is also quite wonderful as Molotov Girl/Millie and is a fully fleshed-out female co-lead rather than simply a romantic sidekick. They make a fantastic pair.Bits and pieces do feel borrowed from many, many other movies. And Levy's careful, streamlined flow prevents Free Guy from ever becoming hugely outrageous, zany, or gut-bustingly funny. Perhaps all that wasn't necessary, however, to maintain the movie's sweetness. The films overall messages of kindness, nonviolence, and free choice are always refreshing.",Free Guy
253,pronitmallick,Good Enough,7,28 September 2021,"Free Guy is a ride of joy that starts with making you engaged to it's worlds and making you ask questions to the fullest. The first act packs enough punch to make the audience hold their seats and enjoy the popcorn all the way. Right into the second act pacing seems a little slow but it gets right on track in the third act. All the actors in the film, especially the main attraction Ryan Reynolds have done a wonderful job that totally suits this free world. Starting from character introduction to character development, all of that has a good impact into it. Director Shawn Levy has created a world that has enough feel to make you vibe all the way to the end of the movie. Talking about the story, it is good but not something too unique, considering the story is quite predictable and so is the screenplay. In the end what carries this film all the way to the shore is it's good presentation and direction from the very start to the very end. In terms of watching it will differ from person to person but it is definitely watchable for at least once.",Free Guy

256,maakus,The definition of cringe.,4,25 September 2021,"In the 1980s and 90s there was a phenomenon with older people rapping in an attempt to appeal to a younger audience. It didn't work and it was hella cringe.I'm a gamer born in the 70s and i'm still up to date with games, gaming platforms, streamers, youtubers, and so on. With ""Free Guy"", i get the same feeling as old people rapping. To include Ninja, Pokimane and Jacksepticeye and making references to Fortnite, Portal, and so on, doesn't sit right with me. It's cringe. I don't relate. It's dumb. It's the older, out of touch generation, pandering to the perception of ""What kidz like!"" today and missing the mark. But heck - i guess it's worth it when the Ninja, Pokimane and Jacksepticeye fans manages to inflate the score enough.I like Reynolds and the idea was interesting, but this was beneath him, this was not fun, this was not cool and this was bad.",Free Guy
257,rchosen-193-5535,"Not great, not the worst either. Split down the middle.",5,1 October 2021,"I never had much interest in seeing this really. The trailers didn't do anything for me. You know when movies try to do video game scripts, they tend to be pretty bad. That said there isn't much going on right now so I finally got around to see this movie our of boredom.Having low expectations, I have to admit, it was better then I thought I'd be. Had some nice video game references in it and funny background issues you deal with in online games. Like walking into an object over and over due to lag. And while I love Ryan, I don't think he was enough to really save this movie. And the tiny scenes from gamers on Youtube was cute, but still felt a bit off.While the movie was great with its gaming stuff, it just wasn't enjoyable enough that I was like ""This was an awesome movie!"". It felt more like one of those summer movies you watch and forget. Again, I'm not saying its the worst movie ever. But it just sort of felt average at best.If you want to see it just for some gaming stuff in it, may be worth a look. But don't expect much else from it. The story is kind of flat, the music is all over the place, the characters feel off and weird. Thankfully my friend got the movie, so I didn't waste any money on it. I can't see me spending like $10+ for one ticket to see this sadly.",Free Guy

260,blackoutH,Deadpool formula without the R rated,4,7 October 2021,"The concept of Free Guy is actually interesting and fun, a background (NPC) character in a video game suddenly realizes he has been stuck on the same loop he has been programmed to follow.The opportunities to explore the subject are endless, and even though I wasn't expecting some deep philosophical questions from the movie and that it was more like a fun / ""brain shut down"" type of flick, I still didn't enjoy it.No matter how likable Ryan Reynolds is and how fresh Deadpool was, it seems that whatever movie he is in the type of jokes and delivery is always the same.For me they didn't land, the movie seems to be made for a teenage audience (nothing wrong with that, it's just not a personal taste) and also it relies on very stereotypical gamer assumptions, I know that some movies are just made for fun and not to give much thought, however if the fun doesn't work than its not a good experience.The love story is also very cliché and the ending was a bit cringe and expected to say the least - seems like waste potential to me but perhaps I went in with high expectations.",Free Guy

Every second interested!I can also understand those who do not like. If you don't like gaming don't understand much about this!While this didn't bother too much with the side characters ""that are an integral part of the story"" quite too much, this still worked perfectly!I hope, outright praying, that a sequel would be made somehow !!!This will definitely get a 4k record on the shelf !!",Free Guy
262,Wirxaw,There was no Steven Ogg.,5,27 September 2021,"I can't really hate this movie, but I don't appreciate the ""so bad it's good"" mentality, or the cringe. I want to like this movie as a ... ugh... representation(this word might as well be associated with sieg-ing nowadays) of the gamer culture, but... this is basically the equivalent of the 9gag Meme Rock. It could be consumed for fun, laughed at, ""I get that""-ed. But it's an atrocity to remember or to actually relate to. Definitely *not* something to support and encourage.Let's get something sort out first - few franchises or sources have a working concept of a gaming world, be it real or fictional. Some may do it right, and I don't know them, some may try to be creative... like Sword Art Online or Ready Player one... and some don't try at all. That's Free Guy. You may feel discomfort reading this, but in reality this movie is nothing more than a Reynolds\Waititi fooling around for a camera and some *censored*s getting promoted. Heck, when I googled the subject - I saw some pokemone or something listed as *second* in the cast. And that struck me as odd, because it's a bad sign. I remember watching and reviewing some kid movie here that also tried to star some pop idol and that was the only thing people talked about concerning the movie. Either ""the movie was bad"" or ""hey she was there"". Well, Free Guy is that multiplied by cringe.Besides, right off the first few scenes... I felt like I was watching some youtube spoof. Something by Corridor Digital or somesuch. In fact, they did a GTA Online IRL ages ago and... guess what, it was better than the movie, surprise-surprise. And while I could forgive the boring CGI, while giggling at a car that changes colors and other video game spoofs, after all - I'd like to see a movie about GTA Online... it turned out into an incoherent mess.Pretty much combine the worst parts of SAO, RPO and Ralph Breaks the Internet and you get the Free Guy. And let me explain - the worst part of SAO is the AI. Naturally. Go see if you can slog through Alicization. The worst part of RPO... is the romance. And the worst part of RBI is, obviously... the ads. The whole cartoon felt like a massive advertisement, but... at least it had its heart in the right place, which isn't what I could say about the Free Guy.The AI subject in Free Guy is so bad that it's just... false. One could think that when the stoned writers wanted to put cringe on top of cringe, insert as many virgin and hikki jokes as possible, show as much insecurity as the screentime could allow... they could at least present an idea that the fans of the genre could appreciate. But, like Warcraft(the movie), this isn't for the fans - it's... for everyone else. For their absolutely manipulatable fantasies. I can't say more without the spoilers, but I didn't like the ending, because it was more fake than G-Force.The romance... ugh. I can't say much without spoiling, but imagine RPO, but with a standup comedian's share of virgin jokes. I may appreciate the morale, the message, but the delivery was just too cringe. Or maybe I watched too much Loki.And then there's Reynolds. He's a great actor, I'll give him that. But he can play only himself. And when it's in an honest ""but why"" from a proper comedy - his acting could be thoroughly appreciated. But when he's given a role that's much greater than his acting range... it just feels forced. It's like you are supposed to empathize, but the writers have put all points in comedy and 0 points in charisma.Finally - the world. And this is what probably pains me the most. Like I said - I'd like to see GTA Online. But instead of GTA Online(and they tried...) - I saw some desperate attempt at stuffing in as much CGI trivia as possible, like RPO, but what's worse - I saw some kind of stupid... mobile game design. Almost VR, almost, but we aren't at the point of VR yet, and neither is GTA. What is there, however, is some stupid, potentially asian, mobile game. Yes, perhaps it was made that way on purpose, because, like I said - this isn't for the fans, this is for everyone else. So they could understand, see these flashy things, imagine that this is what the gamers see. And that's what completely ruined the world for me. Instead of showing some real GTA or generally MMO action, instead of trying to show the game from a player's perspective... they made a spoof. Merely a spoof. And, no, a player running into a wall and his textures glitching from a lag - is not a perspective. It's still a background spoof. Which I did laugh my buttocks off to, but that's not enough.So, again, it's not a bad movie. It's a salad of pretty much all kinds of things, trying to appease all sorts of audiences. It's funny, it has action scenes, like a youtube spoof - it can be watched frame by frame... But at the same time - it's not a movie. It's not a statement, it's not an achievement. To the point of, again, embarrassment of being related to that. I'd like to say ""but this is an indie movie that tried its best"", but 100mil$+ isn't indie. It may be neither Ralph's or RPO's 175mil$, but it's in the same league. And both movies did much better with their subject and their resources. I wish I could say ""but what if they dropped the ads, the AI, the romance subplot and focused on things that matter"", but the producers aren't stupid. You think Antwan is evil - he's like a pussy cat compared to the real Hollywood and video game corporats. Most modern movies don't have a goal of being ""the best at what it is"". They have a goal of reaching the largest audience and reaping the biggest buck. And this is what the Free Guy succeeds at. Hence my impressions.",Free Guy

265,jaywensley2004,"""The Matrix"" Part 4",8,16 August 2021,"20 years on, we have a fourth movie in the ""Matrix"" franchise.I've watched all the ""Matrix"" movies several times, always looking for an answer to the question ""How do we know that what happened to Neo was real?"" The basic premise of those movies was that humans were being used as batteries to power the machines that had taken control of the Earth. The machines kept the consciousnesses of the human batteries occupied by engaging them in virtual realities.Red pill/Blue pill? Nonsense. There is nothing in those movies that establishes that what we saw was anything other than the VR in which the machines were immersing Neo.The new movie ""Free Guy"" addresses EXACTLY that complication. It also makes some excellent points about what e-devices are doing to humanity, and the path we are headed down. To wit: what happens when we become able to upload our consciousness into cyberspace?I can't say much more than that about the film, because it would involve too many spoilers. But I will say that ""Free Guy"" is very smart, very entertaining, funny, and but for a few plot gaps (Why do Guy and Molotov ever take off their glasses?) and a high-concept Hollywood ending, would be a great movie.",Free Guy

His awakening brought upon by a gorgeous gun-slinging heroine takes us on a journey of questioning the fake world of video games.The cameos, the over-acting Taika and security guard, the good coders versus the evil ones, and every other MVP give the film another dimension of awesome, while the players, mostly in the background, or mother's basement, blossom as total maniacal, aggressive, selfish and unlikable minions.From non-playable character to the most valuable, this corporate-destroying computer program demonstrates the love and care trumps violence and hate.

278,sme3,An Amazing Technical Achievement and a Grand Entertainment,8,14 August 2021,"The realistic-looking virtual world of FREE GUY is an amazing technical achievement, but the storytelling craft on display is perhaps more remarkable. While convincing the audience of the unreality of its world and some of its characters, the filmmakers simultaneously make the audience care about those unreal places and people. There are thousands of ways this film might not have worked. Remarkably, the filmmakers found the way that did work. Certainly, Ryan Reynolds' performance anchoring the film has much to do with selling this impossible tale.",Free Guy

The story is really weak and you can see the way it's all heading very early on.I'm sure kids will get a kick out of it, but it wasn't the kind of film I enjoy, too watered down for me.",Free Guy

This is not that but a very original premise, it almost felt like a Pixar or Wreck It Ralph but live action. Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds but not so much that he is Deadpool for 2hrs. The pacing was great and the progression of the characters and story inside and outside of Free City was very well done. Good to see Steve Harrington outside of Stranger Things and Taika Waititi being a villain. The only thing that bothered me was the cheesy ""kiss each other and the movie becomes a love conquers all"" deal. Other than that the film was a nice addition to Reynolds resume and an all around good film that can be watched many times. I would disagree that it deserves a higher rating than The Suicide Squad of recent but that's just me. 7.5/10.",Free Guy

289,Bek204,"A very fun film. But, expected more",7,25 August 2021,"Free Guy is FULL of cameos, details, and easter eggs that are shocking and they are so many. From famous YouTubers/gamers/streamers to famous actors/actresses who appeared for a very short time and some of them voiced a few characters. (There is a HUGE surprise cameo at the end of the film that I'm dying to spoil but I won't)The film is very fun to watch. It's funny and entertaining especially that it's about ""Video Games"". Loved how the film reminded me of a few other films like Ready Player One (2018) and the video games Grand Theft Auto ""GTA"".However, my problem with the film is sometimes I felt like the lines/dialogues were cheezy, cheap, and weak. Which made the ""script"" ugly to me. Also the choices of the songs were really bad, there are so many other songs that would've fit way better. Sometimes ""old"" (and I mean very old, not 2 years old but more than 5 years old) trends were used in the film which made the film even worse and not funny though the use of these trends in the film was to make us laugh. But, the trend is dead so why use it?. Honestly, I expected a film like that to be funnier which is a thing that disappointed me. And lastly, the first act of the film was so bad, not funny and boring. The story seemed like it was heading to nowhere but of course after that everything started to be clear. Which bothered me because the first act should usually be the one that grabs the viewers' attention.Loved how the film has so many charters and it focused on and all of them and just one. And choosing these actors/actresses to play these roles were all great choices. Taika Waititi is great as usual, really loved the way he presented his crazy, TOO MUCH, bossy head of the company character. It really fits Taika. Lil Rel Howery who always gives any film the comedy side did a great job at making us laugh. His role in this film really reminded me of his tole in Get Out (2017). Jodie Comer who was a complete surprise for me, and I could tell that she will have a bright future, felt like her acting was so real, genuine, and convincing. And finally, Ryan Reynolds who is for sure the perfect GUY to play ""GUY"". Don't think I have to say much about him because everyone knows how funny Ryan Reynolds is.My rating is 7.5/10.",Free Guy
290,nigepitz,A bit too Ryan Reynoldsy,7,27 September 2021,I love RR. He's a funny guy. But half way through this movie I wanted him to do something different. I am not a gamer and don't understand that culture so I can't comment on that aspect but it was a relatively enjoyable piece of fluff with some funny moments and decent action. It was all just a bit underwhelming. Jodie Comer was a knockout though.,Free Guy

It was executed so well, it revolved around a relevant topic, it was funny, it jerked some tears out of me, and the ending had me grinning from ear to ear.The entire cast did superb! Yes, Ryan Reynolds was the outstanding star. But everyone else did really well. The movie was absolutely a team effort.This felt like a movie worth watching and rewatching.

When we saw this movie in the rental line- up, we saw the rating, watched the trailer and decided to take a chance on it. Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer are simply wonderful in this movie. Some reviewers here ripped it apart because it wasn't edgy enough, not enough like Deadpool (which I hated), and was just all CGI. Well, nerds? Maybe it wasn't enough ""fun"" for you, but my husband and I laughed our butts off and simply lost ourselves in the love story and the coming of self-thinking AI story. It was obviously not meant to be some sort of statement like Deadpool, but simply exactly what most people look for in today's rotten environment, politically and with all the terrible things going on in the world that nobody seems to care about (Afghanistan, anyone? Talk about a real life heartbreaker), but just plain FUN. And for two hours, we were lost in that fun world!

302,Toph-22,Convincing,8,22 August 2021,"'Free Guy' is the kind of movie that you either like or dislike. There is nothing in between. 'Free Guy' could convince me.Video game adaptations or movies that are about video games often have a hard time being convincing. This is often due to the fact that you can't identify with the characters or that the world created in the movie is not compatible with the one in the underlying game.'Free Guy' is not based on a concrete game, but it uses classic video game elements and realizes them really well. You can identify with the characters unexpectedly well and it's fun to accompany them.The movie doesn't even try to create a world that is as realistic as possible, but deliberately invokes a video game look. You know from the beginning what is going on here. The rules that prevail there are immediately understood and accepted.Basically, you should not expect a masterpiece. The movie is fun and entertaining. The basic plot is nothing extraordinary and it is relatively quickly clear what the movie is working towards. However, the way the movie reaches its goal is really elegant and charmingly realized.Not every gag ignites, but there are some laughs. 'Free Guy' also delivers some surprises, allusions and cameos. Taika Waititi as a counterpart was unfortunately too over the top for me. A bit more seriousness would have done his role good.Apart from a few weaknesses, 'Free Guy' can really convince. You have to be in the mood and want to get involved with the basic topic.",Free Guy

304,lbenot,Very Entertaining!,10,18 August 2021,"This thoroughly enjoyable, well-cast/well-acted unique fantasy combines a clever and intelligent plot/premise (a rarity these days) which is supported by terrific cgi, rich visuals, a welcome absence of gratuitous blood spatter, multiple positive themes, humor, and start-to-finish, genuine charm. It has trace elements/themes reminiscent of Tron, The Truman Show, and The Matrix, but clearly stands on it's own.Another natural role for Ryan Reynolds to excel in, but also enjoyed the villain and his dialog and mannerisms, as well as the young female lead, the two male supporting actors, and the rest of the cast, talented and convincing, all.

The sardonic writing of Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn also ensures that the limited locations of the film feel gargantuan in scope in addition to the clever direction of Shawn Levy; the film even takes some unexpected turns if you don't judge movies by their trailers.If you're one to voice the talents behind the numerous original screenplays that are turned into movies every year, both mainstream and obscure, this will be a must-see while it's still in theaters and when it comes for streaming.Rating: 3.5 out of 4 stars.",Free Guy

I loved the comedy, it was hilarious. I loved plot and the story. We finally got a new original movie. The movie is so original. I loved Blue Shirt Guy and I loved Jodie Comer's character Molotov Girl and her performance was great. I really like even though the movie was PG-13, the movie was still like Deadpool when it comes to the humor and the language. When Blue Shirt Guy pulled out Captain America's shield and became strong like the Hulk and then the lightsaber, a lightsaber! I lost my mind. The music was a great touch too. I loved all the characters, the performances, the plot. The plot's just so original. Ryan Reynolds was phenomenal. Ryan Reynolds did it again.

Just the symbolism that caught my eye and if you wanted to know what's up. Also there was one scene with the letters on the table (the child's game to make up words, big cubes) and I didn't research into the meaning of that.Though overall pretty fun movie ngl I loved it, because I wanted to relax and just have entertainment. I love the part of the movie where the main villain doesn't even seem like some actually super evil dude. But he was a just a greedy hipster. So be sure to have that kind of mindset, special effects were dope and acting was pretty nice. Also remember that it's not like a big detailed story, it's just an episode in a world. A perfect example would be when you walk by some people in the street who are talking and you overhear them, you understand what they are saying, but there's a lack of context for why that conversation even started.

314,guskeller,Formulaic to a fault and largely forgettable,5,18 August 2021,"Formulaic to a fault and largely forgettable, Free Guy comes across more as a bland product of consumerism than as a piece of art or entertainment. There may be faint moments of humor and emotion that keep this movie from being a complete waste of time, but that is drowned out by the script's predictable and unimaginative nature. Additionally, there is a distinct lack of vision in this film as it plainly displays its story in the most standard ways, rarely striking the audience visually. Fundamentally, it feels like everyone involved in this project was driven by their paychecks rather than passion.From a technical standpoint, Free Guy is largely adequate as it possesses decent special effects, amusing soundtrack choices, and coherent camera work. Meanwhile, the design of our video game world (where the film primarily takes place) might not be ugly but is noticeably generic. Really, the only thing to note from Free Guy is the fact that Ryan Reynolds is the lead. His charm does manage to occasionally shine through, but the cast is largely called to stick to the bare basics. In the end, Free Guy is missing the genuine heart a movie needs to connect in a lasting way.Writing: 3/10

Watch this movie for a nice fun time. The film provides an enjoyable experience by incorporating some vivacious music that compliments the influences of various video games and well placed cameos towards the end. Of course Ryan Reynolds (Guy) provides his usual jolly comical appeal, which is what we expect from him in every character he plays. The story flows well finding a balance between: action, comedy, plot development and love.I personally enjoyed watching this film, it did an effective job in showcasing the the elements of how video games function especially Non Playable Characters (NPC's), who would've thought they can do it so well within a movie though. It's what you'd expect it to be.Therefore Free Guy provides an easy going film that delivers a different idea. Attacking this concept was displayed well by not just focusing on the action/comedy element, although they did a fair job with that! If you're a Ryan Reynolds fan, no question, watch this.",Free Guy

1. If you are a gamer or programist, or just anyone that understands basics of using PC you will immidiately notice all the gushing nonsense and silliness of the plot.2. Quite a few of ""oh my god, why would you ever say that. It's so creepy and disgusting"" cringy jokes. Those were most definitely not part of the script, as noone would ever allow this to happen. So my guess is Ryan and his guard-buddy just received a few ""make a free-style joke"" moments. It was awful decision.And even with all of that, as a gamer, I truly enjoyed it. There was tiny, fleeting waft of woke ideolo, but so miniscule I didn't really care. It was 2 hours of fun, really.People compare it to truman show and, although there is some resemblance, i'd suggest not to compare them as you watch the free guy.",Free Guy

Also, since when are entire movies just based off what the protagonist's personality is? Producing Free Guy makes mathematical sense after all, it's got funny elements, is an extension of Ryan Reynold's personality, has great references to other movies and barely takes the risk of creating something original. It's the perfect popcorn movie, watch, chuckle and forget about it.Despite that, I enjoyed the movie since I like the Ryan Reynold-narcissistic type of comedy (this could change soon if he makes too many movies of this type). It's got numerous pop culture references, which works for me. And while the movie is great for a random I-can't-find-anything-else-to-watch kind of day, it is also a romantic comedy, and I love that.",Free Guy

Well that's because I honestly didn't like Key's that much and would have preferred if Millie ended up with Ryan aka Blue Shirt Guy aka Guy instead of Key's even thou Guy is simply an AI. Secondly is while most of the cameos were really great especially Chris Evans small scene. A lot of the Youtuber Cameos were just weird and felt forced into the movie so that their respective audiences would want to watch it.DanTDM, great cameo from him. JackSepticEye, another lovely cameo there, the man has a awesome accent. Ninja aka Tyler Blevins, felt super forced and included just so Ninja fans would want to watch the film to see him. Pokimane, seriously now come on... there is only one reason she was included and given a cameo role in the film. We won't say why here, but anyone with half a brain cell can figure that one out!Anyway enough ranting on weird cameos, the movie itself is great and fun the whole way through so I would definitely recommend it to everyone!8/10 from me and go enjoy yourself in the world of free city!",Free Guy

Ryan Reynolds is perfect for this role, and the other cast members do great. This movie's comedy is one of the best I've seen in a while. It offends generic stereotypes for video game users in hilarious ways and pleases many fans of different games and pop culture related things, while still entertaining a wider audience who may not play video games often. The story was engaging, only issue with me was the reason behind Guy's code being broken (bit cliche) but still it was enjoyable. Action was amazing on the big screen, so glad this is a theatre exclusive for now, I don't think you'd appreciate the action and sound on a tv but when you watch on the big screen, it is more enjoyable and engaging. Awesome movie, highly recommend!",Free Guy
348,JoelAlexanderr,The feel-good film for summer 2021 with a typically hilarious Ryan Reynolds,9,24 August 2021,"One glance at FREE GUY, the newest big budget offering from Hollywood's favorite action-star/comedy master Ryan Reynolds, will cause most to approach with valid skepticism. The plot seems like a cheap knockoff of films like Ready Player One or even The Matrix, but made in a crude fashion to make more money at the box office. The actual movie, however, could not be further from the worst estimates. Not only is FREE GUY constantly hilarious due to Reynolds and an inventive screenplay, and not only is this possibly the feel-good event of the summer, but it also has a considerable amount of thought put into the meaning of its premise and places a mirror in front of modern-day video game culture.To put it simply, perhaps the main reason this movie comes together so well is because of Ryan Reynolds' constant charisma and hilarity. Most of his dialogue is clearly either written by him or created by him on the spot (I have no idea how he hasn't received a screenwriting credit for this and the Deadpool movies), and the film is that much better as a whole because of it. He also interacts with the other actors in the film very well, including Jodie Comer and Joe Keery, two underrated actors who prove here that they aren't just one-time stars from their respective television shows (Killing Eve and Stranger Things). The ensemble combines to create the most consistently funny movie of 2021 so far.However, this movie isn't just hilarity and crazy antics, although it could easily get by on those aspects alone. FREE GUY has tons of heart and authenticity despite its virtual reality-based plot, and is about very human emotions such as disillusionment, the feeling of being trapped, and, of course, love. There are times where the heartwarming aspects of this film resemble a charming romantic comedy and others where it gets so existential that it almost feels like The Truman Show. It never dives quite as deep as the latter film, but the fact that it even has the guts to include these themes made this easygoing big-budget movie a far better watch for me. Sure, the last thirty minutes are very cheesy and contain a lot of clichés, but the buildup is so solid that it earns some dumb rom-com moments near the end.FREE GUY is worth going to see because it is one of the few quality films right now that increases one's faith in human nature. Lately I feel as though I have lost my faith in humanity with all that is happening in the world, so it is refreshing to get a movie that feels confident in the human experience. Maybe I'm looking too deep into the message of FREE GUY and maybe it was conceived just so Ryan Reynolds could screw around for two hours, but either way the price of admission is well worth it for an amazing time at the theater.A-",Free Guy
349,imdb-23821,"OK. Silly construction, for Reynolds fans",6,13 August 2021,"I love Ryan Reynolds and enjoyed Deadpool 1 and somewhat Deadpool 2. He has been playing much of the same character lately and this is a good attempt at something original by being derivative of many other ideas. As usual, you can expect some fourth wall breakage and a couple of really good laughs. But overall, the silliness of the concept is unfortunate and is its undoing.Essentially, in the real world, people love playing a video game where the computer characters are don't realize they are computer characters, e.g. The Truman Show. But somehow there is a mixture of a concept of ""AI"" embedded within the game that allows one of its characters to begin to develop his own sense of self being. And that is where it starts to leap off the rails in terms if you have any sense of how computers work and it goes into the gobbledygook world of pure popcorn film fantasy.I found it to be a long watch as the story played out, enjoying the laughs when they presented themselves but it was a very long journey to the end. Perhaps it would be good for younger kids as it is very ""Disneyesque"". To me this was a 6 or maybe 7 on the scale and you might enjoy it so long as you don't expect too much.",Free Guy

Sure it's big, but it's as flaccid. It has no mental penetration power.

357,jaredkjacoby,An NPC with a Heart of Gold,7,15 August 2021,"An NPC in a blue shirt named Guy enjoys his daily routine where he says hi to his goldfish, gets the same coffee every day and works at his job at the bank. He talks about his dream girl and after a bank robbery, he finds her and he decides that the best way to get her attention is get some sunglasses. How does get them? He steals them from the robber the next day and he learns about the mechanics of his video game world: Free City. Meanwhile, the woman of his dreams is actually a player named Millie of the game trying to find coding that her partner's boss stole from them when they created their own game.One thing I will say about Free Guy is that for a Hollywood blockbuster, it is pretty unique. You would think that it would be the standard action/comedy film that we see often, but it actually explores its concept of an NPC with real emotions and how he reacts to it. When he learns about how redundant his life, he realizes he wants to change that. It uses its concept to create an inventive world where the NPCs are harassed by gamers daily. I love how Guy treats the carnage that happens in his world as if it is a daily thing. That feels like something straight out of a game. It also plays with the idea of people looking up to a random guy who does more good than bad in the world and makes the gamers question their morality. That may or may not sit well with others. The movie is incredibly optimistic. There is only one or two scenes that are close to being bleak, but they serve to rebuild the confidence of the main characters. They also make for some funny scenes.Speaking of which, the movie is often clever and witty with its comedy. There a couple of cringeworthy scenes, but there are also some gags that made me laugh hard. There were some cameos that cracked up the audience towards the end. The comedic timing is what makes the humor work. However, there a few times where they go a bit too far with the hamminess and that is when it goes from being funny to being awkward. Overall, the humor is charming and diverse. It helps that the cast is great.Ryan Reynolds is slowly becoming one of my favorite leading actors. Ever since Deadpool, I have enjoyed just about everything he has been in and this movie is no exception. His performance comes off as genuine and sweet. He gives his character a sense of innocence that I truly did not expect. It feels the polar opposite to the crude and raunchy Deadpool. I saw some people say that Rey olds has the same shtick he does in every movie, but I think his performance here proves otherwise. His performance here makes Guy an incredibly likable and endearing protagonist with some surprising hidden depths. Jodie Comer is also a standout. She shares great chemistry with Reynolds and she has the right amount of emotion for her role. Her expression in the scene where her avatar kisses Guy is adorable. Her character in general is also really likable. She seems like the type of woman who would be cold and stoic, but she is actually much more open and dorky than the trailers showed.The other characters are not as memorable as the main leads, but they have their moments. Taika Waititi plays as the villain and I did not take him seriously for a second. This man's plan is to reset his game because Guy is getting a lot of attention and it is threatening his sequel? This man is on the level of Don Cheadle in Space Jam: A New Legacy when it comes to chewing the scenery, except Cheadle's character at least was threatening in that film. Waititi is fun to watch here, but his villainous character is pretty lame all things considered. I think that is why he hammed it up so hard here. Joe Keery as Keys was kind of there. His performance was fine, but I feel like he was outshined by nearly everyone else including his friend at work played by Utkarsh Ambudkar. There is a nice twist with his character at the end though. Lil Rel Howard as Guy's best friend does not play a huge role, but he has a big enough impact by the end. He is really funny and endearing as he usually is. His confusion to everything happening is pretty relatable. Expect a lot of cameos here. You will see a few celebrities and you might see some streamers that you enjoy watching. While the cameos do feel a little gratuitous, I can see why they went hard on them. This is one of the few theatrical movies I have seen that features big name streamers as they react to this random NPC. This is a big thing not just for their fans, but for themselves. When will be the next time they get to share the silver screen in a film with Ryan Reynolds and Taika Waititi? It is a film that represents them in a positive way. The cast of characters is far from perfect, but it is good.Visually, the movie does not stand out, but it is a nice looking film. It is shot and edited well and the special effects are believable enough in the world the characters are in. It is kind of cool to see the glitches in the world. The action scenes however do stand out. They are surprisingly fluid and creative. The first chase scene between Guy and Keys shows the gaming world's potential as well as the montage of Gut leveling up. This is what makes the world of the film work. It makes use out of every possible idea of its concept. The action in the background while Guy goes about his day is also quite funny. There are some nice shots and coloring in the film as well, particularly in the gaming world. The gaming effects are a nice touch when Guy puts the glasses on. I also liked how the game looked on the computers. There are so many details here that are really cool and I may have missed some other Easter eggs. It does not overuse them like Space Jam 2 did. The focus is the story between Guy and Millie. The soundtrack is cheesy but enjoyable. Not quite as good as the last two films I saw, but it gets the job done.Free Guy is a movie that both gamers and non-gamers would equally enjoy. It is a charming story with plenty of laughs, thrills and emotions. This movie explores the perspective of an NPC in a big gaming world in a surprisingly imaginative way. I am still bitter that the last trailer I saw spoiled a big part of the climax for me, but I still had a really good time with this movie. Actually, I did not have a good time. I had a great time!",Free Guy

The villain was a too much sometimes and so on.But all of that does not bother me for longer than a second. The overwhelming portions of the film were pure fun.

360,parrot007,"Funny, unique, and better than expected.",7,4 October 2021,"This movie literally is one of the most unique concepts I've seen in a long time. The absurdity of the question: ""what if an NPC in a video game decided to stop taking player's BS and play the game themselves?"", makes for a pretty enjoyable movie for gamers especially. However, a lot of the writing is watered down probably so that non-gamers are more likely to understand whats going on here.The movie does have another half taking place in the real world with a concept on artificial intelligence. In my opinion while this part does have some more funny moments, it's usually weaker than the parts inside the game.Ryan Reynolds is great in this movie and the side characters are pretty good too. Other than that, the rest of the movie's persoality consists of pop culture references and jokes. The budget really came in handy for that and also it's enormous amount of special effects.This is definitely a movie for mainstream crowds but it's good for a casual daytime movie.",Free Guy

364,willcrabbe,GTA Online meets The Truman Show,7,21 August 2021,"Free Guy is the newest film from director Shawn Levy, who is probably best known for his work on the Night at the Museum series. The film follows Guy (played by Ryan Reynolds) who lives a blissful life in 'Free City', unaware that he is in fact, an NPC in a Grand Theft Auto-like online video game. When he comes across programmer Millie (Jodie Comer) in the game, he begins to become self-aware of his situation and must work together with her and programmer developer Keys (Joe Keery) to save his fellow NPCs from being deleted by the nefarious publisher of the game.Essentially a reimagined Truman Show for the modern age, the film offers some interesting and occasionally though-provoking commentary on what it means to be alive and the nature of consciousness. While it may have not been explored to the same level as a film such as Her (which was a bit of a shame), it provides a bit more depth to something that could have just been a big dumb action adventure picture.I'm not much of a fan of Ryan Reynold's, but he did a good job here. His character felt very much like a semi-homage to Jim Carrey's performance in the aforementioned Truman Show mixed with the charming naivety of Will Ferrell's 'Buddy' in Elf. I also really enjoyed Taika Waititi as the villainous video game publisher 'Antwan' who was deliciously over-the-top and a joy to watch. Unfortunately his character only turns up around halfway through the film as he really breathed some extra life into the proceedings and really helped propel the second half of the film.The humour was very hit and miss but there were some genuinely funny jokes and recurring gags. As the whole thing revolves around video games, there were a large number of references to real-life games and popular gaming Youtubers such as Pokimane and Jacksepticeye. I felt a lot of this was rather cringey and will age the film quite badly in the future, although it will probably appeal to younger audiences.I didn't have high hopes for this one when I saw the trailers, but I've walked away from it pleasantly surprised. It's a fun and explosive action comedy that also dips into some more interesting themes that'll give you some food for thought. Maybe you'll think twice before mercilessly mowing down pedestrians on Grand Theft Auto in the future.",Free Guy

Witty, visually mesmerizing, and with a load of cultural references, Free Guy feels like a fun mix of Ready Player One, The Truman Show, and Deadpool.Prepare for a wild ride anchored by Reynolds' typical charm. Sure the overall plot is relatively single-sided and the love story is a bit stressed, but the entertainment value is through the roof. Watch this movie. You will not be disappointed.Also, there are multiple Easter eggs and funny references that gamers should be able to pick up on, making the film even more enjoyable for anybody with video game experience.",Free Guy
375,Safetylight,That was fun. Silly fun. Nice to see Steve Harrington and a Robin clone finally together.,6,19 August 2021,"You already know the general concept.Like Ready Player One but less post-apocalyptic.The Villain was kinda dumb; if you realized that you had the first living AI in your system, the last thing you'd do is try to kill it off because it was getting in the way of making video game sales. You could trade up for actual power in the world. But whatever...The casting director played nicely off the Stranger Things characters, though I would have liked to have seen the actual Maya Hawke playing against Joe Keery. I guess she wasn't available or didn't have the right connections or something. (She's certainly attractive enough.)It was fun to see the licensing department spring for a few expensive seconds of Star Wars and Marvel Universe IP. (That stuff broke the bank on Ready Player One.)There were a few irritating nods to Woke ideological garbage, but not so much that you couldn't ignore it. It didn't exceed a 1990's level, (but everybody is so raw-nerved about that stuff now that it nonetheless causes some brief winces).Fun and forgettable, made for all ages.You won't feel like you've wasted your time, but it's still mostly empty calories.

The storyline is so well done and very engaging - great characters who you really care about. They make you laugh and smile, with some romance thrown in along the way! All the performances were brilliantly done and the comedy was just so well timed and actually very funny.",Free Guy
379,ChrisInMiami,Fun despite its weaknesses,7,15 August 2021,"PREMISE - Guy is an artificial character in a video game, Free City, stuck in the same loop, with the same dialogue, interacting with the same artificial characters while he works in a bank, which gets robbed over and over again by the actual gamers. He inexplicably develops a yearning to do and be more.ANALYSIS
It's Truman Show meets Ready Player One(which shares its screenwriter with Free Guy) and Reynolds portrayal of Guy as a romantic dreamer carries the story above its simplistic narrative. Its got a great supporting cast with Jodie Comer (if you've seen her performance as Vilanelle in Killing Eve it looks like she's using 1/10th of her talent), Joe Keery (Steve from Stranger Things in a bit of curious casting that works) and Lil Rel Howery as Guy's ever faithful best friend. It's full of plenty of forced plot points like characters suddenly showing up where they are needed despite being nowhere near just moments ago but things like that don't matter in Free Guy (or Free City); it doesn't take itself seriously instead just focusing on its fun premise and the well oiled theme of character aspirations.Proof a movie doesn't have to dot all the i's to entertain.",Free Guy

+ Ryan Reynolds brings the wacky energy of Jim Carrey, but in a way that's not cringey in the 2020s
+ Great premise
+ Good supporting cast
+ Great SFX, avoided being too CGI heavy (unlike Ready Player One)Cons
Taika Waititi is awful, aggressively unfunny (and I'm an In the Shadows fan)The YouTuber commentary pulls you out of the film, should've been cutWould've been better as a 15, the games this references are famously violent so it's noticeably lacking in blood/swearingA few script howlers ""coding is just 1s and 0s"" (no it isn't) etc.",Free Guy
386,afrocut,FUN GUY,8,16 August 2021,"What a surprise this movie turned out to be. I went in expecting Ryan Reynolds usual Deadpool over board comedy styling smashed into a Grand Theft Auto spoof. While it definitely has some of that, it's also a fun comedy, romantic, action film. Reynolds is perfect here at playing, well, himself. He is Guy, a happy, niave, and totally loveable NPC (non playable character) who lives inside the video game Free City. One day he sees the woman of his dreams, an outside players avatar, and falls down a path of self awareness that's always been there. This leads to some great video game exploration and funny set pieces as the outside world starts taking notice. It's like one part ""Truman Show"" and one part ""ready player one"" . In fact it actually accomplishes all the things the latter film failed at. The romance is not forced or creepy, it's actually quite endearing. Even The references are subtle and rewarding when shown. Sure, the science, tech troupes and hacking dialogue all can be laughable at times as well as headscratching, but that's to be expected in a film like this. Some of characters on the outside can be its worst moments, feeling faker than the actual game characters at times. Taika Waititi, here playing the villain, in particular comes off extremely over the top but still kind of funny. Some of the references, like flossing, will be instantly cringy to younger audiences who have short patience with things they found funny 20 minutes ago. But the movie really can't be blamed for this, sine after all it was pushed back well over a year from covid. I really enjoyed this film and it's nice to be pleasantly surprised from time to time.",Free Guy

I love the CGI the comedy of course, and the plot of the story. At first I thought this movie would be like ready player one but it's different. The Free City or the game in this film was super detail to tell us that what the game looks likes, the concept too and I really like the ending visual it's look like a heaven I don't know, but I feel like it's a heaven.This movie not like the best or the masterpiece movie it just good fun to watch, I love the actor and the acting, and I really love Ryan in this movie. The ending when guy hand turn into a hulk hand and bring the Captain America shield that was super cool. It's kinda weird fell in love with a game character, and when guy kiss Millie, Millie was act like she get real kiss from guy and that was so weird but it's funny to. Guy is like a letter from keys, that he made that character based on him self, that he love Millie and that was really explained why he really love Millie, at first I thought Millie was his sister, and I was kinda disappointed why Millie and Keys kiss get cut like they almost kissing.I've heard that free guy will be have a sequel and if that real, I really want to watch the sequel, but I think this movie is not really need a sequel.",Free Guy

400,phobicsq,Fun Yet Predictable,5,29 September 2021,"The premise the film is very interesting as it's a film focusing on a character played by Reynolds who is a NPC player in a video game world as well as real people trying to find evidence that their game code was stole to make the game which Reynolds NPC character inhabits called Free City. The bad guy in the film is a untalented hack who stole his previous companions idea/code to make his hit game which reminds me of so many people in the real world to some degree who are considered wealthy and successful.The time spent with Reynolds NPC character ""blue shirt guy"" is mostly entertaining but once the romance starts it becomes less interesting especially how they try and toss in the two creators of the game's code romantic relationship near the end. The finale of the film is a chaotic mess of CGI and odd imagining of how games work which shows the lack of knowledge the writes of the film have.Bottom line, the film is funny at times, has some interesting ideas, and decent scenery.",Free Guy

Taika Waititi is a surprisingly good at playing villain), great visuals (both in-game and on-screen), and lots of gags and references.I first was a little frustrated with a scarcity of the videogame user behaviour references, but then it was brought to my attention that not everyone is familiar with it, which made the amount make sense as it was still there for those who would notice, but not too much to distract others (it's still all there, in all its awkwardness and idiocy, but you need to watch the background scenes closely).Overall it's a solid fun with a lot of work to make it modern, futuristic and believable all at the same time, and apart from a dash of a questionable acting it was a great fun.",Free Guy

He wasn't fun bad or threatening, he was just so unbelievably annoying I hated any screen time he had. I didn't want to see him lose, I just didn't want to see him (I don't think this was an issue with the actor, just the writing).Overall it was pretty good and I especially liked that there was a compelling goal that had stakes.

422,Fiercesome_Fool,Typical Hollywood,4,25 September 2021,I should have known better than to think this movie would be anything more than it was. This movie is such a by the numbers Hollywood movie that it feels like a committee wrote it.The movie has the usual unrealistic romantic subplot junk thrown in. It has the token character best friend that is played by discount Kevin Hart. There was about four times I got a chuckle in the simplistic humor in this movie.The real issue is that the plot of the movie is filled with holes. Anyone with a sliver of programming knowledge will not be able to get through the last third of this movie without shaking their heads. The antagonist easily could have won but nope. We all know that Hollywood is clueless in regards to other fields and this movie shows.Just a predictable and lame movie funnily enough made for NPCs.,Free Guy

Taika Waitti on the other hand, was a bit disappointing, and that comes from a big fan of his. Something he applied on his character didn't work well.

Unlike a film like 'Wreck-It-Ralph' where the character simply exists as a living being within the game world, Guy is actually a complex AI that achieves sentience... and unique game dialogue... and new game animations. Programmers are often seen manipulating the world to navigate through it rather than using a teleport or no-clip feature to navigate through the world more efficiently. The main programmer kid even mentions coding in binary at one point. NO GAME DEVELOPER IS CODING IN BINARY!Ryan Reynolds is fun to watch, but his performance is a near carbon copy of how he plays Deadpool. He does manage to carry the film effectively enough to get to the finale which is just a series of references that only exist because Disney acquired Fox and they wanted to take advantage of the access to new IPs. The film's biggest problem is being unfortunately boring when it's not absolutely aggravating. At least we got to see Jacksepticeye on the big screen.",Free Guy

431,ryan-44110,Probably one of the worst movies all year,2,25 September 2021,"Love Reynolds and Waititi but this movie was awful. The 9's and 10's seem out of place or overly generous as the movie is void of plot or purpose aside from showing a hidden romance for a girl through an in-game character AI. The AI carries the whole movie till about the end and suddenly he truly doesn't matter anymore. I was fully ready to go into this with hard Ready Player 1 vibes, but that was far from what we got. It's like a boomer-take on zoomer lifestyle... a movie meant to appeal to kids who like fortnite and all their wacky crossovers and gimmicks. The CGI used looked massively dated even when simulating a video game, and the protags literally shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly.",Free Guy
432,loozzotys,overrated bad CGI silly logic,2,8 October 2021,If you had no computer knowledge or of coding then its OK I guess but this is just silly ridiculousness and their concepts are ludicrous and illogical. The CGI is childish. Totally overrated boring predictable movie.,Free Guy

I'm not sure what all of the high ratings are about, as this movie was completely mediocre at best.It's an unoriginal concept and plot, taken from the likes of Ready Player One and Wreck it Ralph. There were some fun parts, but overall it was a bit of a letdown and the humour felt forced.It's worth a watch, but I wouldn't pay for it. Don't believe the 9 and 10's on here.

I mean it was really good. Me and my wife saw it in 3D and it was full of action, heart, and comedy. I mean the supporting cast was amazing too! The whole thing just worked together.

It is crazy and fun (the way every Ryan Reynolds' movie should be)!In optical terms is an immersing reality that makes a comparison between Artificial Intelligence and the ludocracy of the Gaming world (making a clear decision to carve against GTA and other free will games). We can really see this type of behavior, as the movie switches at the beginning to show the real world.As so, Ryan Reynolds with perfect timing jokes and his charming performance makes this movie more than it is supposed to be! The plot and motives within the characters is really obvious and predictable, however the movie transcends by using simple gadgets to relate with our daily lives.However, the movie lacks a bit of surprising elements or even a more complex concept of what the gaming industry it is like and the properties of A. I.; Still comprensible considering the screen time and the film's approach.Additionally, some references are just as good as the movie itself, with the intention of conveying more attention and creativity to the screenplay.Overall, it is pretty funny and ""teenagish""; don't expect much more of that... but it still has an mature appeal inside its main idea. Sincerely, is a really good popcorn movie!Ps: Taika kind of dissapoints on the delivery of some kind of antagonistic character, that has no apparent motives or common reason.",Free Guy

Ryan Reynolds is...well, Ryan Reyolds, basically. If you've seen him in more or less any movie he's made (with the possible exception of Green Lantern) you know what you're gonna get. The likeable wisecracking is in full effect. Jodie Comer, however, is a revelation. I must admit to never having been a fan of her work but she more than holds her own in the likeability stakes.A fantastic supporting cast which includes a pantomime baddy in Taika Waititi and a superb cameo from Chaning Tatum add to the enjoyment immensely. Much has been made of the special effects, which are top notch, but the most notable thing sbout Free Guy is its soft centre. This is a very sweet movie and all the better for it. Please, Hollywood, no Free Guy 2. Leave us this gem to enjoy for the ages...",Free Guy
461,TruthSeeker82,Kind of stupid,3,5 October 2021,"This movie dosen't make much sense if you know how the computer code works. Plus as usual they added some stupid dialogues for no reason.

I couldn't care less what happened to any of the characters or ""characters"". A TRULY average film, that will probably make tons of cash. Hollywood takes zero risk these days, and it's sad.

469,stani_cv,It's like skiing down Mt Everest,6,9 October 2021,"The movie starts well with sort of an interesting concept, even if seen in other movies already. Ryan Reynolds is a good actor that presents a likeable average ""guy"" who happens to be an NPC in a shooter game. I've played a bunch of video games, but who knew that NPCs have daily routines written by the programmers. They actually live somewhere with a pet fish. So during the time they walk from their house to whatever their job is, players can't do missions or what??? That's the kind of childish logic that leads the movie completely downhill. The protagonist and supports are doing a decent act, but the main antagonist is a complete idiot. How did someone like him manage to run a game company without the basic knowledge of computers? I mean the guy tried to axe the servers instead of pulling the plugs near the end. You'll say that it's a videogame movie, so it can't be too realisitc, but everything in it defies the most basic logic of software development. The original Tron makes more sense than this movie and it was written almost 40 years ago. So story aside and all the plotholes, the movie is further ruined by a bunch of youtube personas whom I've never heard of nor do I care to know. I did not need their opinion on guy to like or dislike him. Additionally, for a gamers' movie, it's somehow weird that all the male characters seemed like jerks or idiots while the good and ethical real player happens to be a female. I can go on and on since it's a trend throughout the whole film, but it's the kind of product you get when it passes through disney filters. At the end of the day it's mindless fun like pixels, but even that one stayed away from unnecessary messaging. In my book they're both equally fun/bad so I'll leave it at that.",Free Guy
470,Rageypoo,"One part strong, one part weak story.",6,29 August 2021,"The movie has basically 2 different story lines going on at once, and it will do whatever it can to try and convince you that they are related, and it is really hard to believe it. There are 2 different worlds, the ""real world"" and the cyber world that is inside of a big super company (of course) controlled by a tyrant owner (of course) anyways, the cyber story is actually extremely well written and enjoyable to watch, Ryan does a fantastic job of doing well..y'know Ryan stuff, and then to make tension and drama in the movie there has to be the outside real world stuff that really just gets in the way of the film. You don't really believe that the world was made by these 2 kids, you can barely believe that they worked for the big bad company that stole their code, and you can barely believe that the CEO is this obviously incompetent moronic caricature it's just 100% not believable. The acting is horrific and really takes away from the charm and fun of the cyber world. I found the real world drama and dialog to be a sloppy plot device that brought the overall movie down, but I would still recommend the watch, it was a lot of fun.The use of youtubers and ""influencers"" was also extremely cringeworthy, and in my opinion, completely unecessary. They could have used unknown actors and accomplished the same end, I think they tried giving it more weight by using these people but it comes off as disingenuous and pretentous at times, and in a way exposing them for who they really are, actors. I don't think using them was a good move and again just detracts from the savory goodness this film has. The use of 4th wall breaking between the cyber/real world I thought was well done with Channing Tatum, I would have liked to see him do even more of the signature video game moves, just because it would be nice to see a skilled human do it.The plot twist was also a little poorly done, I saw the twist coming early in the film when Ryan was opening and closing the shades, something no other NPC did so I knew it would come back later, but what didn't make sense was the ""trigger"" that was in the game. Before it was the song she was singing that made Ryan say ""that's a great song"" instead of his normal NPC catch phrase, so when the system was rebooted, I thought for sure she needed to sing that song again, instead of just kissing him. I felt that was a little sloppy.Overall I'd highly recommend seeing the movie if you don't mind some very cringe moments, there are some funny moments as well and an overall great story telling with Ryan. The real world part is just poorly done and unrealistic to be enjoyable.",Free Guy

476,onze-kris,Stream personality award goes to...,1,15 October 2021,"I went to see this movie since it got rave reviews. After watching it I understand it , but not because it is good but it features a bunch of streamers.It pains me that they used a common misconception of a twenty something yelling at his mom during playing a game.It could have been a homage to video games and the players that play it except that the message is go out into the real world to find your love.SO I am really unsure if the streamers get that it is ridiculing their live. And the fans of said streamers as well. I sort of suspect that those fans of said streamers are responsible for the high rating. Than again all the marvel movies are getting high scores as well and they are pretty bad too.OK . That aside the story is predictable from the moment the woman lead shows herself and that is a bit let down as well. And the depiction of how to be a player is a joke as well. A pretty bad one.I really have nothing to say. Well you are better of playing video games instead of watching this. And video games have replayvalue this absolutely has none.Oh about the title of my review. Word got out how much switchstreamers make. Really good for them and I also found out that a female streamer capped how much she could receive from her fans. Really good of her. Sort of mixed feelings. The movie recognizes her influence on the community. Sort of sad she isn't aware that the movie is taking a dump on it.OH and I get the humor. Hard to not understand that level.",Free Guy
477,Sobertoaster-764-479561,"Had the budget and Ryan Reynolds, that's about it.",3,3 October 2021,"Really painfully boring to watch after the first 20 or so minutes. Like other reviewers have said it's pretty much just insulting to gamers and gamer culture, typical ""hello fellow teens"". With what I would assume overpriced cameos from streamers such as Ninja and maybe others? I don't know... I don't follow streamers.The ""viral reaction"" type stuff from people about blue shirt guy was so cringey. The story is terrible, he's an AI and his world might be shut down for the next game, oh no. He is also the AI that some tech geeks invented that the code was stolen from them or something from the big game company, so there's that, oh it's also a love story... yea the one geek likes the other one, who first likes the AI, then realizes the AI was designed to fall in love a girl like his geeky partner. He literally tells her this at one point, and she doesn't get it apparently. Then there is some lame moment at the end where it replays that dialog where he is legit spelling it out for her, like it can't be more clear, and she has this realization ""oh the guy has been in front of me the whole time!"" typical cliche Hollywood stuff.Overall it fails to take any sort of risk whatsoever and was formulaically designed for the lowest common denominator.The action aspect was too goofy and safe, a couple scenes were OK chorography wise but the grand majority of the action was just meh boring, like move the plot forward in typical Hollywood fashion because it's an afterthought. It really needed that R rating and more mature themes in my opinion especially for a GTA style game.The comedy aspect was also pretty bad IMO, didn't laugh once. It's the type of movie that the writers/producers thought ""black guy talking in a high pitched goofy voice=funny"" because again, this panders to children.Ryan Reynolds is typical charming funny Ryan Reynolds but even he couldn't do much with the script he was given. I would pause this at points and go ""wow I can't believe this is only half over"", The movie dragged.",Free Guy

488,redn_path01,Good for kids,4,24 September 2021,"Not so good for adults.While the movie doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste, thanks to its flat and entirely predictable plot, it misses out on a lot of fantastic opportunities to play with the implications of self-aware NPCs and simulated realities in general.But yeah if you need to occupy your offspring for 2 hours, this will probably get the job done. ;) If you are hoping for an interesting take on AI and whatnots, look elsewhere.",Free Guy

It is a film that symbolizes the lives of our people, who are divided into classes, and the rich are the first class and the working class without glasses, who are accustomed to living like this and living like a car. They do not know that they are a car, they have nothing to do, they have a choice and a protest. Say no. They do not know that every few years one of them goes to university and his family life improves. Otherwise, only the affluent class has only glasses that have everything and everyone works for their own interests and everyone works to protect only their whole body from being harmed. Whether it is money or power, they do everything, even if it means cutting off the lives of the rest of the weak class, like closing them, do not move from where they are, do not move the game. To achieve the desires !!! This is not human inequality, who are those who put themselves in the place of human beings and play as ordinary human beings in our daily lives?",Free Guy
490,frankperkins-76225,"Great movie, but scary deep down",9,14 August 2021,"Free Guy is a fun movie, with Ryan Reynolds as the lead giving his stereotypical, witty humor. However, deep down this is a dark, scary movie that makes the viewer question their place in the universe and whether forces control our destiny.Although this movie is seen as a comedy with great special effects and nail biting action, this viewer and his friends thought it to be scary, sad, and oftentimes depressing.I am not saying that this movie is not a must see yet quite the contrary. It is a great movie, but it allows for open dialogue if you take your children to it. This dialogue could include alternate universes, and whether our life has meaning and a purpose. This is hands down the best movie of the summer. If you like to meet for coffee with friends after movies and have discussions, this is a movie for you to see.",Free Guy

The acting was superb. Jodie Comer was stunningly beautiful and a brilliant actress. The story itself was very cleverly written. Special effects was outstanding.

I thought that i will see another action pack but Free Guy is wayyyyyyyyyy more.The cgi effects are amazing. You can think that you are immersing in to the game as you watch this movie. The action sequences are incredible. The direction, the photography... Hell everything is awesome.Also we finally get to see a movie where the AI created does not have psychopathix tendencies against mankind. Only another tv series did that.Taika's performance wasn't as good but i enjoyed Jodie far more than i could imagine. Also Lil Rel was phenomenal.Ryan is Ryan. I spotted some of his personal touches in the movie. And i want to pose a question. Ryan????? Are you auditioning for a jedi role? Cause you rocked the mixed second and third form of lightsaber fighting. Also some little nuggets here and there...Now seriously! When the movie finished i was hoping for a post credit scene. Perhaps a tease. Didn't get it but here's hoping.The movie slides brilliantly with an excellent pace between gags, comedy, action and some drama. I had so much fun. It was a long time since i enjoyed a film in theatre. I need to go way back...You must see it! You must vote FOR it! We must get a sequel!",Free Guy

499,malakia2966,A fun and funny movie.,9,24 September 2021,"Watched this tonight with Wife, our 12yr old & 10yr old. A couple of swear words here-or-there, sadly no worse then they hear in the school yard.As Parents we are generally tuned-into Social/Political commentary in most modern Hollywood productions, but even with a keen-eye, there were only 1 or 2 instances (i.e. Gun violence); though it was handled with humor.On to the movie...
Being parents under 50, with two kids 12 (and under) it was a GREAT watch together.As others mentioned they Cast ""Real"" Video game streamers who were immediately recognized by the 12/10 yr olds, this enhanced their ability to connect with the movie, and even though we didn't recognize them, we did understand the point of the character.The ""Easter Egg"" points were relevant, made ALL of us laugh and helped to Unite us in our enjoyment.The somewhat 'schmultzy' ending finished off the experience PERFECTLY. They wrapped up all the major plot lines, made us all feel happy, smiling and fulfilled. It ended the way your Heart wants it to.The critiques, we feel, we actual strengths. The similarity to the Truman show allowed Mom and I to relate, the 'life lessons' were obvious and picked-up by all of us, the humor was both young-enough (at times) and adult-enough throughout that none of us felt bored.For our Family, we laughed together, we clapped together and in the end, we all ahh'ed together.Give it a shot, hopefully it strikes the same chords as it did for us.",Free Guy

Yeah, I saw some other reviewers talk about ""identity"" politics being involved (not the case) or there was poor writing (again just not the case). This was a film that had a proper purpose. Almost a throw back to when film were just simply silly and fun. Not trying to prove anything any not difficult to follow.

501,DarioTheSweeper,Interesting topic.,10,8 November 2021,"This movie was offered to me on Disney+. First I had to think about it, but then I decided to see this. And I have to say what I saw wasn't bad.Ryan Reynolds plays the main character named Guy. If you are going to win this actor for a project it must be a good idea for a movie. This movie builds on what one fears for the future, what there can be on earth and maybe already is. I don't want to reveal more, but the movie has similarities with the game GTA and the movie Ready Player One. The creators have succeeded very well in bringing everything that is important into this movie. You can even add that space has even been found for love, which, by the way, I liked a lot. A lot of action and a lot of humor are part of this movie.That was an excellent pastime. Highest score because I appreciate this work very much and I am extremely satisfied.",Free Guy

516,bass-player-blues,Insulting incoherent mess,1,18 August 2021,"This movie displays everything I hate about modern Hollywood... From the moment it begins absolutely everything you see or hear on screen is 100% determined by focus groups trying to please everyone paint by numbers style versus actual artistic ingenuity or originality. There's zero attempt to establish any sort of backstory for the characters, instead just shove a bunch of loud CGI down your throat right off the bat and familiar popular music as a cheap way to win over the general audience. Nothing surprises you at all. They got Reynold's copying Jim Carey's blissful cheerfulness from The Truman Show, the actor who plays his best friend just copies Kevin Hart verbatim because ""Everyone likes Kevin Hart and he's in all the movies!"" Even the main actress' performance sounds exactly like Ellen Page (now Elliot Page) from Inception. The video game world they created doesn't feel fun and surreal like it should, just seems like real life with a bunch of glowing ""power-up"" items and the occasional tank lurking about ala GTA. It can be pretty at times but mostly comes across hollow and heartless.I have nothing against a good popcorn guilty pleasure flick but this sort of movie is the worst of both worlds; dumbed down plastic garbage with the appalling audacity to pass itself off as something ground-breaking . It does this with zero continuity as well. After 15 straight minutes of mind numbing CGI action scenes they have the audacity to preach some flat side plot about business integrity and innovation. On top of that way too much of the run time is dedicated to a generic rom-com style side plot which feels forced and distracts from the main premise which was completely non-existent to begin with.",Free Guy

We sat down with a pizza, glass of wine on a Friday night just so we could watch something that we didn't need to think about too much that could just wash over us.Free Guy was really enjoyable. Part Truman Show, part Wreck it Ralph, but none the worse for it. Ryan Reynolds is just fun to watch. Simple as that.

There is little development in other characters, got boring. Having cameo's in your movie doesn't make it good.

But then no other actor is given much material to work with. The romantic element is handled so badly by Jodie Comer's Millie/Molotovgirl that there is no chemistry between either Guy in the game or Keys (Joe Kerry) in the real world!With a sprinkling of other poorly acted side characters and a bad guy that belongs in a pantomime, there is not much here.

And if Molly did drop the legal action after getting the rights to their original game back, if the suit wasn't about the money but just getting to release why not give it a free release online? Surely they still have copies from before they sold out. If the publisher is hiding the engine they built on they can't initiate their own legal action.

I read somewhere he improvised his parts, if that's the case he needs to stick to the scripts in future because it was terrible.Overall this is your typical run of the mill comedy movie plot with gross amounts of pop culture references jammed into it so it appeals to everybody. It has some funny moments but they are quickly forgotten by the countless horrible and cringe worthy ones like the cameos from ""youtubers"" or antwan.boss guy, It's clearly just a very quick cash grab film as its already dated and it's only just come out.I'm really not sure who they are trying to appeal this movie to as it takes a shot everyone. But it seems like they mostly take the mick out of its target audience. The gamers . This movie is really only appealing to them but they get made out to be little girls behind the screens and called man boys who live in their moms basements who use a w@@k sock and are constantly insulted all the way through the film.Talk about biting the hand that feeds youThen there's this off brand message that you shouldn't go round killing NPC's and the ""youtubers"" and random video clips of people backing it up. Im guessing thats the writers taking a swipe at gta v due to the violence in the game and this is them trying to get a point across ...
just like in the parts of the film they are trying to send a message by stating the white male character suffers from his ""white male privilege"" and all the players have a ""toxic male masculinity"" mindset ..... why bring your political views or negative views on white men into a film that's supposed to be a comedy for everybody ? Once again i had to sit there and listen to the ramblings of some woke writer ruin the film within the first 15 mins and try to make me feel guilty about my race and sex because they couldn't help but keep their toxic ideas to themselves.I watch films (especially comedy films ) to escape from the real world and politics or to just brighten my day. Now all i ever hear on films is race baiting catchphrases and shots at white men and how evil they are... Why is this a thing? It's not funny or inspiring or helping a cause ,It's just sickening.I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody tbh . No teenager will think its funny, just cringy and no person whos not into gaming will find it mildly interesting because the plot is trash. The only people that will enjoy this is ryan reynolds fans who enjoy his quirky sense of humor or little kids who will block out any of the story/plot and just watch it for the visuals and gaming references,..... ""look mom ,fortnight"".It could have been a good and funny film if done right but it fails hard. If they had dialed back the wokeness made an effort to relate to the gamers instead of insulting them and made the boss anything but an over the top 80s villain that you would find in one of the the 3 ninja kids movies then you would have been on the right track.I give this a 2/10. And that's being generous.",Free Guy

I really cannot see how anyone over 10 years old and watched more than 10 movies can stand the many many cringe-worthy moments.It had a great premise, even though it's far from original (many novels explored this concept already).

Since I'm not a gamer, there were a few instances that I kinda felt lost. The 2 hour movie was a bit lengthy but a chunk of it was funny and entertaining.

569,Patric7,A great summer movie.,9,20 August 2021,"Hated the beginning because I hate movies that are narrated. Think ""Blade Runner"" when first released. Would ""The Matrix"" have been as good if Neo had narrated it. The only thing I hate worse than narration in non-documentaries is movie trailers that tell you the whole movie. Think ""Castaway"". Fortunately the narration ends after a few minutes. And yes narration is why I only gave it 9 stars. Had there been no narration it would have left people in suspense as to what was going on, like a Hitchcock movie, and made for a better movie. Like ""The Matrix"" only with slapstick.So my advice, go see this movie in 3D, don't wait for Netflix (I hate streaming). It is a hoot, you'll get more than a few belly laughs and the CGI is first class.Oh, and Taiki Waititi Is worth the price of admin..",Free Guy

He is playing the same character as in Deadpool, Hitman 1 & 2 and Pokemon. There were still parts that I found funny but it was more because of the physical comedy than any set up and delivery by Reynolds. I found the real world plot more interesting if less entertaining. Taika Waititi was fun as Antoine. So much so that I almost forgot how he turned Thor into a joke. Would have been a better movie if they knocked 15-20 minutes off of the runtime.

A bit vanilla and light at first, almost feels like a teen sci-fi movie, but then shapes up very well at the end, with well judged plot developments, and a really well put together finale. Works very well as a bit of solid filmmaking entertainment!While I wouldn't say that it's groundbreaking in any respect really (although the script is really very clever, and Reynolds plays his role almost to perfection, or rather the role suits him to perfection), the experience overall is powerful, and it does suspend your disbelief for a couple of very entertaining hours.And best of all, the effects don't overwhelm the movie one bit, which is perhaps one of its best features - it's very focused on the main characters, and their struggles, and doesn't ever let effects get in the way of that. Again, very well judged!",Free Guy

There was a nice appearance of First Avenger himself, Star Wars and some hilarious pop culture references throughout the course of Free Guy.But to me some elements were just annoying and not so funny towards the end, some mildly laughable moments, some good Visual effects, becoming a little boring kind of drag and RYAN RENOLDS HUMOR didn't do it for me.I hated the formulated unoriginal Hollywood approach and ended up un-original overhyped disappointment..!!",Free Guy

The special effects are great, the performance also for the most part. I didn't like so much Taika Waititi, I think he was overdoing it, but Ryan and Jodie were simply amazing. The story and the dialogues are beautifully written and the jokes are hilarious. As a whole, the movie surprised me in the most positive way and left me feeling very optimistc.

I guess the overwhelming hype must come from a teen or YA audience.It's fun and light, with plenty of goodhearted vibes and cartoon action. There's some very loose Truman Show or Westworld themes, but they're just played for laughs - there's specifically no substance here, only style.Similarly to Ready Player One, you'll see plenty of pop culture references from film, YouTube land, TV shows etc - and there's two fun little cameos - but apart from going ""wasn't that from....?"" they don't really add anythingI'm getting a little tired of the zany Ryan Reynolds shtick, and there's plenty of that here. If you're still into that, then maybe you'll enjoy watching him do his thing. Jodie Comer brings the film its only real edge, with a two sided performance (super cool hero / nerdy coder) that's very watchable.My advice: wait until it's free on streaming and enjoy it when you've got nothing better to do. Don't spend money getting it now, like I did.",Free Guy

But now he's in video game, with a 2-hour runtime about becoming a wacky but rogue AI?That's an idea that's sounds like it would get tiresome by the end of the first 10 minutes, forget 120.Where this could have been a bloated rip-off or a decent-but-forgettable 90 minute money-grab most studious would have churned out, I was shocked to find genuinely impressive action, great comedy and surprisingly thoughtful themes to boot. This is a phenomenal film.Reynolds is ""Guy"", an NPC character in the video game ""Free City"", a game world made from someone who likely thought Grand Theft Auto was too peaceful to its inhabitants.One day strolling down the side-walk as programmed, Guy meets the girl of his dreams, a real player who is confused at the seemingly impossible AI come to life.Surely it must be a hacker of some sort, right? Wrong, and the story goes from there.More and more people notice Guy, and some he goes viral across the internet, this is where the movie becomes something more. Most people notice his key characteristic is... not being a dick to anyone, or even rude.Why, they ask? Who would be kind in a game of all places?! But Guy doesn't care. Yes, he is doing this to get close to the love of his life. But it's how he's going about this that matters.How sad is that? It says a lot of the 2021 mindset that the core tenants of a screen hero are no longer extraordinary bravery, or impossible amounts of courage (though Guy has both), but genuine encouragement for one's peers. To be just a friendly, caring voice.Sure, I could go on about the great cameos, or that this is easily the most beautiful film of the year along with The Green Knight.I also don't have to mention the fist fights as some of the cleanest and most exciting since the original Matrix film.This movie is great for the fact that Guy is really the kind of hero, onscreen or off, you wish we had more of these days, and one that leaves you feeling inspired in real wonder.",Free Guy
606,joepoohcake,Thinks it's more than it is,3,2 October 2021,"It's really kinda trash. Not funny. Wasted talent. Mocks it's target audience. Boring story and the worst performance by Taika Waititi I've seen yet. I'd pass. Also, the dude at the end... Really... This again. Not impressed.",Free Guy
607,dizzymediainc,Incredibly well done!,10,26 September 2021,"Free Guy is one of those movies you can tell they put an incredible amount of thought and love into, it's definitely not just another rake in the cash on video games film!Ryan Reynolds does an awesome job as Guy, really portraying a character who has literally spent their entire life in a constant loop, yet breaks out of it and starts gaining new experiences one moment at a time.As Guy experiences new things and grows, Ryan carefully tunes his performance to each moment, giving Guy the perfect characteristics of a child curious about everything and loving every moment.The plot itself is incredibly detailed, from the layout, design, screen displays and even the in game reflections (which is actually a thing in a lot of games and has been used in the past to display in game easter eggs, etc.), the amount of game developer detail that was included in this movie is really astonishing. As a game developer myself, it's easy to appreciate what they went through to make it very accurate.While some ""gamers"" might complain that the portrayal of streamers was not accurate, the reality is that they were very accurate and it just goes to show the dumb stuff streamers do to get views and how they themselves won't ever cop to the reality of what they are doing.From a great cast, well thought out plot and non stop laughs, Free Guy is now #1 on my list of awesome video game movies!",Free Guy

It felt very unnatural. There are more lines and moments like this.HOWEVER. That is all the negative criticism I have to give.It's an action/romcom/existential dilemma movie is all I can call it. What I love are the references and the fa t that they got actual gaming youtubers like Poki Jack Septiceye + a few others to be a part of the movie.If you're a Gamer, or if you love gaming, plus want a feel-good love story + comedy movie there's a good chance you'll eat this one up.Also, Chris Evans cameo = best cameo.",Free Guy

But, the reality is, those appearances were a necessary distraction.Hollywood is clearly out of original ideas. This movie is nothing more than another mash-up of previous movies. Many of the movies have already been mentioned in other comment posts here on imdb, at least most of those movies were original ideas. Ready Player One, The Truman Show, The Matrix, etc. Etc. Sad to see Hollywood's current so called ""writing talent"" is lost, and out of original ideas. My guess is Ryan Reynolds knows that to be true, and why he purchased a small cell phone company as an exit strategy, a way for added income.I am a positive thinker, but, I am also a realist. When you see Hollywood resorting to producing nothing original anymore, that is a clear sign creativity in this generation lacking.We are now seeing nothing but re-hashing of old movies, and mashups of previous original flicks from big budget companies. That is not a good sign.",Free Guy

It had a great premise and great writing. It's one of the best video game based movies ever. I really love everything about this movie. There's nothing I can find wrong with it. Taiki waititi is hilarious. There are so many Easter eggs and little references to Ryan Reynolds past movies and the MCU. I really enjoyed this movie I highly recommend this. Go and see it.

The storyline was slow to get going and ended up being something quite generic.The use of streamers, ""influencer"" YouTubers and real world news/celebrity people to talk about the game made it cringy and seemed to show its self awareness that it was a blockbusting un unique money grab film that won't be remembered in a hurry.",Free Guy

620,Booglu,"A soft, visually great and solid movie!",9,5 September 2021,"I want to admit I liked the first half of the movie much better.The build up was so great, leaving full of possibilities and leaving us anxious to see what comes next. However, for me there had been a slight disappointment on how things continued close to the end.Nevertheless, there were some goosebumping moments such as the second kiss where Guy becomes aware again after being rebooted, his fight with character Dude, and some more.Seeing some elements from my favorite movie Matrix, and from Truman Show, sometimes feeling that they are delibaretly put, elevates the pace and anticipation level for the audience.I didnt find this movie particularly funny but found the idea of an AI such as this pretty delightful, the love element for awakening sort of smart, and the non-exxagerated ending on spot.Also, it was fun to see Joe Keery as Keys from Stranger Things.I went to this movie because of reviews and the results were beyond my expectations. But, it really seemed the second half could have been much more impactful. I guess that is because AI idea is a fascinating one, and Ryan Reynolds and the setting fit to it so well.",Free Guy

To be honest, Jody Comer's talents were wasted on this film, though you could see she was having fun, and who can blame her?

Constant mind provocation, with theories that make you improve your neurons usage. A science film, that offers top of the game emotions. If Humanity needs proof of mind evolution, this film is one of them, you can perceive many societies coming together to create emotions to the extreme. And the generosity cannot go unnoticed. The choice of abandoning the usual distribution of protagonism, for contrasting emotions, is a new kind of movies.

Even tho I had a great time, I couldn't help but admire the layers of this exceptional love story.Writing is amazing. Yes, the plot and the entire concept maybe simple but it's clear that the writers spent a lot of time enriching this simplicity. Every corner you see something significant if you pay attention. There are moral lessons to be learned but those are never thrown to your face. Well, sometimes they do.. literally :)Actors did a great job. Both Jodie Comer and Joe Keery did a great job filling in the lead role shoes. I already knew and loved Joe.

They just put whatever together as long as it serves to push the plot forward no matter how little sense it makes!It has some nice or funny moment, I'll admit that. And Ryan Reynold did his best to save the movie both in his role in the movie and on the internet, but is that enough to redeem a 2 hour movie with a ridiculous plot and execution? Well, it depends, if you're like me and it's important for you to stay immersed in the story, then no, there's too many ridiculous inaccuracies in the movie to stay immersed.

649,biggyofmt,Very disappointing,4,17 October 2021,"There's a kernal of a good movie burdiewd somehwere in here under the bloated run time and fan service.Ryan Reynolds is charming as the NPC who starts living and has good enough chemistry with Jodie Comer. The real life representation of a GTA 5 like city where PCs come in and do whatever they want is visually very impressiveThe real world sequences are not nearly as charming, with the exception of Taika Waititi as the burning man attending villian of a CEO. The sequences showing streamers and other people reacting to the story are particularly egregious. I would like to see a cut where that real world portion is cut entirely, I think it might be a case of addition by subtraction. The cheering or maudlin tears of the bystanders is a guide on how to feel. You're a brainless NPC, you need to be told to cheer.On that note, how do the NPCs know what Guy reaching the island means. How do all those stream bros? Free Life was never even released, nobody is going to see a silhouette of an island and be like ""OH MY GOD"".The real world story also serves to highlight how unrealistic portions are. Particularly egregious is the idea that the creators couldn't stop a character from reaching some place or other, but they can build bridges and move buildings. Or that smashing random server slices with an axe will only cause little bits of bridge to flicker out of existence. Clearly whoever wrote that is not a programmer.It's funny, because I don't have a problem with Wreck-it Ralph in this way, which is even less realistic. The inclusion of a real world to echo into just underscores it I guess.Other issue that jump to mind - Why are they chasing him like they can't just jump high? The Jump Shoes are literally an item in the game and they are devs with god mode access. Just give yourself jump shoes!In the end, being jerked along told how to feel by the bystander scenes and the complete lack of internal logic makes it a pass for me.",Free Guy

However, what happens when one of the NPCs named GUY out of chance gets to become the main character of the game is that he realizes that how the life of an NPC is different from that of the people who play the main characters in the game , he realizes how free they are and how restricted or rather subdued the NPCs are.You could call this film as the revolt of the NPCs, sounds fun xD. For gamers, it's a treat to watch this film. Amazing CGI with random tanks, jets flying around like in a game gives you the perfect in-game feeling. Also, you could say this film highlights the imaginary rift between coders who code the NPCs and the NPCs trying to get out if their hard coded characters.

It's an overall fun experience with some great actors. Ryan Reynolds does a remarkable job playing an npc or maybe it's because he's so loveable I'll enjoy anything that he's in.The story is pretty simple and easy to follow which is good because who really puts on a comedy for intricate story telling?The main villain played by Taika Waititi is refreshing he simply doesn't give af that or he has no idea what he's doing or what's going on which is more realistic than your average movie bad guy. The ones who are super smart and have all these over the top synical unrealistic ways bad guys usually do to interfere with the protagonists plans.The only thing I didn't enjoy were the streamers but that's only because I believe streamers ruined the gaming industry but thats a whole other story.TL:DR - Enjoyable mindless fun with a great cast.",Free Guy

From the trailer I was expecting an out and out comedy, but in fact the humour was quite restrained (apart from one scene towards the end), whilst the story had more depth and range.I was expecting Deadpool 2, but found it was closer to a cross between Ready Player One and The Truman Show, but with Ryan Reynolds' comedy style sprinkled over the top.This was no bad thing though, and afterwards our whole group agreed that it was a great film and worth recommending.",Free Guy

I can take a movie with a moral. But this movie could have been a 4 star with one message instead lets add a bunch of leftist nonsense in a movie that doesn't need it. Not sure how much input a Director has but he took the job. Lastly probably due to they lost just a bit of traction with the lack of chemistry guessing COVID and movies.. I could have overlooked that. Still has moments that are great worth a rental not a buy. Time to stand up like Guy and voice our opinions on the messages coming out of Hollywood with our money.

He just keeps getting better. The rest of the cast was outstanding, and the film is just pure fun on every level. It also ends up being rather touching without being maudlin. A lovely afternoon at the movies. Thank you!",Free Guy
664,angelamiatt,Ryan Reynolds - what's the fuss?,3,2 November 2021,"I think I'm the only person in the world who doesn't find Ryan Reynolds funny.He seems to play the same deadpan character in every film. Sometimes it fits, deadpool, and at times like this it fails miserably.I have a low tolerance on films, I will watch anything and find virtue but this... well this was dull.Even taika waititi couldn't save this for me and I LOVE him!Watch Boss Level with Mel Gibson instead. Far superior!",Free Guy

666,Alpbat,close ups that suck,5,6 September 2021,"As most reviews admit Free Guy is a popcorn movie to pass your time.However there are flaws that make your popcorn and time taste a little bitter and unpleasant. Particularly, the close ups of the other guys behind their laptops; the ones which appear many, many times and often unnecessarily so much so that the action scenes and their continuity, as well as the joy of spectators, are disrupted.Mr. Director, Mr. Studio cut many of those embarrassing close ups.",Free Guy

669,thecommentarrbox,Emoji Movie + Pixels =Free Guy (OVERRATED),5,24 September 2021,I was curious to know why people were liking this film so much. Ones I done watching I realised it's just an average movie. I love Ryan Reynold's films. I even enjoy his creative ads in YouTube but Free Guy is the first movie which hardly made me laugh. Even if you watch this movie with you're brain off you still feel what you watch is stupid. The makers doesn't seem to understand how video games works in real world. The makers didn't even take a time make us understand the context of Free City game. At most of the time I felt like the Idea for Free Guy is taken from The emoji movie and guess what? I liked The emoji movie better. Even Ryan Reynold's acting felt annoying most of the time. There are some scenes that are entertaining but mostly it is overrated. The same attention should've give to 'Ready Player One' that movie deserves way more appreciation than Free Guy.If it's not Ryan Reynold's than you see this movie sinking. In this pandemic people watch anything for an escape and this was the break.Watch it if you have nothing better this weekend.,Free Guy
670,tonyw-16090,Disappointing,6,14 August 2021,"I'm a big Ryan Reynolds fan but don't get the great reviews for this. It's so unoriginal. They've just taken bits from ready player one, the Truman show and the Lego movie and made a ""new"" movieYes the effects were great and the acting is first class but the vast majority of the jokes fell flat for me.",Free Guy

He met Jodie Comer's character and discovers things about his world. There's also a real life part of the film, with Joe Keery, Jodie Comer again, and Taika Watiti.These are all great names. And with amazing direction, an original idea and great execution is what makes Free Guy such an endlessly entertaining film.This is a short review because i want to let you see it yourself and be amazed by how good Free Guy actually is.Did I enjoy it? Yes. Is it a flawless masterpiece? Maybe not. Did I smile throughout the whole film just because how fun it is? Hell yeah.",Free Guy
676,VT-Kingdom,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Beyond the pop culture references and adventure is symbolism of a beautiful sacrifice.,9,20 August 2021,"This is perhaps the best movie of 2021 so far. It's easy to get lost in the world of Free City, and you never quite know where the story is taking you next. The final scenes of the movie are some of the most exciting I've seen since Ready Player One and I can't wait to see Free Guy again. I'm actually writing notes for a podcast I'm going to do on the symbolism I found in the movie. This is a triumph. This is a yes for me.",Free Guy
677,LooseTooth,Nice idea but so boringly corporate,1,30 September 2021,"To be honest, if these type of ideas were done on a smaller budget and with less interference from corporate and political agendas. It would be nice.But thats not the case, so If your aware of trigger words that are used to embed ideology into young impressionable minds, then your in for a very uncomfortable ride with this level of movie making.I want to be ENTERTAINED not socially ENGINEERED!!!!I checked out after hearing the new buzz word ""white privilege""Nasty.",Free Guy
678,madorosh,Fun but baffling,5,21 August 2021,"Ryan Reynolds obviously steals the show as the super-likable hero. All the acting is good except for the ""heavy"", though perhaps his continual mangling of pop culture references is a deliberate comment on his personality. The effects are obviously very good. Not so good are the constant and unnecessary blasphemes, foul language and vulgar sexual references which will go over the heads of the younger viewers and honestly add nothing to the film. In common with any other video game movie, you'll have to check your brain at the door. Given a room full of computer servers why would it occur to anyone - dumb villain or otherwise - to attack it with a hatchet rather than just, you know, cut the power. Many other similar questions, which shouldn't interfere to the fun on the screen as long as you remind yourself it doesn't matter. No real surprises or twists and of course the obligatory happy ending which you see coming before the film is even half over.",Free Guy

Still, I knew this is a Ryan Reynolds movie but his tone is much better. Not that I don't like the r rated deadpool jokes, but this movie was way more sophisticated with its jokes.

684,qwmarcus,Video Game Movie Done Right,8,13 August 2021,"While the majority of video game movies suck due to not being like the game they're based on, Free Guy has the advantage of being an original story based in a video game. Ryan Reynolds performance as Guy is great as per usual, the plot is original enough to be interesting, and the comedy (for me) hits right! Without getting into the spoilers, the pop culture references work better than expected. The only complaint I have is the streamer cameos were kind of dumb and they spent way too much time with them. Besides that Free Guy is a great popcorn movie and I highly recommend it!",Free Guy

The mix of comedy sci fi and romantic comedy shouldn't work here but in some strange way it does.

However, there were many parts where left-leaning politics were just shoved in. White privilege, gender roles and ""the patriarchy,"" and gun violence in America are notable mentions. I want to be able to sit down and watch a movie without other people's politics being shoved in my face. It really put a damper on a great movie and they added nothing to the plot, it was just plopped in there with no real purpose and they were never alluded to again after they were mentioned, one after another.",Free Guy

In fact both Deadpools are better than this movie. Same superhero character. With worse jokes. And uninspired kills. For instance, they stole the lame Girl-shooting-while-riding-backwards motorcycle stunt from Knight and Day. And the Antoine Mogul character, tries way too hard to be clever / edgy but ends up just being annoying. The leads are supposed to be in love. But have zero chemistry.

begins with a high-concept premise that's so much fun and full of potential : A generic NPC in a computer game inspired by ""Grand Theft Auto Online"" realizes that his entire world is a simulation. Idea seems interesting and exciting right yes the movie is more than exciting. It's an awesome joy ride never had this much fun in a long time.Ok now let's keep the fun aside. Free Guy is fkn brilliant on every level. A rollercoaster ride of emotion and creative action scenes. And hiding behind everything is a beautiful romantic movie. Special mention the friendship track it was more than beautiful. Hollywood level graphics, that's it u wanna know.There was this one scene which is a fun reference, I literally had goosebumps and it was fkn lit you will know what I'm talkin about.Easily one of the greatest movies i've seen.It's so awesome.

So bizarre to see Jacksepticeye star in this movie (for those that don't know him, Jacksepticeye is a popular Twitch streamer), also Pokemane(?) (Another twitch streamer).And obviously our very own kiwi actor Taika Waititi who played Antoine. Feels even better when NZ actors get big roles and our country is actually acknowledged <3
Ryan Reynolds does some great movies (with the exception of Detective Pikachu - sorry, that movie was poison), so it was no surprise that I had a few good laughs through this film and actually sat still. Not a lot of movies entertain me long enough these days to do that. Basically this movie is like a mash-up of Ready Player One, GTA, and honestly, a bit of Valerian and the City of a thousand Planets.I do recommend giving this movie a watch!.",Free Guy

700,fatclyde_uk,Could have been great,6,29 September 2021,"First things first. Ryan Reynolds is not my favourite actor by a long chalk. Anything with him in it could be improved 300% by having a decent quality actor in his place. He's acceptable in this role but still highly annoying if you feel as I do about his goofy, unfunny quips and ridiculous one dimensional persona.This is a great idea for a film and really needed a serious take on the story rather than the silly, glib effort that we got. NPC's developing their own thoughts and acting on them opens up a multitude of options but we're stuck with (free) guy loves girl bs. A dark comedy would have been superb for this material. It reminded me a bit of the infinitely superior Stranger Than Fiction.Still good fun but, RR, arghhhh !",Free Guy

I. with the kid from the sixth sense. And yes I know, many of you are inclined to give this a great rating because Ryan Reynolds is a foul-mouthed darling, but have you ever seen his acting range?

Step forward Free Guy and Ryan Reynolds. Yet again a wacky variant of Reynolds grinning through sun par material all the way to the bank.Despite reviewers praising Comer I felt she came across as pedestrian as the NPCs in the film and there was nothing to suggest this was the same actress gaining plaudits for her TV work.Waititi was just annoying and is proving that behind the camera is his prime position.The only smile came from ""that cameo"" and the shield but lightsaber just milked the moment and soured the experience.A star for the cameo/shield moment - a few seconds of fun in nearly two hours of monotony.",Free Guy

Broad frenetic humour leaves you wondering why they left the swearing in. I don't know how long it was but it felt like an eternity, in fact it might still be running and I have accepted my eternal punishment. I wonder if the roll called for it and it was done tastefully would Ryan Reynolds consider not playing Ryan Reynolds in a movie.

Not to mention the way technology is represented in the movie is so laughably removed from its real world equivalent that it shatters your immersion constantly.This movie appeals to the dumb masses like its life depends on it and by making its money back, it proves the opposite of its message.",Free Guy
709,jenniferbellydancer,Very funny action comedy,7,23 August 2021,"I was on the fence with this one, but I decided to give this movie a try and hopefully get some laughs out of it, and I was surprised I did.I find Ryan Reyonlds to be so great at action comedy and he definitely didn't disappoint in this one. There were just the right amount of cute, sweet, and funny moments. There were even some pop cultural references, but it made me laugh!I think the only thing I did not like was the same old story of how two people of the opposite gender are best friends and they end up falling in love. It's a story that is often told and I wish Hollywood would stop putting this idea into people's heads that two people of the opposite gender can't be just really great friends.Other than that, this movie was really cute and funny and would highly recommend it!!",Free Guy

There's almost no doubt that you'll have a great time with it. A charismatic Ryan Reynolds delivers a great performance and the rest of the cast including Jodie Comer, Joe Keery and Taika Waititi was pretty convincing as well.Some of the situations and actions were a bit contrived and this takes away a little bit from the movie and so does the rather cliché ending. The ending did leave me slightly teary eyed and I suppose my complaints are things that you expect from a movie of this type anyway.A Recommended watch. 77/100SPOILERS FROM HERE:The treatment of the coding behind all the AI and the explanations in the movie are pretentious and I did get the feeling that the writer didn't know much of what he's talking about.The way in which the writer connected the reality of our lives with that of NPCs with artificial intelligence is clever. The writer poses important questions about Artificial Intelligence and the ethics involved in treating entities that possess it like many other movies before albeit in a lighthearted fun way.",Free Guy

I'm a Reynolds fanboy and I'm not afraid of saying so and hell, does he not disappoint me at all in this one. Free Guy is pure dinamite. Okay, you need to like video games, or at least be able to enjoy something strongly related to them, in order to have fun with it. But just sit down, relax and watch it. This is visual porn. This is a movie worth watching in a huge screen (I already know it won't be the same to see it on my TV at home). It's visually STUNNING, guys. The CGI is so-so-good. You really believe how the world is build. And it's a lot of SE.The cast is also amazing to say the least specially when it comes to the Reynolds-Comer tandem (Am I the only one who thinks of DMC3 ""Lady"" character when I see her in the movie?). They have so much chemistry together! And you know. As predictable as the main plot can be... It's honestly like playing a video game you already know how it's gonna end but you know you'll truly enjoy the journey. And I never thought a movie would make me care so much about NPCs. Lmao.Maybe my least fav part was Taika Waititi. I usually enjoy a lot his films as a director and I don't dislike his many late cameos on some movies. But here... Idk. His villainous Antwan feels... ""Over exaggerated"" maybe? But that's not killing anything in the movie anyway. And it's a really, really enjoyable one. If you haven't gone seen it yet I don't know what you're waiting for.",Free Guy

The movie was very humorous for parents and youth, thanks to Ryan Reynold's comedy genius. The concept was great and the you-tuber cameos made my kids freak out- in a good way. We all really enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to others.",Free Guy

729,seagull30,Fun but forgettable,7,31 October 2021,Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds. Some fun cameos and couple of laugh out loud moments. Strangely Taika Waititi is the worst thing in it. He is way over the top with his performance it's irritating. Enjoyable but it's that type of film you probably won't rewatch.,Free Guy

Funny, great concept and surprisingly it tugged at my heartstrings.

731,jancapek-cz,Yet another product of our infantilized era.,3,25 September 2021,"Technically speaking, there's nothing wrong with this film. Mildly entertaining, skillfully shot, and - if you think Deadpool humor gets better the more there is of it - somewhat humorous.And yet, I hated everything about it. Back in the days, 40 and 50 year old men on screen were adults. Whether it was Michael Douglas as a cheating husband in ""Fatal Attraction,"" Robert Redford as a CIA researcher in ""Three Days of the Condor,"" Steve McQueen as a liutenant Frank Bullitt in ""Bullitt"", or Dustin Hoffman as a struggling father in ""Kramer vs. Kramer"". They spoke like adults, acted like adults, and were exposed to credible, adult life situations.Those days seem to be gone. The Hollywood of the 21st century thinks that what we need is endless superhero nonsense, fatuous comedies with middle aged characters doing their best to appeal to young audiences, or uninventive, woke remakes full of characters that... apart from trying hard to appeal to young audience, assure us that it is the precious feelings of the easily offended, children-like adults that we should have at our hearts.""Free Guy"" is another product of Hollywood that says ""it is okay to have an aging population, as long as we all remain children."" One should not blame a single movie for this, but as long as ""Free Guy"" is a safe, revenue guaranteeing cliché of that culture, one can feel somewhat justified in giving it three stars.",Free Guy

742,ajp2012,Gamers will love this.,9,25 September 2021,"As you can see, there are some dismal ""1/10"" ratings from individuals who most likely have nothing to do with the gaming community, or just determined to slate this movie because it has similarities to The Trueman Show, The Matrix, Groundhog Day and Ready Player One.I really pity those people who refused to see the entertainment value and instead focus on the irrelevant aspects that most people couldn't care less about.For me personally as an ""80s to present"" gamer, and youtube streamer, I found this movie absolutely fantastic, capturing many elements of modern open world games and the gaming community itself. There are many things that modern gamers will find relatable, and for me personally was when they mentioned that they never knew a particular part of the city existed. I think we have all experienced someone say that at some point. I also really liked seeing a player ""tea bagging"" a dead victim which I only experienced myself recently whilst playing Battlefield 5.As for the cast and script, Ryan Reynolds was absolutely the right person for the lead character, with some hints of Deadpool humour too. Just typical Ryan Reynolds humour in all honesty. The script was actually very good, in keeping with what the movie wanted to achieve. Blue shirt guy was always supposed to be a relatively simple and straight forward person, who showed elements of ""noob"" talk when he discovered new things. Again all relatable.It is a great film, however the self proclaimed wannabe movie critics will be out in force to bring the score down. This is a 7-8/10 movie all day long so don't be fooled by those reviews. Most notable, rating a movie 1/10 then proceeding to state they turned it off after 15 minutes. ? Really?Anyways Enjoy. :)",Free Guy

745,romeroposadadaniel,Great Popcorn movie with the amazing Ryan Reynolds,7,2 October 2021,"The first half of the movie was simply put amazing. The second half didn't seem as out there and take the same risks in story that the first half did and was very heavy-handed with the connections with the real world. There was also less Ryan Reynolds in the second part, so it might have just been that :)If you're looking for some good laughs from an extremely likeable cast of characters (even Taika's villain is extremely likeable) and don't mind a bit of heavy-handed brand- and streamer-placement, this is the movie for you. Don't worry about the plot, that's not really the point of the movie anyways. The point is that Guy and Buddy are best friends!",Free Guy

Furthemore, the plot does not just copy the games but develops their own story with AI. If you liked Ready Player One, you will definitely like it. The plot is also similar to another fantastic movie, but I don't want to spoil it. For me, it is definitely the year's best movie and one of the best movies overall.",Free Guy

752,gabrielgarbagni,The Perfect Summer Flick,10,18 August 2021,"Free Guy is a movie that knows exactly what it wants to be: an action comedy that masterfully balances funny scenes to emotional moments. Shawn Levy was able to create a joyful world that celebrates pop culture, while at the same time manages to convey a sweet and powerful message. The characters are cool and likable, especially the protagonists played by Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer. Being a gamer myself, I had a blast watching this story come to life, looking for references and easter eggs, exploring the endless possibilities that the screenplay had to offer. I recommend it to anyone who wants to laugh, smile and feel excited at this colorful spectacle.",Free Guy
753,b-app,Amazingly and cleverly entertaining!,8,14 August 2021,"An absolute gem of an action comedy. So many fun Easter eggs and references.

As a gamer and PC enthusiast, I really enjoyed all the references to real games there is during pretty much all the movie, made me nostalgic!That's a comedy but the background story is also really heartfelt, and it somehow shows the passion game developers are putting into their work as well as how it can affect their personal lives. It also shows the dark side of the gaming industry, some people are there for the passion, others just for the money...Funny while being heartfelt at the same time, what can we ask more?Once again, Ryan Reynolds hits the right spot !I went there with little expectations, it ended up as one hell of a ride!",Free Guy

761,gncfs,Don't Think Too much Guy,5,11 October 2021,"It looked good. I loved the cg.The romance plot in this is cringe and frankly childish. This movie is geared more towards teens and kids who loves games. I definitely would have enjoyed this more if I didn't question everything, but I just couldn't accept;
Blue Guy's odd attraction towards Milly. (The reason is revealed later)
Everyone keeps saying the NPC's an hacker, but how do they accept that so smoothly anyway?The Game itself is online GTA, nothing special about it, even with some AI lifeform.Milly falling for some random guy in a game, and she's also the creator of the game right. (The reason is revealed later.)
Blue Guy's outrage after the reveal that everyone he knew was an AI. (Such an emotional AI)
The Anton character was infuriatingly annoying. (He should have employed the programmers, he didn't need to be such an idiotic evil villain)
Milly's attachment towards Guy after erasing his memories, but they claim they can't replicate him. (He comes back with an kiss)
I watched for the spectacle of the cg visuals. Character, plot, narrative, script was just meh. It was an overall enjoyable film. I just couldn't root for anyone. One one of these social commentary stuff regarding NPCs.",Free Guy
762,alleteaure,10/10,9,2 September 2021,I just watched Free Guy last night and it was the best movie I've seen all year and the best movie I've seen in a very long time that isn't a part of a huge franchise yet expertly uses huge franchises as Easter eggs. It's arguably one of Ryan Reynolds most interesting roles it has great action great comedy and actually a very adorable love story all rolled up into a amazing concept for a video game let alone a movie. Hit perfectly tizen stories from The Real World and within the video game called Free City. Also has tons of cameos from huge actors reacting to the video game and even very well-known YouTube video game streamers and content creators. It has also has amazing special effects. This movie get a 10 out of 10 there is nothing to complain about in this movie it is a perfect movie! If you want to see a great summer blockbuster go and see Free Guy for something completely different and out of the normal summer blockbuster.,Free Guy
763,muntaqaakhan,Film with video game concept.,10,3 October 2021,"When I saw its trailer, it was so funny, an NPC calls, himself Guy in a video game world, inadvertently wears a glasses which connects to the Players who plays the playable character.When I saw the film, I laughed so hard about this film because of its humor. It was so funny. Ryan Reynolds was always great at comedy. I always loved Ryan Reynolds because he makes us laugh. Taika Waititi,who played Korg in Marvel Cinematic Universe, was more funnier in this film but if he use a American accent in this film, it would be great. Chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer were so great.It was great and funny film I ever saw in my life.",Free Guy

768,Mesina02,Virtual Mess,5,16 August 2021,"Video game movies or movies about video games tend to fall on the wrong side of the spectrum. They're not all bad but the majority can be categorized as a massive disappointment. Free Guy doesn't fall under that batch but it still is not as good as it hoped to be.I would say that the bright spot of this film is easily Ryan Reynolds. His charisma and sense of humor is on par with this movie's style. He is by far the best thing about the film and I knew that would be the case before I even saw the film but I wouldn't be surprised if that was other people's expectations as well.To me, what trumps Free Guy into mediocrity is that it feels too corny and acts like one big cliché. The first act really sets up this virtual world quite well but it's the second act where it fails to keep up. The climax along with the ending were really predictable with the final fight scene being a massive fan service.In the end, I wouldn't call Free Guy a bad movie. It's a fun film that is entertaining the whole way through but obviously it's problem's are too obvious to not point out and that's what ultimately is the downfall of the film.",Free Guy

The premise is interesting and engaging, the CGI is awesome, the lead and supporting characters did a great job, and several famous individuals make appearances (which were fun to spot).

Free guy does not. After that somehow the lighthearted movie turn dark, like Trueman dark, but without the dept. In the end, the romance is just wrong. It should be Avatar or Sixteen candles. There is no chemistry between those two.It is a generic Ryan Reynolds movie with a bunch of easter eggs and cameos and nothing more. I wish it was more. The cast deserves more.

Full of inconsistencies and mistakes, example, how can you feel guns in his pockets through a keyboard? Nonsense stuff like that ruined it for me.Also I'm gaming everyone was a bad guy and he was the first good guy? Nonsense I've played many games where I don't kill civilians or cops. So did millions of gamers.And how did the npc see through those glasses? That's not even coded in the game.

Anyways those movies are far from being good 'cause references are its strength.Not the case with Free GUY.MINIMUM SPOILER ALERT!!At the beginning, I felt the NPCs weren't behaving as normal NPCs. This made me think the movie was going to be just another stupid film mocking videogames. Later, that ""reason"" is explained.This premise, I'll call it ""The reason"" is what makes the movie work so well and makes it different from other Videogame Reality based films.The Reason gives a layer of caring for the characters of the film. The Reason is what makes the film play smartly funny combined with Reynolds essence, and it's because both of them the not_so_explicit references land smart instead of being just idiotic.Even The Reason gives us a life lesson!Because of this, Free Guy makes you care about characters, both human and not human, because the second ones mostly exist just to fill the background.Free Guy can criticize the negatives of actual trends, specifically Youtuber carrers, but at the same time respects them.Free Guy respects his audience at all times, both gamers and non gamers.

As a gamer, when jokes show, you'll laugh with everyone else 'cause they're far from offensive.This is why I consider Free Guy highly recommended.",Free Guy
791,eliorberkovich,Jesus christ this man just don't miss,7,16 August 2021,"This movie is just incredible.. it doesn't have perfect writing (not even close actually), has a lot of inconsistencies, and is generally kind of a mess when you try to analyze it. But it's so goofy it is incredible and it's hard not to love it.Bunch of cameos, dumb moments that will leave you on the floor, and a lot of references to any game and movie genera that has ever existed.Here is the plat in a short sentence *not spoiled*an ""NPC"" (non-playable character) wakes up to his perfect world (at least from his perspective) and lives his life as what he was meant to be: a puppet that has been created to make the experience of the game players a little more fun. But when he stumbles upon this woman who gamming one of his favorite songs he starts to gain awareness and free will. He goes through some talking with her and becomes a player who make good deeds instead of killing ""NPCs"" like a maniac. I won't tell you who is the lady he met or what is the main story in this movie but I would definitely recommend watching it.",Free Guy
792,alexnielsen-98723,The movie we all need,9,1 November 2021,This movie is what we all need this year. This movie is the feel good movie of the year and is fun all the way through. Ryan Reynolds carries the comedy all the way through. The subtle references to video games is fantastic. All in all a great comedy that we need so much.,Free Guy
793,stevegriffin-93522,Average film,5,6 November 2021,I like Ryan Reynolds. But this film didn't work for me as it didn't keep me interested. I left the cinema on a pretext at one point and when I got back it was more or less in the same place viz a viz storyline. Maybe if I was under 30 years old I would have appreciated it more as in I would have 'got it'.,Free Guy
794,Kidkungie,Fun but not fresh,6,29 September 2021,The movie is beautiful to watch and the cgi effects are fun but the characters are just not it. It feels like if you took every stereotype of tech bros and gaming nerds and shoved them into a movie. Mr. Waititi seems confused on whether he's playing a 40 year old man holding onto his 20s or a ruthless business man. Then there's the random inputs of twitch streamers and YouTubers that you're like alright now that's enough. The plot feels like you've already seen the movie with it being a mix of ready player one and Truman show with no surprises or changes to the plot it kind of feels like Netflix made it. Definitely one for the kids.,Free Guy
795,nataliem09,Awesome cameos and really funny!,10,17 August 2021,Saw this movie in theaters with my friend and it was great! Everything about it was really creative and the comedy was a good type of cringey. Definitely recommend seeing it when you can.,Free Guy

The story and characters were all equally flat and non-compelling. I didn't care about any of them, or their motivations. Taika Waititi's character was a caricature and his overacting was painful to watch. Granted, he didn't seem to have too much to work sith; all his lines were cringy. The writers were clearly trying to make him funny and it ended up coming across way too try-hard.The only good thing about this film was using a Mariah Carey song (arguably the best one to boot) as the main musical feature.

801,llydlester-16065,Free Guy Film Review,9,29 September 2021,"Great film for every person who loves video games and Ryan Reynolds!!! ''Free Guy'' is unique as an action-comedy, yet, amazing thruway of its depth - exploring love, interpersonal connection, betrayal, and courage. With a unique hand, regular Ryan Reynolds and this world do a top-notch job conserving entertainment throughout. As a love story, gaming tribute, comedy, action ""Free Guy"" is a vivid and colourful, action-packed family film with unique laughs and even a couple of shocking cameos that will make you smile. ""Free Guy"" is a love letter to the gaming world that delights in its wackiness. Like many a big-budget video game Live-action adaptations, ""Free Guy"" can be a little buggy here and there; and in turn, is one-of-a-kind, and in addition now no longer the regular fare. This film is pure fun, stirring up the worlds of reality- and video gaming including artificial intelligence and giving us one of the most necessary entertaining and hilarious romcoms of the year. ""Free Guy"" is light, barring issues, consumable enjoyment that can additionally in no way decrease our collective love for all matters Ryan Reynolds. ""Free Guy"" is the full video, especially for Reynolds, exercising films and wanting to be noticed. His extraordinary comedic performances here are one of the most spectacular I have ever witnessed in a blockbuster since Reynold's Deadpool movies, giving a classic and traditional performance. Taika Waititi's over-the-top man-child of a villain, makes ""Free Guy"" what it is - a blast. ""Free Guy"" sets the bar high as the new mark for video games adaptation films; however, it has received sufficient laughs and spectacle for audiences to plug in and disconnect for two hours. One of the unique and funniest movies I have watched this year; full of action and humour, paying loving tribute to video games, even satirizing the eccentricities and quirks of a ""gamer"" culture. ""Free Guy"" is one of the brightest movies on gaming and the gaming business, as well as maybe the funniest comedy about intellectual property rights ever created - and the clear one that actually does it justice. This film is the big-hearted ride fantastic blockbuster audiences have been begging for since March 2020. ""Free Guy"" is a really amusing and emotional game-inspired action film, vastly charming and, on the extraordinary hand, heartfelt game-inspired action blockbuster. Something about its approach to every blockbuster movie and Ryan Reynolds' big-name vehicle is exceptional."" With a few exceptions, Free Guy is one of the year's funniest and most intriguing flicks. A film with a brilliant twist from Reynolds and Comer. ""Free Guy"" has emerged as the biggest surprise of the summer, barring issues, one of 2021's funniest and most fascinating films.",Free Guy
802,athreya-91055,Fun to watch. Not extrordinary,6,25 October 2021,The movie is fun to watch. Worth a view.

803,FinalSmash1689,An EXCELLENT Summer Movie!!!,8,15 August 2021,"Free Guy SPOILER Review:PROS:-Jodie Comer is the heart of this movie! She holds both sides of the story together and she NAILS IT!-Ryan Reynolds is charming and funny as always. You can tell he had a fun playing this role.-Joe Keery does a surprising job as the guy torn between the girl he likes and the job he needs.-Lil Rel Howery brings a fun energy to Buddy and shows his fear about the truth of his reality really well.-The videogame world is established well, as are the 'rules' of how the game operates and if you're a gamer there's a ton of fun easter eggs!-The reason behind why Guy becomes 'free' actually surprised me, which is hard to do these days.-The entire 2nd half of the film kept me on the edge of my seat!-The cameos!-The Special Effects were fun to see on the big screen!CONS:-Taika Waititi was a little too over the top for me. I know there are people like that in the world, but it was a bit much!-The pacing was a little too fast in the first half but was more balanced in the second half.I had a blast with this movie! I went in expecting a fun time, but this movie has a surprising amount of heart at the center of it! The story does a great job of balancing the game world and the real world. I loved how what was happening in one affected the other. Ryan Reynolds does a fantastic job, but Jodie Comer is the reason to revisit this film again! I laughed a lot, but I felt a heartwarming smile on my face more! I don't have any real complaints about this film, it's just a really great time at the cinema!

805,ChanithaWeerasinghe,"The best video game movie with a great interesting story line, comedy and action.",8,10 October 2021,"Free Guy is a story about ""Guy"", a bank teller in Free City, which is a video game. He even doesn't know that the world he is living in the game! When Guy finally meets the fantasy girl in his mind, he discovers that his world is a game and it's about to fall apart. Together, Guy and his fantasy girl must take a huge risk to save the world that Guy knows.This movie was really cool, amazing and I loved the story because it is very different and unique than any other game movie. But I didn't like the flow of it at the beginning. It was a bit not so entertaining. Anyway when it got to the line of the story I got powered and fell in love with the story.Another thing which I didn't like was that little kids used some inappropriate words for their age. However the movie was action packed and very funny too. This movie shows the power of friendships/ relationships/ affairs even between video game characters and real human beings.Free Guy is the best video game movie with a great interesting story line, comedy and action.",Free Guy

808,dwpenn,Save yout $2 and the time you wold spend watching.,1,4 November 2021,"It s everything that was wrong with TRON (1980) and everything wrong with Matrix (1999) combined into one sufferingly long film (I can't seem to call it a 'movie'). Granted people under 50 may not even know what TRON was, so let's just say it was a BOMB, fortunately Jeff Bridges recovered. AOL died off not long after it partnered to push out MATRIX and no wonder AOL employees received free DVDs of it; they knew ahead of time they'd have some extra copies. I like Ryan Reynolds, but I can't imagine his recovering from this p.o.c. And he didn't add value to it, he was misused. It's not worth renting, save the $2. This definitely unseats Genghis Khan as one of the worst movies in movie history. Recall Genghis Khan was so bad Howard Hughes bought every copy on the face of the earth to keep them from being distributed. In his lifetime that was a successful maneuver. However copies of Genghis Khan can be seen today because after Howard died they were a part of his estate, and one of the beneficiaries sold the prints to Universal. John Wayne as Genghis Khan was a bad idea, Ryan Reynolds as ""blue shirt guy"" was even worse. If this film was shown to test audiences in private screenings the studios could have saved promotional costs, and maybe they did.",Free Guy

813,mike-nichols-789-714649,A fun ride that suffers from weak dialog and forced romance,5,27 September 2021,"This movie works for what it is, a platform for Ryan Reynolds to do more Deadpool style sarcastic humor. I enjoyed his performance and thought it was well supported by Lil Rel Howery.I have two problems with this movie that really degraded the experience for me:1. The over use of expository dialog. A lot of the story is said by characters and not shown, which is a shame, and the explanations of the world and its rules are done as if the audience has an IQ of 20. I think the dialog overall needed another pass or two. Also, this is a nitpick, but none of the technical things in the story were even close to accurate. Programmers don't literally work in 1s and 0s. When you launch the next version of a game you don't delete all of the code from the previous game. Hitting the servers with an axe would not slowly remove parts of the world, it would just crash the server. Plus I don't think he was even hitting any hard drives, which would have offsite backup anyway. Lots of little things like that. I mean just turn off the power in the room...2. The forced love story. It reminded me 'Yesterday' in a way, that beetles movie, where the love story was just hamfisted. The movie could just be about an AI become self aware, you don't need a love story. That is not to say a love story is a bad thing, but it felt like it was jammed into the story to satisfy a checkbox.Look, I get it, this movie is not out to win any awards, it's just a fun romp, but for anyone that knows how video games work it can be a bit frustrating to follow the logic.",Free Guy

Second after the first Kiss it is stated that kissing is not programmed into the game and therefore shouldn't be possible. But than after the reboot Millie initiates the kiss herself.Now these are mayor plot moments it always baffles me that big budget movies don't have the proper resources for a good script.PS: If someone buys your game but aren't allowed to use the code why did they buy it in the first place?,Free Guy

It had a lot of neat gamer references and because I am a gamer it was really nice to see. What surprises me is how it all went to garbage in the second half. The entire ending could have been avoided by just shutting down power to the servers and I don't know how much the average gamer knows, but I'm pretty sure they know taking an axe to a server is not necessary to shut it down. It was actually insulting to my gamer intelligence. I was just shocked that they put so much time to impress gamers in the beginning and then in the end, insult their intelligence by suggesting a server needs to be destroyed instead of unplugging a power cord to take it down (or shut it down with a typing command). There were alot of technology plot holes in this. Those are my biggest complaints. Me and my husband actually started to fall asleep halfway in. I'll be reasonable and say I would give the first half of this movie a 6 but the second half was definitely a 3.",Free Guy

I would pit Ready Player One a full star ahead, but this movie is still well worth the watch. It has great acting and CGI, but it felt like more could have been accomplished. The reviews giving this 9-10 stars seem to be muddied by the fans admiration for the two stars of the film. Basically, it is a 6.3/10 but the casting choice puts it up and over into the 7.3 range and makes it an awesome enjoyable flick! The concept of AI in this movie also makes for thoughtful conversation. I recommend seeing it in the theatre.",Free Guy

They are portrayed as fat people or little kids acting like jerks on the internet. This is 2021. We should not be portrayed this way. As gamers we must rise up and fight back against this negative image.As for the actual film I found it rather disappointing, I went in expecting a true video game film, much like the genius works of the first super mario brothers, however I was met instead with a blockbuster made for your parents who have never played a videogame. The conflict is both generic and makes no sense from a business/intellectual property perspective, but is it enjoyable as a generic action film. Yeah I guess. At no point was I incredibly bored, but I also felt like I just watched another big blockbuster hollywood film that is still afraid to embrace video games and what is special about them. I also love Taika Waititi.What this film needed was somebody like Chris Pratt as Mario.",Free Guy

I don't think this was supposed to be another Ready Player One, and it was not. Free Guy is not entirely about the game. It's about everything surrounding it, and what a hilarious, action-packed, and surprisingly emotional story it creates. I wouldn't call myself very engrossed in the world of gaming, but I was smiling from beginning to end regardless. Also the actors are amazing, the world-building is incredibly creative, and again, it's endlessly funny. Free Guy is just that kind of movie that anyone can enjoy.

However, I came in thinking id laugh quite a bit more. It was funny for sure, just not hilarious. The storyline was great though, It had a happy tone through the whole way, the cinematics were great, and considering how poorly the movie industry has been doing this one shines. Its definitely worth the ticket price, but it definitely isnt a movie for elderly who arent into video games (my grandfather didnt care for the movie).

It follows Guy (Ryan Reynolds) as a background character in a video game ""Free City"" and he falls in love with ""MolotovGirl"" (Jodie Comer) and from then it's an action packed, funny, romantic and amazing movie.I like how it focuses much on technology and video games, it easily grabs your attention from the first 10 mins and is a definite watch. It's definitely worth your time, money, and... Your popcorn.9/10.",Free Guy
849,hanthefilmgeek,Wreck It Ralph - but 100000x better.,10,2 October 2021,"As much of a biased Ryan Reynolds fan I am to watch any film he features in, this is by far one of the best films I've seen, (apart from Deadpool)! He is very good at adapting to different film roles, such a fantastic actor. I love how lots of famous people and even YouTube stars featured as important roles in this film to embrace our century of what we watch and who we love. Maybe the older generation who aren't so familiar with any of what the internet is about and how it is portrayed will have more of an understanding of what our generation is actually like and be more invested to know and share with the younger generation and have fun. From start to finish it is laugh out loud funny without being over the top and ruined. The plot twists and storyline is amazing and the graphics are on a whole different level. Honestly I have never seen better bright and brilliant graphics such as those. I can totally understand why this was rated so well by critics which you can't always go by but on this occasion it exceeded everyone's expectations. I am all for any type of film, and after watching both Wreck It Ralph Disney films which have a similar gaming concept and coming from a huge Disney fan, I can confirm that Free Guy is by far a better film for everything in my opinion. Please watch, you won't be disappointed!",Free Guy
850,kaitekelenburg,The worst movie I have ever seen.,1,5 October 2021,"This movie had a great concept which is why i went to watch it. However, the movie was terrible.

Do not watch this movie unless you need some aid in falling asleep.",Free Guy
851,sayak_forever,Hollywood dont understand video games,4,26 September 2021,"As a gamer I can safely say the makers of this movie has no clue how video games work. Video games emulate reality. The more realistic the game is, the more respected it is. But the entire concept of ""Free City"" is how impractical it is. Still I can go with it. But the movie in itself is really not that entertaining. Ryan Reynolds is good at his role but the rest is just bad.",Free Guy

This is something else...The writing of the movie is absolutely phenomenal and thats where I have to give the first credThe movie was commercialised as a shallow action kind of movie centered around Ryan Reynolds but thats not what the movie really isThe real main characters of this film is Joe Keery and Jodie Comer and they both play absolutely phenomenal in this movie.The last thing I have to say about the film is that they should have put the ending of the movie in the scene where Millie and Keys went in to kiss on the street. It would gave the movie an absolutely perfect ending,10/10But they didnt and instead played a few more minutes of reynolds tries to be funny and therefor I cant but give the movie a 9/10 instead.",Free Guy

861,michellashley,Best movie EVER! I'm gonna watch it again... and again.,10,28 September 2021,"Love this movie and was so excited over the matches. There are many NPCs (Ai/Drone/Binary Consciousness) here on Earth stuck on their loop programming. Blind and deaf to any real truth and all their houses are built of straw. They stay ""in character"" exactly like NPCs. Be careful of what you say or they might just glitch, be triggered, or they might only stare off into space and not hear anything at all.When our perspectives of falsity are flicked away it's exactly like putting on a brand new pair of sunglasses (Sol Glasses/perception) or like opening doors of perception into higher dimensions of awareness. Everything requires brand new interpretation when we step out of the shadows of the cave and into the Light of Truth. Most seem to enjoy playing in shadows and interpreting what the shadow puppets do. Sometimes it's frustrating until I remember that master frequency of Compassion. Everyone has the spark of divinity within. All other anothers can be aware of SELF too just like Free Guy.Scripts within, scripts without.The scripts are so obvious now.",Free Guy

Some viewers might recall bits of Ready Player One watching this but overall the concept is unique, refreshing and interesting especially for video game players.Ryan Reynolds is brilliant playing the role of Guy. His comic timing as always is suberb. Jodie Comer looks good and acts well as does Joe Keery. I felt Taika Waititi's role was a little over the top, they could have used him better.The movie is colorful, scenes/sets rich in detail. The pace is good. The romantic bits not forced and put in well. The plot refreshing and uplifting. The stakes not too high.If you are looking for some fun and entertaining movie to watch after a stressful week, Free Guy will be a good pick.",Free Guy

870,sifter42,If you're waiting for that great movie to return to the theaters for... This is the one!,9,18 August 2021,"Freaking amazing! It's not often I walk out of a theater at midnight, and I feel more energetic than when I went in. Honestly I think this movie is the perfect ""in-theater"" comeback movie for 2021. It's one of those movies that you enjoy even more because you have 50 other people laughing with you at a movie. So many good one-liners. So many clever ""if you blinked, you missed it"" moments! Walking out of this movie everyone was talking about all the great moments in the movie. I don't want to give specifics, because any spoilers would take away your potential enjoyment of the movie.Now I will say - I feel like this movie was written for people like me. People who have that nerdy-side. People who play video games and like watching comic book inspired movies. However, even though it is definitely written for a specific audience; they do a great job of making it accessible to most people. I was thinking about that while I looked around at the audience on the way out... There were teenage girls, guys in their 50's, couples in their 20's, etc. Etc. Everyone had smiles on their faces, and they were all excited about what they just saw. The comedy aspects of this movie were really on point. They had jokes that were generally funny to everyone.This movie scratches that same itch that people had with Ready Player One, but with more of a 2000's vibe than anything with the 80's. Free Guy had moment after moment that made everyone laugh and cheer. And come on, Ryan Reynolds was the *perfect* actor for this movie. All of the casting choices were spot on, and there were even some great cameos that I didn't expect to see. Thanks to the movie being based on a video game; they could do things that just are not possible to do in real life. Kind of like a comedy version of The Matrix.I went in this movie with high hopes. For once I wasn't disappointed! Solid 9/10 from me. The only tiny tiny gripe I have with this movie is something with the ending. I won't go into specifics to avoid spoilers... I would just have tweaked one or two things with the ending. Other than that though, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Don't have a good day. Have a GREAT day! 😉",Free Guy

The blend of comedy and action has worked well for him before and I think it does again here.The video game aspect was really cool and the graphics were equally as good. The references to grand theft auto and fortnite were a bit of fun too.Loved the random blink and you'll miss them cameos from big name stars like Hugh Jackman, Chris Evans and Channing Tatum.Not much more to say other than this is a great film (especially the last 20 mins) and it's already got a sequel in the works.

I thought this was going to be like a RR romp through a 'gamer' style world - Deadpool meets Fortnite sort of thing - but sadly not to be.The story is weak, characterisations are clichéd and even the action scenes look half-baked. The humour felt forced and there was zero chemistry between RR and Jodie Comer - TW was 1-dimensional as the bad guy he was so lame.Ultimately, I'm not sure if the script writers knew who they were making this movie for - it ended up being quite exhausting to watch because of the tired tropes and reliance on cliché - it might 'only' be a 12A but the Studio Execs seriously underestimate kids if they think they can get away with lazy film-making like this!

Ryan Reynolds acting consists of repetitive facial expressions and ridiculous one liners. The whole concept should have been shelved. Hollywood continues to churn out this tripe where the CGI seems to be more important than a story. This idea has been done to a certain degree, in a few other movies previously and nothing new is added here. Are we just turning into consumers of mindless drivel bombarded with bright colours and implausible special effects? I think so. Its a movie directed at simple minds who like nothing more than to stare at a screen for an hour or so to pass the time. If you have a brain that requires some semblance of storytelling, give this a miss.

It is a movie I recommand. But don't expect it to be hilarious. Its not. I know it says comedy. But it's more a comedy romantic action packed movie. Its just a great movie with good visuals. Sadly.

930,kosejkbar,Enjoyable cinema flick for video games and Marve fans,9,28 August 2021,"I will start by saying I went to see this movie with no expectations other than liking Ryan Reynolds. I haven't even see the trailer or other cast (which was a nice surprise, I really enjoyed Joe Keery in Stranger Things).Therefore, I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie is very enjoyable, the premise is rather interesting and it's pretty well done. Are there some cliches I'd avoid? Yes. Is it a bit predictable? Yes. Does it worsen your movie experience? Not at all, I still loved it.The one downside I could name is that the movie is not for ""wide audience"".Don't get me wrong, people not familiar with video games and how they work (GTA, The Sims, Fortnite, or in general) and popular movies (MCU, SW) can still enjoy the movie, but some of the best jokes may be lost on them.Another interesting thing is that even a rather ""goofy"" movie like this one reminds you of the very interesting topic of growing importance - the AIs. What's the role of the AIs in the future society? How will we know they are truly self-aware? Do they get some basic rights if they are? The only recent piece of media I can think of that dived into this topic more than this movie was the Sword Art Online: Alicization and War of Underworld seasons (which I thorougly recommend).In overall; this movie was fun and a pleasant surprise.",Free Guy

932,jordanbeeston,This is my new favourite film. (No spoilers),10,31 August 2021,"Honestly came on to IMDB to expect a wave of positive reviews and I see that a couple reviewers have really slammed this for being 'brainless'. I guess that just shows that you literally can not please everyone.For me, this has become my new favourite film. Who am I? No one really, this is just my review but I feel compelled to share it after seeing a couple bad ones which contradict completely what an amazing, funny and heartwarming film I just watched.The storyline seems to spin off slightly different than what I have seen before and even though yes, it does resemble parts of trueman show and parts of the race against time ""wreck it Ralph"" save the world story. I find this to be an original mix and improvement on all accounts. Which says a lot because the prior mentioned are also fantastic films.The character development is really cool, there are some really heartfelt moments for ""guy"" and a few other NPC characters that begin to realise they have free will, while also having development for the ""real world"" characters in their own plots. I find that the scenes and flow of the film are perfect for humour and giving an attention reset so it's not all action or all funny or all heartfelt or all romantic, it's a mix of each when the director felt it necessary. Great job!Ryan Reynolds ... That's all I have to say really. What a great actor. Too much explanation of his skillset just takes away from how good he is and he fits into this plot perfectly. All the other actors are also well placed and a few unexpected faces show up that make for some funny scenes.The concept of the storyline also poses some interesting moral questions about AI and the existential meaning of life ...I did not expect this from a comedy.All in all I can't really give this less than 10/10 ... Because while nothing is perfect, there's not an option for 9.9 on IMDB.Thank you to the whole cast and team that created this, it's been a while since I've watched something that experiments a little, for me you created the perfect slice of entertainment. It would be ironic of you to create a free guy 2 ...but boy it doesn't matter because I could watch this film over and over.",Free Guy

I have absolutely no idea how this movie is not rated MUCH lower. The plot makes ABSOLUTELY no actual sense and is several steps past what Hollywood generally expects you to completely overlook in terms of plot holes and logic. Whoever wrote it must never have touched a computer in their life, and you can see the films only plot twist coming from the start of the movie.

958,rcoll-imdb,A Terrific Non-IP Film We Should Be Seeing More Of,10,12 August 2021,"The film is everything the other reviewers have said - funny, sweet, endearing, strong performances particularly from Reynolds and Comer, and just a hell of a fun time, but what strikes me most about this film is that it's a big budget summer blockbuster based on an original screenplay but not on any existing Intellectual Property. Everyone complains about the amount of sequels, reboots, spinoffs and productions based on popular culture but it's refreshing to see a film get made on the same scale that relies solely on the strength of its cast and premise.Free City most closely resembles Grand Theft Auto Online, but most of the world elements are generic video game clichés so it's not as though you're watching Fortnite: The Movie. This is where it differs from its closest comparison in the last few years, Ready Player One. Both films are different story-wise, but where Free Guy differs is that the video game elements don't drive the story whereas RPO felt a lot like, ""Hey, here's a reference to some pop culture you like"" for 2 hours.I hope Free Guy does well in cinemas, and I'm glad they didn't offer Premier Access streaming on Disney+ because it's the sort of film that deserves to do well. It's a great film in its own right, but it should be a signal flare to other studios (including Disney who probably never would have green lit this unless Free City got turned into Disney Property City) that original screenplays are still worth investing in.",Free Guy
959,akosijasher,The chemistry between the three nailed it!,7,30 September 2021,"I'm gonna start saying that i didn't expect the spectacular concept that was made by Keys and Millie. For me, it was one of the remarkable ideas made in developing or creating these kinds of games.Their idea that the NPC grows on their own and not just mere characters for the real players to enjoy but they can act on their own, have thoughts eventually. It seems unbelievable and hilarios at first but what Guy portrayed was awesome. It maybe not the case for the rest of NPC as shown when they all left but i must say there are still good opportunities and situations for them.Lines/Dialogues were also great and noticeable. If im gonna see this film once again, some lines will never be forgotten in my mind not just the ""have a great day"" and not just a good onepNPC mostly in the games are really standard as what they were programmed to but idk how and why it just hits differently in this film.There are also unwanted scenarios that i notice in the film especially cliché scenarios wherein the protagonists should be stop and most likely that situation only and the ending actually was a bit messy and dumb as was said by antwan in his convo with Millie. Antwan's move to hide the proof is very impressive.I must say this movie still contains a unique concept. It still has freshness thanks to the genius duo Keys and Millie! Man i love the chemistry between Guy and Millie but i must say it's all thanks to the dialogue made by Keys . One sad thing in the film is that Guy is really not a real player in real life but a character that was paralleled to what Keys have made. His boundary was clearly drawn to give way to Keys's brilliant ideas, conclusions that nailed it all! I wanna see more of these two given a great character/roles.",Free Guy

And when they were good, they were very funny.The Channing Tatum stuff was hilarious, even though I stopped playing online 15-20 years before the Fortnite stuff.They made more of an effort in this film than most other ""popular"" film I've seen in 5 years.If you have boys and girls that enjoy video games, this is a no-brainer.For big kids like me, it was great seeing something we could all have a laugh at.It's no ""Jungle Cruise"".",Free Guy

977,bchrsb,"Not funny, not exciting, not worth watching.",3,2 October 2021,"This film is a series of well acted and usually beautifully photographed scenes which, when added together, amount to almost two hours of precisely nothing.There is not a bad performance in the whole thing. Everyone is doing their best. I commend them all for their efforts because it must have been as obvious to them as it will be to anyone that watches it that this film is a waste of time.Clichés have been shamelessly borrowed from a number of moderately good films and mixed together in the hope that something better will emerge. The characters are bland nonentities that occasionally say something witty, but are otherwise forgettable. I can see that it might be possible to feel sympathy for some of them, but any thoughts of rooting for them are swamped by the overwhelming hope that the end of this tedious, bloated nonsense of a film is not too far away.I have to confess that this is not a review of the whole film because I fell asleep for about 15 minutes somewhere after the half way point. I did wake up in time to see the big action climax and the resolution of the story. Being awake while this movie is showing is not recommended.",Free Guy

The story is short, and it is about a video game NPC who grew self-conscious and awareness tries to fall in love with a female player who is in a legal battle with this evil company who stole hers and her boyfriend life work. While watching the movie, the only thing I can think about is ""Fortnite"". Yep, Fortnite. I don't know why but I hope anyone watching this and he's a game savvy can tell me which part of it.

I've been playing games ever since. Even better, I'm like Guy - I don't play the bad guy, so I really enjoyed that part.Only a couple of things I wish - that there had been a nod to (or a bigger one if I missed it) Skyrim and that these guys remake Ready Player One.

I knew it was a Ryan Reynolds movie and had heard about it in so many of his interviews. I always kept myself from checking out the trailer. Mostly because trailers are meant to convince us to watch that movie, but I was already convinced.And today I watched the movie without knowing anything about who guy was supposed to be, and it took me good 15 mins to realize, oh wait he isn't ....!Don't worry, no spoilers here.

Free guy too joins this list and its more enjoyable. It gives a similar experience like Source Code (2011) with more humours and emotional elements. Visually it keeps us more engaged with a fast-paced screenplay. Ofcourse there are some technological terms in the movie, which only software developers will understand those things and they only know if the movie is logically perfect or not, but general audience like me won't be focussing on those. We would just sit and enjoy since it is a popcorn movie.",Free Guy

No movie is without it's flaws and neither is this one.However the joy, the creativity and the performances overall are all sublime. Ryan Reynolds delivers some of his typical lines (although differently of course), and they usually work well, but it's everything else that makes this such a fun ride. Sure it's mainly about guy, but everything around the character is what makes it connect so well.Go watch this if you haven't yet.",Free Guy

I hated going to the movie theaters before Covid because people have gotten so rude with their phones and I have a nice TV at home to watch movies. I love Ryan Reynolds though and we went on a Monday so the theater was basically empty. It was worth donning a stupid mask in August heat (despite being fully vaccinated) until we got to our seats. I'm pretty sure this is the first movie I'd seen in theaters since ""The Last Jedi"" so it's been awhile. Still wish I could've watched it at home, but I'm so glad I went to see it. My husband and I both loved it. He loved the video game references which I didn't catch as often, but it was funny, sweet and actually an ORIGINAL IDEA which is lacking in Hollywood these days. I knew it would be enjoyable, but it really was an excellent movie!",Free Guy

If you're looking for the routine Hollywood misrepresentation of history, culture, or politics this movie isn't for you. It's only meant to make you smile and laugh.

998,katimcbride,A True Gamer Comedy,10,14 August 2021,This was such a layered film! As an avid gamer I sincerely enjoyed the tiny video game details scattered throughout. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious as a background character in a mostly violent game and the supporting cast was beautifully chosen. I didn't find my ADHD brain wandering at any moment - it kept my attention all while laughing HARD. Does anybody remember laughter?It wrapped itself up nicely and I appreciated the heartwarming ending. They really just hit the mark with this one.

The beginning of the movie was a great pop corn flick with a good balance of action and laughs.The later part of the movie first started to struggle when they tried to offer an explanation for something that really couldn't be explained with science.Finally, Millie - a supposed co-creator of a game - didn't seem to know how to code. She is shown playing the game, but she didn't seem to know how any of it really worked.

And I think the movie just met our no-expectations perfectly!It's a lighthearted, funny, somewhat profound love story with tons of Easter eggs, cameos and references half of which I am sure flew above my head as I am not that big of a gamer myself. Despite that I had an absolute blast, mostly thanks to Ryan Reynolds and Jodie Comer really delivering on their respective roles.Sure, it's gimmicky and straight up weird sometimes, with some jokes being forced.

That chickflick with Jennifer whats-her-face that took place in space so the boyfriends wouldn't have to feel like simps buying tickets was cute. Nice move Hollywood Writers Guild.And we all surreptitiously noticed a whole heap of futuristic Twilights like Jupiter Ascending, trespassing upon decades old scifi plotlines as if Mila Kunis' career were a quintessential tinseltown ingredient. But at least those offences didn't need to pay the likes of JackSepticEye and inject powerphrases like 'white privilege' in very unnecessary places.But this latest farce Free Guy is masquerading as a Matrixian movie version of GTA in the trailers when beyond the 3 minute Netflix 'stray threshold' this film is ultimately a version of Her where a nerd girl falls in love with her AI reminiscent of an embarrassingly moustached Joaquin Phoenix.And casting Deadpool was a dick move CSA. A dick move.",Free Guy

As well as being funny, the plot is ACTUALLY good, better than a lot of films nowadays.Ryan Reynolds was the perfect lead actor for this film. You should ABSOLUTELY watch this in the cinema, as you can just get lost in the story.It's definitely ok for kids 12 and over, like it's rated, it's only cartoon cringe kind of violence and a few swear words.And it had such a positive effect on me, when I came out of the cinema I was like, 'Life is great!'",Free Guy

1022,bergguscha,120mio for this? They should have made a video game instead.,7,26 September 2021,"I play games and often read game reviews. Seeing the love-hate relationship between reviewers here, a game (with the same plot) where Ryan tries to save his homeworld might have made more people happy. With even 5hrs of intense gameplay I personally would have been even more happier.A game that doesn't take itself seriously and pokes fun at the stereotypical tropes that are so commonplace in video games, which are both a blessing and a curse. In addition to forums, reviews, and commentary video games, we might see a public display of affection such as this as well. It's all the more surprising that this very film wasn't released earlier by someone else.The dangers he would have fought would have been real. Mean bosses, bank robbers, game administrators, viruses and (lol) other NPCs ... and don't forget to be a good guy and a helping hand in need. In fact, Guy was quite busy leveling up.I like some of Ryan's prominent films, I was glad to see something new, and I see potential entertainment value in a game that would have let us spend more time with the main character.",Free Guy

What is this game even supposed to be? Like some GTA MMO? I'm sure something like that exists on the internet but not any actual major worldwide games. If you're gonna use an MMO it makes more sense to use a fantasy game, if you want a modern action themed game it would usually be single player. Also you are seriously telling me every one of these npcs are sentient and yet not a single one has ever tried to actually talk to someone? Also what is this bs where every single person in this supposedly huge playerbase decides to pick the evil path? Play any game with a morality system and you'll often find quite an amount of players on the 'good' side. Don't even get me started on how little the movie understands what godmode actually is. And that's just the start of it, it's obvious that the writers of this movie know very little about video games. Why make a movie about a hobby you don't have?",Free Guy

How are you supposed to relate to him if his existence is debatable and has like zero feelings.Ryan Reynolds is brilliant but the character and the writing is awful. Taiki Watiti is perfect but Antwon's dialog is terrible and his motivation is purely money.",Free Guy
1032,svedawilliam,Corporate garbage,2,3 October 2021,"You've seen this movie before. An NPC in a video games breaks out of his false reality. It's the matrix if some Disney executive saw ready player one and decided to make it as safe as possible. There is not a single unique aspect about this. It is VERY boring. Ryan Reynolds sucks and is only there for recognition. The only decent actors is Joe Keery and Taika Watiti. Because those are the only two actors that know that kind of movie they're in. There is no style and the CGI is horrendous. But hey, it's made money, so naturally Disney is going to buy it out and make a sequel.",Free Guy

This film was mostly carried by its actors, although all of the streamers and youtubers did their fair share (but most people won't know who these are). Unfortunately this title isn't magical or breathtaking but just a feel good film that drags on for a bit long, the action and adventure side is great but the overall plot needed polishing. You'll be laughing for half an hour and then looking at your watch the next, Overall I generously gave this film an 8/10 because it's funny, different, fairly relatable and fun.",Free Guy

It feels relatable to gamers as the main villain is a video game CEO who does not care and stifles developer ideas in order for profit, the references are not shoved down you throat like Space Jam A new Legacy, and overall, it just felt like a Hollywood movie portraying gamers done right. Sure the Youtuber references got a bit annoying but overall there was some heart written in this movie, and the main character was surprisingly funny even though I thought he would be a unfunny dumb character that tries too hard.

It felt like the writers thought they could write cringe dialog and expect Ryan Reynolds to just make it work, because he's Ryan Reynolds.Most of the characters are really unlikable. Ryan's character is written to behave like a 4 year old. Don't even get me started on Taika's character because oh man that was just not good at all. I will say I liked Buddy.This movie feels like it should of released back in 2010. You get a lot of old video game lingo like noob and trolls. You also get the occasional T Bag .It's apparent that the writers don't know anything about video games. Gamers are also portrayed to be fat losers living in their mothers basement. Except for the cameos. Yes, they show a lot of Twitch and YouTube streamers and at first its like ok that's cool but they keep showing them over and over again.Overall, I feel I might be getting too old for movies like this.

1050,gastonregatense,A love letter dedicated to nerds.,8,8 September 2021,"Ryan Reynolds, what a charismatically absurd man. With such a funny humor that it is impossible not to be entertaining.Directed and produced by the ""Deadpool"" actor, Free Guy is an ode to pop culture, and especially video game culture. With multiple references, immersed in an environment worthy of a Rockstar Games creation, the film is a crack from beginning to end.The plot, although somewhat mundane, unfolds in a linear and easy-to-follow manner. The idea of the manager of a large corporation nurturing and seizing on original ideas may sound appealing at first (since the concept is!), but it branches off into a very idealistic and plot-friendly conclusion.Still, this is irrelevant. Free Guy is intended to be an entertaining and amazingly bizarre movie. Not only is it a hilarious film, structured around an inventive script, but the meaning of its premise also mirrors today's video game culture. It achieves a plausible parallel between the draining nature of video games, these being a withering addiction that takes us away from real life and blinds us at times. Molotov Girl is the character that best reflects this statement.What stands out about Free Guy is that it does not seek to be funny, it does not force humor, it´s genuinely funny. This is largely due to the excellent work of a magnanimous and professional cast. All the performances feel well elaborated.The artistic freedom that characterized the production of this film is something that we viewers appreciate. It is a film that was thoughtfully made and with great attention to detail. Furthermore, in a world where Copyright Laws are so strict, the amalgamation of franchises and their articulation in the world of Free Guy is the realization of the dream of every little boy or girl who dimensioned all his favorite characters in the same scenario all at once.Free Guy is a movie to have fun and not think about it so much. Even more so if you occasionally enjoy consuming what the internet has to offer. However, no superior knowledge of anything is required. It is true that if you are a geek like me, the movie will feel much funnier. However, it stands on its own ground and all the meme-like knowledge beforehand is not so fundamental.",Free Guy
1051,dominikonlinekonto,Wannabe funny movie for rather uneducated people,3,30 October 2021,"Not a new Truman show, not a new ready player one, rather a wannabe funny comedy for rather uneducated people.The idea is promising and in the beginning it's fun to watch it but it gets boring and the comedy is disappointing.",Free Guy
1052,rojrung,Need better story,4,23 September 2021,"Ryan Reynolds can carry this movie for sure. But please make us better story bring us more emotional. A lot of things don't need in this movie Do you want to see jumping shoe or chasing by 5 star police? Do you want to see Antwan keep restarting server or get in to this game to control himself? Things just add up with no support to story at all. For example when director want lightsaber it just happened to be there no story. He need level up here we go. Why don't you buit up something for results that audiences waiting for? Like this light saber is the hidden legendary item no one could have it something meaningful. No Nothing we can looking forward to see. Do we exciting to see that hidden island? They try so hard to make you feel that island is important but No! It actually pretty boring what in real life cheering for npc to get to island you don't even know what's going on. If you want to copy Trueman to put in GTA game you must learn the good thing like how to get audience emotional through story through the level through the items he get. Something we looking forward to see in the end like Trueman show. When Guy know that he is npc, it's not built up emotional, it just happened because Millie tell him. Every thing that moving plot have no build up emotion or story or what so ever. We only enjoy through jokes that ryan reynolds speak. Imagine Guy is the one who seeking for clue keep level up from time to time not just 1mins from 1-100 with no meaningful, Trueman getting more clue like level up and in the end he could find himself. But in the end of this movie what will Guy do now? Because all that matters to him from the beginning is Millie and you end it up just like ""DO WHAT EVER WE WANT!"" But does he have anything he want now? And what benefits for Millie and Keys? No player in this new game now so no money. Do they need to mantain this server forever for npc? Please please please don't you just make a movie because you need to but wants audiences to enjoy all the story through the end that how the film work.",Free Guy

It has a mix of humor, action, a solid well written story line overall, and a bit of romance. I guess this Movie is not directed to boomers,more to people who have played open world video games.One of the most underrated movies by far in my opinion, it just honestly was the best movie I have ever seen.

No politics nothing, just fun!I wanted to give it an 8/10 but the only reason I didn't was the streamers they have shown like Ninja and Poki... I never watch twitch and never respect people like these. To put them in a movie makes the movie dirty and hard to watch in my opinion. They were totally unnecessary. They wanted to target 13Years old children with that move. But not only children are gamers sadly. The writer should've known better but I guess they know and just want money.All in all still enjoyable if you would ignore these scenes. There could easily be another cut without them ;-)",Free Guy

That just leaves the CGI action and it just didn't do enough for me.

1070,loqjaw,Finally a fun family friendly film in Free Guy,8,16 October 2021,"Whenever I see something promoted as a family friendly film, I worry. Because when I was growing up in the 80s and 90s this meant classics like Jumanji or Honey I Shrunk the Kids. Films that weren't just aimed at children, but the whole family. Hence the tag. But these days it's generally meaning a kids' film. The same way Doctor Who has gone from a family show to a kids' show.I shouldn't have worried at all with this one.Without giving any spoilers that aren't in the trailer, Free Guy is a Truman Show inspired story of an NPC in a video game slowly learning this fact. With big dollops of Groundhog Day, They Live and a few gracefully done video game references (they could have been gratuitous with this but they were very restrained), this film was very brilliantly made.Reynolds and Comer have absolutely great chemistry and are both playing the roles exactly as you'd expect (Reynolds being...well himself really, and Comer being that cool and distant but also loveable badass she already gave us in spades in Killing Eve.Obviously this is nowhere near flawless, and has its faults. But none of them were enough to keep me from thoroughly enjoying myself, and this was the most fun I've had watching a film for a long time.Highly recommended.",Free Guy

1077,lukertron,Its actually a chick-flick,6,2 October 2021,"I was surprised when I saw this, its actually a chick flick disguised as a sci-fi action flick. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie, just not as much as I was expecting to and that stems from a few dodgy full blown chick-flick music moments that I felt were really aiming more at a teenage girl. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I just wasn't expecting it, and it wasn't really my thing, so it lowered my score. Ryan Reynolds does his best Ryan Reynolds/Deadpool impression, and he does it well so i cant have a dig that much about that. I was also hoping for more video game references, I noticed a few like the Halo tank, but it wasn't as full blown as the ready player ones film references filling the screen (and that's not necessarily a bad thing since that became the only good thing about that movie) but i was expecting a few more, and the Disney sponsored film reference scene felt more like a Disney advert than a creative choice. Overall it wasn't a terrible film, but certainly not a classic either, it sits somewhere in the middle for me.",Free Guy

Only a few will not understand some of the references that are peppered throughout the film, and even those people will have plenty to enjoy throughout the whole experience regardless. Ryan Reynolds puts on a terrific performance as an NPC (""Non-Player Character"" -for the uninitiated, a background character in a game) that becomes self aware. The premise seems a little odd at first, but the story progression ties it all together well.The movie itself tugs the heartstrings in a way similar to Wreck-It Ralph and adds an amount of action the likes of which would make both Michael Bay *and* the Wachowski siblings blush. Cameos and pop-cultural references keep the movie fun and the romantic angles of the story are strong without being the main focal point.This is exactly the kind of feel-good movie we all need in this time of COVID, and I guarantee after a while of watching this movie you'll be surprised at how much you're smiling.",Free Guy

Free Guy seperates itself from most artifical intelligence movies by casting AI in a positive light instead of preying on humanity's fear of the unknown.The overall story, casting, and acting for this movie were phenomenal and I felt Ryan Reynolds has one again done a outstanding job in an unusual role. I do wonder with huge youtubers and streamers including JackSepticeye playing themselves how well the movie will age.The only two things I wish had been changed is there were unfortunately some political undertones which did not serve any real purpose in the movie and I feel Guy did not have as happy of an ending as he could have had as despite having his friends he still pushed away the girl he loves as he wants her to live her life.

1113,adrianpaulchardona,"Good, but disappointing too",7,18 August 2021,"I really hoped I'd be giving this movie a 9/10, but in all honesty I can not. I do accept that watching too many previews of it spoilt nearly all the elements of surprise (not that a lot of it wasn't predictable anyway). For me, the movie needed to 1 1/2 to twice as long. It sped through most scenes like the cutting-room editor hadn't checked who things looked in real time. What annoyed me most were the scenes and banter that were shown in the previews, but not also included the actual final edit of the movie. What struck me most was the long-distance view of Comer's ""lifetime of virginity"" conversation with Ryan, when the close-up of this in one of the previews was perfection. Whoever decided to do that has no idea about audience empathy and laughter. Anyway, I found it watchable to very good in parts, but mostly meh (in other words, I knew this movie couldn't been far better for the most part).",Free Guy

There are various times where it seemed that the writer's have never played a video game before, and there is multiple ""fellow kids"" moments. The word ""troll"" is used multiple times, but the writer's don't seem to actually know what that words means as indicated by how it is used. There are some enjoyable moments, and the movie is decently entertaining. However, there are also various moments that were pretty annoying.

Free City is the perfect type of GTA idea of a video game and the it turns into a life simulator like the sims for some reason that felt ok for the story.

Ryan Reynolds is, as always, anarchically brilliant, playing the role of both Guy and ""The Dude"" - the one with the slightly unformed catchphrase. Both Reynolds and actor/director Taika Waititi, who plays the flamboyant mega-games-mogul Antoine - are well known for their improv lines. And this is on show here in spades (for better and in some cases for worse). The Bluray extras on this one are sure to be a smorgasbord of different variants!Jodie Comer. Wow! The ""Killing Eve"" star had a cameo as Rey's mother in ""Star Wars - The Rise of Skywalker"" and starred in 2017's Morrissey biopic ""England is Mine"". But she's been TV's hidden gem in the main. This will surely be a break-out movie for her, since she is in a class of her own here. Her portrayal of the flashback teenage version of herself is brilliantly nuanced and believable. I know she's a serious actress, but the end of the movie made me think that there's a strong niche, alongside the likes of Rachel McAdams and Emilia Clarke, in delivering a top-class romcom in the future.

1179,stefanods-77730,"A Great Idea, but Immaturely Ruined.",5,28 August 2021,"I didn't have great expectations where I first saw Free Guy. But since I liked Ready Player One, I thought I'd give a try to this one. Eventually, I was quite disappointed. Here's why:The movie exploits this idea that NPC in videos games (non-playable characters) might, one day with the exact technology and coding configurations, be able to feel like a living human being. Become an artificial intelligence - which is a brilliant notion. Now, the way it was developed, written and sponsored, really made me uncomfortable and wanting me to stop watching the movie. The fact that this movie indulges these lazy, ignorant and useless content creators such as Ninja, Pokimain, DanTDM, and LazarBeam. I really didn't enjoy the fact that this movie promotes these people, who sits all day playing video games, streaming and doing nothing significant. These Youtubers indulge the new generation to play video games instead of studying and getting out of school not witless, but instructed instead. And what does Free Guy do? It promotes the idea of video games and streaming for a living, instead of berating it, like it should.Then, another reason why this movie didn't satisfy me, is because the acting of some pretty good actors such as Ryan Reynolds, Joe Keery, Taika Waititi, were really disappointing. They seemed childish and unmotivated to play the role given. For example, Taika really made me feel uncomfortable, as his acting was just dull and loomed unfinished. For the rest, it all seemed improvised, leading to fast paced actions and dialogues, leading to plot-holes and utter confusion. Improvisation can end up being a key tool in acting, but only if you know how to adapt it to the scene or the concept itself.The characters are, to the say least, basic. It's a video game, so the characters are no longer the special characters that remain stuck in your head for their charisma, like Darth Vader, Thanos or even Aang in Avatar. No, nowadays, we see characters like the ones in the movie pretty much everywhere and mainly on Video Games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA, and all other games that people stream today. So it wasn't as striking and original as Ready Player One, where there were at least customised characters like really looked amazing. But that won't matter to the people who only love video games and non-senseful action.Another point that made me really sceptical about how the story was written, is the way the ending unfolds. Basically, the ending was already spoiled towards the middle of the movie. As Keys, played by Joe Keery, literally says that he created this NPC, Guy, by integrating his own personality and sentiments for his coworker, Millie, played by Jodie Comer. So, from that moment, you understand why the NPC is in love with the female protagonist, AND you understand why it was created, as well and by who. Therefore, the ending is not surprising, not emotional, but spoiled and pretty much useless.These points are the main predicaments of this movie, there might be others, but these ones are the reason this idea of ""Free Guy"" (Free NPC) didn't come as striking as it could have been. It could have been a fantastic idea if the director, Shawn Levy, had the idea of inventing new video games, instead of promoting existing ones. We need to be original, not copy others. What's the point, then? Humans should evolve, no matter the domain. And today, cinema becomes predictable and pretty much a waste of money because a majority of modern movies don't reach much expectations anymore. It's always the same thing with movies like this one: a basic protagonist with a basic goal, a female character that creates drama within the story, a villain that steals glory greedily and craves power, a fight, a bigger fight, a small event of turning tables, another swing of the tables, a basic resolution, and then an happy, predictable ending.I sheerly hope that ideas like Free Guy will alter into something more impacting and less immature. It's a very intriguing concept, why ruin it with today's ruined generation? Why not send this movie into the future and use a future generation that is, somehow, better than ours. Or render the NPC aware of being a non playable character and slowly, making him want to be human like the ones playing around him, creating this notion that thinkable concepts can also crave free will. There are so many ways of making this idea of Free Guy a great notion and a great movie, but directors need to quit lazy writing.",Free Guy

I believe people tired of it. This movie will take you out of sad reality from the first second. Two hours of pleasure. Worth every penny.",Free Guy
1182,laughingtree,Good Summer Movie,7,22 September 2021,"I went into this movie not expecting much to be honest. The only reason I went to see it in theaters was because my wife loves Ryan Reynolds (for some reason). That being said, This movie is ACTUALLY DECENT. In a way, it's the perfect summer flick. It's a high energy, action/comedy with some elements of romance. No propaganda. No politics. I think the underlying message is more like: ""Be who you want to be, not who you think others want you to be"", which you can interpret how you like. Ryan Reynolds plays himself, and has typecast himself into the same character in every movie I've seen him in (except for the failed Amityville experiment...that'd be funny though). However, a lot of actors have made a killing doing this, and while it's not technically ""acting"", it is entertaining to a lot of people. Will Smith, Adam Sandler, Hugh Grant, and like every action hero come to mind. The point is, people keep accepting it and enjoying it so they keep churning out the movies.That is what this movie is. The plot was kind of interesting and the special effects were fun. Splicing the Mariah Carey song throughout this movie was one of the funniest parts to me. There is a critical junction where movies have to decide whether they are going to be for kids, teens or adults. Free Guy had all the makings of a kid movie that they tried to inject with some teen/adult jokes to keep the parents from snoring. All in all, I thought it was a surprisingly decent movie. It's not something I would want to watch again immediately, and there wasn't a ton of content to analyze...but it made us laugh several times and had a happy ending which is always nice. It's no Shrek, but it is probably the best family movie that's come out this year.",Free Guy
1183,cschultz-88922,all around good time,9,11 September 2021,"Hopefully the success of this movie will convince Hollywood that audiences want to be entertained instead of being lectured to. Please just let me get away from the messed up real world for two hours. Sure there were a couple of cringe woke one-liners; but that wasn't enough to ruin the entire movie. I was confused about the fake Kevin Hart; maybe the budget didn't allow for him. Taika Waititi was the weakest part of the movie; there's at least 10 better actors who could have played the villain better. Movie ran about 10 minutes longer than the 115 minute run time; so plan accordingly. Some cool Marvel cameos and Easter eggs; this movie is a good time worth seeing in the theater. As always Ryan Reynolds delivers, I want to punch his perfect teeth.",Free Guy

At the same time, however, he manages to serve a visually attractive event spiced with a tasteful and also cute romance. The ending is a bit overshot and at certain points it stops working logically (character behavior or technical possibilities of the program).

1190,nelupap,Meet John Doe a century later,10,9 October 2021,"I enjoyed a lot this movie, and will watch it again, hence my rating.Free guy is an NPC in some online game who grows self aware and realizes he's an NPC in an online game.Why did I like it so much? Guy is most of us, the 99.9 percent. The guys who get robbed by the tax man, who get shot by burglars, or worst, by the police, who get caught in the crossfire, if there is a war, who bag groceries, fill out forms, sell coffee, and wake up every day to the same soul sucking meaningless jobs, at which you have to dress the way the dress code says and end every interaction with the ubiquitous ""have a nice day"".Just like Guy's friends, most of us aren't aware, and don't understand what the 0.1 percent are, or why the are doing what they are doing, how they get away dodging taxes, robbing blind the working class or just crapping on our environment. All Guy's friends understand is that those sun glasses people are just untouchable.And while Guy's friends are just accepting of their status as underclass citizens, the 0.1 percent can't even imagine a world in which they aren't the predators and the slave masters.The movie is all about Guy's, or Guy's AI, waking up to the reality, and deciding to live as a Free Guy, in a world without never ending class warfare. In this particular movie, class warfare is just the rich messing with the poor, which is how it usually works. In that world, everyone is free to do as they want and be happy, which, the movie suggest, it should be possible in the real world too, if not for a bunch money grubbing jerks such as Antwan, the game company owner.The movie borrows a lot from other movies, such as The Matrix or Groundhog Day, but its message is quite clear: most of us, John Doe's, want just enough freedom to live happy lives. We don't care so much for ""missions"", for billions of dollars, world domination or control, but it would be cool if we could have enough peace and quiet to enjoy an afternoon stroll and ice cream with our girlfriends every now and then.There are some woke jokes in the movie, that some conservative people seem to dislike, but their effect on the quality of the movie is marginal. It kind of makes sense that a female star programmer would build a general purpose AI that learns from her to hate patriarchy, and I hope someone does it in real life. Until then, we are stuck with bank AIs that hate poor people, and Microsoft Office AI, that just hates everybody.The movie is very good in most departments:
story/plot: 7/10
message: 9/10
chemistry between actors: 10/10
acting: 9/10
special effects: 8/10

Or coding, or computers, or servers, or video game engines... i mean, this is at the very center of this story, and yet you got literally everything wrong about it.Yes, ok, the VFX were fine, even impressive at times, and Ryan Reynolds certainly does a good job at playing his favourite character - Ryan Reynolds, but come the fk on, why does the story have to be so mind-numbingly stupid?And the fact that the ratings of this movie are so high makes me wonder how far off are we from Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho running for the president.",Free Guy

It has a plot similar to some other films (Wreck-It Ralph and The Truman Show both come to mind), so it's not entirely original, but it's based on different media (a GTA-like MMORPG), so it's still unique.Reynolds is excellent as Guy, a loveable, naive NPC, and his performance is hilarious. His utter lack of understanding of Internet culture generated a lot of laughs in my theater.This is a great film for gamers, and it incorporates gaming culture without being overly stereotypical. There's the classic deadbeat gamer who lives with his mom, but there are also multiple girls shown playing the game and one of the film's stars is a female game designer.There's an amazing Marvel cameo near the end of the film. I won't spoil it, but it's a good one. Alex Trebek also makes his final appearance on screen.The only negative was Taika Waititi's Antoine. His character is supposed to be annoying, but his scenes are so over-the-top that they aren't fun to watch, and his one liners rarely earned as many laughs as any of the lines from the film's other characters. However, the rest of the film more than makes up for this.If you enjoy gaming and sci-fi and want a film that'll leave you feeling optimistic, this is the film for you.",Free Guy

It has barely any decent humor and borrowed what DNA it has from GTA Online and the Truman Show, but both of those media knew what they were selling while this is a confused mess. In fact; it kinda feels like two different movies smashed together.Its also filled with identity politics which are not funny so they don't belong in a comedy, you think teens wanna talk about the patriarchy and white privilege, of course not, your regressive ""woke"" brainwashing nonsense makes me wanna puke. I'm guessing the average person tunes those parts out because they don't even know what is being sold to them and they want to get back to Ryan Reynolds scenes.There are multiple scenes where the head of gaming company is taking an axe to his own computer servers rather then turning them off or just disabling the Blue Shirt Guy NPC or a million other things he could have done (when you have admin status you can do anything, like he could have removed Guy's eyes or swapped his skin/model/physics/collision or did something weird with his voice, heck he could have turned him into a level 1 ratty) that would actually make sense given the context, not to mention they keep saying the code was stolen yet earlier in the movie the guy corrected the girl and said it was paid for ... wtf is going on in this movie?

It would be a crime to audition anyone else and you could tell he enjoyed playing it. Great work too by Jodie Comer (""Millie"") - and Channing Tatum (""Revenjamin Buttons"") who literally made me laugh out loud which is no mean feat. Solid supporting cast too, although I could take-or-leave Taika Waititi despite appreciating his flair.The story itself is simply enjoyable; if you watched the trailer, leave your preconceptions at the door. Artificial intelligence and open-world gaming has the potential to snowball into a complex idea for some, but 'Free Guy' is neither obnoxious nor existential. It is pure colour, fast-paced, funny, creative, and (better yet) UNIQUE.The special effects are impressive; the soundtrack is uplifting, mainly thanks to a Mariah Carey classic; and I walked out the cinema with a smile on my face!

Tons of pop culture, meta-verse references, commentary videos from some Youtube/Twitch streamers doesn't make a ""fun"" element.Secondly; whoever wrote this script has no idea how games works or how is the infrastructure of MMO's works. There is no ""seperated servers"" that includes a character only or some place only like a "" park or building"".

It's pretty much a copy of Truman show but aimed at children and young teens, and trying so very hard to look cool to them. The writers used a lot of technical jargong but don't seem to know what it means. Sometimes it reminded me of the equally horrible movie project almanac where you had genius lines like: ""I can't get my UI's to interact."" ""Well, you have to put your level 2 cache in ad hoc mode""The premise doesn't make any sense either.

Not once do they go beyond this rating and the biggest problem is that they didn't even try.The person who edited the first trailer understood better how this universe should be or feel - the entire movie is in that trailer. Instead, Free Guy is all over the place.This movie is not about gaming (it's actually an insult to the gaming community and to the game devs), it's not about being free (it has maybe 3% vibe from The Truman Show, 0% from the Matrix or Ready Player One), it's not a love story or comedy, it's only a mess.The ideas were good but it seems they rushed everything. Such a great opportunity flushed in the toilet.Oh, but it has moments of pure wokeness cringe. White privilege, gay, trans, patriarchy, it's all there. This movie is only a demo for this messages to be displayed - or so it feels.In the end this is a popcorn movie if you let it be one.

1264,seekersbears,"Surprisingly Deep, Mostly Great Fun!",9,18 September 2021,"I walked in having no idea this was a 'video game movie', and was delighted as this concept became apparent within the first 10-15 minutes. It was also (and I'm surprised no one is talking about this) surprisingly deep for an action flick. Philosophical thinkers have asked questions throughout history that this movie asks its viewers-questions such as ""If we live in a simulation, is anything real?"" and ""Can artificial intelligence be alive?"" And the film provides genuinely heartwarming answers to these questions: ""Why does it matter? This moment is real."" ""Yes, anything that can change and grow can be considered as alive.""People keep saying it's a love letter to games, but it's also a love letter to creators. Imagine your creation telling you that they love you because you created them. I can't help but imagine all the authors, artists, coders, etc that would feel so touched by this powerful message.Aside from all that deep stuff, it was also just a fantastic action-comedy with great acting all-around.

If you think you'll like it, you will and vice versa. I saw this with my mom who loves these types of movies and her enjoyment made me have a better time with it.That being said, it's formulaic, confused about its message, and understands absolutely nothing about video games. Someone described this movie as made by a 60 year old who has seen their grand kid play GTA once, and I agree entirely. I obviously understand suspension of disbelief, but this movie took every chance it got to remind me that what's going on makes no sense.Mild Spoilers and Ranting below
Ok sure you have what's basically a GTA with everyone playing around the world on the same server. Whatever I'll pretend that can happen, but what exactly do you expect these thousands of players to be doing all the time? There is clearly only one set of NPCs (no alternate versions of them) because Guy experiences every bank robbery uniquely and sees the individual player doing it. This means that each sort of mini game can only be played one at a time. So if there's one city and let's be generous and say there's 50 unique things to do (bank robberies, heists, etc.) and 1000 people playing at a time (a lowball number considering the shown popularity of the game), what are 950 players doing?Ok, but let's suspend our disbelief there and say well players can run around doing whatever they want not just the mini games so they have something to do. 1000 people are running around crashing cars, killing NPCs, and destroying the city. But that's fine because everything will be reset back to normal, and it is as shown by the fact that Guy wakes up every day and things are fixed. Sure, except then a major plot point in the movie is that ""oh no we can let the server reset because then Guy will forget everything"". Umm excuse me what? You're telling me that a server with 1000 people on it at once causing chaos is not reset at least every 24 hrs? That doesn't make sense for any game irl and it doesn't even make sense in the movie's game because it's already shown the game get reset everyday when Guy wakes up!There are more problems with the game's logic, but these were the ones that took me out of the movie the most. There's a lot of cringe humor making fun of gamers as well, which is weird since it's marketed as a love letter to video games. Anyway, in conclusion, I don't care if you liked this movie. As I said, if you think you'll like it, you will, and there's nothing wrong with that. It just bothers me that so many people seem to find it accurate to video games when it doesn't make sense on even the most basic level.",Free Guy

I was a little surprised that I thought it would be full in the game world, and then there were a lot of easter eggs from certain characters/items from some famous games, but apparently not. Free Guy has many layers that make the story of a ""living"" NPC named Guy more complex.There is a conflict in the real world and there is also an inner conflict from Guy who is looking for his existence. I like how Guy's character is given a problem that the audience can relate to, that as human beings who are equipped with consciousness, it is our right to determine our own lives. Guy was translated well by Ryan Reynolds. He is easy to like and easy for the audience to sympathize with.The visuals are clearly full of the screen and lots of colors like in a game. The action is also the same, there are many transitions, like when you take out a weapon that feels like a game.

1334,nickmead-04212,Only as deep as the straight to DVD synopsis,6,11 October 2021,"While I held out hope that this movie would turn out to be a gem, its unfortunately full of lazy clichés and tropes - with its only redeeming quality being the acting...with exception of normally great Taika Waititi, who's typically flawless charisma couldn't save his 1 dimensional cringe worthy corporations are evil character. Ryan Renyolds, Jodie Corner and supporting cast, on the other hand, feel right at home.The story is mostly run of the mil, and the handful of times it approaches something interesting or fresh it quickly back pedals and returns to the mundane.It feels like a script written by someone trying to cash in on gamers who complain about constant sequels and no new IPs while being that exact thing: a movie retelling the same story seen a hundred times before but with a fresh, shiny coat of CG paint aimed at gamers, complete with Twitch cameos, to try and appeal to a profitable audience.It also feels like the writers don't understand how games work, let alone the physical technology. Without spoiling anything, I realise it's a movie so stakes need to be raised - but when so many problems have simple solutions the movie itself skirts around, it's just painful to watch.There are a handful of genuine fun and funny moments in the movie too, so its hardly all bad - but ultimately if the movie flew under your radar, I wouldn't try chasing it down.",Free Guy

There's funny moments, the plot is actually entertaining and somewhat well crafted (a few major plotholes and fairly predictable, but it's a family movie what do you expect) The casting was done well. This was my first movie with Jodie Corner and she was fun to watch. Joe Keery and Ryan Reynolds never disappoint. Never would of expected the director of Thor Ragnarok to be in a movie like this, but he did great. Diversity is something most movies and Hollywood as a whole do horribly wrong, but this movie did is so well. It wasn't in your face or overly obvious that they had x amount of people that were a certain race or the usual slew of ""politically correct"" stuff. It was simply there. There were characters of various races and that was it. As it should be. Anything beyond that is going against diversity's potential to be great.",Free Guy

1356,klnayloruk,Can a lowly NPC change a game from the inside? And can a NPC change the world on the outside?,10,12 August 2021,"In this PG-13 rated Action/Comedy/Sci-fi Shawn Levy (The Internship, Stranger Things) directed and Matt Leiberman (The Adams Family, Scoob!) and Zak Penn (The Avengers, Ready Player One) written film, Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool, The Proposal) is Guy the bank teller who discovers he's actually an NPC inside a brutal, open world video game.Guy has pretty normal days. He gets up to his alarm, says hello to Goldie his goldfish, eats breakfast whilst watching the violence-themed tv news, then walks to his job at the bank, stopping off to buy his usual coffee, then meets up with best friend bank security guard Buddy (Lil Rel Howery: Get Out, Tag) where bank heists are an every day occurence.So much so, that he and Buddy usually plan their day whilst lying on the floor surrounded by breaking glass. Sometimes Guy talks about meeting the girl of his dreams. And she is a dream, until one day he sees her walking on the street. Enter Molotov Girl AKA Millie (Jodie Comer: Killing Eve, Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker) who is searching the game for the missing code that she and fellow games designer Keys (Joe Keery: Stranger Things, After Everything) wrote which she believes was stolen by billionaire games designer Antoine (Taika Waititi: JoJo Rabbit, Thor: Ragnarok) and hidden in the game.Guy falls instantly in love and feels he must get to know the girl of his dreams. But Millie will only talk to Guy if he levels up. Can a lowly NPC change a game from the inside? And can a NPC change the world on the outside?My husband and I were looking forward to going back to the cinema for the first time in what felt like forever and we absolutely loved this film. We don't think it was just the excitement of returning to the full cinematic experience but the movie itself. With an original take on the AI premise and great acting across the board (trust me, I feel nobody but Ryan Reynolds could nail the part of Guy so well, I adore Jodie Comer in everything I have seen her in, and Taika Waititi's villian was inspired), this film was the perfect start to getting back to normal film viewing. I'm so pleased it was pushed back to ensure cinematic release as it adds to the 'in the game' feel.We laughed, I cried and and we shared some knowing looks at some of the references (which I won't share here because I want this review to be spoiler free so you can go and watch the movie and be blown away by them yourself).Even though a lot of the actors were playing NPCs there was joy in them discovering new things that are normal every day things to us (which felt very poignant to how we all seem to be feeling in this post-pandemic world), so there was a point in the film when I wanted Keys worker friend Mouser (Utkarsh Ambudkar: Brittany Runs A Marathon, Blindspotting) to stop blindly following the orders of the boss and try to see what was really happening. Especially as it begins to be at the expence of his supposed 'friend' and work colleague. Then I realised, was this a mirror to show how we humans can be NPCs in our own lives sometimes and that we should all wake up and see how the world really is? That we could go out and make the world we want for ourselves. Maybe.This film is fantastic feel good gaming action from start to finish, with brilliant little touches that the gaming community, film franchise fans and others will pick up on, plus a scattering of hilarious cameos. Packed with humour and a message that seems particuarly relevant in the current climate, I recommend going to see it as soon as you can.Trust me, I will be going again.",Free Guy

and it made it even better.Also, the actor who plays Steve Harrington from Stranger Things is in this movie, and he does a very good job.I can't tell you about it, but I nearly cried at the last 20 minutes of the film.Overall, Free Guy is an unforgettable comedy spectacular starring one of the funniest people in the world.If you are a parent who has kids who play video-games, they'll love this.

Dont think anyone will be disappointed by the story line or acting although the ending was a little predictable and underwhelming but watchable. To be honest I would have rated it much higher if it wasnt for the fact that there were constant references to young game players talking about how hot ryan reynolds is and its really hard to shake how big an age gap there is between ryan reynolds who in more recent years has embraced films more suited to his age range and jodie comers character. If anything it just kind of adds an ick factor watching it just my opinion.

Nothing makes sense :every time the ''game'' people are playing is shown IRL it looks like a cut scene, like they just took the image we were seeing previously and just changed the image quality, how are they even playing it? What is the camera logic?people are watching things happen live but you don't really know who or how it is broadcasteda lot of plot holes present, like when Molotov Girl (Jodie Comer) kisses him at the end but Keys (Joe Keery) clearly states earlier in the film that there is no button or option for thatthe fact that Molotov Girl (Jodie Comer) keeps finding Guy (Ryan Reynolds) with ease when she wants to talk to him etc, like how? He's an AI, has no tracker on him, you can't see where he is or what he is doingalso he's doing all this stuff but how does he behave in the other 5000 servers? He's just this banker in the 4999 left and this mentally developing AI in that 1 server?I won't be able to tell you everything wrong with this film but one thing is certain, the script wasn't written by someone who knows video games or the world of tech very well...

Some of the jokes hit so badly I could feel the tension in the theatre as all of us awkwardly cringed out of embarrassment. Ryan Reynolds was a gem as usual, but I can't help and have a weird inkling in the back of my head that someone else could have fit the role as Guy better. Worth watching, great concept to see explored, just think it missed the mark a little.",Free Guy

I have had this movie pinned on my to watch list for a very long time now and I'm thankful I did and I was blown away by how different it was than I expected. I figured this was going to just be a film carried by Ryan Reynolds but the overall concept was reasonably well thought out and far more grounded than at first glance. Don't get me wrong, this is not on par with the likes of the first Pirates of the Caribbean film where it can be widely praised as one of the best but for what I wanted from the film vs what I got I am blown away. Very funny, great actor chemistry, decent premise, amazing cameos, Ryan Reynolds. What more could you want?",Free Guy

1410,realthtcituba,Great Movie !,8,5 September 2021,I love this movie. It's similar to Ready Player One. I hope there will be more that kind of scenarios. I love questioning main characters.

1412,ghbryans,"A lot of fun, Reynolds carries it, a couple of SJW moments",7,25 September 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's largely well-written, though there's a rather abrupt transition when the main character is told he's not real, and accepts it without a whole lot of questioning.They could've ditched some of the needlessly long fight time and given the character more time to reflect. Also, anyone who understands computers and code if going to laugh a lot at some of the premises.Ryan Reynolds is, well... He's a star. One of those actors that you just enjoy watching. He carries this movie.I could've done without the offhand reference to white privilege (I don't like being insulted during my entertainment), and the intimation that a sign of the development of intelligence is getting involved in gender studies. But that's Hollywood these days and for today's fare, the SJW was minimal.All in all, pretty decent fun with a nice, sweet ending. I'm pretty sure most viewers will enjoy it.",Free Guy

''Free Guy'' is unique as an action-comedy, yet, amazing thruway of its depth - exploring love, interpersonal connection, betrayal, and courage. With a unique hand, regular Ryan Reynolds and this world do a top-notch job conserving entertainment throughout. As a love story, gaming tribute, comedy, action ""Free Guy"" is a vivid and colourful, action-packed family film with unique laughs and even a couple of shocking cameos that will make you smile. ""Free Guy"" is a love letter to the gaming world that delights in its wackiness.

1435,nimaperera,Marking the death of 21 century fox,1,2 October 2021,This film shows us how is disney making hollywood into hollowwood. It is sucking up the diversity of hollywood and making no brainer films such as this. If this continues everyone would make disney like no brainer films because they want profit and it will become trend that will eventually make hollywood movies unwatchable. This has happened film industry in my country. Disney movies are an eye pleaser that lacks quality and art. This also shows us a error in the hollywood(quality over quantity). Im shocked to see none complaing about this monopoly acting of disney. The rise of disney also shows us how people(we) are addicted to fantasy and some people taking advantage of it. Though the above text convey that im a disney hater i kind of like to watch disney movies(marvel etc). But the thing is these kind of like movies(that does need only eyes to watch without a brain) should be genre not a studio that devours other studios that make different works. As i see it movies is an art that should inspire reality and provoke the society to go forward. As i see it the box office has become a platform that distributes mediocre films to underdeveloped countries and make the future generation linger in a fantasy that is far fetched from reality and live in a princess like world that shows like everything in world is equal and and in life there is always a happy ending. The best example for this is in the inception film where poor people live in dream world fantasy to escape reality. Though it seems that world is in peace every country every person is trying to stand upon other to forever going mirage of power gain. Finally😧filmmakers and studios need to understand there are people who admire deep level films too😉 thanks for those who read this far😍,Free Guy

This is a triumph of modern cinema,10,2 October 2021,"As a world renowned photographer, I can assure you first and foremost that all the shots within this film were superbly shot. It almost felt as if you were transported there yourself and could reach out to touch Ryan Reynolds at any moment. The plot itself was a masterpiece that after having experienced made me disgusted with all previous films such as Godfather or the Lord of the Ring trilogy for daring to attempt to come close to the brilliance of this story telling. Nearly every component of this movie fits together like a jigsaw puzzle to create the ultimate cinema sensation for any and all viewers. The only possible nitpick I could provide for this achievement of humanity is not having Ryan Reynolds hold me in his strong arms and thank me for watching his film before telling me of all the benefits I could receive from switching to Mint Mobile. This will no doubt become a family film classic that will be watched multiple times throughout a year for the ages to come so do yourself a favor and enjoy the sensation sweeping every nation that is Free Guy. -Fedzor.",Free Guy

1445,yoshiwot-91041,"A well shot, polished...meh?",5,4 October 2021,"Free Guy takes an idea that's been floating around the internet for a while now (NPC becomes self aware) and weaves that core thought in to a overarching story of the question of sentience and non violence as a viable alternative to the usual chaotic gameplay gamers are used to. That's the most charitable I can be towards this movie.However, there's some serious flaws. Not least of which for me is that the ""game"" world just didn't feel like a game. It's not something I've seen brought up in many other reviews but it really bothered me how unrealistic (admittedly the tech in the game is verging on sci-fi) the game world appeared. The best example of this is when a character is crying in real life and their avatar in the game has a tear rolling down their eye.A more traditional criticism is that for a comedy I do not find this movie funny. Pretty big issue right there even if there were a couple of points that did cause a small chuckle. Overall the comedy is one note, the script not tightly written and the slapstick wears thin pretty quickly. Sure Ryan Reynolds is likeable as always but at this point can we just admit he's coasting?Plot wise Free Guy is, fine. A relatively interesting if not fully fleshed out ""real life"" arc keeps the movie chugging along supported by a good supporting cast. People seem to criticize the film for Taika Watiti's character being annoying and while I agree he was, that's kinda the point so no thumbs down for me there. The special effects are great too and there's some interesting cinematography thrown in out of nowhere so props for that.Overall Free Guy is exactly what it's advertised to be. A fun Ryan Reynolds movie with action and humour, but the humour won't win everyone over and beneath a glossy exterior is a film which lacks substance.",Free Guy

While Waititi wasn't my favourite performance, he certainly delivered on the ""maniacal power hungry boss"" stereotype, but needless to say he got annoying at times.

Watch this for it is by far one of the weirdest things we have seen the past years.

I love Jack Septiceye, Pokimane, Taika Waititi (and Deadpool). I'm a casual gamer and full-on nerd. But this movie was trash. From jokes about people with intellectual disabilities to jokes about incels and dudes living in their mom's basements, this felt like it was written by a Boomer. Totally out of touch with the modern gaming community. Cliche, Hollywood movie where hot nerd guy winds up with hot nerd girl. It dragged on FOREVER. All three of us were bored.

The script is a pleasant surprise, I wondered from the trailers how far they could take the ""background character becoming self-aware"" one-trick poney without becoming redundant or boring, and they did a terrific job.It's not too much action, it's not too much romance, just the right amount to make you feel for the characters for 2 hours. Is it one of the greatest movies of all time? Hell no. Is it entertaining?

Ryan Reynolds was in his usual form and while the movie wasn't entirely original it was entertaining fare. Then the Hollywood identity politics began creeping into the dialogue. Initially it was white privilege which at first I mistook for a bit of subtle humor but when other ""messages"" within the dialogue began to appear that was enough for me.Comedy and light hearted fantasy don't really mix well with the identity politics claptrap coming out of Hollywood. Whatever happened to a movie just focusing on being entertaining? Disappointing.",Free Guy

Ryan Reynolds is in full pop culture Deadpool mode showcasing the humour that has made him so big right now.Jodie Comer and Joe Keery play their parts well as does most of the supporting cast. The only let down for me was Taika Waititi. His oddball cringe humour is very 50/50 at the start of the film but is just tiresome by the end.There is plenty on offer for adults to enjoy and a few cameos that the YouTube generation will either smile or cringe at (I was the latter), but overall it was just fun.The trailer sets the tone well so it's very much a ""get what you see"" scenario but if you want to kill a few hours they are worse films this summer.Overall, fun but not great but by no means worth missing out.",Free Guy

This one was different. Free Guy was good, but my wife and I both came away with a ""eh"" opinion of it. It definitely had a few laugh out loud moments, but overall it was far more flat and predictable than I thought it would be after all the fantastic reviews. I do agree with those who have mentioned the chemistry between the three leading stars--they all did a great job. It's just that the story was less funny/entertaining on the whole than I thought it would be. Some reliance on juvenile/crude humor really didn't elevate the fun factor for us and was unnecessary.

Totally legally. Yeah. Just like I'll do with all this woke Hollywood crap. It's not even worth the bandwidth really. I'll be going the the theater to see the next Bond film though.

1501,alessandropereirapla,An amazing experience!,10,18 October 2021,"Why everyone should watch ""FREE GUY""Do you know when a person starts watching a movie without expecting much from it, guessing it would be just another one of those Hollywood canned goods and ends up being totally surprised? This movie has the power for much more than that, it leaves the person with a feeling of an explosion of beautiful and positive emotions in the chest, with wet eyes and with a lighter soul. With renewed faith in life and hope.I know some would say ""ahhh, you're just saying that because the movie takes place in a virtual world of video games and that's a topic you're interested in."" No. It's much more than that. The fact that the story is set in a digital video game world only serves as a background and perhaps also helps to attract the attention of these younger generations, which is a good thing, as none other than this new kid NEEDS this message.These filmmakers managed to concentrate in this film the powerful messages packaged before in classics like ""Blade Runner"", ""The Matrix"", ""They Live"", ""Germinal"" and also with the best of the romantic comedies of the last 30 years. Is that enough?The film faces the metaphysics of existence, the why we all exist, the fatigue of everyday routine and its apparent lack of purpose, aspects that are present in a pre-established stablishment imposed by institutions given to each one of us as absolute and unquestionable. Just for this questioning, the film would have won me over. But it doesn't stop there, it also lifts the hood lid and shows all the workings of the ""engine"" in the world, allowing each one to be recognize itself as part of the machine's mechanism. And it ends up revealing that, just as light comes from a single focal point, so the wonder of knowing this reality converges with the full realization of love and sincere friendship.Watching this film with an open heart and mind leads the subject to contemplate the mysteries of the meaning of life, the meaning of existence, without pointing out a simple answer (because there is no such answer), but just drawing a huge arrow that shows the way. And this arrow points in a direction that the heart of each person will know that it is the right path, and that it is only by walking along this path that everything will work out in the end. And it will be amazing.And the better part is that the construction of this powerful message is done in such a light, and beautiful way, that when you reach the end of the road, there is nothing left but this amazing feeling of greatness, a fireworks display of beauty, sweetness and accomplishment.Everyone should watch ""Free Guy"". Do not deprive yourself of this experience.And perhaps we meet in ""Free Life"" someday...",Free Guy

All that hashed with the now-boring Reynolds routine and excessively predictable plot makes this barely a 2/10 (there are 3-5 genuinely funny bits that last seconds).I understand the video game world part had to be pre-packaged and served up for an average moviegoer-type to understand, so not even going to touch that subject.",Free Guy

1) how attractive and addictive imaginary worlds are
2) how most of the players are dumb and aggressive and trolls
3) how greedy are game publishersAbout main topics:
About PCs killing and messing with NPCs - I think such brutality with respect to NPCs appeared in Carmageddon series firstly. Honestly, it might be a good thing that some people can be aggressive ingame letting steam out. So that they can be better IRL.About AI - they have played it cool. But personally I prefer Japanese approach to it (Summer Wars, SWO).But, Ryan Reynolds? Really? He plays the same character for quite some time already. And you know what he would do. Is it just lazy director and producers? ""We need to find a guy who is funny and can do action"" - ""Ryan Reynolds""

Like ready player one, they did it so well, how can the PC ""feel"" things in the game through a keyboard and mouse? Like how did she feel a gun through his pocket with the keyboard?? VR could have easily fixed this.2. Is it a single player game or a multiplayer game? If it's a multiplayer why are there savefiles? How does guy follow her through the save files? This would have been fixed by just sticking to it being a multiplayer and when she loads in she can pick locations and not save files3. ""god mode"" involves coding stuff into existence on the spot? Come on, in reality they just fly and become invincibleI could go on, and i know this is a comedy movie but why is that an excuse? This is a 100 million budget movie, that involved so many people, they didn't have a single person to tell them about these easily fixable mistakes?

I was the first one out and while I waited for my husband I was able to see people come out. Everyone was smiling and as the world is living through (insert all the different things the world is different from 2010) it was so great to see this occur IRL. Now on to the movie, the one liners were not over the top nor redundant. Guardians of the galaxy 2 are an example of over the top one liners. When over used they lose that zinger appeal. This movie was creative and if you have a gamer in your life or play video games this will be so relatable. I am not sure if you do not play video games the appeal will be the same - boomers. Being Gen X, I am able to enjoy given my husband is a total gamer. THE END.",Free Guy

We only get 1 day to set the scene before we jump right into the story, then no matter what he always seems to be able to find that girl with no issue whatsoever. Also how the heck does he know how to do all this fighting? They never explain that in this stupid movie.The acting and chemistry was forced, the DUDE was so cringy I almost just left, everything was a nightmare.Also like all the NPCS are completely shocked and horrified he wants a cappuccino, but then in the end it takes hey listen to me after 1 day of being reset and they're all like yeahhhh let's go fight!!!

Ryan Reynolds playing his classic role again. Action scenes kinda reminding Matrix. Also the general idea used in Truman Show before. The down side of the movie is it ignores movies real world kinda too much.

1557,guitarblackbear,Way better than my expectation!,10,31 August 2021,"I'd seen this movie 6th times. That's how much I love this movie.The reason I love this movie is because of the overall score and the chemistry between characters.First, Christophe Beck remake the epic paperman soundtrack in the kiss scene twice which stuck with me for the longest time and makes me want to see this sweet scene over and over again in the theater.Second, the chemistry between Milles and Guy reminds me of the old days when people playing online games and really want to have solid relationships with others. It did bring the nostalgia to the people who had this kind of experiences.Third, I love the setting for Jodie Comer. She can be two personalities within the movie. One is the smoking-hot stone-cold killer named ""Molotov Girl"" in the virtual world and the other is a computer nerd in the real world! The acting when Keys told her that Guy was a NPC after the terrific kiss really got me.In conclusion, the movie has a very smooth plot, lots of satisfying special effects, a great cast and wonderful music. It is not only a great popcorn movie but also you can find something in your heart after seeing this movie.I was so upset that I missed the IMAX screening and didn't get the poster.If you haven't seen it, give it a try.

For example, the scene where Guy had his first kissThe villain portrayed by Waititi was also characterised poorly as he is merely an authoritative antagonist with no charisma, which makes the movie seem like a child play. Yet, Waititi has portrayed his character well.As for the storyline, the director does not explore more on the relationship between the game creator and the girl, making the ending confusing as I have no idea how did the duo build up their sense of affection - the director should construct this in a more exquisite manner.In general, a movie that suits family and children with great CGI, yet a very mediocre commercial film - shouldn't have more expectations than that.",Free Guy

1568,carlos5577,Ready Player 2,2,18 August 2021,"Well... that was a story. Why is this becoming a trend in video game movies to hammer in messages that boomers always complain about video games. ""Why don't you go to r/outside and play with your friends"" - Ready player one. ""Why are video games so violent; you should play the game of life instead""SPOILERS! AHEAD
This movie had way more points to get across like big franchises are bad; big video game companies are bad; indie games are good; etc Obviously, this movie is based on GTA V Online. The story starts off with potential to tell a tale of an AI NPC (non-player character) becoming sentient. As he continues to become self-aware, he becomes a good guy and stops all the senseless killing of his brethren. What I hate right off the bat is that this is based on an open world game and none of the players are able to do ""any good"" themselves; its like they have to kill the NPCs, humiliate them, etc. What this movie ignores is that in open world games you are free to do whatever you want; you don't have to act like a dick all the time. Yeah, sure games like these are based on committing crimes, living the life of a criminal but it's not the only thing.So sure, you have your video game references like teabagging, twitch steamers, no lifers and basements which make for good jokes and that movie has some of that. This is the only high points for this movie which can be summed up by Ryan Reynolds and video game culture references.Now we have to go back to an agenda that this movie is trying to get across with its plot. Again, it involves video game company executives, franchises, and indie games. The video game industry does have problems which this movie tries to address by giving us an annoying CEO villain who just wants to steal some IP from our protagonists. It constantly tries to get point across that big game studios are bad money hungry companies (which is true I guess), originality is good (movies should take note) and that indie games are better (90% of them crap, just look at my steam library full of them unplayed). I wouldn't take issue with this if it wasn't for that constant hammering.Ok what about the romance? Wasn't that a big part of the movie? There's a better movie called ""Her"" when we are ready to give up on real life romance and just fall in love with an AI instead. It's not interesting and serves no purpose other than to connect our ""guy"" to the plot.Ok so what did guy do at the end? Idk he just found hidden code which proved evil company was evil but they kept all the profits but Konomi went bankrupt anyway because they were unoriginal.SPOILER! ENDSThe point is .... Yeah I don't know either, the movie is all over the place. I guess go play the game of life instead kid.",Free Guy

1577,kat-76005,Looking for a fun romp? This might be just what you're looking for in these trying times.,5,17 October 2021,"Title is sarcastic of course, but I have noticed from online discussion that a lot of peoples' experience was partially influenced because of the stressful state of the world right now and the amount of slowburn/serious films we've seen this year. I went into this mostly blind; I knew the IMDb synopsis but that's it. I wasn't expecting too much but didn't like it near as much as most for a few reasons. To be clear: this isn't a terrible movie imo. It has its charms and my ""mental removal"" from it were probably what held me back from enjoying it to the full extent as one could. There are some minor spoilers ahead but most is general.So, I'm not particularly knowledgeable about programming or video games (though I enjoy them), but there were several moments that made no sense and as such, would carry over into the next scene, one after another, in that I'd try to make sense of the prior scene when I could've been present for the scene playing out. I figured I was too dumb to get certain things and assumed they'd done their research, but it seems actual programmers and IT professionals had the same gripes I did. Regardless, it made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the ""exciting"" world they set up. I imagine they were counting on the general audience not thinking too hard about this aspect.Some of the dialogue was also... bad. Only in a couple scenes, and I think some of that can be attributed to poor direction or acting from some characters. At other times, it pandered or came off too on-the-nose. It also came off a bit tone-deaf as there's a theme of anti-capitalism and ""real heart"" being put into things, when the film itself is obviously piloted by huge corporations that have drawn criticism for their soul-less approach in recent years and it doesn't really go much deeper than that -- I don't think this type of movie needed to and I understand movies need funding, but it could've been executed better.There's also one character that changes motivations out of nowhere. Like, they spent the whole movie on one side, only to flip a switch. We don't see any growth and it makes you wonder why they're only now standing up when they seemed pretty unbothered throughout. I guess so the plot can continue?The plot itself is pretty predictable and trope-y. Some viewers will be reminded of other films and there are a lot of references and cameos. I wish there was a bit more of the fun stuff with Guy before diving straight in and dedicating most of the runtime to the central conflict with the real-world characters. Basically, the pacing could be improved a little imo BUT I know many will like the quick approach.There's an unintentionally hilarious scene where characters are staring/smiling at at each other and the camera keeps switching for a long time, and I thought they were setting up a joke as the rest of the film would leave you to believe, but I guess it was supposed to be a sweet Hollywood™ moment.As predicted, it has a shallow commentary on existentialism that I think was handled well enough for the type of movie it is.On a positive note, I liked the friendship between two characters a lot - it made for some funny moments and was very wholesome. Most movies focus on romance, which this does have, but the friendship is the one that I actually cared about. The acting was mostly quite good. You can also tell they tried to instil some sense of heart.. whether that succeeded will be subjective to the viewer.VERDICT: 5.8/10It's a fine movie. If you can turn your brain off for a while and just go along for the ride, it'll likely be a very fun time. For those well-versed in gaming, film buffs, and overly-analytical types, it might be hard to not notice its flaws. Ryan Reynolds carries the movie to the best of his abilities given the material, so if you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it. It teeters the ""fellow kids"" line sometimes but not nearly as bad as other similar movies. It's also guaranteed to be dated in a few years for several reasons.It got a few laughs from me but for this kind of film, enjoyment will depend on the individual and your brand of humour. Certain things might seem dumb or go over the heads of those who aren't part of the target demographic. I'd liken the experience to Jurassic World or the Jumanji reboot that seemingly divided audiences. Not every movie needs to be a masterpiece but it should still do its gimmick well. It falls short there at times but is otherwise perfectly watchable for a one-time deal to just feel good for a while.",Free Guy

1579,philip-cauwel,Gamers will love this one!,9,11 August 2021,"In Free Guy the story revolves around Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a Non-Playable Character (NPC) in a successful game called ""Free Town"". As NPC he is basically computer controlled, going through his daily routines, getting coffee, going to work at the bank, in an infinite timeloop. Meanwhile, all around him the gaming world is constantly being shaken up human player characters performing missions, gathering loot and levelling up. Enter player character Molotov Girl, or Millie in real life (Jodie Comer), who unknowingly triggers a process that will ""free"" Guy from his timeloop and sets him on the path for an exciting adventure.The movie pays tribute to a lot of classic predecessors: the ""Groundhog day"" timeloop, the ""Ready Player One"" or ""The Matrix"" virtual reality context, and of course countless movies about artificial intelligence (AI).The special effects are really superb. I had the luck to see the movie in 4DX and it really adds to the experience. There is always something happening in the ""Free Town"" world and the crashing helicopters, speeding cars, gunfire all look very neat.What really makes the movie shine are the same things that made ""Deadpool"" such a success: a Ryan Reynolds in top form, and a storyline with a hero who doesn't take himself too seriously.The ending is good also, gives some moral lessons, again without being too serious about it.Will this movie become an all-time classic?
