0,MartinHafer,a complete waste of a good book and good actors,1,5 July 2005,"When I first saw this movie in the theaters, I was appalled. The book DUNE had been one of my favorite sci-fi novels and I had very high hopes for the movie. Instead, I was shocked to see how utterly incoherent the story was (those who went with me needed me to explain what was happening over and over). I was also angry at the revolting images in the movie that are pure David Lynch (such as the slaves with their eyelids sewn shut, the closeups of the sore on the Baron's face and much more). Perhaps the worst travesty is the complete waste of talented actors such as Max Von Sydow, Patrick Stewart, Jose Ferrer and Dean Stockwell. None of them had much to do but stand around as the special effects whizzed by!In light of all these things and the lavish budget, I give this movie a score of ONE. Perhaps I might have treated the movie a lot better if there weren't so many reasons why it SHOULD have been so much better. I think given the money and acting talent, even Ed Wood, Jr. Could have come up with a better film! After all, DUNE was an amazing and intelligent book--this movie was just a self-indulgent mess and it totally ignored the terrific plot--focusing more on irrelevant details and disgusting images!!",Dune
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A failure, but a somewhat interesting one at that",4,2 December 2010,"Now I didn't think Dune was completely awful, but it is rather disappointing. That said, it is a somewhat interesting failure, not in how bad or good it is but what it could have been. Starting with the good things, the production values are superb and actually elevate the film. The costume and set design are spot on, while the special effects are stunning. While Max Von Sydow and Patrick Stewart are quite weird in their roles, they are weird in a good way as they are very enjoyable here. And Francesca Annis is gorgeous.However, everything else doesn't work. First off, I didn't think David Lynch was the right director for this. Don't get me wrong, I do like Lynch and his films especially The Elephant Man and Mulholland Drive. But when I think of Lynch, I think of haunting and surrealistic, not taking a mammoth book and condensing it into a three hour movie. Granted, I do not go against directors who do something different once in a while, but this didn't feel like Lynch. Speaking of the length, I think 3 hours is not enough to do justice to this wonderful book, it should have been at least a 5 or 6 hour mini-series, and the pacing is often stodgy. The script is awful mostly, often cheesy and dull and the story feels bloated and skimmed over, taking elements that were so good in the book and either poorly exploring them or leaving them out entirely. At times it wasn't very easy to follow either. The music score is mostly mediocre, while I was both surprised and disappointed at how much overacting there was, Von Sydow and Stewart aside. Kyle McLachlan is a bland lead, while the rest of the cast try to make amends for the script and fail spectacularly.All in all, a big disappointment and a (interesting) failure. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Dune
2,bkoganbing,Liked the universe of Star Wars a lot better,4,19 February 2019,"Dune can never and will never attain the popularity of Star Wars. It has however
attained a certain cult status with some most esoteric science fiction fans.As simply as I can put it there's some really good narcotic out on a desert planet
and the stuff is called Melange. It enhances your mind better than psychedelics
do and it can really make you travel by folding space. Imagine by bending the
fabric of the universe a bit you can wind up on a planet in the Andromeda galaxy.Powerful stuff, everybody wants it. And the Luke Skywalker of our story played by Kyle MacLachlan's is going to get it. He's got to fight some others
who have it and want it and some really nasty battleship size worms to do it.Speaking of those worms, couldn't imagine what in their desert environment
these babies could eat other than stray humanoids.Some massive special effects, a few good guest star turns from Jose Ferrer,
Patrick Stewart, Max Von Sydow, Virginia Madsen, Sting, and Linda Hunt.But it ain't the Star Wars cycle.",Dune
3,Leofwine_draca,Spacebound costume drama,4,4 September 2011,"Quite obviously made by Dino De Laurentiis as a film to cash-in on the newfound popularity of the science fiction genre thanks to George Lucas, DUNE is a film with epic intentions (and an epic running time). It's an adaptation of Frank Herbert's '60s sci-fi novel and watching it is a huge undertaking: you're drawn into a whole new mythological universe with its well established peoples, planets and nations, along with the divides, loyalties, heroes and villains that well-established fiction brings. It brought to mind seeing LORD OF THE RINGS for the first time in the sense that there's a great deal to take in (much more than in the comic-strip style STAR WARS).Watching this, it soon becomes that DUNE is needlessly complicated and better care needed to be taken in adapting a lengthy novel into a filmed version (even a film this long). There are so many characters vying for screen time that I struggled to make sense or indeed care about what I was seeing, and Kyle Maclachlan's young and upstarting hero is far too one-dimensional to be much interest. A lot of the early scenes are stagey and feel cod-Shakespearian; I'm sure they're integral to the storyline but I just found then dull beyond belief.It's not all bad. The storyline picks up as the film progresses, with the last hour a fairly exciting mix of action and suspense. David Lynch does the best he can with the material and adds some much-needed weirdness to the alien creations (also watch out for some early CGI, extremely crude by today's standards but a benchmark nonetheless). And what a cast! At least two dozen familiar actors from the era are present in myriad roles and it's a shame that none of them get much of a look in aside from Kenneth McMillan's grotesque villain.In the end, DUNE feels like an interesting failure: there are elements of intrigue, suspense and plotting that work, but in the end it proved too taxing for the masses and subsequently bombed at the box office. There's a ""why should we care?"" feel which marks the death knell of any movie.",Dune
4,SnoopyStyle,Too much too ambitious but what a lovely mess,6,22 September 2014,"It's the year 10,191. The universe is ruled by Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth. The most precious substance is the spice, melange which is used to extend life and fold space. It only exists on Arrakis also known as Dune where the local Fremen long for a prophesized messiah. The emperor plans to dethrone Duke Leto Atreides (Jürgen Prochnow) fearing his new weapon, the weirding module. First he allows the House Atreides to run the spice production. Then he supports the jealous House Harkonnen to invade and kill all the Atreides. There is something about Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) that concerns everybody. He and his mother Lady Jessica manage to escape the massacre. They find shelter with the Fremen as he falls in love with Chani (Sean Young).There is a dense introduction and lots of expositions. It is way too complicated for novices on the first try. I'm sure many people glazed over. The style is impressive. It has a great unique look. The production value is all there on the screen. The cast is also impressive with some strange outsider casting like Sting, a whole lot of experience, and some newcomers who would become big stars. They all work in their own way. David Lynch is definitely going all in with this movie. It has its Lynch weirdness but he holds it back enough to allow the story to make some sense. The weirdness sometimes works but sometimes pumps up the cheese factor. It just won't make sense to most people who haven't read the books. It's probably a movie that is too ambitious to work completely. It's also way too melodramatic at times. It works better after a couple of viewings to understand what's going on.",Dune
5,Sleepin_Dragon,A visual masterpiece.,8,26 September 2021,"First off, an honest confession, I went to the cinema, expecting to be seeing the new film, when the credits rolled, it was this, the original adaptation.Some time since I've seen it, but I still have the same opinions as I did when I first saw it.It's a heavy film, you do need to be a sci-fi enthusiast to enjoy this, partly because of content, partly because of the long running time.I'll start with my favourite aspect, the visuals, absolutely breathtaking, it is a dazzling watch, the sets and costumes are tremendous, the scale of it is hugely impressive, a big supporting cast, it really is a masterpiece, visually. Sure some of the special effects are a little dated now, but that's expected.The story, I have read the book, so I understand the complexities of it, for a novice it can be a challenge, but it's quite a simple story, Spice is the elixir of long life, but it's guarded, and everyone wants it.The acting, is somewhat varied, I still regard the powerhouse performance as being the one from Sian Phillips, who of course plays The Reverend Mother, she is fabulous.I am not sure I have ever fully appreciated just how good an actress Francesca Annis is, talk about a true screen beauty, her presence is huge here, such a beautiful woman.This has given me an even greater appetite to see the new one, however, this remains a classic, it still has the capacity to shock, it definitely still entertains, 8/10.",Dune
6,classicsoncall,"""He who controls the spice controls the universe.""",7,23 December 2018,"I should have known, and actually did expect that the movie, at a little over three hours, couldn't do justice to the Frank Herbert novel that ran nearly eight hundred pages. This was one of those rare occasions where I recently read the book and called up the movie within a short period of time so that a reasonable comparison could be made. Yes, there were many elements of the novel that appeared in the film, though nearly as many elements that weren't, and merely thrown in to fascinate the viewer. One such was the appearance of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan), portrayed as a floating gas-bag with a face pock-marked with pus filled pimples that made him look grotesque. Or the Mentats, described here as human computers, whereas they were more effectively characterized in the novel as elite assassins. Characters in the novel like Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis) had a much larger role in the story that took place, and were much more influential in the mystical development of Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) as the youth who eventually replaced his father to lead the Fremens against the Harkonnens on the planet Arrakis.So it puzzles me to learn that Frank Herbert was actually fond of the David Lynch treatment of his celebrated work, hailed by many as the ultimate work of fantasy fiction. For some, maybe so, but for me it doesn't hold a candle to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and if you extend that argument to cinema, the same holds true. Perhaps the best thing I can say about the movie was it's casting of principal characters. Kyle MacLachlan was a good choice for the role of Paul Atreides, maybe a tad too old to portray a fifteen year old future monarch, but I don't think an actual teenager would have been right to pull off the part. Jose Ferrer imparted the proper gravitas for the Padishah Emperor, and Jürgen Prochnow made for a suitable Duke Leto Atreides. One of the miscasts though had to be Patrick Stewart as Paul's adviser Gurney Halleck, mostly because he didn't have all that much to do and had no impact on the story. There were any number of scenes in which he was left just standing around as part of the scenery.On adapting such a well known and admired book as ""Dune"", director David Lynch has been quoted as saying, ""You've got to be either stupid or crazy to try something like this."" With all due respect to someone who's had his share of success in filmdom, a remark like that makes one too easy of a target.",Dune
7,gavin6942,A Real Joy,7,20 April 2017,"A Duke's son leads desert warriors against the galactic emperor and his father's evil nemesis when they assassinate his father and free their desert world from the emperor's rule.The general consensus is that this is not a good movie. But the general consensus is apparently wrong, because it has a decent rating on IMDb. And, in fact, it is a very enjoyable film and a great adaptation of the novel. On top of that, Lynch was great with his casting choices. Brad Dourif? Perfect! And even Sting.The version I watched ran just over two hours. Another version runs longer than three hours. Whether this would be even better or be too much is not known to me. I would certainly be interested in checking that version out.",Dune
8,jboothmillard,Dune,4,6 March 2010,"It had been years since I watched the original Dune, I must have seen it the once when during my time in college, because the new film was coming to cinemas, and to get a proper opinion, I watched it again, based on the cult book by Frank Herbert, directed by David Lynch (Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet). Basically, in the distant future, the year, 10,191, the known universe is ruled by Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (José Ferrer). The most valuable substance in the empire is the spice called melange, a drug that extends life and expands consciousness. The Spice also allows the Spacing Guild to fold space, allowing safe instantaneous interstellar travel to any distance in space. The Guild fears a conspiracy that could jeopardise spice production, and a plot to destroy House Atreides is revealed. Duke Leto Atreides (Jürgen Prochnow) is reportedly amassing an army to threaten the Emperor's rule. The planet Arrakis, a barren desert planet populated by gigantic sandworms, better known as Dune, is the universe's only source of the spice, and there the native people, the Fremen, have prophesised of a man who will lead them to true freedom. The Guild Navigator commands the Emperor to kill Duke Leto's son, Paul Atreides (introducing Kyle MacLachlan), as there are fears he will somehow threaten spice production. Before Paul leaves for Arrakis, he is tested by the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, his execution order has drawn their attention. The sisterhood's Reverend Mother Mohiam (Siân Phillips) tests him to experience excruciating pain to his hand; to her surprise and satisfaction, he passes the test. On the industrial world of Giedi Prime, the sadistic Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan) tells his nephews Glossu ""The Beast"" Rabban (Paul L. Smith) and Feyd-Rautha (Sting) about his plan to eliminate House Atreides by manipulating someone to betray the Duke. The Atreides leave their homeworld Caladan for Arrakis. Duncan Idaho (Richard Jordan), a loyalist of Leto, suspects Dune holds vast numbers of Fremen who could prove to be powerful allies. Before Leto can form an alliance with the Fremen, archenemies the Harkonnens launch an attack. Leto's personal physician Dr. Wellington Yueh (Dean Stockwell) is a traitor coercing with The Harkonnens; he disables critical shields, leaving the Atreides nearly defenseless. Idaho is killed, Leto is captured, and nearly all of House Atreides is wiped out by the Harkonnens. Baron Harkonnen has Mentat Piter De Vries (Brad Dourif) kill Dr. Yueh with a poisoned blade. Leto dies in a failed attempt to assassinate the Baron Harkonnen with help from Dr. Yueh in exchange for sparing the lives of Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis), Leto's concubine, and Paul. Paul and Jessica survive the attack and escape into the deep desert, where they are given sanctuary by a group of Fremen. Paul assumes the Fremen name Muad'Dib and becomes the leader the Fremen have been waiting for. He teaches them to build and use sonic weapons called Weirding Modules targets spice mining. Over the next two years, spice production is nearly halted. The Spacing Guild informs the Emperor of the events on Arrakis and demands he rectify the deteriorating situation. Paul falls in love with young Fremen warrior Chani (Sean Young). Jessica becomes the Fremen's reverend mother by ingesting the Water of Life, a deadly poison which she renders harmless by using her Bene Gesserit abilities. As an after-effect of this ritual, Jessica's unborn child, Alia (Alicia Witt), later emerges from the womb with the full powers of an adult Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. In a prophetic dream, Paul learns of the plot by the Emperor and the Guild to kill him. He also sees that they fear he will consume the Water of Life. When Paul's dreams suddenly stop, he drinks the Water of Life and has a profound psychedelic trip in the desert. He gains powerful psychic powers and the ability to control the sandworms, which he realises are the source of the spice. The Emperor amasses a huge invasion fleet to wipe out the Fremen and regain control of Arrakis. He has Rabban beheaded and summons Baron Harkonnen to explain why spice mining has stopped. Paul launches a final attack against the Harkonnens and the Emperor's elite Sardaukar troops at the capital city of Arrakeen. Riding atop sandworms and brandishing sonic weapons, Paul's Fremen warriors easily defeat the Emperor's legions. Paul's sister Alia mortally wounds Baron Harkonnen, who is consumed by a sandworm. Paul confronts the defeated Emperor and fights Feyd-Rautha in a duel to the death. After killing Feyd, Paul demonstrates his newfound powers and fulfills the Fremen prophecy by causing rain to fall on Arrakis. Alia declares him to be the Kwisatz Haderach (""one who can be many places at once""). Also starring Leonardo Cimino as The Baron's Doctor, Kindergarten Cop's Linda Hunt as Shadout Mapes, Freddie Jones as Thufir Hawat, Candyman's Virginia Madsen as Princess Irulan, Silvana Mangano as Reverend Mother Ramallo, Everett McGill as Stilgar, Jack Nance as Nefud, Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck, Max von Sydow as Doctor Kynes, and David Lynch as Spice Worker. I'm not going to pretend I understood everything going on, with all the stuff involving religion and politics, just the main plot that everyone wants the spice and that MacLachlan is the saviour, but the all-star cast and Sting are alright, McMillan as the pus-covered villain is disgustingly watchable. There are not bad visuals and special effects, with spaceships flying, giant worms emerging from the sand and fights with bangs and blasts, but otherwise, the majority was taken up by gobbledygook chat and slow pace. It was a box office flop and has been garnered with mixed to negative reviews by filmgoers and critics alike over the years, it is a mildly boring and confusing but not terrible epic science-fiction adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. Okay!",Dune
9,Tweekums,A rather messy sci-fi,6,4 June 2017,"In the distant future control of the universe depends on the control of the spice mélange; it is only found on the planet Arrakis. The spice is so vital because it is essential for space travel as it allows the folding of space so vessels can instantly travel between any points in the universe. Not surprisingly there is conflict to control the spice with various noble families vying for power none of whom seems too interested in the Fremen, the natives of Arrakis. There is however a prophecy that a Messiah like figure will come to lead the Fremen; that man turns out to be nobleman Paul Atreides and he will help them take control of Arrakis and defeat the enemies of the Fremen.This film could have been so much better; the central story is solid but the film is a bit of a mess. Sci-fi set in the future tend to depict a bright, shiny future, like 'Star Trek'; a rather functional future, like 'Alien' or be high camp this is definitely high camp. That wouldn't be a problem but it takes it self far too seriously for such a style. The characters spout dialogue that I assume is meant to sound deep but more often just seemed pretentious. The special effects may have been impressive when it was made but seem rather dated now on the plus side the sandworms that move through the deserts of Arrakis were pretty cool. The characters were okay in an over-the-top way; Paul Atreides was a decent protagonist even if he is too perfect at times. The cast do a decent enough job but I couldn't help thinking all the well-known actors who feature have all done much better work. Director David Lynch has certainly done much better; this may partly be down to studio interference though. Overall I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see this but if it is on TV or the DVD is in the bargain bin you might want to check it out.",Dune
10,paul_haakonsen,"An oldie, but a goodie...",6,14 September 2020,"Well, for a sci-fi movie of this magnitude and based on such grand works of Frank Herbert, I must say that this 1984 version of ""Dune"" by director David Lynch actually still holds up today in 2020. Sure, there is a new and much needed updated version well on the way, but this 1984 is a classic in its own right.Sure, the 1984 ""Dune"" is old, and it is showing on the heavily outdated special effects. Actually, when you sit down and watch ""Dune"" today, it is sort of cringeworthy to see the effects. Of course, they were quite great back in the day, but they have not withstood the tests of time adamantly.The story which is centered upon writer Frank Herbert's novel, is a very entertaining and enjoyable storyline. And it was nice to see the novel adaptation make its way to the screen.What really works for ""Dune"" is the impressive cast ensemble, with the likes of Kyle MacLachlan, Richard Jordan, Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow, Dean Stockwell, Brad Dourif, Leonardo Cimino, Virginia Madsen and Jürgen Prochnow to name but a few of the more memorable and notably profiles in the movie. ""Dune"" is just cast quite well, and there are some very good performances all around, I'd say.""Dune"" is a story-driven movie, and luckily the story is very detailed and have many interesting aspects and layers, which are for the most part explored in a satisfactory manner.If you can get the outdates special effects, then the 1984 ""Dune"" movie is actually quite good. And if you enjoy sci-fi movies and haven't already seen ""Dune"", you most certainly should do so.For me, while I am not overly much a fan of sci-fi nor of the ""Dune"" books, then there is just something appealing about the whole concept upon which ""Dune"" is revolving.My rating of ""Dune"" is a six out of ten stars.",Dune
11,Quinoa1984,"as complex as it is conflicted, and full of artistry that doesn't fully work",6,30 May 2006,"In a sense, I looked at David Lynch's adaptation of Dune on the outset for a while like Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus. This is the filmmaker, usually in total control of his work, putting himself out there for an elephantine production early in a career. But in this case, after having seen the film, it's perhaps not totally clear whether or not the director was compromised by either the producer or the studio. If one were to ask also of me to say if it is too long or too short I'd also be hesitant to answer. At two hours and fifteen minutes, the story feels like it's nearly three, but it isn't. This is a credit to what is done visually in the film, but there are problems afoot. Perhaps one of them is that I, unlike a good many who've written on this site about the film, have yet to read one iota of the book(s). So my approach is not really through the vein of Frank Herbert's work but through Lynch who is maybe more of the reason to see the film. As it is, I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to read the book, and frankly on a first impression it's not on a short list of one I'll read anytime too soon.Because, at least for me, the story (or perhaps, unfortunately to say a part of the storytelling aspect) has a certain glitch to it that reminded me of the Da Vinci Code adaptation, though on a slightly different plane. ""Show, don't tell"" is usually the policy in writing a screenplay. But unlike that example, Lynch, up for the challenge in and of itself of the 45 million dollar production- relatable to the amount of a summer blockbuster of today- tries to add a novelistic approach to the film without necessarily being true to everything in the source. Impressions of this world are paramount for him. Many of the characters are given voice-overs for their thoughts, as they suspect, decree, wonder, and reveal feelings that could perhaps just be on their faces. And as apart of Lynch's way of abstracting in directing his actors, we're given the impression through out of oppression. All of this works, up to a point. On a first viewing maybe it IS all too much to settle into, as the importance of the little things should add up more than they do. The cast- assembled with many knowable faces in a bizarre and curious stretch from Max von Sydow to Sting to Kyle MacLachlan- do what they can, but only a few really give the goods for what they're worth in the framework of their characters.This all being said, Dune's met obvious mixed reactions for many years (which have become even more known to me than the novel itself) and its understandable why. This is in one respect an old-fashioned film, with (again with Spartacus) a Roman-epic aspect, where there are thousands of extras, lots and lots of dramatic action, and a story filled with betrayals, a need for a hero to rise up, and even a religious aspect with MacLauchlan's Paul being a 'Messiah' to the world. There are interesting ideas floating afoot, but unfortunately some of it is lost, and maybe more if one's sort of connection to the film gets severed at some point. So, if the storytelling side of things as Lynch in adapting it attempts for one filled with powerful depictions of the forces of good and evil is likely not a success, the side of the visuals usually, for the most part, is. Even when I ironically had only a vague idea of what was going on (perhaps due to an overload of exposition), I couldn't look away from what he, cinematographer Freddie Francis, 2001 production designer Anthony Masters, and even most of Barry Nolan's special effects were doing for the material. Dated in a couple of parts, this is overall another feast for Lynch fans, as certain creations and work on character (i.e. the Baron) are fantastic, there are dream sequences and other things done to enhance the inherent surrealism of all of this dark fantasy.To put it mildly, Dune is not a very simple film to digest in any denomination. Unlike Star Wars, there aren't any quick starship battles or bits of comic relief. But it does fit into that pantheon of science fiction films that shouldn't be tossed away completely. Here in even one of Lynch's least successful works, maybe his fault in some respects and not in others, there's a lot of brilliant and sensational moments and sights and sounds. There's something striking about how the film is presented, and sometimes how it takes off, that keeps it from not sinking into the otherwise likely situation of an epic running totally off the tracks. And as a general admirer of science fiction the writing that backs up this work from Herbert is not completely lost on me. At least for one thing about the film is certain- this is the only time on celluloid that you'll witness a knife fight between, yes, Sting and Kyle MacLauchlan. In short, DEFINITELY not for everyone. Features also other good actors, by the way, like Brad Douriff, Patrick Stewart and Jose Ferrer.",Dune
12,BandSAboutMovies,A great effort,6,2 August 2021,"I can't imagine being the father of a kid who dragged you to the theater to see Dune without you knowing a single thing about it. This is a movie that spends the first ten minutes explaining the world of Dune and how important melange - spice - is, extending life, expanding consciousness and allow space to be folded. There's also an insane amount of nonsense words blasted at the viewer, stuff like landsraad, gom jabber and sardaukar. Sure, people who devoured the books - hi, I was 12 and never thought I'd ever see a naked woman ever - were ready for the movie. But man, even I can admit that the film can be impenetrable.They gave out a glossary before the movie! Yes, a glossary!For years, this movie lived in development hell. First, there was an attempt by Apjac International - - headed by Arthur P. Jacobs, the producer of the Planet of the Apes films - to make an adaption with David Lean. One assumes that he was picked because he'd already made Lawrence of Arabia. Anne of the Thousand Days and Condorman director Charles Jarrott was also asked, but Jacobs died in 1973 and the rights went to a French consortium.That's when Alejandro Jodorowsky started his quixotic quest to make this movie, as told in Jodorowsky's Dune. If only that movie had come to the screen - planned to star Brontis Jodorowsky as Paul Atreides, Salvador Dalí as Shaddam IV, Orson Welles as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Gloria Swanson as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, David Carradine as Duke Leto Atreides, Hervé Villechaize as Gurney Halleck, Udo Kier as Piter De Vries and Mick Jagger as Feyd-Rautha with music by Pink Floyd and Magma. As the storyboards, designs and script neared completion, the money stopped coming in. All we have to see for the effort are the designs by Chris Foss, Jean "" Moebius"" Giraud and H. R. Giger, but man - what could have been*.Dino De Laurentiis acquired the rights from the consortium and hired Herbert to write a new script and Ridley Scott to direct, but a combination of the pain of Scott's brother Frank dying and the sheer level of work that would be needed to make the film caused Scott to leave the project.By 1981, De Laurentiis renegotiated the rights from Herbert. After his daughter Raffaella saw The Elephant Man, she told her father that David Lynch was the man to make the film, despite the fact that he never read the book, didn't know the story and didn't like science fiction. He agreed to make the film, turning down the opportunity to direct Return of the Jedi.Lynch worked on seven different scripts for the film and his initial cut was four hours long. Universal expected a two-hour movie and that led the filmmakers to cut numerous parts of the film, film new ones and add the opening voiceover that attempts to explain the story. There's another version that tries to explain even more - the extended cut - that Lynch took his name off of and replaced with Alan Smithee**. As the director would later say - he rarely will discuss the film, won't be part of a director's cut and considers it the only failure of his career -""I started selling out on Dune. Looking back, it's no one's fault but my own. I probably shouldn't have done that picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the structure to do them in. There was so much room to create a world. But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis of what kind of film they expected, and I knew I didn't have final cut.""As for Jodorowsky, he was upset that Lynch had the opportunity to make this film yet he believed that he was the only other director capable of making the movie. He refused to see the film until his sons made him go and he ended up being overjoyed, seeing that it was a failure. He said that he knew that the fault was not Lynch's but the money men.Herbert would say in his short story collected Eye, ""I enjoyed the film even as a cut and I told it as I saw it: What reached the screen is a visual feast that begins as Dune begins and you hear my dialogue all through it.""As for the critics, they hated it. Harlan Ellison claimed that this was because they were denied early access to the film. Luckily, over the years, people have come around to seeing this as a flawed piece of art.Dune is a movie that simple to explain - a young nobleman named Paul Atreides becomes the leader of a band of rebels on a desert planet - and difficult at the same time to really go into, because the original book is 412 pages of Herbert being inspired by psilocybin and cultivating mushrooms.I've always just tried to go along for the ride and enjoy the astounding visuals and the cast in this. I mean, José Ferrer, Freddie Jones, Sting, Brad Dourif, Kyle MacLachlan, Jack Nance, Patrick Stewart, Jürgen Prochnow, Paul Smith, Dean Stockwell, Max von Sydow and Sean Young all in one movie***? And sandworms? And energy shields that look like Atari graphics?Also, to this day, I remain stunned that they made coloring books and action figures for this movie.*To be fair, it would have been a 14-hour movie that was only inspired by the book. Herbert said that the script was ""the size of a phone book.""**The name he chose for the screenwriting credit was Judas Booth, which is a play on two traitors and how he felt about the producers of Dune.***Aldo Ray was originally cast in the role of Gurney Halleck but his alcoholism was out of control. His wife Johanna ended up casting many of Lynch's films and their son Eric DaRe was Leo on Twin Peaks.",Dune
13,Scarecrow-88,Dune,7,24 November 2006,"While the story is anything but simple, the heart of it concerns the planet of Arrakis, which holds a specific spice which yields a magic to sustain life, stretch the conscience to new heights, and even possibly the ability to ""fold"" space. The Emperor(José Ferrer) wishes to command that planet, but needs to rid himself of the people of Atreides who seem to be close to holding a deal with the spice planet once dominated by the evil people of Harkonnen. There's a traitor amongst the Atreides, put there by Baron Vladimir Harkonnen(Kenneth McMillan, really hamming it up to a maniacal level in nearly every scene he's featured in), so that the Harkonnen race can retake the planet and spice reserve. Paul Atreides(Kyle MacLachlan)was supposed to be a female child since that would've created harmony amongst the planets, but he is quite special in how the story unfolds. He seems to have this destiny in place to lead the people hidden on Arrakis to overtake their own planet and be the guiding force over the other planets.Trying to cram so much Herbert into a decent running time seems just too difficult a task for Lynch who tries to cover up the muddled unevenness with technical savvy. Visually, DUNE is a canvas of pure art in set design and a pleasure to behold. Yet, the film suffers when it comes to story-telling and visuals can only take you so far. This cast is really good, but they aren't assisted by the dialogue they must speak. Sting and Brad Dourif seem perfect for their benevolent roles as Harkonnen henchmen as Lynch does show his often sadistic side in film with embellishing these beasts with much more attention than the heroes which seem to come off cold. Certain characters like Linda Hunt's Arrakin Shadout Mapes or the charismatic supporting players Richard Jordan(as Duncan Idaho;soldier for Paul), Patrick Stewart(as Paul's trusted teacher Gurney), Jürgen Prochnow(as Paul's father and the leader of the Atreides), & Max Von Sydow(as Dr. Kynes)barely get enough time on screen to develop.Still, the film is dazzling to look at even if it suffers badly in the overall complete Lynch product. I can understand why people side against it since Lynch isn't really your true Hollywood filmmaker and comes the closest to being that in his film DUNE. It still has enough signature moments(specifically when we see the Harkonnen side where we see the design of their ships and planetary structure of dark, steel, and smoke;not to mention how the Harkonnen side behaves with morbid delight in their horrendous deeds)such as the weird dreams Paul has, the visual template of unusual thought narrative, and the diseased sores on the Baron's porcine face.",Dune
14,preppy-3,Yes--it's an incomprehensible mess but not totally terrible,2,27 August 2011,"This takes place in the year 10,191. There's two families--the evil Harkonnens and the good Atreides--fighting over a planet called Dune where some mystical spice is produced. The Harkonnens are run by the evil Baron Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan) and the Atreides led by Paul (Kyle McLachlan). There are wars, double-crosses, killings, sandworms, mindreaders and the Fremen (people with blue on blue eyes).I saw this when it came out in 1984. I had never read the book and went with a friend of mine who had. I knew I was in trouble when the opening narration (by the beautiful Virginia Madsen) was completely incomprehensible! (And WHY does her face keep fading in and out?) My friend kept whispering to me during the first hour to explain things to me. No one shushed us (my guess is THEY were lost too and were listening to him to figure it out too:)) After an hour he gave up confessing even HE was lost! If you have never read the book this movie makes literally no sense! The first hour or so is orientation to these worlds and their various problems. Characters appear and are (almost) instantly killed at a bewildering pace. Everything is thrown at the audience so quickly you spend most of the time trying to catch up while they throw MORE information at you! After I saw the movie I read the book (which is very long and dry--no pun intended), saw the movie again and THEN understood it...but it's still pretty bad.It was a bad mistake to try to fit every character in the book into the movie (Linda Hunt's character is introduced and killed a few scenes later!). My guess is the studio thought fans of the book would complain if ANYTHING was changed so they had writer/director David Lynch get every character into the script. Also the book was WAY too complex to condense into 137 minutes. Things are either unexplained or go by so quickly you're lost. It's a surprise Lynch did this. I later heard he did this on the provision that he would have complete creative control over his next film--""Blue Velvet"". This was supposed to be a big hit and ""Blue..."" to be a bomb...but the exact opposite happened. Lynch did the best he could with this but it was hopeless. Also the sandworms look REAL stupid! This isn't a total disaster though. The movie LOOKS fantastic. The sets are huge and beautiful. The costumes are (to say the least) eye-catching and the battle sequences are long, loud, BIG and exciting. It has an incredible cast too and no one's really bad. Of particular note though are McLachlan (tall and handsome), McMillan (enjoying himself and REALLY chewing the scenery), Francesca Annis (as Paul's mother), Brad Dourif (enjoying himself as much as McMillan) and (surprisingly) Sting. There's also 8 year old Alicia (Roanne) Witt as Paul's creepy sister Alia. When you see her at the end all dressed in black with only her small face and blue on blue eyes visible--it's downright scary! Great score by Toto also. Is a good movie? No. It won't make a bit of sense if you haven't read the book and it has a VERY dark tone (how this got by with a PG-13 is beyond me) but there's always something to look at and the production design is impressive. Still I can only give it a 2.",Dune
15,poolandrews,"Bloated science fiction film, a bit of a mess.",5,27 December 2012,"Dune is set in the year 10191 at which point the known Universe is ruled by Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth (José Ferrer), this is a Universe where the most important thing is a substance known as Spice which allows for instant interstellar travel. Spice is only found on one planet in the entire Universe, the desert planet Arrakis which is also known as Dune. It raises considerable political eyebrow's when the Fourth Emperor hands ownership of Arrakis over to the Atreides family from their hated enemies the House of Harkonnen, the handing over of the ownership of Arrakis is just a smokescreen in order to wipe out the Atreides, the Harkonnen's & the Emperor's personal army are sent to Arrakis to kill the Atreides including the Duke (Jürgen Prochnow) & his son Paul (Kyle MacLachlan). The Duke is killed but Paul manages to escape into the desert & join the native Fremen tribe who want their planet back, Paul has immense psychic powers & uses them to train & help the Fremen as they prepare to to battle with the Emperor & his evil empire...Written & directed by David Lynch this film is based on the novel Dune by Frank Herbert which was first published as a book in 1965, several filmmakers had toyed with the idea of filming it before this version was produced. I have never read the original Dune book so I cannot say how this adaptation compares but judging by those who have Lynch's script seems to retain enough detail to confuse regular audiences like myself not familiar with the source material yet takes enough liberties with the story to disappoint fans who are familiar with the book & therefore falling between two camps & not really pleasing either. It's a compromise that doesn't satisfy anyone particularly, having just sat through the original theatrical version of Dune for the first time I am in two minds. While the film is fascinating to watch with some of it's bizarre imagery & ideas I just found it too confusing, I had a really hard time keeping track of everyone & everything that has going on. The insistence of using odd names doesn't help because it's difficult to relate a name to a character, the dialogue is stiff & dull & the entire film takes itself deadly serious. I don't think think there's one light hearted moment in the entire film, it makes the two & a bit hours duration difficult to endure at times, with a plot that obviously mirrors contemporary issues on Earth like political unrest, people in power abusing their position, drugs, the idea that if you control something worth money that your powerful, the whole cross culture acceptance, drugs, religion & environmental concerns so I guess the book tried to say a lot & the film also tries & while these issues are valid they get in the way of an entertaining film & are never addressed with any great conviction. I just find it hard to believe that the average person is going to sit through this (whether it's the 130 minute theatrical cut or the 170 minute extended television version) & enjoy it, the story is too complex & challenging & it's not told in a very likable way either. The scope of the film is too big, it's difficult to follow & understand & the lack of any humanity to the character's makes it difficult to relate to anyone.It's not all bad news though because the look of Dune is fantastic with some great special effects & amazing production design, the sets are memorable from the wooden elegance of the Atreides home planet to the art deco style of the Harkonnen's to the barren desolate wastelands of Arrakis. The costumes, props & production design are magnificent & it's quite easy to be drawn into the wold of Dune & it's politics. Some of the models look a bit like models & some of the effects are not as good as other's but generally they are impressive, there's none of this CGI computer effect work which plague films these days & I defy anyone to say the giant Sandworms would have look half as good as CGI computer graphics. The extended television edit was put together by the producers using outtakes, unused footage, deleted scenes & even repeating a few moments as well & some shots are missing special effects (the Fremen & their blue eye's in particular) & was sold to television stations who spit it into two parts & showed it over a couple of nights, apparently this version is even worse, has no pace & is even more of a mess.With a supposed budget of about $40,000,000 I suspect all involved thought Dune was going to be an epic, some of the numbers involved are epic like apparently 1,700 people worked on it, it had 80 sets on 16 stages & took over six years to make with director Lynch working for three & a half of those. The acting is very wooden, there's a good cast here that are given horrible dialogue that means nothing & are asked to create proper character's around it which was never going to be easy.Dune was obviously made at the time it was to cash-in on Star wars (1977) but while Star wars is a fantastic film that is hugely entertaining Dune isn't, by the time the end credits roll on Dune you are wishing for the sheer simplicity, likable character's & magical touches seen in Star Wars rather than the confused politics seen here.",Dune
16,CinemaSerf,Good but flawed effort with a difficult story...,6,25 September 2021,"I write not yet having seen the 2021 iteration of this story, but until now I have never quite found a screen version of Frank Herbert's novel that does real justice to his book. His story is complex, nuanced - with characters that take quite a while to unfold, and with plot twists that mingle everything from the mystic to the megalomaniacal - with just about every human emotion and vice squeezed in too. The premiss of the story centres around the control of the spice ""Melange"" that can extend life. In best Montague and Capulet style, there is an old family rivalry vying for control of this - with plenty of underhand, Machiavellian, manipulation afoot too. David Lynch has tried hard with this, his casting provides considerable experience and depth - particularly the truly odious and vile ""Baron Harkonnen"" (Kenneth McMillan); the arch witch Siân Phillips and Francesca Annis lights up every scene she is in just by showing up! Kyle MacLachlen in the lead role is not remotely convincing - however, he just, for my money anyway, couldn't shake the ""butter wouldn't melt"" look even at the end which itself is presented to us in a rather two-dimensional fashion. The special effects look to have come straight out of the George Lucas book of lights and magic, save for the make-up - which looks as if it came out of the early ""Doctor Who"" one; and though the light effects work quite well; the budget clearly wasn't there to adequately disguise the superimposed, green screen effects that rob the film of much of it's adventure elements. The screenplay is adequate, but again falls between the stools of detail from the novel and supplemental imagery provided on the screen - we end up with a depiction of the story that really lacks the penetration or intrigue of the book. It benefits greatly from the big screen experience, and has a sort of anonymous rock and roll soundtrack that works well, too - but in the end it's a sort of hybrid of just too many other films that though quite enjoyable, just isn't that good.",Dune
17,utgard14,Dune Buggy,4,30 November 2013,"Largely incomprehensible boring mess of a movie that goes on forever. It's saved from complete failure by some nice imagery and special effects. But the visual spectacle is really wasted on this joyless material. Imagine Star Wars without the fun and excitement. It looks and feels much more like a Dino De Laurentiis film than a David Lynch film, for what that's worth. A great cast but they all seem to melodramatically overact. I'll place that blame on Lynch. Oh and I never read the book and doubt I ever will. So I'm not one of those. I just think its a sucky movie. Contrarians and posers will certainly love it more than the average viewer.",Dune
18,grantss,"Grand in vision but random, unfocused, bizarre and often laughable in execution.",4,6 September 2018,"It is the year 10,191 AD. The most valuable item in the universe is the spice Melange. The planet Arrakis is the primary source of this commodity and it is now the setting for Machiavellian scheming by the Emperor Shaddam IV. The houses of Atreides and Harkonnen are sworn enemies and the Emperor plans to eliminate Atreides by pretending to side with them, just to have Harkonnen destroy them. The ruler of House Atreides is Duke Leto Atreides. His son and heir is Paul Atreides, a man the Emperor is most particularly keen to kill.Written and directed by David Lynch and based on the Frank Herbert novel, Dune has heaps of potential but never comes close to living up to it. There's a grandness to Lynch's vision for the movie, demonstrated through the special effects and scene settings, which makes you initially think this could be really good. However, it doesn't take long for you to realise there's no substance behind the style.The plot is all over the place and largely incoherent. One gets the feeling that Lynch figured that all the viewers had read the book, so no need to join the dots. Heaps of information provided, not much of it makes sense or links to other information. The plot just seems to lurch from one development to another, often in nonsensical fashion.Then there's the dialogue. Or should I say 'internal monologue thought aloud'. The actual dialogue is pretty poor but it is the thought narration that is most laughable / irritating. It fills the movie, hardly a scene goes by without it and it is just empty and pretentious, adding nothing. By the third time I heard Kyle MacLachlan whispering ""The Spice! The Spice"" I was ready to shoot the TV, and he got to say it a lot more after that.Throw in some weirdness just for the hell of it and the whole thing becomes quite laughable. Not sure what was the most bizarre, there's so much to choose from: the cat scene, Sting's space age budgie smuggler/codpiece, the Baron's hovering and random antics, to name but a few. Well, it is David Lynch, so par for the course, I guess.Big-name cast but all of them get to look like amateurs due to the poor script and demented direction. They must all look back and cringe at how cheesy they and the whole thing looked.",Dune
19,Boba_Fett1138,Somewhere in it all there is a great movie.,7,2 January 2010,"This movie had everything in it required for me to make a great movie out of. It's a science-fiction movie set in the far future, at far off places, it has a good main concept and characters in it but yet it all somehow doesn't work out too great.Guess that some stories just work out better in books. It's obvious when watching this that they had plenty of story material to use. Too much really, fore the movie is filled with a well written plot that however gets told in a far too fast pace to comprehend it all. The story becomes pretty messy to watch after a while when too much information gets provided and more and more characters with ridicules and difficult names get introduced. It becomes hard to keep an hold on all of the characters motivations and intentions and you'll just start to loose interest after a while. The movie is still pretty good for what it is in it's first 2 hours but after that point it all becomes far too messy.I've watched the long version of this movie, which is, I suppose, better than the short, cut for TV, version. Direcor David Lynch also disowned the short, cut version, which is the reason why he is credited as Alan Smithee.For a science-fiction movie from the early '80's it definitely has some good looking effects. The movie is loaded with special effects and fans of the science-fiction genre shall also not be disappointed by it. It's a pretty large scale movie, with large sets and such, that is impressive to look at.The movie is filled with some big name actors in it but yet overall there mostly gets overacted a lot in this movie, which should have to do with the movie its script and especially dialog. Seems that some of them had no clue what they were doing and saying in this movie and what it all was about. It helps to give the movie a bit of a cult status but it also seems like a bit of a waste of the acting talent that got involved with this movie.Deep inside this still is a great genre movie but the end result as a whole simply does not pay off.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Dune
20,neil-476,Has its moments,7,17 April 2011,"I read Dune when I was in my teens (I read a lot of science fiction in those years). I was never completely sold on it - it made me work too hard. I liked my science fiction to give me an easy ride, and Dune was heavily plotted, densely textured, and required more from my underdeveloped little brain than I was happy to give it.I did like the sand worms, though.Enter David Lynch's film some 15 years or more later.Lynch has successfully managed to maintain much of the denseness which characterised the novel - the film is also rather hard work.But does it have sand worms? Yes it does, and they are well realised, so I can forgive it much.Actually, there is a lot to like here. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood is loathsomely Machiavellian, the Harkonnens are vile, the world of Dune and the Fremen are brilliantly realised, and the effects generally are extremely well done for the time. There is a huge and star-studded cast, an epic feel, and Herbert's multiple plot lines intertwine nicely.It is still hard work, though.",Dune

I'd tried but never found the time, energy, or opportunity. I'm glad I did.It is an epic fantasy movie dealing with house feuds (House Atreides v. House Harkonnen), mystics, prophesies, and giant sand worms. It is a little difficult to follow at times with the various names, families, and races of people, but the overall gist of the story can be understood.Like most prophecy movies you have a faction trying to aid the prophecy and a group trying to prevent it. In this movie Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) is the subject of the prophecy and must be killed for the sake of greed and power. Of course, if it were that easy to kill Paul then it wouldn't be much of a prophecy, or much of a movie either.",Dune

Also, there are a lot of cool desert scenes and shots too.  All in all a rather good film, even if it isn't easy to comprehend (though it may just be me).

23,Wuchakk,The ultimate sci-fi train wreck,3,4 December 2016,"Released in 1984 and directed/written by David Lynch from Frank Herbert's sci-fi tome, ""Dune"" takes place in the distant future, where a Duke (Jürgen Prochnow) and his family are sent by the Emperor of the known universe (José Ferrer) to a sand world from which comes a priceless spice-drug that is essential for interstellar travel. The Duke and his family are slated for assassination, but his son, Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan), escapes and corrals the planet's natives, the Fremens, becoming nigh messianic.If you thought 1974's ""Zardoz"" was a sci-fi train wreck you ain't seen nothing till you've seen ""Dune,"" perhaps the worst major-release sci-fi flick ever made. Actually, the movie starts out promising as Princess Irulan (Virginia Madsen) explains the basics, her head superimposed over a space background. The ensuing floating alien sequence is intriguing and well-executed. But the movie bogs down with Paul's tedious preparation for his mission to Dune. The next sequence switches to the home planet of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan) and it's so campy with its gay snuff scene that it seems cut & pasted from another movie. Every other scene with the hovering fat bastage is equally goofy. Then there's an uncanny folding-space-to-travel sequence that's cool, but at around the hour mark the movie goes off the rails and never recovers. It becomes so bad you have to see it to believe it. It's unfathomable that this was a major release and cost $40-45 million in 1984 dollars.The basic plot, as described above, is actually simple and it's a good one that could've worked; not to mention, the cast, sets, costumes and many of the effects (for 1984) are stellar. There's a lot of eye candy here; Sting is in his prime as Paul's rival and Madsen & Sean Young are young and breathtaking, particularly the former; Francesca Annis is also striking as the hero's mother. There's some ear candy too with the score by Toto. But the devil is in the details. The overabundance of characters, the pretentiously muddled verbiage (intermixed with strange, long names you can't remember), the campy elements, the lousy F/X (even for 1984) and, mostly, the utter lack of story-thrust doom the film. By the second half I no longer cared about the characters and their story. I just sat and tried to enjoy the eye & ear candy till the end.I want to emphasize that I can handle bad effects and campy or amusing elements in sci-fi, as long as the story is somehow engaging. The original Star Trek TV series is Exhibit A. But, like I said, ""Dune"" utterly fails to deliver the goods with a driving narrative, particularly after the first hour. If ever there was a move that was a chore to sit through, this is it. Be forewarned.RUNTIME: I saw the original 137-minute cut and that was more than enough; I'm glad I didn't see the Extended Cut, which runs 177 minutes or, worse, the Special Edition, which runs 190 minutes.ADDITIONAL CAST: Silvana Mangano and Siân Phillips are on hand as gross-looking ""Reverend Mothers"" while Dean Stockwell appears as some type of doctor, Patrick Stewart (pre-TNG) as an elderly warrior, and Max von Sydow as another doctor. There are hundreds of others.FILMING LOCATIONS: Studio work was done in Mexico City with other sequences shot in Chihuahua & Sonora, Mexico; Zzyzx, California; and Yuma, Arizona.GRADE: D+",Dune
24,The_Void,Cinema has never seen a film as tedious as this one,3,30 June 2005,"David Lynch's highly lambasted take on Frank Herbert's cult novel 'Dune' kicks off with an intro that makes out as if you're in for an interesting time. When it's finished, however, and you realise that there's a further two and three quarter hours until the final credits role; interest in the movie falls sharply. The introduction to the film is long, and covers the same things more than once. The fact that it uses lots of different family and society names after only briefly explaining what they're about ensures that it's overly complicated, and this ensures that the movie is setting itself up for a turgid ride. Things get worse after that, as when you realise that the introduction doesn't just set the scene, it also sets up the tone of the movie; the next two and three quarter hours seem like a very daunting prospect indeed. The intro goes on and on, covering the same plot elements multiple times and if you think this is boring, just wait until the movie starts properly. The word 'dull' is about to take on a whole new meaning...cinema has never been so tedious.David Lynch is famous for his dark movies, and a foreboding atmosphere is as much a part of the man's cinema as the man himself. The lavish sets compliment his atmosphere; but unlike later feature 'Blue Velvet', for example; we never really get the impression that Lynch cares about the movie, and the darkness of the film only really comes about through the style of the sets and the downbeat performances. The way that the plot plays out is slow; very slow, and it would seem that nobody in the film really cares about the movie. The battle sequences are cold, lifeless and anything but exciting; and every performance in the film in surprisingly one-note. Kyle MacLachlan, the same man that Lynch used for Blue Velvet takes the lead role and really just makes himself look stupid. His looks, mannerisms and screen presence epitomise the situation that the actor has been forced into. Many of the scenes that he has to do are ludicrous and the high budget, but low quality style of the movie always ensure that the film looks and feels exactly like it is - trash. The fact that the film has no heart only increases this lacklustre feel.I really do find it hard to believe that this film was considered a 'big budget' screen adaptation. Quite what it was spent on, I have no idea. Throughout, the film looks low budget and hokey, and not in a good way. The effects are terrible, and don't come close to many earlier Sci-Fi fantasy films such as Star Wars or Alien. In fact, I was shocked to find that the special effects weren't done by some guy in his garage. The centre-point of the film is these giant worms that inhabit the planet of 'Dune'. These are mentioned early on, but Lynch still makes us wait nearly an hour and a half before we're allowed to finally see one; and when we finally do, it's just one giant disappointment. They're neither inventive nor well brought to the screen and despite an impressive sequence that sees one eat a mining facility; the worms are very much wasted. One of the film's saving graces is the score, which is moody and nice to listen to; but even the film's good points aren't put to proper use, and the movie has simply been saturated in this score; rendering it extremely dull after the eight hundredth time of hearing it.The version of the film that I saw was, unfortunately, the three hour long television edit version that Lynch subsequently disowned; leaving the film to be credited to Hollywood's scapegoat director; Alan Smithee. I don't blame Lynch for disowning the movie; I would have done the same thing, but I can't imagine Lynch's cut being any better. The film is too fundamentally flawed to be good no matter how it's edited. The slow and dull way that the dialogue is delivered is a showpiece for the slow and dull way that the plot itself plays out, and the fact that the film obviously takes itself seriously and seems to think that it's special effects sequences are offering a new breakthrough in film technology are laughable at best, and extremely irritating at worst. This sort of thing should have cult value for it's low budget and silly effects; but it doesn't even garner that much respect thanks to it's major flaws. As a fan of cult kitsch cinema, this is the sort of film I usually enjoy but in fact it's turned out to be one of a very select few films that I genuinely wish I'd never laid eyes on. David Lynch missed out on directing the concluding chapter to Star Wars to make this film and that may have been one of the silliest mistakes in the history of dirtectors' silly mistakes. This is not Star Wars, or even Spaceballs - it's just balls.",Dune
25,Mr-Fusion,"I walked into this blind, and that was a mistake.",3,20 September 2014,"-Note: this is after watching the Theatrical Version-I realize after sitting through DUNE that I probably would have a much sunnier disposition towards the movie had I read the books first. And that's the central problem with this movie: it requires the viewer to do the legwork before the lights dim and the credits unfurl. There is a massive barrage of information that comes at you from the very start, with exposition delivered through internal thought or just characters speaking it outright. There's even a floating head in the beginning of the movie that starts spitting out background to get you up to speed. For someone who's never before heard the word Arrakis or Spice, this narrative is impenetrable. Simply put, there is no way to get that much literary material into a 137 minute runtime.That said, it's clear this wasn't a movie made on the cheap; the budget's right there on the screen in those huge sets. But the movie's tone is too often soporific and these huge ships just lumber along. I wasn't expecting galactic warfare or dogfights, but does the whole thing have to be so subdued? Patrick Stewart, for his part, at least gets some dashing flair, and seeing the bass player from The Police was pretty cool. If they'd played up the camp a bit, then we might have something more like FLASH GORDON (c'mon, it's got a score by Toto!). But on the whole, this is just an incoherent mess. I'm fully aware that if I return to this after having read the source material, my reaction would probably be a whole lot different. But as it is, this is not something I want to return to anytime soon.3/10",Dune
26,siderite,"Accidentally capturing the weirdness of the book, by ignoring most of the story",8,8 March 2017,"I liked Dune when I first saw it and now I watched the alternate fan version, which is longer, to understand what I liked then and what Lynch wanted to do.Loving Herbert's work and pretty much disdaining Lynch's, I come to comprehend now that Dune is a bad movie. It is a low budget, Italian movie that somehow managed to appear American. It had a most ridiculous script and some of the scenes are simply hilarious (see Patrick Stewart shout Long Live the Duke! while going into battle with a small dog in his arms). It more or less ignored 90% of the Herbert book. Yet it somehow captured its spirit, which is more than the other adaptation succeeded.The moral is that if you have read the books, your brain will fill in the blanks while watching the movie and it will seem more than it actually is by itself. This raises interesting questions: should a movie be a visual representation of a book or its companion, provoking thought and offering different perspectives?My conclusion is that the weirdness of the movie and the inner voices of the characters somehow expressed more of the feel of the book than the scene by scene reproduction from the 2000 miniseries. I hope that the new rumored Denis Villeneuve adaptation will manage to be faithful to the book in both story and spirit, although I think it will be very difficult to do in film format.

Initially it was to be directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky with input from Salvador Dali, both men famed for their surrealist leanings. This collaboration did not ultimately happen but the movie was eventually directed by another famous surrealist film-maker, David Lynch. At the time he had come off the back of the big success of The Elephant Man, while his name had been made by the unique nightmarish Eraserhead. From what I can recall, Lynch hadn't actually read the novel and was most interested in possibilities inherent in the name Dune itself. He agreed to make it on one provision and that was that if he did, producer Dino De Laurentiis would allow him final cut on a subsequent movie of his own. So in this way, Dune was directly responsible for Lynch's next film, the classic Blue Velvet.What of Dune itself? Well, I myself have not read the novel so I am depending entirely on the film for the story. Without prior knowledge of the book it is quite hard to follow overall it has to be said. Key information is presented briefly and a rewind function certainly helps! Its story basically is about two rival houses – the House of Atreides and the House of Harkonnen – that inhabit separate planets and vie for dominance. The Emperor of the known universe plays them off against one-and-other, over a substance known as the Spice. This precious material allows for the folding of time and subsequently, long distance space travel. It is the only substance known that can do this and is therefore hugely precious. It only exists on the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. One of the people involved in this drama, Paul Atreides, emerges as a messiah figure prophesised by the people native to Arrakis, the Fremen; he changes things irrevocably.It's quite obvious that Dune was given the cinematic treatment off the back of the success of the Star Wars films. It has similarly high production values. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all of a very high calibre. It's extremely visually impressive. It could be argued that Lynch's personal style is lost in this huge big budget production in a genre unfamiliar to him. To a reasonable extent this is certainly true. But there are some clues in the lighting of shots and of course the cast, several of whom he worked with on other films. And also the more grotesque details were seemingly not in the book itself and added no doubt with Lynch's influence. So there are some elements of his style here for sure. I find Dune overall a film that improves with repeat viewings. The fantastic production design really helps but I also like how, despite surface similarities, it goes for something altogether more left-field than the Star Wars films. Hard to follow for sure but worth the effort if you give it a chance.",Dune
29,thesar-2,Spice Guys,3,29 September 2021,"*I* was so Dune.I understand it's David Lynch, but this is probably the very first movie I've ever seen where I knew less about it after I watched it.I never really wanted to see this because, at one time, I couldn't stand desert movies. And the only clips I saw from this was one huge desert. And I heard people complain it's not like the source material. So, when the latest remake was scheduled for release soon, I figured now would be a good time to ""catch up"" on that universe. (Plus, it helps: now, I LOVE desert movies such as movies set in the desert, in a small desert town, westerns, neowesterns, etc.)Doubt I'd give an accurate synopsis since I have literally forgotten 80% of this movie I never fully understood all during my viewing last night. But, suffice to say, it's a Star Wars/Messiah story of ""The Chosen One"" will save us all! And one of the few neighboring inhabited planets make this ""Spiiiiice"" that's basically oil and/or gas and people will literally die for it. Or I guess make love to it in their fantasies.I think the producers also knew people would be as lost as I was so they added in everyone's thoughts which was sooo distracting. It reminded me of Death Bed: The Bed that Eats where ""characters"" had their thoughts narrated in addition to a narrator. Both movies had this calm, bedroom voice ADRs.I know this movie came out nearly 40 years ago, but it's hard watching it for the first time in 2021. All I could do is compare it to Star Wars (which is fair,) Blade Runner (also: fair,) Tremors, The Matrix, The Fifth Element and Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. Which might be a testament to how many films may have mimicked this movie but in reality, these ideas in Dune have been around for a century.Also, this felt like 6 movies into one. There is probably more exposition in this than in 5 movies combined. Hell, even the poster has basically a full page of a required reading. And it all went so fast and furious with so many different angles, backgrounds, very unmemorable weird names used alongside odd planet names and all the drama of a year with any of the Real Housewives. Was I supposed to be taking notes? It felt like a pop-quiz would be in an intermission.Some special effects were fantastic, but some...oy vey. Those were BAD FX. And I've seen SOOO much better long before 1984. Overall, the look wasn't catchy or pretty. I understand that might have been the point, but it was never eye-catching cinematography.Still want to see the updated 2021 version, especially with that cast. LOVE me some Rebecca Ferguson and really like Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin (No Country reunion!,) Dave Bautista, Jason Momoa (Oh! Marvel/DC cross-over,) Charlotte Rampling and David Dastmalchian. And maybe if they rerun the same story (I was going to say basic story, but it was anything BUT,) I'll have an easier time following it.***Final Thoughts: No joke, I was literally saying, ""Wait, who? Wait, who's the bad guys? Who's from where, what's their motivation again and are these the same humans in Star Wars? Even being such a long movie, you need to slow it down! You're All dunned!""",Dune
30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Spicy.,2,25 September 2021,"When a movie starts with an out-of-context exposition dump which rattles off term after term of made-up sci-fi concepts that you have no chance in hell of actually remembering, you know you're in for a bad time. 'Dune (1984)' is honestly one of the worst films I've seen. Period. It's absolutely terrible. There are so many things you could say about it, so many reasons why it just doesn't work, but I can't for the life of me bring myself to say them. I just don't have the energy to think about this absolute mess, let alone analyse it. I suppose you'll just have to trust me when I say it's truly, genuinely awful. I have no idea how there are actual fans of this thing. I'll try to just quickly summarise my thoughts, so as to find a middle ground between writing an actual review and subjecting myself to the pseudo-torture that is reflecting on this travesty. So, first thing's first: it's bone-crushingly boring. It's so boring that it's actually difficult to watch, the experience just washing over you as if you aren't even having it. Seriously, it's almost like you're staring at a blank screen for two hours. I somehow know less about 'Dune (1984)' now than I did prior to watching it, and all I knew then was that there were giant worms and tubes going up people's noses. Secondly, none of it makes any sense. It chucks random concepts and nomenclature at you like they're going out of style, making logical leaps so large that there's simply so way they can stick the landing. The story is less an actual narrative and more just a series of things that happen. Characters come and go without any real explanation, their motivations often never being established and their inclusion sometimes feeling oddly unnecessary. There's a bit where the bad guy tells a prisoner that he has been poisoned and has to milk a hairless cat everyday to get the antidote (like, what?) and then the prisoner isn't seen again until the climax anyway when he turns up completely fine and without a milked cat. I'm serious. All of this just adds to the picture's boring nature. Even if you want to engage with it, you can't; it's insanely difficult to follow. I don't mind weird films - in fact, I often like them - but they have to have some sort of continuity, they have to work as a narrative experience. This just doesn't. It's actually quite strange that the flick is hard to follow in a way because it over-explains absolutely everything. I mean, some of it does need to be explained, but some of it simply doesn't; the thing doesn't know the difference between the two. Almost every character has an audible inner monologue that's only ever used as a cheap way to deliver on-the-nose exposition and, sometimes, reaffirm what has just been seen or said. Seriously, there are times where one character will say something and another will literally repeat the exact same thing in voice-over, indicating that the first person has indeed said we've all just heard them say. It's incredibly annoying to be honest, and makes the piece feel like it doesn't respect its audience. The story has no semblance of pacing or structure. It's massively over-stuffed, often skipping over years at a time, but also feels as though it's maybe half of what it was initially intended to be. When the finale rolled around, it took me a few minutes to realise it was actually the finale. Then, there's a final one-on-one fight that's meant to be an epic ending but actually just feels random. Why do these two want to duke it out so bad? They share no screen time. It's weird. Plus, even though I knew I didn't like the affair embarrassingly early, I still felt as though I'd been mugged when the credits came on. It didn't steal my money, it stole my time. Arguably, that's worse. Look, there are a whole host of issues with the picture but I don't want to go into it anymore than I already have. As I mentioned, I just don't have the energy. I will say that the set-design, costuming and special effects are all distinct and, generally, well achieved. Most of the actors are doing a decent job with the material, too. There are worse films out there, I'm sure of it (there's nothing wrong with the flick from an ethical point of view, for example). Very few that I've seen have been so utterly disengaging, though. It's awful, way worse than I ever expected. I do not recommend this movie at all. It's also sapped all my excitement regarding Denis Villeneuve's recent adaptation, which is truly a feat as he's one of my favourite directors. Prior to watching this, I'd have said I'll watch any film he makes. Now, I'm not so sure. 2/10.",Dune
31,ThomasDrufke,I Guess a Dream Unfolds?,3,13 March 2015,"I had heard numerous good things about Dune. Perhaps it's because it's been so many years and people try to pick the worst scenes and find humor in them. But for me, Dune is straight garbage. I cant believe I wasted 135 minutes of my time watching this trippy film with no retainable substance. Sure, Dune lovers may enjoy this film because of it's reliance and interpretation of the book, but it has nothing for people who go into it with no prior knowledge.It's the year 10,091 or something, which i'm not sure why it needs to be THAT far in the future, and there are 4 different worlds, none of which you can remember the name to. One of the planets is relying on some random 'prince' or 'duke'-esque figure to save the day by attaining the rice. Throw in quite a few nipple bursting scenes, Sting attempting to act with a weird hairdo, and voice-overs that attempt to guide the audience but end up doing the complete opposite, and you have Dune. It does have the great Patrick Stewart and Max Von Sydow. But don't worry, they only make glorified cameos here. The problem with Dune is that there is such a lack of real communication between characters. We don't learn enough about either the heroes or villains to care in the end. It's basically voices in their head that do most of the talking.The first half is also surprisingly action-less with a budget of almost 45 million in 1984. The budget doesn't even become useful in the climatic battle scenes that are cut off by more over-acting, magic blue wine, and nipple bursting. I cant pretend that I know exactly what happens in the film or what it means for any stretch of the imagination. But I do know how a good film works, and Dune isn't one of them. Basically the only redeeming thing about Dune is it's catchy score.+Score -Can't follow the story -Poor use of special effects-Undeveloped characters -No communication between characters -No substance 3.2/10",Dune
32,ericstevenson,Uh?,6,19 March 2017,"This is the strangest movie I have seen in a long time. I have not read the original Dune novels by Frank Herbert, but am aware of how popular they are. It seems like most people either love or hate this movie, but for me, it's just okay. I was turned off by how strange it was. Yes, I should have been more familiar with the story to understand it. The movie tells the story of a universe where the most valuable resource is a spice that's only located on one planet. They outright say that in the beginning. I'm glad because once again, this film just confused me.There's this weird giant talking cocoon thing. I'm sorry people! I don't know what that is! I knew there were giant sand worms in this and I was disappointed that they weren't featured more in the actual movie. Hey, we still got to see them and they looked amazing! These characters are wearing these things over their noses to breathe on another planet which I swear was ripped off by the Psychlos from ""Battlefield Earth"". The movie looks amazing and it isn't stupid or anything. It was just hard for me to understand. **1/2",Dune
33,Irishchatter,Odd but not exciting....,6,18 October 2015,"I decided to watch this film because a guy in my class thought this is one of the weirdest films he ever saw and that you would easily get lost if you have read the books. For me, I didn't understand what the hell was coming out of everybody's mouth. It sounded as if they were speaking gibberish for a 1980's Sci-fi film. I wouldn't really call this the most weirdest film I've ever seen but more likely, it's just odd and too fast to understand it to be honest.I haven't read the books but I say I wouldn't understand them much either. Maybe not but if I really didn't understand the film, then I won't understand the books. The only advantage is seeing Sir Patrick Stewart being involved in this since I'm use to him in Star Trek!",Dune
34,inkblot11,Fans of the book will approve of this film,7,11 September 2006,"In the future, there are two great dynasties. One, the Atreides, are noble, kind, and good human beings. The other, the Harkonnen, are evil through and through, but hold great power and sway with the ruling emperor of the galaxies. The Harkonnen, led by the wicked and degenerate Baron, are out to get the Atreides, naturally. With an elaborate plot, they arrange for Duke Leto and Jessica Atreides, with their young adult son Paul, to become rulers of Arrakis, a desert planet. However, it is a trap and the Harkonnen have a traitor in the midst who will help, Baron hopes, to wipe out the Atreides line. What the H do not count on, however, is that Paul may be a long awaited miracle man capable of leading the inhabitants of Arrakis to destroy the Harkonnen and the emperor's misguided plans. Who will reign at the end, the good or the bad? The book, by Frank Herbert, is easily one of the best books of all time. It is complex and, therefore, probably difficult to bring to the screen. Nevertheless, this version is truly an acceptable homage to the book. It has good visuals and tries successfully to bring out the intricate details of the book, such as Paul as the messiah of the universe, the witch-nuns who try to influence history, and the excesses of the evil Baron. The cast is superb, with Maclachlan giving Paul a wonderfully gallant presence. Do give Dune a try. It is science fiction at its best and the film makes a valiant effort to make the story accessible to all.",Dune
35,Bored_Dragon,The sleeper has awakened,6,4 March 2019,"David Lynch is ashamed of his own adaptation of the famous novel by Frank Herbert, and unfortunately, I have to support him in that. I watched ""Dune"" as a kid back in the eighties and I liked it, and I even defended it recently in some internet discussion, but now, after re-watching it three decades later, I realize that it was an ardor of nostalgia rather than arguments based on the quality of the film. Considering genre and theme, the adaptation of Herbert's novel is not something we would expect from Lynch, but Lynch has left a very strong imprint of his own style, so the film does not deviate much from his canon. The film has its qualities, among which outstanding sound and music are highlighted, as well as some visual effects that are fantastic for their time. It features some sound names such as Brad Dourif, José Ferrer, Linda Hunt, Kyle MacLachlan, Virginia Madsen, Patrick Stewart, Sting, Dean Stockwell, and Max von Sydow. On the other hand, the film has serious shortcomings. As much as the scenes with the worms are fascinating, there are some visual effects that are so tragicomic that I was embarrassed. Also, in my opinion, the style of David Lynch does not go along with this story. But the biggest drawback of the film is that it's too hastened. Although the scenario is quite faithful to the source material in the sense that it does not deviate from it, the novel by Frank Herbert is simply too big for a two hours movie. Lynch did a good job and made the movie watchable and understandable to those who have not read ""Dune"", but nevertheless, I had the pervasive feeling that I was watching a gigantic trailer and not a movie, so the overall impression is quite weak.6/10""A person needs new experiences.

36,tabuno,Aging with Wrinkles,8,11 January 2019,"17 February 2017. The primary reason one might allow this original Dune movie directed by David Lynch is that it retains some of the breakthroughs in set design and images as well as its decent, but by now stilted attempt to bring one of the most difficult film adaptations of the classic Frank Herbert sci fi novel to the big screen. Elements later can be seen in Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Next Generation television series and the Borg, even epic royal court attempt of Jupiter Ascending (2015).Nevertheless the special effects are apparently out of date, there are places of stiff acting performances, and some uneven editing. Yet the ambiance captures the original novel and even that of some of Iaasc Asimov's classic Foundation trilogy.",Dune
37,The-Sarkologist,You must not fear - fear is the mind killer,9,14 May 2013,"It is a shame that the DVD that I ended up buying of this film ended up being the extended TV version as opposed to the original theatrical version. Okay, the TV version is longer, by from what I remember of the theatrical version there is little that has been added to the extended version that actually makes it any better. In fact, I am more disappointed by what they took out of the theatrical version (namely the scene where Baron Harkonan opens the heart plug of a prisoner at the beginning of the film) than what they added to the extended TV version (though I suspect that some of the cuts probably had more to do with censorship than anything else).As you are probably aware this film is based on the book of the same name, and I have ended up reading the book, though it was quite some time after initially seeing the film (and the book doesn't have the heart plugs in it). I can't remember much of the book though, probably because my head has since been dominated by the film (and also it is incredibly thick, meaning that there are lots of other books, thick or otherwise, that I would probably rather read). However from what I understand the book and the film are actually quite faithful towards each other, The story is set centuries in the future, and one of the good things about the extended TV version is some of the background that it explains. Basically humanity had developed robotics and computing to a point where robots did everything for them, which made them incredibly lazy, and this opened them up to exploitation. However, humanity revolted against their overlords and destroyed all of the robots, so that now, in the far distant future, there are no computers - everything is done by mental power alone, with the telepathic Bene Geserit and the super logical and mathematical Mentats.The story itself is about a political struggle between two major houses of what is known as the Landsrat, and it is for control over the planet Arakis, otherwise known as Dune. Arakis is famous as it is the only place where spice milange is produced, and the spice allows humanity to travel the stars, as well as giving the Bene Geserit their powers. Basically whoever controls Arakis controls the universe, and at this time the Harkonans control the spice production. However the Harkonan's rival house, house Artredes, is gaining in popularity, and that threatens the position of the Emperor, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of the Duke.In a way this story reflects the struggles that are reminiscent of our times, and have existed throughout time. We have the struggle between the Spacer Guild (representing technology) and the Bene Geserit (representing religion, but more specifically organised religion) as well as the struggle between the Harkonans, which represents tyranny and Artedes, which represents liberty. This is not necessarily correct, but when you notice that the Harkonan home world of Gedi Prime is an industrial behemoth and that all of the Harkonan's have red hair (and Russian names) you get an idea of what this house represents (where on the other hand, Caladan, the Artedes homeworld is a rocky world swept by storms). Notice also that the world in which the struggle occurs is a desert world, and it is from this desert world that the source of the ability to travel, and thus the ability to rule the universe comes, which in a way reflects the struggle, which existed even at the time that the book was originally written, for control of the Middle East, a desert land which is the major producer of oil, the key to our society and our wealth.Think also of the Fremen struggling against the empire, and the Fremen is being led by one of the Artedes, who used to be apart of the empire, but has now been cast out of the empire through treachery. It is also interesting that it is through one who had been conditioned to be loyal that is the traitor, but the reasoning is not to betray the one who he serves, but to seek revenge against one who has caused him harm.Yet we note that this is a story that deals with the great and the powerful. The Siddaks Hazorack (sp?), or the Messiah, is one who has been specifically bred by the Bene Geserits, and is the son of high born nobles. While he may have been cast out of his position through treachery, he is still the son of a noble, a prince. This is thus a story of great people doing great things, not of ordinary people doing great things. This is a story of a man who, though a specific breading program, was created to be the messiah, not a messiah that was born to a normal person. However, as is the case with messiahs, this messiah was intended to be controlled by the Bene Geserit, but they were not able to control him, and in then end he brought about their destruction.",Dune
38,tomgillespie2002,Often visually beautiful and delightfully complex,5,21 March 2012,"So, OK; It's another Messiah story! These films are so overly present in the history of science-fiction/fantasy films. Even in the last decade or so we have seen these films being constantly produced (see The Matrix (1999) or Avatar (2009) as just two recent examples). It's the narrative of a young man, who progresses through a story to become the legendary myth of a person embodied as the saviour for an entire race, universe, galaxy... However, if we move back to 1984, the Hollywood film industry was still trying to capture that cash-cow essence of Star Wars (1977) and it's celebrated special effects, and it's fantasy setting. Therefore, any project that had space-ships, monsters etc were being made regardless of their relationship to the ""kids"" film. Dune, based on the epic and elaborate novel by Frank Herbert, is a very complex piece of cinema, that baffled many audience's and critics alike (I personally can't see that it is confusing at all). But then, if we look at the majority of the genre films made at the time, we can see how it could be see as perplexing next to the generic, simplistic stories being told. Inevitably, the film was a major flop, and with the $40 million budget, practically bankrupted 20th Century Fox, and also (thankfully) convinced director David Lynch to never work on a big budget, Hollywood-funded film again, and due to his contract with Dino De Laurentis, he was able to make his masterpiece, Blue Velvet (1986).Dune is a narrative of warring planets, and the machinations of the politics that rule the galaxy. Dune is a desert planet that has never seen water, and on this planet is a substance called spice melange, that is the most important essence in this world. Whoever controls the spice controls the universe. The spice enables a means of travel without moving; it has the ability to fold space, and also expands consciousness. The main warring ""houses"" are of the Atriedes and the evil Harkonnens. Paul Atriedes (Kyle MacLachlan) is the son of Duke Leto (Jurgen Prochnow), and his mother Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis) who is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a race of women who are able to read minds and control the minds of others. With his royal connections, Paul is held in high regard. But as the story progresses it is clear that there is more to this boy that was first expected. After a conspiracy to create a war between the Atriedes and Harkonnens, Paul and his mother are left stranded on the planet Arrakis (also known as Dune), where the prophecy of the saviour and the dreams that Paul had been haunted by, comes to pass.Whilst the films narrative complexities are difficult to concisely lay down the full story, the essence is very simple. It is incredible that Lynch's screenplay managed to deal with Herbert's book, which is incredibly sprawling, but he managed admirably. The sets and costumes for the film are incredible, and even today (and after seeing the films several times) I am amazed at the look of the film. The costumes and props are incredibly eclectic - we have iconography from all over the place: Victorian austerity, 1930's telecommunications items, Nazi-style uniforms, and elaborate baroque back-drops. OK, so many of the special effects are incredibly dated, and others seem to have been cobbled together at the last moments on a shoe-string budget, but this does not hinder the experience of the film. Produced at a time when complex genre films were simply not being made, it is a film to watch several times, which reveals more each time. It was a project that was always going to be difficult to produce, with two other notable directors being previously attached to the film (Ridley Scott and Alejandro Jodorowsky - wish the latter happened with the proposed cast of Salvador Dali and Orson Welles, and music by Pink Floyd), it's amazing the film was made at all, and I salute Lynch for an admirable, often visually beautiful, and delightfully complex film, that I love more each time I see it.The film also has an incredible supporting cast (Brad Douriff, Jose Ferrer, Patrick Stewert, Max Von Sydow, Dean Stockwell, to name a few), and there are very Lynchian elements that delight me every time. I mean, where else in Hollywood genre cinema would you see the main villain of the piece, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillen) having his face injected with diseases by his personal doctor?www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Dune

40,Dr_Coulardeau,Beautiful vision of an archaic feudal world in the distant future,9,9 January 2007,"That film is a superb adaptation of Frank Herbert's first novel of his Dune series. We could of course harp a lot about the symbolism of names, the Fremen being free men, and the Harkonnen having a Germanic name, and the Atreides having a Greek sounding name, and the Emperor having an Arab name, and we could also add that the witches, the Bene Gesserit have a Latin sounding name, etc. We could also said that the name of the hero, Muad'dib also sounds Arabic, or is it Hindi, though the frequent aspirated 'h' of this latter language is absent from this writing and pronouncing. But that is superficial and the worst name and being is not present in this film and book, the real Arabs, the Sligs, the hybrid of a giant slug and a pig, who are the direct reflection and mirror image of the caricature of the sly Arab living by the sharia so common in the West. What is interesting in this volume and film is the political intrigues along with the prophetic dimension of the plot. The political intrigues revolves around the Greek sounding Atreides, the honest ones from a planet of oceans and rain; the Germanic sounding Harkonnen, the rotten (actually rotting) polluting industrial ones who are violent, vicious and sadistic, slightly vampiristic too; the Persian sounding Emperor Shaddam, bringing together the Shah of Iran and all the Saddams of the Arab world; the Spacing Guild that controls the universe by controlling travelling in that universe; and finally the Fremen, an underground free species of human beings who believe in a prediction of a Messiah and are mostly invisible on the planet Dune. The Bene Gesserit is also present with their plan to produce the perfect new Messiah, God, Savior through genetic manipulations by guiding the reproductive schemes among the powerful from whom the Messiah can only come. He will nevertheless come for sure, but by accident and thanks to the alliance of Paul Atreides, the last representative of the Atreides House, his Bene-Gesserit-trained mother and the Fremen. Some will see in it the caricature of the world in the Cold War. Of course we have to know one thing that is not immediately clear: the fact that this world is the heir of the Butlerian Jihad that destroyed all thinking machines and then banned the construction of such machines, forcing human beings to develop their skills at calculating and thinking to keep the control over things. But this vision is slightly short. It goes beyond and it reaches the level of a reflection on what politics are: a fight among a very few superior leaders who are essential born as such and vaguely accepted by some managing more than governing council. Democracy is the value that is totally absent from this story. Even the Fremen are not democratic since they believe in a supreme leader, a messiah, and their actions are mostly mass-reactions, extremely collective methods of governing and controlling their own people. That future world then will not be different from the old feudal world of six or seven centuries ago. The people, the mass of people necessary for those constant wars and feuds, are nothing but pawns that die on the screen and in the sand of Dune without any kind of concern for their lives or even simply life. They are non-entities, including on the winning side of the Fremen. That world is dehumanized and does not defend any kind of ideal or principle. The film is perfect though with its special effects and its immense cosmic and desertic scenery. The film is very dense and thus the suspense is quite effective. The film then is nothing but an action film with good situations and interesting characters, be they heroes or be they monsters. This vision of the world remains rather primitive though and maybe even lower than what could be normal expectations. It satisfies though the desire for survival and victory over danger that lurks in the circumvolutions of the human brain. That's probably why this film, and the books behind, still have a positive life in our culture. Messianic characters and situations contrasted to apocalyptic treachery will always be a favorite of the human mind.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",Dune
41,poe426,Duned...,8,4 April 2014,"With California suffering from ""its worst drought in 500 years,"" the time seems right to revisit DUNE. In CHINATOWN (which, by stretching our imaginations, we can kinda sorta view as a prequel to DUNE), we saw the kind of underhanded, backstabbing methods people used to gain control of this planet's most precious commodity- Water. Flash forward to Today, with the aforementioned drought (and other, more disastrous droughts worldwide), and it's kinda easy to project a future in which the planet Earth has been renamed Dune, the Desert planet. Of particular interest to me was the homeworld of the villainous Harkonnens, an oily, polluted industrial planet where people ate ""sqood"" (small animals in squeezable packets with tubes inserted so that the user could crush said critter and suck out its bodily fluids) and required implants just to be able to breathe the unbreathable air. It just rings TRUE, you know? (Not long ago, despite waiting lists a mile long and donors in understandably short supply, former Vice President Dick Cheney was actually able to get a heart transplant. If ever a politician brought to mind the likes of the Baron Harkonnen, it was Cheney. The Military Industrial Government marches on and on, into the far future, by virtue of brain and organ transplants...) Not Lynch's best, maybe, but not the bomb most people seem to think it is, either.",Dune
42,johnnyboyz,"It's fascinating but unfortunately, most of its fascination and aura has been born out how misguided and misjudged it really is.",5,18 April 2009,"Dune should have been more fun; more enjoyable and smarter than it actually was. Additionally, it might have been easier to follow but for the annoyingly consistent voice-over work which features the constant use of words and terms, spoken in hushed and annoying whispered tones, that only those invariably well informed with Frank Herbert's 'Dune' will even begin to understand. What the film ends up being is a cocktail of science-fiction, horror, revenge and self-discovery played out amidst a sea of stars, planets and gross-out visuals that force me to label Dune one of the films with some of the most misguided material I've ever seen. A case of fluffy but nonsense voice-overs one minute, harmless space travel the next and then a disgusting scene about 'heart plugs'. To think, we go through all this before having the film boil down to a drab knife fight between good and evil.Yes, Dune's a mess but it's one that puts us through a blender of varied emotions; even if I'm not sure I wanted to experience the majority of them. The film is, predominantly, a story about one man being established as someone rather important before a tragedy befalls him and he is whisked away to another lifestyle, having to re-establish as an individual, both to himself and those new around him, in the process. Eventually, that character we follow will become the leader of a small band of people he'll lead to supposed victory; he is the holy leader ancient texts predicted and a glorious warrior at times of need. To some, this'll sound quite daft but to others it works very effectively as the classic escapist fantasy: focusing on a lowly, but capable of extraordinary things, ranked in terms of word-of-mouth male being whisked out of his 'normal' life and plunged into a mission of great importance. Two examples of varying quality produced since Dune might be 1994's Stargate and 2006's Children of Men, both of which feature relatively hapless and unsuccessful males of varying degrees burdened with missions linked to saving an entire population under an umbrella of a world thats float in and out of both science-fiction and horror.It's a shame Dune wasn't as good as it could've been. You can most definitely see why some may like it; its appeal of a broad and escapist world in which stars, planets, adventure and different sorts of species exist is one that was booming at the time of Dune's release given the success of Star Wars plus-sequels. But Dune feels laboured compared to those films and it feels inconsistent in its tone enough to turn off its audience. The lead of the film is Paul Atreides (MacLachlan), a young man and son to a very important Duke named Leto Atreides (Prochnow), residing on the planet of Caladan. Very early on, and in clear cut contribution to Dune's wavered feel, Paul is put through a series of tests to do with pain, commitment and some sort of reaction to possible imminent death. Some of the scenes, particularly when he must place his hands in a mysterious box and take whatever's in there, are quite torturous in their execution. For all his supposed importance in the hierarchy, they certainly make life hard for him.But it's a test, and following this, a plot involving several clans from neighbouring planets arises to do with destroying the Atreides family from which the idea to kill Paul is born. All this and the increasing tension between everyone linked to the planet of Arakis, a lonely desert planet on which an element known as 'The Spice' is found; a vital ingredient for life and space travel – without it, most things are useless. The film, in a sense, reminded me of Ridley Scott's 2000 effort 'Gladiator', if only in structure. The idea that a relatively important individual must begin again after a family bereavement, gain the trust of a group of people and lead them to glorious victory while vanquishing his own enemies.But there is no battle weary Russell Crowe having his family killed before becoming a slave, a gladiator and then an avenger happening here, although that it what Dune essentially is but for its more bizarre inclusions. With this, we get a lot of fancy images and a bizarre emphasis on the visual as Paul dreams what he is supposedly destined to be. This is put across through droplets hitting water in slow motion and bizarre green moons eclipsing as Paul drifts in and out of consciousness. Around all this is the film's antagonist named Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (McMillan); a fat, flying, oozing, spitting, bumbling character with a severe case of acne – it may be many-a millennium into the future but facial cleansing, it would appear, still manages to elude certain people. The good Baron dresses in dark, rubber outfits and gazes at Feyd Rautha who is, bizarrely enough, played by musician Sting.I read that in recent years Lynch himself has dis-owned Dune, something that I guess isn't surprising given his style and legacy that has evolved since 1984. After all, it's not as if David Lynch has become renowned with large scale genre pieces that rely on the visual over all else and contain a large scale battle scene here and there. It's not like he's become the sort who uses the mise-en-scene to assault our senses and force us to turn away rather than engross us and bring us into this dream-like picture he's created. Still, it could've been worse: at least Lynch didn't cast himself in the role of the saviour/visionary/leader whom acts as certain sections' 'second coming' and leads everyone to glorious victory. That really would've entrenched the film in the realm of the unwatchable.",Dune
43,leplatypus,Dune (screen) (vhs) (web),10,27 August 2015,"This is maybe the only movie that i went to see with my dad only and this was in 1985 when i was then 10 years old. I think that we expected to see a fun space-opera as « star wars » so we were a bit perplexed with this one. For me, it wasn't bad, just very strange. Now, 30 years later, i find it more powerful and finally excellent and i think that Lynch is maybe a bit harsh with himself : for one time, we have a Lynch's movie with a quick pace, a (rich and deep) story clearly told and meaningful and its design, its dream sequences are enough strange and poetic to tell the difference with other traditional movies. With this screening, 3 things come out : 1) it's maybe the only SF movie that is steam-punk oriented : Dune's worlds seems like the old Europe with only better technology ! 2) As deserts fascinate me, i like this strange planet which is a distant cousin of Tatooine and Sarlaac monster 3) the thematic is deeply religious with the special one, the prophecy and in that field, it beats the same ideas used in « Star Wars » without hesitation ! At the end, the best proof for this movie being good is that after it, i want very much to read the novels !",Dune
44,TheMovieDiorama,Dune lacks the valuable spice needed to prevent this deserted adaptation from collapsing in its own inhospitable quicksand.,4,23 April 2020,"Has everybody got their trusty notebooks? No? Well, it is advisable you acquire one now: ""A beginning is a very delicate time. Know then that it is the year 10,191. The Known Universe is ruled by Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, my father. In this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice Melange. The spice extends life. The spice expands consciousness. The spice is vital to travel."". *insert more introductory exposition regarding spice mutation and the ""ability to fold space""*. ""The spice exists on only one planet in the entire universe. A desolate, dry planet with vast deserts. Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts are a people known as Fremen, who have long held a prophecy that a man would come, a messiah who would lead them to true freedom. The planet is Arrakis, also known as Dune."". *insert even more exposition outlining the rivalry between two factions, House Atreides and House Harkonnen*. ""The powerful Bebe Gesserit sisterhood for 90 generations has been manipulating bloodlines to produce Kwisatz Haderach, a super being. On Caladan, Jessica, a member of the sisterhood and the bound concubine of Duke Leto Atreides, had been ordered to..."". Actually, let's stop there. It's provided me with more than enough melange to criticise this absolute incomprehensible mess.Surrealist director Lynch was recruited to direct and write an adaptation of Herbert's lauded novel of the same name. His first, and only, studio endeavour that would attempt to amalgamate the complexity of Herbert's thematic exploration into dystopian sociopolitical religions with the imaginative visionary wonders Lynch could supply to a feature film. Many directors had attempted to adapt Dune. Including Jodorowsky and Scott. None were successful. These failed ventures substantiated one question: ""why?"". Why was it so brutally challenging to adapt Herbert's sci-fi extravaganza. The simple answer? The novel is too dense to compress into a feature film.Lynch's screenplay, having resorted to a five minute introductory narrative heavily denoting the lore and background of the proceeding feature, is an accumulation of plot. Every single grain of contextual sand covering the Arrakian wasteland would proliferate into a narrative dune of plot. There's no characterisation. No menial conversations. No long stare into the open desolation of Arrakis where colossal sandworms roam the arenaceous landscape. Every line, every pause and every word of dialogue substantiates its central or various sub-plots. It's all plot! Yet despite a two and a half hour feature of sheer vigorous plotting, the final product still does not make any comprehensible sense. What was the entire purpose of the mutated Guild Navigator? Why did Paul Atreides instantly fall in love with Chani? What's with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sexually assaulting and slaughtering a young man? How about the entire final ten minutes?The point is, no matter how much plot is compressed into one feature film, it cannot cover the substantial expansivity of Herbert's imagination. Gibbs' complacent editing butchered the narrative flow regardless of Lynch's usage of psychic narration and foreshadowing to masquerade clumsy plotting. Attempting to detail the story's grand entirety comes at the expense of zero characterisation and minimal emotional investment to the ornately designed worlds. The protagonist, Paul Atreides, was borderline dull. MacLachlan's performance was on cruise control. The rest of House Atreides failed to exhibit any emotion, other than soulless. Fortunately von Sydow and Stewart added some dramatic prowess to the pace, despite their underused presence. Members of House Harkonnen contrastingly shouted everything at piercingly booming decibels and overacted all facial movements in pantomime fashion. There was no inbetween. Just two rampantly fluctuating volumes of acting credibility. Frustratingly, Lynch's adaptation had promise.Despite the extravagant mess that was manufactured by studio interference and creative misdirection, the technical excellence embedded within managed to shine various glimmers of hope. The costume design inhibited the grandeur of Herbert's intergalactic story. The merging of visual and practical effects enhanced the action scenes involving ""Weirding Modules"", essentially sonic weaponry. Toto's 80s rock score suited the desolate rocky environment (it's not ""Africa"" though...). And heck, riding sandworms across the desert to obtain freedom? Hell yeah!Alas, Lynch's intended vision was not meant to be. As a general sci-fi enthusiast and admirer for ambition, condensing an approximately four hundred page heavy fictitious novel into a mere two and a half hour plot summary was not the route to pursue. It may evoke technical astuteness and imagination, yet crumbles into an incomprehensibly shambolic mess of galactic proportions. Much like sand, ""it's all coarse, and rough, and irritating. And it gets everywhere!"".",Dune
45,Tweetienator,May the Spice be With You,10,23 February 2018,"Imo Dune is one of the best sci-fi-movies ever made and e.g. far more impressive story- and graphic-wise to Star Wars. Frank Herbert's Dune cycle is for sure one of the best sci-fi/fantasy epics ever written, imo even superior to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings - in imagination, philosophical and political depth, the universe of Dune is unchallenged by most other fictional works with only a very few exceptions.David Lynch adapted the first book of Frank Herbert's epic accurate, only changed in some details. The actors are very good ones (e.g. Jürgen Prochnow, famous for his role as der Alte in Das Boot, Sting as the Harkonnen Feyd Rautha, Linda Hunt, Patrick Stewart etc). Maybe they are not the biggest stars of Hollywood, but all are serious and very good actors indeed (well, Sting proved he can do acting too).Sadly, the project was due the lack of financial success not continued. Imagine, the whole of Frank Herbert's work (not those stuff from his son) would have adapted into movies of this quality! Dune is one of the most unique movies of the sci-fi and fantasy genre like The Dark Crystal (Jim Henson, Frank Oz), Flash Gordon (the 80s movie), Blade Runner, The Matrix and Fight Club.Lucas' Star Wars is for the inner cowboy and Indians or dragon hunting knight part of our self.

It's odd and unique.I still haven't read the book, but I've seen the other versions of this story. The five part series twenty years ago had more detail. So I am thinking that with all the material they had to shorten the movie and that meant scenes were cut out.I still find this enjoyable even after 30+ years.

48,marmar-69780,Dune,4,14 September 2020,"Dune is by far the weakest film from David Lynch ,but i dont blame him for this film,but rather studio that hired wrong director for this kind of film.I mean David before this one directed Eraserhead and Elephant man,two films that had nothing connected to a Sci Fi genre so who ever hired David it made a very bad decision.What i hated the most in a film were narrations and explaining everything and everyone to audience,special effects dont hold back very good expecely mirrors fight,script was also very bad in moments and story and characters are all over the place and everything felt wasted and cut short.Dune was a big mess of a movie",Dune
49,Vartiainen,"Doesn't quite capture the feel of the book, but is still very epic",8,11 September 2021,"An early David Lynch film adapting a Frank Herbert novel of the same name. Taking place in the distant future, it depicts young Paul Atreides's (Kyle MacLachlan) journey as his family takes up position as the rulers of the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune, source of the drug melange, catalyst of space travel and source of eternal youth.The original book is one of the great works of science fiction, still very popular even today and hauled as a masterpiece. It's a meditation on power, when and how to wield it and whether or not it should be wielded. It's also an epic in every meaning of the word.And while Lynch's adaptation suffers somewhat due to limitations of the budget and the state of special effects at the time of its making, it's still more than valiant attempt. I especially like MacLachlan as Paul and Francesca Annis as Lady Jessica, his mother.Then again, the rivals of Paul and his family, the Harkonnens, are way over the top goofy, whereas in the book they're coldblooded killers and menace beyond reason.Likewise it's a tad weird to have Toto, the band, providing the soundtrack, but I can't say I minded it.Not a perfect adaptation by any means, and I'd hazard that it'd be a bit difficult to follow if you haven't read the book, but even still it's pretty epic in its own right.",Dune
50,paul-allaer,Re-saw it in the theater for the first time since 1984/5,5,29 July 2019,"This past weekend I watched ""Dune"" in the theater (more on that later), for the first time since I saw the film originally when it came out in late December, 1984 (so I saw it late 84/early 85). I literally remembered next to nothing of the film before walking into the theater...As ""Dune"" (1984 release; 136 min.) opens, we are informed it is the year 10191, and that the melange drug, a/k/a/ ""the spice"", is the most precious commodity in the universe (to do with space travel) and available only on one planet called Arrakis, a/k/a Dune. We get to know Paul, whose father is the Duke (and hence important). The universe is ruled by an evil Emperor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would, well, be impossible. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: oh boy, where to begin... This is one of acclaimed director David Lynch's earliest movies (he didn't have final cut), and was made on a then almost unprecedented mega-budget of $40 million (more than $100 in today's money). Yet all that talent and money doesn't guarantee a good film, and that was the case here. The biggest flaw is two-fold: on the one hand it is simply impossible to adapt a book that runs almost a thousand pages into a 2 hrs. 15 min. movie. In fact, the movie feels almost incomprehensible from the get-go as we are overwhelmed with information. Second, and this is possibly correlated to issue 1, is that the movie doesn't take the needed time to establish these characters and hence for us to want to care about these characters. Just think back why Star Wars was so successful and resonated so much with the public, whereas Dune left us cold (not to mention, bewildered, or worse). The acting performances are okay, if sometimes laughable (hello, Sting?). The special effects are surprisingly cheap and cheesy for a movie with such a large budget, as if done cheap and cheesy on purpose. I had completely forgotten that the original (orchestral) score was done by none other than the band Toto, yes, THAT Toto! The audacity of it all! All that aside, I was glad to re-experience Dune but it also reminds me why I hadn't felt compelled (until now) to see this again. And it whets my appetite for the remake that Dennis Villeneuve is working on, reportedly as a 2 movie arc, with the first one scheduled to be released late 2020).I saw ""Dune"" this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, as part of the moth-long ""Sci-fy in July"" series. The Sunday afternoon screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 20 people), and there were 3 more screenings to follow. If you get a chance to check out ""Dune"" in the theater, I'd readily suggest you do so, and then draw your own conclusion as to this (in)famous 80s sci-fy cult movie.",Dune
51,FiendishDramaturgy,One of Sci-Fi's Best Epics,7,21 March 2007,"Reviewing this is, for me, like reviewing the original Star Wars. Where does one begin? A compilation of ingeniously created worlds, endearing characters, superb creativity, and a most intriguing story, Dune is the epitome of classic sci-fi. The darkling twists, the intrigue, the plots and sub-plots, all come together to deliver a rousing saga of treachery, nobility, and redemption.This is probably one of the best science fiction works out there, and as far as I'm concerned, is one of the very best. The Director's Cut (or Extended Edition, whatever) contains all the pre-story material a Dune fan could dream of.This is a classic, and is a definite must see by any budding sci-fi fan, although it lacks lightyears from the Herbert source materials.It rates a 7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Dune
52,jamesrupert2014,Ambitious but flawed attempt,5,12 October 2018,"There are some good parts in David Lynch's much maligned version of Frank Herbert's famous novel but they are few and far between. The main score is generally excellent (except when it pointlessly switches to dated '80's guitar rock), some of the images of the endless deserts of Arrakis are quite well done, and, although primitive and simplistic by modern standards, the early use of CGI in the shielded fight scenes should be lauded. Unfortunately these plusses are greatly outweighed by the film's deficits. The producers seemed to have little faith in the actors, so almost every action is accompanied by an explanatory voice representing of the person's thoughts. Some of the acting, especially the various villainous Harkonnens, is awful. The novelty-casting of Sting as Feyd-Rautha doesn't help: he spends too much time trying to look evil by smirking and fiddling with a knife but whatever menace he establishes is quickly undone when he steps out of the steam-bath in leather pampers. Kyle MacLachlan, who plays the central character Paul Atreides, generally looks uncomfortable and out of place, which is not helped by the constant melodramatic voiceovers. Patrick Stewart's Gurney Halleck is good (although why he has to carry the little dog is beyond me), as is Max von Sydow who plays Kynes, the exobiologist and honorary Freman who introduces Paul to the desert planet. The special-effects set pieces (especially the sand-worms and the climactic battle) have not aged well and despite some nice 'steam punk' stylings, the film still looks like an overproduced 1980's Italian vision of the future. Lynch has essentially disowned the film as have many fans of the book. I didn't like ""Dune"" when I first saw it 34 years ago and a recent rewatch on Netflix didn't do much to change my overall opinion. There are rumours that Denis Villeneuve will soon direct a remake and, as there have been some great successes in filming 'unfilmable' books (""The Lord of the Rings"" being an obvious example), perhaps the next film will better capture Herbert's stark and lofty vision.",Dune
53,dfranzen70,Pile of glop best left to Herbert fans,4,22 February 2000,"Maybe it's just me, but someone has to put a stop to people who adapt long novels into movies. More often than not the adaptation leaves out entire chapters, whole characters, all in the name of brevity and coherence. I give you as evidence most of the Stephen King oeuvre - the nuances of characterizations are lost in most cases. The movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" is a little different, though. It's plenty long enough for those nuances to show up, but its underlying problem is that it's just plain incomprehensible. Maybe the book's better, maybe not, but I had problems figuring out the story at all. I know the thing's set about 8,000 years into the future, (which, if I were suddenly transported there, would be very confusing to me anyway) but even at the very begining, while the story's being set up, one gets the feeling one stepped into the middle of a long tale. And if you're confused right off the bat, folks, chances are pretty good things won't be cleared up for you later on. Really, though, I was watching this movie and it was so confusing it was as if they were speaking a different language. Sure, I know it's David Lynch, and he's made a career out of strange movies, but dull and leaden pacing isn't strange, it's boring. So imagine sitting in your doctor's waiting room, waiting to be called for your appointment. You're reading magazine after magazine, bored out of your mind.

Oh, they took some liberties, like the ""weirding module"" sonic weapons. Still, the costumes, the sets, they all take you into this strange universe.Now, for the purists out there, there are actually several versions of this movie, including the three hour theatrical cut and the four hour television cut. This is essentially because David Lynch filmed everything that was in the book, but then tried to edit it down into a 3 hour movie. The four hour version includes a different voice-over, (Virginia Madsen's character of Irulan is rendered completely irrelevant in this version.) and a detailed back story trying to explain why these futuristic people didn't have computers or robots, which is what everyone expected to see in a 1984 Sci-Fi movie.",Dune

But the entire Harkonnen family was miscast, misdirected, and malformed. They were in fact a noble house, not members of ""The Police"".The entire Harkonnen side of the tale practically ruins the film with the unbelievability.And there is an awful lot of people ""thinking"" in this, which of course the way the book is, with unspoken thoughts. But it was too much.Missing the Party at the Atreides House, Duncan Idaho's whole story is missing, and the dialogue from the book that makes the book great is simply not there.And casting Sting as Feyd-Ruatha was kind of a mistake. And all he could say was ""I'm gonna kill you"". So, no. In the book, Feyd is almost as devious as Vlad Harkonnen.The dialogue between Paul and Chani is clipped and stunted, all of the clever exchange between them is missing, all we get to see is Kyle pawing Sean Young.It was as if they gave up halfway through production: after filming highly detailed scenes at the beginning of the film, the last half of the film was rushed through.But still, after reading Dune dozens of times, the main story is all there.David Lynch needs to revisit this film and give it a directors cut that only is available in certain Fanedits.I saw this in the theatre when it was released, it was kind of big deal back in 1984.

Within the open few scenes, they throw lots of names, locations and quarrels at you with little context. Trying to remember obscure names right off the bat was a challenge and I wasn't sure if one was a person or location as they sounded alien and mythical. Point being, they dug a hole for me that I had to work to get out of and not feel stupid. There were some unique and creative looking creatures and lands. Occasionally, the special effects looked fine for the mid-80s and other times the effects were appalling even for 1984. The pacing felt off too with several long scenes that drug on. The plot was rather typical too with a son of an important man who attempts to thwart enemies from conquering them or something all in a far future in lands of sand.

It's my favorite novel of all-time), chances are you're going to find a lot to complain about when it comes to writer/director David Lynch's controversial 1984 film adaptation. Not the minor tweaks, inevitable omissions and odd aesthetic choices, I'm talking fundamental changes to the heart and the subtext of the story. But despite this, I adore this film. Is it a good adaptation of 'Dune'? No. It's not the dropped characters, like the Fenrings, or reduced or totally omitted story lines, such as Thufar Hawat's time among the Harkonnens (Though, because it's Lynch, we do get Hawat having to milk a hairless cat). Or even the fact that the bulk of Paul's time with the Fremen is told in montage form. It's turning Paul into an actual deity, without all of the subtext of religious manipulation.But, if you choose to view the film on its own terms and in the context that Lynch presents it, I still believe it works exceptionally well as a piece of epic space opera. With some incredible design work, an amazing score (By the rock band Toto!?--with an additional track by Brian Eno!?) and a cast who absolutely inhabit their roles, 'Dune' is, in my humble opinion at least, a flawed masterpiece.",Dune

Perhaps Frank Herbert's mammoth book is simply not meant to be movie (at least not one running less than 5 or 6 hours). David Lynch tries mightily to balance Herbert's eco-philosophy with his own tilted view of the world. It's artistically stunning, occasionally rousing but too often muddled. Kyle MacLachlan is saddled with the daunting lead role and although he's gone on to quite a successful film career, he has neither the presence nor the gravitas to carry this particular film. Fortunately Lynch provides a brilliant supporting cast: Francesca Annis as Lady Jessica; bushy eye-browed Freddie Jones; Kenneth McMillan, stealing the show as the grotesque Baron Harkonnen; Dean Stockwell; Linda Hunt; Max Von Sydow. Virginia Madsen pops up as a large talking head and Sting is pretty colorful as the demented Feyd Rautha.

The music, at least some of it, is appropriately celestial, ethereal, almost subliminal in its orchestration. That said, the film's other elements are awful.The plot is an incoherent mess. I had no idea what was going on. After the first thirty minutes, I really didn't care what was going on. Character and place names confuse and irritate; they are like something from out of a witch's dictionary. The characters are uninteresting, and I could not identify with any of them. They have no sense of humor, and always seem to be in a bad mood. (Whatever happened to antidepressants?). The dialogue is heavy duty, melodramatic mumbo jumbo. The voice-over technique is overused, and is therefore irritating. The casting is poor. Kyle MacLachlan is not convincing in the role he plays, because he lacks charisma. The worms have no personality. The special effects are mediocre at best. And the film is full of cheap cinematic gimmicks, like blue eyeballs, futuristic techno-gadgets, and a floating fat man.It is a dreadfully pretentious and ponderous film that takes itself way too seriously. Even Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" has some entertainment value, derived from its technical crudeness. But, apart from portions of the soundtrack, ""Dune"" has no entertainment value of any kind. The film is cold and clammy. It has all the charm of a dead fish.",Dune
60,barnabyrudge,"Ambitious, mystical, innovative, imaginative.... and REALLY poor.",2,23 August 2005,"Obviously, Frank Herbert's novel ""Dune"" is acknowledged as a genre masterpiece and there will be people who are great fans of the book who CAN make sense of this huge-scale film adaptation. I have never read the book so my review is solely based upon the film. And unfortunately I must report that the film is terrible. Perhaps lovers of the book will tell me that transferring it to the screen was a staggeringly difficult task, and that director David Lynch should be applauded for at least attempting it. But in truth, if you come to this film with little or no knowledge of the source material, you will be left confused and frustrated by what is on offer. Sorry, but any film-maker intent on bringing a long and complex cult book to the screen should at least try to make the film accessible to all viewers. Peter Jackson did it a couple of decades later with his ""Lord Of The Rings"" films; here, Lynch simply alienates members of the audience who are NOT disciples of the book. His screenplay is muddled and very confusingly structured, and as a director he fails to coax decent performances from most of his astonishing cast.Dune is a nickname given to the planet Arrakis, a sand-covered wilderness which is the only planet in the universe where a priceless spice can be found. The spice, when harvested, enables people to travel through space and time. The planet is guarded by gigantic worm-like monsters which burrow through the sand and devour everything in their path. At the start of the story, the year is 10,191 and the universe is under the control of Emperor Shaddam IV (Jose Ferrer). Another royal family, the Atreides clan (father Leto, mother Jessica and son Paul - played respectively by Jurgen Prochnow, Francesca Annis and Kyle MacLachlan), travel to Arrakis where they learn they have been lured into a trap by their enemies. Paul and Jessica escape into the desert where they discover a huge tribe of native warriors living in the caves. The warriors believe in a long-foretold prophecy that one day a messiah will come and lead them to power.... and young Paul turns out to be that very man.The plot in synopsis-form sounds imaginative and pretty serviceable, but Lynch gets bogged down in the impossible task of setting into motion various story threads that will brings the parts together. An abundance of characters are thrust into the mix - many of them played by very fine actors - but few are introduced meaningfully. The dialogue is riddled with baffling references (presumably, if you've read the book you'll get the references) which rapidly lose the viewer. Furthermore, there is evidence that Lynch realised somewhere along the line how incoherent his story was, as many of the characters provide whispered voice-overs to convey their thoughts. While these voice-overs help - slightly! - with the audience's comprehension of what the hell is going on, it seems a clumsy and unwieldy device, probably added belatedly when the film's makers finally acknowledged what a muddled film they'd made. Some of the special effects are quite innovative, and (in isolation) certain sequences are spectacular and highly imaginative, but when viewed as a whole Dune is an utter mess of a movie.... and truly deserves its label as one of cinema's most heavily-criticised debacles.",Dune
61,kluseba,"A really solid science fiction movie, but an ordinary work for fans of David Lynch",7,2 May 2010,"I think that this movie (I have only seen the extended edition) is a really epic and entertaining one with an unique and mysterious atmosphere and brilliant acting. Especially Kyle MacLachlan is doing a great job, the special effects and graphics are really great for a film from 1984. Of course, it would have been more intense and interesting to make a trilogy about it, but the film still shows the most important elements.The only critical points are the lack of action and the weak end fight scenes and the fact that the young and brilliant director David Lynch didn't have the possibility to introduce his own and personal surreal style in this movie, especially of the short dream sequences which are nicely done. That's one of the reasons why Lynch doesn't like this movie and chose a nickname in the end as Alan Smithee to not be identified with this movie.All in all, this one is a really solid science fiction movie which presents an interesting world full of legacies and mysteries. It is more interesting than the endless Star Trek movies and more down-to-earth than the Star Wars blockbusters. This movie is something like an inside tip, so give it a chance! If you watch this film because of you're interest in the genre, you may like this one even if it is nothing extraordinary. If you watch this one because you heard that it has been directed by David Lynch and because of Kyle MacLachlan (both worked together in the weird and surreal ""Blue Velvet"", and the legendary ""Twin Peaks"" series), you may be disappointed as it is a quite ""ordinary"" and ""logical"" movie for David Lynch but it may show you that he has some special talents and does a solid job even if this is not exactly his kind of thing.",Dune

63,jaybob,I am not a 'sci-fi-'film fan BUT I did like this one.,7,19 May 2008,"As per above, I am not a fan of science fiction, I find many of these movies boring. For this reason & the bad reviews this received I did not see this film in 1984.This version is the extended 179 minute version that the director David Lynch had his name taken off of, for the idiotic reason the studio clipped some 20 seconds of an unneeded scene.We are told what happens & we see the result, I for one did not need to see an open heart.If they kept that in, the film would have gotten a PG 13 rating & not the PG proper rating.Sorry Mr.Lynch the reasoning was wrong. I found the movie to be interesting, exciting, likable & above all superbly made,I cannot find any fault with the production, Sets, costumes, music, editing make-up, etc were all award worthy, The special effects were first class & not over done like in some other films.I never read the original book, so I cannot comment on how close the screenplay was. The story is quite involved, with the clever narration all is explained very clearly & you can follow all.The story here is no different than many other space adventures.The Star War series has many of the same plot points.In this type film I would not expect superb award winning acting, Some performances here were better than others, BUT all fit the roles being presented.I was never bored, I liked nearly all the characters,even a few you were not supposed to like.Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 91 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)",Dune

Finally checked it off the list and it was an interesting experience to say the least. In short, I liked it, but this is definitely an unpolished movie that could go for a little added discipline. It's a bit all over the place, there's so much going on here and they're trying to create this whole, intricate universe in one movie and it just needs more space to do it. I'd love to see the new version set up as a trilogy, a franchise, something that really lets us explore and dive into the richness of this universe. That's where a chunk of my positivity is coming from, it's the potential. This could easily be brought up to the same stage as a Star Wars with the right team behind it and I'm hopeful for that. I suppose time will tell but at least for now we get to live with the promise and potential of the Dune that was.",Dune
65,ShootingShark,"Glorious, Brilliantly-Made, Lavishly Visual Epic Interplanetary Science-Fiction Soap-Opera / Religious Parable",8,10 August 2008,"The desert planet of Arrakis produces a precious spice called melange. Duke Atreides is given the rights to mine the spice, but this is a ruse to allow his enemy, Baron Harkonnen, to attack him. At the centre of these events is the Duke's son Paul, who appears to be the messiah of the Fremen, Arrakis' indigenous tribes, a mystical warrior who will lead them to freedom. Is Paul Atreides truly the Universe's super-being ?Dune, a magnificent movie, is a great example of why film critics should all be shot. It was a hugely ambitious project; filming an epic and much-beloved science-fiction novel set on several different planets, with dozens of characters and subplots, and a complex religious / scientific subtext. It cost an enormous amount (forty-five million dollars was reputed to be the most expensive movie budget at the time), was a massive undertaking, and everyone who worked on it did a fantastic job. Then it came out and a few pencil-necks who wouldn't know one end of a camera from another, couldn't grasp the plot and whose only means of stroking their collective egos was to agree that anything so original must be bad, all decided it was rubbish and savaged it. As a consequence it destroyed the movie's chances of success and nearly ended the careers of one of the most fearless movie moguls and one of the most talented film directors there has ever been. Don't believe a word they say. This is a terrific movie in every respect; it looks sensational, it has a fantastic cast, and the plot is engrossing, incredibly original and never confusing unless you're a congenital moron. All of the incredible landscapes and lavish visuals are realised through stunning sets and special effects (by Barry Nolan, Carlo Rambaldi, Kit West and Albert Whitlock), and Freddie Francis' photography is unforgettable. We see opulent palaces, vast deserts, mutated creatures which fold space around them, bizarre vehicles, hideous machine worlds, giant sandworms, hidden reservoirs, all bedecked in rich green and gold. Every scene is nothing short of stunning to look at. There is a great stirring score by rock band Toto, which creates an alternately beautiful / horrible atmosphere in perfect harmony with the imagery, as do all the imaginative sound effects by Lynch's key collaborator, Alan Splet. The large international ensemble are an amazing bunch of weird actors, almost the cult movie fan's dream cast. MacLachlan (in his movie debut) is excellent in the lead, carefully timing Paul's transformation from inexperienced youth to freedom fighter to messianic saviour, and his handling of the subtler scenes is remarkable, like the epiphany he has whilst hiding in the rocks from the crashed thopter. Everybody else is great in support, with particular honours to Dourif, McGill and Prochnow, but all the actors playing the crazy red-haired Harkonnens steal the movie. McMillan is unforgettable as the corpulent, hideously perverse, floating fat man, Smith plays the whole movie with a delicious maniacal laugh and Sting gives the ultimate cocky pretty-boy rockstar actor turn. Look fast too for Lynch himself in a rare acting role, as the captain of the spice harvester that gets creamed. All of these rich performances, amazing sets and evocative scenes are wonderful, but equally wonderful is the plot. Nobody ever made a good movie if the story wasn't interesting, and what is really rich about this film is the story, which is filled with fascinating archetypal characters; heroes, villains, traitors, warriors, mothers, sons. It deals with loyalty, warfare, ecology, religion, love, revenge, mysticism and transformation. It's full of profound moments; Yueh's grief over his betrayal, Paul's wonderment as his dream unfolds, Leto's words of wisdom to his son, the mental torture of the gom-jabbar test, Hawat's despair at his failure, Chani's infinite love for Paul. It's a deeply moving story, and the most unjust of the many criticisms it received is that the reviewers didn't see this. Brilliantly designed by Anthony Masters and Bob Ringwood, shot mostly in Mexico and based on the classic 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. Unhappily, it was re-edited for TV into a three-hour version Lynch disowned with the usual Alan Smithee credit; this review is of the original cut. It was also remade in 2000 as a three-part miniseries by The Sci-Fi Channel. Lynch doesn't talk about this movie because to him it was such a painful and arduous monster to make, with such an unpleasant outcome. But for me it's amongst his best work - it may not be perfect and it may have been horrific to work on but his ambition, craft and superb artistic sensibilities produced an incredible experience and a truly great science-fiction film.",Dune
66,truemythmedia,A Valiant Effort,4,29 April 2019,"In my mind, even the worst David Lynch (""Eraserhead"") film would be something that I could watch and enjoy, and as I had just finished reading Frank Herbert's amazing novel of the same name, I was eager to see one of the only adaptations available. Major events in the book were rushed over, while little details, like the importance of a jewel in one character's forehead, are given lengthy expositional explanation. Arguably, the most exciting part of the book, acts two and three, are condensed into about an hour runtime that feels so rushed its impossible to keep track of what's going on. There's a scene when the narrator quite literally just lists a string of events that happens, and in that time he probably skimmed over two hundred pages worth of great material. This movie was an abortion, and I can absolutely understand why Lynch wanted his name taken off this movie, but at the same time, I can't give this one star. Having just read the source material I know how incredibly complex this story is. This is an eight hundred page book that Lynch tried to distil down into a working two hour film, of course there will be some issues. Some of the production design for this movie was great! I thought Kyle McLaughlin, while not perfect, was a decent choice for Paul. Some of the lines from the book were used directly in the film, some of the scenes were similar to how I had imagined them, but overall it just falls apart. Its obvious Lynch loved this book as much as I do, and I appreciate the fact that he himself knows this is a failure. I will never watch this film again, but it was a very valiant effort.",Dune
67,davidmvining,Beautiful but broken,3,10 May 2021,"I hold David Lynch's Dune up as the perfect example of an adaptation done wrong. It's too concerned with capturing moments from the book to actually tell a story, and it even misses the basic point of the book on top of all that. If you're going to hire a surrealist to interpret Frank Herbert's Dune, you don't hamstring him at the script stage. You give him the money and watch to see what comes out. If you don't want to take that risk, then don't hire him. Keep the project on hold for a couple of years while Ridley Scott makes Blade Runner.The first half or so of the movie, though, is relatively coherent. Beset by an overabundance of voice over from Princess Irulan's opening monologue (that actually contains information that gets repeated twice) to little snippets from those in frame (most of which are unnecessary and captured by the performance but seem to be there in order to bring more of Herbert's work literally to the screen), we see as the House Atreides, led by Duke Leto, is moving from their home world of Caladan to the hellish desert planet Arrakis, the sole source in the known universe of mélange, Spice, from which all interstellar travel, life extension, mind expansion are derived. It's a hard, but well paying job that is displacing the House Harkonnen, the Atreides long time antagonist. This is all a plot by the Emperor of the Known Universe to allow Harkonnen to kill Duke Leto as Leto is becoming too popular in the Universe's Landsraad, it's parliament of sorts. And none of these people are the main character.You can tell, if you've never read the book or seen the movie, that this is a massively dense story with a lot of politics going on, and I haven't gotten to the ecology of the planet, the weird religious and magical cult of women called the Bene Gesserit, and the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen. There's a lot in this story, and Lynch (probably at least partially at the behest of his producer, Dino de Laurentiis) went about the exact wrong way to capture all of this.Every story is about a single thing at its core, and the story if Dune is about Paul Atreides, son of the Duke, and his journey from boyhood to manhood to leader to godhead. It's not really about the squabbling of futuristic feudal lords or breeding programs or even giant sandworms that people ride. It's about a single man's journey to being worshiped by his followers despite being just a man. That is what you have to capture first and foremost. Everything else is just detail draped on that story. The problem with that approach to adaptation is that you'll end up pissing off fans of the book who aren't getting their favorite scene or part, but you'd be adapting the story for the medium while retaining the story's thematic core and main characters.By taking the opposite approach, of trying to stuff as much from the book as humanely possible in to a grand two hour and seventeen minute runtime, absolutely nothing gets the kind of attention it needs to grow and feel natural narratively. However, everything does work best (not particularly well, but best for this film) in the first half.We see the pieces being laid out for the coming end of the first half as people explain things to each other, who everyone is, why everyone hates each other, and what's going to happen. It's kind of dull, but it works. Everything falls apart at the midway point and the attack on the Arrakeen Palace. All of the pieces have been introduced awkwardly, but they've been introduced. When everything starts smashing together, though, we have no emotional involvement and the pieces so tenuously introduced while the actual action is so incoherently pieced together that it's hard to tell what exactly is happening. For instance, the Baron Harkonnen literally just shows up in the palace in the middle of a large fight between two armies. Doctor Yueh betrays his Duke based on a couple of lines about his wife. It's also incoherently cut together on a simple technical level because it's trying to cover so much action in such a short amount of time.Then it gets even worse. By the time Paul and his mother Jessica escape the Harkonnens into the desert, an hour and fifteen minutes have progressed with less than an hour of running time left in the film. From this point four new important characters get introduced, Chani, Stilgar, Alia, and Reverend Mother Ramallo. Stilgar becomes Paul's main companion within the Fremen culture. Chani is his love interest. Alia is his sister. Ramallo is the catalyst for making Jessica a full Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit. This is a lot of stuff to shove into less than the second half of the film, and it's all competing with plot mechanics including some dense and poorly explained stuff around the Baron Harkonnen's efforts to set his nephew Feyd up as the savior of Arrakis from his other nephew The Beast Rabban (partially covered in a single line of dialogue), the Emperor needing to micromanage the situation on Arrakis because Paul is leading a revolt on the planet that is halting Spice production while the Spacing Guild is threatening the Emperor because of the situation, and Paul needs to become a full Fremen by raising an army with the Weirding Modules (one of the only designs I don't really like in the film) and riding the Sandworm for the first time. Oh, and of course there is a giant battle.I have no idea how anyone who isn't already intimately familiar with the source book could make heads or tails of this. It's so dense, thin, and underexplained that it becomes a highlight reel of events from the book instead of an actual telling of a story. It's incomprehensible.Oh, and they completely miss the point of the book. I don't usually harp on things missing the points of source material (the source material is always there, preserved, without the adaptation), but just to pile on with the movie's sins, I might as well note this. Paul should not be able to make it rain by his will alone on Arrakis. The point isn't that Paul becomes a god, but that he uses force, fear, and violence to supplant one system of power with another where the main change is that he's on top. Having him make it rain just ends up as one more incoherent choice at the end of a series of incoherent choices.Now, having savaged this film from a narrative point of view, let me talk about what I do actually like. The designs of this film are kind of amazing. The sets are huge, ornate, and simply fun to look at. The technology takes a similar approach as Terry Gilliam did in Brazil where Lynch used modern and old technology in new and interesting ways to represent the future (my favorite being the light that shines in Thufir Hawat's face that's supposed to relay computer information that he can instantly decode as a living computer, essentially). In addition, Lynch is really good with actors and pulled together an amazing cast here, so while characters may be short changed endlessly because of the movie's narrative incoherence, when individual actors are on the screen they do well.Lynch was the wrong director for a literal minded adaptation. De Laurentiis was the wrong producer for such a large undertaking since he wanted such a short end product. Adapting the entire book was the wrong decision for a two hour film. The film's not worthless, but it's so thoroughly broken on so many story levels that it's closer to a train wreck than a piece of narrative filmmaking.",Dune
68,onepotato2,Space Trainwreck,1,17 November 2006,"Dune's trip to the screen took so long and involved so much squandered effort, one feels that out of pity, you should say something positive about it. But that's almost impossible. Look no further. You've found it - one of the worst movies ever made. Anyone who voted for Ishtar hasn't seen this. This is film-making at its most inept, convoluted and stodgiest. When I first saw Dune (in its original theatrical release) there were two distinct omens; upon buying your ticket you were handed a list of terms and definitions used in the movie. Apparently the filmmakers were so worried that this weird, bookish film was such an indecipherable morass that the viewers who hadn't drank the Frank Herbert Kool-Aid would willingly consult a glossary to get back on track (you know: research!) The 2nd warning sign is the introduction to the film, clearly duct-taped on by desperate producers watching their profits evaporate, which shows Princess Irulan's (Virginia Madsen) floating head staring down the audience, didactically explaining still more obscure plot-points in positively boneheaded, stilted verbiage (with royal enunciation, ""...and oh yes, I forgot to mention, the spice is crapped in big piles by an organism that looks like a blood clot, on the planet Jargon 7"") At just the five minute mark, you have already sat through the most obtuse piece of film you ever will. Why Irulan (a fourth tier character, lost in this pile-up) is handed this ignoble task, may simply have to do with which actor was willing to come back and film additional footage for a few bucks. It's just one of thousands of questions you'll have.Moving on. The big plot point is that a privileged young man turns out to be even more privileged (with galactic implications) than he imagined; that's something you can really relate to. We all thought I was a messiah once in the third grade. As portrayed by Kyle Maclachlan, a wooden actor, Paul Atreides is unbearable, and once his true calling is revealed, he becomes even stiffer and duller. Are we supposed to like Paul because he smiles a lot?The movie is ceremonial & pompous. Characters lack an ounce of individuation, and speechify instead of relating to each other or moving the plot forward; talking in explicit meaning, as if communication and culture were only about passing parcels of information. They talk and talk and talk, and when their lips are closed they still talk via some hideous voice-overs. I'll be damned if I could tell you ten words that were important in the whole movie. Only Spawn handles language as stupidly as Dune. If you like movies to signify overt meaning literally, so that you don't have to reason things out yourself, this one's for you. Lynch (also the films author) constructs dumb illegible visuals, and forgets that a smart camera placement is worth ten pages of script. This is so non-filmic, that it's nearly impossible to believe it's a David Lynch movie. There is nothing more to say about this film except that every time it's creators make a choice it's a bad one, resulting in an utterly bewildering movie. DUNE is such a hopelessly, stupidly literal film, it easily claims a spot in my trifecta of the worst three films ever made. If you just want to see a decent escapist space opera, just rent Stargate, which is not great either, but it fails much less and has fewer pretensions than this.I really need to rent this again just for the laughs. I had almost forgotten that every line that issues from the 6 year old red-head is so poorly dubbed that I was howling.Sidenote: It's difficult to imagine how you could make Dune worse, until you see the TV version. It's so bad that David Lynch takes his name off of it. That version begins with a narrator intoning over ""courtroom artist"" quality drawings (of scenes that took place before the film started) again in an attempt to correct its flaws and frontload a codex. I think you get the idea.The best you can say about this piece of space-corn may be that it put Kyle Maclachlan in the hands of David Lynch, setting the stage for Blue Velvet, although what K.M. contributes there could have probably been done by anyone. Let's call it a draw with Twin Peaks.",Dune
69,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A Sci-Fi Epic That Needs Some Energy,5,22 December 2020,"Prior to George Lucas and the release of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), the genre of space related films had been out and about before. It just so happened that Lucas' film brought it back by popular demand. While Lucas' story was a culmination of ideas, it was still his original concept. There was however a popular story already written that was waiting to be adapted and that was Dune by Frank Herbert. With that said, who knows how it would have turned out if Lucas was in charge. For David Lynch who only directed Eraserhead (1977) and The Elephant Man (1980) before this, it seems to be clear perhaps he was not the strongest choice. That's not to say Lynch isn't a good director, but his previous projects were not in the same genre nor were they as big a production as this one. He also admits to not fighting for his vision.Having written and directed this feature probably took a toll on Lynch as well. The plot for this feature is about a planet named Arrakis AKA Dune, which has a precious commodity called ""spice"", everyone in the universe loves. On Dune where this good is sourced, are the natives who believe in a prophecy of someone freeing them and their planet from authoritarian control. The person whose plan is to inherit the current occupation of Dune is Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) the son of the Duke Leto Atreides (Jürgen Prochnow). They are not the only ones though seeking to control Dune. There's also Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (José Ferrer) who's competing with the Atreides dynasty and hopes to overthrow them with the help from Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan) and his nephews Feyd Rautha (Sting) and The Beast Rabban (Paul L. Smith). That's about as condensed as it can get.Sadly, the characters and writing suffer the worst in this science-fiction story. The characters and their respective actors mentioned above are only a small handful of those to appear in this film. There's also appearances from Brad Dourif, Richard Jordan, Virginia Madsen, Everett McGill, Dean Stockwell, Max von Sydow, Sean Young, Linda Hunt, Silvana Mangano and Patrick Stewart. The value their characters add to the picture though is average at best. With that said, it doesn't give the audience much more for the main characters. Very few of them have any kind of charm to them. It's like the tone was to take it very seriously, as the amount of light hearted moments come far and few between. As the lead star, one would think Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides would be someone to rally behind...not exactly.Really, it's the villains who expel the most energy on screen. Kenneth McMillan as the pus oozing floating fat man, as he's referenced in this film by another character, looks to be enjoying every scene that he's in. Paul L. Smith best known for his role in Robert Altman's live-action version of Popeye (1980) comes in a close second here. Sting is also grinning in several shots...whether he needs to be or not. Why are they having a good time but no one else looks like they are? The worst offense this film commits is having in almost every scene having characters perform inner monologue whispering. To its credit, it works in some cases for context purposes. However, this movie just over does it; audiences don't have to be told everything a character is thinking.Visually speaking for 1984, the film looks good. The practical effects and small assortments of digital effects are unique for their time. The greatest prop of this feature everyone remembers are the gigantic sand worms. Wonder if that helped inspire the demonic ones from Beetlejuice (1988). Helping with the visuals was Freddie Francis who also shot for Lynch's The Elephant Man (1980) and would later shoot for Glory (1989). Lastly the film score was composed by 80s icon band TOTO. While it seems to have been their only film to score by, TOTO deserves credit for creating and mixing a competent sounding tone for this futuristic movie. There are mixes of orchestra and electric guitar some would be surprised to hear actually work well off each other. Not to mention there's a main theme for the film.As grand as the look of the movie is, the stuffed screenplay, over serious tone and constant inner monologues make the experience long and boring. The special effects and music is crafted expertly, but that doesn't add much when most of the characters are bland.",Dune
70,justin-fencsak,One of the underrated 80s sci-fi gems of all time,8,7 June 2017,"When Dune first came out in theaters during the Christmas holiday season in 1984, it went with a thud due to competition from other holiday fare like Beverly Hills Cop. It also suffered from its running time which David Lynch cut from more than three hours to just around 2 hours and 20 minutes and sped up the pace of the best selling sci-fi novel by the late Frank Herbert to please young audiences who got weary of Star Wars after the last Star Wars movie the year before. Today it's now a cult classic due to its score by Toto, the casting, and the special effects which were ahead of its time for a $45 million movie that became David Lynch's highest grossing movie despite negative reviews from critics. The enduring popularity of this movie, and the franchise, has resulted in a TV miniseries as well as its sequel, and a reboot from Legendary that is being directed by the man behind Arrival.",Dune
71,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,One of those rare movies that deserves a negative rating,1,16 November 2020,"I liked the novel Dune so much that I read it twice, despite its heft.I have had trouble getting through the movie Dune even once in its entirety.But I think I have a strategy: try to get some friends together, get wasted on your preferred mind-altering substance, and treat it as camp. It might just work.Because watching it straight up is painful. The grotesque makeup. The cheap effects. The badly dubbed dialogue. The incomprehensible plot. The inert direction. The stiff acting. The sn0t-lines. The h-m0er0tic fascination with Gordon Sumner.It's actually kind of startling this movie arrived 7 years after Star Wars when it's special effects are on par with 1950s italian/greek myth movies of the sort that were mocked by Bill Murray during his SNL guest days.It's no wonder Lynch's career has basically been as a director of terrible television shows. He's a hack.",Dune
72,eric262003,Better Through Age But Inferior To Other Science Fiction Movies,6,27 December 2020,"When I first saw 'Dune"" in the theatres back I was 8 when it was first released. I was still desperate to watch more sci-fi movies long after the wrapping of ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"". I knew it in my heart at the time, that nothing would compete with the ""Star Wars"" franchise at the time, but at least I was hoping that my hunger for sci-fi movies would quench my appetite. In the end, the only thing that I got out of it was total boredom.I hadn't seen it in 36 years (man do I feel like a geriatric saying that), and after watching it again I was hoping that maybe the older adult side of me may see ""Dune"" through a different perspective. And this time all I can say was that it was an intriguing, but flawed movie that sadly failed at the box office. Maybe by today's standards it could be regarded as a ""cult classic"". It's still mundane in many areas, but at least the visuals are very stunning and I think it's very natural to see the atmosphere being messy in appearance and keeps a lot of visual details like you would expect them to be.Based off of a series of novels written in the 1960's by Frank Herbert, the thin plot is quite underwhelming. In the opening scenes we get an overdone narration from Princess Irulan (Virginia Madsen) who tells us way to much of the events going on in only a few minutes it becomes watered down and overkill. The story centres around the plant of Arrakis in the year 10191, where a spice called melange holds the distinction of the being the most powerful substance in entire universe. The young heir of Atreides clan named Paul (Kyle McLachlan) who makes it his mission to defend the Fremen's and to battle for control of his planet and to protect the spice from evil overlords like the Harkonnens led by the disfigured and ill-looking Baron Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan). There are a lot of quirky characters featured here including the Police lead singer/bassist Sting as the cunning adversary Feyd-Rautha.I'm not going to go into a blow-by-blow run through of the characters because of how dense most of them are portrayed but there are a few that stand out to some levels of vast importance. Sure we have Paul as the leading character, someone who we will be following along with through most of the movie. We have is parents the the Duke Leto Atreides (Jurgen Prochnow) and his mother, Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis) who both play important parts in their son's quest. Sean Young shines as the love interest for Paul named Chani, a fierce warrior and daughter of Planetologist Liet-Kynes (Max Von Sydow). And then there's the leading villain, the bulbous, deteriorating sickly looking Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (McMillan) (it should noted that ""Dune"" at the time was considered one of the most homophobic movies out there, just by the physical and psychologically negative stereotypes depicted in the Baron's character alone).Based on the gargantuan sized novel by Frank Herbert, adapting it to film was no easy initiative but through the effort from director David Lynch (though he regrets to this day of ever making this film) he tries to accomplish the impossible, he still didn't fully succeed. What really saves this movie from being a total train wreck is is the eye-candy visuals and the atmosphere that feels like what would have expected from Herbert's novel. The main red herring stems from the poorly executed screenplay.The acting doesn't really fare better and though we can forgive McLachlan being that it's his big screen debut here, he just seems very wooden here (though he fared better in other Lynch films like ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks""). Sting was quite weak here, but that could be forgiven due to him being a singer top priority. The least convincing performance comes from Alicia Witt's performance as Alia, not her fault in the least, she tried and it was her acting debut and was just 9 at the time. There were some great performances mostly from the supporting cast which were the likes of Patrick Stewart, Jose Ferrer, Dean Stockwell, Sian Phillips, Max Von Sydow and Everett McGill. Though McMillan's character may have been offensive, he was an entertaining villain.The soundtrack is very catchy especially from the band Toto and some brilliant song contributions from Brian Eno. The creatures were exhibited nicely from Carlo Rambaldi. There were many aspects that Lynch wanted this movie to go on a darker path, but due to his lack of creative control, he wasn't able to accomplish that. It's no wonder why he dismisses this movie so much. Though there are good aspects about this movie, it's still not enough consider this movie as a classic.",Dune
73,pc95,Scattered Mix/ Some datedness,6,15 January 2014,"Over the last several decades following ""Dune""'s release, I've caught portions of this movie several times, so decided to check it out on DVD in it's entirety, the 137 min version. It is certainly a 'mixed bag' of a movie. Directed by David Lynch, the way the movie is all over the place, you can tell that the studio chopped it up, and some old quotes from Lynch seem to confirm that as there is a 3+ hr version apparently. Not that it would've greatly improved, but I thought the movie had a pretty good narrative. However the introduction was cluttered. A friend of mine said the book it's based off of was uber-detailed and not easy to follow. Perhaps this affected putting together the movie. I like the music until the rock-guitars started coming with the worms making it feel ridiculously dated. The effects were anywhere from adequate to awful - taken the movie's age into account 0 maybe good to poor would be fair. I liked some of the execution with the worm scenes - strong SCIFI. The costumes and sets were inventive and interesting. The acting was mostly satisfactory - Kyle McClaughlin did pretty well in his debut. The movie was ambitious, but didn't make it to it's potential. It felt disjointed and some scenes rushed or not well explained. Worth a look though, but keep a lid on your expectations. 6/10",Dune

But still, a mess. I don't totally blame David Lynch. He really went for it and brought a version of Dune to the screen that tried to be faithful to the novel. But it's incredibly hard to translate something as complex and epic as Dune to film. This is a story that works better when your imagination brings it to life. Your vision of a Guild Navigator, the revolting Baron, or the opulence of the Emperor's court is bound to eclipse the cheesy and low-budget (in appearance, at least) sets, costumes, and special effects of Dune. Some flaws can directly be laid at Lynch's feet, though. The tone  of the movie is often wildly over-the-top and absurd and the casting is questionable, at best. Good try, but this adaptation doesn't work.",Dune
75,bkrauser-81-311064,"Contrived Yet Shallow, Busy Yet Boring",3,17 April 2012,"Based on a cult science fiction novel and directed by cult director David Lynch, ""Dune"" is one of those films that appeals to a very narrow group of people. Those outside the closely knit circle of fans i.e. those who haven't read the Frank Herbert novel are simply not on its wavelength. Cults after all are exclusive.I haven't read ""Dune"" so naturally I didn't like the movie adaptation. My understanding of the novel is that it's so complex and descriptive that David Lynch's original cut was four hours long. After being a pretty sizable box-office bomb, so many different versions of ""Dune"" were released on home video that according to some fans watching each is like watching completely different movies. I'm not sure which cut I got, all I know is it was a muddled misshapen mess. Something about a prophecy, political maneuvering between feudal dukes and the possession of a ""spice"" that can allow trans-navigation throughout the universe. Not to baffle intergalactic parlance but if it can make you jump through time and space (not to mention see Captain Jean-Luc Picard) its not a spice its a drug.Evidently the makers of this ""Lawrence of Arabia"" meets ""Avatar"" sci-fi epic were tripping major balls because even if all the awkward story arcs were smoothed over, you'd be left with a very frightening looking movie. Disturbing images include a sadistic, pustule-ridden flying man, a graphic birthing scene, gigantic desert worms being ridden by desert dwelling nomads, and a half-naked Sting. It was like walking into a H.R. Giger painting during a bad acid trip. In addition, everyone, and I mean everyone's inner monologue chimed in with unnecessary commentary and lugubrious exposition. My guess is the actors' voices were plugged in during post-production in a half-baked attempt to make the movie more comprehensible. contrived yet shallow, busy yet boring, ""Dune"" is too big of a mess for me.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Dune

When I watch this film, I usually start the DVD about 30 minutes in. Too many confusing characters. A waste of such magnificent acting talent and special effect artists' work. Even on a big screen TV, the landscapes look cheap, dark, and murky. The 190 minute TV version is far too long, but at least you get to see more of the excellent ""creature work"" by the creator of ""E.T"". You would never know that there were over 4,000 costumes, huge, intricate sets, and sweeping landscapes. It somehow just doesn't translate well to the home ""screen"". A murky and grainy video transfer by Universal doesn't help. The Mad Baron is just too disgusting and weird. ""Sting"" is incredibly skinny. Everybody is supposed to be weakened from extended ""spice"" use, but it comes off as Homophobic instead! The ""Emperor Worm"" (an amazing ""puppet"") is fascinating, but it is barely seen in the original short 138 min. version. The special effects look very crude, except for the ""fighting shield"". The expensive sets look really bad. As presented, it's an Allegory for everything from evil, corrupt governments, to drug dependence, to the Coming of the Savior. It's ""PG-13"" rating is due to violence and gore. The ""Mysticism"" hard to understand. Maybe more under-dressed maidens would have helped, as much as I hate to admit it. Sure, it has a rousing climax, but, overall, it's too little too late to save the picture. By this time, nobody really cares when it finally rains on ""Dune""! They just want to leave the room!

79,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,An interesting slice of cinematic history that doesn't live up to David Lynch's best works.,6,17 April 2019,"Dune is a fascinating beast of a movie that was riddled with production troubles well before the cameras got even close to rolling a single frame of 35mm celluloid; it was in production before Star Wars but IT in turn influenced Star Wars in terms of production, story and scope. So how did the film adaptation turn out considering it was in development since the early 1970s? Well, David Lynch finally got to direct the film but was denied 'final cut privilege' for the movie by the producers: and the end product suffered greatly from this. It's not unwatchable (it's got some great shots contrasted by HEAVY exposition) but it's a film frustrated with itself for not being something greater than it could have been.Dune takes a classic book from 1966 and brings the 80s Hollywood extravaganza niche to the project: for the most part it's watchable but it's far from perfect. Star Wars already drained the core elements from its source material: the Bene Gesserit (The Jedi and The Force), the Empire (Galactic Empire), and even the Spice Melange (the Spice Mines of Kessel) were used as leverage for the original Star Wars movie. That's the trouble with adapting longstanding literature: the story may cover things other movies have since explored in their own inspired way.Is Dune a decent movie? Yes. Is it flawless? Heavens no, but its historic significance in undeniable in the face of cinema itself. Is it bad? No; but it's not particularly great either.Dune gets 3/5 stars. It's a fair space-opera romp that is sure to be watched by all devote Star Wars fans out there, because without the book the franchise probably would never have been a thing in the first place.",Dune

81,mstomaso,Dune's Devil in David's Details,7,9 April 2007,"My review covers both versions of Dune, the 2 hour release and the extended 3 hour ""Smithee"" version aired on television. The first cut of the film was over four hours long, but there was never any intention to release this, and Lynch himself shot scenes which consolidated the final product into a more manageable length.Allen Smithee, a protest pseudonym adopted by Lynch when he disassociated himself with the 3 hour version of this film, is also alluded to in Lynch's latest film - Inland Empire. A portion of a film studio in Inland Empire is ""Smithee's Room"" - a metaphorical insight into Lynch's feelings about Dune, and studio-controlled film-making in general.Given the tremendous investment made by the studio, Lynch's general distaste for the final product, the repetitive cliché soundtrack, and the occasionally bizarre use of voice-over narrative in the TV version, it seems more a DeLaurentis film than a Lynch film. Although I am very interested in Lynch's films and other projects, I am evaluating this solely from my own perspective. Despite the great director's poor opinion of this film, I enjoyed it and it is one of my favorite sci-fi films. Frank Herbert, author of the novel upon which it is based, approved the theatrical version, but he had the benefit of knowing what he was going to see. If you haven't read the book, these films can be somewhat difficult to understand. And if you come to the experience expecting something like Star Wars, you should probably find something else to do.The soundtrack is repetitive and only interesting the first time you hear the film's major theme (the Eno composition). The use of rock orchestration simply does not work in this film. Happily, Lynch learned from the experience and used rock instrumentation beautifully in later films (especially Wild at Heart and Lost Highway). The camera work is generally less inspired than the rest of Lynch's portfolio. There are occasional visually striking scenes which will remind you of the film's origin, but there are too many static shots - especially during the action scenes. The soundtrack is easy to explain - like the inclusion of Sting in the cast - this is a marketing move by the production company, not a creative choice of the director. The camera work is much less easily explained. Perhaps Lynch was asked to avoid doing anything surreal or bizarre with this film (sort of like asking Groucho Marx to avoid being funny), or the studio was trying to appeal to fans of Star Wars by simplifying and sterilizing its story.The recently released special edition DVD reveals some very interesting aspects of the production. Lynch's influence, not surprisingly, is best explored in the short documentary concerning the film's design. As an artist, Lynch spent a great deal of time and energy envisioning the material culture  both historical and modern  of each culture depicted in the film, helping to create a consistent and unique characterization for each. This spilled over quite naturally into costume design. The sets and costumes used in this film are really spectacular. The special effects, often derided by contemporary viewers, required a great deal more effort that the synthetic art of today's computerized extravaganzas and, the documentary concerning their production on the DVD is also appropriately respectful.What you will see is an intense visualization of several, fully realized alien cultures whose art, architecture and general heritage are as well realized, if not more so, than in Herbert's epic novel. To fully appreciate this, don't just check out the extras on the DVD, turn down the sound and just watch the sets, costumes, and effects move through each scenes. There is, as with Lynch's entire portfolio, a great deal to be seen. And the acting and direction are fine throughout the film.The longer version fleshes out the stories, themes and intricate subplots of Herbert's book more thoroughly, and maintains a much steadier pace than the cinematic release. Even so, both films, to some extent, suffer from too much story, overwhelming visualization, and a un-Lynchian frenetic pace. The later TV mini-series by the sci fi channel does a better job of telling the story in its entirety, but runs about 246 minutes and does not compare to the original in terms of design. Lynch's cinematic release, by contrast, rushes through components of the book and often feels inconsistent in pace.PLOT: Dune is the story of Paul ""Muad'ib"" Atreides, the son of Duke Leto Atreides the Just and his Bene Jesserat concubine Lady Jessica. Combining aspects of fantasy, sci-fi and anthropology, the story follows young Paul through a series of tragedies which find him seeking redemption for an entire galaxy by leading an adoptive tribal culture to a revolutionary cleansing of the malignant imperial system from which he sprung. The plot is exceedingly complex  in both Lynch versions of the film much is left out of Herbert's original work. Subplots abound, but, true to form, Lynch avoids short-cuts as much as possible and attempts to show his audience what is going on rather than resorting to a great deal of voice-over narrative in the theatrical release. The TV version, however, attempts to provide even more detail, and uses voice-over to patch up the areas glossed over by Lynch's script.SUMMARY: If you're a Lynch fan and not a big Herbert fan or you don't have a great deal of patience, see the cinematic release. It is the class of the lot.If you haven't read the book, or you are a Herbert purist who will accept only what was written, choose the Sci-Fi Channel version (review forthcoming soon) - but be forewarned - it is very long.If you want something that compromises between story and cinematic artistry, go for the TV version. The weakest link, but still OK.",Dune
82,classicalsteve,Gut-Wrenching Cinematic Dismemberment of an SF Classic: One of the Worst Film Adaptions of an SF Novel,2,29 April 2017,"""Dune"" the novel is possibly the greatest science fiction novel ever written and this film will go down as one of the worst in SF film history. Even with a large budget, David Lynch and company managed to gut everything beautiful and compelling about ""Dune"". Although the sets and costumes were reasonably good much of the look and effects of ""Dune"" were disastrously disappointing, and the film lacked the charm and wit of other SF offerings, such as Star Wars, not mention lacking the spectacular vision of Herbert's original novel.The setting is one of the most complex ever devised in a science fiction novel. The known ""galaxy"" is made up of noble houses which seem very similar to the Italian city-states of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance. The House Atreides is the focus of the story. At the story's beginning the House of Atreides has been ruling a lush water planet Caladan. However, now upon a command of the Emperor, Atreides has been assigned to take over the desert planet Arrakis. Arrakis is a mostly desolate desert planet nicknamed ""Dune"" with only one vital commodity. Arrakis is the only place in the known galaxy where the spice mélange can be mined and harvested. Mélange offers not only sensational properties to those who consume it, but it contains healing and even life-prolonging attributes. It is the most coveted commodity in the galaxy. However, the spice is difficult to harvest, not only because of the bitter climate of the desert, but large sand worms with maws the size of Star Trek's the Doomsday Machine and about the length of four 747's. They tend to be attracted by the mining equipment used to harvest the spice.The House Atreides moves to Arrakis where the Emperor forced the evil and immoral House Harkonen to abandon their residence. Harkonen was abusing the spice trade not allowing the spice to ""flow"" to other parts of the galaxy without hefty inflated prices. While the Emperor doesn't entirely trust House Atreides, he feels the spice trade will prosper better under the direction of Atreides. The main family consists of Duke Leto I Atreides, the current head of the House Atreides, his son Paul Atreides, and his concubine Lady Jessica, mother of Paul.Infuriated by their forced exodus from Arrakis, Baron Vladimir Harkonen has vowed revenge against House Atreides. He desires to subdue House Atreides and reclaim possession of Arrakis. The plot essentially surrounds the conflict between House Atreides and House Harkonen and their battle for the fate of the Dune planet. Paul Atreides begins to hear of a prophecy, a messiah who will come to Dune from out-world and save the Fremin, the main people of Dune.Hollywood film executives thought David Lynch was the most appropriate director for the project. (Ridley Scott was the first choice but booked for ""Blade Runner"".) Problems were apparent going in. Lynch had never directed a science fiction film before, he was not really a science fiction enthusiast, and he had never read the original novel. The end-product was one of the worst disasters in both film history and cinematic science fiction. Not only was it a terrible film which didn't do justice to Herbert's novel, it bombed miserably at the box office.First off, the script was very confusing. While there are a lot of characters in the novel, it would have behooved the project to focus only on Paul Atreides and his immediate family and the baddies the House Harkonen. Only someone who really knew and understood the novel thoroughly would be able to follow the script. Films of this sort can't be targeted only to readers of the novel, and thee were too many disjointed scenes. To give the film a few positives, the casting was pretty good, and Kyle MacLachlan was a good choice for Paul Atreides. However, the acting didn't seem quite up to Herbert's material.Even given the large budget, some of the special effects looked cheap and silly. The sand-worms didn't come off as menacing as they do in the book. These are supposed to be the equivalent of sand sharks but the film made them seem more like woolly mammoths with long tales. The filtered look of the film itself was also much to be desired. For the entire film, I thought I was trapped in a sandstorm. Yes, I understand it's a desert planet, but even a desert planet should be made to look beautiful and inviting which is often part of the point of SF, again another reason David Lynch was probably not the best choice to direct it. Even the cover art of the first edition of ""Dune"" shows some green.The film was also needlessly violent. The biggest blunder of the entire project was the portrayal of Baron Vladimir Harkonen, the equivalent of Darth Vader. While Darth Vader was certainly evil and menacing, Vader was never insufferable. Vader was also regarded as one of the best baddies in SF cinema, maybe the best ever. The Baron was portrayed so disgustingly insufferable, I didn't want to watch him. Herbert does describe him as overweight, but not disgusting. Lynch decided to portray him as a revolting and sickening blob of flesh with skin melting like wax. Who wants to watch such a horrid thing? Every time the Baron entered a scene, I wanted to look away. By contrast, the SF Channel's rendition is much more palpable. He's already an insufferable character; the filmmakers didn't have to add to the character's baddiness by making him so revolting I almost wanted to lose my lunch.Overall one of the biggest mistakes in SF film history. Lynch's ""Dune"" is not even as entertaining as ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"". It's a humorousless, pointless, and unentertaining two hours of your life you'll never get back. And it had no heart, and that's the tragedy of this film. It had some of the look and feel of the novel, but none of its heart.",Dune
83,KnightsofNi11,"Not horrible, but very underwhelming",6,7 February 2011,"There'e a lot of things that could have been great about David Lynch's science fiction cult classic, but for me it seemed to miss the mark. This film is an adaptation from Frank Herbert's novel set in the far distant future where the universe is controlled by he who controls the spice. The spice is necessary for interstellar travel and is only available for harvest on one planet. Various factions in the universe battle for control of this planet. One planet is Atreides. Atreides currently controls Arrakis, the spice planet. That is until the Harkonenns take them over. Paul Atreides, son of the ruler of Atreides, barely escapes the Harkonnen takeover and while he hides out he eventually discovers himself to be a prophet and god like figure who will save the universe from oppression. My synopsis really doesn't do this film justice, but hopefully you get the idea.Dune is arguably David Lynch's most technically ambitious project ever. This is indeed an epic scale sci-fi picture, and Lynch's visuals provide for some of the most gorgeous and grandiose scenery imaginable. It was this that would lead the film to its eventual downfall when it only grossed 27 million dollars from its 45 million dollar budget. Since then it has risen to cult status, as have most of Lynch's films. The man himself is something of a cult icon. But anyways, as a viewer who isn't concerned with box office grosses of a film from the 80's, I really enjoyed the visuals. In fact they were probably the best thing about the movie for me. However, their impressive quality does sort of slope downwards as the movie goes along, simply because I began to lose interest in the film altogether. But there's no denying that Lynch's twisted visual eye is rife throughout this film. Dune even has a surreal quality to it at times, making it almost a Blue Velvet in space.Dune should have been incredible. It should have been utterly mindblowing. But sadly it falls short and ends up being a little lackluster. The film has a great exposition. The first act of the film sets the stage for a marvelous sci-fi epic that covers realms of political corruption, urbanization, new world order, and other kinds of social critiques. But as the film goes on I just started feeling less and less amazed by the film. It kept getting less and less interesting and more just... meh. I don't want to say I started strongly disliking the film, I just stopped enjoying it as much. There isn't really a more appropriate word for the film other than lackluster. There's nothing in this film that irritated me, I was simply just not impressed. And by the end, which felt a little abrupt and hurried, I was very underwhelmed. I don't feel like I will remember this film in a week or two because there just isn't a lot to say about it.I've read that this film deserves second chances if you are as underwhelmed as I was the first time. As with most Lynch films there's a lot more underneath the film's surface. I didn't pick up on any of this and all I got out of the film was a pretty lame science fiction story that definitely had the visuals to impress and amaze, but couldn't keep my interest up. Dune had potential, but it fell short for me. As seems to be the case with every Lynch film I watch, I expect repeated viewings in my future, and perhaps my opinion will shift when those viewings come. But for now Dune does nothing too special for me.",Dune

86,cchase,"""Desert-Planted""...",8,12 February 2006,"Much like the books of J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis, Frank Herbert's series garnered a sizeable and feverishly dedicated audience from the very beginning. When I heard that it was finally about to be made into a film, I ran out and got the first book. It took me about a week to read, and another to digest it all. The richly detailed, heady scenario of strange people, weird flora and fauna and terrestrial similarities to Earth set in a far distant future, completely captured and astounded me.But not nearly enough as the very idea that someone would be crazy or ballsy enough to dream of turning it into a movie. Take a science fiction/fantasy series, whose first novel alone is large enough to cause blunt-force trauma if you dropped it on someone's head, and cram every nuance of Herbert's epic tome of geopolitical and theological intrigue, betrayal, corruption and redemption into TWO HOURS? Good freakin' LUCK. It would never work.And for ten years after its initial publication, directors of every stripe from Alejandro Jodorowsky (EL TOPO) to Ridley Scott (ALIEN), as much as they admired and obsessed over the project, all finally admitted defeat. It would require a six hour movie at least to take a MODERATELY satisfactory stab at a project, whose end product could never truly satisfy all of the meticulous fans who were members of the DUNE cult.But then came expansive producer of the mega-blockbuster, Dino De Laurentiis. And with him, everyone's favorite geek-auteur, David Lynch.Did they truly succeed in taming the wild Herbert-born beast? Yes and no. Yes, in that not only did they get the blessing of the late author as the laborious, protracted work began on pre-production, but they did manage to get the damn thing off the ground, which others had never managed to do.And no, in that Lynch still did not capture all of the odd splendor and power of the tale, mostly because he wasn't allowed to, if you know of the famously antagonistic relationship that he and De Laurentiis shared with the studio backing the movie, Universal. Like THE HOBBIT and THE RINGS TRILOGY, it certainly helps a lot more if you have read the source material. Even so, you still feel at times like you need to keep a glossary of terms and a cheat sheet handy, just as insurance against getting lost in all the myriad details.For those who have no intention of ever going near DUNE, CHILDREN OF DUNE or any of the many sequels, a quick guide for getting ""desert-planted."" This is not a Tale of Two Cities, but of four planets:Planet Caladan, home to the ""good guys"" of House Atreides: Duke Leto (Jurgen Prochnow), his longtime concubine and companion, the Lady Jessica (the radiant Francesca Annis), his son, Paul (Lynch's alter-ego Kyle MacLachlan) and the Duke's most trusted advisors, Thufir Hawat (Freddie Jones), a ""mentat"" or trained human computer who can figure out all sorts of complex equations just by intense concentration; Guerney Halleck (a much younger Patrick Stewart) and Duncan Idaho (the late, great and underused Richard Jordan).Next is Planet Giedi Prime, home to the really, REALLY bad guys in House Harkonnen: Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (a pestilently, OTT Kenneth McMillan); his own mentat, Piter De Vries (Brad Dourif), and his unctuous nephews Beast Rabban (Paul Smith) and Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Sting).Planet Kaitan is the home of the ruling emperor, Shaddam IV (Jose Ferrer) where he resides with his daughter, Princess Irulan (Virginia Madsen). In order to maintain a controlling grip over the two houses constantly at odds with each other, the Emperor keeps a reluctant alliance going with several duplicitous, interested groups, among them the Bene Gesserit, a mysterious and ominous order of psychically powerful nuns, presided over by the imperious Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, (Sian Phillips.) But the main source of all the drama and turmoil lies on the Planet Arrakis, aka DUNE, the ""desert planet."" The entire universe practically runs on what Dune offers - the precious mineral known as ""spice"" or ""melange."" As you will hear often, ""he who controls the spice, controls the universe,"" and that is what everyone, from the Emperor to the warring Houses to the Bene Gesserit, is after. And not surprisingly, Dune holds yet another internationally diverse cast of characters determined to stop them.And then it gets even more complicated than that, what with a strange prophecy that may or may not be a myth, about a ""One True Being"" (sound familiar?) who can unlock the mystery of where spice comes from, and by doing so, bring unity to all the fractured worlds.So you can see how any director, let alone Lynch, would have their work cut out for them. To his credit, he masterfully achieves with DUNE exactly what any movie is supposed to do - transport the audience to another world for two hours, (and DUNE is almost three in its original form). But be warned: Lynch has taken his own liberties with details and story lines, adding his own quirky and unique touches in the places where a lot of Herbert's concepts either couldn't be used, or had to be excised for time constraints.Part of the reason that DUNE has gotten such a bad rap over the years, is because like the book, the audience actually has to PAY ATTENTION, which is more of a European than an American philosophy for making movies. But if you give it half a chance, and you're not a die-hard Herbert purist, you will find that making an investment in this film is surprisingly more rewarding than you would ever expect.And yes, that's even with a score by Toto (with assists by Marty Paich, Allyn Ferguson, Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois), which isn't half as bad as you might think - exactly like the film itself.",Dune
87,russem31,A muddled epic,7,1 December 2005,"This is the type of film which has epic proportions and nearly succeeds - hence a ""muddled epic."" It has great acting, especially by Patrick Stewart (one of my favorite actors), great production design, and a wonderful score by Toto. However, the film should have been much longer (like the miniseries in 2000 of the same name) and the fact it was the length it turned out to be makes character development nearly impossible and the storyline very confusing. It could have been that much better. That said, it still is a muddled epic and I do recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Dune series (the best in the Dune series to date is the TV movie Children of Dune).",Dune
88,bellino-angelo2014,Probably David Lynch's weirdest movie and still a mixed bag to this day,6,10 August 2020,"To this day David Lynch's DUNE is considered a mixed bag, so a movie loved by many and hated by many. And there are also ones like me who considers it a bit of a mess (even though I have never read the book).The movie is about Paul Atreides's (Kyle MacLachlan in his film debut) journey for avenging his family, destroyed by baron Arkonnen. Along the way there are lots of cameos by many famous faces of those years (including Max von Sydow, Linda Hunt, Jurgen Prochnow, Sean Young, Virginia Madsen, Brad Dourif, Police's frontman Sting, Dean Stockwell, Josè Ferrer and even a then unknown Patrick Stewart - when he still had hair), lots of special effects (including the famous scene of the sand worms) and many typical David Lynch-esque scenes.The problem with this movie is that at times is incredibly slow. And it doesn't even want to belong to a specific cathegory. It's not a masterpiece nor absolute garbage, but it falls somewhere in between. With such a cast full of many talented actors and being based on a great book, how it could have been so wrong? Well, the special effects are too many and at times they seem more important than the plot and the actors seem wasted as the special effects go by. And at times, the David Lynch-esque scenes are at times pretty gross and sick (like when Sting removes Freddie Jones' nipple... a scene so disgusting that I felt queasy while watching it!) and it makes this movie look like David Lynch's vanity project. It could have been so MUCH better given the budget and the cast involved.In substance, not a wretched movie by all means nor a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but just a fine example of what can happen when you try to cram a complex book in one movie of only more than two hours! However if there isn't the lockdown again on December a new version of DUNE will come out with Timothee Chalamet as Paul Atreides and many other famous actors of these days. I really hope that it's much better than this version.FYI: The remake of DUNE with Timothee Chalamet has been moved to October 2021 following the moving of the release dates for the new 007 and the new FAST & FURIOUS. I have seen other new trailers and I have to admit it, it will be BETTER than this version!",Dune

90,Snootz,"Amazing graphics, horrid script and directing",3,4 November 2019,"DUNE is a train wreck in slow motion. There is no denying the amazing sets, costuming and special effects. In this it is unique and brilliant. And that's where the brilliance stops.Take one of the most original and creative novels in all of science fiction and turn it into some of the worst space opera ever written, and we have Dune. The lines are corny, the directing inexcusably poor, and the acting something out of a school play, but without the charm.Add to that train wreck a second train, a slaughtered cattle hauler and a huge septic tank and we have a movie full of needless and useless sickening scenes, absurd departures from the novel, and amateurish presentation. The Baron is a pain to even look at. There is no excuse in ""he's meant to be""; the director replaced proper character portrayal with shock schlock. There are so many terrible character portrayals it's difficult to pick the worst.We start with opening narrative lines of ""Oh yes, I forgot to tell you..."" and it goes downhill from there. The first spoken words of Chani (""I would not have let you harm my people""-- fully-mouthed. every. syllable) scream forced dialog and bad directorial micro-managing. The presentation of Brad Dourif's Mentat character Piter is hands down one of the worst I've ever seen... so extremely bad I can't tell whether it was the actor, director or a combo of both who were responsible for his ridiculous hand gestures and overly punctual speech. We've seen B-class fan films with better character presentation.To list the numerous flaws in this movie would require a novel of its own. While it is visually stunning, the writers and directors should be banned from the industry for slaughtering one of the greatest sci fi novels of all time. There comes a point when murder of a book might be considered criminal activity. If such should ever occur, this film would be prime evidence.",Dune
91,perfectbond,Not a very interesting movie,6,25 January 2003,"I should preface my commentary by saying I haven't read the Frank Herbert novel on which this film was based. I would have to say that Dune was an extremely dull movie. It was a struggle to sit through. I just couldn't lose myself in the fantasy that was being presented. The story was supposed to take place in 10091 or so but the technology displayed in the film seemed too primitive to be from that time period. I also thought the dialogue was ridiculously grandiose and pretentious. I suppose the special effects were good for their time but they look awfully dated today, much worse than the Star Wars and Star Trek movies released around this time. I can't recommend this film unless you are a fan of the novel. It was just too boring. 5.5/10.",Dune

93,tomimt,Flawed gem,7,7 October 2006,"David Lynch's 'Dune' adaptation is an oddity among movies. A big budget sci-fi movie directed by a man who is usually seen as avantgarde director, not a blockbuster entertainer. And the truth is, that 'Dune' is as far from 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones' as Pluto is from the Sun.I like the film and I hate it for some extent. I love the atmosphere and the settings but I hate the way the story is told, because that is the only major problem within this film. The way the story is told is the major obstacle that prevents 'Dune' to be a great film.The settings used for the worlds of Dune and the home planets of the Atreides and Harkonnen are all different and cleverly designed. Atreides family lives in a planet with roaming oceans while the Harkonnen live in a green industrial hell, suitable for their almost camp like insanity. The Dune itself is a hot, desolate planet filled with sand, fremen and gargantuan worms. The special effects work reasonably well when placed against the modern special effects. They are aged of course, but not to the point of laughable. Time has been rather kind. Especially the sand worms are very well made.As I said I dislike how the story is told: the movie is just too short and that is far too visible from all the scenes filled with characters thinking or a narrator explaining what has happened during some period of time. The biggest favour producer De Laurentiis could have done with the story would have been to break it down in the middle and do a another movie out of the rest. Now we only have a colleague of the major events that happened, but not a thing in between to tie them together in between.AS the 'Dune' is a David Lycnh movie it also has a lots of segments that clearly are creation of David Lynch. There is a lot of dream like quality in the film and the insanity of house Harkonnen is so over the top that it is almost camp like. The perverted nature of Vladimir Harkonnen is almost unintentionally funny.Before the end I have to give a special note about the soundtrack of the film. Toto has done very nice job with the music and some of the songs belong among the best movie music ever recorded.",Dune

95,anselmdaniel,An ambitious adaptation,6,27 October 2018,"This review contains spoilers.Dune premiered in 1984 and is directed by David Lynch, The movie is adapted from a book series of the same name written by Frank Herbert and published in 1965. The screenplay is by David Lynch. The movie is set in the far future where humanity has colonies across the stars. On a desert planet called Arrakis, a drug known as spice is produced. During this time, a conflict emerges between the various houses of the space empire.Dune is a movie that garners mixed feelings. There are good things about this movie. The main positive is its rich backstory being reflected well in the adaptation. I could feel that there are a lot of elements in this movie that had history behind it. The things that come to mind are the drug known as spice, the Spacing Guild, Fremens, and Bene Gesserits. These are reflected in the plot and screenplay. The movie is also well directed. This movie does not utilize the same David Lynch techniques as Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive, or Lost Highway. Dune is a much more grounded movie in its direction. The movie is also simple to follow with much, of the story being simple. The actors do a good job generally. The highlights here are Francesca Annis, playing Lady Jessica, Kyle MacLachlan, playing Paul Atreides and Kenneth McMillan, playing Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. These actors do a good job with the roles they are given.What the movie does not do well outweigh the positives. The effects of this movie have not aged well. The green screen in this movie is apparent as the movie closes on its run-time. The later scenes with the sand worms have this apparent green screen to them. Thankfully it does not detract from the movie much but it is a sign that the movie has not and will not age well. The shields that the characters employ are also poor in the quality of the special effects.The main problem with the Dune movie is its plot and lack of world explanation. The characters have an established relationship with the world and this is not explained at all in the movie. This movie would fare better with audiences that have read the books and understand them. I am not one of those people. There is minimal exposition which can be seen as a good thing by some audiences.Despite the movie's flaws. I would still recommend Dune. The movie can be a fun flick for most audiences.Grade: B",Dune

97,TalesfromTheCryptfan,One big expensive sci-fi trainwreck!,4,15 June 2014,"In the year 10,191 there stands a desolate desert planet known as Arrakis (a.k.a. Dune) where it has a precious substance that is made and sold throughout the universe as a substance called spice. A prince named Paul Artedis (Kyle MacLachen) lives on planet Calidan where his father Duke Leto Artedis (Jurgden Prochnow) has been assigned by the ruler of the galaxy known as Pasaha Emperor Shaddam IV (Jose Ferrer) to have him, Paul and wife Lady Jessica (Francesa Annis) to be on planet Arrakis to help out on spice manufacturing. However on planet Geidi Prime, overweight floating villain known as Baron Vladmire Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan) who controls the Harkonnen empire wants to fight against the Emperor and the Duke so he can take over the planet Arakkis for his evil purposes. Once on Arakkis, trouble begins to brew for Paul and friends as the Harkonnens are trying to overthrow them leaving Paul's father to die, Paul and his mother are left in the dangerous desert where the giant sandworms roam but rescued by an underground tribe of Freman warriors. He also finds true love with native girl Chani (Sean Young) as for 2 years the Fremen with new messiah or Kwistaz Haderech is what they call it to fight against the spice miners with the Baron and Emperor to save the planet's resource of spice.One of my least favorite movies of all time and one of the biggest fiascoes in the history of film plus the worst film of Lynch's career! Dune is one of my favorite books of all time as Frank Herbert created a visionary masterpiece of a novel in 1965 as well as a book franchise to make a legacy. This movie took 15 years in the making as originally Alejandro Jorodowsky who is a very good art-house director from Chile is a fan of the novel and has a great concept to make a 5 hour film based on the novel with an ideal cast like Orson Welles to having Pink Floyd do the music score but it was dropped. In 1979 Dino De Laurentiis Studios obtained the rights to the book as he approached Ridley Scott to direct after the success of ""Alien"" as Scott was interested for he is a true fan of the novel but due to a death in the family he passed out on the project in 1980 when he was gonna do ""Blade Runner"", but after the success of ""The Elephant Man"" they hired well known cinematic artist David Lynch who had major success with that film just didn't know about the book or never read it nor is he a Sci-fi kind of guy until he read the book for a month and wrote the script.What could have been a triumph turned into a major disaster! This movie cost $47 million and is one of the most expensive movies in film history. 2 years in the making of this movie and was released on December 14 of 1984 after major hype even from fans of the brilliant novel, this Science Fiction fantasy movie had potential but it turned out to be a major disaster as a film, at the box-office and critics. In theaters, the studios made them hand out pamphlets or cheat-sheets on the plot, terminology and characters of the film as it's one of the few movies in history to use cliff-notes and that was not a good sign. Audiences go to movies to escape from literacy and even from homework but it's a bad thing to give your audience an exam.Despite co-stars like Paul Smith (Popeye), Dean Harry Stockton, Patrick Stewart Freddie Jones, Linda Hunt, Chucky himself Brad Douriff and Max Von Sydow, you know what went wrong on this project? first off, Lynch never cared about the book for he just made a 2 hour bastardization of Herbert's vision with disgusting material that he added like heart- plugs, bloody fetuses, a cat/mouse sewn together like something out of The Human Centipede and his taste for the bizarre/macabre. Some of the casting was mixed as some were good like Paul Smith as Beast Rabin but some were bad like wooden first timer Kyle Maclachen and Sting, i mean come on? Sting for Feye? give me a break! some of the visual effects are laughable despite some few good ones like the worms or the Guild Navigator, the story is way too confusing even for hardcore fans of the novel such as myself and annoying overdoses of whispering voice overs which is terrible but not like Blade Runner which wasn't too bad to use v.o. in the theatrical cut of that masterpiece. I also hated how he turned the baron into a zit-faced joker of a fat-man than a serious overweight and intelligent politician for he was over-the-top and overacted, but Patrick Stewart was pretty good despite being in the wrong part when he could have been The Emperor.The film does have a few good points like that score by Toto/Brian Eno as it's one of the rare cases where the soundtrack is superior to the film itself, David Lynch disowned this movie since 1989 as he loathes the film as much as any true fan of the book does for it wasn't worth the print it was on film as Hollywood learned it's lesson to never hire David Lynch for big budget projects again to leave him do his own stuff which he did Blue Velvet in 1986 as he thankfully returned to independent films. Big budget Hollywood blockbusters just isn't his thing especially this poorly written, poorly acted, miscasted and poorly directed dreck.Yet the good thing about this movie version of Dune is that it makes you wanna read or reread the book, otherwise it's a $47 million mess.",Dune
98,WriterDave,Interesting Lynch Folly,7,31 August 2003,"On the heals of his ""Elephant Man"" masterpiece, Lynch was handed a task that was at the time as big a deal as Peter Jackson being handed the ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" was in these recent years. Unfortunately for Lynch, things didn't end up as well with ""Dune.""  Still, there's some true Lynchian strangeness here amidst the sci-fi run amok, and the special effects hold up pretty well on the DVD transfer.  All in all, it's not nearly as bad as people proclaim, and I assume these are either ""Dune"" purists (and I can see why they would be angry with this film translation) or people who like all their sci-fi to be safe and silly like ""Star Wars.""  This should be of great interest for people who like strange sci-fi or Lynch fanatics who want to know how Lynch would handle a big-budget handed down from a meddling studio (spectacularly disastrously).",Dune
99,Antagonisten,The books deserved better,2,21 March 2005,"I have read the first two novels about Dune from Frank Herbert, and i must say i liked them quite a lot. The whole savior-theme is not one that i'm usually very interested in, but in Dune it was done with a fresh touch. When i read the book i felt it would be very suited for a screen adaption. Which makes it even more sad that this movie fails so miserably.What most disturbed me about this movie is not the fact that it looks incredibly cheap and uninspired, or that the special effects are horrible. No rather the fact that the whole story is so rushed. I never got a feeling for the story in the movie, rather it all just felt like it was moving at double speed. And important plot points were just passed with a small mention from one of the characters.And i can't find the words to express just how much i loathe movies and TV-series where a voice say what the characters are thinking. This is something i thought was limited to afternoon garbage TV, but apparently director David Lynch thought that there was some point to using it here. Because here voices are constantly saying out loud what everyone thinks. A flaw in the acting i would assume. The actors are simply not good enough to convey the characters feelings, so instead we hear this voice.In general i felt there were very few redeeming qualities to this movie. The general lack of quality when it comes to special effects, script, direction and story just ruins the experience for me. Also the general psychedelic 1970's style of the movie doesn't really appeal to me, and Toto's music further increases that feeling. I rate this 2/10, the books deserved better.",Dune
100,asda-man,SHOCK! HORROR! A genuinely terrible David Lynch film?,3,20 October 2014,"David Lynch is my favourite director. I've seen and loved all of his films (apart from Lost Highway, which I've yet to see) and even some of his short films. However, Dune is always one I've kind of avoided thanks to its famously troubled production history. Even David Lynch himself is ashamed of it! It wasn't until I realised that I had two films of his left to see, and Dune was one of them. Did I really want Dune to be the last David Lynch film I see? No. So I bought it and went in with an open mind and even a tinge of excitement. After all, it's a David Lynch film! And there's many people who actually praise the film. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.I may be a little biased because I'm not into this space opera kind of stuff. I watched the first two Stars Wars films recently and was bored by them both. So maybe I'm not the Dune target audience. I tried really hard at the beginning to understand what's going on, but I quickly realised that it was useless, so I just let the whole thing wash over me. I'm still not really sure what it's about. The son of some sort of planet queen going on an adventure to ride a giant sandworm and defeat the evil floating fat man? The screenplay is chock full of gobbledegook which only Trekkies would fully understand. However, I realise that this isn't David's fault. I'm sure his original three and half hour epic would've been much easier to follow.A lot of people say that the special effects are really good. I'd say that 30% of them are good. I actually said ""oh dear"" out loud when Kyle McLachlan and Patrick Stewart had that block fight at the beginning. Most of the effects are hideous and the sets are too. They were obviously very expensive, but the sets look very cardboard in a Batman & Robin kind of way. The only thing more cardboard than the sets was the characterisations. I must admit that the giant worms were done very well, and all of the scenes with them were fairly entertaining. Everything else felt rather limp.I could deal with the wooden acting, as it made the ordeal easier to sit through. What I couldn't deal with was the general dullness of it all. Dune bored me and I couldn't wait until it was all over. I didn't care about any of the cardboard characters. Even the usually likable Kyle is flat and rigid, and his love interest was sort of thrown into the mix for the sake of it! The only character I was interested in was the floating fat man, and that was mainly for the comic relief he brought, intentional or not. The directing was also rather plain and conventional. Even the dream sequences (David's speciality) were poorly done.There's one moment in Dune which ironically sums up everything about its tormented production. It's the moment where David Lynch has a cameo as a spice harvester who gets eaten by a giant sandworm. David's there trying his absolute hardest to harvest the best of the material, but the overwhelming production team destroy everything's he's worked towards and eat David in the process. Dune is the reason why every (good) director should have final cut and control on his/her film. I'm sure if David had complete control, then he would've given us a strange epic to cherish for years to come. However, he didn't and so the film has been viscously butchered and has little redeeming value. Oh well, I suppose every good director has to have at least one bad film in his/her filmography?

101,Aylmer,Creative & Awe-Inspiring Half-Baked Space Disaster,7,28 October 2014,"I find it very fitting that Sean Young was in both this film and BLADE RUNNER as the love interest of the protagonist. This film has a lot in common with the other grim futuristic science fiction film especially in terms of deadeningly slow pace given life by a choice cast and some of the most visionary and creative production design seen up to the time.Films are only as interesting as their antagonists, and Lynch's DUNE does an excellent job setting those up. The Harkonnens are wonderfully nasty and amoral beings living in a cold and sterile industrial hell- planet with smoke stacks, cables, and cubicles as far as the eye can see. The Imperial planet is austere in a Victorian sense and the Spacing Guild presented in such a ghastly and grotesquely inhuman fashion that they're as interesting as they are stomach-churning. All three of these villainous factions give the film the life that it has. Unfortunately, the good guys are quite one-dimensional and dull in comparison. Kyle McLachlan doesn't really get to do much with his part, other than slowly become more obsessive, powerful, and unlikable as the film progresses. Ms. Young gets to do even less and maybe has 3 or 4 lines. You know you're in trouble when a narrator has to tell us, ""Paul and Chani's love grew"" because the film gives us no other indication of this. I believe that's where the film fails, is in giving any depth to its main characters or any believability or humanity to their character arcs. This may have been the result of numerous cuts made to the film based on an already quite abridged script. A lot of the narrative failings fall on the shoulders of director Lynch however, as he is so unable to ""show"" what is going on that he relies on characters' inner monologues to ""tell"" us what is going on, and much of the time quite unnecessarily.Despite its great failings and bizarre combination of confusion and slowness, DUNE has well-realized otherworldly atmosphere aided immeasurably by the costuming department who went all-out in creating a visual style for the film that has never been equaled since. It's a truly unique mixture of styles and various steam-punk / H.R. Geiger influence on display. Historically, this film represents a major crossroads of some of the best special effects people working at the time, with makeup artist Giannetto De Rossi, mechanical effectsman Carlo Rambaldi, explosive engineer Kit West, and miniature set guru Emilio Ruiz all combining forces for the only time in all of cinema. The results are a mixed bag for sure, but on the occasions in which this film works, it's utterly amazing.",Dune
102,saadanathan,Copy cat of star wars but not that bad 6/10,6,22 October 2020,"""Dune"" is a very unique film. Based on the novel by Frank Herbert, this film was very complicated to even start production. There were many failed attempts before David Lynch came aboard. Many attempts to produce and shoot the movie with no success, so I'll give it a few points for the effort. Now, ""Dune"" in total feels like a copy cat of Star Wars, Star Trek, Blade Runner, etc. even if the movie is based on an original story and novel. There are many similarities between all these franchises and movie sagas. if it's the story, characters or whatsoever. ""Dune"" tried to be a success but ultimately failed at the box office and with the critics reviews. It's story is maybe worth keeping as a book. On the other hand there are many good things about this film that I would say are worth looking into and not judging too fast. Horrible movie or not, it has a fascinating story that is interesting to dive into. The cinematography is a little ruff but you can find its good moments. Costume design, sounds, editing and everything else are worth mentioning. So even if this film feels a little bit of a copy cat, it still has a huge fan base and saga surrounding its narrative. Which leads me to ""Dune"" of 2020 (is expected to hit theaters on october 2021). I have high hopes for this film, Dennis Villeneuve is a well appreciated director and with an ensemble of actors in the newest film, I don't see where it can flop.",Dune

The Emperor is frankly laughable, cowering before the Navigator guild...the Navigators are huge, slug like creatures...the method of travel for their space ships is apparently mind over matter, since they miraculously transport from one place to another...in huge ships that look like weird can openers...All in all, it is a strangely engrossing film, but lacks way too much to have ever been taken seriously...",Dune

I don't know how much is removed from the novel to condense it into a feature-length film... I'm sure it's a lot, but I don't miss it. I had heard the film was impossible to understand without knowing Herbert's work, but for the most part I didn't feel lost. Yes, it's weird as hell and some stuff doesn't make sense, but that's David Lynch for you. I got on board for the bizarre ride and was treated with giant worms and funky outfits and other fun stuff. It's got a number of Lynchian touches, particularly his dreamlike sense of worldbuilding. And what a cast! I knew about Maclachlan and Sting, but I had no idea about Dean Stockwell, Brad Dourif, Linda Hunt, Max Von Sydow, Jose Ferrer, Virginia Madsen or Patrick Stewart.

Some of it is too silly (and the blue-screen work and special effects are pretty shoddy), some of it is a little dull, but in general I was entertained. It didn't make me want to read the book, and I don't think I'd watch it again, but I liked it more than I expected to.",Dune
105,osloj,The Weird of Dune,10,7 December 2000,"I first saw previews of this film when I was 14, worms?, strange suits?, yes, yes, I had no idea that I would learn to appreciate the Herbert/Lynch realm. I then saw it a few years later and was totally blown away at what a wonderful and strange universe Lynch had created. I had never seen anything like it before and I was raised on a very sterile Star Wars. The mythology explored was fantastic. Each character had an individual notion and was strange, exotic and weird.  This is a film I will remember forever. Great sets, great costumes, and the dialogue is sufficient to keep you interested. I liked the Mentats, the evil Harkoneens, the Sarkadaur were awesome! The space scenes were bizarre, the guild navigators from another universe! It goes on and on, in a believable world not of our own. No, you won't understand everything about it, but that is the good part, that your quest will take you to new levels. I read the book and all the sequels after this. Thank you Mr Lynch!",Dune
106,harryplinkett14,Sick,1,19 April 2019,"When it isn't sick, it is just plain boring and confusing. But mostly it's sick. You don't do this to your audience. And even if we ignore the sickening stuff (you will know what I mean, if you actually watch this), the film has no coherence. It's 'tell, don't show' from beginning to end. And even that doesn't help, because the 'story' is a nonsensical mess. The scariest thing is the fact that David Lynch, who has made a lot of great films, directed this. What on earth was he thinking? How could this have been made? In any event, it belongs in hell, and remains one of very few films I actually wish I could unsee.",Dune
107,PyroSikTh,Now I Understand the Cult Status,7,22 February 2021,"Dune is a story far too involved to recap succinctly, but boiled down to its absolute basics, it's about the struggle over an empire-defining resource called Spice, which is only found on one planet in the entire galaxy. Whoever controls the spice controls the universe. We follow Paul Atreides, the young son of a Duke, born of the Duke's concubine Lady Jessica who basically amounts to a space witch. His family is at war with the Harkonnens who previously held the resource-rich planet Arrakis. Throw in some betrayals, a prophecy, unfathomably large sandworms, sonic weaponry, the Water of Life, premature births, politicking, space witches, a Guild ruled by a giant maggot-like alien, and folding space, and you're starting to get close to what Dune is.Now as I mentioned, I haven't read the books, but I can't say I went into this movie completely blind. I went in knowing about the Bene Gesserit space witches, the villainous Harkonnens, the giant sandworms, the beautifully bearded Duke Leto of House Atreides etc. etc. Maybe without this scarce knowledge, going in truly blind, this movie would've been a struggle to follow. I found it fairly easy to keep up with so long as I was paying attention, and my small slice of background knowledge was enough pretext to much of what was happening. Without that though, there's a lot in this movie to digest. You're thrust into a fairly complex universe of characters with very little explanation bar an opening monologue by Princess Irulan (which pretty much explains what I already knew going in). The film's biggest flaw is trying to squeeze in such a huge epic of a story in just two and a half hours. While it does only adapt the first book in the series, there's so much going on all the time that plot points are hastily rushed through. The second half of the movie covers nearly ten years, flipping by in narrated montages, never lingering on any one point for particularly long, even though it often feels like the most important part of the story being told. In contrast, the first half of the film spends a long time establishing the two warring houses, how and why they're being thrust together, and the importance and ecology of Arrakis. We spend more time watching Paul get jumped on by his combat trainer Gurney and duking it out with a training bot, than we do seeing him learning to ride a worm or honing his skills as the Kwisatz Hederach (the prophesized chosen one, in other words).Another aspect of David Lynch's Dune that doesn't quite land is the dialogue, both internal and external. For the most part the dialogue between characters is fine; nothing special, but serviceable to the characters and the plot around them. But every now and then the dialogue clunks you over the head with exposition. I've heard the book is very much driven by the internal thoughts of its characters, and rather than finding a way to visually represent this, Lynch instead opts to have the actors literally monologing the characters' internal thoughts as the movie goes along. Sometimes this works and feels almost necessary to understanding what's going on, while at others it feels like clobbering us over the head with unnecessary details that bog the film down and muddy an already scattershot narrative even further. In both examples, the voiceover narration is awkward to watch, often filming the actors just starring off for an uncomfortable amount of time ready for the voiceover to go over the top. Also not too sure about the decision to have the inner monologues whispered.All that said, this movie is on another level when it comes to atmosphere. Even in this chopped-up, rushed, and somewhat altered state, the core story of Dune is so compelling that it held my attention through the best and the worst the movie had to offer (although I can't say the same about my wife, who found it so dull and boring she found herself falling asleep). The production design is fantastic from floor to ceiling, creating this completely alien universe, with each setting instantly recognisable, from the darkened, Giger-inspired hallways of Caladan to the industrial complexes of Giedi Prime, from the lavish, pristine grand halls of Kaitain to the sprawling deserts of Arrakis. The costuming is a little dated by today's standards, especially the old body bags worn by The Guild, but there's just something so otherworldly about the outfits worn by the Fremen and Harkonnens.The visual effects are a bit of a mixed bag, honestly. For the most part they're fantastic practical effects, especially the worms which accurately depict their vast size, and the gruesomely disturbing Guild Navigator. On the other hand are the primitive CG effects used to recreate shielding tech, which just look like a suit of blocks loosely blocked over human features, and concealing anything worth seeing. It's fine when stationary and attached to a background setting, but the personal shields are just godawful to look at, and an early fight between tow users is almost indecipherable. The soundtrack by Toto is likewise and interesting mix of positives and negatives. Sweeping strings, heavily distorted guitars, and synthesisers of all shapes and sizes make up the audio. For the most part it's glorious, but at others it feels misplaced or a little too tied to the typically sonic identity of the 80s, with solo guitars screeching in at the worst moments.Dune absolutely has the potential to be great, and if nothing else watching the Lynch version just makes me even more excited to see what Villeneuve does with his. In fact it makes me desperate for Villeneuve to pull off his pitched sequel as well, splitting the story in two halves in order to ensure it gets the attention it deserves. Ending with the Harkonnen attack on Arrakis and Paul's escape would be an excruciating cliffhanger. Lynch's version is far from perfect, but for me, the good outweighs the bad. There's enough here for me to sink my teeth into and overlook the cheesy dialogue you're beaten over the head with, or the painfully dated CG effects work, or the rushed second half that's desperate to get through the plot points to the end. I give Dune a somewhat respectable 7/10, all things considered.",Dune
108,Al_The_Strange,"""He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing.""",10,12 May 2013,"Dune is a very strange, vicious, beautiful place, from a very renowned series of novels by Frank Herbert and his son. Book fans and sci-fi aficionados should already be familiar with this fantastic franchise full of otherworldly planets and empires, of fremen and sandworms, and the spice melange.This 1984 film is an attempt to adapt Frank Herbert's deep and dense story into a palpable format. At the time of its release, the film was a massive flop, and it has garnered its fair share of complaints. So much so that even director David Lynch condemned the film as his biggest failure, and has effectively disowned it. The biggest issues are that the film is gaudy, messy, and pretentious. Chances are that if the world of Dune doesn't captivate you, these issues will beat you over your head, and you'll walk away thinking the film overly long and dull.Dune does captivate me, however. From start to finish, it dishes out a plethora of fantastic imagery, thanks to its strange array of baroque props and costumes, its elaborate settings, it the story overall. David Lynch manages to squeeze in a few of his signature freak-out scenes, with strange images and scenes overlaid over each other in surreal montages, mostly during dream and spice-induced sequences. The man also tends to focus a lot on strange and grotesque details, many of which are so weird and out-there that they might seem out of place or unintentionally funny. And yet, that's one of the things I love about this film: the strangeness of it. I believe it's immensely successful at being otherworldly, and I feel that's most appropriate for Dune.This film's pacing can be a hit or a miss though. The first half is entirely devoted to House Atreides settling on Arrakis, and these scenes can be rather dry. The more interesting segments occur in the last half, with the fremen uprising against House Harkonnen. There are big, epic battles at key moments, but they are pretty short, and special effects are of such mixed quality that it can be distracting (the biggest gripe I have is that many guns go off without producing any visible beams or bolts). What really makes this film interesting will be the individual scenes involving the characters and their journey.That brings me to the most important aspect to this film: the story. Fans of the book may complain that the film swaps out ""desert power"" with weirding modules, thus undermining the tactical prowess of the characters. However, I feel the movie does the book decent justice, especially in the overall tone and style. A lot from the story and characters are lost between the book and the movie, but the fundamentals remain. On its own merits, the movie is not hard to follow, even with its vast array of Dune lore laid out. The plot is sound and interesting, and there's just enough to the characters to make them endearing. As the plot and characters progress, themes of destiny are strongly enforced.On a cinematic level, the film is superbly constructed, with quality photography and very vivid editing. A few shots appear cheap, especially with some special effects appearing incomplete or gaudy, but other effects are great. Acting is very strong all around: Kyle MacLachlan is especially powerful and commanding as Paul Atreides. I enjoyed the performances of Francesca Annis, Sean Young, Jose Ferrer, Brad Dourif, Linda Hunt, Dean Stockwell, and Max Von Sydow. Kenneth McMillan is extremely hammy as the baron, and I love him that way. Sting offers a brief and gratuitous cameo, but he delivers a deliciously fun performance as Feyd Rautha, and he delivers one of the best psychotic smiles of all time. Writing can be a hit and a miss; I love a lot of the lines, but some of them are dumb, and there is a ton of exposition (especially regarding voice-overs, which are used to death here, and probably aren't necessary). This production uses some very elaborate, very interesting, and very big sets, props, and costumes. The music, by the rock band Toto, is really awesome and epic, and is one of my favorite music scores.This adaptation of Dune has its share of issues that hasn't sat well with many viewers. However, it is a big, sweeping, epic sci-fi adventure with a very interesting universe. The film has a strong emotional power in its presentation, and that alone has cemented it as a personal favorite of mine, despite all its problems. For the open-minded sci-fi fans, I recommend giving this film a try. For an alternative adaptation, however, the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune should be worth a look as well.David Lynch's Dune has an extended cut available on DVD, which runs for about three hours. There is a wealth of interesting new scenes, but this version is very cheaply edited, it has a terrible prologue, the pacing is substantially slower, and since it was made for TV, all the bloody scenes were cut out. I personally prefer the theatrical cut, but the extended edition is worth seeing for fans.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)",Dune
109,hellholehorror,Old-school effects,6,12 May 2021,Some of the models and effects were amazing. Some were much less impressive. The print was very dirty. Some of the chroma key looked really bad. Shame that the sound was not surround. Very original and creative use of effects but not the best example of this sci-fi fantasy type. They tried to pack too much story in. It should have been a trilogy of shorter movies. An interesting story but I had real trouble following it. I liked the old-school effects but failed to connect to the story.

110,blackmamba99971,David Lynch's best work,10,19 February 2013,"Dune, quite possibly the most classic Scifi films made in the mid eighties. Frank Herberts cult classic novels was a major hit to the public, which gave way for the film later on. To see Kyle Mclaughlin play Paul Maudib, a young man who is the birthed messiah called the Ques'aks Hadderach or the super being was magnificent. I love every bit of this film, the scenery, the special effects, and above all the battle between good and evil. Kenneth Macmillan (Baron Vladimir Harkonnen). One of the most disgusting individuals to grace the screen with his diseases and scabs to gross the public. Who would want to marry into that?? However to be fair to Kenneth, he did a great convincing job at being this vile creature with no moral aspects. I found it intriguing to see such a film and the dated year 10191 AE where Earthers go into space long after colonization took place. For eons and ages past they turn to new ways of life which led them all to this point in their evolution. Forgetting they ever had anything to do with earth in ancient past. The music was top notch, the vast and irreplaceable cast was sheer genius, and the famed worms for which this movie will best be remembered for. Frank gave us a vision, a vision of true horror in space, the wonders as well as the miracles. Highly recommended to those over fourteen years of age. incredible film which later on went to develop a mini series in the mid nineties. Check it out, great cast and great fun.",Dune

Lynch, step off of it! You betrayed Frank Herbert and killed the book! For what it was, the movie sucked (for everything it was not, it wasn't bad), and the extended TV version is so much better.

118,OttoVonB,Freaks and monsters.,7,21 June 2006,"Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" works as a potent tale of political intrigue to gain control of an essential natural resource, only found on the desert plant Arrakis (nicknamed ""Dune""). Imperial families (the noble Attreides - metaphor for the Americans - and the evil Harkonnens - metaphor for the soviets/Nazis?) vie for control of the planet, until the son of the former family joins the local nomadic freedom fighters.Enter producer Dino De Luaurentiis, intent on adapting the epic novel to the screen, with the help of director Ridley Scott. Scott again brilliantly enlisted H.R. Giger to design the creatures and environments. Of this version of Dune, only a few paintings and memories remain. Exeunt Scott and Giger, enter David Lynch.David Lynch's film is a mixed bag, with almost equal strokes of genius and ineptness. The acting is quite poor in places and it remains a mystery how, in a post Star Wars environment, FX in a major motion picture could be such a let-down. The genius lies in Lynch's crazed portrayal of the Harkonnen family, whose physique, wardrobe and even planet rank with the finest and most deranged of Lynch's visual creations. The use of voice-overs is a poor compromise to make up for 30 minutes of lacking screen time that could have fleshed-out and bettered the whole thing (this stuff was neither written nor shot).""Dune"" is fascinating and, if only for its design, deserves its cult following. Unfortunately, there is just no denying how all this could have been better. Perhaps in time, the Scott-Giger version will yet be made...Numerous flaws notwithstanding, ""Dune"" deserves to be seen, if only for the delicious parade of freaks on display.

119,La Gremlin,Oh dear...,3,5 March 2002,"Note: This review is for the extended ""Alan Smithee"" versionTwo things can happen if you try to adapt a book to the screen.  The movie may end up very different from the book.  This isn't always a bad thing in my opinion.No, the worst thing that can happen when you adapt a book into a movie is this: you are TOO close to the book.  The director ends up just showing you what he thinks every event in the story looked like.  ""Dune"" is a prime example of this.  It's tempting for me to say that this movie is so laughably bad that it's good.  But I think it might have bypassed good and gone right back to being bad again.I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of _Dune_ (the book) to start with.  I tried to read it over the summer and was nearly bored to death.  I did find one thing interesting:Kids, this story is all about drugs!The buying of drugs, the selling of drugs, the politics of drugs, the addiction to drugs.  Furthermore, the characters who partake of the strongest drugs are granted special powers.So, basically, a reasonably good _Dune_ movie would be a drug movie.

They did not understand the concept and ""Dune"" was not your standard science fiction film. Well...they were wrong. Author Frank Herbert himself was very pleased with this translation of his book to film, a masterful job by David Lynch and a wonderful cast. It is a pity that Lynch was turned away from his own film by the longer cut that was ordered for TV release. It ate away at the very best parts of the film, without adding anything. In order to do the longer version on the cheap they even changed the narrator from princess Irulan (Virgina Madsen) to an unknown male because her contract for the film was finished. As the narration of the book is from Irulan's viewpoint this was a major fault with the extended version. The later mini-series version of ""Dune"" (2002) was also very good in some ways, and not nearly as good in others. Joining Kyle Maclachlan as the ideal Paul, was Jurgen Prochnow as Duke Leto, Francesca Annis of ""Krull"" fame as Lady Jessica, Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck, and Dean Stockwell in one of his rare film appearances as doctor Wellington Yueh. Many other excellent and well known actors appear as well. I will state again, with apologies to David Lynch that this theatrical cut is the definitive ""Dune"".",Dune
121,x_manicure_x,Sorry David,4,14 August 2021,"I have been escaping from this film for decades, but it was about time. Lynch blames not having final cut, but I don't think an extended cut would have made this much better. The producers wanted to make ""Star Wars for grown-ups"" but clearly didn't have the money and resources. And seriously, just look at the villain. How can this even remotely be a mature take on space opera? I liked some of the sets and costumes, but the special effects are truly hideous (God, those shields!!), and the acting is atrocious. Exaggerated acting is recurrent in Lynch's works, it creates that particular eccentric mood that makes his film peculiar, but combined with such a cartoony setting and sketchy plot, it just feels like a corny B-movie like many others. I appreciate Lynch's touch in the script and cinematography here and there (especially in the first act), but overall it's just too slow-paced and incoherent to be worth two hours of your life. Liked how they filled it with voice-overs to explain what the hell is going on, what the characters are thinking, and pretty much everything that they couldn't shoot or include in the final cut.

An ambitious, epic, utterly mind-boggling--and, let's admit it, all-out weird--adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel, Dune remains one of the most controversial films in the director's exceedingly provocative career. The story (if Dune can be said to have just one story) is complex and convoluted in the epic tradition; it has Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Usul Muad'Dib Atreides something to do with political intrigue and a planet that is home to a precious spice and gigantic sand worms. Think Shakespeare's Henry IV with a dash of Tremors, and set in another galaxy. But despite plenty of strangely whispered voice-overs that explain the characters' thoughts (and endlessly detailed exposition), storytelling is not really among the film's strong points. There are, however, a lot of memorably fantastic/grotesque images, an extraordinary cast, and a soundtrack featuring Toto. I told you it was weird.

Francesca Annis, Freddie Jones, Dean Stockwell, Jose Ferrer, Brad Dourif, Sian Phillips, Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow, Sean Young . . . why, even Sting shows up (quite a lot of himself; and, according to the special features, he might have shown off even more!) Sure, most of those actors are a bit on the ""cult"" side, but they're all solid talent.The source material was a little more iffy. DUNE is a BIG book, and so different it carries a glossary of terms author Frank Herbert coined (well, in lots of cases, ripped off). And adapting the book for the screen was a delicate balancing act, as Herbert fans are, in their bookish way, as fanatical as Star fans (Trek or Wars).The surprising thing was that a movie this size, costing forty million dollars in an era when a movie's price tag was part of its marketing, was entrusted to David Lynch. Until that time Lynch's most normal movie was ""The Elephant Man."" Lynch, who enjoys focusing on the weird and the frankly disgusting made Herbert's novel even more weird and disgusting. Whenever the Harkonnens appear onscreen, lay aside your popcorn.For all that, the streamlined story is compelling; and while the effects are purely 1984, the sets are gorgeous. It's always eye-catching. The major problem with the movie is that most of the more interesting and/or likeable characters get killed, incapacitated or go AWOL at about the half-way mark. Since this movie is nearly two and a half hours long, that means a long stretch of near-tedium before the climax.The second half of the movie is dominated by the people Paul Atreides needs to free (part of the myth popular among left-leaning artist that normal people can't do anything for themselves, they need a ""strong man"" or woman or government to come and break their shackles; without some outsider who is nobler and higher and richer and more educated telling them how to go it's a wonder they can feed themselves or tie their shoes).The second half of the movie has the normal people played by Everett McGill and Sean Young, and they're perfectly fine. But after the freak actors and carefully-nuanced performances of the first half, the come off unfortunately bland. It's not their fault. They're doing the best. They're parts simply aren't written in intriguing ways. Because the movie's first half is so compelling and has so many great performers doing their best to chew the scenery, it deserves more than five stars out of ten.

Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" is one of those unfilmable novels (in fact, it makes ""Lord of the Rings"" look like child's play), and David Lynch manages to capture at least the bare essentials of the novel -- the sense of pessimism, dark urgency, and atmospherics.  The latter is a sorely-missed quality, and ""Dune the Movie"" holds up very well compared to the post-movie theatrical wasteland of the early 21st century, and such films as ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Star Wars Episode 1"" and ""The Time Machine.""Viewers would be well-advised to try and read the book first -- again, like ""LOTR,"" some background is almost a necessity before attempting the film. The story is just too complex to translate well to the big screen, so if you haven't read the book then you might find yourself simply relaxing and soaking up the (very well done) atmosphere and the visuals.I'm very thankful that this film wasn't made sometime in the past five years.  It would be painful to see Frank Herbert's genius placed on the chopping block of some money-grubbing producer and made into (yet another) CGI-based carnival freakshow.  Enjoy this film for what it is, a ""true"" re-imagining of the novel ""Dune"" as seen by David Lynch's somewhat twisted imagination.Revised review, 8/10",Dune
129,chubarova,Not good realisation.,6,22 April 2020,"I think this film had a bid, difficult and interesting idea as basic. Unfortunately, the realisation of film has some problems. Firstly, the story tells the viewer life of number of planets with their own government, the rebels and their struggle for freedom. So, this film had to show some political story (or social), but as for me the world of film os too difficult to understand from one film. There are a lot of new words (and they are difficult), you hear big amount of new terms at the same moment, and you don't catch the meaning of one but immediately you hear the new one. Secondly, the cast is perfect, they tried to show all emotions of their characters. Thirdly, the visual effects could be bettter, I can compare it with Star Wars (first trilogy) both were released approximately at the same period of time, bur Dune has some problems with visual effects.
So, it's film, that has a potential to be one of the greatest but it's very average.",Dune
130,basrutten,Like being eaten by a sand worm,4,11 June 2005,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely loved the book by Frank Herbert. The book is simply amazing in almost every aspect. It created a fascinating world, full of complex characters with hidden agendas, political scheming and much more. This movie does absolutely none of those things. Instead, it screws up in almost every possible way.First of all, everything in this movie looks and sounds totally wrong. I always imagined the world of Dune as a somewhat medieval world, albeit with space travel and some modern weapons. In David Lynch's adaptation, everything looks like it's been copied from some crappy eighties music video (and given the presence of Sting, that might actually be true). Just about everything, from the costume design to the music, looks horribly fake, cheesy, or both. The weird psychedelic atmosphere created by Lynch doesn't work at all. I know not everything was possible back in 1984, but I do know that the first three Star Wars movies (which all precede this production) looked a lot more convincing and appealing.Secondly, this movie is horribly shallow. The complex storyline and characters from the book are nowhere to be found. The plot is more a series of very loosely connected highlights from the book than an actual story. If you haven't read the book, you'll likely have no idea of what this incoherent mess is about. Also, character development is almost non-existent, and hardly any of the characters are convincing. The acting is almost universally bad, with the actor that plays Paul sticking out as especially awful. How are we ever supposed to believe this guy is the messiah? Is there anything positive to say about Dune then? Well, a couple of things are done decently. I was surprised to see that Sting actually does a fairly good acting job, and the sand worms are pretty cool as well. The knife fight between Paul en Feyt-Rautha is decent as well (as opposed to all of the other action sequences, which consist simply of shots of people shooting alternated with shots of things being blown up. Yawn).But that's about it. For the most part, it's just a huge misinterpretation of a great book, with a hugely simplified storyline, a totally unconvincing lead actor, poor acting, horribly costume and set design, and just about everything else that could be done wrong.Still, I give it ** out *****. It's based on great source material, and that should account for something.",Dune
131,ivanmessimilos,Big mess,4,8 June 2021,"A very strange and unusual film. I haven't read Herbert's novel, but it seems to me that a lot is being tried to squeeze into one film that lasts a little over two hours. Lots of characters, lots of events and happenings. I forced myself to watch at it multiple times to perhaps understand it or see something new that I hadn't before, but the effect is always the same. Big mess of the movie. The story and what is happening on the screen is very difficult for me to follow. The characters are almost non-existent because they have very few scenes so they are nothing developed. A real shame because the film has huge potential, and I personally am a big fan of SF.",Dune
132,daniewhite-1,Dust,5,14 December 2020,"'Dune' by David Lynch had a problematic development, a problematic production, a problematic reception and has remained problematic for it's principal creator ever since.However it is not all bad; in fact the film, even in it's theatrical cut, has some true successes; however these are gradually eroded by the winds of inexplicable inanity and insanity.Lynch certainly gains a brilliant production design and set design with some very effecting practical effects.A sensational cast of European actors add gravitas and clout to some fine American character actors.The source material is obviously beloved and appreciatively adapted.But, and it's a significant ""but"", the whole is much less than the sum of it's parts and by the final act the flagging film has been flayed to ripe silliness.Clearly the material could never have been successfully brought to the screen in this manner: overall failure was inevitable given its constraints.The earlier passages give a greater sense of the thrust of the work that Lynch seems to have intended his 'Dune' to be: referencing colonial and military films of the twentieth century, radical politics, sci-fi speculative fiction and medieval aesthetics of religion.This dynamic is gradually dissolved and replaced with a crash course in compromise which intensifies as the run time proceeds.I recommend the production design including sets, props and costumes, the cast and some of the earlier scenes which possess a great vision of a film in small parts but I can't give more than an even score of 5/10 for the complete film.If Lynch is your thing then I recommend 'Dune'; if genre and effects films are for you then 'Dune' has good stuff to offer: for everyone else I recommend caution.",Dune
133,ripcords,Spectacular attempt and ultimate failure to adapt the novels,3,24 July 2020,"If you have read the books you truly wanted to see this world come to the big screen. Knowledge of the books isn't necessary though, to see how poorly this translation fared. Just seeing the beginning sets and costumes brings great promise but the film ultimately fails to capture the intricacies and background information that made the books so revered.",Dune
134,HelloTexas11,failed but interesting attempt,6,28 February 2009,"In retrospect, 'Dune' is not a satisfactory adaptation of the famous sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert; neither is it the total disaster some critics claimed it to be upon release. Its problem is a common one, one that filmmakers have wrestled with ever since they started making movies from books. How do you take a sprawling epic of several hundred pages, with dozens of major characters and condense it to a two-hour feature? In that sense, 'Dune' is neither better nor worse than many such attempts. And yet Gene Siskel was moved to write, ""I hated watching this film."" His partner, Roger Ebert, called it ""the worst movie of the year."" Such vitriol seems unnecessarily harsh. Director David Lynch makes a brave stab at faithfully transferring the story to film, and his ubiquitous leading man, Kyle MacLachlan, is actually quite good in the starring role of Paul Atreides. At times, Lynch succeeds in capturing the genuine weirdness of Herbert's novel, but at others, the film seems like a too-literal translation of the work. The special effects range from impressive to pedestrian. The key failure to me is one I became aware of about two-thirds of the way through: in the novel, the near-total lack of water on Arrakis/Dune is described in stunning detail and at great length, and as more than one reader pointed out, reading 'Dune' actually made you thirsty. This major element is never conveyed believably in the movie, and it is crucial. Other cast members' performances are generally adequate, with a few standouts. Kenneth McMillan makes an appropriately disgusting Baron Harkonnen, and Francesca Annis is a beautiful and stoic Lady Jessica. One bit of casting that caused quite a stir at the time was rock star Sting as Harkonnen's nephew, Fayd-Rautha. As it turns out, it hardly warranted the big fuss; Sting has virtually nothing to do in the film. He struts on camera smirking a few times, has barely any dialogue, and his one 'big' scene (a fight with Paul Atreides) is pretty brief. 'Dune' disappointments, but is not without its moments of interest. And reading the book first is highly recommended.",Dune

I can't say I understood fully what was going on since theres so many different terms and stuff going on. But fine. I decided after reading I would watch the movie....and honestly I only managed to get like 30 min in before shutting it off. I honestly couldnt get through it...and I rarely turn off movies. I usually try and get through it and find some merit in it....but I just couldnt. It was a mixture of being bored out of my mind, it being very weird, it being cheesy, bad special effects...and even the acting wasnt very good. I dont know how to describe other than it sounding like Kyle McLachlan was doing a community play for the first time. Do you know what I mean? Like it sounded very theater-esque but just not good. Too much narration as well.I might still give the upcoming Dune movie a try because its Denis Villeneuve, and so far I have really liked what he's done.",Dune
137,anthonyjlangford,Misunderstood masterwork,8,9 February 2020,"How is it that after all this time, it still hasn't received the recognition it deserves?
A big budget science fiction epic crossed with the extreme ArtHouse vision of David Lynch in the early 80s when sci fi was still a relatively new genre, (post Star Wars renaissance of only 7 years earlier). 84 was Sixteen Candles, Footloose and The Terminator.
No one was doing anything like Dune. Somehow Lynch managed to conjure the budget for this film with it's brilliant production design unique characterisation and creativity, not just in effects, but in dialouge and story. One of its boldests aspects is the internal dialogue of characters in their whispering tones. This is a very arthouse concept and yet it works within the realm of Dune. It's incredibly bold. Even an indie film would struggle to pull this off.
Some of it is over the top of course but that's the nature of Lynch and the story. Theres little to denigrate it. Patrick Stewart and Kyle Mchlanan are great. So is all the supporting cast. Sadly, Sting in particular is false.
Most of it still holds up today, other than a few green screen model effects shots, mostly because of its brilliant sets and production design.
The music is very powerful and is just as pertinent now than ever.
Many of its earliest critics compared it to the novel. A film is an entirely different beast. Yet Lynch captures its complexities and oddities.
It's not for everyone but there are aspects of this film that are timeless. I first saw it in late 84 on VHS as a teenager and I didn't understand it but I thought it was fascinating. Even today there is still elements that continue to enlighten and reveal. How many films can offer that gift?
Lambasted by many for far too long, it's time that we all reassessed Dune for the unique classic that it truly is.
Great performances by many of the sizable cast. Dean Stockwell, Sian Phillips, wife of Peter O'Toole. All really, except for Sting.
Mesmerizing 35 years on. Deserved of your analysis and praise to Lynch's superb and unique talent. Bold before belief.",Dune
138,Christopher_Reid,"Weird, beautiful, thought-provoking, exciting but feels unfinished",8,10 April 2015,"This is a very weird movie that feels incomplete in many ways. Part of that is because it's based on an epic novel that would be difficult to put on screen in a single film even in 2015. So it was an extremely ambitious task to try to make it in 1984. But the result has some of the most gorgeous and interesting sets and costumes I've ever seen in a movie. I was blown away by a lot of the imagery.Some of the special effects are really cool and impressive and some are fairly weak (but not terrible). The force-field thing was pretty awesome and unique and the worms were also quite convincing and majestic. The acting is very solid overall with many famous people making appearances. Kyle MacLachlan (from Twin Peaks) is really cool in particular, plus there are several strikingly beautiful actresses that I would totally never develop a crush on ever. The cast of characters is quite colourful, providing lots of variety of personalities and points of view.I read Dune a few years ago and thought it was awesome although I still haven't read many books let alone sci-fi ones so I don't have a lot to compare it with. I liked the richness of detail, all the different kinds of people and cultures, the cool names, the weapons, the philosophy. It makes you believe in its world and want to learn more. I've always had a thing for fantasy and sci-fi, that it fulfills some deeper urge or purpose for humans. We're not meant to just be sitting around in offices or watching TV, we are meant to have grander lives, incredible journeys.This movie seems to be fairly true to the book, Frank Herbert was apparently impressed and generally satisfied with what it was able to achieve. It's main flaw is that it's far from polished. The script has too many gaps. The movie doesn't flow very well. I roughly knew the story so I could get what was happening and was overjoyed to revisit the story for the first time since I read the book. I think it has the makings of a great movie. They just needed to spend more time on the script or give more creative control to the director. Something like that.Apparently David Lynch considers this his only failure. It's funny because I'm pretty sure it's also one of his highest grossing films (and I think it's actually very good for a ""worst"" film). The issue, of course, is that it cost a fair bit to make and bombed relative to that amount. But the box office can depend a lot on marketing and timing (and luck) as much as quality. Many films have become far more popular as videos than in their original cinematic release.It was very interesting and exciting to see a totally different kind of Lynch movie as well, more of a Hollywood spectacle than a creepy dream-like thriller. I think he's very brilliant when it comes to imagery and style in general. I wish Hollywood would take more chances with auteur directors, giving them large budgets and solid franchises to work on (like Christopher Nolan with Batman for example).I have to say I liked the music a lot. It grew on me over time and seemed to fit the tone and mood of the subject matter very well. There is a lot of mystery but also inevitability, that something profound is due to happen soon. Together with the visuals and some of the philosophical quotes, it can give you shivers down the spine. I sometimes find movies are like a way to add to my dreams. They give you more emotional states to play with. I can close my eyes and be Paul Muad'dib and hear the music and recite one of his mantras and feel enlivened. It can give you strength and calmness. It's all about escapism isn't it? And yet, perhaps, delving inwards and finding new things or finding closure.",Dune
139,peeedeee-94281,Should Not Even Be Called A 'Movie',3,7 September 2020,"Quite frankly, I don't even remember having watched Dune before. Maybe I did, and it didn't stick.
This isn't a 'movie', this is a highlights clip, like when you watch a TV show and they have a 3 minute recap of what happened in a previous episode, or a preview of what is going to happen.
Scenes come and go at random. The plot is confusing. There's way too much whispering when people are using their inner monologue. And overall, it's just a silly mess, especially towards the end.
Why oh why didn't Lynch just spread this over multiple movies? Then he could have made a coherent, trilogy.
Not sure how the new movie will handle the material. A lot of it was really dull, and you never really feel any connection to the world or characters because of the jarring edits. So we'll see if Dune can be reinvented, and saved.",Dune

The film kind of grows into you when you are kind enough to give it another look. And 'Dune' definitely deserves another chance. The film is visually striking, some of the special effects look outdated, but that doesn't reduce the visual poetry for one bit. There are many layers and nuances hidden that it is easy to oversee after first or even second time, and when you discover them, then the film starts to makes much more sense.

143,JohnWelles,It's Like No Other Movie You'll Ever See.,7,15 February 2010,"""Dune"" (1984), directed by David Lynch, who made the art-house classic ""Eraserhead"" (1977), is probably the strangest mainstream science-fiction film ever made. The movie went through a well documented production hell, at various points the film was offered to directors like David Lean, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Ridley Scott. It was finally rescued from this and eventually Lynch was offered it, who took up the chance to make a screen adaptation of Frank Herbert's hugely respected 1965 novel.The films plot is deceptively simple: In the far future, a duke and his family are sent by the Emperor to the sand world Dune from which comes a spice that is essential for interstellar travel. But there encounter problems with Paul Atreides, who may or may not be a Messiah the natives have been waiting for. Of course it gets much, much more complicated than this and at times it's almost impossible to follow and reading the book beforehand, I'm reliably informed, is a good idea.The music, photography and set design all very impressive, and the special effects are still good (notably the sand worms and the ships that travel through space), if a little dated in some aspects. The acting is variable to say the least. Sting should never have been included and his performance undoubtedly still haunts him, but Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides brings just the right note of ambiguity to his character and his performance is the stand-out one in the whole picture. But I am beating around the bush here: David Lynch's direction lends the whole film a real other-worldly feel that is missing in most science-fiction movies. You really do feel like this is the far, far future. He also gives the film moments of true surrealism that are astonishing for a movie that cost $50 million that the backers obviously wanted back (something which never happened: on its original release, ""Dune"" failed badly) and was intended for a mainstream audience. Unfortunately, despite and perhaps because of, David Lych's visual panache, the movie is nevertheless incoherent towards the last half hour and even at the end, when I had finally got the plot straight in my head, others I wouldn't be surprised to see scratching there heads.This isn't a film classic, it may not even be a minor masterpiece, but it is one of the few movies to convey the feeling of the future so purely, and because of this, good or not, it's a movie you must see at least once in your life. Whatever it is, it's like no other movie you've ever seen.",Dune

Otherwise sane and reasonable individuals start foaming at the mouth and twitching uncontrollably when recollecting the 15 minutes they managed to sit through. Others start screaming obscenities and become unable to articulate sentences to describe their loathing of this movie. I've yet to meet anybody who DIDN'T think it one of the worst movies ever made. Why is it, then, that I love it? 'Dune' is one of my favorite movies. I have watched it several dozen times and never tire of it. Despite De Laurentiis's butchering of both Lynch's screenplay, and the original cut of the movie, enough of the Director's signature style remain for his fans, with many moments that are pure Lynch; bizarre and disturbing  the heart plugs, the caged cat, the weird incestuous homoerotic undertones, the muddled dream sequences. The entire thing is beautifully crafted with genuine Baroque excess. The production design is breathtaking, with a rare sense of new worlds being created and given their own aesthetic. Every character, though thoroughly over-the-top, is original and memorable, with Brad Dourif, Freddie Jones, Linda Hunt and Sian Phillips being particular favourites.I'm not sure why so many people find this movie so unwatchable. Personally, I find it one of the most satisfying sci-fi films ever made, and I wait in vain for Lynch to swallow his pride and oversee a collector's edition release.",Dune
146,mgruebel,The sheer daring of it!,6,2 August 2015,"The books by Frank Herbert are about a young man coming of age on the planet ""Dune,"" where the drug ""spice"" needed for space travel is linked to gigantic predatory worms and galactic intrigue that makes the ""da Vinci Code"" look like toddler's play.The Dune universe is a rich one, like Middle Earth. That comes with a problem: it would be insane to attempt to capture it in a 2-3 hour film. David Lynch was insane enough to try. Unfortunately for Lynch, 1984 was not a year when you could make three cinematic movies that are not sequels, essentially an 11 hour-long movie spread over three release dates. That had to wait for New Line Cinema's well-rewarded trust in Peter Jackson 15 years later. Who knows what Lynch could have done with that more recent format.The result is a failure by conventional means because the filmed material had to be cut so drastically that it became confusing. Lynch was forced to compress the entire second half of a long book into 30 minutes, almost as an afterthought to the grand beginning.However, the spoils of war are so wonderful in this film, that I give it a 6 anyway: you will not be happy after seeing it, but you will go ""Holy ..."" during the film and wonder ""what could have been?"" The set design is incredible. The spaceships are bizarre baroque things so different from anything conventional, it puts an entirely new spin on what one can do with SF visuals. Baron Harkonnen is so juicily evil in his corrupt world punctuated by gay snuff sex that even the most hardened viewer has to shake their head in disbelief. Only David Lynch could have pulled this off, and Kyle MacLaughlan is well-cast as the young future emperor, a somewhat ambiguous hero.Unfortunately the movie is very faulty in its brevity. I hear that Lynch had hour(s) more shots, and I suspect if he somehow could take that material and assemble it his way, a great film would result. But ""Dune"" tanked so badly that he'll never have the opportunity. Nonetheless, I predict that ""Dune"" will be regarded by critics as an important film as time goes on.Instead we a have a competent but somewhat lackluster mini series that came out years later. It will have to do, until a director daring enough can make an 11 hour film of ""Dune"" that does the big concepts justice on the big screen.",Dune

154,shaun98,Only for Lynch/Herbert completionists,4,22 August 2002,"From what I understand about Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel, ""Dune"" was almost certainly unfilmable to begin with--not only because of its considerable length, but largely in part to its extremely dense, complex structure. There is a fair chance that the whole enterprise was doomed to begin with, although the filmmakers deserve credit for having the guts to undertake such a mammoth project. Sad to say, the results is a long, boring, and confusing turkey. It has since gone down in history as one of the all-time box-office flops. Director David Lynch himself says he wasn't too happy with the film, traditionally regarded as his worst movie. Perhaps it would be clearer had I been more familiar with the source material. For fans of the novel, it might adequately serve as a companion piece to the Herbert original, but as a stand-alone film, it's an unqualified failure.
From the start I knew that it was going to be a bad film. The opening scenes are absolutely incomprehensible (confusing would be too generous a word), setting up the story with warring factions fighting over production of ""Spice,"" supposedly the most important substance in the universe. The details are hard to keep track of, foreshadowing the convoluted plot of the film as a whole. I was never entirely clear on who was against who. After a while, I just stopped caring and waited for the end credits. I felt bad for Lynch, who spent long months on this massive project, with such disappointing results. This could have been a potential career suicide, but thankfully, he recovered in no time at all, giving us the brilliant ""Blue Velvet."" But from among his oeuvre, ""Dune"" still sticks out like a sore thumb.It might have helped somewhat had the film had the sense of awe and wonder that marks the best of the genre; ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Dark City,"" and so forth. But that was not to be. He seems to have made a conscious effort to drain any sense of joy; as a result the whole thing is actively hostile to the viewer. Just about everything is ugly and drab. The somber, sober tone, combined with the convoluted plot, makes this a tiring, unrewarding experience. Many of the special effects are embarrassingly cheesy and fake-looking. Whether this was intentional, or due to a rushed postproduction schedule, I cannot say. I will give it this; the sets are fairly well-done, and the cast is interesting, especially a pre-""Next Generation"" Patrick Stewart in a minor supporting role.Directorially, there is little that can be done with such mediocre material. No doubt David Lynch tried, but the maddening circumstances he was burdened with has doomed his efforts to failure. Every director has his off day. Stanley Kubrick had ""Spartacus."" Oliver Stone had ""Any Given Sunday."" Ridley Scott had ""1492."" Martin Scorsese had ""Boxcar Bertha."" James Cameron began his own career with ""Piranha 2: The Spawning."" And Lynch had ""Dune.""*1/2 (out of ****)Released by Universal Pictures",Dune
155,Starbuck-13,Why does Lynch hate this one?,9,15 April 1999,"To begin with, I have to say that I saw the movie first, and read the book years later. This seems to be important: Nearly everybody who read the book first hates the movie, but most of those who saw the movie first seem to like it.Now, why is this so? I cannot really understand it because, in comparition to other movies based on existing literature, what we have here is a film which stays very close to the original story and does not add many new elements.When I read the book, I could see the movie in front of me in nearly every chapter. So I really don't understand what Herbert-Fans had expected from this movie...I for my part like it a lot. It has a very mystical atmosphere about it and the story develops nicely. Of course there are some elements which are simply not explained and are therefore very confusing, but somehow this seems to be a thing Lynch tends to do in every of his movies, so what? I like some simple scenes like the opening monologue a whole lot. I LOVE the music (which played in my mind all the time while I read the book), and I think the characters are very strong and (for example Letho Atreides) sometimes full of tragedy.The part I like the most though is the worm-part. I think the special effects are not always brilliant, but seeing the scenes with the worms, I am really awestruck because they are so impressing.All in all, I think this is one of the more underrated movies in Science Fiction history. It may be because the director himself was not happy with it, or because fans expected too much from a simple two hour movie. I always enjoy watching this film and listening to the soundtrack. And I would love to see a Director's Cut version.",Dune
156,samyoung-82648,A short review,8,27 October 2021,"This film is a more faithful adaption than the 2021 version. You gain a much better appreciation of the political factions and their motives.By contrast, the new version has better acting and better effects, however, the story is more obtuse and twists some fundamental aspects of the book for ""modern reasons"". For example, the Bene Gesserit were based on Herbert's aunties who were Catholics. In order to avoid being too ""Christian"", the director changed the Bene Gesserit into something confusing and less clearly defined. I am not religious myself but this example shows how the new version became political rather than accurate. It's still a good film.This one is worth the watch. Just look past the wooden acting and dated special effects.Hopefully, IMDB will stop censoring my reviews for ideological reasons.",Dune

I found that many things are introduced in more detail. With a certain foundation, this movie will be easier to understand. The shortcomings still focus on the flat-out in the second half and the crude special effects and editing. The retro design of the buildings and spaceships is very characteristic. The actors are really well chosen, but the plot is scripted and slightly cumbersome.",Dune
158,trey-yancy-572-763547,Ridiculous over-the-top cartoon of a misfire,2,30 June 2021,"David Lynch was definitely the wrong person to hire for this project. The hugely long spoken intro is a weak excuse for a lack of visual storytelling. This was an obviously lavish production but with no real depth. The baron is an embarrassingly idiotic cartoon villain. The ""weirding modules"" are a fabrication to make up for a lack of imagination on the part of Lean. It deserved to be the enormous bomb that it was. Completely stillborn and a pain to watch. Those who are very familiar with Herbert's six-volume book series will find much of the film to be familiar but it is far from being up to the calibre of the books.For a good rendition of Dune, watch the six-part SiFi channel miniseries (available on DVD). It's a pity that Herbert was not around when it was finally done right.",Dune
159,ilikeimdb,"Lynch's vision succeeds, but not without Cliff Notes near by",7,10 June 2001,"The world cleaves into two camps:  Those who've read Dune and those who haven't. For the later group, the movie will be a hopeless journey, punctuated with a bunch of ""huh?"" and  ""what?"" utterances.  For the former, the movie's a frustrating exercise in remonstrations over what David Lynch left out, and what he emphasized.  Dune is much more about social and political tension than pure sci-fi, rivaling anything you'd ever watch on day-time soaps, but played out on a much grander and cosmological scale. Lynch manages to detrimentally deemphasize these larger issues.  But Lynch likes atmosphere and environmental details, and those elements really shine in the movie.  So much sand, so many worms.  Dune is otherworldly in a Lynchian way.  But overall, it's not a satisfying trade-off.What really frames Dune (1984) in my mind is in comparison to the Dune TV series (2000).  The Dune-2000 folks didn't seem to learn anything from the Lynch film.  Anyone who's gotten their hands on the full-blown Japanese Dune 1984 5-hour version knows it's only barely better in telling the story. Standard release Dune-1984 is superior to Dune-2000 in every meaningful category and is a lot shorter.  Lynch's vision is looking better all the time.",Dune
160,jazzest,Failure Due to Producer De Laurentiis's Misunderstanding Lynch,2,27 August 2004,"Retrospectively, the failure of this strangely slow and meditative widescreen baroque to adapt Frank Herbert's cult sci-fi novel may be a result of adventure/fantasy producer Raffaella De Laurentiis's misunderstanding David Lynch. Apparently, De Laurentiis and company had an ambition to make a super-hip flick back in the 80s, casting rock star Sting, having the most successful rock producer at the time Brian Eno as a composer, and having Lynch, whose The Elephant Man made a smash hit a few years earlier, as a director. While Lynch's recognizable signatures (e.g., grotesque makeup, surrealistic dream sequence, and low frequency noise) may amuse his fans, he turned to be a wrong director to be hired, ruining the film with his unique slow tempo to produce uneasiness. To Lynch, the biggest fruit from working for this production must be the encounter to Kyle MacLachlan, who would be cast in his successful next film, The Blue Velvet.",Dune
161,xbrad68,The band Toto did the soundtrack for Dune,7,10 February 2006,"Dune the movie is not as good as the book. The film is still worth seeing though. MacLachlan as the Young Atreides is all right. Look for the part played by Sting. Baron Harkonen looks ghastly. You feel sorry when the House Atreides is over run. The sand worms look crude compared to computer graphic animation today. The fremen all look well fed which is unusual for a desert planet with little food. If you have ever tried to push a sandbucket into the sand the wrong way then you will know that there is no way sand worms could move through sand like that in real life. There is an over 18 year old woman who started writing to famous people using the codename steal coup rumoured to be a Forbes from Walkerton On that gives you tealc from Stargate. I refuse to take orders from her as the American Shadow Vice President. My orders come from American Shadow President Jack Kennedy, Jack Oni sounds like General Jack ONeal.

162,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,100% worth seeing,7,8 September 2020,"Dune has some of the worst special effects this side of the millennium, but on the flip side, it has some truly spectacular costumes, makeup and scenery. The inventiveness and ideas behind this film are worth mentioning as it borders somewhere between comically brilliant and startlingly bad, which is quite amazing.Think about Battlefield Earth and the cavemen in Harrier jumpjets and the crazy WWII landing craft and horsey assault in Star Wars Episode 9 and you'll be somewhere near to understanding how bad this film gets in places, especially the giant worm-riding sequences with ballistic assaults near the end, but there's something about this film that's so enchanting.This is all down to David Lynch, and for some reason I dismissed Dune as not worth watching many years ago instead of submitting my brain to his incredible imagination. The character development is also superb and you feel disgust and hatred for the common enemy, but also love in an inexplicable way for being so comically bizarre.If you're looking for something unusual while still remaining watchable then Dune is a total recommend, but lower your expectations because it's really bonkers, fantastically creative and unique.",Dune

What is important to say, whose is the fault is secondary, is that this movie doesn't shine as other Lynch's masterpiece. The plot is confused and it result difficult to tell it, among different political positions and emotive situations in a sci-fi universe of wars and magics. Maybe the most interesting things are colours, freak sceneries and atmospheres, mad characters that can remember better Lynch's intuitions. For the rest I forgot rapidly the plot, and what I maintain is this sense of scary freakiness that is more in Lynch style than the unfocused story.",Dune
164,TheEtherWalk,"Frustrating film, good adaptation",7,26 October 2009,"This review is about the 3-hour version only.David Lynch's Dune is an ambitious and problematic film. I love the book series and I think the first 2 hours of the movie are brilliantly adapted. The production is huge, with great set and costume designs, and where Lynch succeeds is in creating the Dune world on screen. Stylistically it feels like it fell right off the page. The special effects are pure cheese and the action scenes laughable, but the story draws you in and plays out almost exactly like the book. There are a few discrepancies that hinder the adaptation, one being the infamous 'weirding modules' that were for some reason written into every action scene. The other comes at the end of the film, when Paul magically makes rain fall from the sky. I'm not sure what they were thinking, but maybe the ending of the book didn't have enough of a 'wow' factor. This change is silly and mars what could have been a perfect adaptation. They missed it by that much.In case you don't know the story, Dune takes place in around the year 10000, where an intergalactic feud between the House of Atreides and Harkonnen comes to a head on the desert planet of Arrakis, the only source of the Spice, the most important resource in the universe. The story is very complicated and Lynch's screenplay is faithful, almost to a fault. A certain level of patience is needed to fully enjoy the film, as is a basic knowledge of the Dune world. The uninitiated may find the film long, silly, and sometimes unintentionally funny. In some ways it is, but it's a good film if you're willing to look past these flaws.The casting is good save for one person: Everett McGill as Stilgar. If you know the series Twin Peaks, he played Ed Hurley. They couldn't have found a worse guy to play Stilgar. This guy is supposed to be the hardened leader of the fierce Fremen tribes, but he comes off as completely unthreatening and unremarkable. He can't even mutter ""Shai Hulud"" without it sounding unnatural. I like the rest of the cast, and everyone from Jessica to Paul to Leto are well performed and memorable.At the 2 hour mark, we come to a problem: They are only 1/3 of the way through the book. The final hour feels rushed and clumsy. I don't think Jessica shows up at all after giving birth to Alia. After patiently developing everything, the movie suddenly shifts into overdrive and blasts through the last 2/3 of the book in about 45 minutes. 3 hours is actually not enough time to fully tell this story. The shorter version is probably more balanced, but I wouldn't have taken anything out of the first two hours. Maybe it should have been 3/12-4 hours even.David Lynch was probably the wrong director for such an unwieldy production, and the film is a failure on a cinematic and editing level, but if you like the book you will probably enjoy it.",Dune
165,themarina1,"Love it or hate it, it's a story",8,11 April 2004,"Over the years, I have come to the understanding that there are two schools of though here. Some people absolutely hate this movie and other absolutely love it. I'm of the latter school, regularly enjoying Lynch's twisted take on the late Herbert's fantastic story. The story follows the House Atreides on a planetary move to the spice mining world of Arakis. With it, comes the power struggle and life and death situations commonly associated with political struggle. Dark and interesting, Lynch has managed to capture all of Herbert's story and mix it with some of his sick and twisted ideas. A must watch for Lynch and Herbert fans.8/10",Dune
166,stumpmee77,A few brief words from the fence.,7,6 March 2005,"Yippee for having:Paul from the book having a head on his shoulders and a brain between his ears grace us with his presence from the start. Even without the book and the actor in this movie to compare him against, the Mini series Paul came off as a butthead. I couldn't forget he looked nothing like the part whereas with the movie I dismissed the actor's real age.Irulan seen in her place--which was not all over the place. She was an observer, not a frigging mover and shaker!Usul, melange, the Litany Against Fear--taken and used. Would it had killed the mini-series writers to have those words so loved by Dune fans? The Bene Gesserit acting cool and controlled--Annis is awesome. The part where Jessica looses it over Leto, still gives me chills cause it's pops up so suddenly and runs so deep. I had problems with them in the mini series, continuously openly nervy--The dialog and acting during the scene with the box made particularly me sick. And Paul had not been trained in the Voice yet! The detail shown in the way the Fremen lived, grimy battle hardened and thin! 2000 remake--plump, looked like they washed every hour sietch people doing outdoor lunches, fighting outside in homespun--I don't think so! The Sadukar were treated with more dignity. I was scared into liking of Lynch's concept of these dark suited automatons. How much dread could be done from the remake's Italian Renassiance Honor Guard unis? Easier to understand why the Fremen kicked their butts!Yueh's part was in it--no doubts as he had his diamond tattoo! Sting as Feyd--Crazy, man! Loved him! Hated, hated in this theatric version.The Baron's crapped up face. He was supposedly fat, not oozing pus and disease! The Weirding Way! Inaccurate, totally confusing--Herbert mentioned nothing about sound mechanisms.Duncan Idaho, the only one who didn't look like the way Herbert had described him and he was so blaaah compared to everyone else.Thufir Hawat, mercy those eyebrows! The last half hour was horribly rushed. This movie needed at least another hour tacked on to balance the earlier detail.Finally I'd saved the absolute worst aspect of this film for last, the the drip drip--go away not accurate ending. The mini series version carried that part off flawlessly.Hopefeully someone someday will do a film that will do justice to all the parts.",Dune
167,loufalce,Epic,9,6 September 2009,"I read the original book in the Dune series before I saw the movie, and I must say that David Lynch did a hell of a job and kept the film version fairly close to the book, In short this epic tale of a power struggle on the planet dune has Biblical, Shakespearian, Arthurian and modern political aspirations as its influences. Cast is quite excellent with Mac Laughlin a standout as Paul Atredies. Getting great support from an equally brilliant cast that includes among others Jose Ferrer, Jurgen Prochnow,Paul Stewart, Sting, Sean Young,and Linda Hunt this movie is not for everyone. It is quite literate and not a brain dead space shoot'em up. The spice mining scene where the harvester gets eaten up by the sand worm is magnificent,the spacecraft have a design combining art deco and Egyptian styles, the castles and interiors look medieval, the planet Dune features the gigantic sandworms that are as big as a cruise ship, and the planet Geidi Prime resembles an oil refinery.The desert scenes and battles are on par with Lawrence of Arabia and the film neatly ties up all the events for a satisfying conclusion. The big budget shows on screen and most of the situations seem believable. The only problems with the film is that the main characters inner thoughts are spoken in and over some of the main dialogue and a somewhat out of place rock music soundtrack really does nothing for the events. I kind of pictured a Maurice Jarre score, but I guess that you can't have everything. I can't see why Lynch is ashamed of this film. He has crafted an epic tale and even though it takes place on different planets thousands of years from now, it only shows how human nature and the quest to obtain power are universal themes that have not changed throughout time. The critics? Pay no attention to them. After all, they all loved the saccharine, plastic and ingtelligence insulting ""ET"", right?",Dune

Why messiah should come is more important than messiah himself. Minor detail maybe. Also it was weird that future messiah would say ""father I will seek revenge"". That's not a messiah. It has to be a Hollywood hero.Special effects are dated but very good. Its good to have OK visuals with good story than having just sleek visuals. The biggest problem of the film is Kyle MacLachlan.

172,The-Last-Prydonian,Despite overall decent performances and glorious production values this is a incomprehensible mess,2,11 January 2018,"Based on the first book in renowned sci-fi author; Frank Herbert's sprawling, epic saga; Dune was a project that had been through some considerable development going back as far as 1971. With Arthur P. Jacobs, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Ridley Scott separately vying to direct with their individual visions of how to bring the classic novel to life, executive producer Dino DeLaurentis eventually settled on hiring avant garde film-maker; David Lynch who had gained critical and commercial notoriety for his 1980 biographical period hit; The Elephant Man to helm the project. With a budget of $40 million (a costly sum for a big budget picture at the time) and fevered anticipation that came with the film, due to it's cult fan base there was a much riding on it's financial success. Lamentably however it was anything but; merely raking in $30.9 million at the world-wide box office after opening to scathing reviews which would later lead Lynch to distance himself from the movie; a cowardly move in my personal estimations given that being not only the director but acting as screenwriter in transferring the epic tale from page to screen. In short, the buck had to irretrievably end with him. At only 131 minutes in length with it's source material being 412 pages in length and embracing an insurmountable wealth of characters, too numerous to count ; even with it's opening introductory monologue from the entrancingly beautiful Virginia Madsen as Princess Irulan (daughter to the Emperor) laying the basic foundations of the plot; it does little to prevent if from descending in to incomprehensible pap. Many scenes involving much needed exposition, that would have laid out crucial plot details were clearly left discarded on the cutting room floor, and it was left to predominantly superlative cast of actors to bravely struggle to salvage any kind of discernible meaning from it. To their credit they for the most part give it their all; with Kyle MacLachlan admirably conveying the young Atredies heir personal dynamic from wide-eyed, cocky young buck to the self-confident, charismatic religious icon that is Muad'Dib with ease. With slightly varied support from Jürgen Prochnow as his noble, sage father with Patrick Stewart, Freddie Jones and Dean Stockwell offering further wise, informative words of counsel as members of the Atredies entourage. With Francesca Annis making a demure, reserved and assured presence as the Lady Jessica, mother and concubine to Paul and Duke Leto they neatly round up the caste of their home world of Caladan. Starkly contrasted via mainly decent turns from a range of actors that include the late Kenneth McMillan, the versatile Brad Dourif, Paul L. Smith and pop icon; Sting, they portray the insidious ruling member of the House Harkonnen. McMillan is a revoltingly repugnant presence as the corpulent Baron with Dourif a wily if relatively short lived addition as the deceitful and cunning Mentat; Piter defries. Smith is the dim-witted, brutish ( a fitting term seeing as he played Bluto in Robert Altman's cinematic live action version of; Popeye) ""Beast""; Glossu Rabban. Finally there Sting who aesthetically fits the role well with his sharply intense feature, slender frame topped with a fiery mane of red hair. Given the overall short screen time and minimal dialogue he had; he pretty much chews the scenery as he hams it up immensely. What you make of the acting depends I suppose on your personal predilections what with it's operatic, declamatory style but it's arguably one the few redeeming features; and there's very little beyond the phenomenal art deco and the spectacular grandeur of the planetary and intergalactic scenery. The editing is periodically ropy; a clear indicator where potentially vital scenes may have been dropped. It's only Toto and Brian Eno's evocative and spectacular score which resonates a mythological robustness in it's more bombastic moments; and a soothing tranquility in it's quieter moments that remind you that offers anything resembling relief from the tedium. The themes of religious fanaticism and political intrigue and corrupt machinations ultimately feel hollow, without enough meatiness to the narrative to fit the void that is woefully apparent. Not even some of the later scenes on Arrakis which include the then; and I suppose even now are impressively rendered; Giant Worm scenes offer much respite from the disjointed incomprehensibility. And that's including any key scenes with the native Fremen, which offer core exposition of Paul's journey in to manhood as he grows in to the position of religious messiah and warrior leader. Try as they might; co-stars Sean young as his future lover, the dutiful Chani (who is adequate enough) who and Everett McGill who fares better as her honourable and temperate father; the Bremen leader Stilgar can do nothing to elevate proceedings. A failure of monumental proportions; it has perplexingly gained some recognition given that it still manages to earn a moderately respectable score of 6.6 on IMDB; (god only knows why) Lynch even goes so far as to ignore some of the pertinent lore from the novel where upon he gives what is supposed to be a a rousing finale, but is contextually nonsensical. However with some much relevant information lost; I doubt many audience members with noticed or for that matter cared. And that concisely says it all.",Dune

It's incredibly weird, and that is what is so good about it, and it contains surrealist visual effects and picture-perfect cinematography, holding some of the most memorably weird moments in a movie I've seen in a long time. The special effects are brilliant yet strange, and although they may be a bit too weird for some I think others looking for a mind screw will love the uniqueness of this movie. It's a surreal space epic with an 80's soundtrack and an imagination that'll leave you gasping; I watch movies specifically to see weird things like this that I wouldn't see in real life and to be captivated into such a strange world like this is really interesting.

He gave Dune one star. How magnanimous! The movie doesn't make sense, he said. Rubbish. Not only is the movie a brilliant adaptation of an impossible book, an epic convoluted saga larger than all the epics of human history, but it manages to do it in a hypnotic cinematic style, the sort we now associate with Lynch. The visuals and the music are mesmerising. The cinematography and special effects totally respectful of the novel's sweeping vision. The huge cast do a brilliant job of fleshing out the characters, even the minor ones. The pace and editing are cracking. The basic story of the battle between the Harkonnen and the Atreides and their Fremen allies is crystal clear to any viewer paying attention, even without being familiar with the book.
I've yet to read a negative review by a professional critic that wasn't just full of spleen and devoid of any reference to the cinematic evidence in the actual film. The IMDB users have got the point of it and are far more reasonable in their assessment of the film.

Masterpiece and failure.The plot is bad. And the only reason is because it is lifted straight from the books. It is not so much a book adaptation as it is a lazy transcript. I have not read the books but it is obvious that there is a rich universe here, with intricate politics and sources of tension. The movie I guess has the main plot elements but it leaves too much out and has the rest left unanswered or underdeveloped.
You end up with too many characters, none of which matter really except for Paul and arguably his mother, in a story that is obscure and convoluted. There are too many characters for a plot this thin. I ended up not knowing who did what and why. The intricacies of the plot are too numerous. They are too heavy for the film/characters to lift. The movie wanted to be a masterly crafted puzzle with many pieces that reveal a beautiful texture (not unlike Game of Thrones); it ends up being an angry drawing made in a sharpie with a closed fist (eh, the good guys wins at the end).There is no clear structure in this movie either; it is difficult to see if any given situation is good or bad. Are the characters in danger? Are they in safety? Is this a moment of respite? Or is it another tense situation that will push the plot forward.The characters are bad. Half are caricatures, the other half are bland and forgettable. The bad guys are cartoons characters, how can anyone take them seriously? The good guys look the same, talk the same, act the same, and for some reason there is like 10 of them. Only when at the end of the movie fake-Marlon-Brando shows up again I remembered he existed (but I could not tell if it was good or bad).The protagonist is a shy teenager. It may work in literature. In cinema a good protagonist is someone you can relate to, someone you can trust. Someone you want to spend time with. A good protagonist needs to have a good set of values and relatable motivation to overcome the obstacle the plot throws at them.
Here we have a teenage power-fantasy vehicle. He is the wunderkind heir and by enormous tragedy, and injustice, becomes the saviour of the universe. He is an empty shell into which the reader could imprint himself or herself. On screen, it translates in the most boring plain white bread of a guy.
He is not even funny. Or smart. Or strong. He is just there. Same goes for his arch-nemesis Sting. Why did Sting hate the hero so much? Why is Sting so evil? The film provides no answer.Visually the film could have saved grace. It does not. Everything looks flat. The colours are muted. The camera is very static, it is filmed like a sitcom, lighting included. There are some neat stuff with the sandworms and the best shot might be when the sandworm eats the spice production plant. The weirdness or the costumes and the set design could balance it out. But it just compounds on the artificiality. Everything looks fake. Everything feels fake.Overall, the special effects and the visuals are not helping the movie. An early example is the personal shield fight scene. It is a neat idea but it is so jarringly strange. Before fighting, two opponents activate a shield around them which is meant to deflect bullets something? (It does not matter it will not be used in the film again) So it creates a blue rectangular opaque pixel screen around the characters, which makes it impossible to see them. Their motions, the expression on their faces.
That is Dune in a nutshell : A visual medium made useless, in the service of arcane gobbledygook that leads to nothing.They may be accurate and serviceable, but the movie really felt like it was made a decade earlier. Not every movie needs to be Star Wars, but when you are doing a futuristic space sci-fi it hurts to have a film that looks this outdated. If the movie was made in the 70s it would be fine. Not great, but acceptable. In 1984, especially after SW, it is just embarrassing.The best part of the movie is when it is over. At that point, it is clear that George Lucas is actually a genius merely by pulling off in Star Wars exactly everything what Dune attempted to.",Dune
179,robertmaybeth,"Flawed but still very adept telling of a very complicated story (SPOILERS, probably)",9,23 December 2017,"""Game of thrones"" in space, 12 years before it was ever written. We are told the rough cut ran 4 hours, Lynch wanted it to be at least 3 but the studio ordered it cut so as to allow more screenings in the theaters (a common thing in American cinema). But I have the impression the film would still have come out much the same regardless of the finished length... this film aims high, nearly achieves it yet ultimately can't achieve what the filmmakers set out to do. There's much to admire about this film and so many things about it that are ultimately pointless and frustrating. I had never read ""Dune"" so I had no expectations; even so it's clear there must be a lot of the book behind the dialogue and film elements. There's plenty of mythos present for ""game of thrones in space"" that it appears to be nowadays, and the film makers manage to convey a lot of it in a way that makes you want to know more. But that's the problem with this film adaptation - there's just enough back-story to make it a compelling watch but too little is adequately explained to make it satisfying. We have a classic rivalry with good guys (House Atreides) and bad guys (the emperor, House Harkonnen) along with a small but powerful group that will need to have it's loyalties adjusted (the Fremens) if the conflict (the fight for the vital spice ""Melange"" that grants its user almost magical powers). The good guys include Baron Atreides (Jurgen Prochnow) and his son Paul, (Kyle Machlachlan, making his film debut)squaring off against the evil (not to mention thoroughly vile) Baron Harkonnen and his trained killer Feyd Rautha (Sting, in a baffling but still convincing choice of casting). The Atreides must travel to the planet Arrakis, the only source of the vital spice in the universe. Little do they know the emperor and the Harkonnens have plotted to let them get settled on the planet then destroy them - particularly Paul, who the emperor has been ordered, (by some squishy squid villain or another that lives in a giant aquarium) to murder. All the elements for a great story are there, and for the most part, the film-makers live up to it. If oyu can ignore the often ponderous, pretentious and illogical dialogue, the voice overs that seem like they were written 5 minutes before the scene was shot, and the muddy continuity, this film delivers in a big way. There haven't been production values this good since ""Star Wars"", and the sets truly create the impression that we are looking at a totally different universe - and manages to sustain that for the entire film. And that's where they take you and leave you, since the story-telling can't live up to the rest of the film. All the elements of an epic story are in place...but where the film ultimately falls on its face is continuity. The characters all have clear motives, all are painted in appropriate shades of dark and light, and the film makers push every emotional button to make you root for team Atreides and against the evil Harkonnens. But sometimes the dialogue just doesn't work, and it doesn't help things when some of the characters deliver their lines as if they were reciting Shakespeare instead of having a simple conversation. In short, I really like this film, have rewatched it more then once, and wish it were better then it is. But the biggest problem with ""Dune"" is the murky telling of the story, and there are gaps a sand-worm could fit through.. You can't help the nagging idea that somehow, something got lost in translation during production. As it happens, audiences just couldn't relate to this film, which did so poorly at the box office that plans for two sequels were simply dropped (which is unfortunate, since you get the feeling that Lynch might have gotten the story right with just another sequel or two).",Dune
180,hotrobinproductions,"Boring, yet genius, yet all over the place",4,24 October 2021,"I tried okay... I didn't have to watch this movie to prepare for the new one which I heard is significantly better than this movie but I did.I figured why not give it a chance which I did. For what it is on paper it had every right to be an amazing film. The final product on the other hand just proves otherwise. It's a drag, a bore and so much more. I feel the author of the book is very disappointed in this movie. Things happen, characters have motives and it's got a clear direction but the problem lies in the execution. Just does not work and it becomes a complete laughing stock for me. Effects I usually never have issues with but boy... this was tough to look at. I've seen movies in the 50s pull off better effects but I won't knock a movie down for it... however I will expect something nice... i just think the time this movie was released was just not made in a time suit enough for its age. Everything is so confusing or just doesn't fit, reminds me of a blade runner / Star Wars /Star Trek combined into one kind of thing. Idk just weird I'm sure the book is 1,000,000 times better. And I'm looking forward to the new one.. I'm still glad I watched it... definitely picked up as the story progressed and had nice moments that picked up... but just went nowhere... 5/10 and this is on a good day... 4/10 average day.",Dune

Some of the scenes in the movie are really well made and it's clear alot of effort went into making it. However I found the whole thing very confusing. The story seemed to jump past important information and the editing just seemed terrible. They needed to build the story and engulf the viewer into the Dune world.

Prior to this I watched the original version just to prepare my self for the coming up remakeFirstly the comic sketches were too long and confusing even rewatching the front part I still could not understand it.. too fast and too confusing.. as the movie progressing Paul the main lead was introduced and everything kinda of fell into place... I understand the story and all the acting was superb.. the hatred when his father was killed and he was in exile all was acted accordingly... even the training and love story was okehThe CGI for the worm and costume was fantastic for the 80s all believable and hipThe things I don't like is the final battle scene too mediocre and need a lot of improvement.. I got a feeling they overspent in costume and puppets that they cut down on the CGI that make the final battle scene feels cheapKyle and Sting battle is also a downer. Alia scene was great.. hopefully with today's technology the new Dune might improve on the following..Will be watching the new Dune this weekend hopefully it won't disappoint and brings light to this underrated movieFinally a shout out to Max Von Sydow as Doctor Kynes.",Dune
184,eddiez61,Why I Enjoy this Odd Orphan of a Film...,9,13 July 2007,"A coherent, intelligible story, it seems, is essential for most people to consider a movie ""good."" Perhaps they're right, but I don't always watch movies for the story. Often, I watch for the spectacle. The unique, grand, outrageous, sublime visions of an inspired artist can be reason enough for me to devote 2 or 3 hours of precious personal time. As long as care and skill are evident in the creation of original, imaginative, provocative and wondrous vistas, then I'm on board. In fact, too often the ""story"" distracts from the pleasure of experiencing genuinely thrilling images. Alfred Hitchcock had a word for the story. He called it the ""MacGuffin."" The MacGuffin, he explained, is just a device, an excuse to explore character. Of course, he managed to tell excellent, worthwhile stories, too.Dune is visually spectacular. It's memorable. It's grandly outrageous sets, landscapes, costumes and get-ups are vividly etched in my mind. David Lynch has completely infused every aspect of the film's identity with his distinctive oddness. Every surface oozes his now familiar strangeness; every scene is a grand bizarre tableau. It's not quite as grandly heroic a vision as ""Star Wars"", but ""Dune's"" appearance is absolutely mesmerizing, disturbingly so. In fact, I found the true wonder and mystery of Herbert's book to be found abstractly in ""Dune's"" visual statements, and much less so than in any of its curiously arcane dialog and narration. The book's sprawling and quixotic plot defies translation to the screen, but the essence of the novel is its intense mood and atmosphere. These are absolutely, exquisitely captured by Lynch's stunning visuals.It's almost as though the tortuous story was intentionally made confusing to enhance the visual weirdness. How else could such an incomprehensible, jumbled, hectic, tedious script have gotten the green light? Lynch himself is mystified at its being OK'd by the studio. But that's a topic for another comment. I suppose it doesn't help to convince anyone of this film's worth by suggesting that you just turn down the sound - maybe play a U2 or Beck CD, but certainly not Toto! - and just marvel at the sights. That would just be TOO weird, huh? I had read the book about two years prior to seeing the film and therefor didn't need the plot clearly ""explained"". It seems it was very nearly enough that I was served a visual feast. ""Dune"" certainly is a lavishly exotic alien banquet, a bizarre cinematic smörgåsbord of transcendent sights. Most people and critics didn't recognize what was on this alien menu, had no appetite for its peculiar cuisine. Though they were anticipating magical flavors, the world just couldn't stomach ""Dune's"" intense blend of rare visual spice, but I did. I ate it up.",Dune
185,Denver53,This never could have lived up to expectations,7,5 September 2000,"I confess: I liked Dune. Part of the reason why is that I saw it by myself one snowy, mid-week night in college, with nothing else to do, and was in the perfect frame of mind for a movie with this kind of complex backstory. I also liked it because of its majesty, though that majesty frequently borders on awe and tends to make the viewer feel as if he/she is being told to worship the screen instead of enjoy a movie.If you haven't read Dune (and its sequels), you are in for a treat. But you'll learn while reading it so many things that the movie only hints at, and many other things that the movie ignores completely (i.e. in the Book Baron Harkonnen is a wily political adversary with a mean streak, not simply a gross man only semi-sane) ... (by the way, if you want to know how the Baron morphed from a perfect phsysique to the gross one, read the relatively new House Atreides book by Brian Herbert). Ultimately, Dune the movie had so much material to sort through from Dune the book, it had very little chance to succeed. That said, the movie's practice of having the thoughts of various characters abruptly whispered out loud as you look at their still faces was needless and in vain. The whispered comments rarely said more than a good glance would, and quickly became annoying.Still, there is *something* about Dune that is arresting. It might be the scale of Arrakis, the worms, and the political feuding between Houses. It might be the oddly 19th-century look of the Great Houses. It might be the sometimes stirring musical score. Or maybe my mind just fills in the blanks with knowledge I learned in the book.In any case, if you can get by the whispered thoughts and the often stilted dialogue (which comes from taking lines *directly* from the book and inserting them into the movie, never a good practice), you might find Dune interesting. I wonder what the movie might have been if it had continued the vision obvious in the sets into the dialogue and plot, instead of being a half-homage to the book. I guess we won't know ... unless the mini-series coming up on The Sci-Fi Channel in December delivers. I rated Dune a 7.",Dune
186,jillbeckinheim7,Complex film but classic,7,26 October 2021,"To put it mildly, Dune is not a very simple film to digest in any denomination. Unlike Star Wars, there aren't any quick starship battles or bits of comic relief. But it does fit into that pantheon of science fiction films that shouldn't be tossed away completely. Here in even one of Lynch's least successful works, maybe his fault in some respects and not in others, there's a lot of brilliant and sensational moments and sights and sounds. There's something striking about how the film is presented, and sometimes how it takes off, that keeps it from not sinking into the otherwise likely situation of an epic running totally off the tracks. And as a general admirer of science fiction the writing that backs up this work from Herbert is not completely lost on me. At least for one thing about the film is certain- this is the only time on celluloid that you'll witness a knife fight between, yes, Sting and Kyle MacLauchlan. In short, DEFINITELY not for everyone.",Dune
187,PeachesIR,"Ambitious for the '80s, but ages poorly",6,5 October 2021,"I saw this David Lynch version of ""Dune"" as a teenager in the '80s. At the time, I remember thinking that some of the special effects looked shabby--they have aged very poorly now that we have more sophisticated graphics capabilities.However, the strength of ""Dune"" is the story and characters, the human messages of love and loyalty, lust for power, prophecy, religion, treachery, depravity, greed, idealism, etc. That comes through quite well.Kyle MacLachlan is good as the young hero Paul Atreides, and probably doesn't get enough credit for his performance. Jurgen Prochnow and Francesca Annis are both good as Paul's loving parents, Leto and Jessica. Supporting parts are played by seasoned actors, including Patrick Stewart, Sian Phillips, Kenneth McMillan, Jose Ferrer, Richard Jordan, Linda Hunt, Brad Dourif and Dean Stockwell. However, some of the performances now come off as either too stiff, stagey or too hammy. Sting appears as villainous Feyd and reminds you why he stuck to music. Sean Young, a rising star at the time, isn't given much to do as Chani except look lovely and in love with Paul (who wouldn't be?).I think this version of ""Dune"" was very ambitious for its time, and it's interesting to watch, but it comes off as very dated and out of step with modern tastes and mores.",Dune

Dune, however, is just too big of a story to make one movie out of. Two or three 2 hour movies might have made more sense. The best thing to do is read the book.

I was mostly disappointed with the movie at the time. If you never read the book you would not know what's going on, even with the glossary handout. I read the original Dune trilogy and so I realized that so much was missing, and there were odd little additions that were in the film but not in the books, which mostly were not effective. I just watched this same Dune on DVD and am impressed that the look is still very acceptable, unlike other films whose production styles ages them badly. I appreciated the movie more for what it was, which is more of a Readers' Digest Dune. A lot of important characters are marginalized in the film, and several notable scenes are missing. A film that had more of the detailed world of Dune and all of its characters would take 6-8 hours. The Harkonnens are overdone and overacted but you do get the idea that they are despicable. Comparing the 1984 movie with the 2000 version, I thought the movie captures the spirit better, while the newer version is more thoughtful and loyal to the original fiction.",Dune

192,roystephen-81252,Poetic surrealism,9,23 February 2016,"I had read Frank Herbert's SF classic before I saw David Lynch's adaptation and since I grew up with Star Wars, I had always envisioned the world of Dune as something similar to that. However, I was not unfamiliar with Lynch's other works either (I had seen Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart up to then) so I sort of knew what to expect. Something different. Something unique.And that's exactly what you get with Lynch's take on Dune. It is strikingly different from how most readers would imagine the novel put on the screen. It's bizarre and unsettling, yet, in a weird way, stunningly beautiful and poetic. And though at the time people were reluctant to accept this surreal, baroque nightmare as a faithful adaptation of Herbert's novel, interestingly, Sci-Fi Channel's new version in 2000 basically followed Lynch's designs, too, proving how memorable and influential his vision had become in the interim years. As it turns out, Lynch redefined Dune.Lynch's Dune is a miscast, chaotic mess with gross moments and a lot of cheap, outdated effects (even for its time), but it has a spellbinding vision. It's a truly unique work of art and it should be appreciated as such. I love it.",Dune
193,fxdx4,A quick review 35 years later,6,1 January 2020,"I re watched Dune 35 years after it first came out, and I will share my thoughts. I re watched it because of the board game funny enough. When I first watched it as a kig, I found it fairly boring with some good scenes and action.Director David Lynch tried to tell this epic tale as closely as he could, however the main flaw of the film is that it tried to encompass too much and therefor does nothing overly well. Prophecy, love story, deep back story, magic powers, political intrigue, war. You name it and this film has a little bit of it, but not enough of any one thing.The story itself is a classic revenge tale, but what makes the books stand out is the rich tapestry of characters and politics. Very similar to what makes Game of Thrones stand out from most fantasy stories. Epic houses, betrayal, complex plans are all in the film, but there is never enough time to explain what and why things happen the way they do.So as a stand alone film it fails, but as an adaption to those who know the story it has some merit. This should make you want to read the books or hope for better story telling from the 2020 Dune film upcoming.The cast is fantastic, and it is fun to see a youn(ger) Patrick Stewart, along with the 6-7 other famous faces who often are small parts in the film.The special effects have aged, but were top notch, and the scope of the effects they attempt is impressive. The action is fair, but seems slow compared to the action of today's films.All in all, this is a film worth watching as long as you are a fan of Dune and understand the story better than the film itself does. It tries to do too much, which is a credit and the curse of this film. Too many characters, too much story, too many moving parts creates a messy and somewhat dull story that confuses.Sci-fi fans should view this as they may go to a museum to view a piece of old art, not to necessarily enjoy, but to appreciate.",Dune

Other than that, the entire movie is one big mess, with a whole lot of jumping around from scene to scene. A lot of the flashbacks don't even make sense, and are extremely repetitive. The whole movie is filled with annoying inner monologue. The special effects are cheap-looking and corny. Not to mention that the whole thing is insanely long. I could not watch this movie in one sitting if I tried. The first time I saw it, it took me a good 5 tries to watch it all the way through.The characters in the film are all boring, and I was not interested in any of them.

198,rogier-86785,"Kitschy, Flawed but Cool and Tacky",5,2 November 2021,"Having also reviewed the recent Villenue film Dune, I thought it only fair to give the 1984 adaptation by David Lynch a go as well.Of course, it shouldn't surprise you that this is in no way a good film. It's a Lynch-fuelled attempt to capture the suffocating Dune story, which means plenty of weirdness, grand and eloborate stages, and strange monstrosities. It mostly fails, but also succeeds. And although plenty can be said about the script being uneven compared to both the book and Villenueve's masterpiece, it does suit this universe.It's visceral. For instance, the Duke of Harkonnen is truly disgusting and hideous, just like in the book. It doesn't really work, but somehow does feel accurate, even if it doesn't follow the book to the letter or feels off.It does however, feel very dated, and that's the main critique. Plenty of other scifi films from that era have stood the test of time much better (Bladerunner anyone?), especially in special effects in space, which are bad here even for its time. Also, there is plenty of exposition. Maybe back then this wouldn't have mattered as much, since a lot of explaining needed to be done, but looking at it now, even if it feels forgiveable, it still feels deeply lacking. It gives this expensive film a cheap feel, as if we're watching the kitschy Conan the Barbarian all over again. It's fun, but super tacky. A bit of a guilty pleasure, if you could call any of Lynch his work a pleasure.This does of course, all make it an interesting watch. It's weird, because it's basically not a good film, but it's acted out really well, albeit a little too theatrical, by its star-stutted cast. That too, makes it kinda cool to see. It's an actors uphill battle against the kitsch, but they do make it up that hill. The cinematography and set pieces are equally cool, and so is the general atmosphere and the music.Maybe it's unfair, but looking at it now, it's a cool, creative but deeply flawed film that just hasn't stood the test of time and fails to capture the darkness of the Dune universe. Yet, strangely, it also succeeds in it because of Lynch his typical choices and suspense building.All in all, it's not a good film, and really not recommended if you just feel like a good watch. But if you're a film buff, or just want to be awed by a weird cult classic, it's worth a go.",Dune
199,MyOpinionIsFact,Hard Core Sci-fi,8,15 December 1999,"I first tried to watch this movie somewhere around 1985 when I was about 9. My attention kept waning and I barely remembered the story afterwards. However, the images of giant worms and that freaky little girl were forever stuck in my mind from the experience. Over the years I tried to watch it a couple more times but always either couldn't finish it or fell asleep. Then I tried the novel upon the suggestion of my friends... got halfway through it. That was more than 10 years ago. Then, last night, I decided to watch the movie again with determination to finish it. I did. My impression was that the movie was good, not great. The drawbacks are also its strengths if that makes any sense. The plot is incomprehensible yet at the same time it adds a sense of epic proportions to the movie. The effects are dated yet it must be remembered that for the time they were pretty good. The musical score seems detached but still fits in somehow.[The electric guitar when Paul rides the worm to me was the most unusual] By far the best part of this movie is the visuals. The people with blue eyes, the flying baron, the little girl, and the worms are something that few people would quickly (ever?) forget. For this reason, I recommend the movie. 8/10",Dune

Whichever word you pick you won't be wrong. But, it matters not, for whatever word you pick, your mind will always desire to go through it one more time. And the more you see it, the more you want it. Perhaps that's true for most David Lynch films. They torture you but somehow you enjoy it and always crave for more.David Lynch took a very difficult task. To convert a novel, with a cartload of characters in it, each with their own different agendas joined in an immense and perplexing plot, into a 137-minute-long movie (190 minutes later, when it was adapted for TV). For that the film suffers (as always when you have to deal with book-to-film adaptations). As a result the film seems more like a slideshow than an actual film. We go through the story, covering the most basic plot lines in small autonomous scenes, that try to get the viewer acquainted with the characters and the storyline. It can be confusing. However, if you are not a mindless drone, and you understand some basic stuff about sci-fi, you can understand what's going on without having to read the novels. The film throws at you several pseudotechnical terms, names and places, but not without ensuring you understand what are the premises of the universe the story takes place in, as well as the relationships between the characters and the planets. Especially after the first half, the film seems to rush to the end, going through the events of about 5-6 years in a summary. This can be annoying for the usual movie-goer, and a weakness for the film, but it's not that bad if you try to fill in the gaps yourself using your imagination.What the film does particularly well is in how it submerges the viewer into what they see in front of them. It manages to give you the feeling that you are not actually watching a movie. It's more like watching a theatrical play, while having the book it's based on read to you. Most movies rely on weird , cheesy and cliché dialogues between the characters to describe their feelings, thoughts and the plot to the viewer. What Dune does instead, is it relies more on the characters' mental voices, i.e. that voice that talks in your mind when you are thinking, and lets you know what they are thinking and feeling, while at the same time dialogues are written to be more realistic, the interactions are made to be more real. At the same time, the ""bad guy"" and his minions, are not given mental voices or they rarely have them, which sets them apart from the rest of the characters. Instead they are made to gloat, and their thoughts are seen more through their intense actions, which makes the viewer despise them even more. In conjuction with the great acting, this leaves a sweet taste in your mouth.The other great thing about the film is the atmosphere it has. An amazing baroque atmosphere at that. If you are a Warhammer 40K fan, then you are gonna love the palaces, the scalpted ships, the uniforms, the speech. The soundtrack is not something that stands out, but whenever you hear it, you can feel the hairs on your skin standing up. The effects, although very limited in their technology and apparently in their funding, manage to deliver greatly. The gigantic worms inspire awe and terror in your heart, the battle scenes are brutal and gritty.So yeah, in summary, you are gonna find yourself discomforted by the whole way the film is presenting itself, mainly because of the slideshow-y screenplay (and some disturbing images David Lynch throws in the mix whenever he can, as he usually does), but once you get past that and understand that what you are watching is not a film in contemporary terms and you can't be as a passive audience as other films let you be, but rather you have to let your imagination and thinking loose, then you are in for a ride of sheer awesomeness. If you haven't read the Dune novels yet, then this film will make you want to rush to the library and get them.My rating is an 8/10, but it's rewarded only because of how the film made me feel and the sweet taste it left in my mouth. I can't rate this the way I'd rate a regular film, so don't take it in seriousness. However, at the end of the day, I do wish that more films based on books were presented in the way Dune does.",Dune
201,benowen-91207,(Nearly) So bad it's good,2,26 September 2021,"Dune (the Novel) is one of my all time favourite books and is a true master class of Sci-Fi story telling. It's story on paper is simple yet Herberts execution of such ideas fills the universe with insanely dense detail.Unfortunately we are not talking about the book. Lynch's adaptation of Dune might actually be one of my least favourite movies for butchering the source material, but at the same time I hold a certain dual opinionated mindset on this film, as this film is absolutely hilarious. It almost gives a pass to the story changes and scenes cut out, both of which add SO much to the original.But it's hard to call this film so bad it's good, because in truth it's just terrible. The weird part is that it takes a nosedive in quality around the (spoiler) Harkonnen invasion of arrakis. Up until then, it was goofy sure, but it still felt COHESIVE.""How did it occur? For he is the Kwizat Haderach!"" Might just be one of the most insulting and terrible lines of dialogue I have ever heard in film with the contextOverall, if you are a fan of Dune, I'd recommend if you like a good disasterpiece, but even then, you might notice your soul be extracted from your body when you hear the characters use the voice (again, completely different and more interesting in the book)2/10

202,sashamyshkina,Why does everyone hate this?,9,26 March 2021,"I have read Frank Herbert's incredible novel, and I went into this with mixed expectations after seeing it hailed as Lynch's only failure. However, I do not understand all of the criticism.I liked it. That is the first and foremost point I would like to make. I'm well aware that Lynch took considerable creative liberties whilst making this, but I think that the film still had the feel and style of the book. Of course some plot lines were cut: you have 600+ pages of material here. I was never expecting everything from the novel to make it onto the screen. However, I think that there was a beautiful transition between the book and this - the movie felt almost identical to what I envisioned it to be in my head as I as reading. It would have been even better if Lynch was allowed to make a trilogy, or even just two films, as that would convey Dune in its entirety.Now for the thing that stood out to me the most whilst watching Dune: the effects. The number one problem directors encountered in the 1970s and 1980s is the lack of technology needed to create sci-fi environments such as the once in Dune. However, this is so perfectly achieved here that I was completely blown away. I mean, I'm not saying that the effects were completely flawless, there were a few sliiiightly questionable moments, but for the most part - especially the sandworms - were incredibly done. This film, as well as 1982's Blade Runner, redefined the sci-fi neo-noir genre.This film is weird. I mean, it's David Lynch, so I was expecting strangeness, but this, combined with Herbert's world, is a level of camp I thought couldn't feasibly be achieved. But having such a beautifully bizarre masterpiece is thousands of times better than having another mindless, CGI-fest Star Wars movie. Honestly, I'm very glad I read the book first, and I highly encourage anyone else to do the same, as otherwise the plot will be pretty much incomprehensible. This was the first of Lynch's films I watched, and its unique and beautiful strangeness is what made me want to see everything else he has made (that worked out very well - I am currently obsessed with Twin Peaks).In conclusion, watch this movie. Read the book, then watch it. Does not deserve any of the hate it receives.-Sasha.",Dune
203,midniteprincess,send this movie into a Black Hole !!,1,24 June 2001,talk about your confusing movies.. this one had me lost from start to finish.. BORRINGGG is all i can say... i saw this stinker cause i like Sting and Kyle .. but why did they do this one for ??????  Sting is a good actor.. but he sure made a mistake doing this crapperoo of a picture....in all this time ive never figured out this one.. good thing the ticket prices werent too high back when this came out.. cause NO way would i put out $12.50 for this garbage.. i'd advise anyone NOT to rent this movie.. save your money for something better.. and who'd need novacaine when all they'd have to do is just watch this junk and they'd be right out of it !! i kinda wished i had been too when i first saw it!!!!!!!!!1,Dune
204,kellindil-759-448828,not great but had some vibe,6,20 June 2020,"Vibe is pretty close to book, but story is heavily altered to match Lynch fantasies. Ridiculous at times, poor battle and fight scenes but still some visualisations became legendary",Dune
205,azcowboysingr,Loved this film...hated the book!,10,15 May 2009,"First, let me state that I really love this film...it is one I never tire of watching. I have both versions, the long one & the short one, & I usually watch them both, one behind the other. Yes, that makes for a very long night, but I'm retired so I have more time than anything else. Secondly, I tried to read the books, but got so bored about 1/3 of the way through the first one that I just gave it up as a bad job. Third, I cannot understand why so many people disliked this movie. It has a superb cast, wonderful music, great costumes (although what was with the designer of the Emporer's daughter's dresses...is that girl really that flat chested???), stunning set designs, and excellent stunt work. Fourth, While the SFX do look sort of cheesy by today's standards, if taken in the context of 1984's technology, they are very well done. You simply cannot judge SFX done almost 30 yrs. ago by what was done in LOTR, or any of the newer, big budget sci-fi films. That's saying an apple is just like an orange...they are not the same. I may be in the minority opinion, but I rank this film very highly on all counts.",Dune
206,JG2001,Dune is a classic.,10,3 October 1999,"Many people don't believe this, but Dune is a classic piece of film making. It has an artistic style all its own. To really get the full effect, I suggest that you watch the TV expanded ""Alan Smithee"" version the next time it airs or if you can find it at a video rental. It attempts to capture the complexity of the novel, which is a very difficult task, and should be applauded for the hard work.If you don't believe me, then perhaps you may want to check out the Sci-Fi Channel's six hour Dune mini-series coming to television in a couple of years.",Dune
207,nealklein,"Oh ... my God, was this strange!",4,23 October 2000,"When I think about ""Dune"" I get a funny sort of feeling, like the tension in a muscle before it hits charley-horse pain levels. It's more of a terror, really. Because this movie was so great and bad at the same exact time.Let's be clear. For its time, it was pretty groundbreaking, and it has the look and cast of an expensive epic. The sets and details are rich and amazing. It looks like the production on the film alone is worth writing a book about the stages of development. The acting was sincere and strong and wonderful in places. And Lynch really tried to do some justice to the book while making ""Dune"" a creation of his own.But it's lacking in many places. And what it does not lack, it more than diminishes itself through the use of poor pacing and bad storytelling devices. What do I mean? Where would one begin?There is, of course, the ""this is what I'm thinking"" device used throughout the film. Instead of saying what they are thinking as an aside, the actors give their best facial expressions while their disembodied voice states their thoughts explicitly. Now, I thought this might actually be necessary to tell the entire story. After all, ""Dune"" is not a linear tale. There's an entire universe to set up for the audience. But this distracting device is overused and laughable after awhile. Kudos to David Lynch for trying it out. But he only gets an A for effort.The acting is good. It really is. But the characters tend to come across as flat and pretentious. Would you care to meet Leto or Paul Atreides? Or Gurney? Or the Shadout Mapes? Flat out, I can state that I did not care enough about these characters to be affected by their deaths and suffering.
Some characters are just ridiculous. Paul's mutant sister, Baron Harkonnen, Feyd, the Shadout Mapes, and Piter DeVries are so over the top that I hear myself spoofing them in my head before the film is over. And these are talented and mostly experienced actors who portray them. (Even Sting --- watch ""Brimstone and Treacle"" if you don't believe me.)And of course, there's the attempt of trying to tell a six hour tale in a two hour movie. I've seen the four hour version, and it still does little at correcting the mistakes I noted above. The result is a confusing and beautiful looking mess.You have two ways to see this movie. Either you see it in the serious way in which it was intended, or you laugh A LOT at the screen. I recommend at least giggling.",Dune
208,uroshnor54,An Okay Adaptation,6,21 April 2014,"There was once a time when I would have said that Dune was better than any of the Star Wars movies. It's not, though. When I first watched it, I thought it was amazing. I mean, I loved the sandworms and stuff. But this is really not a very good adaptation. It did get me to read the book, though, so that's a good thing. Honestly, I don't think David Lynch is completely at fault here. The book is good but not excellent. Frank Herbert's writing isn't the best. He should have cut down on the inner thoughts of characters. Still, I think the movie is pretty entertaining but I have mixed feelings on everything. The special effects are really dated. The climax is the worst part. It looks unfinished. But the worms are great. The sets are great. Just look at the tiles in the Grand Palace of Arrakeen. They look worn, as if they've been there for generations. The interior of the castles on Caladan look great. I hate the spaceship designs. And I think the sonic weapons are really dumb. Sting was actually okay. I liked his enthusiasm (""I WILL kill him."") even if he was kind of silly at times. Kyle MacLachlan looks exactly like how Paul is described in the book. Francesca Annis is very beautiful as Lady Jessica but she kind of overacts, even more than Sting.At least the stillsuits actually look like stillsuits, though. You just have to watch the miniseries to truly appreciate the stillsuits here. Actually, everything here is far better than in the miniseries. Seriously, don't even watch the miniseries. I don't care if it's more accurate. (It's really not that much more accurate than the movie). The budget for the miniseries was just too low and it shows. David Lynch at least got the feel of the book right, for the most part. It's just that special effects weren't advanced enough. Not nearly advanced enough. This is one movie that could really use a remake.",Dune
209,picturetaker,"Impressive sets, interesting idea for a movie but yeah it also sucked.",3,13 May 2011,"I have never seen this movie until today, the day of this review. But I have learned long ago, never to compare movies from before CGI to CGI movies. So what I have to say about this movie, is based on the movie and would be the same if I saw it in the theater when it came out in the 80's.It was very impressive. The sets, the costumes, and even some of the effects for the 1980's. The idea for this movie was a good idea too. And I suppose if you were totally deaf, it would have been a fantastic movie. But since I can hear, I also heard the script, or lack of it.There were SO SO SO SO SO many holes in the story. I am unsure if it was simply bad editing, or too long, or just a terrible script but I suspect it is all three. If you found yourself saying ""What?"" while watching this movie then you know exactly what I mean.Because even the final battle seemed to end in the middle of it and the next scene all the ""bad guys"" were captured. Or there was a lady at the beginning with such a beautiful voice but they never tied her really into the story either. Or there was the large amounts of water, that were never explained. Oh man so many things! There were so many holes in the plot and story of this movie that I started getting bored because I didn't know what was going on and I am a movieoholic! Though I know likely only a handful of people will ever read this review, if you have seen this movie then you know what I am talking about. It was a great and amazingly produced movie but the lack of a good story made it looooong and boring. I give this movie 3 out of 10 only because I liked the production value of this movie. Other then that, I likely will never watch this movie again.",Dune
210,Stu-42,A brutal report of this ghastly mess,2,12 June 2004,"I just watched this movie after all this time. I skipped it at the theater and never got around to viewing it- until now that is. The bad reviews kept me away and now I can see why the buzz was so negative. This was without a doubt one of the worst films of all time. Absolutely laughable acting, dialogue and yes- even special effects at times. There were some nice sets and Von Sydow is always good, but apart from that- sickeningly bad actually. I was surprised to see something that would make ""The Fifth Element"" look like brilliant, wonderful cinema. I remember liking the book and the characters in it. Why were the characters in the movie so terribly unlikable? Notably Paul, but honorable mention goes to De Vries, The Baron and Dr. Wellington. Since some really good people were cast, I think the blame has to go to Lynch on this one. He has outdone himself which is saying a lot considering the awful and awfully overrated ""Blue Velvet.""",Dune
211,klottese,Netflix ... eh,3,5 May 2020,"Is it a good movie or not? The people writing here are the uber fans. Comparing this detail to that bla bla. Who cares? Are you all professionals who need to show off your knowledge?It's got some serious actors but I fell asleep after the first 5 minutes. The low voices, stiff bodies, and the pace just knocked me right out. You know how the 1970s Star Wars is still great and fun to watch? Well this just isn't. Names like Jessica and Paul in an ultra futuristic setting. We are still talking from the Bible? No way! Ugh!Twin Peaks or Star Trek 1st Generation, The Police, now all of that is fun to watch... sorry David I wanted to love this, I just can't. ...",Dune
212,stiv-7,"Love this movie, but get your facts straight.",8,8 March 2001,"Let me just say, first and foremost, that the 190 minute cut of Dune is NOT David LYNCH'S DIRECTOR'S CUT! As is mentioned elsewhere on this site, that cut is credited to Alan Smithee, a pseudonym used when a director no longer wants to be associated with the film in question. In this case, MCA went ahead and created its own longer version in order to sell it into TV syndication as a miniseries. Lynch had nothing to do with it. He had, on various occasions, expressed a desire to recut the film into a 3 1/2 hour cut, but was never given the chance. It would be nice if Universal would be considerate enough to give him that opportunity, but at this point, I seriously doubt he would jump at the chance. 'Nuff said.Having said this, I love this version of Dune. Being unable to penetrate Herbert's lugubrious prose at the time of the film's release (I was only 13), I was in awe of Lynch's sumptuous visual sense (ably aided by the brilliant Freddie Francis) and the calibre of acting involved. Kyle MacLachlan, in his film debut, creates a strong screen presence as Paul, and is surrounded by some of the world's finest actors of stage and screen. This is a movie to completely lose yourself in, and succeeds in creating an alternate universe where others are limited by lame storytelling and cheesy special effects. And, as another user said, the music ROCKS! Brian Eno's Prophecy theme is brilliant, and hold up a lot better than, say, Vangelis' music for ""Chariots of Fire"". However, if you need to have things blow up in your face every 2 minutes, do the rest of us a favour; quit your whining about this visual masterpiece and go rent some piece of populist fodder like ""Armageddon"" instead.",Dune

215,ranwulfs,"So bad, so bad...",1,22 April 2012,"I saw this in '84 when it first arrived in theaters - and I thought it sucked then. Jump ahead almost 30 years and I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt and watch it again. It didn't age well, but at least the suckage is consistent. David Lynch was a weird choice for director. Period. Most of his films since this have proved that he, like Tarantino, thinks he's a total genius when in reality he's merely a self-indulgent well financed poseur who has manged to fool some of the people all of the time. And whoever made the decision to have constant damned ""voice overs"" so that we, the obviously too stupid viewers can be spoon-fed every attempt at subtext, should have been tossed over the edge of the nearest convenient cliff. Of course, it was probably Lynch. I hear there's a re-boot in pre-production as I (figuratively) speak: whoever's behind it has my heartfelt best wishes. Nothing could be as bad as this POS.",Dune

But after 20 minutes I started to enjoy it, and midway through I really liked it.It is more of a fantasy rather than a sci-fi, with an excellent story, great sets and costumes, although the special effects were a bit hokey at times. Dune has many fine actors such as Jose Ferrer and Max Von Sydow. Give it a try, it is worth a look.",Dune
217,Tobeshadow,Thoroughly deserves its cult status!,8,4 November 2021,"One of my first introductions to the wonderful world of David Lynch, Dune truly is a science fiction epic. The sheer amount of material brought to the screen is phenomenal and the colours, production design and effects, though a little dated now, are spectacular.The story is dense, and to audiences accustomed to Star Wars at the time it was always going to be a difficult sell. It's a real shame that Lynch fell out so badly with the producers and that the theatrical cut was missing so many of the additional scenes he had filmed. I really wish the producers had been bold and allowed a 180 minute+ cut of the movie, complete with an intermission. It truly would have made this one of the most unique and epic sci-fi films of all time.While the later TV version of Dune adds back many of the lost scenes, the lack of post-production and sloppy editing that so upset Lynch really detracts from the promise of an extended cut. The 'Spice Diver' fan-edit online is perhaps the closest one can get to seeing what might have been.Even in its theatrical form, Dune is still a unique and important entry in the science fiction genre. I really enjoyed Denis Villeneuve's take, and I think it will work very well over two films, but Lynch's original will always be the one I saw first and the one that speaks to me more.",Dune

219,Chris_Ego,My thoughts after revisting Dune (1984) 25 years after the first time of watching,6,8 May 2021,"I was glad to see ""Dune"" (1984) popping up on Netflix just before the release of the new Dune film by Denis Villeneuve in 2021. Since the 2 hour version was available, I instantly clicked on it. All I remembered from the first time watching Dune in the 90s was that it lasted way too long. Also I didn't like the slow pace, the visual representation and the story. A pretty bad premise for tuning in again, I would say.To my very surprise I found so many good aspects about my revisit of this David Lynch film. Firstly some personal notes: it was released in the year when I was born (oh yes, and so many other positive things happened in that fabulous year!). Sting plays a villain (I totally forgot he was in the cast!). And the orchestral score was recorded in Vienna (where I live). That's just nice!The other reviewers mentioned that ""Dune"" flopped at its original release because the audience wanted another ""Star Wars"" movie. And that is an interesting point of view. You have to dig this ""Dune"" film in relation. It is not another Sci-Fi spacetime flick and it does not feature fancy space ships or flashy looking aliens. As the book from author Frank Herbert suggests, the story is about much more. He covers politics, economy, religion, values and spiritual questions. I read the new graphic novel and I have to say I was drawn into the story of the movie pretty much because of that book. The visual representation of this Dino De Laurentiis production sure enough was an inspiration for the drawings. And a lot of the dialogues have been taken directly from Herbert's book into the screenplay. It is just lovely to see the cast acting out on it. Maybe you have to read the book to indulge the movie?The villains around the Baron behave extremly peculiar and repulsive. You hardly see a similar performance in today's movies. Here the villains in general have a repulsive aura. The good guys always shine, even when they murder the bad guys. This separates good from evil visually. I don't know if David Lynch did all this on purpose it works well for me.The greenscreen, CGI and the stop-motion action were pretty bad even at that time the movie came out. I read that there was just not enough time to do that properly and there were lots of fights about the production design and the length of the movie. So let's put that into account and focus on other mentionable stuff.The soundtrack is from Brian Eno and Toto. Yes! Listen to it separatly and enjoy a blend of ""Spartacus"" and electric guitars.Even in the shorter 2 hr version the movie is compelling. Towards the end everything seems rushed, but that made the final fight more exciting. I didn't need further explanation of Paul's journey. They don't beat arount the bush here. It's a funny sidenote, that Herbert says at the end of the Making-Of ""Destination Dune"", the audience will wonder what was left out in the movie. Yeah, a lot. Little did he know on set.All in all you get some Lynch'eske trance cutscenes, ""spiiiice!"", Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck and some thoughtful quotes to ponder. Did God create this planet to train the faithful? Hm...Even if David Lynch admitted this to be his worst movie, he got introduced to Kyle MacLachlan, and that led to something fruitful, right?",Dune
220,black_wolf_1970,Good movie but did not do Hubert justice,7,15 March 2005,"When I saw this movie I had not yet read his book, when I id I was appalled on how much was left out of this movies, how many of the characters were changed or modified for political correctness. I have to say while I loved this movies it should not have been done as one movie, it should have been done as it was latter on by SCI-FI channel as a series of movies so that more of the original feel of the book could be felt, as a big screen feature it could have been more graphic, and exact, as even the SF channel feature still left much to be desired in the film. versus the book but it is a sill a good film to see.. But I will say to get the full story and the real effect from the story go to the local book store and pick up a caopy and read the book. This may be a hard thing to do in this day and age but reading is still sometimes a good thing to do and a few hours away from a computer, ot screen will not kill any one I swear.",Dune
221,vfrickey,Still the best adaptation of the Frank Herbert classic....,9,13 April 2006,"Very possibly the best thing to be produced by the de Laurentiis dynasty, this movie is, admittedly, a bit over the top all the way through - possibly why David Lynch listed his directorial duties under the pseudonym ""Alan Smithee"" - NOT the ""mark of quality,"" people who are ashamed of the film they helped make generally have themselves listed as ""Alan Smithee"" on the credits - Gore Vidal did it for ""Caligula"" for excellent reasons. (Seeing a later edition of this version of ""Dune"" on a satellite channel, I notice that Lynch's name has since gone back on the credits and the cartoon storyboard intro has been replaced by a more aesthetic reading of the background by Virginia Madsen - as Princess Irulan reading from the Manual of Muad'Dib, in the spirit of the novel - a much better approach).However, some stories demand a bit of over-the-topness, and this is one of them. Certainly, this adaptation beats Sci-Fi channel's understated and more than slightly soporific version all to Hell. Pseudo-sotto voce self-talk on the part of the main characters and everything, this version of Dune is very faithful to the tone of the novel. This may be why this movie's not everyone's favorite flavor, because the book isn't, either. Without going into either a plot synopsis or spoiling anything, it seems as though serious artistic trade-offs were considered and made throughout the film. I like it very much - if anything, it exceeded the expectations Herbert's novel raised when I read it back in the 1970s.Brian Eno's score was definitely above and beyond expectations - in line with the melodramatic tone of the movie and adding to the frissons and feeling of awe generated by the sweeping vistas and masterful directing. While there is a little unintentional comedy created by the Padishah Emperor and his staff using what look like video game consoles to direct the defense of the Harkonnen redoubt from the fedayeen, viewing the film over twenty years later we realize that modern war has a certain amount of video-gameness to it - and as gritty as war in the streets still is, it is inexorably moving toward what we see in those late scenes in ""Dune."" The only way to remove that one bit of unintentionally comic tone would have been to contradict the directorial decision to go for visual and auditory grandeur all the way through the film - have the defense scene be low-key and consciously patterned after what happens in real combat and mission control rooms. The director elected to stay with the overarching theme and it probably works much better for other viewers than it did for me. I respect the decision.I can unreservedly recommend this film - it complements the original novel and is superior to the remake I have seen. Herbert wrote a SF novel that morphs into a mystical epic, and the movie matches him almost move for move - not a literal reproduction of the novel but a masterful and ringing interpretation of it in cinematic language. Big win for the de Laurentiis family.I've noticed that there is pre-production work for a new remake of Dune slated for 2010.

Unfortunately, they don't do a good job of explaining the intricate political backstory of the movie. Another major problem is the pacing of the story, it's so too rushed. They made the mistake of trying to cram 2-3 movies worth of storytelling and lore into one 2 hours and 17 minutes movie. The production value (camera angles, special effects sets, costumes, etc.) is generally good for the time period. Some of the costumes are unintentionally comical and weird but that is what gives this movie its charm. Generally the acting wasn't great, besides the main protagonists. Over all it is an interesting tale that unfortunately fell short.",Dune

Perfect design and perfect music - perfect, perfect music - a film experience like taking a hallucinogenic drug!I did get the story, but that's not to the point! The film is hypnotic, dwelling, for instance, upon the relevance of embodiment. It is the old ""Man might be weak by nature compared with animals, but he can produce tools."" Tools no good! Be not have! Be not have! it echoes all way through. At some point it gets you. Should you use medicine or breeding schemes?Who knows? Who can tell?

No movie will ever live up to the original source material, simply because when a story is read, the images and context are subjective.That being said, this movie does a great job of capturing the setting of the book. The characters and their portrayals are also on point. It explains and captures the politics of the empire fairly accurately. The struggles and the palace intrigue are plain to see, as well as the cultural differences stemming from the different fiefs or planets. The stilsuits and worms are awesome!On the down side, the rest of the effects are cheesy and actually take away from the feeling created by the movie. The ornithopters, the terrible portrayal of the Sardaukar and the guild, his sister, the sonic weapons and the shields. Even the voiceovers, ships and city models are terrible. It takes serious material and makes it comical and almost campy at times (like Flash Gordon, but not in a good way!)This an example of trying to put too much into a movie and focusing on minutiae, which makes the movie listless at times.

228,sjwest,I Foresee A Lack Of Understanding'  Usal Muad'dib.,7,12 March 2004,"This is without doubt a more than ordinary science  fiction movie. The defining factors here are the complexity of the story and of the characters. Indeed as the Guild Navigator mind read the Emperor I see plans within plans'. On first viewing, one may be Lost In Translation'. There are a lot of reasons for this. The first, as previously indicated, is that the story is an involved one. The second is that in trying to adapt a story from an immense novel, editing may leave out aspects that will clarify certain points in the story. The last one belongs to the Director  David Lynch. One of the best he may be, but also one who likes to tease audiences with bizarre images. Dune' gave him ample opportunity to indulge. The fantasy aspect of the story meant that the character list was a tongue  twisting affair. We have among others, Reverend Mother Ramallo; Usal Muad'dib; Gurney Halleck; Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and Feyd  Rauta. Try saying that all in one go. But these complicating factors are also its endearing qualities, especially the mind  boggling story. Indeed it promotes its longevity. Although not a movie for everyone, fans will find themselves drawn into the web of deceit and the beautiful, cruel world of Dune'.There are a number of others aspects underlying the movies appeal other than its story. The grand sets, solid performances and special effects contribute greatly to the spellbinding affect. It is this combination of factors that, for me, make it stand out amongst the remake. I thought it superior to the mini  series in almost all departments. Even when taking into account the natural preference one may have for seeing Dune' before the series, I still stand steadfast by my opinion.As mentioned, the storyline is the factor that makes it the most unique sci  fi movie that I have seen. The hero's journey is a perilous one wrought with obstacles the likes of which have never been seen before. We have a psychic fraternity of women; a cruel and repulsive opposing family; a tangled web of deceit and, of course, the worms. Let's not forget the terrain that the worms inhabit. Not a drop of rain has fell on Arrakis. There are so many movies revolving around the unlikely hero who rises to become the one, the messiah. But as in The Matrix', this is not noticeable. The originality of the world that the characters inhabit and the events that pull them together in the quest for the power to control the universe, entices you in beyond the predictability giving you a thrilling journey.The sets are at times breathtaking. Not only do they appear realistic, even by today's standards, they also accentuate the nature of the characters. The opening scenes with the Guild Navigator and the Emperor show a set which displays an aura of power and wealth. A palace thus befitting a ruling monarch. The Guild Navigators craft and the holding tank for the 4th stage Navigator is indicative of the ominous and twisted beings that they are. The spice Melange has done them no favors' as far as appearance goes. House Harkonnen resides in a dark and foreboding place created to indulge their disgusting way of life (please note the drain). The craft they possess is of an imposing nature. Robust and crass thus mirroring their character. The set for the House Atreides creates a sense of opulence and taste. It is indicative of a noble family in the 18th century. The contrasting sets for the enemies distinguishes them into distinctly good and evil. A lot of hard work was put into the sets which paid off tremendously as the world of Dune' was bought to life for the big screen.The ensemble cast was superb and it was obvious that everyone was taking the movie seriously. Kyle Maclachlan was solid as Paul Atreides. Jurgen Prochnow as always plays the leader with his own cool quality. There is also a notable appearance by Sting who seemed to relish the opportunity at playing a bad guy. The star performance must undoubtedly go to Kenneth Macmillan who played the Baron giving us a reminder of a character we first encountered at school  Richard III. The audience can also sense the fun he has with the role which does not detract from the evil nature of the character. The audience would have believed that the Baron was a twisted man who wanted to destroy all that is beautiful since he was afflicted with a disgusting ailment. This portrayal was not achieved in the TV series which gave us a more unbalanced character on the side of comic relief. The movie gave us a Harkonnen which was a far darker breed thus posing a far greater obstacle to our heroes. Although we see more of the characters in the series, the image of the maimed and disgusting Harkonnen of the movie is the one that lingers.The special effects were noticeable by their weaknesses in a few scenes, but this is through the eyes of someone attuned to the special effects of today's movies. At times the characters seem to be copied and pasted onto scenes. The shields certainly looked fake. But on the whole they were still better than the series, especially the Worms who exuded a far greater power which was accentuated by the natural elements in the form of lightning. Indeed a memorable touch. The TV series was more elaborate but only succeeded in magnifying the fakeness.Another interesting point involves the use of voice  over as a method to give the audience a deeper sense of the story when we learn of characters inner thoughts. This adds to the surreal effect of the movie which may or may not have been intended. The initial intention was probably to try to tap into the multi - layered story that Dune' is and bring this translation to the big screen. I believe that it assisted the fantasy aspect of the story more than the insight that was intended. I have to agree with other users here that the ending does not do just to the slow, methodical build  up of the movie. It needs about 15  20 minutes extra to heighten the climatic scene and to not feel that we are being briskly guided to the exit door. However, there was a problem of choice since the movie would have been deemed to be too long. But the end choice did leave a gap creating a desire for another production which evolved into the TV series. Sci  fi has a mass appeal which rivals that of the action genre. We have a deep desire to explore the unknown and the advancement of technology does not satiate this, it exasperates it. Therefore the space travel and aliens has a certain resonance for us as the world becomes smaller and our natural boundaries are less inhibiting. It is so easy to learn about ourselves and the world around us, that we neglect this as we look further. The sci  fi movies address these fantasies and Dune' succeeds sublimely. It may not be the most popular, it may not be one of the best, but it is certainly one of the most sophisticated. If you are looking for a sci  fi movie outside the norm, Dune' should pose to be no disappointment.",Dune
229,Loveunderlaw,The best version of Dune ever made IMO!,10,3 June 2018,"Nothing post 1984 can even come close to being as good as this one, I like the fact F\X were used sparingly, & the actors were all top notch too.

230,Teach-7,Potentially good movie marred by poor editing,6,29 October 1998,"I saw this one when it was released, in  the huge, domed Colosseum cinema in Oslo. Being a regular customer, I noticed that nearly every movie shown there appeared to be very good, great or even a classic. It must have been the plush seats, the chandeliers, the palatial surroundings that did me in. Even ""Quest for fire"" thrilled me at the Colosseum...But ""Dune"", even here, was a turkey. A leaden script with no continuity, unannounced actors popping up all over the place, sodden special effects - you name it! And I had no knowledge whatsoever about David Lynch - he could have been anyone for all I cared.Fortunately the movie now seems much better! It started off our local Film Society season in September, and the crowd loved it. It's still hairy and risible in places, yes. But since David Lynch now is a household name, it's easier to appreciate it. ""Dune"" is at least recognizable as a typical Lynch-movie, full of bizarre visuals, kinky costumes and a fairy-tale plot. The last half-hour everything goes unhinged, of course, and dozens of pages of script is rushed through at near light-speed. The plot becomes almost impossible to follow. ""Dune"" at this stage, looks like a potentially great movie, partly ruined by senseless editing and hurried matte effects, especially in the guerrilla attack on the castle near the end. The warriors riding the sandworms look like dummies, and the background seldom jells with the action. Still, Kyle Mac Lachlan is very credible as the hero. And those supporting actors! Stewart, von Sydow,  Stockwell, Mangano, Sting....has there ever been a movie that could top that idiosyncratic list?",Dune

Its a total script writing cop out.
Given the cast is filled with great actors it's also odd how two dimensional most are.
I guess the book is fantastic, but that has not come through in the movie.
Some serious plot holes are the fact that the heroes army was wiped out by the baddies, but using the same ""weirding"" way of war he manages to win with an army he puts together by training a hundred who will train a thousand....

233,Skeptic459,The sleeper has awakened.,8,6 January 2004,"I don't really like science fiction. However, Dune is one of my favorite books ever. It has a depth to it that eludes most sci-fi. You notice in most stories of this genre there is very little spiritualism. David Lynch in his usual style goes after the more surreal elements of the book. This has got to be the only sci-fi story that has the characters taking hallucinogenic drugs to gain enlightenment. The film has a really cool psychedelic element to it. When Paul takes the spice melange and the sandworms look down upon him. Yeah man, pass me the bong!There are so many cool scenes in this film. When Paul has to put his hand in the 'Gom Jabbar.' I can't remember whether that is the correct way to spell it. When he ingests the spice melange. The final battle between the freeman army and the Emperors sadukar troops. Any scene with space navigators. His 'fear is the mind killer' mantra repeated as he rides his first worm. All of this is exciting and very cool. Lynch takes us into a completely alien world.The set designs are wicked. The whole film looks great. The space navigator guild looks like a bunch of s&m freaks. The bene gesserit look is also cool. I love how the space navigator creatures are worm/lobsters that live giant fish tanks.This film fascinated me as a little kid. I remember seeing it and much of it was lost on my little mind. My father being an avid fan encouraged me to read the book. I found my answers there. What makes me wonder is why don't people do the same? Nothing has to be handed to you on a platter. You do the math. Besides there is no way you can cover Dunes depth in the running time of the original film.Basically reading interviews with Lynch he states that he lost virtually all control of the project. That the studio began to make decisions for him on the picture. Lynch stated that the whole shoot was a nightmare and the film was just cut to pieces. He also had to keep the film reasonably mainstream. So basically you have a watered down Lynch version of Dune. But you also have an audience friendly version that is not friendly enough. So nobody ends up happy. The new extended version does not help things either. It adds a bunch of unnecessary footage and throws in a lame intro. Can you imagine if cult director, Alexander Jodorowsky of El Topo fame was hired to make this film? He was the original choice to direct. The film would have been amazing! What a shame!This film has some very visible flaws and is far from perfect. The Baron is overacted, although I did not really mind this. After all, he is the mean and maniacal villain. However, the actor I did mind was Sting. Besides from being a caricature he looks like a demented circus clown. He was obviously miscast. Patrick Stewart is another actor who is miscast. He does not play Gurney well and yells his lines Also Richard Jordon as Duncan Idaho was bad. I have always thought that this guy is a bad tv actor and I am glad we only see enough of him to be killed.However all the rest of the cast are dead on. From Dean Stockwell as the traitorous doctor to Duke Leto as the proud but doomed martyr figure. Kyle Maclachlan is also an excellent choice for Paul. He gives off a quiet, confident and regal air.Yes, some of the special effects are not very good. But this film was made in 1984 and is not going to look like the Matrix. The story is actually much, much deeper than the Matrix. Dune is also pretty slow by todays standards.But the film is tense and sometimes exciting. This is unlike the tv mini-series, which contains much more detail but manged to put me instantly to sleep. It was sooo boring. Not only that all of the acting sucked! Alec Newman can't act to save his life and has absolutely no charisma.
Lastly the music is very dated now. Brian Eno is a talented guy who deals in electronica but electronic music does date easily. Some of the guitar driven stuff like when Paul first rides the sandworm reduces the film to a kind of Flash Gordon camp.Overall Dune is a very mixed bag, it has many flaws but is still enjoyable. Not as hard to follow as some of the reviewers here would make out.  I think if you are a first time watcher this is the best choice. The mini-series is strictly for fans because the plot is sooo detailed that the casual observer will just lose interest. Plus this version has better acting, effects and is just much more fun. It has a deep and intangible mystery. An enigmatic air, which the mini-series sadly lacks.  But like anything if you want to understand the plot in its full entirety then read the book. Problem solved. I'll give it a 8 out of 10 because I am a fan that is not afraid of ambiguity.",Dune

237,blubb06,"Lively imagery, bad storytelling",6,29 June 2008,"I've just seen the 3 hour long Extended cut. It's still boring, but a stretch better than the incomprehensible theatrical version. It leaves much to be desired  above all, getting rid of the superfluous thought monologue voice-overs. Dune  a three hour opus told in whispers? Isn't film supposed to be a visual medium? They're particularly unnerving during the action-intensive second half. The music is mostly good and sometimes great, but fails to create suspense  lack of which is a feature of the whole. The special effects are still impressive, especially in the Giant sand worm scenes with lots of dust, but overall they could use digital retouching  the spice-blue eyes were obviously painted on, the blue-screen shots look mostly crappy, Paul's visions (which I imagine totally different, more like information overload)... Salvageable, but not yet there.It's a shame, really. On the up side: the sets, the aliens... the costumes are mostly fitting for the characters and hard to imagine any better (this goes for everything but flying machines, training devices and Atreides uniforms). I can only imagine what a more story- and action-oriented director would have achieved with this high quality of production design. The movie suffers from too many static scenes. They create a certain atmosphere, but also slow things down. The portrayal of Paul falls (un)dramatically short of the triumphant ending, which isn't entirely actor Kyle McLachlan's fault  he isn't the Luke Skywalker type, but never truly gets a chance to reveal himself. His visions are what defines him and makes him a demi god, but on film they're boring. The movie tries to make up for its slow pacing by cramming more unimportant details in than necessary, but doesn't reflect the hero's journey in an engaging way. Compared to colorful people like the Harkonnens, Gaius Helen Mohiam, Alia or even Jessica, Paul looks plain, dull and stiff. One could argue that the film's simple good-versus-evil or ""How-I-built-an-Empire"" story doesn't really do Frank Herbert's novel justice  like ""Lord of the Rings"" without Gollum  but I could live with the ending if the rest was more engaging. It has its moments, but they're countered by things that make me cringe  the Fremen, when they're not fighting, look more like a bunch of string puppets than a fierce army. The book also creates certain expectations for them to look oriental (I haven't noticed one prominent no-Caucasian in the entire cast). Stilgar is a sissy. Gurney and Duncan should have been merged into one character. Baron Harkonnen would have needed more brains to make a truly great villain and set him apart from his minions Feyd and Rabban. The climactic scene where Paul learns of the death of his father is totally mediocre. One keeps waiting for McLachlan's great performance that never comes. Everything... is... simply... too... slow.I much prefer the book in terms of entertainment value (seriously), but I would have missed something had I never seen this film.",Dune
238,jdavisjdavis,Loved it,10,3 November 2005,"Just plain loved it. It's one of those movies I never tire of... if it ever comes on TV i have to sit and watch it.I'm shocked and amazed that there are negative reviews of this film. So I'd like to point out some similarities and differences between it and the 2001 : A Space Odyssey reviews (which seem to be always favorable). I loved that one, too, by the way.Similarities: Striking visuals, lots of symbolism, lots of enigmas/lots unexplained.Differences: limited dialogue in 2001, pristine atmosphere in 2001 (aka clean and ultra simple, sometimes boring, visuals), covertly political and satirical, 2001 was also very simple in terms of technology and sci-fi. Dune was more obvious with the political dealings and had more ""magic"".So why does everybody like 2001 and only some like Dune? The same reason everybody likes Lord of the Rings as opposed to some other good fantasy movies. The Lord of the Rings was mythical, but had calmer and very played down ""magic"". This means the closed half of the human race that can't handle the ""magic"" side of things didn't put up a wall.Open up your wall when you watch a movie like Dune.

241,robert-300,What was Lynch thinking?,2,27 September 2003,"* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*  The year is  10191 and the known universe is reliant on the precious spice melange.It is this spice that makes it possible for the most powerful rulers and their people to fold space.That is to travel to any part of the galaxy in an instant.The spice however only exists on one planet in the cosmos.The desert planet of Arrakis which is other wise known as 'Dune'.The natives of the planet called the Fremen have long held a prophecy that one day a man from the outer world, a messiah will come to Arrakis and rid them of the rulers of the planet,the insidious inhabitants of House Harkonnen.For a long period of time a feud has raged between the head of house Harkonnen,the Baron Vladamier Harkonnen(Kenneth McMillan) and the head of House Atredies on the planet Caladan.The head of House Atredies is none other than Duke Leto(Jurgen Prochnow). The baron and his family are ordered by the emperor of the universe,Shaddam IV(Jose Ferrer) to leave Arrakis so that the Atredies may rule over the desert world and take control of spice production.Leto and his partner, the former Bene Gesserit witch Lady Jessica(Francesca Annis and they're teenage son Paul(Kyle Maclachlan) move to Arrakis,little knowing that the emperor's order is part of a vile plot between the emperor and the Harkonnen to wipe out the Atredies.For too long the feud between the Atredies and the Harkonnen a family's have held up spice production.When the Atredies are wiped out it will put an end to the feud and production may continue unhindered.Little do the emperor or the Harkonnen know is that Leto's son Paul is the messiah of the Fremen prophecy and that he will spell doom for the Harkonnen.Not only that but after his father's death he will vow revenge on the emperor and take his throne to become ruler of the universe. What was David Lynch thinking?That is quite clearly the first sentence that springs in to my head when I think of how much of an expensive,costly disaster his adaptation of Frank Herbert's epic novel was.With amazing sets and brilliantly designed planetary backgrounds to bring the story to life,Lynch to his merit had a an astonishing grip on how the universe from Frank Herbert's imagination should look.Not only that but the costumes adorned by the huge cast are a credit to the costume designers who created them and a testament to Lynch's visual genius.Other than the fact that most of the cast is of a high calibre this is an other wise embarassing attempt to bring the classic science fiction novel to the big screen. In trying to take Herbert's gargantuan epic story and condense it in to a movie with a running time of just over two hours,Lynch missed much of what was important in the movies plot.Great amounts of important issues that are raised in the book are erased from the movie completely and as such what we get is an unintelligible,confusing mess of a movie that makes little sense.We never fully under stand the politics of Arrakis and why the emperor takes the side of the brutal Harkonnen rather than the noble Atredies.Why in the end,Paul never has the emperor killed when he takes over Arrakis and the universe and how the likes of Paul's former tutor in the ways of combat Gurney Halleck(Patrick Stewart)survives the Harkonnen and Sardukaar onslaught of the Atredies. The performances as well like I have stated above are mostly good but there are exceptions.Most notably of course being Sting who is hopelessly miscast as Baron Harkonnens nephew Feyd-Rautha.He looks far too old in the role as he is supposed to be closer to Paul's age in the novel.As for his performance.The less said about that the better.I could commend the actors and go in to more depth at how they coped admirably with what is a terrible script.But what would be the point. In the end 'Dune' while visually impressive and admittedly decent enough direction from Lynch is possibly the worst movie of his career.It was a movie that should never have been attempted to be made.I hear there is a director's cut of the movie which is three hours in length.While longer I'm sure it will offer little in the way of coherence.Personally I would recommend that you read the book.That or watch the Sci-fi channels five hour mini-series version.Although not great it is certainly superior to this incoherent garbage.Robs Rating: *",Dune
242,cosmicfish14,A Bad Choice For Director,3,8 May 2015,"Dune is a very, very, VERY strange film. This was the first movie made by David Lynch that I have seen and that was probably a mistake because this movie is infamous for being one the worst book to movie adaptations ever. But for me, I have never read the book so this mainly on the film by itself. Also, if I ever read the book in the future I might do an Extra Thoughts post to see if anything changed.The first thing I need to point out is that in this movie, for some reason almost half of the dialogue is all inner monologue. Like when a character is speaking through their thoughts. And it isn't just one character, its like all of them, and it kinda feels pointless.Also there are a lot of pointless, or just confusing scenes. Like one scene has a bunch of the antagonists just doing strange and random things, and it has no point to the plot.Some of the special effects are also kinda outdated. Like a lot of them were very obvious green screen effects, but they still have nice designs though. It even has some early CGI in it.There were also a great number of cheesy or just unintentionally hilarious moments. I'm glad I got to see it in a theater for a David Lynch film fest, because the crowd experience made it even better. Some of the lines were so hilarious that I sometimes quote them today.""Where have my feelings gone?""- Paul Atreides Also the main character was really bland. Though apparently the actor for Paul ( Kyle MacLachlan), this was his first role in any type of movie, so for that I don't think he's that bad. Its just that his character is written horribly. His character is supposed to be like a savior for these people and all he does is kill people and make speeches. Also I laugh really hard when characters would mention all these weird science fiction type names then say "". and Paul.""But anyways, Dune was kind of a mess.

It is a great movie *based* on the book and has all the elements of a great Sci-Fi movie -- love, action, humor, otherworldly happenings, etc.I have a unique perspective on Dune because I saw this 1984 movie first, then I saw the 2000 mini-series second (see my separate comments on that one), and then I read the book -- last.  If I had read the book, I would have been a little disappointed by this 1984 movie, but seen and rated on its merits ALONE, it is a great movie.Even by today's standards, the effects in this movie are very, very good. By comparison, the mini-series looks like a video game -- good for a video game, but very poor for a movie.  The performances in this movie are top-notch and these things combined with plenty of excitement make this a movie that can easily be watched over and over again.I gave it a 10 out of 10 stars.",Dune
244,dracopticon,A Messiah-movie made by a God,10,29 December 2002,"Ok, ok. The summary line got a little out of hand there.
But seriously, this film is so good that it's very hard to cram all the good review points into one single (small) text like this. I have to admit, I thought this movie was totally incomprehensible when I saw it in the cinema for the first time back in the eighties.
And it can only be that - incomprehensible, if you've not read the book, because then it's doomed to be misunderstood in almost every part. I thought it was a big pretentious piece of boring crap the first time I saw it. And then, many years later I read the book by Frank Herbert and magically the pieces all fell into place. As they should.Then I watched the movie again and again over the years and it really saturated me with its mystical and strong-smelling scent of spice...All the actors, from Max von Sydow (so exceptionally good!) to Brad Dourif (excellent!) to Linda Hunt (truly magnificent!) to every other man and woman that made an impact through some real acting here, I say: tremendous good job!And, remember, this is before the computer-generated FX era. And yet, it kicks ass in revealing that overwhelming feeling you get nowadays in big buck movies like Lord of the Rings. And another link to the LoTR-production:
When I went to the movies to see this film during the eighties, you got a small brochure in your hand, telling you most informatively about how they made it. Apparently, the production of it overtook all the available space of every single work-room in Mexico City's Churubusco Studios. And the biggest of the sets had to be constructed outside the studios themselves. 75 different background sceneries was constructed in the eight work-rooms, which are one of the biggest ones in the world. Over a thousand people was working on the production set during its most hectic time. And another 20.000 extras was hired to appear in the movie. One other example is the fact that they made 24.000 stalagtites for a scenery, handmade prisms cut by skilled artisans. A good deal of the furniture was clad in Italian fine leather, specially flown in to the set.And all in all, 4.000 costumes were made. Nine seamstresses worked for four months, just putting together the magnificent mantle that Paul Atreides wears at the end of the movie.David Lynch, Oscar-nominated many times directed this film, and the Oscar-winning photographer Freddie Francis did the actual filming and footing of the movie. Architect and overall responsible for the unique design of the film was Anthony Masters, earlier Oscar-nominated for his work on the film ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"". And all the wonderful and strange appearances of the different kinds of people in the film, Carlo Rambaldi took care of. This is the man who earlier has been awarded three different Oscar-statuettes, among others for example the E.T.-creature. With a budget of 400 million dollars in the 1980s, this is a very well put together film.
I give it 11 out of 10.",Dune
245,ignatz928,"David Lynch's ""Dune""",5,7 September 2005,"When Dino de Laurentiis hired David Lynch in the early 1980s to adapt Frank Herbert's science-fiction opus Dune for the screen, he was no doubt hoping for something along the lines of the Star Wars movies, with great special effects and exciting action scenes. He must have been disappointed, since the final result, about 40$ million later, looks less like Star Wars than Zardoz, the incredibly strange John Boorman science fiction film. Neither movie is very good, but the experience of watching them is simply so utterly strange as to almost make up for their many failings. At least I could understand Dune somewhat better than Zardoz, as I have read the original Frank Herbert novel. Still, I can see how anyone who was not familiar with Lynch's source material would have been completely baffled by his adaptation, which is not very good. The core of Dune is a fairly simple adventure story about a prince whose clan is wiped out by their ancestral enemies, who he flees by going into exile among the Bedouin-like tribes of the desert planet that his father formerly ruled. They receive him as their Messiah, and he builds them up into an army to exact revenge on his enemies and overthrow the Galactic Emperor. But around this core, Herbert constructed an incredibly elaborate, complex portrait of an exotic far-future society closer to the Middle Ages or ancient Egypt than our own time, coated with multiple layers of political, religious, historical and religious allegory. I can understand why Ridley Scott, with his talent for creating almost obsessively detailed worlds, was also approached for Dune. The problem with adapting Dune is that these of the sort of details that work better on the page than the screen, where lengthy exposition is usually deadly and names like ""Shadout Mapes"" and ""Feyd-Rautha"" have to get past less than receptive audiences. Lynch's script strives to be as faithful to the book as possible, and the result is a film overstuffed with characters whose significance has vanished in the transition from page to screen, half-explained conspiracies and subplots, and dramatic events that are quickly rushed through. Lynch is obviously a very gifted filmmaker, but I don't think anyone would consider storytelling as one of his gifts- it's no coincidence that this, his most plot-oriented film, is also his biggest failure. Epics need storytellers like David Lean, directors who are willing to put style at the service of content, whereas Lynch's strongest work generally emphasizes the creation of a particular mood over story, which is either slim, as in Blue Velvet, or nonexistent, as in Eraserhead. In Dune Lynch's desperation to hold the monstrously complex plot together is such that he often resorts to explaining the characters' minds through clumsy voice-overs representing their inner thoughts. For De Laurentiis and Herbert, it must have seemed like an intriguing idea at the time to give the maker of Eraserhead a chance to make a film on an epic scale and budget, and at least visually the movie is impressive. There's always something interesting to look at on screen, though the production design is clumsy as often as it's brilliant. Take the execution of the ""stillsuits"" worn by the inhabitants of Dune, which function as portable plants for collecting bodily moisture and converting it into drinkable water. As shown in Dune, the suits include little nose pieces that give the unintended, unforgettably surreal impression that the characters are all wearing halved, Groucho Marx-like fake mustaches, a detail that might have seemed more at home in Twin Peaks. Lynch's talent for surreal, disturbing imagery really comes into play with the scenes involving the Space Guild Navigator, a huge talking worm floating in a tank, and the villainous Harkonnens, who live in a nightmarish industrial world shrouded in darkness and smoke. In other scenes, however, Lynch's propensity for dark cinematography is out of place, particularly when the action moves onto the deserts of Dune. The biggest problem with Dune is simply that it takes itself much too seriously. Herbert, as I said already, used a pulp science-fiction plot as the vehicle for all sorts of other preoccupations while still creating a fun adventure story, but the movie mostly just reflects Herbert's pretensions. It feels laborious, as if Lynch regarded the project as essentially a gigantic chore, and lacks of any of the book's sense of exhilaration. Lynch's direction only comes alive with the depraved villains on Planet Harkonnen. Earlier this year, I read a biography of Herbert written by his son that included a detailed account of his involvement with making Dune into a movie, and my impression was that he was too involved with trying to safeguard his work. The directors Scott and Alejandro Jodorowsky were dropped after Herbert realized that they would have made substantial changes to the book, and Lynch was brought on board to write an adaptation that would be as faithful as possible, but it's clear that what was needed was a hands-off attitude on the author's part that would have allowed the filmmakers freedom to make the necessary changes.",Dune
246,JackBenjamin,Collective Unconscious,8,8 August 2008,"I think Lynch is at his best when working with someone else's source material. Projects entirely his own are too muddled by the mess in his mind to translate coherently to the viewer.In this one I think he found a perfect complement: a strange, slanted world to which he could apply his dark palette, his slanted notion of reality.I haven't read the book which I think puts me at an advantage in commenting on the film. The elided plot doesn't bother me because I don't see it as central to the film's message -- the important thing is the creation of a world. And what a remarkable world! The stylistic mergers of epochs, the odd pathologies, savant-like talents, the strange expressions of motion -- most importantly though the creation of a single underlying consciousness. Almost every character who has lines of dialogue also has internal monologue. This is annoying at first, but turns out to be brilliant. First, it's the best way to convey Herbert's Jungian influence, which was significant; it reinforces the telepathic theme; and it effectively conveys an enclosed cosmology, a world that belongs not to us but to the characters on the screen.Gone are the days when studios grant license to mavericks like Lynch.",Dune

Lynch's dune (1984) is light years better then Dune from the year 2021 and still after so many years fascinates and captivates!Why?Because the story is intriguing, actors are superb, it's atmosperical dense and exciting till the end. Special effects, set design and costumes are absolutely outstanding.Villeneuve's Dune fails in every respect. Boring, misses the point, actors are partly miscast, VERY important details and background knowledge are left out and and again it's BORING!Well, Villeneuve's Blade Runner 2049 which had exactly the same problems should have been a warning signal for the producers.By the way: The rating for a huge amount of movies, specially blockbusters etc here at IMDB is massively corrected upwards by fake reviews and lots of 10 and 9.Villeneuve's Dune would be under 6.0 without the fake ratings, for sure!Mr. Lynch, i want to thank you for your visionary film!",Dune

I mean in today's world good visuals and CGI are a given and we get ""Lots"" of that in modern films but that said the story telling is just slipping below par, I guess with so many divisions in our societies ,different religions, sex's, opinions, views, perspectives, racism, ageism, discrimination, story's are now targeted at certain demographics making movies more appealing and unappealing in the same instance.",Dune

I thought it was needed so that I could better understand and appreciate Lynch's vision of what is considered a corner stone of sci-fi. I'm not going to lie and say that I loved the novel. I found it pompous and boring. Still I feel it would have deserved a better adaptation to the silver screen.Plot is incomprehensible mess, I have read the novel and I still was unable to concentrate to what was going on on the screen.Acting and casting were for the most part atrocious. People who shouldn't have gone anywhere near this project were dragged in and held at gunpoint until they agreed to utter their lines from que-cards. Or that's my impression based on how they were handling themselves in the final product.Special effects were quirky and outdated even to 80's standards, safe to say that they're obsolete today. Perhaps this one shouln't affect my judgement, but my first valiant effort in wading through this mess happened in year -89, and at that time I stopped watching purely for the sake of how this compared to movies I had previously seen by looks.Details, details, details... I wouldn't know where to begin. True to himself, Lynch cherry-picked the most revolting aspects of the original and exaggerated them beyond recognition, then made up some completely new ones and tried to squeeze them in with poor results.End result is a boring and confusing wreck of a movie which leaves a bad aftertaste and makes the viewer want a long, scalding-hot shower to get rid of the filthy feel it leaves on the skin.Not my cup of tea.",Dune

Perhaps that's the reason I approached it with an open mind and for all intents and purposes was blown away by its epic scale.Sure, once you've read the book the flaws become obvious, and some of the changes seem a bit odd (weirding modules anyone?). Still, I appreciate Lynch's uncompromising vision. Some might argue that putting his own stamp on one of the greatest sci fi books of all time was an insult. Still, the fact that there has not been a big budget remake since shows that it simply ain't that easy to recreate Dune on the big screen. Even the incessant inner monologues add to the eery atmosphere of this movie.To me this adaptation works fine on its own and is a triumph in sci fi film making. Those who want a more faithful adaption can look to the lower budget Sci Fi channel TV series from the year 2000. Let's hope that a big budget remake will finally get the green light and one day satisfy everyone's hopes. I won't be hold my breath though.",Dune

255,quantumcat,"Read the book first: Great movie, but objectively a movie with flaws ... major flaws",6,29 August 2008,"Dune is a success and failure in one. It fails to translate the book. It succeeds in bringing the world of Dune to life through wonderfully imaginative set designs, costume design and special effects and music (Toto!!!). The makers decided to cut away all background story and focus on the action. This is where all falls down. By cutting away that much, a fast paced action movie is created. Why ? Probably because at that time (the eighties) cinema movies seldomly reached past 120 minutes. In theory, a fast paced movie is a good thing. It won't bore your audience to death.,In case of Frank Herbert's Dune, you lose so much of the background story, you end up with a fast paced story nobody understand.Frank Herbert 's Dune was deemed unfilmable. I disagree. It is unfilmable in 90 to 120 minute film. Like Tolkiens LOTR. I think both books share something in common. Their world is so rich, not only in events but in information that these books have long been seen as unfilmable. I think Peter Jackson proved everybody wrong (though he made some dubious plot changes and decisions in the Two Towers). Books as these are so rich, you need to take as much time as you need to tell the story. Another example is Eragon. By trying to stay within the 100 minute limit, you get the book in fast-forward view!Back to Dune: I fell in love with this movie, because loved the acting, sets, costumes, general atmosphere. It is Dune come to life. And I read the book first. By having read the book first, I knew all there is to know. And the movie goes down easily. If you do not possess this knowledge, you end up distracted from the action because you have no clue what is going on and why. You watch 130 minutes of action and at the end a girl points at Paul Muad'Dib Atreides and shouts: ""he is the kwisatz haderach"" and you go... who? What? What is a kwasawhat?The SE DVD gives you a lot of extra informations and insights to dune universe politics, groups and people. These are accompanied with music and what looks like concept art. But it is vital information for those who have not read the book. I think this adds to the film, making it a richer experience. Similar like the added scenes in LOTR.I found both versions impressive and entertaining. Please note that the SFX are from the 80s and cannot be compared to nowadays CGI, although theses SFX are much better than most TV series CGI. CGI is the magic word nowadays, but CGI is only as good as the budget.For those unfamiliar with Dune, I recommend the SE, if you are prepared to invest 3 hours of your life. I think it's worth it.i",Dune
256,Oceans17,A beginning with Virginia Madsen can not fail,9,23 July 2007,"Lynch's creative imagination gives a film with a high rate of intense images per square inch of celluloid, beginning with two consecutive solemn scenes: a brief introduction with an impressive Virgina Madsen as Princess Irulan and narrator of what we are about to see, and the vision of a desert where the wind blows with an epic music.Intensity does not decay, as we found ourselves in an operatic exaggeratedly luxurious palace, the center of an already decadent empire, where very fine actors like José Ferrer and Siân Philips are dressed in spectacular dresses and matching wits with an octopus-like space- time navigator (and all that in less than a few minutes, compressing many pages of Frank Herbert's book).If that's not original enough for you, perhaps you should wait until a giant worm that causes mega-volts of static in the desert sand swallows a huge harvesting machine, or until you see a long row of men on the dunes waiting for an even greater worm and an aspiring messiah to confirm a prophecy in a mysterious death-defying ritual.If you think that stories are excuses to create powerful images, specially in a widescreen, that long row of men standing in the desert (while Paul walks towards his dangerous future) should not disappoint you, even if you are not a fan of Frank Herbert (I am not). As an image, it is one of the most powerful and cinematographically beautiful that I have seen. Lynch is to be credited for such a vision.Plus an endless list of top quality actors like Francesca Annis, Max Von Sydow, Linda Hunt or Dean Stockwell to name a few, wonderful characterizations (Jurgen Prochnow is just the right actor for Duke Leto Atreides, or Lynchian Everett McGill for Stilgar) and of course Kyle MacLachlan as the charismatic heir that becomes hard-boiled leader.9 out of 10 for a film with enough ideas and emotions to fill many films.

257,nscoby93,Too much source material to fit in a 2 hour film.,4,20 October 2021,"I knew when sitting down to watch this film in preparation for Dune 2021 I was going to be in for something rough, but damn was that rough.I notoriously struggle when going past the 90s to watch certain films, especially older films I've never seen before. While this film definitely has it's rough patches it also has, considering the time this film was made, some pretty damn good visuals. With some solid acting, and solid score this was at times a enjoyable, and watchable film. Yet I believe that is the most amount of praise I can give it.This film struggles greatly with what I will call the tell and don't show syndrome, literally the films entire opening is just a massive exposition dump. Perhaps because of the limitation of technology back in the day they couldn't do much, but I have seen older films do a much greater job at world building, and story telling than this film did in 2 hours. Then again that's what happens when you try to fit an entire 400 plus page book in a 2 hour film. Perhaps that is why they are wanting to do a sequel for Dune's 2021 remake, here's hoping it does good enough at the box office that the sequel will be made.Something else that is also very significant throughout this film was the pacing, it felt very odd. While at moments this film is willing to take it's time to build things up, in others it's also feeling very abrupt. Leaving me with thoughts of ""wait, what, how, what did I miss?"" It felt like I was taking a final exam on source material I never studied.While this film may have some impressive visuals for it's time, it lacks substance, and depth. For me personally the best thing to come out of this film was the chance to see a young Max von Sydow he was a great actor. Here's hoping Dune 2021 will make up significantly for the poor world building, and story telling.4/10.",Dune
258,sibelian,What a gloriously beautiful mess.,3,26 July 2008,"There are two films interwoven here, one is an uncompromising masterpiece and the other is a complete turkey.The first half of the movie is extraordinary. I was *floored* by the opening scenes, floored UTTERLY. They indicated an intricate, sober reality, stuffed with dreadful mysteries and frighteningly intelligent monsters. I love the secret Guild report. The low humming, the cold echoing, flat voice, the treatment of the Empire as a system to be manipulated, ""oooh,"" I thought, ""What's THIS?"" The approach of the Navigator, gliding in in his great, monstrous black box and his bizarre, stilted conversation with the Emperor resonated with me deeply, it spoke volumes about the nature of the world I was seeing, its age, its sophistication, its dangers and its habits of thought. It had the gorgeous alien-ness and magically imaginative richness of a high fantasy flick blended seamlessly with a solid, cold and ruthless universal paradigm. The emperor's palace was festooned with riches, but he had no choice but to receive the Navigator. He was not some mere despot or a benevolent father figure, but a politician. The Navigator was obviously phenomenally dangerous, but this wasn't communicated through meaningless threats but by how the reverend mother and the Emperor reacted to him and his towering, chillingly dark, hissing black box.I respect film-making of this quality, where alien worlds are brought to life with mere moments of dialogue and strokes of the visual designers brush. It's all about the mis-en-scene, guys. A picture truly is worth a thousand words. Star Wars did this also, brilliantly, in its opening scenes, but not as well as Dune, I think. I thought: ""Golly. I'm watching a grown up science fiction movie. Oh my GOD. I'm watching a GROWN UP science fiction MOVIE. They really did it."" And then it carried on like that for a bit. Geidi Prime was awesome, a hideous offense to nature, like a cross between an old hospital and an oil refinery. I'd never seen anything so ugly yet still underpinned by human tropes. Again, it spoke volumes about the inhabitants of the planet. And the baron himself was just so disgusting, so extremely evil that I was mesmerised by him and his relatives. The Beast Rabban was a bit rubbish, but I could believe in Sting's character, I think he pulled it off.Brad Dourif and his little litany still fascinates me. All the little litanies throughout the movie, these were lovely touches. I had no knowledge of the Dune Universe and these, again, brought the world to life, indicating a profoundly obsessive human society, guided by bizarre motives expressed in intensely focused, ritualised behaviours. It was freaky but *plausible* and in some ways terrifyingly familiar.There was one more moment of brilliance, the spacing guild taking the Atreides to Arrakis. The heighliner sequence was amazing in terms of visual design (although the effects were low quality even for the 80s), I was looking at an ANCIENT ship, utterly VAST and secretive and silent, like a gargantuan wreck at the bottom of the sea, a vessel that could easily be 4000 years old and could only come from an enormous intragalactial spacefaring empire, as I had been told of in the prologue. The docking port was half a kilometer high, framed with what looks solid gold and resembles the entrance to a leviathan's cathedral. Not been done again, that image. And instead of a space battle, we got a religious ceremony, potent and serious and filled with unclear but deeply felt meanings and stunning music. It was amazing. I'd never seen anything like it. I still love it. I'm one of those British people that Beecham said ""don't know much about music but love the sound it makes"", and I'm the same with movies. I don't mind if a movie scene doesn't make sense if I like the ""sound it makes"". It's probably silly to be so affected by images that are, in essence, so simple, but what is imagination for, then, hm?But... the Atreides.The Atreides turned up and the whole movie started to sag.Their dialogue was ponderous and dim-witted. They were slow and unconvincing, all of them. Jessica was totally silly, Kyle McLaughlan was appallingly miscast and the rest of Duke Leto's entourage were reminded me of nothing more than the Three Stooges. The only good bits were the fight between Gurney and Paul and between Paul and the robot and that's only because they had a cool idea about how to do forcefields and an interesting sound weapon. It was kind of cool to have a big, old-looking castle with lots of wood panelling many thousands of years in the future, in the 80s this idea was still new and fresh, but it wasn't enough to carry the Atreides as a narrative force just to have nice interior design.And don't get me started on the Fremen. They just didn't work. ""I will take the boy-man. UH!"" For pete's sake...It just descends into farce after they get to Arrakis. The film slowly but surely gets sillier and sillier until we reach the stupid climaxes of Paul riding the sandworm which had me covering my eyes and peering through my fingers at the appallingly bad acting and painfully bad dialogue. ""Long live the fighters. Long LIVE them. YEAH! GO FREMEN! WE'RE NUMBER ONE! Bro, I am so STOKED about this!"" It's AWFUL.Oh, and Alia. Nooooooooo, nononononononoNO. That was just wrong in every possible way, the way she talked was just sad. Alia's meant to be a kid that behaves like an adult, she's supposed to exhibit an unselfconscious absence of childishness that freaks people out and that kid playing Alia didn't do this.""Oh dear,"" I thought. ""They screwed this up very badly."" But it wasn't a total failure. I went and read the Dune series afterwards. So in the end the movie did serve *some* purpose....",Dune

Why then is it so criticised? Well, Dune fell prey to that most destructive of forces - the Hollywood editing process. The three years Lynch spent making this film produced enough content for a movie that would have been six (yes, six) hours long, which, of course, was unacceptable. To make the film more suitable for the mass audience the film was cut down to just over two hours and most of the remaining footage was destroyed. Arrrggghhh! Hence, the greatest sci-fi film ever made will never be seen and all we have left is an abridged version. Imagine the Star Wars trilogy cut down to a single two-hour film, or Gone with the Wind whittled down to 90 mins! Anyway, you see my point. The two faults of this film: the mangled ending and the oft disjointed plot duct-taped together with voice-overs were a result of the slash and burn policy this film suffered.

262,samuellickiss,"Poor, At Best",2,13 October 2010,"I should first of all point out that I saw this film only in October of 2010, so not exactly contemporary with its release. Being only 20 years old and perhaps used to flashy computer graphics I may approach Dune with some degree of bias. However, Metropolis is one of my favourite films so age doesn't have much bearing on me.As a big Frank Herbert (and Dune) fan I was really looking forward to seeing the film adaptation, fully expecting much of the book to be culled...but I spent much of the film confused. I really struggled to understand what was going on much of the time. There was no build up throughout the film, more just a series of events which merge into some gooey mess with lack of an understandable plot. I think Lynch has sort of missed a lot of the point of the book. Herbert makes a number of satirical comments in the novel and pungent points regarding human nature and society, which are completely missed. The Harkonnens irritated me particularly, not portrayed accurately at all.The score is mediocre. It had little substance, the main theme is pretty non-descript and throughout the rest of the film I had problems trying to work out much of a melody. The costumes saved it for me, I thought the costumes were spectacular and I really enjoyed the interpretations, particularly of the Reverend Mother. Bitterly disappointed and a waste of three hours of my life. I didn't worry about pausing the film to make a cup of tea (lots of cups of tea), there wasn't really much to miss.",Dune

I must confess I fell asleep the first time I saw it, but I saw enough to feel curious about this movie and saw it again. Some actors really fit the characters (Leto, Jessica, the Judge of Change - Max von Sydow -, even Paul Atreides). Others simply suck: Sting as Feith Rauta, the Beast Rabban, the Mentats...

267,Sperry23,Frank Herbert Approved of This?,2,15 August 2002,"While it had all the earmarks of a De Laurentiis film -- color, scope, and awe inspiring sfx, it lacked truth. It depended on gore and grue to portray the Harkonnens, rather than acting and subtlety. It depended on the art and beauty of the sets and sfx rather than on quality storytelling. I felt sad for the wonderful, quality actors in this piece. They had so much to give, and were so poorly utilized. Misrepresenting the ""weirding way"" as a technological thing rather than an internal discipline of combat was ridiculous, as was having it RAIN at the end of the film.Herbert was on-set for some of the shooting of this horribly mangled version of his exquisite book. It is said he approved all the changes to the story. If so, it is sad to see such a brilliant man in his dotage, mind and creativity gone.",Dune
268,happiscotsman,"""Tell them they're making the real Dune""",6,24 July 2003,"The above quote was from Frank Herbert in 1983 after he visited the ""Dune"" set. I can only imagine what he saw that would move him to make such a proclamation. My own personal take on this filmed version of Herbert's sci-fi masterpiece is that it in many ways it was a valiant effort, but there is too much left unexplained to the novice part of the audience which would probably account for more than seventy percent. I say that because the movie's trailer markets Dune as a quasi-Star Wars escapist flick. While there are certain elements of that in the book, Dune is not supposed to be all action. The suspense thrills come more internally from the characters rather than externally, which makes it very difficult for any director to project into a visual medium. Lynch gives it his best shot, but I don't think he should have been the choice for this one. He is a stylist filmmaker, and seemed to pay too much attention on the Harkkonens and not enough on other areas like the Spacing Guild and the Bene Gesserit. So why should anybody see this? I see the movie as having two redeeming features: the cast and the soundtrack. The music is unearthly enough to give the impression of an alien world (bravo Brian Eco and Toto!), and Jurgen Prochnow is exactly how I imagine the Red Duke. I do think that Patrick Stewart and Freddie Jones would have done better to have switched roles, and Everert McGil is a little too stiff for Stilgar. But Kyle Maclachlen does just fine as Paul, Sian Phillips is also good as the Reverend Mother Ramallo, and even Sting shows the right blend of aloofness and barbarity for Feyd-Rautha. ""Failed masterpiece"" is how I would sum up this effort, and even so it does a better job in 2 1/2 hours than John Harrison could do in six. Give it a try, but NOT until you've read the book!",Dune

Consequently, this, plus the fact that I'd never read any of the Dune books at that point, meant that I found Lynch's vision peculiar in the extreme. BUT, I also found it strangely fascinating.... so much so, that I got a friend of mine to watch it with me, so I could ""show him how weird it was"". But again I found it strangely fascinating, and I found myself being drawn into this incredibly and unique world that Lynch (and obviously Frank Herbert) had created.Fast forward 25 years, and after numerous viewings, this is one of my all time favourite films. I've also since read all of Herbert's Dune books (Dune itself a number of times), and I'm only too well aware that Lynch's film isn't exactly 100% accurate to the book (Hell, in some places it's not even 1% accurate!), but that isn't a problem for me, as the FEEL of the film captures Dune absolutely perfectly for me. It's weird, it's beautiful, it's haunting and it's TOTALLY unique, and for that this movie stands alone and ranks as one of my favourite films of all time. (The truly daft ending with rain falling on Dune that would kill all the Sandworms and therefore end the production of the Spice, is the only thing that stops me giving this movie a 10 out of 10)As an aside, I would dearly love a studio to buy up the rights to this movie, fully remaster it, add in a number of the excellent scenes from the terribly ""voiced-over"" extended TV version, plus perhaps shoot some new scenes to supplement it, and sympathetic re-do a few of the less successful original SFX scenes with some subtle CGI.

I recommend to people who wants to watch this; go make a little research on net about the main aspects of the novel and etc.This was a good science fiction movie. For it's time; visual effects was really good also costumes were well-designed. There were lot of famous actors and actresses in the movie. These are all plus. Because of adapted from a good novel, of course the story was very very good.Finally if you like David lynch movies (dreams, creatures, mystery) and science fiction you will also like this movie.

I got as far as the part where Paul puts his hand in the ""pain box"" and then got bored and put it away ( I think the paperback is still somewhere in my attic ). Frankly, the novel seem to me like a cross between ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Stranger in a Strange Land"". Too plodding, too religious, too political - not Science Fiction material at all. Give me ""The Lensman"" series by E.E. ""Doc"" Smith or Asimov's ""Foundation"" trilogy for world-shaking epic story-telling. ""Dune"" did not cut it with me.However, when I saw David Lynch's vision of the novel I was quite intrigued - not with the story, messianic story lines don't intrigue me, my opinion of the novel is unchanged - but the quirky visualization really seemed to project the correct atmosphere for a future human civilization. Something that's usually missing from Hollywood space operas. If you could somehow splice the visual richness of Lynch's ""Dune"" with the characters and storyline of Goddard's ""Alphaville"" I think you would have one helluva good movie. I'm sure Eddie Constantine could handle a ""weirding module"" with the best of them.",Dune

Where's DUNE 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?",6,14 July 1999,"Terrible special effects, incomprehensible dialogue and textbook wooden acting -and it's still great!In college my wife worked at a Suncoast Movie Co. in Seattle, and she said it was probably the biggest mover of all the pre-1990 films.  This infamous flop has some magical attraction to it that continues to draw viewers, despite dire warnings from stodgy acquaintances.  That attraction is the indelible mark of Lynch, whose mark has never failed him, even in his lesser work - with the exception of the unspeakably bad Twin Peaks movie (and what a let-down that was).Not many people seem to know that after the success of Lynch's ""The Elephant Man,"" George Lucas offered him the chance to direct a movie called ""Revenge of the Jedi,"" but Lynch didn't take it.  In some other plane, the world is a much different place, with Lynch's name and very subdued mark on ""Return of the Jedi.""  I believe Lynch turned the offer down because he knew he would be on a tight leash, whereas good old Dino and his Mexican stages would leave his hands untied (until the money started running out - those process shots!).*There are so many campy things in this movie, that even for first-timers to Herbert or Lynch, or non-believers in the whole genre of sci-fi, that it's still fun to watch despite its crippled, top-heavy nature (unlike ""TP: Fire Walk with Me"").  McLachlan's hair helmet, Sting's one-note performance (I think he has only one line, which he merely emotes a little differently each time: ""I WILL kill him,"" ""I will KILL him,"" etc.), and the poor decision (probably made by Lynch at wit's end) to have many characters spell out the gears of the plot with dubbed thoughts (and it's still hard to follow to those who haven't turned the pages).  I think the opening 15 minutes is by far the best section of the movie, but others swear the entire film ""RULES."" Great sets, great costumes, and look for Lynch himself as a spice harvester... ""But, sire, THE SPICE!""My opinion on the series is that it gets progressively more lame with each book.  I've read the first one twice, and once anxiously dove into the series.  The second book is good.  Then, Herbert seems to have taken a cue from Dickens and written the rest to pay the rent.* Duwayne Dunham, one of Lynch's editors (""Blue Velvet,"" the Twin Peaks pilot), did end up cutting ROTJ.

I don't know who thought that David Lynch was the right person to write and direct this story. Dune isn't a surreal story. It's a pretty straightforward, albeit elaborate space opera.The acting was terrible. It's like watching elementary school kids doing Shakespeare. Poorly. Not a single player in the movie turns in a good performance. But then how could they, what with the screenplay being such a mess? Having said that, there are a few areas in which Dune succeeds. Namely, the costumes and the sets. They got the look of this universe down.

It felt like a mix of Star Wars, BeetleJuice in a way and Blade runner. Based on the book by Frank Herbert, The story is focused on A very important item that controls the universe , folding universe travelin without moving and other things mentioned in the beginning just like star wars - and there are four families who want it . I even saw the guy who does the voice of CHUCKY! Brad dourif, with Sir Patrick Stewart, Virginia Madsen, Sean Young, the captain ! From ""how I met your mother "" all the amazing actors back in the 80s . The score was pretty good especially the final one. There was also a character that reminded of Catra from She-Ra and she was just a kid. A very Bizaare movie honestly and I liked it in a way and disliked it another.

278,Cristiano-A,"Twenty years after, see it again!",8,28 February 2007,"DUNE is a sci-fi movie, directed by David Lynch in 1984, based on the novel by Frank Herbert, published in 1965. The novel is considered as one of the greatest works of science fiction of all times. The story happens on a distant future, in a feudal intergalactic empire, where the planetary feuds are controlled by noble houses who owe obedience to the Emperor. The hero of the film is the young Paul Atreides, heir of the Ducado Atreides, responsible for the exploitation of the spice melange, in the planet Arrakis. In a story that explores the complex interactions between politics, religion, ecology and technology, the fate of Paul, its family, of Arrakis and its native inhabitants, as well as the fate of Emperor Padishah, of the powerful Space Corporation and of the mysterious female order of the Bene Gesserit, all finish linked in a confrontation that will change the course of the humanity. Frank Herbert made a great innovation in DUNE, upon using psychological, religious, philosophical and ecological elements, that were up to that time rarely used in science fiction. One of the most interesting characteristics of DUNE is the feudal atmosphere. The noble houses rule the stellar systems, its feuds. There are no robots or computers. All technology is analogical or biological. It has thus a valuation of the human figure and of the political and social intrigues. The film includes Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides and a series of well known European and American actors in the supporting roles, like Francesca Annis, Sting, Jose Ferrer, Virginia Madsen, Pretty Hunt, Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow and Jürgen Prochnow. David Lynch was chosen by producer Raffaella di Laurentiis, after she had seen The Elephant Man. At that time, Lynch was receiving several invitations, including oner for directing The Return of the Jedi. The filmings began in 1983 with a budget of more than 40 millions dollars. The first version had more than 4 hours and the final version approved by Lynch lasted around 3 hours. But Universal Pictures wanted a cut only two hours long, that could be more apellative to the public. Thus, the producers Dino di Laurentiis and Raffaella di Laurentiis and the director David Lynch had to remove several scenes and simplify sequences. The film premiered in the 3rd of December of 1984 and the expectations were great. In the first place, it was the adaptation for cinema of one of the most popular novels of science fiction. On the other hand, the director David Lynch, had several successes, as Eraserhead or The Elephant Man. The movie was was not well received by the critic and by the public, generating an income well below what was expected. Even David Lynch, in a certain way, denied the film, saying that the final cut was not of his responsibility and that the producers restrained him from having the artistic control of the production. He said: ""I began selling me with DUNE. Looking backwards, I should admit that the fault was mine. Probably, I never should have done this film, but I saw so much possibilities. I could create an entire world. But I received immense indications from Raffaella and Dino di Laurentiis about what kind of film they expected and I could not make the final cut"". The movie only obtained 27 millions of dollars in the box office. Given the total costs of 42 millions, it was considered as a finantial flop. As a result of the commercial failure and of the bad reviews, the foreseen sequels were cancelled. The critic was very hard with the film. For example, Roger Ebert wrote ""This movie is a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time"". And added that it was the worst film of the year However, with the elapse of the time, the film has been looked in another way, becoming a cult film and being praised by many new critics.

The story is obviously very complex, perhaps to complex to tell in a 2 hour movie but the director does his best and on the whole makes a very good film adaption.The cast is outstanding and watching the manifestation of Paul from wet behind the ears Duke's son to the leader of a vast and destructive army is very compelling. Also when you consider this film was made back in the 80's the special effects are very good with only the fighting shields looking dated. On the whole I felt this was an excellent film, now I all I need to do is go back and read the book to see how close to the spirit it came to the original work, pretty close I feel.

280,Spider-52,Should only be used as a companion to the novel.,8,8 September 1999,"David Lynch's ""Dune"" is a mixed bag--at times it is a breathtaking film, and at others it is a frustrating one.The best thing this movie has going for it is, by far, its visual style. Contrary to what many believe, I think David Lynch was an excellent choice to adapt ""Dune"", even though he goes a little overboard with his portrayal of the Harkonnens (what's with the ""heart plugs""?).  The visuals are richly textured and match the feel of Herbert's novel, although they make the movie noticeably darker in tone than the book.It must be said that David Lynch's film should not be viewed by anyone who has not read Frank Herbert's novel.  These individuals will be completely lost as to the direction of the story and the meaning of many scenes, and will most likely end up frustrated at what a mess this film is.  Watching ""Dune"", one gets the feeling that it would have been more suited to a long television mini-series than for a feature length film.  Far too much of the last half was cut out, and it seems to rush along without bothering to stop and explain anything to anyone.However, for those who have read the novel, the film version of ""Dune"" is an excellent companion piece.  For these people, the gaping holes in the plot can be filled in by the details from the novel.  Although the casting is universally bad, some of Lynch's personal touches are awful (the blob-like creature from the Guild), and it had too much to say in too little time, the effort and visual genius is too great to be ignored.

I anticipated a fun movie, but I am not sure I can even say this is good camp.

284,Col-3,"Exposition, Exposition, Exposition!",3,27 July 2000,"I'm a fan of the book, of course. Dune was a great book, top-notch science fiction with a few fantasy elements thrown in for good measure. It's rich, intricate, and involving. Everything a good book should be.This movie, on the other hand, is the epitome of bad cinema. I'm stunned at the amount of praise this movie has received from my fellow reviewers. It's long, dull, and utterly mystifying. An unbelievably large amount of screen time is given to characters thinking explanations of what is going on. Oh god, the whispering voices, expositing on each scene! It's a nightmare, an interminable nightmare. The script is dreadful and lifeless; I cannot think of one single real conversation. Not one! Most scenes involve ""profound"" phrases from one character, usually involving a context-less piece of jargon, then the rest of the characters in the scene all stare off into space and think about what was said. There are many times in the movie, where literally 5 or 5 scenes will go by without spoken dialog, all the talking occurring as voice-overs. The actors have no choice, I suppose, but to be wooden and overly dramatic. It's the script I blame. The only reason the Atreides are likeable at all is because the Baron is a pus-oozing, baby-eating monster. In comparison to any real, human character, Kyle MacLachlan's Paul Atreides seems, at best, a melodramatic bore. At worst, a fanatical robot.The way the movie is shot and edited - especially the battle scenes - somehow removes any excitement from them. Battles are mostly disjointed shots of people falling over in sand. The special effects are very primitive; any time there's interaction between actors and some kind of SFX, you can practically see the blue screen, since the actors will be one color and the background a different tone entirely. The spaceships look rather ridiculous. And what the hell is a ""weirding module""? Some costumes are not bad, but many are ridiculous, like the Harkonnen and Sardaukar body-condom suits. Hah! They look like sewer workers, not the galaxy's most feared shock troops.All in all, this movie is only fit for a thorough lashing by the robots of MST3K. We found a way to mitigate the boredom; whisper what the characters are *really* thinking. Only by making Paul think ""My butt is itchy"" could we sit through this disaster.",Dune

Thus Lynch managed to get a lot of bad press about this near masterpiece.It is very difficult to fit the plot of Herbert's masterpiece into 130 minutes, but I think Lynch did a good job, sadly he added som stuff that was not in the book. Where Lynch does excel is in setting the mood. To help him he had probably the best possible cast for such a movie and the best musical score ever. The acting overall is excellent (except possibly Maclachlan and Jones) and for me who read the book before seeing the film, it is hard not to see Stewart as Halleck. The timing of the acting and events is almost perfect. If Lynch had had help by a better scriptwriter to curb some of his wilder additions and flesh out the plot a bit and this could have been one of the best sci-fi movies ever. As is, it is very good, but somewhat flawed.",Dune

I also remember it being painful to sit through in the theater. It is impossible to shove a huge, several-hundred-page book into 2 hours. The amount of material cut to make it fit simply negated any sense of complexity or wonder in the original novel, and in some places strained the bounds of logic.Every single character (except Baron Harkonnen, who shrieks loudly) whispers throughout the entirety of the film. It's as though the director had been told that whispering increases dramatic tension, and thought that if a little was good, then a LOT....or, perhaps, they just didn't want to wake the audience.If you're a fan of the books....avoid. It'll just make you irritable.",Dune

289,ericjcant-1,The triumphs are larger than the failings of Lynch's Dune,6,19 April 2021,"Lynch's Dune is a genuinely complex film to review, not because of the Dune story, but as to why there is such a dramatic gap between moments of incredible excellence and equally clear failures.I think from the outset Dune was put forward with the misguided expectation that because it takes place in ""space"" it should be a blockbuster, which then means it should have a certain framework reminiscent of Lucas or Spielberg as the ideal hit makers of the time. Creatively speaking, this type of thinking should never have entered this movie. Lynch himself seems to have tried to conform to a semblance of a Hollywood blockbuster, and then topping things off with his creative touches, but the result is that the movie is a conflict of creative interests. The most effective and evocative scenes in this movie are when its' interests are not trying to spoon feed you information. Dune as a watching experience, should probably be left vague, and probably without narrative explanation altogether. As a film I think Dune needs to be allowed to not have to explain itself, and explanations should probably be sparse or even cryptic, because tonally Dune is a mysterious book, and though it has moments of world building and info (being a book), it is more the positions, loyalties and character traits and dynamics in the face of epic transitions of power and history that evoke the most significance.There are many scenes and moments in Lynch's Dune that achieve some unique atmosphere, and with superb acting. Jurgen Prochnow, Francesca Annis, and Kenneth McMillan played the most competent and interesting roles for me. Kyle MacLachlan does a wonderful job, but he is slightly too old for the role. Consider the scene where Duke Leto and Paul are talking under the moon of the night sky of Caladan. Powerful scene, but the prophetic impact would have felt so much more significant and intensely weighted if McLachlan had instead been a more appropriately aged actor for the role, such as maybe River Phoenix. But age discrepancies aside, Kyle's acting is appropriately fitted to the character, just not his slightly too adult appearance by this time.I don't want to go too far into Dune's failings, but there are plenty, and it starts immediately with the opening narrative trying to establish a verbal context for a very complex and highly advanced foreign universe. Not usually a good way to introduce a movie. ""Show, don't tell"" which is actually what Lynch is usually best at. So this results in a movie that too often tries to serve requirements that detract from aspects that are interesting and experimental.",Dune

The first time you see the film, it's probably a little too much to take in and understand. But watching it as an adult, I like it even more. This is David Lynches almost near masterpiece. The sets are colorful. The pacing is quick & the atmosphere very dark. It is a weird, disgusting and so much different than any other sci fi of it's time. A lot of good, familiar actors. Kenneth McMillan - an odd But good casting - as the floating fat man villain with gay tendencies is in his complete glory here.

Thankfully, Lynch delivered a concise experience that manages to be fantastic all the way through.One of the only criticisms I would point out is the 1st-ish act, where you don't really know who anyone is and nothing is explained to you (other than some starting narration), but that quickly fades, becoming a sci-fi classic with some great visuals that still hold up, an interesting plot and well written characters.B+",Dune

Bakshi failed, and so did DeLaurentiis. But not completely. ""DUNE"" was state-of-the-art, it has it's very own, unique impact and delivers plenty of the most memorable and captivating scenes ever brought to screen. I like this movie very very much. As i mentioned already, it's impressive, captivating and just good entertainment, to say the least. My hope for DUNE: a remake in the caliber of Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"". A trilogy maybe? Anyway, as long as nobody comes up with it, i watch ""DUNE"" every once in a while. And hey, it's a David Lynch movie!",Dune
293,marynystrom,Overall good,8,6 December 2018,"I've honestly never seen anything like this film. Which was refreshing, considering most movies you see now days are pretty similar to something else you've seen.The movie boasts an all star cast which is completely true. With every new scene I was seeing a bunch of familiar faces. Kyle Maclachlan, Patrick Stewart, and Sting to name a few. I was born in the late 90s so I'm sure there are plenty of 80s movie stars that I wasn't recognizing.The acting was typical 80s Sci-fi acting. So a little bit cheesy, but I'm one who enjoys that type of thing every now and again.The soundtrack was really good. I love the 80s music.There were lots of weird gross things that sends chills up your spine. Plenty of the unordinary. Concepts you've never thought of. Something completely new to watch.The only part I have to complain about is Stings character. It didn't really make sense how they included him. They have this guy that they kind of hype up as this mysterious bad guy that will be unleashed as this weapon, but nothing like that happens and you were kind of wondering why he was even included at all. Either not have him in it or don't waste his character and have him a bit more included and have a bit more of a purpose to the film. Basically if they had taken him out of the movie there would be no gaps to fill at all.",Dune
294,oscarpayne-99114,"Some things to love, but oh so many to loathe.",4,13 August 2020,"I read the 1965 novel recently in preparation for Villeneuve's star-studded effort out of sheer excitement and admiration. I found a copy of this floating around, so I gave it a go.
My expectations were in check when my father walked in and sighed.
Firstly: practical effects, costumes, performances - all great. The Baron in particular is suitable evil and Gurney Halleck is a standout.
Things don't land though. While those aspects are good, the changes from the source material are mind-bogglingly stupid. The weirding way of Bene Gesserit combat turned into a weapon called the weirding module? No. The character of Alia was executed painfully. Some sequences were unintentionally hilarious. But the most egregious of all are the internal dialogues. Thoughts and feelings told in exposition placed over the scene. It's dull. Show, don't tell. The music is also strange. Good, but strange. It doesn't fit the film at all. Who on earth thought Toto would be a good fit? Granted, the main theme is fantastic.
Overall, Denis Villeneuve has a lot on his plate to fix before his rendition. Take this as a warning of what not to do when adapting a book.",Dune
295,wolf-53,Sloppy,3,16 April 1999,"This movie actually had a little bit of potential.  There were some aspects of the story that were somewhat interesting, but all in all this movie is horrible.The movie is rushed, and if you lose your attention for a split second, you're lost for the whole movie.  The characters, although well acted, have an awful script to work with and almost no character development.  Many key scenes make no sense, which hurts the movie greatly.  The narrator helped to understand the story, but each character's inner monologue was extremely annoying to watch.This movie is cheesy, and horribly written and edited.  It's too bad, because it had a little potential.   3/10",Dune
296,Klaus Silberbauer,Disappointment,3,18 May 1999,"After having read the novel, I was thrilled to learn that Dune had been made into a movie. Too bad the movie was such a bummer. Herbert's fabulous novel is just not right for David Lynch's introverted way of film making. I've found out that before Lynch decided to make his grandiose disaster, Jodorowsky, Moebius and Chris Foss was underway with a beautiful concept of Dune. Unfortunately they didn't make it and we were left with Lynch's mainstream weirdness. Lynch's Dune is not a venture into the future and into another world, as it is a venture into Lynch's ego. Eraserhead, Wild at Heart, Twin Peaks: that's Lynch. Dune: that really should've been someone else.",Dune
297,avezou1,The beginning of the end for sci-fi movies,3,3 January 2002,"I have two things to say about this movie, first about Lynch's adaptation of the book and about the film itself.I am among those who read the book entirely. ""Dune"", by F. Herbert, is a very original sci-fi novel, though not the masterpiece some people claim it is, because it's too obviously a masterpiece. It is good fantasy, with some sort of new-age message. Its main asset is that it emphasizes on ethnological and character study. In the book, THE STORY HAS NO REAL IMPORTANCE. F. Herbert wrote action scenes only when he couldn't avoid to.The film is diametrically the opposite. When a character appears, the viewer has five seconds to guess his feelings, motivations, strengths and weaknesses. Then he disappears and re-appears one hour later. Did D. Lynch and I read the same book? I seriously wonder. If we did, why does the movie disowns so abruptly the spirit of the novel? If Lynch wanted to shoot his own sci-fi action movie (why not?), why did he choose to adapt ""Dune""? There are hundreds of sci-fi novels which would make fine sci-fi movies.The movie in itself is kitsch and has no point. It fails in recreating the virtuosity and positivity of ""Star wars"" (which is one of its ambitions yet) and the humanist dimension of ""Blade Runner"". It is an overlong MTV video-clip which foreshadows 1990s' sci-fi movies. The age of dummies started with ""Dune"", which is a shame considering who directed it.
A good movie to watch with a beer and a burger. A bad movie otherwise.",Dune
298,socialconscience,Reallly hoping the remake doesnt fall flat on its face,10,9 September 2019,"David Lynch said that making Dune was one of the most painful experiences of his life.Yes, the directors cut was terrible.The first mini series was even worse.But in spite of Lynch's (or perhaps because of) this 1984 Dune version will always remain the best for several reasons. Yes, I know I speak before the water is boiled (upcoming Villenueve Dune). Why I think Lynch's version is the best-having read all Dune novels:Almost all of the characters are spot-on as you would think of them in the books. Especially the baron played by Kenneth M. Honestly, it will be nearly impossible to live up to such an illustrious ensemble of actors, special effects wizards, etc. Mentats are perfect although Freddie Jones could have been replaced. Paul Smith was perfect as the Beast. Jason has his work cut out for him as he has a look of intelligence and the Beast as portrayed in the books is very stupid and easily manipulated by the Baron. Sting was pretty awesome as Feyd in spite of what others may say. He portrayed the character quite well. Jurgen Prochnow was a perfect Leto but lacked the script for good character development. Kyle McLaughlin was a bit too old but he did an amazing job as Paul. Everett Gill was also as I imagined that Stilgar looked like and behaved. Max Von Sydow is amazing in everything he does and his version of Kynes was spectacular. Jose Ferrer was a good actor but he too lacked the script for good character development. This films flaws can easily be overlooked due to it's amazing delivery of an immense narrative that any Dune reader can attest to.The still suits in this film are absolutely perfect. This should be exactly the same in the upcoming film. It is exactly how it is described in the books.No contest on the Sardukar though, the new movie can easily make them look much more badass than the hazmat suits in the original.Some say that the Blade Runner remake was good, if not great. As someone who watched the original in 1986 and have rewatched it countless times since, I found the remake to be a good film but not a Great Film. I could take it or leave it. It didnt make me think. It didnt inspire me to re evaluate any eschatological or existential questions as the Ridley Scott version did. I'm hoping the new director of Dune will try to capture the heart of the story as well as Lynch did even though he never truly got to finish the film.",Dune
299,mjs2342,One of the best Sci-Fi movies,6,6 January 2000,"Yes, I know, its a little provocative, but the movie has a consistent design throughout the story. And the actors are great.

Just go into this with a completely open mind about science-fiction and you will not be disappointed.If you're going to see one 1984 science fiction film BESIDES 1984 itself which is also a great movie, see this one.

Every time I see it, I have to remind myself that it is not a work of David Lynch alone. Still it hurts to see what a mess they made of the combined talents of David Lynch and Frank Herbert. The best thing about the film is that Lynch introduces us to his star to be Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atrides. If you are a Lynch fanatic it is a must. If you are a Herbert fanatic it is painful. And you just enjoy a good film every now and then, it is a waste of time. Go for Blue Velvet or 2001: A Space Odyssey depending on the reason for considering this film.",Dune

I am a pretty intelligent guy. I am well read in both the classics and contemporary literature, although I had not read the Frank Herbert book. I enjoy science fiction. For the life of me, I had no idea what was going on. I couldn't keep the characters straight, who was in league with who, who had a plot against who. It was just a stew of confusion. I turned it off after an hour or so; I simply lost interest, having no bloody idea what everyone was talking about.I know Lynch has the distinction of making films that some people have a hard time getting a handle on. However, this movie doesn't have the visual beauty and evocative mood of Lynch's best work. I mean, not only is the plot indecipherable, in spite of voice overs that seem to go on forever, the costumes and special effects resemble a high school production of Star Wars. I haven't seen a movie I enjoyed less since trying to sit through Jason and the Argonauts. Blech!",Dune

It has variable special effects which can range from dated and clumsy (some of the flying vehicles) to fantastic (The awesome Sandworms).It also has possibly (in the style of David Lynch) one of the most repulsive villains ever, the Baron Harkonnen.The best way to treat this film would be like Eraserhead. Eraserhead can't be viewed or judged in the same mindset as most other films. The same should apply for Dune, it should not be compared to films like Star Wars. Probably more like 2001.One more thing - Frank Herbert, the author of Dune, actually said he liked David Lynch's version.",Dune
307,mercuryix-1,The Best Bad Movie to Forget About,2,16 January 2008,"If there is one major movie that can be lost and forgotten about, without a loss to cinema, it is Dune. This was an enormously expensive movie to make, and it looks it; it takes a lot of money to film something that visually looks this drab, this depressing, and this off-putting. I didn't know that David Lynch both directed and wrote this movie until years later, but when I did, everything made perfect sense. The author of the book chose the Wrong person to do a screenplay of it! Lynch wrote the movie not caring if it was coherent or made sense to the audience. He directed all of the scenes to be bizarre for the sake of bizarre, and off-putting for the sake of itself. In short, he directed it for himself, not caring what the audience would think. This works if the director of a film is realizing his vision and his vision happens to be accessible to the public, but Lynch's vision and mentality are anything but that. There are artists that paint for themselves, and have contempt for what viewers think. I don't respect these people, because they're not artists; the definition of art is that it communicates, to a purpose. Art is by definition a form of communication. Here, Lynch does not communicate, nor cares to. The result is incoherent, off-putting, repellent, and contemptuous of its audience; in other words, the film is pure Lynch.If you happen to have Lynch's peculiar mentality, with a preference for bizarre visuals without context, you'll think the movie is brilliant. If you like a movie to have more than empty style, if you want it to have substance, meaning, hope and a storyline of some kind, with characters you care about, you have described something that Lynch does not care about, and will not produce. This film is the most pure example of that; he eventually met his karma with Twin Pinks, when his nonsensical and bizarre scenes reached the point where it became clear he was jerking around his audience to no purpose with no plot in mind, and the series was canceled suddenly at the height of its popularity; a singular thing to happen to a popular series I think.Thankfully, Lynch has been on a decline ever since, and people have finally caught on to his Picasso-like style of painting something bizarre for its own sake, and letting audiences read into it whatever they want, with no real direction or statement intended or cared about. If there was ever a movie that deserves to be lost deep under what it is named for, it's this one. There is only one mystery that remains that is a big one; how did a screenplay this incoherent, horribly written (especially the dialogue), and meaningless get approved with a budget of $40 million? Are the studios this easy to dupe? Please sign me up....",Dune

When are people going to see movies as movies and not as books. Does anyone know the original story of King Arthur? There was no christianity in the time he existed.

It's impossible to remove any bias from a re-make when you've seen an earlier adaptation, but I tried. This movie, which David Lynch has said publicly time and time again was his greatest disappointment, still holds up in my mind and is superior to the newest attempt in 2021. The atmosphere of Lynch's Dune pulls you in and keeps you there in his universe until the end credits roll. Granted, the special effects don't stand the test of time too well but the characters, actual acting, and storyline are all here in it's glory and do stand up even today! Do yourself a favor and watch, or re-watch this one with an open mind, open heart, and open hand!Thus I have spoken.Cheers!",Dune
311,Hereticked,So Close Yet So Far,6,5 March 2018,"I had only seen David Lynch's 1984 production of Dune once before when I was much younger, so when I got the chance to see a midnight screening of it at my local theater, I jumped on it. Going into this screening I recalled the movie being somewhat goofy, probably because I had just read all six of the original Dune novels the first time I saw it and OF COURSE it didn't come close to holding up to that lengthy, legendary storyline.Frank Herbert's universe had seemingly endless plots, subplots, characters and themes. Dune has all the sex, violence and political machinations of Game of Thrones while also concentrating on much more weighty issues like technology, ecology, drug use, spirituality, the destiny of mankind, etc. The depth of Dune is too much for any movie to come close to capturing and that's the brick wall that David Lynch runs into. He can't possibly do the source material justice; not on a thematic level anyway. He can only capture the forms and some of the spectacle from the first book.That said, I did enjoy it slightly more this second time, probably because I was focusing on its artistic merit and what David Lynch does well rather than mercilessly comparing it to the scope of the books. The first half of the film is steady, well presented and follows the book fairly well but somewhere around the middle of the movie the pace dramatically speeds up and they start cramming way too much story into too little screen time as events hurtle toward a hasty, contrived conclusion.I wish that Lynch hadn't shoved so many of the characters thoughts into recorded voice overs. Apparently this was done because the studio demanded he cut his original 3 hour version of the film by 40 minutes. I get that anyone who hasn't read Dune would have a hard time comprehending what was going on without all that exposition, but I think the film would've benefited greatly by saying less. Let the mysterious remain mysterious and focus on those inspired visuals! If people want to unravel it all, they can go back and read the novel. What a torture, to have to read one of the most important works of science fiction ever!For all its flaws, the film nails quite a few elements of ""Dune."" It's very well cast and most of the costumes / sets are spot on. Even the pronunciations of Herbert's fictional terminology are mostly correct and Paul's dream sequences are splendid to behold, evoking the symbolism and artistry you expect to flow from the prose of the book.The film ends on a bit of an eye roll. Muad Dib and the Fremen win a crazy one-sided battle, he kills Feyd in the duel (Sting was surprisingly good in this role for someone who's not, primarily, an actor), Paul proclaims a new dawn of humanity and it suddenly rains for the first time on Dune. Really David? That rain wasn't in the book and you couldn't think of a better way to end it? How about after the proclamation we have a nice long zoom in on Paul transitioning into visions of the future from the subsequent five books? Muad Dib's fall, the trials of his children, the God Emperor and the rise of the Honored Matres! Paul is soaked in spice at this point so he's already getting glimpses of the future. Even just a brief montage eluding to those events with the dramatic score in the background would've made a great ending to your acid trip of a movie! But no, we get a sadly typical put-a-bow-on-it Hollywood ending and fade to credits.Despite its shortcomings, I'm not overly disappointed. Adapting Dune is too great a task for anyone and it was fun to see Lynch try. Although much of the substance is missing, he succeeded in capturing the dramatic weight of Dune and painting a dazzling silver screen portrait of my favorite novel. It will be interesting to see if Denis Villeneuve can do better.",Dune
312,elgrego,"Astounding Visual World, Twisted and Dark As Was the Book",10,6 October 2006,"I just never got the folks who hated this movie. Plot concessions (compared to the book) were made, but all of the basic plot lines and characters were included. The amazing part was how Lynch was able to imagine and bring to life the Sci Fi/Fantasy elements in a way which pushed the story line forward. The actors were very well directed (mostly) and a more handsome cast men and women are not to be found. However, the duologue is very stylized--just as it is in the book. Actually, without reading the book, it may be difficult to ""get"" the reason for much in the movie. But then you have to let go of your expectation that everything in the book will be in the movie--it would need to be about 20 hours long. (The book is long as well, and this just covers the first of a bunch of em.) It is SciFi Fantasy on a very grand scale, and the book is the best of em all.---The ""Baron"" is appropriately disgusting and fat and scary. Really disgusting. Paul is mysterious but played a bit cold (compared to the book), perhaps necessary to emphasize his transformation. The ""Witches"" are just phenomenally cast and played. Sting (the musician) plays a major part (Feyd) surprisingly well and in 1984 had an amazing body which he shows off. The main conceptual elements driving the books complex plot are all present: Eugenics taken to extreme, Science/Technology Limitations and the result, Feudalism, a nominal relationship to Islam, a messianic story, Ecological Balance - - - all wrapped up in a brilliant visual piece. But this is an adult piece. No Star Wars concessions to marketing toys and fart jokes for six year olds. There is very adult sexuality which really would be disturbing for a child or young adolescent. 10/10 for being a true must-see if you are a Sci Fi fan.",Dune

For the first time I understood everything. And realized the makers understood nothing (I don't want to lay it all on Lynch, we all know what the people with the money sometimes can do. ""See Terry Gilliam Brazil.""). I then hated the movie.Now I have read all six books. I feel I know every inch of Arrakis. The final verdict for DUNE now is that it's OK.

314,lokidog,Very Bad Realization of a Great Story,4,10 September 2006,"This film is terrible. The latest version has the directors name as Allen Smithee - meaning that the real director disavowed any relation to it (David Lynch).The original problems in the release were largely thought to be the confusing plots and language. However, I never thought that was it. I had recently read the book and then saw the movie (not always a good idea). But I knew the plot, and the language. Much of the story is in the film too - perhaps too much. I remember thinking I wanted to physically harm Dino De Laurentis for producing it. The acting is horrible - at times it seems a parody of old spaghetti westerns. The dialog is even worse - who wrote this drivel? Language that seems fine in the novel just fails on screen. And voiceovers - get rid of them! Do it with visuals. They only work in very select situations.The editing is also horrible. The cuts seem to jump around so randomly that I suspect this is what most confused the original audience. I think the editors tried to keep up a time-line continuity, but it was not necessary - it would have been much better to focus and stay with the small stories throughout the movie (and just leave out many of the non-essential sequences).The only things in the film worthwhile are the photography, and visual effects. Quite advanced for the time. Perhaps the only negative here are the dream/vision sequences - these look like they were added later and quickly.",Dune
315,Erick_Till,Dune 1984 - Lynch's mistake,5,23 October 2021,"Watching the two versions of Dune and considering that almost 40 years separate the films, it's easy to understand why people speak so badly of Lynch's version and so highly of Villeneuve. From my point of view, Duna 1984's biggest problem is the wrong choice of actors. With rare exceptions, actors were poorly chosen and poorly cast.Maclachlan is too old for the role and lacks the charisma needed for the character. He doesn't seem old enough to be the son of Francesca Annis who in real life was just 14 years older. Patrick Stewart and Max Von Sydow are an absurd waste cast in secondary roles when they could be the real villains.This version shows that planets are practically inhabited by men, whose main objective in life is to fight and die. If there are women, it is witches or old Fremen ladies who are candidates for maids. This is a sexist view of women, in force in the 80s, brought to the screen by Lynch. We don't even see teenagers or children. That makes the movie fake right away. Villeneuve probably managed to see and correct this.Finally the movie is destroyed by the choice of villains who are absolutely ridiculous. See that at this time there are several movies with villains who are really villains. In Dune 2021, Skarsgard and Bautista are real villains, but in 1984 the villains are a pastiche, like they came out of a Tim Burton movie, acting aimlessly and motivated by some personal craziness. I could analyze each character, but it's a waste of time. Lynch had a good story, resources to hire good actors, but he got the cake recipe wrong. That's why there was no edition that could save this soap opera. In contrast Dune 2021 is nice and consistent. Period.",Dune

I have not read the book, so maybe after reading the book I will watch it again with a fresh perspective, however it is not good that the film is so damn hard to follow. It is like nothing I have ever seen before and it was simply annoying in places. I was glad to get to the end of it. However having said this, I did WANT to sit through it. I felt quite contented to give it a go, and so perhaps it is not all bad, because if a movie doesn't hook me fairly quickly, I don't usually sit through the lot. So....yeah. Triumph? Or Trainwreck?

318,dalcazar-1,Terrible attempt at book adaptation,1,7 May 2011,"Or proof that David Lynch has no talent, there are two things wrong with this movie, the screenplay and the direction.The screenplay is just terrible, there is no way the universe of Dune could have been explained in a 2 hour movie, but the attempt was none the less made by having the whole first half of the film attempt to introduce us to the way the universe stands in the year 10,000 and something. After we're introduced to it, the entire rest of the story is crammed into the other half of them film, it doesn't fit and only a few loose ends and tails fit into that half, so we see bits here and pieces there and it doesn't make sense. It makes so little sense in fact that when it finally ends, you have no idea what the actual meaning of the last scene is from the perspective of the story the way Frank Herbert meant it. And this also is a showcase of why we don't usually get to hear what characters think: Whispered thoughts, monologues and dreams are cheesy and in this case reinforce the feeling that the characters are legally retarded.And that brings me to the direction. You could be tempted to blame the casting people for choosing people that suck or the actors for having no talent, but when you get to see acting powerhouses like Patrick Stewart or Jurgen Prochnow reading crap lines and delivering terrible performances along with everyone else, you get the feeling that it's not their fault. You rarely get to see what a terrible director is like, but this is one of those cases. The fake fist pounding we see over and over conveys no frustration, the lines and acting are either dripping with cheese or lacking any emotion. You can almost hear the director yelling cut and telling the actors that it has to be worse, not better.I could go on and on but best to lay this all at Mr Lynch's feet because it's his fault this thing got released anyway. It's sloppy, it's hurried and it's a right mess.Watch this if you're in for a laugh, but if you take it seriously you'll hate it. There are good things about this movie but I won't bother to tell you about them because it just isn't worth watching for cinematography or storytelling.",Dune
319,travis-j-rodgers,One of the best sci fi movies ever,9,13 May 2005,"I remember watching this film when I was really young and really liking it. As I got older, I saw it a few times and always thought highly of it. I have never read Dune, but I read the last book of the series, Chapterhouse: Dune. That book was pretty amazing, so given that most people say Dune was Herbert's best work, it must be pretty damn good. So I hadn't seen Dune again until recently when I sort of discovered David Lynch. I watched a ton of his short films and have now seen just about everything he's done except for Eraserhead. I went back and watched the Sci Fi Miniseries and then the original Dune. My thoughts on Dune...I don't know how faithful this rendering is to the book, but regardless, it stands on its own as a masterpiece. For the most part, I think the casting was inspired. MacLachlan is ""too old"" for Paul, but he's incredible. Sean Young was amazing. Patrick Stewart, Dean Stockwell, and Sting, all amazing. Lynch makes the setting believably dark, in a style similar to many of his other pieces.I'd say my only complaint is the special effects for ships in space. Some of the ships look really bad (such as Shaddam's golden ship). Other than that, the effects are great, including the Wailing Module, the Voice, and the worms in most shots. I should add that Lynch's rendering is a bit more positive than Herbert's conclusion to the Dune story, but that should not detract in the least. If you're even remotely a fan of the genre, or of fantasy, or of philosophical/political work, you ought to see this movie. The 6/10 rating is ridiculously low and unfair. I give it a 9/10 and suggest that it's every bit as good as the Star Wars films (IV-VI).",Dune
320,jrichards2-1,Disappointing - SPOILERS HERE,6,7 November 2004,"Dune begins rather promisingly: freaky aliens, cut-throat space politics and a truly revolting villain. Don't you just love that old hand-in-the-box scene? 'Flesh burning...flesh falling off...' He he! And later on, down on the creepy planet, we have that excellent bit with the flying needle thingy. I remembered it from yonks ago, when I watched the film last. Stuff like that sticks on the brain.I realized that the film was plummeting towards a low when Paul harnessed the giant sand worm and started riding it about the place. This, combined with a dopey girlfriend ('You're my whole life...bla bla bla'), the suspect return of Patrick Stewart from what I thought was certain death, and lots of weird visions of water drops and hands drifting around the place, makes for a rotten conclusion. Rarely have I seen such a good start squandered! The last word was when Sting, who'd already been given a lot of time on screen moping about the place giving his uncle something to look at, challenged Paul to a knife fight. It wasn't good. There was no excitement in the scene because by now we all know that our hero's going to survive and rule the universe. No fun at all.Six out of ten. That's misleading, however. The first half is eight and a half whilst the second half is more like three. Ko, Izzy.",Dune
321,inc-10,Impossible mission failed,3,2 August 2008,"If I had to direct Dune movie, I neither would know where to start. But this ancient piece - or rather ""Ruining a story 101"" is failed beyond imagination.First, Lynch tried to use up whole book of Dune. That's a mistake. Even bigger one is that he never grasped the content, it's all 1:1 replayed. So, viewer has no real idea what's going on. Did director?To fit several hundred of pages into compact a movie, you have to know what to pick and what's important. None of this in movie. It's like he took every sub-story from book and cut off first and last quarter of it, so all subplots have middle part, progression, but no intro or conclusion. Special effects are crazy. They're really ""special"" because if often feels like clay motion, not a movie. Nothing alive or fluid, especially painful for worms who yawn most of the movie. Strange enough, same goes for real actors, I guess they tried to catch up with static poses and acting of ""worms"". I don't think that some parts of the movie could be done without modern 3D technology, Lynch should have waited 20 years or so. Shields and explosions look REALLY bad, same for blue eyes.For costumes, some were quite cool, like stillsuits and uniforms of Atreides. Then again, some downright sucked (Atreides/Harkonnen/Sardaukar solider suits).I have no idea why Lynch pictured far future in noir style of 50's, and I think I don't want to. It's elegant, but not futuristic in any way.And finally, gross. Why are so many things so gross in this movie? Dead walls of fremen hideouts, eerie makeup on most characters (especially irritating Thufir Hawat's mouth) rotting face of Vladimir Harkonnen and those awful, awful space navigators. It's like watching intestines of some animal for 3 hours.I wouldn't want to go through this again. I think this movie would make a nice learning for cinema schools ""How to mess up a movie"".Avoid.",Dune
322,reginald-anselm,Unappreciated masterpiece(big spoilers ahead),9,1 November 2012,"Prologue: In the year 10191(not the Christian calender), the Padishah-Emperor grants House Atreides(the heroes) rulership over Arrakis(Dune), replacing their enemy, House Harkonnen(the bad guys). Arrakis is the only planet in the universe that contains the spice melange, a drug that the entire universe is addicted to due to the vitality it provides people and because the Spacing Guild need it to teleport their ships through space. The Guild, the Emperor and House Harkonnen plot the destruction of the Atreides(hence the Emperor's ""generosity""). The Guild, having precognition due to spice view Duke Leto's son Paul as a threat. The Emperor views House Atreides as a threat due to their new Weirding Modules(sonic guns). The Harkonnens just hate them.Story: A Guild Navigator arrives on Kaitain(the Emperor's homeworld) to ask for details of the Conspiracy. Using her telepathic powers, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam(representative of a group of women who manipulated DNA through generations to create a male superbeing with the power to see the future) finds out that the Guild fear Paul so she goes to Caladan(the Atreides homeworld) to test him(with a pain box). Paul passes the test. Subsequently, House Atreides (which is led by Duke Leto, his concubine Jessica, their son Paul, the Mentat(human computer) Thufir Hawat, the Swordmaster Duncan Idaho, the Suk Doctor Wellington Yueh and the superloyal Gurney ""Picard"" Halleck) travels to Arrakis to take over from the Harkonnens. Meanwhile on Giedi Prime, the evil Mentat Piter De Vries(Grima Wormtongue) takes Leto's message to the psycho-Baron Vladimir Harkonnen who is not too happy and finalizes the Conspiracy. He orders Captain Nefud to summon Feyd-Rautha and Rabban(his nephews) and has Piter pound the importance of success in them (if the Landsraad, the union of Houses finds out about the Conspiracy, they're all screwed). The psycho-Baron also informs them that he has a spy in House Atreides. Back on Arrakis, Duke Leto meets with Duncan(who has been negotiating with the Fremen, a group of nomads living in the desert) who informs him that there might be a larger number of Fremen than originally thought. Being a paranoid perfectionist on defence, Thufir's in charge of the safety. When his people find one bomb after another easily, he becomes extremely concerned of how easy it is. Dr. Yueh is inspecting the Harkonnen corpses and finds a secret message in one that he doesn't want to Thufir to know of(the veteran must be blind not to notice Yueh move the X-Ray). Meanwhile, Duke Leto, Paul and Gurney go on a spice production tour with Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Planetologist who has secretly become a Fremen leader. The trip ends in a disaster but the Atreides make a good impression on Kynes. Back at the palace, Dr. Yueh and Jessica check the Fremen servants. Among them is the Shadout Mapes, a spy(for the Fremen, not the bad guys). In his room, Paul has a spice snack and nearly gets assassinated by a floating needle. Mapes informs him that there's a traitor amongst the Atreides. Another Harkonnen corpse is found with a needle controller. Soon, Dr. Yueh(the Harkonnen spy) neutralizes the shield protecting the palace, allowing the Harkonnen ships to attack it and also destroys the Weirding Modules, preventing the Atreides from effectively defending themselves from a combination of strong Harkonnen forces and the Imperial Sardaukar. Only a few escape with their lives. Yueh personally captures Duke Leto and explains that he's doing all this in order to assassinate the Baron(Who killed his wife) via the Duke and plants a tooth containing poison gas in his mouth. Duncan tries to save Paul and Jessica and gets killed in the process. Gurney escapes(with the Duke's dog). House Harkonnen wins. Paul and Jessica are sent to the desert to die but they escape the Harkonnen troops thanks to some help from Yueh's survival kit he planted there to redeem himself. The two of them meet and join the Fremen with the promise that they teach them how to use the Weirding Modules(that Yueh left the plans for). Meanwhile, Leto's assassination fails and he ends up killing Piter instead. Paul falls in love, Jessica becomes a Reverend Mother, Paul becomes a messiah, Gurney joins the Fremen, Kynes is abandoned in the desert by Rabban, Thufir becomes a demented Mentat for the Harkonnens. 2 YEARS LATER Using the tactics taught to him and the Weirding Modules, the Fremen effectively halt spice production. Fearing Paul, the Spacing Guild order the Emperor to return order to Arrakis. He decides to destroy all life there. To counter that, Paul uses the Water of Life(sandworm puke) to finally achieve his full potential(oh and he gets a sister). The Emperor arrives on Arrakis and starts by executing Rabban. The Baron isn't very pleased. Using atomics, Paul breaks into his old palace and conquers the Sardaukar. The Baron is killed by Paul's sister. In the finale, Paul declares himself Emperor(not corruption), takes complete control over the universe and kills Feyd-Rautha(the last Harkonnen). Thufir also commits suicide. AND THEN IT RAINS ON ARRAKIS FOR NO REASON.Personal view: This movie is just awesome. But it failed due to the lack of time given to it. The movie mainly focuses on the first half of the novel and then turns the second part into a montage.",Dune
323,gigabyte-me,Sci-Fi Classic.,8,19 April 2007,"Let me start out by saying this is the only David Lynch film that makes sense. All other David Lynch films are pure nonsense. For some reason however he was meant to direct this Sci-Fi epic.The movie has an almost Gothic feel to it. Not GOTH don't get the two confused, just because you dress like a vampire, dye your hair black and are depressed doesn't mean you'll like this film. Dune can lend its Gothic nature to the set design and costumes. There's an almost Victorian feel to the architecture and clothing in the film and if you are one who pays close attention to this type of thing, you'll appreciate this.I found for it's time Dune had a fairly substantial array of special effects. They did the job just fine for this film, especially considering it was made in the mid 80's.Of course there are enough David Lynch elements in the direction and dialogue in this film to give it a slightly surreal slant but in this case that is a good thing. The surreal nature of Dune makes it almost feel like Science Fiction meets fever dream. This formula works and lends to the bizarre nature of the film. Also another aspect I grew to like over time about Dune is many of the character's thoughts are often narrated by their own voices. This at first can put you off but after a while grows on you and adds to the dreamy nature of Dune. There are enough memorable characters, epic scenes and decent special effects to immerse you properly into the film's atmosphere. The story is good although in many ways deviates from the book generously. I'm sure die-hard fans of Frank Herbert fans scowl at this. However to the film's credit, I read the novel Dune and I think the movie is much better.It would be safe to say you should probably be a fan of the Sci-Fi genre to truly appreciate this film but if you are and for some reason haven't seen this yet, I recommend it. Dune is a film you can watch more than once. In fact it may take you a few views with full attention to get every nuance of the film and piece together the plot properly, but it's worth it. Good Sci-Fi classic.",Dune

Home of the fantastic hate from the secretly admirers of this (very) underrated work of Art. And let us not fool ourselves; it is a work of Art, whether fanboys of the Books care to admit it or not (they love it, but dare not say it).All the troubles from the meddling studio and producer aside, this is a Lynch movie. And what would you expect from a Lynch movie? Bizarre and amazing things of course.It follows the Dune (first) Book quite well. But what is interesting is that it cuts out all unnecessary things that would not do a damn thing to the story itself. Instead, Lynch adds things that don't exist in the original story and they work excellent (the weirding module, Baron's skin disease - typical Lynch moves).By the way, let the - ""it's not exactly like the book, so I hate it, but I love it in secret"" - fanboys cry all they want; because even the Books Author (Frank Herbert) loved it:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zw10o48NoEAnd what is there not to love when you have:A superb cast of actors. - A superb Sound Track - A superb visual feast of effects and scenery - A rather interesting choice of wardrobe. - The inclusion of Lynch's own material and cutting of unimportant clutter. - Memorable shots and sequences.In the end, could it be better?

327,ef-45789,A Complicated story makes a complicated movie,6,20 June 2021,"I remember going to the theater to see this, and when you bought your ticket, they handed you a ""cheat sheet"" of definitions unique to the story. I had read the book, so I already knew what ""Bene Gesserit"" meant; however my friends who had not heard of Frank Herbert were pretty lost. A lot of people were expecting Star Wars and DUNE 1984 fell short from two major aspects: 1)explanation and development of the numerous complicated plot points, and, 2)the dinky early 80's special effects. Star Wars Industrial Light and Magic were literally light years ahead of what Dune presented (basically lot of miniatures that looked like, well, miniatures.)Rather than comparing Dune with Star Wars, a more valid comparison is Lord of Rings with it's themes of religion, politics, and warfare/ competition of various subcultures including alien species like Elves, Dwarves. Orcs, etc. Peter Jackson did a marvelous job of setting up a similarly complicated story and cutting things that were not essential to the primary plot. As an example, I would have loved to see Tom Bombadill in the movie, but I also understand that you can't get people to go to three 6 hour movies. So Lynch leaves holes in the story and hands out a cheat sheet instead- not real effective and the box office reflected that...Just FYI, I gave Lynch 6 stars for having the guts to try it. Watching a Guild Navigator fold space by shooting spice gas out of his butt is not something you get to see everyday-Looking forward to the 2021 version.",Dune
328,strange-6,"Not a bad movie, just different",7,6 September 1999,"Dune is real Sci-fi, either the book or novel create very complex worlds and people. Of course, it was very difficult to put all the Dune books together in one film, maybe this is the reason why Dune is so severely underrated, the longer version can help a bit to understand better what is happening. I must admit that the last half hour of the 135m version is so rushed that you cannot focus your attention, and it gives the impression that the editors of the film were in a hurry to finish. And the FX are not as great as you could hope.Nevertheless, Dune is not a bad movie, it is a different approach to the sci-fi genre. If you love Star Wars, Star Trek, the Alien saga and other action packed space movies, it may be that you won't like Dune.

329,blakeboyuk,Science Fiction Treasure,9,4 June 2007,"I came to watch this film with a unique perspective, after playing the Commodore Amiga classic Dune II. I must mention that I have never read the novel or seen the TV series.The computer game was fascinating to me, a real time strategy war game that came to define a genre. I believe the C&C series were spawned from it. Apart from its revolutionary engine, the game had a mysterious and intriguing plot. One felt part of a huge conflict & the game evoked a real sense of the barren and hostile terrain of Dune. It remains one of my favourite titles of all time.The film had quite a lot to live up to. Could such a film be as revolutionary and enjoyable as the computer game? My answer would be a resounding YES! It became clear that the mystery and atmosphere of the game had been purged straight from the movie. The visual imagery is key to the success of this film; costume, set and six combine to great effect. The large budget is clear for all to see! The story is played out on an epic scale, with the use of train of thought narrative and colourful characterisation from the main cast. In fact, often the dialogue was reminiscent of a melodramatic Shakespearean play. There are too many strong performances to choose from in this film, although Jurgen Prochnow deserves particular praise for his role as the Duke.Admittedly, Dune is one of those films you have to watch more than once to truly understand. The plot shifts at alternate paces and lasts well over two hours. However, this shouldn't be seen as a problem. I found it refreshing to watch a challenging and complex story, after all this genre more than any works best when it's not dumbed down. Dune remains the most sumptuous Science Fiction epic ever conceived, I highly recommend it!",Dune
330,christopherbarton26,Interesting,6,12 November 2015,"I watched this movie for the first time in about twenty years. I have not read the books but I only have one observation. When I first saw the movie I thought it was a mess and found it hard to watch.However what I saw on my second viewing recently an attempt, I don't know if David Lynch thought this because he never speaks about it,as what we see quite commonly now as comic book movies created from their own comic book creations.Everything is done on such a grand scale right down to the quality of the cast but you could look at it as a series of well framed shots. Very similar to the first Michael Keaton Batman venture.Several frames looking great as a still. Even the thought dialogue would have fit nicely into bubbles. All sounds basic but think about it. I think it may have been the first picture book movie as an adaptation from a novel.I know its not a major thought but I now find the movie more interesting and innovative.",Dune
331,Rosebud815,Five bags of popcorn,10,12 September 2016,"Dune retains the Lynch feel in another completely different world. Even his trademark white noise even makes appearances here and there. The concept of time-folding that Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLaughlin) eventually discovers is actually very similar to the concept of transcendence, a state of being involving a release of the soul in acceptance, involvement and participation in the present moment in the universe. The spice is also a wonderful concept: the universe in Dune runs something cultivated by people at the bottom of their space society. It took Muad'dib, the Fremen's prophetic leader to break them free of their chains, taking the spice away from their rulers and Dune for themselves. Paul Atreides became the messiah, the Kwisatz Haderach through his self-discovery of unprecedented power, causing rain to fall on Dune for the first time ever. Dune is a fun, fearless, no-holds-barred sci-fi about control, power and energy in the journey through space and time.",Dune
332,cedde6,So what about a director's cut?,9,9 July 2009,"I read ""Dune"" in 1984, prior to watching David Lynch's adaptation but with his film's visuals in mind (thanks to the magazines of the time). I fell in love with the book (of course) and soon after with the movie.Problems during the course of its production, unwise (if not poor) decisions regarding its visual effects and the pressure of condensing a very complex material in 2 hours mark all conspired against the quality of the piece, the main victims here being the story telling (which is really not great) and the pace (which is somewhat unbalanced and even clumsy). But despite of all its major flaws, I believe that David Lynch's film remains a unique piece of cinema for which a major re-assessment is long overdue and much needed. Lynch is a creator-director renowned for its vivid and otherworldly imageries and ""Dune"" is no exception. In fact the film is full of striking moments (Princess Irulan's opening sequence, the visit of the 3rd stage Navigator to the Emperor, the Harkonnens first introduction, the Atreides ships entering the immense Guild high liners etc...). Its design in general makes it a fascinating picture to watch. The sets were sumptuous (even by today's standards), the costumes superb and varied, Freddie Francis's photography outstanding and the extraordinary all-star ensemble cast provided some wonderful and memorable performances. ""Dune"" might not be flashy and ""futuristically"" demonstrative (quite the contrary in fact) which actually add to its charms but it is all gravitas and nobility, unconventional, challenging, strange and... (well okay, granted:) intellectual. These were some of the reasons why the movie was almost universally paned upon its release (ironically by the very same critics that would complain about the formulaic and predictable nature of Hollywood films). The movie simply fell victim of the expectations as it did not come out as the pop-corn blockbuster some quarters have expected back then (which in itself is very strange considering the tone of the original material and the very nature of the director).Whether one love(d) or loathe(d) this film, ""Dune"" could hardly be accused of being banal or clichéd now, could it? For its defence the film main merit is to exist at all. ""Dune"" is a book that cannot be adapted effectively (as proved years later by its somewhat insipid TV adaptation) and yet the film is there in all its beauty and relative failure.As noted in some other reviews on here, the TV version of the film which was atrociously re-cut and CRIMINALLY re-framed, boasts however some never seen before footages and scenes that could have benefited the movie if only producer Dino de Laurentiis had agreed to release a three hours epic. Hey! There's an idea! Wouldn't that be cool if David Lynch was granted a director's cut? I know that would sure make me a happy bunny. And I also know that there are some of you out there that would agree...",Dune
333,MarsFKA,Unrelentingly Awful,1,21 June 2008,"When this film was released in 1984, I had some misgivings, as putting Frank Herbert's epic novel on to the big screen was always going to rank with the labours of Hercules. So I went to see it and came away convinced that I has just seen the worst big-budget film of all time. Its crippling handicap was the quality of the screen writing. As I watched it, I tried to relate the portrayed characters to their counterparts in the book and found that I could not recognise a single one. I wondered if David Lynch had actually read the book before he wrote the screenplay. The acting was dreadful and the dialogue was worse. I have seen most of the cast in other films where they were actually permitted to act, which is just as well, or I would have grown up thinking that they were all overblown, second-rate hams. The biggest piece of mis-casting was to have Patrick Stewart play Gurney Halleck - he deserved much better than that and I hope he didn't spend too long regretting accepting this role. Choosing another at random: Everitt McGill as Stilgar was less than memorable, not being allowed to act, but simply progressing from one sonorous pronouncement to the next.The sets were brilliant - I have no quarrel with that part of the film - but imaginative backdrops alone cannot bolster a production where the quality of the script and acting - or rather, the direction - fell so dismally short of any acceptable standard.The costumes were also very well done, with one notable, and very important exception: Lynch clearly forgot most of what he had read in the book when he approved the final design of the Fremen stillsuits.On occasion, over the intervening twenty-odd years, when I have thought about this unrelentingly awful film, it has been more in regret than anger. Despite this, I never really gave up on it and, four months ago, when I found the three-hour extended version, at a price that made it worth the effort, I bought it in the hope that some extra added footage might give the wretched thing some credibility.It was a forlorn hope. This extended version is an even bigger train wreck than the original theatrical release, and was clearly re-worked for television - it is easy to spot the blanks for the commercial break cues. The editing is quite incompetent and added scenes that have no context in the story line at the place where they were inserted - for example, one repeated scene showed the same Harkonnen ship approaching the landing field at Arrakeen. Another piece of sloppy editing early in the film had Reverend Mother Helen Gaius Mohaim being transported to Caladan, the home world of House Atriedes, by the same two Harkonnen pilots that took Jessica and Paul into the deep desert on Dune, after the Harkonnen attack.There was one particular, poignant part of the novel that both versions of the film left hanging, and which deserved to be included. That was the death of Thufir Hawat, at the end, after the Imperial forces had surrendered to Duke Paul Atreides. In the film, this life-long servant of House Atreides was left standing among the Imperial captives, gazing vacantly at the ceiling, suffering from the terminal effects of the residual poison that the Harkonnens had infected him with after they captured him on Dune and subverted him to their own service. In the book, however, the dying Hawat was given a poisoned needle by Emperor Shaddam and Reverend Mother Mohaiam and ordered to assassinate Paul, this 'upstart Duke', when he stood before him. Hawat disobeyed, and as he he stood before Paul, he turned to the Emperor in a magnificent gesture, holding out his hand with the needle in its palm and said, ""See, Majesty? See your traitor's needle? Did you think that I who've given my life to service to the Atreides would give them any less now?"" Then he collapsed and died in his Duke's arms.I have read that David Lynch wanted nothing to do with the extended version, and he was right to disown it. Even so, with the original release, there was so much that he could have done to turn Frank Herbert's novel into something memorable. Instead, he made an abomination that deserves to dumped into the same rubbish can as that dreadful Starship Troopers.",Dune
334,simenkv,Excellent adaption of Herbert's Dune.,9,29 November 2002,"I have always been a David Lynch-fan, but was nervous to see this movie at last: The film has the reputation of being perhaps Lynch' weakest film. I don't get it, that people say this.The movie is visually strong, the plot is strong (of course; being a close adaption of Frank Herbert's masterpiece), it has (mostly) great performances (Kenneth McMillan as the baron Harkonnen, for instance) and the music (by Toto) is also top notch.I think maybe why people dislike Dune is that they don't understand what kind of movie they are seeing: It is not action, not space opera, it is not drama and it is (in some ways) not a ""typical"" David Lynch movie. The story is very strong, has some heavy implications when it comes to humanity and maybe identity, and tries to do something that seldom is done on film. (In my opinion.) This is science fiction as it is supposed to be.I won't say too much. (Probably someone else has said what I wanted to before me.) My advice: Go see the movie and do not expect Star Wars, and do not expect Blue Velvet. Feel the movie instead of comparing it to some other flick.I gave it 9 out of 10, which i rarely do.

The cinematography in the '84 version was so much better and the characters more captivating. True, some of the characters were not well developed such as Duncan Idaho, which I assume ended up on the cutting room floor. I never understood what happened with Gurney Halleck and suddenly re-appearing. Again, a victim of editing I assume. Anyway, the filming was awesome. The newer version was just a little drab. The '21 version explains some missing details. But then again, This was just the 1st installment. OMG, another epic still to come !

Kind of like what you did not have enough money to make another 20 dollar wood model of a troop to blow up haha. It does tell the story well although over the top at times but still quite enjoyable.

338,Hotwyre6,Cast is biggest letdown,1,28 March 2006,"I hate to begin any rant with a disclaimer, but I do have to say that Lynch, who is usually superb, was working with some of the best actors in the business. However, as a fan boy watching his very favorite science fiction novel translated to the big screen, I have to say I couldn't imagine a cast less suited to the task.The best example of this in the film is the choice of casting Patrick Stewart in the role of Gurney Halleck. Stewart interprets the role as a pompous and boisterous swashbuckling type, an ever present aura of conceit and ""panache"" accompanying his instruction as he trains young Atreides in the martial sciences. Somehow, the grizzled mercenary who was tortured by the Harkonnen, serving out of gratitude for his rescue from their dread clutches, hard edged and mentally scarred, is translated into this ""Pirates of Penzance"" extra. This is a far cry from his portrayal in the novel, and serves as an example of just how far from the spirit of the book the film went.MacLachlan, Madsen, and Young just do not convince me in their respective roles, and while they deliver their dialog competently, I see their interpretations as being at odds with the complexity of the characters that Herbert created. Maybe my translation of the characters simply differed from Lynch's; I am unconvinced, however, as the later incarnation on SciFi channel seemed to fit my reading of the novel's dialog to a far closer (and much better acted) degree. I can only conclude that Lynch somehow fell victim to typical ""Hollywood-ization"" (rare for him) and cast the film according to what was seen as hip at the time. The exceptions to this rule are Sting and Dean Stockwell, who stood out amongst their contemporaries and fulfilled their roles expertly.To compound the problem, the cinematic devices used to tell the story fall short of doing so with any clarity. Even fan boys who know the story (like myself) would have trouble following events. An uninitiated viewer would be lost within 30 minutes, and if they felt anything like myself, they just wouldn't care. I can't even chalk up a worthy effort on this one; this film gets the flat end of this reviewer's frying pan.",Dune

This is not true of Dune.Not primarily played for laughs, love interest and- most crucially- not aimed at 12-year olds, Dune is a big film: big in conception; big in execution.Frank Herbert's Dune novel was a major (and weighty) contribution to the traditional sci-fi genre. Strong narrative combines with novel ideas and strange landscapes to great effect. What is happening unfolds only gradually. Lynch & co have performed an excellent job in translating this so faithfully to the silver screen. Because this is not dumbed-down sci-fi for pre-teens there have been howls of protest that it demands attention to understand what is going on. It does!Here we have a story on screen that- certainly- features special effects and alien landscapes, but which is also sombre and strange. It is- as the original novel was- packed to bursting with ideas. At the end you are left panting for more, wanting to know where the story will go, what will happen next: all that is how it should be; the shame is that we never saw a sequel.",Dune

343,muligens,Not Lynch's finest moment,3,10 December 2016,"I'm a massive fan of David Lynch and I also love the Dune book. Yet I've never gotten around to watching Dune until now. I admit the terrible reputation of the movie has been a big part of why I've avoided it, but how bad can it really be right? The answer is, pretty bad.I has some of the hammiest acting I have ever seen. Some of it was so bad I had to turn away from the screen in embarrassment. The bad guys are all total caricatures and it was hard to take anyone seriously. Camper than a jamboree, but not in a fun way.The score was also pretty bad. 80's operatic rock has never been a favourite and Toto certainly pulls out all the stops here. We're bombarded by majestic electric guitars way past the point of over-saturation.And worst of all is the endless exposition. Everything happening on screen apparently has to be explained by a narrator or an inner monologue. Some of the time they're flat out describing what we can already see happening on screen.The less said about the special effects the better. In 1984 they should have been able to do a lot better.So, does it have any redeeming features? The art deco inspired sets are pretty cool. The film certainly looks interesting and unique. Unfortunately, that's about it.Worth watching once but I doubt I could sit through that again.",Dune
344,Cadriel,"An insulting ""adaptation"" of a great book.",1,31 August 2000,"Dune was considered unfilmable.  Alexandro Jodorowsky failed to get up the money for his production, as did Ridley Scott, who took up Jodorowsky's creative team.  It took nigh-endless resources from Dino de Laurentiis to complete Lynch's version.The problems with David Lynch's Dune are many.  The characters, beyond Paul, are all but undeveloped--for instance, Harkonnen is simply a grotesque figure, not a great political rival for the Atreides.  Similarly, much of the plot is simply a checklist of important scenes from the movie, cheapening Paul's internal struggles with what he is, and ruining the thematic impact of the film.  Lynch's storytelling is horrible--relying on character thought and exposition to tell things better shown.  And Lynch's own additions are abysmal--such as the contrived weirding modules.  No one and nothing is shown in the depth it acquires in the book.The final problems are incredible.  One, Paul is clearly shown as a good-guy superhero, not a man of amazing power both spiritually and temporally, who is in questionable moral ground.  Second, it rains at the end.  (This would slaughter the sandworms, destroy the spice, make conventional space travel impossible, and generally wreak havoc in the Empire.)Read the book, which is great.  Skip this garbage.",Dune
345,matitya-33937,Great Adaptation,10,26 October 2021,"I loved the book upon which it is based. And don't get me wrong the book is way better than this movie. That said, the movie is quite good.I read the book before I saw the movie and I guess it's possible to be confused by it considering the plot of the book is intentionally complicated ""wheels within wheels, circles within circles, plans within plans within plans"" especially if one hasn't priorly engaged with the source material. (Though Princess Irulan's expositional narration actually does a good job clarifying the basics and unlike the movie Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmarron it doesn't sacrifice the narrative to having constant narration in every single scene to the point of it becoming annoying).The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is depraved, pedophilic, disgusting and psychopathic (guess what he also is in the book). Sure there are aspects of his character that are exaggerated but that's necessitated by the mere fact of condensing the plot of Frank Herbert's science-fiction masterpiece.Piter de Vries is less obviously psychopathic (though the fact that they depicted him as extreme calculating makes sense given that he's a Mentat).The roles of the characters are well-acted by the people playing them.The Box of Pain could hardly have been better done.Paul Atreides is as likeable in the film as he was in the first book (there is a tragic aspect to Paul in the books but it's only emphasized in the sequels and less present in the first one and as such this film can be forgiven for downplaying it.)Sure the effects haven't aged well but that's the price of having been made in 1984.And the Bene Gesserit were spot on.I love this movie. Don't get me wrong it's nothing compared to the book upon which it was based but it's still a great movie.",Dune

Perfect actors, great fx (especially for a 1984 movie). The awesome soundtrack really supports the play.

347,CoolClones,One for the fans.,9,27 March 2003,"If memory serves, this big budget turkey was part and parcel of poor marketing by the Studio. The epic novel by Frank Herbert is a science fiction classic and huge proportions. Many attempts had been made to get it made as a film before Dino DeLaurentis just went for it. He got what he thought was the best story, and the best director in the world, David Lynch (straight after the elephant man) and just went to town.The Lynch movie is beautifully shot and the acting and characterisations are first class. Lynch also stamps his trademark on the film with his own brand of visual mystique and use of dialogue. The film's major fall down is the movie watcher is at a loss as to what is going on. The original story is quite complex, a multifaceted tale of immense scale. The ""potted"" two hour story just leaves the unfamiliar wondering.As as fan of the books, I see DUNE the movie as getting to be an eye witness at key events of the story. It's like a companion to the book. I would recommend this film to anyone who has read and enjoyed DUNE. These people would enjoy this beautifully crafted film a lot more.",Dune

The Known Universe is ruled by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, my father. In this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice Melange. The spice extends life, the spice expands consciousness, the spice is vital to space travel...."" intones a pretty lady against a starry backdrop at the start of this movie. Right so we've that out of the way, let's get down to the actual movie. Ooooops back she comes "" Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, the spice exists on only one planet in the entire universe, a desolate, dry planet with vast deserts. Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts are a people known as the Fremen, who have long held a prophecy, .. that a man would come, a messiah, who would lead them to true freedom. The planet is Arrakis,... also known as .. Dune."" Are you still reading this??? Think what it must have been like for the poor souls in the cinemas back in 1984-5. Frank Herbert's Dune was an immense literary success back in 1965 with its visions of a galactic imperium that had moved beyond technology as our culture recognizes it and begun manipulating biology and space travel. Thousands of years before, something called the Butlerian Jihad had seen humanity revolt against controlling machines and establish an almost neo-feudal power structure wherein hereditary bodies such as the Bene Gesserit and Spacing Guild play off competing planetary dynasties against each other. Herbert's novel alluded to the Middle Eastern Oil crisis, the ecological movement, hallucinogenic drugs and was shrewd enough to predict the revival of Holy War as a political force. When he agreed to collaborate with David Lynch in the early 1980s to film all this a problem arose: would the big screen adaptation be true to the novel's esoteric intellectualism or would it simply be Star Wars with a knife-wielding Sting? In the end, they opted for a action-love story with space opera elements, but kept in enough 'weird stuff' to placate any sci-fi long-hairs who had read the novel in '65. And, surprise surprise, they ended up alienating the kids and the hippies. A number of problems doom Dune to damnation. Firstly, the woefully inept casting. Kyle McLachlan is a fine actor for sure, but as a messiah to the Fremen and a love interest to Chani (Sean Young) he just doesn't cut it. To be fair, he is given an appallingly dire script which at one point has him seeking 'closure' for his Dad's brutal murder by riding on a giant worm and bellowing into the desert night ""Father...the sleeper has AWOKEN!!!!!!!!"" That's to say nothing of the annoying voice overs that riddle the movie (""I will bend like a reed in the wind"" while duelling with Sting or ""Fear is the mind killer! while having his hand toasted in a box). Also, a slew of fine actors and actresses are given walk-ons that allow them to do little more than scowl and deliver turgid dialog. Jose Ferer looks like he about to burst out laughing while addresses a massive tadpole in a tank during a visit by the Spacing Guild. That said, there are some highly ridiculous performances too. On no account watch any part where the badly dubbed cute kid Alia speaks with food or drink in your mouth because you'll risk choking. Then there are the shoddy special effects that bely the fact that Dune had a then unprecedented $50 million budget. The part when the floating baron, screaming in agony is sent hurtling through a wall to be eaten by a giant phallic worm is truly hilarious. Speaking of which, the one half-effective sequence in the movie is set on the Harkonnen home world of Giedi Prime. Recalling Lynch's Eraserhead, it is all hissing pipes and mutation. Even here, the silly dialog is ubiquitous, as the Baron's mentat intones ""It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed, the lips acquire stains, stains become a warning. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion."" Huh??? Possibly no movie in history has capped Dune for silly names..Thufir Hawat, Irulan Corrino, Paul Usul Maud Dib, Feyd Rautha Harkonnen, Shadout Mapes, Gurney Halleck, Gom Jabbar, Kwitzatz Haderach.... When you see this dire effort, you will be yelling 'Chuk....saaaa!' at your DVD player in the hope that you too, like Paul Maud Dib, can make it explode.",Dune
349,howarsmith,The whispering,2,18 August 2020,"So, there are apologists for this mess ? Must admit was probably one of them when I wanted to say this was a lost classic. Go to the ebert review to save yourself the trouble of reading this review.Still, what is it with the whispering ? This film is just exposition whispering. For the whole movie. To be fair something happens on one hour twelve minutes when the powerful woman uses her voice to prevent a sexual assault but then the fat man wearing a vent has already spat on her face during an hours sequence of random images connected only by whispering. On the plus side on 1.22.33, one of the first discernible pieces of dialogue spoken out loud in an action sequence is a fat boy slim lyric. I had always thought this lyric was 'you won't attract the one' but I can genuinely say that on rewatching this whispering mess, the words 'if you walk without rhythm you won't attract the worm ' jumped out at me like Christopher Walken off a balcony.There are 20 or so characters who get several seconds to explain their existence to no affect. My personal favourite is the pointless poison tooth section of at least two minutes that features more whispering about the baron. To be fair he is properly introduced after an hour and a half in some steam. As is semi naked tree foo tom Sting. Hang on, there's still some whispering about water and unborn children.The special effects are poor even for a film in 1984. However they are not even the main problem in this horribly stitched together nonsense where characters appear and disappear with no warning. Mind you I might have missed some whispering. The scene where he shoots the pyramid and inspires his people is just awful. Its like the Ricky Gervais inspirational speech scene from the office. Then we get the sand worms. Oh jees. Accompanied by sub Queen electric guitars and choral music.As it limps towards its conclusion, complete with reshot or hastily inserted scenes, people run up and down sand dunes to remind us of the films title while the main character drinks water, which seems a good idea. Although this brings on the radio gaga video, it does seem to move the plot on and something happens on 2 hours. There's a fight. The End.",Dune
350,Mat-23,Sooo Disappointing,4,31 May 1999,"If I ever got the chance to remake any one movie...it would be Dune, because i felt that the film was such a pathetic waste of the rights to Frank Herbert's classic book. That book was perhaps the greatest piece of writing this century, and a wonderful example of subtle political commentary, interwoven with an epic, yet minutely detailed plot. It was beautiful. David Lynch's hairy film, on the other hand, was a childish misinterpretation of the whole POINT of the book (in that the hero is made, not herbert's man playing God, but some kind of miracle-worker). It displayed all the hallmarks of a de laurentiis production: miscast actors (who are all in themselves good)directed in such a way as to appear terribly wooden, made to speak awful lines, against a background of terrible effects, purely so that the location filming can be done in some impressive landscape. (anyone remember Conan The Barbarian?). If only they had chosen something less intelligent to make this movie about, it would be fairly fun, in a cheap & cheerful way. Unfortunately, it will always be to me, a terrible waste of celluloid.",Dune

This confused me, since I had read some pretty negative reviews of it. I had to see for myself. I found a copy in an underground video store suggesting that it was the most uncut version available. It seemed like an illegal copy: the tapes inside were crudely labeled and there were Cantonese subtitles. I found the film enjoyable, despite the fact that if you miss one word you get lost and confused, like those foreign language films with speedy subtitles. I enjoyed seeing the ties between the latest strategy game with the movie, as with the first chapter I had read when I was in third grade. The acting is good, the script was good (when followed carefully), but some of the special effects were crude and should have been avoided. I have little to complain with the script, as I can see others do. The three-hour version I saw is much clearer, since many essential scenes I viewed were cut when originally released.

However, if you try to transport this book into a two hour movie, there are sure to be disappointments.  I disagree with others who think the original book is unapproachable (I read it when I was 16, and I didn't have problems). 
Given that, there are *significant* plot issues in the book that simply don't appear in the movie.  The ending of the movie could also qualify as the corniest of all time.  It turns the whole exploration of manipulating religion to serve those who would take power into a postmodern Jesus story. Taking the movie on its own, however, it is very good.  It is visually superb and it has an excellent soundtrack.  I always thought that Dune would make an excellent miniseries, and for those of us who would like to see a more faithful interpretation of the book,  it looks like we'll get our chance this fall on Sci-Fi channel.

All the visual aspects of this movie is rare, original, and enthralling. The journey the characters take is at times a bit confusing and convulsive but it is beautiful and visually exciting. The music in Dune adds to the epic feeling that the movie gives, and engrosses you in its wonderful and emotionally thrilling score.

363,ReelLover,Better than you think.,8,19 October 2021,"The criticisms of this Dune seem to be hinged on the approval of what was once a huge fan base, that was critical of anything relating to the Dune universe. Since much of that base has been fed several different versions of the same story, with varying degrees of approval, I think the cult status of both the books and this adaptation cannot be understated and this is still the version I personally judge all others by.In 1984 I went in blind to the Dune saga depite having tried to read the books, with it's heavy jargon and plethora of characters I was lost by page 10, but knowing Lynch from Eraserhead and The Elephant Man, I felt I was in good hands when I finally sat through my first screening of his version. What makes me like this most of all is that unlike the future versions that manifested, David Lynch took a huge risk making it his own and the fact each subsequent version seems to carrry the torch of ""This is not THAT Dune"", speaks volumes regarding the impact Lynch made on the Dune Universe, and it's also a glaring example of the ignorance of those filmmakers to what Lynch's Dune was all about, of which is, a LOVE STORY!Lynch knew he could never match the varied and complex Dune universe in one film, plus needing a common thread to pull in new fans was a difficult task that has likely haunted him ever since he had his name taken off of the extended version which seems to be a fan favorite for the Dune geeks who likely have no relationships to speak of. So trying to wrap their singular brains around the real story being told is likely met with bitterness and contempt, and I believe that is why this version is loathed so much.If you take away the expectations and preconceptions projected onto this film, it is about a man coming of age after losing his father and his father's legacy, to be cast away among a group of mongrels who eventually connect him to his true destiny and the love of his life. The subtle beauty of the love between Ciani and Paul still sometimes takes my breath away, and the underlying themes of courage, devotion and enlightenment are never more present, or memorable, than in David Lynch's Dune.On a production level, Dune is full of unforgettable sets and makeup effects, orchestrated by the loving hand of the director in a symphony of sites that, to my mind, spawned the steampunk and cyberpunk movements.The music by Toto is also unforgettable, and sadly, to my knowledge, the only film they scored.Everything about Lynch's Dune is really unforgettable, but because he focused on making a love story for geeks who live in their parents basement, he encountered a resistance that sadly endures.If you want Dune, it's obvious you need to read the books. If you want a love story, watch this film.",Dune

They became truly iconic; the concept, established. The Spice was stolen from Asimov like much else in the 60s; there's some attempt at politics but it never takes off beyond quarreling families, medieval style.After Star Trek made the movies (also without knowledge in the field) and the partially mature/partially childish Space Fantasy of Star Wars, this movie came at exactly the wrong time (and, essentially over a decade too late).A few memorable scenes, but you will want to know that you want to watch this to have the patience to stay for the duration.

There are a couple of sequences from the Alan Smithee bootleg version - such as when the water of the Fremen warrior that Paul defeated in combat is re-absorbed into the collective water supply - that are absolutely vital to the story.

He wrote, ""This movie is a real mess its an incomprehensible, unstructured, ugly pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time."" It is a certainly strange movie. It is kind of like David Lynch wanted to combine the religious and political overtones of the film with the style of his Eraserhead. The result is it is sometimes confusing. The f/x now looks dated in many sequences although many still hold up well. The film is well-cast with actors like Kyle Machlachlan, Patrick Stewart, Max Von Sydow, and many others. They all give strong performances. Its certainly is a fascinating mess. Utterly min-boggling at times although not as difficult to follow as others have claimed. Still this is not one of Lynch's best efforts. It deserves it cult following, but will always polarize fans of the book. Watch and see where you stand. This is ultimately a love-it or hate-it affair. See it, and you will know where you stand.",Dune
371,mugwug,Lynch's Dune is unique and beautiful,8,25 February 2005,"I think this version of Dune is amazing. The sets, costumes and actors are all great. The look of the Harkonnen planet is superb and the Baron is both grotesque and terrifying.I truly love the little Guild guys in the black leather coats with the tubes coming out their heads and into their nose. The translator they used to speak to the Emperor was genius.I love the scene where Rabban rips a piece off the cow and chews it while the Baron instructs him to squeeze the life out of the Fremen and how Raban knocks down one of the little guys who is slaughtering the cow. And also the look of glee on the face of Jack Nance as he is controlling the device that allows the Baron to circle the 'steam patio' and screaming and gloating about defeating the Atredies.I've never seen a sci-fi film that had such an amazing look to it. The Reverend Mother Gaius is such a wickedly evil villain.Granted, some of the effects were crude and look very dated now but I'd rather watch Dune 10 times rather than have to sit thru Episode One or any other popular sci-fi film.David Lynch is a true artist and this film is an example how he can create something visually stunning when faced with so many obstacles.Also, Lynch's version of Dune make the sci-fi channel's mini-series look like a high school production.",Dune

Even the Dune fan will find this an improvement over the original movie - even though there are some minor negative points. It adds some 50 minutes to the movie and takes away some 5 minutes. After seeing it, I think it is a definite improvement.Good points - Prologue explains a little bit of the background - Some of the more distastefull scenes have disappeared (fi. the vampire like scene with baron Harkonnen) - The plot within plot is much more visible and the visionary details are more explained - We hear Gurney play! - The water ritual of the fremen is much more explainedNegative points - Prologue is a definite aftertought - Good, but not in style with the movie - timeline within the movie is still wrong - Sound and music are not as good as the movie version - I prefer princess Irulan as the voice over - especially since she is the historian in the later books. - The ending is still not true to the bookAll in all - this is a very difficult book to film, I think this TV version of David Lynch's film is a reasonable effort.I admit I am hoping the new TV series will be more true to the book, but it will be a challenge to be better.",Dune

Every set, every costume, every prop -is a brilliant and unique work of art. The whole movie is enveloped with a sort of dark, nightmare-ish atmosphere that I find very appealing. It is indeed unfortunate that David Lynch's interpretation of the novel is so widely misunderstood; it is my opinion, however, that most movies that are truly worth watching, are not the kind that appeal to mass audiences anyhow.",Dune

The use of inner thought monologues are a lazy way to adapt a book and are often so on the nose with explaining the story/world.However, these monologues give key context to the story and world of Dune and the 2021 film has none of this and as a result does not provide a lot of context for what is going on. I have not read the book and will get around to it one day, but you shouldn't have to in order to appreciate a film, it should be able to stand on its own. And though flawed, the Lynch film does tell the story better and provides a lot more details albeit clumsily. The characters are also given more depth and the Harkonnen's are way more threatening and frightening in this one.If anything, if you haven't read the book, watch this one to give yourself context for the 2021 film.

Theatergoers started laughing at the disjointed script, the childish high school level screenplay, the horrible edit, the heavily influenced Florence era Italian art direction and set design, the rubber rocks, cheesy special effects, the Flash Gordon rocket ships with sparkies and all those horrible voiceovers... yikes! Yes it had its moments, and even though we desperately tried to maintain our composure as long as we could, we soon found ourselves joining in the fun of laughing at every scene as some in the theater would voice new dialog at the screen in response to it. I guess it was a way for the crowd to voice their collective dissapointment at David's directorial mess of a book they held so dear, we turned it into a comedy free-for-all.",Dune
380,pianotm-58404,"My rating is for the Special Edition, which absolutely everyone should see.",8,4 September 2019,"I first watched Dune when I was 12 years old, back in 1992, at a time when the Special Edition didn't exist, and I fell in love with it. I had rented this movie, and had never owned it. I wouldn't see it again until 2001, and it would be a different version, the Special Edition, on the Disney Channel of all places. It took until 2010 for me to finally see the original 1984 version again and clearly see that it was a terrible, incoherent mess of a movie. Obviously, at this point, you should immediately be concluding that the Special Edition is far superior, and yeah, it is.The original 1984 version was a pared down mess. What happened was simple. Dino de Laurentiis had a standard contract with his directors that no film could be longer than 90 minutes. David Lynch, the director, had a bit of a problem of his own. He'd only worked on indie productions previously, and there was no way that the story told in the book could be told in 90 minutes. He wanted three hours. Given that the 1984 version is 96 minutes long, it should be clear who won this disagreement. The visuals are stunning, the world is deeply immersive and the characters are compelling, but there is no linear sense to the story. Much of the context is destroyed by successive cuts in an effort to turn a three hour movie into a 90 minute movie. Many plot threads are never resolved and many story paths are presented with no explanation for how we got from point A to point B. The result is a movie that literally looks like a someone's-favorite-scenes-smash-cut that you might see on Youtube. The charm is there, to be certain. You can get the overall jist of the story and certain story threads are completely followed (they can't sanely destroy all of the film's context, after all! You wouldn't know what the hell you were looking at.), but all of the subtlety and nuance in the film is gone to the extent that you simply don't understand it unless you've read the books, and no movie should ever be made like that. Lynch's biggest complaint wasn't studio interference, but that he didn't feel he had the experience to make a real big-budget sci-fi movie, which, I mean, the effects aren't the greatest, but the visuals are stunning. I think he's really underrating what he accomplished with this movie, at least visually. It truly looks the world you imagine from the books, and that's not really something you can say about a lot of movies.Several attempts have been made to improve the film, to the point that David Lynch disowned the movie, giving us one of the rare Alan Smithee films that's actually really freaking good. That version is Dune: Special Edition. Deleted scenes are reinserted and a few scenes are replaced. The Special Edition of Dune is the best version of any version, including the amazing Sci-Fi (No, it was not called Syfy at that point.) Channel TV mini-series. Yes, I know the mini-series follows the book a lot more closely (and lets be honest, they still take a lot of unfortunate liberties). I know that what we ended up with was farther from Lynch's original vision than the theatrical version had been, but he filmed these scenes, and put in the movie, this Special Edition tells the version of Dune that we always deserved. I think my only complaint with this is that the Irulan opening from the original version is eschewed for the story-teller opening that was originally rejected. I love seeing all the paintings that told the story, but the Irulan opening was such a dynamic visual and compelling narration device that it seems criminal to cut it, but they did, and it's not in what is clearly the superior version. I understand why the Special Edition went with the opening it chose, because it had more lore and world building, but I honestly don't think any of that helped the movie. I definitely would have preferred the opening Irulan narration, and that would have fit better with the lore, because the story in the first book, Dune, is ostensibly being told by Irulan (that's the lore of the book: you're reading her biography of Muad'dib.).The original 1984, version, as I said earlier, introduces plot threads and then inexplicably abandons them in favor of run time. The Special Edition fixes this by restoring deleted scenes that tied everything up. It also adds deleted scenes that helps develop the aura of Muad'dib the prophet. In short, the theatrical version is a mess, and the Special Edition is nothing short of a masterpiece.",Dune

There are mixtures of acting both terrible and transcendent, some odd casting choices, confusing transitions, and continuity problems, but stylistically it's gorgeous. Some of the book's themes survived the transition to the screen, which is why I rated it a seven. There are some really awkward scenes that don't work: any of Alia's obviously dubbed voiceovers, intended to make her more creepy but coming off as cartoonish, the duke's death scene (""...refuse...""), Dr. Yueh's comically overdone reaction when he thinks his wife is still alive (it was so dramatic in the book, so disappointing in the film), Paul's dream sequences (""...desert planet...""), princess Irulan's disembodied head introduction (why?), and the disappointingly few scenes with Shadout Mapes before she's quickly killed. On the other hand, Brad Dourif nailed all of his scenes, as he does in every role, and you couldn't find a better Baron than Kenneth McMillan, or a better emperor than Jose Ferrer.

Just before I borrowed a videotape, I tried to stalk some reminiscences. Nothing. Chaos. Dark scenes, worms, desert...that is all I remembered. So I looked at Dune once again. It was ... well, it wasn't very nice experience. Science fiction is funny genre. Story must be rigid, it has to have steady growth, it has to describe a world beyond the one we see in reality, and that has to be done in a very persuasive way. It is also a genre of picturing, especially of showing how things are different from what we are use to. It has to be pure fantasy and when seeing it one has to flow within, one has to emerge in that fantasy completely. No interruptions.I would like to say that Dune has any of such qualities. But it hasn't. That's a shame. I have a feeling, that there was no such wish, that Dune should be one of those very compelling sci-fi movies: Fifth element or Blade Runner. It is done over a very classical science fiction novel by F. Herbert, yes, but under circumstances of Lynch direction it is practically nothing more than vague.

I can't help mentioning Sting as well, even though I prefer him as an artist.Another thing I loved about this film was the stunningly beautiful music. Especially I liked the piece that was played during the end credits.The movie itself had a good plot (I must remind you I haven't read the book so I don't know whether the movie was anything even close to the book??).

I was a bit confused in the beginning of the film though, the Emperor had a strange guest, I can't remember what the thing was called or what its purpose was... if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about (the pink creature...??).Anyway, I REALLY recommend this film to everyone, it's really a pleasure to watch!",Dune

That was the question I asked myself when I had to make a comparison between the book and the movie in an english course (I'm french, as you can see from my poor english).In the book, Paul knows pretty well he's going to launch the Jihad, millions of crazy warriors willing to destroy the known universe, get their payback for their centuries of wandering in the galaxy as the Zensunni. But he decides to do so, to get his own revenge from the Harkonnens; he deliberately chooses to be their messiah, using the missionaria protective, fooling them (a very important scene is the one where Paul meets Gurney Halleck again; he kills one man with his knife, and he imagines the legends that will be held that he had killed 40 or so with bare hands). Herbert gives us a user's guide on ""How to become a messiah"".What? But messias are not built, they are born half god, half human; it just can't pass through on the screen in a mainstream american movie. So after all, Paul does not fool them, he's the messiah; the fremens are not blood-thirsty warriors, killing with knives and whatever they can grab, using their children as shields, they kill with clean ""sound weapons""; Harkonnens are more evil than ever, and stupid too (which is not the case in the book; they're cruel, brutal, but not stupid). And after having killed Feyd-Rautha, with his fur coat, Paul is just like a Christ who saved the galaxy from tyranny. This is a dramatic shortening of Herbert's views and ideas. Only remains Lynch visual talent, Toto's score and Sting's very good (though short) performance as Feyd-Rautha.",Dune
398,reedmilder,Abomination!!!,4,25 June 2002,"Those who are familiar with the novels depicting the world of Dune know how central abomination is to the story.  This film is a perfect characterization of the word.  It is OK for a film to merely skim or even alter the book version.  It is almost impossible to adequately represent the depth of a novel on film.  However, if a director chooses to betray the source of the film he should at least make it entertaining.  This film is largely a borefest, and I would imagine is unintelligible to anyone who hasn't read the book.  This film is campy, unimaginative, and full of characters that have nothing important to add to the story.Skip this movie and read the book if you really want to be entertained. After you read the book, watch the more recent TV miniseries version which is far superior to this piece of garbage.  I have enjoyed much of Lynch's work, especially ""Blue Velvet"".  This is not one of his better outputs. Don't waste your time.",Dune
399,jeeves-1,On its own merits...,10,23 September 2002,"I have one piece of advice for anyone who wants to see this movie: read the book first.  Then, my second piece of advice is: after you have read the book, don't compare the movie to the book.  Let the movie stand on its own merits.  This movie, at time, a great many times in fact, asks a lot of the view.  Moreover, it makes a number of assumptions of the viewer.  I watched the movie several times before I read the book and found that I enjoyed both more once I enjoyed both several times.  The movie does leave a lot out, but, the movie doesn't ask the viewer to really understand and fully grasp the story the way Mr. Herbert wrote it.Speaking only of the visuals, this movie is incredible.  The sets, costumes, the cinematography etc. where top notch for the day.  Even today, much of this original movie could not be improved upon by the newest version produced for the SciFi Channel.  Not fully knowing how to express it, I will only say that in comparison to the new version, this Lynch version seems more real, more tangible than the SciFi version.Despite its shortcomings in comparison to the book, this movie remains one of my favorite movies of all time.  To enjoy it you have to take what is given.",Dune
400,cosmo111687,Beautiful Direction ruined by a Poor Story,5,21 November 2007,"I did think that David Lynch's visualization of the story was very beautifully done (especially when compared to the later, made for TV version). He manages to bring the viewer into any story directly through the senses, as though guiding you through a dream (albeit, a rather strange and bizarre one).The story, however, is really just awful. Now, I haven't read the book, so it's possible that Dune, the novel, is much more thought provoking than the movie was. But it seems to me that the only ascertainable morals that can be drawn from the story are that leaders can justify their violent actions by calling themselves messiahs and the universe can be divided between the good and the evil; the good are young and handsome and the evil are often ugly and wear a lot of black. That sort of moralizing, which serves as the structure of the story, I just find intolerable. And if that structure seems rotten to me already, than little anything else that stems from it can impress me very much.David Lynch's direction gives this movie a lot of spice, but nothing can bring life to this barren wasteland.",Dune
401,mafox,Well Sir...I don't like it.,3,13 September 2003,"Frank Herbert's book is a classic, an epic, a book that anyone who appreciates good literature should read.  A wonderfully detailed and intricate setting combined with fascinating characters and ironic relationships make a feast for the mind.  If you can read (seems like you should be able to) and haven't already done so, go to a used book store, pick up a copy of Dune, and start reading.With such a rich story to draw upon, I was looking forward to watching Lynch's adaptation of Dune after finishing the book.  Oh man, was I disappointed, even more so than when I walked out of The Hulk.  I'm not kidding, it's that bad.It seems like the script writer had his eight-year old daughter read the book, had her explain it to his 80-ish father, and then listened to grandpa's summary as inspiration.  Then Lynch threw in some neato sound-based ""weirding module"" weapons, made the Baron stupid and able to fly, cast a rock-star to get butts in the seats, and added plenty of cheesy eighties-style guitar to make audiences in the next millennium wince.The worms are cool, but for some reason the movie's portrayal reminded me of cows.  (Weird!)  The space scenes are unique, but totally unimportant. There are some sparsely sown tiny nuggets of good acting, but mostly the actors seem as confused as the audience.    The costumes are simply amazing. Really well done.  The sets are also very nice, especially the Imperial halls.  If you like cool worms, unique space scenes, sparse and tiny acting nuggets, amazing costumes, nice sets, but don't give a hoot about anything else, go see this movie right now!I don't know if a film adaptation of Dune could ever do the book justice. Perhaps, but it's obviously really really hard to pack so much into a two-ish hour film.  (We are talking about Lynch after all.  He was anything but a hack.)  I'm hoping that the SCI FI channel's mini-series is better.",Dune

The next struggle between human Race will be for PSYCHIC POWERS like TELEPATHY, CLAIRVOYANCE, CLAIR-AUDIENCE, REGRESSION THROUGH THE TIME etc. And as the Scientist says the Universe is made of Dark particle and dark energy and It is always expanding, It is also possible that in time period which has been shown in the film (100th Century) there will be many planets on the Universe where there will be life. And The war and conflicts will be not between the countries anymore but between the planets. As Vedas explains the 'KALYUG"" has just began, It verifies the major dramatic changes in the Universe is yet to happen. I am just wondering the Future of earth is going to be ruled by Mayans, Egyptians, Indians and other civilizations who still believes and do the mystical practices to develop the consciousness and it's infinite powers.

404,HHoffman-2,An excellent adaptation of Frank Herbert's literary epic.,8,13 September 2006,"Dune is a film that largely divides fans when regarding its level of quality. Regardless of one's personal views on David Lynch's adaptation, most will agree that the director managed to capture the atmosphere that Frank Herbert created. Is the film perfect? No, of course not. Is it a good example of SF as presented through cinema? Definitely.Story: The story tells of a feud between two noble families, Atreides and Harkonnen. But this description only scratches the surface. Betrayal, prophecy, love, and spiritual calling also run prevalent.David Lynch penned the screenplay and should be commended for his fidelity to the source material. Dune is one of the few films (especially at the time of its release) to be a faithful adaptation of its literary counterpart.That's not to say that there aren't minor alterations made here and there. But most of these changes shouldn't offend the hard-core fans, as some of them (particularly the ending) improve the narrative direction of the film.Acting: Dune boasts an excellent ensemble cast. Kyle MacLachlan stars as Paul Atreides, the boy fated to be a messiah of the planet Arrakis. He does a good job in showing a growth in maturity as he grows closer to fulfilling his destiny. His sullen expressions truly capture the character's burden of an unknown future.Kenneth McMillan portrays the vile Baron Harkonnen and plays the role up very well. McMillan also shows the audience the power of minimalistic acting, as evidenced by some of the character's subtle homosexual tendencies.Other notable actors that stand out in the film are Patrick Stewart, Sean Young, and Jürgen Prochnow. To say that these are the only ones worth noting, however, would be a crime. Dune features one of the greatest casts I've ever seen.Visual/Special Effects: As previously stated, most fans will admit that the visuals are very true to Frank Herbert's vision. From the set design to the spice-drugged eyes to the sand worms, the production costs really reflect the ambition this film carried.David Lynch, known for his independent film Eraserhead, continues to impress us with the bizarre imagery that runs prevalent in his films. Dune is no exception. Paul Atreides' spice-induced dreams definitely have psychedelic overtones.Carlo Rambaldi, who designed the creature effects, did a reasonable job on the sand worms. But, like many films of this genre, they have become dated. Nevertheless, they were impressive for 1984 and should be appreciated for what they were.Musical Score: I found this aspect of the film to be rather disappointing. The Prophecy theme, while powerful and mysterious, is used one too many times. Toto's score also has moments featuring an electric guitar, which totally destroys the illusion of being in another time and place. A film score must compliment the film, not detract from it. Thankfully, these moments are few.Conclusion: Dune is a fine example of science fiction cinema. While David Lynch didn't have the amount of creative control he desired, the final product is nothing to complain about. The fact that Frank Herbert was pleased with this production is a testament to its quality.On a more informal note: when viewing this for the first time, always be sure to watch the theatrical version. The extended cut is a convoluted mess that should only be seen for the knowledge of how horribly studio executives can tamper with a film.",Dune
405,xiaoweibond,American science fiction by Italian director,8,21 November 2003,"This movie failed at the box office because it required a level of mental reflection not avaialable in 1984 or now.The acting ability of McLaughlin as the hero contributed nothing to the overall impact of the movie. Other actors including the father (Captain:Das Boot) succeeded in pushing the story along. The magnificent sets and customes were straight from Russian pre-revolution palaces. Anyone studying movies  needs to see this movie to see some of the techniques employed. The Italian Director: De Laurentis died during the filming which may explain the underlying sombre atmosphere of the film. The story is strong and logical but low on gratuitous special effects (except for the flying worms) unlike that humourless monochrome MATRIX kids stuff. Pity that this movie like ANDROID has never been given a chance. Hollywood never subscribes to European artistic creativity, as in ""Once upon a time in the West"": Probably the most entertaining western ever made. Excuse the digression.",Dune
406,WatchingInDarkness,The movie resembles your best friend who happens to be an addict,9,19 February 2021,"Perhaps a necessary comparison due to the plot centering on addiction, but this movie has long since been acclaimed and despised equally, but is unquestionably a classic.Sets are surprisingly Jules Verne-esque, especially considering the techno-obsessed 80's, but it worked to effect the most important thing of all, to move the viewer into alternate universe wholly. It avoided the cheesy mylar and rayon pseudo futuristic sets and costumes of Star Trek and other mid-century sci-fi greats.The cult of Dune was upset with the final product, as even the director was, but for the starving out here, we ate up the epic story, told well enough, if not perfectly.I watched the story many times over the years, and it still works.The remake due out later this year is welcome, but nothing will take the shine off this old standard. It is a welcome romp through excess, funk, evil, hope, and fantasy. Thank you, Mr. Herbert.True fact, Frank Herbert was my landlord a few years back. Ok, so it wasn't THAT Frank Herbert . . .",Dune
407,earnes,One of the few movies with a style of its own,8,14 December 2005,"Seriously, I do not understand why so many people dislike this movie. I think you have to take a couple of things into account. First: It is a 2 hour movie telling a story that spans several hundred pages in a book - so certain losses are just natural. Second: Compared to three times recycled multi-million-dollar-trash like the new Star Wars Episodes, this movie offers something really unique: A style of its own. The mixture between scifi elements, medieval setting and the culture of the the Middle East is excellent and Lynch welded them together into one solid piece of art... even though he seems to disagree today. Within this setting the lack of non-stop-action or overwhelming SFX never bothered me. On the contrary, this movie gives you time to watch... and many scenes are worth a second look. Third: I loved the actors, who were just as stiff, ugly, arrogant, noble or nice like the characters they tried to represent.In the end it is a question of taste if you like this movie or not.

Those who liked the book will love the longer version better than the initial release, even if Lynch didn't want to be associated with it. It has a wonderful cast of actors who despite short screen time convey powerful personalities. The enigmatic prophecy theme is captivating and the music for it is truly inspired.

I am staggered at the wooden acting bearing in mind the high credibility of some of the cast. The story line jumpy and unclear, a mishmash of to-ing and fro-ing. The lighting and cinematography were dreadful in more than half of it. The script sounded so contrived that it could so easily be mistaken for a spoof.One has to be a seriously devoted and forgiving fan of this title to appreciate it in any form at all.

Read the first three books, then see the film.",9,21 January 2017,"Having read the first three books before I saw the film (at its original release), I was incredibly impressed with what had been achieved within the time-frame of the movie. It is an elaborate, well-staged and acted precis - mainly of book one and ending with the close of book three. I have the Blu-ray release, and watch it annually (roughly speaking). Without familiarity with the books, I don't understand how anyone could make sense of the film, but clearly, many have.I guess it's a failure, a failure because it demands close attention (and audiences have had increasingly shorter attention spans as time has gone on), and because it grabs bits of the books without being really able to achieve a smoothly flowing story-line. But this is because the stories are so detailed, extensive and complex, that it is virtually impossible to encompass the material in one movie. Here, the virtually impossible came closer to being achieved than I would have believed possible. On that, I see it as a minor masterpiece, but only as a supplement to, at least, the first book. Buy the book then don't miss his movie. In this context it is a remarkable achievement.",Dune

The other big flaw is that only the events of part 1 of the book are described fully; part 2 simply disappears and part 3 goes far too fast. So, we get a great introduction but a very unsatisfactory development of characters and events. The development of Paul's character from a Duke's heir to Muab'dib, which is a key element in the novel, is left unexplained in this film.Having said this, the visuals are stunning, the casting and acting is almost perfect, the music goes very well with the story and the way to bring to the screen so many internal thoughts as they appear in the novel is well solved.I remember loving the film the first time I saw it, but having seen it repeatedly while re-reading the novel leaves me unsatisfied because so many things are left out.With more money and time this would have been a 10 and a perfect adaptation of a great novel.",Dune

This film, unlike the more recent TV version, does a good job, but lacks the ingenuity I'd like to see in a Herbert movie.I had always hoped that Stanley Kubrick would've undertaken one of Herbert's books; but alas he never did.  Perhaps Peter Jackson will some day; I've been impressed with his TLOR transformation from book to film.  You always loose something, yet PJ did the book justice (at least so far).

I didn't mind any of the changes. Weirding modules were one of my favorite parts. Yes. It rains at the end. It's not like they knew if another would be made. Diehard fans are silly in my opinion.

The books are my favourite science fiction books and I feel on a level with the Lord of the rings when it comes to literature.I know it changes quite a few things and leaves quite a few important things out. However despite all this I feel this is a truly great movie and though not completely accurate it catches the spirit of the novel.I have seen the television series made later and though that is more accurate to the book I feel it does not at all capture the spirit.this movie captures that spirit and the epic scale of the book and also far more importantly the spirituality. I would take the movie over the series any day.Whether a fan or not it is worth watching this movie. For those who have never read the Dune books or know much about them you will find this a wonderful piece of cinematography from the 1980's that was groundbreaking for it's time and may bring you interest in the novels. For those fans who have never seen it you will find an interesting take and I hope like me look fast the flaws in the story-line to see how the spirit of the novel was captured.I saw this movie when I was just 7 back in 1984 and I have been fascinated by it since, even back in those times when I could not understand it at such a young age it enthralled me and it was certainly due to the movie that later on in adulthood I went on to read the novels and to this date I have read every one by Frank Herbert and by his son.",Dune

Little good this did me in the dark.  When movies use terms that the average viewer wouldn't know, they usually use subtitles.  This is the only exam - I mean  movie -  I've ever attended where I was given a crib sheet.The movie itself had some pageantry, but most of this was lost on not being completely sure what was going on and what was being said. And - Curse the darkness! - I just couldn't find all the secret code words on my sheet. Also, my attention was often diverted by the parade of moviegoers packing in their popcorn and making a quick exit.And even what action I could follow was ruined by the nagging feeling that I was missing something.Friends and family who were fans of the trilogy generally enjoyed the movie. But a movie is its own medium.  It shouldn't take the preparation of three novels to enjoy it.I think Dune stands as an example of how not to make a movie.

429,trekker42,Poor adaptation of a superb novel,1,9 September 2001,"For those of you who have perhaps read Frank Herbert's original Dune, and are considering viewing this movie, here's some advice: don't.  Swish orange juice, toothpaste, and clam chowder in your mouth: you'll get the same effect.Herbert wrote an epic masterpiece that should be regarded as the Hamlet of science fiction (actually, it is very vaguely adapted from Hamlet).  David Lynch scripted and directed a butchery of this novel.  He made so many mistakes, it is impossible to cover them all.  Here's a general idea: the novel is summarized, not adapted.  The movie contains about half of the elements involved in the story, and watching it makes you feel like you're falling asleep and missing half the plot.  Everybody in the story has an agenda, but you get to see only half of these agendas, and are left to imagine the others.  Character development was mediocre, and paled in comparison to the rich depth given in the novel.  The writers obviously did not understand Herbert's technologies, because the movie displayed loads of horse dung where there should have been intricacies that would say, ""Star Wars, eat your heart out.""  There was poor acting from everybody but Jurgen Prochnow as Leto, Patrick Stewart as Halleck, and Sting as Rautha.  And finally, the special effects of the time simply weren't up to snuff for Herbert's vision.  From the blue eyes to the force fields, everything looked horribly cheesy.  If the folks had waited a decade, or maybe used something better than a third-grader's sketch pad, then they would have had stunning visual effects.Overall, what we are left with here is a definitive flop.  I can only hope that the TV miniseries version that aired last year did a better job.  On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is somewhere around absolute zero (-273.15, FYI).",Dune

It's almost impossible to make in to a miniseries (they tried). To try making it into a 2 hour movie could just mean a disaster. The main problem of the movie is it just doesn't tell the story well. And it can't. Not in 2 hours! But it tries, and that is the main problem, and that is why I won't even go into the plot. I read most of the Dune books, and that movie just doesn't make sense of it. If you see it before you read the book you will know nothing, if you see it after your read the book you just can't like it. I personally love Lynch's films ""Eraserhead"", ""Blue Velvet"", even ""The Straight story"", but to make such movie as Dune in the 80 is like trying to blend together Godzilla and Roland Emmerich a decade later, it just doesn't work. But there is no doubt we should appreciate the effort (in both cases). The cast was exceptional, but all these stars had limited screen time. Sean Young, Patrick Stewart, Jurgen Prochnow, Virginia Madsen, Kenneth McMillan, Linda Hunt, the beautiful Francesca Annis, even Sting and Max von Sydow. With these people around the then young Kyle MacLachlan, who shined late in ""Twin Peaks"", just couldn't make Paul Atreides interesting. The other problem is the inner monologue, it is just too distracting. Third the special effect, after Alien and Star Wars were laughable. The redeeming quality are the sets, they make the movie sticks with you. It's a movie that you remember even if you try to forget it. For movie lovers it's a movie like Blade Runner, a movie of the edge, but it didn't age as well as Scott's masterpiece did. I saw the theatrical version of Dune on DVD, beautifully restored, but I would love to see the rumored Lynch's 4 hour cut. For general audiences it's just too bizarre and complicated. For film buffs it's not rewarding enough. It's no high cinema, it's no trash, it's no product of the 80-s like ""Red Sonya"" or ""They Live"" it's a movie that I fear will never find a place because it was not taken to the end. Should you see it? Yes. Will you like it? Probably not. There might be a formula to see it, at least for the people who read the book, try to forget that it is Dune, you might appreciate it more.",Dune

433,pronkyou,Long live the Fighters!!,10,6 July 2003,"A masterpiece that has enthralled audiences for generations, the novel Dune is in my opinion one of the greatest novels ever written.  It will immerse you in a universe based on humanity, yet so far distant from our present and so detailed in culture and language, that you would believe Frank Herbert to be from the worlds of Dune himself.  In working with David Lynch, he has brought his imagination to the screen.  I had to watch the movie 7 times before I understood everything.  A movie like this captures the imagination of even those who do not like science fiction and pulls them to a place of beauty, horror, prophecy, religious zeal, political intrigue, power, and destiny.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.",Dune

435,kybo_king7,The worst movie ever made.,1,14 September 2003,"Before I saw this ""film"" I thought that it couldn't possibly be as bad as I had heard.  After all, the book is one of the best science fiction novels ever written. However, now that I have, I think it is a vast understatement to call it bad.  This horrid piece of cinematic garbage is the absolute worst pile of crap ever caught on camera.  Every aspect of this worthless piece of filth is awful beyond all description.  The director must have had his head turned the other way with his eyes closed and his ears plugged, because everything the ""actors"" do is either way over the top or bland beyond all hope of recovery.  In fact, the only decent actor I saw in this movie was Patrick Stewart, and he's obviously trying to work with what he has.  Unfortunately, what he has is absolutely nothing.  Not only that, but he is miscasted and underplayed.How could anyone get this story so wrong?!?  The acting is wretched.  The cinematography is bland and uninteresting.  The special effects are cheesy, thrown together, and annoying.  Whoever made the soundtrack was obviously trying to put the audience to sleep.  The lighting is dull and the costumes and makeup are stupid.  There is not a single thing that is good about this movie.  I got up in the middle of it and went to watch my little brother play computer games because it interested me more than watching this pathetic excuse of a movie.  And what the hell is the point of the princess fading in and out at the beginning?!?    Is anyone actually interested in what she has to say?  All she does is explain crap that could be figured out by watching the rest of the movie! Speaking of which, I noticed that unless you've read the book, this movie is completely incomprehensible.  And if you have read the book, you realize what a stinking pile of crap it really is.  My humble opinion is that everyone involved with this utter waste of time, energy, and resources needs to be rounded up, tortured, and shot. Dune is the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE.  EVER.",Dune

It also cleared up several issues of the Fremen. Cause of the vendetta between Harkonen and Atredies, how the Space Guild was developed. Would anyone please respond to this?

The voice-over, while irritating at moments, adds to the strangeness and unfamiliarity of the picture on the whole. I loved the actors and acting, especially Kyle MacLachlan as Paul, and his journey from an innocent lad to a man. What has failed? The ambition of the director proved to be too big for creation of such work at this time of cinematography. It could have been made more cohesive, as without having read the book, the viewers fail to understand many things in the film. Lynch wanted to tell too much at times, which resulted in quirky cuts and jumps, and some things are just stated or mentioned without explanation. The special effects are dated and some of them look quite funny today. But on the whole: a compelling work of art. One of the strangest films I have ever seen. It definitely deserves attention. P.S. I haven't read the book.",Dune
438,remy-24,"Dated fx, but still a great story and nicely executed movie",7,14 June 2005,"Dune. At first, I only knew it from the games. Then I found out there were books, and after that, there was a movie. I'm talking 2000 here, and I've only just recently seen it. More than 20 years after the movie was made, and seeing it in this era of very cunning special fx and 3D does make it look dated a bit. Is that necessarily a bad thing? No. The movie is pretty good actually. But the problem with it is, that you can't tell the whole Dune-story in just one movie: it should have been a two or even three-piece like LOTR. People completely unfamiliar with the Dune-story and world will ask themselves after viewing it: 'what the hell was that all about?' while I myself say: 'that was quite nice actually'. The budget was no less than 40 million dollars, huge huge for 1984. And it shows: the costumes, ships, decors and worm-fx are great. If it would be made in this year, it would probably be brilliant. In 1984 it was a bit limited because of technological limits, not creative ones.Yes, I liked it, and once more added a new dimension of understanding for me to the story of Dune.

439,seanrforeman,Decent translation of a masterpiece,7,27 March 2008,"Dune is one of those movies that you both love and hate.Many people, including myself, feel the novel is a masterpiece. Any attempt to squeeze this complex story into two hours is going to have its faults. The movie does a decent job of compressing the story. It focuses on the main character and gives time to many of the subplots. It does a superior job of showing both the inquisitive and cunning nature of Paul. The miniseries makes Paul look like a whiny Luke Skywalker.I am especially impressed with several of the scenes that seem to be almost word for word from the book, including the inner dialog.Unfortunately, its Lynch grotesqueness distracts from the plot. I first saw this movie before reading the book and the disgusting Harkonnen scenes really made me think the book must suck. It was only later I was to discover this was the invention of Lynch.Another fault is that both the miniseries and the movie paint the Harkonnens as a stupid arch enemies. Nothing could be further from the truth. The intelligence and scheming of the Baron is what makes this novel brilliant. (In future movie attempts, I'd prefer a skinny smart Baron to a Fat Oaf.) Overall, this is a good adaptation. I love the by-the-book scenes and hate the Lynch bits. If you ignore the Lynch parts, it is quite enjoyable.",Dune
440,batman1891,This movie sucked,1,21 February 2005,"I can't believe anyone would think the Lynch version was better or even close to Herbert's masterpiece. I read the book and then watched the Lynch version the day after finishing the book and was horrified.The only thing that the book stayed true to were the character names and that people wanted spice, for Christs sakes the weirding way got transformed from a martial arts movements to some sort of gun fighting. This is only one instance, I could write a novel with all the discrepancies, OH WAIT there is a novel with all the discrepancies it is titled ""Dune"" by Frank Herbert. What about the lavishness of the novel, how in depth the story went and then to get this cut and dry movie that is hard to follow (even after reading the book) which just completely changes the characters moods and motives and AHHHH, just extremely frustrated by this whole movie.Then there is the Sci-Fi Channel's version, in honesty not great acting, sets, or costumes, but this is a cable channels mini-series version, NOT A MAJOR STUDIO PRODUCTION, don't expect to get those great ascetics you seem to complain about. The story is what matters and the mini-series is about as close to the novel as you can expect. Characters stay true to there portrayal in the novel and *I know this is a lot to expect from a movie adapted from a novel* the story is the same in the subtitles and the major plots.But if you have not read the book(s) then this movie will probably be enjoyable, as is evident in the fact anyone who has not read the books does enjoy the Lynch version, and truly the visual effects of this movie were extremely advanced for the time.But to you who have read the book and found a story with a scope far beyond your average novel/story/epic you will be sorely disappointed. *****NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT***** If you have read all books - Dune, Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emporor Dune, Heretics of Dune, Chapter House Dune, House Atreides, House Harkonen, House Corrino, Bulterian Jihad, Machine Crusade, and the most recent Battle of Corrin do not AND I REPEAT DO NOT watch this film, it is heresy and insulting to say the least, and only a true fan can truly realize this.",Dune
441,cmatsoukis-50941,Bad but not the worst,5,22 June 2018,"I am writing this review after listening to the book on Audible. I am also writing this review in 2018. I am taking two things into account, the length of the movie and the time it was made. When I watch a movie based off of a book, I know that it is impossible to get everything into it. This movie is basically an abridged audio book (meaning it cut out the fat and leaves only the necessity). I watched the movie with my father and wife who did not read the book. What they took out of the movie was good. I told them some more information about certain scenes For example, when Paul told Kynes that he adjusted the stillsuit properly. In this movie Kynes noted this but if you didn't read the book, you would not know that this is significant because the messiah will know the way of the Fremen. Another example I had to provide more information for was explaining why Alia was considered an abomination. In all, I was truly disappointed by two things. (1) The portrayal of the Baron. In the book, he is clearly the bad guy. However, he is at least logical and his plans are great. He puts deep thought into his plans and reads into peoples actions before he will even reply. In the movie, I feel like they were trying to make a bad guy more like Star Wars Jabba the hutt. (2) The shield suits. This one I do not blame the movie for. I blame myself for being born in 1992 and seeing very good special effects in my life time. The suits in the movie are laughable and should be taken with a grain of salt. In all, the movie is more of a trailer to read the book. You can watch the movie first, and then read the book to get a way better story. Since IMDB is owned by Amazon and Audible is too, I will promote Audible really fast. I highly recommend buying the book on Audible. The voice acting is amazing. They have many narrators for the characters in the book (including Scott Brick who does amazing work in all of his audio books). I like the audio book because the book itself has many words that I did not want to even try to pronounce. The narrators read the text the way it was meant to be read.",Dune
442,unfrickinbelievable,Waste of Time,1,27 June 2001,"I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to movies, but, Dune?  Forget about it.  It's badly done, long, convoluted, confusing, freakish, drags the first half, then rockets through all kinds of major events to the ending.I'll admit I'm biased.  I read the book first.  The book was complex, but understandable--and moreover enjoyable.  But, there's just too much there to squeeze into even a three hour movie.  So, it's no wonder they did such a bad job.  Testament to the fact that there's too much to fit into a movie is the horribly long, confusing, and boring introduction.  Furthermore, the overall look, the sets, the costumes, none of it has a basis in the book--my friends and I don't understand how anyone could have come up with the look of this movie having first read the book.  Then, the movie adds unnecessary elements to the story--making Mentats addicted to some kind of mind expanding substance that stains their lips red is just one of a dozen major changes that weaken the movie.  They made unnecessary and ridiculous changes to characters and made unnecessary and ridiculous changes to the plot--for example, they turn the ""weirding way"" into some kind of convoluted weapon technology.But, even without comparing it to the book, it's just a bad movie.  I don't see how anyone who hasn't read the book could understand it or like it, and I don't see how anyone who has read the book could like it.

443,natokh,One of my favourite movies,10,28 April 2001,"Lynchs Dune is one of my alltime favourites in movies. Lynch composed a movie with a great mystical atmosphear and most of the actors has done a great job in this film. Especially Sting as Feyd-Rautha and Kenneth McMillian as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Another point for this movie is the soundtrack from Toto and Brian Eno wich supports the pictures in the best way you could expect. For me this movie stands far above the new 2000-TV-series. This one might be closer to the book, but imo it's stretched to long and so the serie gets boring after a while. Btw: I found only two important differences between Lynchs movie and the TV-series. 1. The weapons of Muadib and the fremens (sound-modules in Lynchs Dune) 2. It starts to rain in the final scene in Lynchs Dune. I think Lynch has done these modifications because of the dramarturgy of the movie and in my eyes this is nothing bad.

They aren't only impressive but also help to create the unique atmosphere that made Frank Herbert's science-fiction saga one of the best ever written. But this film has also two enormous flaws that make it a huge disappointment: To those who haven't read the book, it doesn't make any sense and it's impossible to follow the plot. And to those who have read the book, it will occur that the monumental and carefully developed story has been blown up into smitherings. I read the book after I saw this movie, so I know what I'm talking about. I really appreciated the former films of director David Lynch, but his adaption of ""Dune"" was obviously the wrong project for his surrealistic and pseudo-esoteric ideas. The book didn't suggest these ideas and that's why the film becomes such a confusing and uneven mess.",Dune
445,OzOsman,A missed opportunity,7,31 December 2007,"I really love the book Dune (though none of its numerous sequels) and read it many times. So, according to my general policy of not watching movies based on books I like, I've never seen this movie, till they had a month of David Lynch at our Cinmateque earlier this year (including an appearance of Lynch himself, who talked only about transcendental meditation, of course). The task Lynch has taken upon himself here was very difficult, and to an extent he failed. I don't see how he could have really relay all that is in that book into the screen in such a short film (and they say they even made him make it shorter than he planned) and how can people really get the atmosphere and background of the story from the movie if they haven't read the book. Indeed, my wife who came with me and didn't read the book, didn't _really_ understand what was it all about. Maybe if it was a long TV series it would have worked well. That said, this movie has an amazing and powerful atmosphere and really manages, with its distinct visual language, to suck you into another world. I enjoyed it a lot in that aspect, and if Lynch could have stayed away a little from his usual love for the disgusting, I would have enjoyed it much better. For people who appreciate good and different cinema this is a good experience. Lynch followers should see it as well. It is a good complementary to spice up the book too. But most of all, it left me with a feeling of a missed opportunity. I would have loved to be able to watch a TV series by lynch based on the book (or a 3 full length movies).",Dune

448,rcrossaint,Over-rated 👏🏻 👏🏻 👏🏻,5,12 April 2021,"NOTE: I have not read the book, I only saw the film.I hated Dune. Maybe it is because it is waaayyyyyy to 80's, or it is just boring. I am a huge fan of David Lynch, but this is easily his worst. In fact, he stated that he was proud of everything he did except for Dune. Here are the flaws I found:1. It is written and directed so poorly. As I said, I am a huge fan of David Lynch, but he did horribly on this film. I would say that the worst written/directed scene is the battle at the end. I had no interest and ultimately checked out.2. Kyle MacLachlan is great, the other actors are terrible, especially Sting. The thing about Sting is that he is a great bass player, but a horrible actor.3. The special effects suck. There is this one scene where Kyle MacLachlan is in like a ball of lighting, (there is a picture on images) and it is fake. There is also this other scene where Paul and his mom are flying in their ship, and the background is not real at all, and almost laughable.4. It is way too 80's. I mean the music is by TOTO, and electric guitar does not go with a battle scene. And the hair is so 80's.5. It is extremely confusing. And there are these voice-overs, and it becomes hard after a while to tell whether the character is speaking, or thinking. I think this issue has a lot to do with the horrible screenplay.6. I was bored and didn't really have any interest at all. I am pretty sure that is because of all of those flaws, and it is too bad this movie is really bad, because I feel like it could have been better under a different director. I feel like the remake will be better, but that isn't a hard feat to achieve.Finally, some positives:
1. I liked the art direction, because I thought it was cool how they made futuristic buildings.2. I thought the sound was good, because there were a lot of lasers and sound effects. It managed to get its only Oscar nomination for sound.However, though here are positives, I hated this film.Summary on Dune:

455,darkscion1,A movie with a lot of hits and misses,6,5 July 2006,"I recently purchased the extended version of Dune and found myself watching David Lynch's original theatrical version because I could not stand the newly released version directed by Alan Smithee. If you are going to watch Dune, watch the original theatrical, the extended version is horrifically bad which I will explain as to why soon enough.To begin, Dune is not a perfect movie. It was made in 1984, there were a lot of limitations, especially with visual effects at the time, and having to film out in an open desert. Naturally, the movie has its flaws on the technical aspects. Mostly it is difficult to fit a 489 page novel into a two hour time frame. So a lot had to be cut, which in some ways hurt the film. Some things were changed or completely new stuff was added which also hurt the film.The main qualm I have with Dune is for every good thing the film has, it seems to have something bad spring up that should have been done better or removed. For instance: the casting. There are a lot of great actors in this movie: Patrick Stewart, Max Von Sydow, Jose Ferrer, Jurgen Prochnow to name a few. All these actors were perfect for their roles and played them brilliantly. However, this movie also has Kyle MacLachlan, Dean Stockwell and Sting. This was MacLachlan's first commercial feature. To me, he played the part of Paul Atreides as if Paul were an expressionless wooden plank. Sting plays the antagonist, so throughout the whole movie I am not seeing the character Feyd Rautha, I am seeing Sting in silly costume. Even though this movie was made before Star Trek TNG and Quantum Leap, the first time I saw the scene where Patrick Stewart and Dean Stockwell were on screen together, I laughed. It was like Captain Picard teaming up with Al. Patrick Stewart however played the part of Gurney Halleck dead on.The beginning of the movie is very well done. Virginia Madsen's character gives a ""brief"" introduction to the movie, where she explains a few things and sets the tone for the rest of the film. Next we have the villains plotting to take out the good guys, a knife fight, some human vs robot action, an assassination attempt, a battle, and so forth. The movie comes to a screeching halt by the halfway point. Most of the second act is explained through montages and more narration by Virginia Madsen.In the novel, the characters think to themselves a lot. In the movie, we get to hear what's on their minds. This automatically kills the idea of the audience getting into the character's head.Some of the costumes, creatures, and make up effects were really awesome. Why David Lynch decided to give every mentat giant furry eyebrows is beyond me.Despite its short comings, which are plentiful, its not a bad movie. Its sci-fi, its bizarre, its very visual, its got action and it does kill 2 hours if you have nothing better to do. I do recommend it.Here's why the extended version sucks: - Its 3 hours. Not that a 3 hour movie is bad, a 3 hour movie with horrible pacing, dialogue, acting, etc is really bad.The beginning is replaced with a 10 minute introduction by a different narrator (who is very annoying by the way). This narrator explains like a college professor the backstory of Dune, very poorly I might add. Rather than show us moving images since its a movie, we get still paintings to accompany this droneful explanation. The narrator NEVER shuts up. Throughout the entire film, he explains everything on screen. No joke. Given, there's a lot going on Dune, there's a lot of weird words being thrown around, but having this guy explain the movie pretty much tells the audience that they can't figure anything out on their own.The ""restored"" scenes should have stayed on the cutting room floor. Its mostly more characters chatting about stuff the ""narrator"" already explained.The first scene where we meet The Emperor in Lynch's original version runs about 6 minutes. In the extended version, it goes on for like 10 minutes. The Emperor not only states: ""the Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes"", he says to himself, ""Why is a Third Stage Guild Navigator coming here?"" and then asks someone, ""What could the Third Stage Guild Navigator want?""

456,dwlarry,The 2nd Greatest Sci-Fi story ever = the best Sci-fi movie ever made.,8,14 March 2005,"I consider Asmov's ""Foundation Trilogy"" to be the firstest & bestest sci-fi novel ever penned. But certainly Herbert's ""Dune"" series rates very, very closely. I've never understood all the fuss over Lynch's adaptation of this novel. I first saw it on opening day way back in 1984, and have watched it a zillion times since then, never understanding the critics points of view. I do understand that trying to fit this novel into 2hrs or less is a very daunting & I'd say most likely an impossible task for anyone. Lynch does a terrific job portraying the events accurately, vividly and artistically. He captures the complete essence of Herbet's ""Dune""., The fremen are exactly as I imagined them when I first read the book way back in 10th grade, Duke Leto & Paul were precisely how I envisioned them, the Baron Harkonen .... just as I imagined, we didn't get to see a lot of Duncan Idaho in Lynch's version .... he was always a favorite of mine from the book,; but, what we did see of him, was, again ... right on the money. The intrigue of the Emperor & the Harkonens filled the screen and the mind's eye, I have never seen the extended version but am waiting on pins & needles for my copy to arrive. The only problem I have ever had with Lynch's Dune, is the apparent desire to keep the movie within the allotted 2hr time frame.",Dune
457,Edewarc,David Lynch's Dune:Fairly faithful to the book,9,14 December 2004,"Today is the movie Dune's 20th anniversary. I'd like to think I'm not the only one who cares. Okay,so Lynch was a little hung up on Geidi Prime and making the Harkonnens as gross as possible. So?? They are supposed to be the epitome of aristocratic cruelty and decadence. Considering how the dynasty started,(if you've read the Dune Legends books),it's sad to think how far they fell. The casting is very well done. This is where I first noticed Patrick Stewart. Francesca Annis as Jessica is Superb! Kyle McLaclyan makes a heck of a debut as Paul! The sets are truly other worldly and strange. This movie prompted people to read the books!!! (Never a bad thing,surely.) It deserves another look.",Dune

The first are those who are looking for flashy expensive over the top graphics with some decent dialogue and structure. The second group in this case are those of you out there who love the Dune Series and would rather be in-depth with the plot then see the flashy over the top Graphics. The casting and portrayal of characters in this film FAR surpasses the ones who tried more recently to redo the movie (TV version). I Recommend One Thing if you do see this movie. WATCH THE 3 hour version. It goes much more in-depth then the normal version and is much easier to follow.

But if it can't hold my interest...I don't understand how it came out as bad as it did. It had the finest source material to draw on, and there was certainly a reverence to that source evident in portions of the script taken word for word from the text. But it all falls apart rather quickly.I have no beef with what changes were made from the book. The problem is with the script. How any professional screenwriter can write something so filled with useless Exposition Dump is beyond me. No one could utter 'Kwisatz Haderach' without taking on the explanation that they are referring to a super-being, despite the fact that the explanation comes naturally from Paul's conversation with the Reverend Mother. Similarly, the first scene with the Guild Navigator talking with the Emperor could have been eliminated out of hand, and it would only have added to the script.But the point that made me switch off my DVD player was the first scene with Baron Harkonnen, ridiculously over-the-top, with comically stereotypical villain mannerisms and needlessly gruesome imagery.How'd they get hold of Patrick Stewart with such a poorly written script?",Dune

Alas I didn't even get to the end, the wooden acting and confusing synopsis just fell flat. Technically I did mute my criticism of any special effects and made sure I made no comparisons to todays near perfect computer and FX driven productions. So looking at it as if it was not over 20 years old allowed me to just concentrate on the plot and movement of the movie towards a finale.

There is no story quite so wonderful and complex. And it is thus strangely believable. Is it possible to film such a thing? I confess that the film misses some of the complexity of the book. That is inevitable. But the film also has great strengths. Visually, I found the Art Deco sets, mixed with a touch of baroque, quite stunning, and the music captured the mystic prophesies and the transformation with a genuine beauty and mystery. It contrasts the evil of Baron Harkonnen well against the House Atredies. The sense of anticipation of the arrival of the prophet and his realisation of his destiny is captured with reverence and dignity. The quality of the acting all helps, as does the presence of Francesca Annis at her most beautiful.This film has been much under-rated. Watch it.",Dune
463,tryfaninsiabod,Don't knock this movie..... much.,7,25 April 2005,"Dune is a tough one to handle. It all depends on if the viewer has read the books before they see the movie. I hadst, so I loved the movie instantly. Okay so it can be a little tough to follow (i.e the dream and vision sequences) and some of the special effects are not in the slightest bit convincing, but it is still a very good story, and provides a different and interesting view of the far future. However, then I went ahead and read the book, and the flaws become apparent. The novel is simply too big in concept to squeeze into a 120 minute film, and as a result the movie starts looking rather second rate, a sort of ""Dune-Lite"" if you get my drift. Add to that an ending which simply does not occur in the book, and a rather naff addition of a fighting style for the freman ( also this does not appear in the book)and I think you can see where this is going. It's a real shame. I want so much to say this movie is wonderful, that I love it as much as Star Wars. but I cant. That is not too say that there is nothing to enjoy in this film. Far from it, it is still worth seeing and picking up on video, and you will still say to yourself "" I really fancy sitting and watching ""Dune"" tonight"". You will still enjoy the battle sequences, feel awed when the giant sandworms appear and feel at the end that you have sat through a darn good Science fiction film.Hoever, I do feel this is one for the Science fiction fans only, as it does not have the universal appeal of Star wars.",Dune
464,Wynand_Sch74,It's actually pretty decent for the limitations imposed BUT,7,2 November 2021,"I've watched the 2021 DUNE (Part 1) and it was pretty striking how much of the 1984 movie still resonated with me in such a way that I appreciate the utter difficulty that Director Lynch must have had in cramming so much into a single movie.Having read the Dune novels numerous times -prior to either movie- has certainly helped me understand and fill in the gaps that many others would likely find bewildering, lost nuances and some scenes not in the movies that I would have thought important.Even comparing the costumes is inevitable - personally I liked the Reverend Mother from Lynch's Dune more than the bulky head-dress worn in the 2021 version and let's be honest, that Guild navigator in his meeting with the Padishah Emperor was pretty darn cool!Those weirding modules though (painful sigh!) sucker punched most of the novel readers - it left a foul taste in my mouth.BUT the ambiance, the gestalt of the 1984 movie was deliciously excellent - en very few of us mere mortals are perfect right?So now I feel thankful that soon a Dune part 2 will arrive so that again the whole of both versions may be properly considered.PS. The Dune miniseries (Dune / Children of Dune) did a pretty good job of telling the story and perhaps we will be so lucky as to have more Dune movies covering those novels as well!",Dune
465,tuffguy98,"It felt like a long, drawn out book report",4,13 April 2007,"Having read the book and loved it, not to mention being a big Lynch fan, I thought I'd give the movie a try. And I really did try, giving the movie about two hours before giving up on it completely. I even got the extended edition thinking it MUST be better than the normal version. Little did I know what I was getting myself into.The first ten minutes of the movie gives most of the back-story, including information about the people you will meet and the worlds you will be seeing - all at once, and by narrative. There was nothing visually stimulating to back up this narrative, only the occasionally changing static drawings that a high school art student could have done just as well.Then we get to the live action part. Except, its pretty much live narration since its only more of the same. The characters exposit to one another every little detail surrounding every possible thing, even details that should have been common knowledge to anyone who lived in the same relative universe. And everything they don't speak to each other, the audience gets by thought in the form of voice-over. It was also pretty ridiculous how many times the same information had to be repeated, as if the movie KNEW that its audience would take occasional naps and would have to be updated as to what was going on.As the plot unfolded during the two hours I watched, there was seriously a amount of nothing that happens except for what you learn about through people talking. Good visuals might have helped, but even the cinematography was wretched. All the settings were dull and lifeless, largely just people standing around in a blandly decorated room. Mostly it was a fixed camera standing far back from everything so it didn't have to switch angles too often. When the camera did move, it was slow enough to be unrecognizable.The acting left much to be desired as well, but it could just be that the actors really didn't have decent material to work with in the first place.Anybody even remotely interested in this movie should save themselves the ennui. It's like watching cliff notes in movie form, except even duller. Go watch the miniseries instead, or even better - go read the book.",Dune

I have never really understood why this was not more of a success when it released in the late 70's. I came to the film already knowing the story from the novel (and the computer games) and the film for me really built on the mythology and brought it all to life and right into my front room.

I love to sit down and be entertained by a movie, however, not as much as I love to sit down and get into a movie like Dune or 2001.  These films make you think more, and too me, are more inspirational.So while perhaps the special effects are not on par (say 2 for Dune and 4 out of five for Star Wars) the acting (4 for Dune, what can I say, but Jurgen Prochnow is one of my favorite actors!) and a 3 for Star Wars).  Plot, a 2 for Star Wars (even though I loved the plot, and the expansions its taken), and a 4 for Dune.So, if you're a cult movie fan like me, go rent this film.

If you read the book you will find that it is just as confusing as the movie, at least at first. You get only a vague feeling of what is happening until the middle when everything clicks.I also thought that the casting was wonderful! Kyle MacLachlan as Paul was wonderful and the casting of Sting as Feyd Rabaan was inspired! I had always pictured Feyd as a rock star personality who was extremely violent and flamboyant.

The only thing is that it is not an easy film to follow. (ie it requires a bit more brain than average). I would like to compare its complexity with the books of Tolkien.

I can see these people as the characters in the book, which I would say means that they did a good job adapting the book for film.This movies has to be one of my favorite sci-fi movies ever.

This choice of priorities also makes the whole thing unbalanced in terms of pacing. The first act is pretty slow, but the second and third are rushed and certain developments feel tacked on. The love ""story"" in particular is so rushed it would have been better to leave it out entirely.

Yet this film is much better than the usual sci-fi fluff, and it's originality can be pointed to the great David Lynch. I've read that had the film not failed he was going to direct two sequels. But it was considered a failure then, and now he refuses to talk about. Hopefully someday Universal will allow him to re-cut Dune to his liking, but I believe that the theatrical cut most likely was his cut.If you pay attention to Dune you'll see one of the most thought provoking and inspiring films ever made.

However, after successive reviewings, it is clear this movie is too faithful to the book to have had any mass appeal.
Little throwins like the Guild navigator scene, or the Baron's anti-gravity balls, Hawat's red lips, etc. are all easter eggs. They are unexplained, visual representations of things explained and described in detail in the book. For example, I am grateful for a visual depiction of a Guild navigator in its folding environment, and I can appreciate how immense an undertaking that is, especially since it is not necessary to the story.

486,DORK1,Don't be too quick at criticising this movie!,10,21 August 2004,"The first time I watched this movie i thought ""What is going on here?"" The biggest problem was understanding the dialogue and building upon the scenes that were replaced with brief narrative (as they were omitted to get the runtime down), was something that failed to help the movie. But alas, this movie is definitely unique in a positive way. There are several reasons for this. The first is that David Lynch is directing it and it is a Dino de laryngitis production with a good budget for that movie era. Its a shame that Lynch's presence isn't appreciated more for his mainly non-linear filmaking brilliance, as is shown very much on this film.This was Kyle McLachlan's first movie and although the character of Paul is meant to be about 15 as in the book, wheras Kyle was 24 when making the movie doesn't matter the slightest. I hope Kyle is very proud of his contribution in the movie for it was him who kept me going the first time I ever watched it. He looked right physically in the role and was convincing form the start. In fact the casting is prefect in this movie. Compared to film failures such as Escape from LA, which also had a great cast despite being a very poor movie, this film tops other mentionable pictures.I liked the way the story unraveled and Patrick Stewart's involvement even though he didn't have much screen time. Everett McGill impressed me in this as he was excellent in Under Siege 2. My good points could go on for a bit but there is always going to be bad points to DUNE. It was a shame it bommed at the box making under half its supposed budget, but i can understand entirely as this movie isn't for the average movie-goer who expects everything to be clear the first time. What on earth happened to Virginia Madsen in this movie, shes hardly here and she stood out as mesmerisingly beautiful. I cannot decide whether Sting was good or bad in his role but he appeared well on screen.My greatest regret was that this film wasn't made into two parts so that more scenes could have been used to build up characters, but where would be a good point to break the story up as it is quite a simple one? Cutting the film to 137 minutes upset Lynch very much but he still remained dedicated. I think if it was longer that it wouldn't have made any bigger an impression in theaters or improve the cult following. A few things were changed there and then too during the movie but it is still quite faithful to Herbert's vision of DUNE. I hope that the full intended version makes it out one day but this current region 2 DVD release will OK enough for the moment. Musician Toto again was a good choice for the music in the movie giving a feel good element. Considering the movie was made in 1983, the effects are OK but noticeably dated as computer technology weren't on hand so much if at all back then. This was evident during some battle scenes but as in the theatrical release they were all short and so didn't cause much of a problem as it could of had.This movie is a like it or hate it affair, there ain't an in between, so you will feel either bitter disappointment or the thought ""that movie was different and good"". I didn't read the book first but found it OK then, but i recommend you read the book and see the full picture as it was much clearer watching it after.

However, his vision is often very outre, which is fine in and of itself, unfortunately it often is a barrier between the viewer and the movie. Between 1969 and 1984 I read the whole of Dune at least five times, parts of it more than that. Though I never had any fixed ideas as to what any of the characters looked and sounded like, I continually find that Lynch's vision offends and obscures mine. Additionally, Lynch has made some radical alterations to plot and appearance which bother me. Those who have not read the novel will not have this problem: these conflicts will not exist for you, though you may find aspects of the film visually offensive. Lynch's vision seems to amplify the outre and disgusting and make the commonplace bland.All this said, aside from being difficult for the uninitiated to follow (not uncommon in a Lynch film), this is a WONDERFUL film and I rate it 8 out of 10. It is a wonderful adventure/action film touching many important social and philosophical issues. I return to this film over and over despite my misgivings, mostly because I am so emotionally attached to Paul, Chani, Arakeen, and other actors in this epic, also because it is just plain fun. Lynch does give a good look at grandness of Arakeen and its inhabitants, even if he violates our vision and muddies the plot.TV viewers should note that Lynch made three different cuts of this film of various lengths. The two hour version (90 min running time) is too cut up to follow. The universe of Dune is huge and complex. Lynch went to great lengths provide this context and set the stage. However this material is easily 30 to 40 minutes of the full film. I find the 135 minute versions (three hours on commercial TV) to be adequate and reasonably easy to follow.I first encountered Dune in the early 1969 while reading back issues. Readers of the book, may know that it was originally published serialized in ""Analog Magazine of Science Fiction and Fantasy"" with ""Book One"" appearing in 1954 (the year of my birth) and ""Book Two"" and ""Book Three"" as a whole in 1956. For almost 20 years this was the ""Dune Trilogy."" Now it is book one of the ""Dune Tetrology."" While I immediately realized this book to be amazing in its writing, scope, awareness, and propositions,it was not until later, until I became aware of all the factions operating in the Middle East. In 1954 Herbert called the group that surrounded Paul, fedayeen. The world at large learned this name and what it meant only 20+ years later when the PLO faction known as Fedayeen came to world notice.",Dune
491,aapp22,Sandworm,8,26 February 2003,"Dune, both the movie and the book are intended for intelligent people, for people who are willing to look deeper into the diverse meanings of a story - some people think it is easy to portray a written masterpiece in a visual form - it isn't!David Lynch is an exceptional film-maker and I truly appreciate his work but perhaps he wasn't the right man for the job/budget. He's used to work on a lesser scale and with more space for creative interaction.
Dune deals directly with ecological, social, economical and political issues (I could also throw in some family vendettas, drug addictions, technical advancements and extreme survival adaptations)Dune is complex and it has its own terminology (books have been written just to deal with the glossary of terms) for this same reason I think that just three-four hours of film do not allow for a complete unraveling of DUNE and its grandeur.There is more to be known about the ""Sandworm"" and I think that a trilogy of films based on all his six dune books(seven really, but that's another story) would be more suitable for us the masses.Just imagine the Godfather or the Lord of the Rings trilogy squeezed into three hours of film.Dune was an expensive flop but there are still people out-there willing to give it another try - Lord of the Rings is just an example (flopped first time around too)Forget the mini-series they are just for the Sci-Fi channel audience.",Dune

493,thenametheyallfear,Why?,5,23 January 2006,"I usually love cult movies, and have an interest in science-fiction. I love the Star Wars saga, and after initially not liking the sequels have come to love the Matrix Trilogy. I though Flash Gordon was great campy fun, and thought Serenity wasn't bad (but not as good as the Browncoats made it out to be). However, I just can't understand, after watching the film yesterday and today, why people I know love this film. I got a 130min cut free with The Observer newspaper, but I doubt I could stand any extended versions.Now, the film isn't a disaster. David Lynch is not a hack, and there are some great shots and surreal visions. People might think I didn't like the film because of the special effects, but I thought they were quite impressive (I'm not a CG-hater, but it's definitely overused these days). Having only read a bit of Dune beforehand, I still managed to understand the basic plot line. However, what I didn't like was the acting and the dialogue, which nearly killed the movie for me. Internal monologues are not a bad idea, but were overused and treated the audience like idiots, when what they're thinking is clearly expressed in their emotions. You might think criticizing dialogue is rich coming from someone who loves the Star Wars saga, but in the much maligned Prequel Trilogy, at least George Lucas lets the characters shut up every once in a while. ""Your father is dead!"" ""I know!"" ""Why? Because he is the Kwisatz Haderach!"". Also, trying to get people on film to shout other people to death is nigh-on impossible to pull off (on Wikipedia I read that they merely shout Muaddib as a death-prayer, which would have been visually more effective).There are some great moments in the film. The baron is so repulsive I nearly threw up, and that's a commendation to the great make-up artists. Patrick Stewart is, well, Patrick Stewart (was this man born 45? He doesn't seem to have aged in the past 20 years) and the vision, as described in these boards, can be wonderfully otherworldly and epic. With a lot of the redundant dialogue cut, and a less woeful knife-fight, this could have been great. I almost gave this a 4, but the vision behind the film tilted it to a 5. That, and the Toto soundtrack, which valiantly defied my expectations and turned out to be rather damn good (I'm a sucker for '80s synth soundtracks).Amir",Dune

495,CoreyRuehling,Honestly Not Bad,6,20 October 2021,"Rewatched this after re-reading the book to prepare for the Villeneuve version. I've always liked this one, despite its shortcomings.The biggest weakness is the script. Because the filmmakers were forced to a ridiculously short runtime to cover the whole book, it's missing quite a bit of Frank Herbert's epic novel. As a result, there's a lot of missing context and many of the characters are underdeveloped. What does remain is mostly faithful to the novel, but I'm not entirely keen on the differences, particularly with the ending. The inner monologues also don't really translate well to film.I love the visuals in the film. Arrakis looks just as I imagined it and the costumes are awesome to the point where I will take this film's stillsuits over what I've seen from the 2021 film thus far. As for the special effects, I don't think the shields ever looked good (they seem to be the only thing my roommate remembers about this movie whenever I mention it), but I don't have an issue with anything else. Sure, a lot of it looks dated, but I don't like to demerit films for doing effects that were standard at the time.The soundtrack is friggin' awesome, all I need to say about that, really.The cast is pretty great for the most part. Really my only complaint has less to do with casting, but rather a creative decision, being that I think Harkonnen is a bit too cartoonish, rather than a fearsome enemy. Other than that, I think the acting is good for what little the script gave them, which is probably the same reason I don't think there are any particular standout performances. Except maybe the Atreides pug. Love that pug.This film had potential to be great in my book, though I do admittedly have a soft spot for it. The best thing this movie really did was get David Lynch and Kyle MacLachlan together for the first time. Without this film, MacLachlan might have never played Agent Cooper.",Dune
496,ortegatwins,A Very Underrated Sci-Fi epic,7,7 April 2004,"In my personal opinion, I feel that the 1984 David Lynch version of Frank Herbet's Dune is a very underrated sci-fi film that has not received the proper credit it deserves.Despite some sloppy plot structure and character development caused by numerous scenes, that I thought were very important to the story, being cut I think the film has great special effects,costumes,sets, and one heck of a music score by the rock band Toto.In closing, I think sci-fi movie fans who hate this film should give this film another chance, in fact see it several times, in order to truly enjoy it. Also I think this film would have done much better at the box office if David Lynch had kept in all the cut scenes and released the film in two parts. I feel this would have allowed viewers to follow the story more easily than they did with the 137 minute version.P.S. - I am still hoping, like many other people on this site, that Dune will one day get a proper special edition DVD release with a massive deleted scenes section as well as the extras that are currently on the UK special edition DVD.",Dune

Watching it again recently made me realise just how brilliant David Lynch is. This film really gets to you and there is so much truth in it. The production design is just out of this world, back when they actually built sets instead of CGI. There's no sound weapons in the book by Frank Herbert, that was something that David Lynch came up with and it is absolutely brilliant.

Now I wonder WHY the movie was.
Dune (1984) may be a product of its time, but I can't forgive some of the sins. Don't get me wrong, if you see a nice 5/10, I don't say it's ""that"" bad, but rather... ""a slow descend to madness.""Let's say that me and my friends got more and more confused while watching the movie, to the point we just gave up. Even the one guy who was the most confused at the beggening seems to be more knowledgable while we just got our brains sucked dry by the ""artistic vibes"".We have a minimal knowledge of the universe and watch it to see if we could enjoy it.
We did, for the bad reasons.It seems like David just use more drugs to finish his script.
Don't be pretencious, don't say it's the 80's fault (fine, may be in some degree), but I hope (trully) that Villeneuve version will be better than... that film? I shall call instead a tutorial on how to... Nah. That would spoil you.You have been warned.

Beyond that, it's a matter of perspective. Viewers who have read Dune first may have a moment's difficulty with some of the adaptations in the film, and overall the Sci-Fi Channel's miniseries was closer to the novel. It's ""in the eye of the beholder"" whether the characters in this version look more ""right"" than the characters in the miniseries but, hey, Sean Young with brilliant blue eyes is worth seeing any day! This is a good treatment in its own right, however. See the longer version; like the truncated version of Shogun, the shorter one is choppy and confusing.",Dune

In fact it may be only film I've seen where the addition of voiceovers, audible thoughts and flashbacks/visions actually makes the film harder to follow.No doubt there is an amazing story behind the production of this film - a story I only know a tiny part of. But judging by some of the dreadful footage that was shot and used in the final edit, I doubt that there was a masterpiece lost on the cutting room floor.The production design is the only positive aspect of the film - I like the costumes and the interior set designs.

The story makes no sense and not in the normal Lynchian way. Here, they rush through the story of the book without giving any time to establish anything (normally I'm fine with certain things being unestablished for mystery sake, but here it feels derogatory). The internal monologues are embarrassing, thankfully they tone the frequency down as it goes along. I bought nothing about certain characters mostly because they don't get any establishment like I said (Stilgar is a good example).I'll say for the record that a lot of the scenes the movie adapts are for the most part faithful and there's some great set pieces and music, but everything else is pretty painful. I watched the theatrical cut, hopefully the 3-hour version is better. Better yet, I hope Denis Villeneuve's adaptation is better. At this point anything he makes could be better than this.",Dune
504,imdb-com-blib04,"beautiful imagery, gruesome story-telling",5,21 July 2005,"I never read the book. The Dune-bug bit me with the 2000 mini series. First I didn't get it. But then I watched it on DVD, the whole 4 hours in one go. I got sucked into this amazing world. I love the story. I find the mini series colorful and expressive, human, passionate, with interesting characters, exquisite costumes, beautiful interiors, but cheap-looking special effects.Lynch's Dune is exactly the opposite. I love the special effects, given the technology available in 1984. The worm cannot be done any better.My biggest issue is the complete lack of humor. Like many other science fiction movies, it takes itself to serious but the characters not serious enough. Think ""Flash Gordon"". The characters talk about emotions, but they don't act them, because the script doesn't let them. So many great actors, so little fun. The whole movie feels static and rigid. This continues with the production design. The retro-look combines ""20000 leagues"" with 19th century Austrian Empire. Some darker elements remind of ""Brazil"", but without its sense of self-irony and caricature.Then the casting of Paul. I find it difficult to take Kyle MacLachlan seriously in this role. On his hero's voyage from nobody to reluctant hero to acceptance of his destiny nothing happens in his face. Same look, same posture, no matter what. Compare it with Alec Newman in the mini series.However, there's a lot to like about this movie. The visually rich production design, stunning special effects, and great actors.The movie does a great job at visualizing a fantasy universe. It just fails to tell a compelling story. I think of it as a picture book. It's fun to watch in pieces of 30 seconds. Oh, how was the hand-in-a-box test again? Ah, there it is.By the way, if you're into the depiction of sexually degrading power-plays, you'll find a few scenes. This is a David Lynch movie after all.

I consider it a masterpiece of art and I always enjoy the story and mood of this movie, every time. Especially the soundtrack is in a class of its own and goes perfectly with the theme and mood of that movie. Even now, 30+ years later, this movie is still enjoyable and can hold up. Try to watch other 80s Sci-fi movies and you know what I mean. Yes, it is a somehow flawed masterpiece but I think especially some of those flaws make it even more interesting.

Dune is one of my all time great sci-fi films in a class of films with titles like Blade Runner and Star Wars. There is a lot to grasp the first time watching it as the Dune universe is deep and there are multiple factions that have their own objectives while being manipulated behind the scenes by the emperor of the universe to keep his political power in check. In comparison Star Trek was taken off the air for being too cerebral and it ended up making history for 50 years now.

509,gameengineer,Greater Than The Sum of its Parts,8,25 September 2010,"""Dune"" has its weaknesses. For one thing, it's willfully disgusting and unpleasant. The acting is bad at times, as is the screenplay (""we'll never make it to the safety of rock... well, maybe that small one."") The effects budget seems to have started out strong but then run out.Combined with the self-importance of the characters, the result can be MST3K-worthy. Tom Servo might have something to say about the taste in jewelry of ""Padishah Emperor Shaddam the Fourth,"" who wears what looks like the hood ornament from a 1982 Chrysler around his neck. (I assume that the Harkonnens prefer the cushy ride of a GM, and that House Atreides thus corresponds to Ford.) Then there is the confusion that the film seems to provoke among its viewers, myself included. And I am not referring to mental games a la ""Usual Suspects."" It's not that the plot is complicated; the problem is the fact that the film's makers did not seem to emphasize comprehensibility. At least, they were not willing to sacrifice aesthetics, running time, etc. in the interest of making ""Dune"" easy to follow.And yet, there is something relentlessly appealing about ""Dune."" There is brilliance in spots, of course. It emanates from Francesca Annis, the real lead of the film. The look and feel of the film is instantly identifiable (a sort of morose art deco) and utterly convincing.Finally, there is Kenneth McMillan; ""Dune"" paints with a broad brush, and never is this more evident than in its antagonist. It's not easy to portray an obese pedophile with disgusting facial boils in a way that's nuanced, but somehow McMillan manages it. His Baron is made to seem human, almost a man one could enjoy dinner with (although I'd recommend a strategically positioned centerpiece, or maybe even a Japanese screen.) Beyond these technical strengths, I think ""Dune"" is appealing - and will age well - because it accurately reflects the shape of the real future of Earth. It fills a niche left untouched by Star Wars, with its campy gorilla suits, or Star Trek, with its Woodrow-Wilson-in-Space ethos. The world of ""Dune"" is one of body modification, drugs, obesity, religious fanaticism. It's a scary, evil, wide-open society of extremes.""Dune,"" ultimately, is a lot more plausible than it ought to be, and has a lot more to do with actual audience members than does most science fiction. That's unfortunate, as is the failure of the production team to tie up loose ends and deliver a more cohesive overall result.",Dune
510,storyteller-5,"Not bad. Not great, but not bad.",7,8 December 2005,"I've now seen this 3 times (the first one many years ago and the third just a day ago from a rental) and felt that I could actually comment on it now. First, like most folks, I read the books (the first five) before I saw the movie. For those not familiar with the books, they are long, so it's no small wonder that this film cuts out quite a lot of it. But this is nothing new. You just can't fit 500 pages into 2 hours. Second, 80% of the movie is character interaction. That is, the reason the characters do what they do is because of things that have gone on before. Again, hard to do in 2 hours without boring your audience (something all too easy to do in a movie theatre or on network television). So now David Lynch tries to put together a movie that already has two strikes against it. In my opinion, he did a nice job. It is entirely possible to watch this movie and not really ""miss"" anything. The edge of the puzzle is jagged, but the picture in the middle is clear. Sure, the special effects don't stand up to today's CGI, but they were good for the time and still convey a sense of everything going on without being cheesy or forced.In short, if you get the purist stick out of your butt, you can enjoy this movie. The characters were finely cast, the dialogue only catches your attention a couple times for sounding hokey (what movie doesn't?), and it is easy to suspend your disbelief and get caught up in it. It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it's a long way from the worst.By the way, if you haven't read the book (or books if you want to read the whole series), do so and you'll get a much better and lengthier look into the characters themselves.",Dune

The state of special effects in 1984 were just not advanced enough to adequately pull it off. It was also unrealistic to try and cram all the first book into a single two- hour movie. It did, however, have a stellar cast; but they were a bit hampered by an odd, awkward screenplay. I can only imagine what could be done now with modern special effects and a series of movies like The Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit or Star Wars.

However, as incoherent as it may seem on the first viewing, it deserves credit for realizing a radically different world.  The story, though rushed and a bit muddled by poor acting on the part of secondary characters, is powerful and compelling.  The scope of this uniquely different tale does evoke an epic feeling. Would that Dune could have been made in an era where SF didn't have to be excessively weird for weirdness's sake, and when epic movie music wasn't written by pop-artists...and in that fantasy world (where so many movies should have been made) devoid of scissor-handed, budget-minded editing.",Dune

521,lchyde,The reduction of a great novel into an unintelligible film,1,13 February 2000,"I don't know what Frank Herbert thought of this film but I was sorely disappointed with this misguided adaption.  The novel upon which this film is based is considered a classic of science fiction.  A visionary tale of the far distant future that is a fantastic journey of the imagination.  It created a world of details and transported you into its vision. This movie, on the other hand, manages to mangle even the smallest details of the book and reduces the complexities of the novel into the lowest common denominator.  The first mistake was in casting the lead. Kyle MacLachlan and Sean Young are clearly too old to play Paul and Chani who are in their early teens when the book starts.  They are fine actors in other works but here they are clearly out of place.  The rest of the cast is fine and I must particularly commend the casting of Jurgen Prochnow, Francesca Annis, and Patrick Stewart as, respectively, Duke Leto Atredies, Lady Jessica, and Gurney Hallack.  Unfortunately the miscasting of the leads and the unintelligible script doom this movie.  If you want to go to Dune, read the book and skip this movie.",Dune

523,michael7772,Best sci fi film in existence.,10,9 June 2000,"It is a classic battle between good and evil.  This film does not shove the science or technojargon in your face (i.e. Star Trek).  It integrates the technology into the background and brings the story forward which is rich in details.  The story itself was thought out well to give it a life of its own.  The thoughts of the characters can be heard as well to bring out the full effect of the story, and the characters.  This film makes you think, and it is for this reason I think the critics seem to hate it.  It would seem a lot of people don't like to think about their entertainment, and at first viewing you come away not fully understanding what you saw.

First, an excellent story (Dune by Frank Herbert), transformed in even better scenario (by David Lynch). Second, great actors, like Kyle MacLachan, Max Von Sydow, Juergen Prochnow, Sting, and others. Third, but most important, a superb director, David Lynch, who made the film even better than the book (and that`s very rare case).

526,agrabel,Cult classic gets re-released on DVD,8,26 October 2005,"Many have bashed this film and others have made it a cult classic. Personally, I was a fan when I first saw it and still remain to this day. The remarkable thing about Dune is how the filmmakers were able to take a complicated book like this one and distill it into something you can wrap your head around. On the other hand I'm happy I saw the 137 minute version before seeing the epic 4 hour version. The longer version was, in my opinion a disaster, but showed if nothing else that in the mass of footage originally shot there was a real gem that could be extracted from it. Comparing the two it's amazing to think they were ever able to edit it down to the final, more streamlined version of the shorter one. the only scene I'd like to actually see put back in was when the Fremen extract the spice from a baby worm. I thought that was interesting and worth elaborating on.The effects being outdated, still seem to somehow hold up, in the same way the effects from the Jason and the Argonauts, or Blade Runner manage to retain their plausibility. Effects aren't everything however, as proved by the release of the Dune mini-series. In comparing the two, I personally never liked the Dune mini-series for it's horrible costume design and perhaps just my own bias for the original.I'm excited to see Lynch take one last stab at Dune since he's had years to get over his own dislikes for it, and perhaps gain a fresh perspective. As long as he doesn't completely forego his original vision as the filmmakers did with Star Wars I think seeing the added scenes will give old fans a fresh experience. Like with any art form, the artist may have something new to say in their medium, and as the technology for film continues to develop perhaps there's room for filmmakers to express their vision without the burden and pressures of the almighty dollar.",Dune
527,donaldaedward,It is rare that a movie is not a disappointment after having read the book,10,24 November 2020,"It's understood that a movie can never do justice to a good book, which can convey feelings, thoughts etc. Lynch compensates for this with narration here and there from the characters. Dune is probably the only great book I've read made into a movie that was not a disappointment. I don't understand the 6.5 score.",Dune
528,koenraad-coel,Nice look but very awkward feel.,5,17 December 2006,"I read the book and a lot of background information on Wikipedia. In my opinion it's a largely disappointing film and the editing and general storytelling are surprisingly weak. They constantly revert to voice-overs because they can't explain the story otherwise and a lot of dialog is blatantly meant to explain what is happening and because of this it feels very awkward. The acting generally suffers because of very dry and formulaic dialog straight out of the book. Piter and the baron are portrayed very decently, while others like Paul and Jessica sometimes look plain silly. For modern audiences I think this movie looks downright silly in a lot of ways. Having the baron float around in stead of walking with supports looks really outdated now and this is especially true for things like the shields, the guns. The way The Voice is portrayed and the thoughts of the characters are expressed, doesn't do wonders for the film's realism (which is important even in science-fiction) and generally disrupts the viewer from becoming immersed in the story. Most of the imagery and mood setting scenes (stormy Caladan and unforgiving desert of Arrakis look great) work their effect well and are definitely something the movie format adds to the story, but other than this it's just too messy and stiff to be an entertaining movie. The main problem is that Lynch in my mind isn't the right director for this because he has trouble streamlining the complex story into a fluent script and doesn't mold the story enough to the specifics of the movie format.",Dune

I agree that if you read the book first, and then see the movie spoils your appreciation of the later. It's weird it does not happen the other way around. After seeing the movie, you will have a more satisfying experience reading the whole series of books. Every passage, every chapter and character was envisioned in the mystic atmosphere provided by Lynch. And, of course, there are the worms. Every time the book talked about the worms, on the back of my mind i had the vision of the worms in Dune. Love it, or hate it, one of those movies that you have to see at least once.

533,BoonieMan,A-holes are like opinions: everyone has to have one,8,4 July 2001,"After reading the bulk of the comments regarding Lynch's adaptation of Dune I realised there was a trend developing. There are fans of the book that loved the movie. There are fans of the book that hated the movie. There are fans of sci-fi that loved the movie. There were also unwelcome remarks from kids who probably think Streetfighter II is the best movie ever.If you are a serious fan you have to keep certain facts in mind when developing your conclusion of the film. For a movie made in 1984 I believe it to be a huge achievement on the part of the film-makers. While it is true that it is initially a hard feature to follow given the cuts Lynch was forced to make, especially to the 'No-I-haven't-read-the-book' people, a second, third, -nth viewing will seduce many people who own a open-mind and vivid imagination.The whole point of an adaptation is how one particular person interprets a given piece of work. In my view it would be very boring if that person simply rigidly re-told the original. Thats why I find Lynch's Dune to be a fascinating interpretation of the sci-fi classic: it's highly original, way ahead of its time and gives a glimpse of some of what goes on in Lynch's disturbed but genius mind.For all of you who love the book but hate the movie, don't despair, you can always read the book again and again to make you happy. Or, if you're really patient, I heard that a new version completely faithful to the book is coming to a screen near you at some point in the future.

It does help to read the book first (fills in some of those missing details) but if you are feeling particularly adventurous there is a longer version (about 4 hours) but Lynch took his name off this... and you your self can figure out why.All in all Dune is definitely a worth while movie and a must see!",Dune
539,pumpkinland-1,Worst David Lynch movie I know,5,5 January 2021,"...and I've seen quite a few.Visually it's pretty good, especially considering the year it was made. But that is not enough for a good movie unless you're on under the influence of some psychoactive substance, which I unfortunately wasn't when I watched it.
To be honest, I would have stopped watching after about 20 minutes. If this wasn't a David Lynch movie probably almost nobody would give a crap about it.I found it pretty annoying that you can hear the person's thoughts all the time. Even if that is part of the book (which I haven't read), they would have just omitted it.
Stings appearence is so ridiculous. It's so obvious they created his role or put it so much in the focus just to make him a prominent part of the movie.
Most of the time to movie is not that bad, just boring somehow.The worst thing is the end which is just so rushed. It's like the makers got lost in it at some point and then had to finish it within a given amount of time.Well I'm looking forward for the version that is going to be published this year. I'm pretty sure it will be better than this, because that's not very hard to do.
Without the good screenplay I would have given it an even lower rating.",Dune

I thought that they were original, insightful and scientifically literate. Great sci-fi. The 1984 film on the other hand was a colossal disappointment and was none of the above. It was poorly scripted, directed and acted. In a word RUBBISH. I went to the original screening in London and the audience was sniggering at the portentous, hammy acting - anyone remember this scene? : 'I am the Shadout Mapes your houuuusssse keeeppeeeer - oooooooohhhhhhhh' (the last part mine but you get the point).Which clown left that in? They must be idiots. Aren't they paid big bucks for their supposed 'artistic sensibilities'? A three year old would have seen that scene as laughable and unfortunately it was typical of the film.All the subtlety of the novel with its political intrigue was ditched in favour of gormless melodrama and spectacle.I would have given the film a zero but the scoring system only goes down to 1!

What an artist does with the instrument of his time makes it a work of art. The screenplay just fits the way the book was written, like the way thoughts were depicted both in the book and the movie. Moments of tension or excitement were stressed just the way it should have been done, the mythical value of the story remained as intense as it was when it was conceived in words.So ok, the graphics are nothing like today's but beautifully composed to illustrate the atmosphere the movie just had to have.I just wished someone would continue the filming of the chronicles, like the children of dune 2003. thank you Greg Yaitanes, still I would have loved to see David Lynch do his version of book two and three.",Dune
546,happyseaurchin,iconic,10,21 March 2011,"If you can hack the nonlinear quality of it, the concatenations, this is the best sci-fi film in my opinion. If you are used to a brick-solid plot-line, obvious storyline, then this will be difficult to follow. There are many elements, threads, characters, and to have them all woven together in under two hours is a formidable task. The film-makers all did a good job. The acting even for one-line actors is superb, the attention to detail of sets a work of love, and of course the range and depth of ideas from Herbert's original astounding.It also serves well as a symbolic vessel, reflect on its potential meanings. eg ""The dreamer shall awaken? That's you, buddy. The hand? Referring to metalanguage, including genus of concept. More advanced investment: symbol for rerooting. If only we can evolve the social equivalent of the opposable thumb. The notable near-absence of computers? Emphasis on the human potential, mentats and all. Vocal weapons? The power of converting thoughts directly into words. And of course the Bene Gesserit's Voice, ala hypnosuggestion. Spice? Oil, but this may be too close to the original laying by Herbert. More interestingly, the psychotropic effect of pot, ganja, weed. Arrakis? The Arab world, is humdrum. How about the importance of potable water, which is set to be the primary issue in the next global theatre of war? Dream sequences? Prescience, not in terms of the character and the fantasy world, but in terms of you watching the film or book enabling a comparison of your future projection with others. The Guild? And the Emperor? The power-brokers: the governments, moneylenders and businessmen. The Guild want to kill Paul before he awakens. Somebody doesn't want you to wake up to the world situation. Guerilla fighting of the people of Dune? Notice, men and women. It's grassroots up. Everyone does their share. The sense of oneness is shared. The trust they invest in certain leaders. The simple way of electing a leader. Hand-to-hand final fight between Paul and the Harkonnen? Conflict should be resolved in this small way. Not the Emperor and his generals firing through virtual screens. Hand on heart when Duncan leaves Paul? Obvious meme. Let's not turn it into the Vulcan V, but it might be useful. The Gom-Jabbar and Paul's test? Reprised in Fight Club, and inherited from North American Indian ritual when a boy becomes a man and has to transcend the fear of pain. ""The film's retro-styling avoids the obvious dating of so many sci-fi's. Since the theme is about time and prediction, it is a beautifully appropriate realisation.""I watched it as a teenager having not read the books.

I do quite like the Art-Deco scenery that's used throughout but there it ends; from the terrible voice-over and ""machine""-voiced narration, through special effects that belie the fact that it was made post-Star Wars and sharp departures from the actual story, to some of the most cheesy, over-acting I have ever witnessed this film ranks as one of the worst ever made.

It is one that is not afraid to include the element of shock but does not - as I personally happen to think that far too many of today's sci-fi films do - go overboard on that particular subject. This version of the film of course, does not really concentrate much on the development of the various characters as the original book does. This is only to be expected - one cannot paraphrase such a detailed book in this respect into a film of that length. Therefore, if one is to see the film alone, rather than to watch the tv-series version, then it really is essential to read the book to understand fully the implication of many of the comments made by the characters. However, the film is still highly intriguing without having ready the book and having personally seen the film before the book I can say that I still found it very enjoyable, if a little perplexing at times.

Even then the movie struck me as ones of those rare gems. Not quite PERFECT but its the only of its kind out there. I'll be blunt. DUNE is not for everyone. It's not a pure Fantasy... or Sci Fi or action OR even Sci Fantasy like Star Wars. It has its own unique style. So why am I giving this movie a 5 out of 10 if I enjoyed it so much !? Because then I saw the SCI FI miniseries. THAT's what DUNE should have been and is. So the end verdict is.The Extended Cut is good for nostalgia's sake and its GOOD movie if you compared to the time it was made and David Lynch certainly tried his best to capture the books to his ability and he did well BUT DUNE has already been updated and done better so no point going through this unless you actually prefer this or just wanna see how the classic was.",Dune

I guess if you read the novel before you watched the movie, it would make a lot more sense. That being said, read the book first. My feeling is, the only reason you'd want to watch this movie is that you're already a fan of the novel. The effects and music were the only thing that kept me watching...along with the fat guy with serious skin problems. One of the few movies I've see that I actually fell asleep during the show.

What you can't say is it's not interesting. Love it or hate it your eyes will be glued to the screen and you will certainly never be ""bored"" by any of the visuals you will see.And what visuals they are!The effects were definitely way ahead of the game for their time and in my opinion should have earned the Academy Award that year (the movie did receive one nomination).Check it out if you haven't seen it.",Dune

567,harkonnen12345,How can something this right be so WRONG?,6,16 January 2006,"I saw Dune when it first came out in 1984 and admittedly have had a lot of time to reflect on the (failings) of this movie.Most of this film's woes can be summed up in one word ... screenplay.But first why I liked it. Set and costume design. In one word, sumptuous. From the neo baroque Emperor's palace to the Fremen Stillgar's sietch to the'metropolis-tic' Harkonnen home-world of Giedi Prime.The costumes were indulgently impressive eg the fetishistic leather of the Harkonnens, the bizarre plastic outfits of the Emperor's Sardukar, the Elizabethan gowns of the Princess Irulan. Great efforts were made to make the various environments well worn and dirty and much of the technology appears anachronistic... of 'technology as archeology', which all fits perfectly within the Frank Herbert vision.Characters. For some reason most popular Sci-Fi movies involve characters that have little to define them from people of today, apart from latex masks and clothing. Under David Lynch's direction the peoples of the Dune worlds are human enough to relate to and 'alien' enough to cause wonder. And lets not forget the Stage Three Guild Navigator ... this was the most original conceptions of a character as you are likely ever to see. Scenes like this give you the courage to sit through the more unpleasant aspects of the movie. The customs of the Fremen as defined by Frank Herbert are for the most part faithfully rendered although being a serial Dune reader, I would have liked the movie to linger more on these aspects of the Dune world.Acting. For the most part good. David Lynch directing his favorites Jack Nance, Kyle MacLachlan and Everet McGill cant really go wrong.I particularly liked Linda Hunt hamming it up as Shadout Mapes ...""the housssse keeeper..."" Dean Stockwell whilst an accomplished actor appeared a little wooden, but is not a problem really when compared to the ridiculous overacting of Jose Ferrer. What on earth was he thinking? And of course there was Kenneth McMillan. The Baron could have been no one else.But ...I am a huge David Lynch fan ... but .... what happened? His efforts to make the vast worlds and concepts of Dune more edible for mainstream audiences while necessary, did not properly respect the source material.In an effort to avoid the complexities of describing the 'weirding way' (properly termed 'prana - bindu' a kind of super martial art form) we are left with ... weirding modules ??!!!? ... what the hell? And to keep them in that poorly locked cupboard in the training room downstairs was just asking for trouble.And after all that spiel about crushing your enemy's nerves, exploding their organs, boiling their bottoms etc ... the Fremen simply go about making those silly sounds which cause little fire-pots to go off in the sand, the Emperors 'terror troops' obligingly falling over.It's easy to be dismissive when speaking from a time that brought us action and fight sequences like those in the Matrix or LOTR. However I felt that the scale was far to small to be convincing (this was the fight for the fate of the known universe's economic prosperity!) Individual fight scenes were obvious and telegraphed and slow and just plain boring. The final showdown between Paul, the universe's super being (actually he's not but thats another story)and Feyd Rautha, was one of Cinema's greatest anti-climaxes.I mean he's the leader of a race of people whose woman and children routinely best the Sardukar and has unimaginable mind powers (all the powers of the Bene Gesserit and more)and still he is almost defeated by the Baron's nephew after a bit of taunting about his girlfriend.Another incomprehensible departure from the novel was the addition of 'heart plugs'. Apart from the constant fear of getting it caught on something you'd really have to wonder why the Baron chose to have one himself. That's just silly and as it turned out fatal.A lot of the psychedelic special effects were pretty crappy even for 1984. What's with the folding space scene which is simply done by the Guild navigator spitting the departure and destination planets out of his mouth and then ... wait for it ... flying between them? Of course scenes like the sand-worm swallowing the spice harvester still cause wonder ... it's more that the conception of those less tangible aspects like folding space or the Sayadina taking the water of life etc really did not convince me even way back in 1984.I also could not believe that Lynch succumbed to the temptation of tying the whole thing up with a rain storm. In one fell swoop he undermines the logic of the entire film. The collecting of water in thousands of Sietches across Dune was meant to be part of a trans generational plan to terraform the planet. It's meant to be science - the movie simply has it happen by magic (""for he is the Kwisatz Haderach""). Given that water is poisonous to the Sandworms and that Spice is produced as part of their life cycle, Paul really is not being much of a help. His Jihad is set to destroy the Universe.This Movie if produced today under the right direction (and a totally new screenplay) could be the most amazing thing. If it were possible to create a hybrid director (although I would avoid contracting the Bene Gesserit for the breeding program) of David Linch(for his quirky, darkly comic interpretation) and dare I say Peter Jackson (for his sincere respect for the source material, attention to detail and childlike wonder that he evokes as he lingers over landscapes, people and customs), it would do the justice to Frank Herbert's vision which has as yet (wether by movie, extended DVD or mini-series)remained unfulfilled.6 1/2 out of 10 , really.",Dune
568,gc181,Ouch.,3,17 September 2006,"Let me begin by saying that I haven't read the books and I saw the 2 hour cut of this movie. From that, let me say that I am so very thankful I didn't have to sit through 3 hours of this.The constant background monologue of thoughts prevents any imagination or intuitive reasoning by the audience. The foreshadowing is about as subtle as a brick to the head. Many characters appear to exist only to fill screen time (Thufir Hawat for one). The special effects, although occasionally very well done, are often missed. During the last battle scene, if you look closely you will see that although many in the background are firing, only those in the foreground have any apparent muzzle blast. The worms are essentially a repeat of the space worm in Star Wars (most likely b/c the same creature designers worked on both), and they go from being these destructive monsters capable of destroying mining plants to cuddly little vehicles for Paul and his men. The psychotic little Alia manages to age to at least 6 years old in the space of 2 years, and I have yet to see the connection between the worms and the spice, although that may be from my lack of book knowledge. With few exceptions, the acting is just atrocious. Give me ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" over this execrable mess any day.The only bright light in this dung heap is Jurgen Prochnow's performance as Duke Leto. He appears to be everything that one would want in a leader. Unfortunately, his death spins the minds and acting abilities of his whole family out of control. In fact, thats the best description of this movie: a mind out of control. While I realise that without knowledge of the books, I cannot pass judgement on the overall effectiveness of the movie, let me simply say that it spirals rapidly into dismal repetitiveness and overacting immediately after Prochnow and Stewart leave the picture. Its as though the director only researched the first 3rd of the script and just winged the rest of it.All in all a very painfully misguided film that should only be watched by fans of the books with a masochistic desire to see all their wonderfully colourful imaginings of the universe of Dune come crashing down into a steaming pile of worm....spit.",Dune

Lynch is one ofour last modern-day surrealist directors.  All his films containboth dreamlike and nightmarish fantasies that seem to come froma world beyond our own.  Although ""Dune"" is one of his mostHollywoodized films, it is also one of his most surreal.  Hisvision of a distant, medieval universe complete with monsterousaliens is very inspiring.  Many people unfamiliar with FrankHerbert's novel don't like this film because they do notunderstand it.

Characters get no time to step into, well... character. Instead, they have a quick ""thinking monologue"" to the camera and that's it. The movie uses the basic story from Frank Herberts masterpiece, but not only fails to tell it right, it changes it to fit ""the basic movie plot"". Instead of showing Paul as a would-be saint/hero/messiah, he IS the messiah with god-like powers and all. Which is just about as wrong as you can go. The only point of Herberts that this film is making, is that if you put a lot of people in a sort of committee to make decisions, they will muddle up things and do a worse job than one man could have done alone.

580,brutez,You really should go read the book...,10,5 September 1999,"""Dune"" is a great movie, that probably won't make any sense to people unfamiliar with the series of novels written by the late Frank Herbert. This movie suffers from the typical book-to-movie conversion problems, mainly trying to jam a long, and very cerebral book into a watchable 2 hours.  A lot of the scenes were of course cut out, and many of the plot mechanics were simplified.My opinion is that the movie is excellent, and provides a Dune fan a great way to visualize the setting, characters, and other elements of the novel.The special effects are very lame, I must admit.  Back in 1984 they might have been somewhat passable, but by today's standards they look very unrealistic.  Thankfully the ""personal shield"" effects are only shown in one or two short scenes.  However, this film does not particularly rely on special effects, so this fault is forgivable.There is also a bootleg 4-hour version of the movie, often falsely dubbed the ""Director's Cut"".  In reality this cut of the film had nothing to do with the director.  In fact, David Lynch demanded his name be taken off of the credits of the 4-hour cut.  An ""Anti-Director's Cut"" if you will.  I think the 4-hour version does a better job explaining the story, both with added scenes and a different as well as longer introduction.  Of course if you hated the 2-hour version, sitting through a 4-hour version probably isn't on the top of your ""to-do"" list.Regardless of what opinions you might hear, this film is truly a classic.If for no other reason but because this is an original concept for a film, the likes of which you will not see anywhere else.Overall, I recommend this movie to fans of the novels, and sci-fi fans of all types... but you may love this film or you may hate it.  It's one of those types of movies.  When I first saw this movie, I hadn't even heard of the Dune novels.  I admit I was confused by the film, but I was intrigued by it.  So I went out to the library and checked out Dune, then later purchased the entire set of books.  Once I had read through the first book, I watched the movie again and absolutely loved it.Dune has also inspired a couple of exceptional video games that I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed the books or film.  Namely Dune 2: The Battle for Arrakis; as well as it's recent remake, Dune 2000.  Both are published by Westwood Studios.",Dune

A few years later when I could understand movies better I saw it again and got most of the story line but it still wasnt that great to me, the story kind of jumped around and left out parts from the book (I didn't read the book at the time).  Well, as time went on my friend kept wanting me to read the book so he could have someone to talk about it since we live in a small town where most of the people here are more interested in ""sports"", the opposite sex, and various other things that I'd rather not do. So I read the book and thats when it hooked me, the book was so awesome I just had to watch the movie again.  When I saw it again (after i read the book) I thought it was the best movie I have ever seen ( I watch the movie almost twice a day on weekdays). The reason I like it so much is because when I saw the movie, it didnt make any sense to me, but when I read the book, it tied everything together and made sense of the whole thing.

They're kinda mean. A drug, produced by giant worms, which allows users to 'fold time' and those who control the refinement and trade of the drug to Rule The Universe. They're ruthless. The big worms have no personality one way or another. A boring prince is revealed to be the 'chosen one', easily learns the mystic weirding yodel and other ill defined super powers, and after the death of his boring parents, fairly easily wrests control of the drug from the villains -- notably the flying fatman, whose grossness is the only element in the movie given much focus from the director.Almost sounds like it could be fun, but it's totally witless and inept.",Dune

There are still some good points where Lynch has succeeded such as the visual image and some of the characters and also the casting. This story should have been a trilogy like the forthcoming lord of the rings, but I guess the maximum rates of the films made weren't very high in 1984. If Lynch would've had the freedom to do whatever he wished without minding the producers, I think the result would've been something incredible.

The book would not be very long if all the background explication was left out and would have no meaning if he tried to convey all his ideas with dialogue and situation.  For this reason the director gave some extra insight into the thoughts of the characters. Despite this the movie was still very hard to grasp for those who did not read the book (woulda been impossible without).  I of course was dissapointed in many of the cuts to the plot and plotlines but understand the need to do that.  I would very much like to have seen the little one on one challenge that Paul had to face soon after being captured by the fremen. Woulda been great on film.  The spirit of the film was intact I think and the characters so memorable that I still put Kyle in the role of Paul when I read the book which is unfortunate because it puts a funny look to the 14 year old Paul that the book portrays.

I was not only delighted, I was enthralled.  A ""Dune"" love affair began that has not faltered to this day.  My feet didn't touch the ground as I left the theater!!Popular reviewers at the time said the movie was hard to understand and follow, that someone who had read the book couldn't even follow it.  Not true!!  The movie was excellently done, its only fault being that it was not long enough or as detailed as I would have liked.  This was later remedied by the expanded video version.  I had no trouble following the movie.  The characters are well developed and complex, especially Paul and his mother, Jessica.The messianic storyline is incredible and believable.  The interaction of ecology, politics, sociology, psychology, economics, and history make this a movie worth further study.  The actors and actresses so resemble the characters in Frank Herbert's book, you'd have thought he had them in mind when writing it in the early 1960's.The mini-series of ""Dune"" and ""Children of Dune"" are more faithful to the book, but the 1984 ""Dune"" movie can never be topped.

The Prophecy theme by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois; the music by Toto which accompanied the battle sequences, so much better than anything they ever did in the charts!Then I became hypnotised by the movie itself: the sense that there was much more to the DUNE universe than we were seeing on the screen; the sense of honour and duty which permeated House Atredies; the sheer OTT awfulness of House Harkonnen; the Victorian Techno look of the Imperial Chambers on Kaitain...I could go on.  Admittedly, the script and SOME of the acting leaves much to be desired, but in this film I believe this simply adds to the intrigue.

594,chriscoo,This movie was supposed to be based on the book,5,17 February 2001,"Dune the movie is an absolutely pale reflection of Herbert's Dune. Dune the novel mixed political intrigue, religious mysticism and fanaticism into a wonderful story. The movie version perverts all of this. Everything from the book gets downplayed in the movie. Few characters from the book received any development. Aside from Paul everyone in the movie is a static character. The feeling that there is a spirituality in Dune is non-existent in the movie, yet it was prevalent in the book. The movie's plot was incomprehensible. Its not that the movie stopped following the book's plot in the middle. This can be forgiven. However, the last hour of the movie goes too quickly for anyone, except ""possibly"" those who have read the book, to understand what is happening. Its hard to even decide whether the producers and directors of this movie were trying to follow the plot of the book or not. The middle and end of this movie are hopelessly hackneyed.The movie still does some nice things. The actors portray their roles quite well. Dune's powerful political tension is captured quite well in the movie. Scenery and costumes from the movie perfectly mirror the images instilled from the book. In summation, the movie has a great beginning, but then it starts to careen out of control. If you have read the book do not expect this to be a graphic representation as the makers of the movie have decided to take too many liberties.",Dune
595,The_Man_From_Okinawa,Read the book first,6,13 July 2002,"As one who doesn't usually write reviews, I have a piece of advice for those who wish to understand Dune.  Frank Herbert created a novel with great depth.  This depth would be hard to convey in a reasonable amount of time. The script tossed around many terms from the book (like Kwisatz Haderach) as if the viewer should have previously been acquainted with their meaning.
Dune is a very engaging book, and to anyone who shows interest in seeing the movie, you'll enjoy the book.  If you see the movie first, it could ruin some things.  If you see the movie without reading the book, it could turn you off from the book.

They did an excellent job of portraying the medieval aspect of the civilization created by Herbert, including the feeling of antiquity, the feudal political atmosphere, and the dependency on mysticism. This was accomplished through art and architecture (eg. the Gothic appearance of the guild ships; the castle-like palace on Caladan, etc.), costumes, music, and lighting (very dark). Some viewers take issue with the quantity of mental monologue in the film, but my reading of the novel is that it was an extremely psychological, introspective book and that was portrayed well in the movie. I don't judge a film by its special effects and while these are a little outdated and may have even been less than cutting-edge at the time the film was made, they are adequate and sufficiently believable to prevent me from losing my belief in the story. Overall a very persuasive adaptation.",Dune
597,tallissmean,dune the first one the best one,8,12 April 2006,"Dune has been one of my favorite movies for years. yes some of the (effects) are a little cheesy, but it made up for it with story, and a strong acting cast. No most of the actors were not considered to be A rated actors. They are however very wonderful. To be perfectly honest after having seen the movie numerous times, and having read the book repeatedly I feel that it is very close. There are about 3 or 4 scenes from the book I wish had been brought to life in the movie. I felt they were fairly important to the story, and thought that they would have made the movie complete. Still the movie can stand alone. Dune the sci-fi version however.... I can not back that movie. I found the casting ridiculous, Jessica has to have red hair it is critical to the story. Why is she blond? I don't feel they cared enough to do the movie I was waiting for the Improved version, and what we got was a substandard incomplete mess. Just something to boost ratings. I love dune. The original is the best, watch it. love it. enjoy it. It is sci-fi at it best story.",Dune
598,nikola50,Great!,10,19 February 2001,"It is impossible to put all of the details from the book into the movie, especially if you have to make it two hours long (or short), but I think that Lynch made a perfect visual impression and an unforgettable style. Making all of his characters realistic and putting them in a fantastic and impressive visual environment, he created the complete world of Dune.The worms are great. They're big and dangerous and made absolutely realistic for that time. The soundtrack I could listen to all day long. It has got that mystic and prophetic touch that it makes me wonder if they could make books with speakers to play it while you're reading it. The only thing that is a little bit stupid is that in year 10000 and something they refer to an ultrahigh - technology weapon as weirding - something magical?! And also they could have showed a little bit more of the city on Arrakis. I also saw the mini-series and I can say that even though t goes into more detail and reveals more f the book material, it's to slow and, besides the desert suits, it looks poor and not inventive in comparison with Lynche's visual masterpiece which is much stronger for the person watching it. And the special effects SUCK! Even though it was made in 2000, the poor computer animation is zero compared to the ""primitive "" effects from the 1980's. The worms are ugly and not as half as impressive as the ones Lynch filmed. The soundtrack can't even be compared to Toto's masterpiece. I think, that if we want the best Dune movie ever, someone should give Lynch a two-hundred million dollar budget to do a trilogy!",Dune
599,chrispav,New 2006 US Ext. DVD Won't Play Properly,8,28 April 2006,"I enjoy the movie. The new Extended US edition looks and sounds great. Color and sound are good for a 20 year old movie. But the new 2006 US extended edition is manufactured or coded poorly and does not play well, if at all. The Theatrical release side plays fine. The Extended release side pauses often on chapter or scene changes. My first disc paused for 10-20 seconds at a time, then continued to play, picking up where it left off. I traded one in copy for another one with similar problems. It plays but stutters to a lesser amount. I have a hard time ripping it to computer to try to re-burn it to make it watchable. The layer split point may be the problem, right where Paul gets onto a worn, the ripped copy, playing off my hard drive, stops. The disc is a dual layer dual sided version, and a 2-disc single sided release would probably have been better. You may or may not have problems playing it, but be forewarned!",Dune
600,vince-213,Timeless,10,30 April 2006,"IMO, in order to fully and truly appreciate this film, you must have seen it in theaters when it was released in the 80s. I was fortunate enough to have done so and its left an everlasting impression. Although there are certainly lots of criticisms over the last 22 years about this film, it doesn't change the fact that the story is timeless and that the interpretation is excellent. The costumes, acting, even effects are right on the money to describe what's happening and the world therein. People can ""linch"" this movie all they want, it'll remain in my top 5 for ever as one of the epics to be above all epics of science fiction.",Dune

602,el-duderino-dude,An epic masterpiece...,10,2 March 2001,"The vision of this film is enormous.  It's an epic beyond our times that sets standards for all science fiction films.  Dune can be a bit complex the first time you see it because you don't see important details of what takes place before the film, and you don't see how things are resolved after. With a storyline so deep, it would have been impossible to include any more information into already 3 hour movie.  The only negative thing I can say it that it really left me wanting to know more about the character's pasts, but at the same time just enough information is presented to keep you interested and wondering...  Dune would have made an excellent trilogy, with this film being the second of the three, but it has been so well written and directed that it obviously stands perfectly on its own.  If this movie has received some low ratings it's only because it can be very difficult to take in all it has to offer with only one viewing.  I recommend watching the expanded version because it offers a nice 15 minute or so introduction that makes it easier to appreciate all the complex elements of Dune.  I gave it a 10.",Dune
603,onethekiller,One of the best,10,25 June 2006,"A truly hard thing to do is a take a concept of a book and make it your own in the form of a movie.I believe that this movie did this very well.If you watch this movie with the mindset of it being like the book, you will be disappointed.....but the fact is.......Going into the movie with the mindset that it is a different experience than the book, you will find that this is an amazing movie, the most amazing thing is perhaps that it was made in 1984...and some of the effects in this movie for that time are unheard...i honestly believe that this movie nearly puts the star wars series to shame..having seen both the frank Herbert version of the movie from 2000 and seeing the mini series...i believe both of those were highly disappointing.....Dune is a classic in science fiction, and a truly ground breaking film of its era.......",Dune
604,JayW7,The greatest sci-fi movie that never was.....,1,4 April 2001,"I recently saw the 1984 film version of Dune, and I have to say that I was absolutely appalled. Except for the performances by Sting and Patrick Stewart, this movie had nothing decent about it. I will admit that it was a daunting task to even try to film this sci-fi epic, especially since they had to make the movie not seem like a rip off of Star Wars, which was in turn a rip off of the book Dune, but this wonderful story was just mutilated beyond recognition. The book Dune is one of the greatest science fiction masterpieces ever written, creating a very believable and fascinating world which just grabs ahold of your imagination. I got none of that from this movie. I will admit that this movie does develope a fairly decent, and almost believable world, but the story just disappeared. If I hadn't read the book I would have had no idea what the hell was going on. I think the real problem for this movie was that the future it painted was just a bit too bizarre. Like most sci-fi movies, this one tried to be so inventive and futuristic that it ended up taking all the basic humanity out of the story. The book was a story about people, while this movie focused way too much on just being weird. If you think about it, all the best sci-fi movies show a strange future, but one that is not beyond our grasp. Bladerunner, Starship Troopers, The Matrix, Metropolis, and even Star Wars were all movies about a very human future that took humanity as we know it today and just placed it in a slightly different future, and because of this they were all pretty good movies. Dune is just plain bad. Take my advice, waste a few more hours of your life and just read the book.",Dune

It should be placed in an art gallery as a true Masterpiece.The politics involved in this film reminds one of the English Civil War and the demise of the Russian Royal Family by the Bolsheveks.Now is this down to the fantastic costumes and hand built sets, or the way the story rolls, In a nutshell Its a futuristic Revolution against Artistic Licence.Well done David.I'm sure Artist Damian Hurst from my home city of Leeds would be proud to show such super work of this quality if he'd created it,Dune is not Oxfam,as is so much of the film Rubbish been constantly produced in the Us Today and Everyday.",Dune
606,bogus-dude,Dune the Movie - Pants,1,19 July 2006,"Having read the whole Dune series - TWICE! I found the film lacking, lacking in plot, lacking in accuracy, lacking in - well anything.Admitedly the book is long and many of the smaller plots could not be addressed in the film due to cost and length. Fortunately the mini series has addressed these plots and, in my humble opinion, is closer to the book and the vision of Frank Herbert. I do, however, salute the films production team for a valiant attempt, but alas they failed miserably.The 1st mini series encompassed many of the nuances of the book and gave those that had read the books more to cheer about. The characters were played by competent, be it mostly unknown, actors.The CGI was, for the most part, very good (I will not comment on some of the desert scenes), the portrayal of the individual houses was well handled with a unique look for each.The 2nd series is a different matter. Hopefully they will produce a 3rd series that will go someway in complete the Dune Series.",Dune

This is book ONE of a multi-volume saga by Frank Herbert, and the initial book is huge. This movie is not how I imagined the book, per se, but that's alright, I take it as a stylized telling of the Dune story.

I ended up reading the book after I saw the movie which is often the case for me, but it also piqued my interest in other David Lynch films.Since I picked up the DVD this year with the theatrical and television release, I can see why David Lynch was repulsed by the television version (continuity/editing and picture quality were poor).

It is like the writers/directors took the names and places, got drunk, then started writing. As for special effects, my two year old cousin did better with his crayons, except for the sandworms, but they didn't stick to the books, so it didn't matter that they looked good. The Dune books, (especially the first one) had detailed and compelling swordplay. There were no swords in the entire movie. There were two, possibly three crysknives, and three or four daggers.

The set was fabulous, and the sound effects were engrossing.  I don't bother to comment on the story because that would be redundant since everyone knows about that and even if you don't the information is widely available.The film has many detractors, though, and actually has been rather divisive in the Dune-following sub-culture.  Fundamentally the Dune story is too big for the screen (I remember when I went to see it when it came out in 1984 we were given a chit with definitions of terms such as 'Bene Gesserit', etc. What was this, a pop quiz?!)Fortunately for me, when I saw it I had not read the book yet and still had a supple mind with which to absorb the details.  If you read the book first I can understand being upset about the omissions that were necessary to make it into a film production.  See the 'short version'!  Ha!  I wish that was fully produced (and available, though the soundtrack is terrible).At any rate however, uf there are any questions in your mind as to whether this is a worthwhile piece, consider the volume of activity on this comment board now, 17 years later.",Dune
623,carla-07223,Dune - 1st attempt FAIL!,8,4 October 2021,"I actually read the book, (Part 1 of a Trilogy) by Frank Herbert. A truly epic account of a Civilization, with History, maps, and achievements beyond ""mind-blowing"". The novel starts with a young man in his room, and the challenges before him, starting with his practice of ""blade-wielding"" fight. Then it goes on to tell of his pathway into rebellion against his Father, by joining the ""desert dwellers"" and rising to their leadership.Through it, the strategies of a Galactical Empire and interplanetary commerce of a rare spice in high demand - which the Desert-Planet Arrakis is rich in, and thus goal of many ambitions. I remember thinking ""what a great movie this would make!""
Sadly, very little of all this transpires into the movie version. If you haven't read the book, you'll hardly understand the story, plot twists, and all its implications.I feel the screenwriters failed down the line on the (granted), not easy task of ""telling a story through moving images.""
I'm giving it 8 stars for the impressive visual effects - the giant worm riders effect is on the button! - but I kept expecting to see the difference in the ""well watered skins of the non-desert dwellers"" and how the young Leader was accepted, in spite of such a difference.Again, it's not easy to show ""mind-travel"" and explain to the audience that's what they are supposedly seeing, or that a gigantic worm-like creature that needs to be carried inside it's ultra-heavy ""aquarium/cage"" can actually ""move"" faster that the speed of thought! And that there are many of them flying around the Galaxy!Or that an unborn child is acquiring the knowledge, culture and wisdom of all of mankind's ages through a ""mind-melt"" with its sorcerer mother!I'm sure if they asked audiences what they got out of the movie upon leaving, they would mostly answer ""fantastic weird imagery!"" and ""Sting was awesome!""
Never mind what goes on in the other two parts of the Trilogy, it's too ""mind-bending""!Still, a great entertainment, but - don't forget to read the book, at least Part 1!It will all be much clearer!Try it again, Hollywood!I guess they did try, I hope they made it THIS time!

That is such incredibly bad and lazy screenwriting.Secondly, this movie doesn't explain anything. If you don't read the book, you will have no idea what's happening. Its a confusing string of strange unexplained events. Its almost as though the movie expects you to read the book beforehand.Lastly, there are a number of gross out scenes.

628,Rorschach-Ghost,I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.,10,11 March 2007,"David Lynch's Dune is an incredibly moving film with flaws that help make it more entertaining to watch. The extended version, although poorly edited, is more epic and provides some of the most memorable scenes ever captured on film (just look at the baby worm, making of the spice scene). However, despite the theatrical version's magnificent editing under the hands of the Maestro, David Lynch, the film just does not delve into the lives of the Fremen as well as the extended cut. Some of Lynch's best character scenes were cut out of the theatrical version, leaving a beautiful, but flawed theatrical cut.With Star Wars borrowing so many elements from the Book, Dune, David Lynch should be hailed as a genius for providing such a distinctly different kind of science fiction film. If Star Wars could be called Saturday Matinée fare, then Dune should be considered a very mature, profound film.Unfortunately, Dune is usually hated by art-house crowds, as well as by casual movie watchers. Many people cannot handle some of David Lynch's unique narrative style. Others do not like the film's mystical portrayals of humanity set in the distant future. However, I have yet to see a more ""down to earth"" science fiction film when it comes to its characters (especially the extended cut of Dune).",Dune

A word of warning, this movie was not, nor will it ever be appreciated by the masses.  It's references are arcane and its setting relies on the viewer to ""transport"" him or herself into the future to realy absorb what's going on in the plot.

631,andrei-92,Extremely disappointing movie,2,10 May 2020,"I've read the whole Dune series a number of times and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I've also seen this movie a number of times before I decided to finally write a review and every single time I thought it was bad.Dune is a great science fiction book not because of the amazing costumes or visualizations but because of the complex world building and plotline. This movie doesn't show anything close to that and one might even wonder what plotline David Lynch had in mind because it's not at all obvious.The extremely simplified version is that Paul Atreides is a 15 year-old boy that's heir to one of the noble houses of a galactic empire but who's thrown into an extremely dangerous situation, fighting for his life, losing friends and family and making extremely difficult decisions. He is forced to make new allies and slowly fight his way until he can take back what was rightfully his.Paul story is quite interesting because it also tells the story of the empire and the power factions: you find out bits and pieces about the Guild, who controls the faster-than-light space travel, through Jessica you discover parts about the Bene Gesserit, which is a powerful political and religious group deeply embbeded into the power structures of the empire, you find out about the Fremens, their way of life, their hardships and their dream that their children's children might live on a green planet. All this information not only sets the tone for the next two books (Dune Messiah and Children of Dune) but also creates a vast world that peaks the interest of the reader.However, in this movie, Lady Jessica is neither the woman that knows how to walk the fine line of politics of being just a concubine while also the mother of the Duke's heir nor the woman that knows how to successfully exploit the myths and legends created on Arrakis by the Bene Gesserit. No, she screams whenever things seem to get out of hand. She can barely run, even though the Bene Gesserit are capable enough to adjust their body chemistry to conceive a daugher instead of a son.Both Stilgar and Chani are quite bland and Stilgar's line with ""You're are Paul Muad'dib"" is... let's just say relevant to how well developed their characters are. In the book, Chani is depicted as a slightly less complex version of Jessica and there is this constant battle between Lady Jessica, who knows that Paul is still Duke Paul Atreides and can have a political marriage, and Chani, who loves and is loved by Paul but eventually accepts that she will not be his wife, even though she is a strong Fremen woman.As for Paul Atreides, the character development is basically inexistent if you compare it to the one in the book. Lynch's Paul starts as a 20-something adult that knows everything, has this inexplicable relationship with his father and gets to rule the Fremen without breaking a sweat. In the book, Paul is haunted not just by the death of Jamis (and one can learn some things about the way of the Fremen when Paul inherits not only Jamis' water, but also his wife and two children that are barely younger than him) but also by the internal struggle with the visions that he has, where entire planets are conquered by Fremen in his name. He does not want to be that kind of ruler and he tries to slightly alter his vision. That's one of the reasons why he wants to be ""Paul Muad'dib"" and not just ""Muad'dib"".Some things in the movie just don't make sense and I wonder why they are present.For example, there are minutes of screen time with Guild Navigators, even though they are barely present in the book. Their presence does nothing for the story and valuable screen time got cut just to show those navigators. The relationship between the Guild and the Emperor is totally weird, with the Guild representative telling the Emperor to shut up and listen at one point. Why? The book generally revolved around the vendetta between Harkonnen and Atreides, while the Emperor and the Guild merely caring about their own interest.Another strange choice is the story about ""weirding modules"". There is nothing like it in the book and the advantage that the Atreides soldiers had were that they simply could fight better than most soldiers (with the exception of the Sardaukars and Fremens). Again, this doesn't move the story forward at all as the weirding modules are destroyed but the plans are still available, so Paul and the Fremens can build others. So, why use this at all? How does this benefit the plot? Just to show some explosions and add the line ""my name is a killing word""?The worst offender, by far, from my point of view, is ""inner voice"" of the characters. This is by far the laziest way of developing a character, by spoon-feeding the viewer with the narrated inner thoughts. Yes, some things needed to be explained, but this can be achieved through dialogue, through camera work and good acting. Frank Herbert has to use internal dialogue because he can't pan the camera left or right, he can't show you the face of a character or how he or she acts, but this is why movies are different from books and why virtually nobody expects to have the exact same dialogue in both the book and the movie.Finally, I have to compare the David Lynch's movie with the Blade Runner, which was released two years before the 1984 version of Dune and with a significantly lower budget. The Blade Runner story works because we can see characters being developed, we can see moral choices, we can see consequences. The main character is not this messiah that barely breaks a sweat on his way to becoming the most powerful man in the Universe. Just as Deckard bleeds and has to make tough choices, so does Paul as he constantly thinks of way to move forward without ending up killing millions of innocent people, while also trying to understand what he has become.Dune is a wonderful story with a lot of nuances. I'm sorry that David Lynch has failed so badly in 1984 and I truly hope that the 2020 version will be much better.",Dune

But if you wish to watch this movie and you have not read the book, I advise extreme caution.  Don't get me wrong, there were certain parts of the movie ""Dune"" that I really enjoyed.  However, a person who has not read the book will be thoroughly confused by the plot, I can assure you of that.  But, If all you're looking for is a nice Science Fiction Flick to watch, then I highly recommend it.

633,Hagakure3,"a stylish, visual, unique failure",3,6 April 2002,"Possible spoilers: I approached this movie with trepidation, I had heard that it was bad, confusing and did not explain itself very well. All true.  I thought that the casting was done well, I personally liked Sting, although I didn't like Kyle MacLachlan as Paul, I felt that he did not play the 'godlike' Paul very well.  I also liked the look of the stillsuits in this movie, they were exactly as I had viewed them whilst reading the book. Thats about all for the good points, I'm sure that the sets and effects might have looked good at the time, but now the effects are dated (although not too badly) and the sets, at least the indoor sets, look rather blocky to me, and very fake. To people who have not read the book, I would advise them to stay away from this movie, unless you are a big David Lynch fan, this movie holds nothing of any interest to you. To people who have read Dune, this movie would be best viewed as an illustration, putting into pictures individual scenes from the book.  This is because the movie flows so badly, it does not lead on from itself, and the constant voice overs confuse things further. Compared to the Sci-fi channel version, this movie is truer to the story, more visionary and original, but it does not work.  It simply doesn't. I didn't like the Sci-Fi channel version either, I don't think that this book can be turned into a half-way decent movie, but the Sci-Fi version was easier to follow, and I loved Julie Cox as Princess Irulan, I thought the development of that character was an inspired idea, although as we 'know' her better than we know Chani, it seems to us that Paul should choose Princess Irulan, rather than Chani. In summary, just a bad movie.",Dune

However, its also not objective to give a low rate to the movie just because it's a 1984 movie and the special effects weren't as evolved as they are now. I mean when you watch a movie that old, it's pointless to take into regard the special effects at all.Every level of this movie for me is excellent. From the acting to the script itself, the outstanding photography to the great soundtrack. And to reply to the guy with the latest comment, there was actually a reproduction for a TV series that was completed in three parts to cover most of the book but for me it was a total failure. It may had better special effects, as it was produced nearly ten years after this one, but it was the only that it got. The casting was poor and it had nothing of the atmosphere of this movie.",Dune

Most of the acting is fairly poor.Many liberties were taken with the original story lines that, quite honestly, make the story muddier and less interesting.All and all a good example of what a poor adaptation looks like.I would advise anyone who read the books to instead watch the 2000 miniseries by John Harrisson which was much closer to the spirit of the original story.",Dune

637,coca_soda_classic,Waste of my time,2,16 March 2003,"Having just read Dune (possibly my favorite book of all time), I sat down to enjoy this film.  The opening explanation and the scene with the guild navigator were cool, but from there it was all down hill.  I'd like to blame the fact that ""it didn't make a whole lot of sense to me"" was due to my watching it at 3 A.M., but overall it was just plain bad (the effects, the acting, Duncan Idaho barely in it; read other negative reviews for more specific reasons why).And its not like this is one of those things where dorks who read it are disappointed because it wasn't exactly like the book and just want to act like they are awesome because they know every minute detail(similar to nerds who derided The Two Towers); it's about a film that had every chance to be good if it had even had a shred of the brilliance in it, but ignored it.
In defense, it had a lot of ground to cover and 2 hours isn't even close to enough time to try to cover all the topics (The Bene Gesserit breeding programs, the fact that the Fremen were superior fighters because they grew up on Dune (instead of the fact that they used lasers) and so on.)
Overall though, I wish I hadn't watched this; maybe the sci-fi version (which I haven't seen) is better, but without the budget of a major motion picture, I don't know how (I rated Dune 1984 a 2).",Dune
638,serath_thundhuil,Breaks every rule of engaging science fiction,2,16 April 2011,"I've never read the Dune books, but I've played a few of the games- my rough interest in the premise and some spare change rattling in my pocket while eying the bargain bin of a local video shop led me to acquire the film.After watching the 2 hours of the apparently 4 that were shot to create this confusing, garbled, attempted transmission of what I don't doubt to be an impressive epic I must admit I'm more confused to the premise than I started out.First rule of science fiction- if a setting element is not critical to the plot then leave it out. If it is critical, make sure it's clearly woven into the narrative before making them important. The mannerisms of the Harkonnen, the Mentats, those strange psychic women, the Sadukar, and innumerable other things the film were supposedly important but the direction and narrative totally failed to explain their significance. Being unable to understand the setting of the universe made it difficult to become engaged.The next huge issue with the film is a lack of motivation. The overarching plot has something to do with a prophecy and Paul's role as some sort of messiah figure to the natives of Arrakis but it seems to come at a cost to his character. His motivations, especially later in the film seem to be in the interest of the Freman, but why? I didn't find their actions to be the least bit sympathetic. Other characters in the film, the emperor, the Harkonnen baron and his various minions have changes in behaviour ranging from confusing to borderline schizophrenic. I'm sure fans of the novel will probably think I've missed the point of it all, and they're right- by the end (which wasn't too bad, all up), I was left with many more questions than answers. But with all the issues it had, I'm sure there's a good story in there somewhere, and I may just take up the book to read it. The epic is clearly too big for the silver screen without massive cuts, but the film tries to have it's cake and eat it too- preserving the irresponsibly large scope of the source material without compromise. It came at the cost of the story. Perhaps a thorough knowledge of the source material ""makes"" this film brilliant, as die-hard fans seem to claim. For the rest of us, Dune the film is much like Dune the planet- huge, bland and inhospitable to outsiders.",Dune

641,mayhew-8,Candidate for the absolute worst sci-fi movie adaptation of a GREAT book!!,1,18 March 2009,"The book ""Dune"" was a sci-fi classic - impeccably written, with a huge amount of background details, a first-rate plot and no shortage of VERY well developed characters. It ranks right up there with the Foundation Trilogy (Asimov), and is well worth reading several times. In contrast, the movie this wonderful book inspired is incoherent, with poor character development, cheesy special effects (the shower scene with the Baron and/or Sting was almost obscene, for example!!) and so many reprehensible deviations from the book that it was, for folks who had read and appreciated the original literature at least, a complete and absolute abomination. The philosophical elements were nearly completely lacking - in the book, for example, the ""weirding"" way"" of fighting was centered on absolute control of mind and body, and complete awareness of their limitations and abilities at all time: absolute focus and rigorous training being key to success. In the movie, they substituted a silly ""weirding weapon"" which was completely lame and and a repudiation of all the book tried to convey. If there was a ""zero"" rating, i would not hesitate to use it to describe this absolute bomb of a movie.",Dune
642,brettmontroy,Worm Spice,8,14 July 2009,"""Dune"" is a movie about a power struggle between the races of four planets; all because of a drug known as spice: whoever controls the spice--controls the universe. The movie screenplay was written and directed by David Lynch. The movie made in 1984. It is an adaptation of the Dune novel by Frank Herbert. The stars of the film are Paul Atreides (Kyle Maclachlan), the son of Duke Leto Atreides (Jurgen prochow) and Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis). When the duke is killed, Paul swears revenge against the people who plotted this crime. The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV (Jose Ferrer) and a Worm like creature with a big head and tiny arms and legs are the ones who plotted the downfall of the house of Atreides and assassination of Paul Atreides. They try to kill the duke's son with a hunter seeker, a medium sized hovering dart which tracks by sound.The problem with this movie is that it was written in a way that makes it hard to differentiate what story is being told at what time; the reason is that multiple stories are being told at once. This makes it hard to understand the plot, so you must give constant watch if you are to ascertain anything that's going on. The color in this movie is crude and unrefined. It is kind of like the movie ""Flash Gordon"". The technology is awesome kind of like ""Star Wars"" reborn. Lynch is a theatrical genus, giving power to words in an exceptional story. The mind is the greatest weapon given to people if they can use it. The Desert people prove this when they use a device to create word sounds that allow them to kill their enemies. Which is technology given to them by Paul Atreides when he joins their clans to affirm his destiny.",Dune

Herbert's novel is indeed a sprawling, incredibly detailed story, yet taken on incident alone it offers enough of what should have been some astounding set pieces when brought to the screen to pass for high octane entertainment, yet even in these it is massively under-whelming in terms of scope or narrative drive. The missteps come fast and thick beginning with the mystery of the spice Mélange and what it means to this future society being given away within the opening minutes of the film- thereby denying the audience any sense of discovery. In the same sequence the Guild Steersman calls directly for the assassination of Paul Atreides the Duke Atreides son- a deviation from the novel that completely undermines his characters journey and the inherent suspense of whether or not this child is really going to prove to be the prophesied Kwisatz Haderach- a Messiah of sorts, or if he is merely a pawn in his mothers plans for survival in the dangerous deserts of Arrakis. This is further compounded by the fact that Paul Atreides is a mere 14 year old in the opening of the book- a story device that in terms of peril ups the ante quite considerably, yet here is played by Kyle Maclachlan- easily in his early to mid twenties- with all the nuance and subtlety of a cold dead fish.Further to that, the decision to make the Baron Harkonnen and his cronies a bunch of insane comedy villains completely undermines the threat he and his House pose to Paul and the survival of the House Atreides. This is further compounded by the casting of Sting- apparently involved in the production so he can show off his buff bod in yet another misjudged scene- and ultimately merely serving to date the film to a time when he was considered in some way cool.So, some astounding production design aside, this is a thoroughly disappointing movie that simply never reflects the power of the source material it's based on.",Dune

I've read ALL the books by both father & son. Watching the first 1984 Lynch rendition has allot of nostalgia for me because I watched it allot at a much younger age. The 1984 Dune much like the book is extremely top-heavy, what do I mean by that? I mean that the movie sets itself up like few movies do, it creates a convincing plot & set of characters who are poised to put themselves in the most precarious position imaginable; Then, the plot switches focus from an omniscient narrator showing us an expansive universe of possibilities, to Paul & the Fremen pretty exclusively until the ending. Despite its top heavy nature I will still watch this movie's first hour & a half over & over. It should be noted this was one of Lynch's first big movies & suffered for it pretty badly, but despite this adversity I think he did his best & im thankful for the 84 version if only because it represents a version for future directors to draw inspiration & wonder from. Favorite Scene from the movie is when Paul trains with his teachers & they ""Activate a fighter"" the room, the props in that room & that ambiance of Caladan was intriguing.I suspect that after the new star wars craze passes yet again that someone will dig through the dune's to find this gem of a book waiting for a remake.

665,tmtrp,the Dune movie could have been so much better,4,9 June 2005,"i for one am p***ed at whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie...dune should have surpassed star wars in all fields..star trek in all fields...dune isn't science fiction, it is literature too inventive and too imaginative to be considered ""literature"" so they dubbed it science fiction..the movie is only understandable to those that read it..what a shame.. how could george lucas become inspired by this book as all who read it were and make his own story VERY similar in so many ways, make movies of it and never speak of the original story that inspired his touching but very obviously based and inspired "" WORK OF ART""... damn them..... and damn all who have the power and resources to make a new and better Dune movie and don't... if were going to remake War of The Worlds and Tron and Willy Wonka and make movies out of every comic book character that ever was... eventually someone will say ""what haven't we remade into a better and still cleashaic movie?""...i just hope the answer is Dune.......",Dune
666,applejackpony2,Most Awful Film Ever Made - This is NOT An Exaggeration!,1,5 January 2015,"I've seen a lot of movies in my time. There are movies that are boring like the Diary of Ann Frank where the characters do absolutely NOTHING and just sit there looking at a clock all day (literally). There are also movies that have horrible plots. But Dune takes the cake on this one. Never have I seen a more awful movie in all my life.I'm not going to talk about anything specifically, but just about the movie itself. Imagine watching a normal movie in a language you don't understand at ALL, and you'll understand more about what's going on than watching this movie in a language you can actually understand. This movie makes absolutely no sense at all. It's like watching a movie series that was 10 hours long like the Lord of the Rings and condensing it into a 5 minute movie. But you don't get to remake the film. No. All you can do is take existing footage from the 10 hour series and make it into a 5 minute movie. Now imagine this 5 minute movie, as bad as it is, gets messed up even further because whoever is editing it mixes up the proper order of the clips and you have random things stuck in where they shouldn't be. That describes this movie perfectly.Now the acting was terrible, the story bland, the characters impossible to connect to, the effects were about a century out of date, but even if all that wasn't true, it still would be a terrible movie because it makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. It's like whoever was in charge of editing was drunk and no one cared and they just released the video anyway.Right now I couldn't even tell you one single character's name in the whole movie. It was like watching a messed up play where nobody cared and was just trying to get it over with. Reminds me of my school play, only my school play was about 10000x better than this trash. I'd rather watch Teletubbies than this movie. For those of you that don't know, Teletubbies is a show for 3 year old children. They're strange people in costumes with TV's on their stomach's and all they do is sit in the grass and make baby noises (there's no talking and no plot in the entire show). That show is a masterpiece compared to Dune. If you're thinking about paying money to see this trash, save yourself the insanity and watch some paint dry. For about 30 hours. It's better than spending the few hours watching this.",Dune
667,minasotah-232-25454,The Sleeper Must Awaken!!,10,6 June 2021,If you don't like this movie you're not true sci-fi fan. Remember that this movie was made back in the 80s. Technology was not easy to come by back then. And I thought the acting was superb even though the actors had no clue how this was all going to come together.,Dune
668,wildbug-88813,SEVERELY UNDER-APPRECIATED,8,29 October 2021,"A severely under-Appreciated, under-Rated, and under-Valued film. Bold Design (Architectural & Costume). Imaginative portrayal of the World and its Characters, and their Abilities/Powers. Orchestrated by a younger David Lynch. Among few Others; its early Sci-Fi at its finest (IMHO).",Dune
669,katbercoo,Such potential!,6,31 January 2018,"This could have been a great movie! The beginning and really, all of the footage up until the Baron is introduced, even the poor casting of Piter, is really great. The movie went completely downhill for me with the introduction of the Baron Harkonnen. In the book he is hugely obese and requires the suspensors to hold up his weight as his legs can no longer carry his weight. He is described in the book as: ""grossly and immensely fat' with a ""basso voice."" He is ruthless and cruel, but also extremely intelligent and cunning and talented at manipulating others and exploiting their weaknesses. In this movie, for some unknown reason, he is given these horrific sores and a character called 'the doctor' added to disgustingly pick at and suck out the nastiness, which the Baron then flies up to the holding tank of this and lets the contents of his sores pore over his face. GAH!! WTF?? I didn't know those terms when I saw this movie when it first came out. But wished that I had. I saw absolutely NO reason for what they did to the character of the Baron. It was one of the things that really went a long way toward ruining the film. Things that saved it were some of the scenes that so closely followed the book...like the desert scenes with the worms. I was so excited to see the movie because I had read the book in high school and was so anxious to see it brought to life. Then they added the 'heart plug' nonsense. It is like they thought us so stupid that we couldn't accept the fact that he was a horrible person without giving him sores. I don't know if this is what people have called a homophobic attempt to make him disgusting because he was homosexual, or if it was simply an attempt to make him even more disgusting than weighing 1000 pounds or so would make him, but both his character and Beast Rabban were made so ridiculous, that when they are plotting together and the Baron tells him to squeeze the population of Dune, he says, ""yes, Baron"" almost like they are villains on a very poorly written episode of the original Batman TV show complete with BooHooWaaahahahaha laughter. Also, the casting of Sting was ridiculous. We got no background on his character at all other than what the Baron wanted for him. None of the scenes that showed him to be a flawed but important adversary for Paul. They are supposed to be approximately the same age. In the book, Paul is 15 at the beginning of the story, 17 by the end and Feyd is approx. the same age. They were supposed to be a mated pair in the Bene Gesserit breeding program and would have been if Jessica had not had a male baby instead of a female as directed. 
I didn't care for the 'weirding modules' either. Once again another attempt at complicated simplification because the weirding way described in the book is more a form of martial arts and David Lynch didn't want 'Kung Fu' on the sands. Still, that was another thing that I could overlook. However...the ending. Paul making it rain...PLEASE! Especially when I learned that the ending had been filmed as written...with Paul marrying the Princess Irulan (only in name, as Chani was still Paul's mate and became his 'concubine' as Jessica had been his father's true love, but not his wife), the Emperor exiled to his own prison planet, and Paul becoming the new Emperor of the known universe. It sets up the next chapter in the series and is so important. Paul did fulfill the Fremen's prophecy, but he was not a God. He couldn't make it rain. He fulfilled the prophecy, because it had been implanted in the Fremen culture by the Bene Gesserit generations earlier just in case the Kwizatz Haderach (sp) appeared somewhere down the line. The missionaria protectiva as it was called in the book. It was Bene Gesserit practice to create religions to suit their own ends and the Fremen were set up to receive a 'super being.' His ability to see into the future was his power. He was genetically manipulated to be able to do this. All of this being ignored and the ridiculous scene of it raining at the end. I wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen!! 
All that aside, when I saw the extended version on television the first time it was run, I was stunned by how much better it made the movie. So many things that had been left out, making the movie that much more confusing. The fact that all of these scenes were shot, and then cut tells us that those in charge of cutting the final film weren't interested in telling the best version of the story, but in time constraints. I don't blame Lynch for being absolutely appalled at the final cut of the movie and the betrayal of any vision or collaboration between him and Frank Herbert. Frank Herbert was mostly just satisfied to see his creation brought to life, but was dismayed mostly by the same things that I was...especially the ending. When you consider all of the money spent to make this movie and all of the sets and a fine cast (who did a really good job with what they were given), it is just appalling that the final cut is what it is. So many of the important scenes that were left out, were shot!! That is the thing that is the most distressing. I wish that Lynch would make a directors cut. I would watch a 4 hour version. Happily! I would love to see the correct ending restored. I know that there wasn't an alternate Baron shot, but I could get past that. One other scene always makes me mad. The scene where Paul and Jessica are getting out of the crashed 'thopter' in the desert and Jessica says, completely randomly and having no relationship to anything happening, ""A million deaths are not enough for Yueh!"" That line actually comes from one of the little poems or short references to one of Irulan's future history books as introductions to each chapter in the book. So to insert that dialogue completely out of any context was another WTF moment! Also, making Jessica so whiny. She was Bene Gesserit and although distraught at the death of the Duke, she holds it together until she and Paul are in the tent after they are relatively 'safe' for a brief time before they meet the Fremen. Then she lets her grief out, but her stumbling after Paul was just infuriating. Her character was so much more complex than they made her. Paul was, too. 
So much potential...it could have been a great movie! As is it is only mediocre. I still always watch it if I stumble across it and reading that there has been an extended version released on DVD, I will probably buy it and just skip over the scenes with the Baron, as I always do when I watch it. I usually turn if off after the Baron is sucked into the worm as well. Not in the book, but fitting...especially the changed Baron as depicted in the film. .",Dune
670,kaotiks-1,I love it,10,23 January 2006,"I have been a fan of Herbert since my parents introduced me to this movie in the late eighties. While it is not a perfect representation of the book, it is a fascinating attempt to capture something that is as encompassing as the universe.It is my favorite Sci-Fi movie of all time and will continue to be so for years to come.The acting in it is superb, the soundtrack is phenomenal and the visual pictures they paint of the planets and people involved are phenomenal to say the least.Lynch hit it on the head with this piece of art and I would recommend this movie to every Science Fiction fan out there.

671,ihatesignupforms,Ugh.,3,14 December 2005,"I can't for the life of me understand the outrageous number of positive reviews for this horrible movie. I've never been a subscriber to the the ""book was better"" cliché, but if you've read Frank Herbert's Dune, and enjoyed it... stay as far away from this movie as you possibly can.It's one thing to take some creative license in a book-turned-movie, but when you remove vital elements of the plot and randomly throw in new ones to cover it up (weirding modules??? what the hell?), you're just ruining the story. The Bene-Gesserit breeding plan is mentioned once at the beginning of the movie, and then completely done away with in the story. Baron Harkonnen is just some evil, insane fat man (not the despicable but cunning grandfather of Paul as in the novel). The fight between Paul and his cousin Feyd-Rautha at the end is just pointless filler with no relation to the plot. The entire portion of the story in which Paul befriends, earns the trust of, and becomes the leader of the Freman becomes ""he's the one from the prophecy OK let's follow him lol"". Hell half of the movie doesn't even make sense unless you've read the novel, and then it's just butchered anyway.Add to the mix HORRIBLE ACTING (I don't know what you people who complimented it were thinking) and terrible special effects (standard for the 80's I suppose) and you get one steaming pile of refuse.I suppose I can't comment for those who saw the movie before the book, but even then, this is not an enjoyable movie. Maybe if you're really intoxicated. Maybe.",Dune

673,daveyr_98,Entrancing Sci Fi Fantasy,7,30 December 2006,"I, who thought I might never see another science fiction film I could like, was for a couple of hours, anyway, pleasantly caught up in the elaborate ""Dune"" universe. The movie had a dreamlike quality that resonated with me. Although I missed the first minute of the film, I was able to follow the characters and plot without too much trouble. The version I watched was about two hours long and it was apparent that large amounts of film were cut for reasons of time. I would be willing to watch the three-hour version that seems to be available. Particularly remarkable was the production design (costumes, sets, certain special effects) which I found highly original in conception and execution. Casting was excellent. On a minor note, at last I got to see the scene with the infamous ""I will kill you!"" line, spoken by ""Sting"" that has been parodied so many times on Mystery Science Theater.",Dune
674,tboehling-00975,Horrible Editing and Discredit to Dune,2,9 June 2019,"So I recently re-introduced my wife to this movie since I saw it when released in the theaters in 1984, and since it was the first time Dune was brought to the big screen. I now remember why I hadn't watched it since then. It is terrible.It's not the acting that's bad... It's the fact that there is no continuity between scenes, because the editors were obviously snipping everything they could to keep the runtime down.The dialogue doesn't make sense because there's no context, and the clunky narrative tries to explain things to second graders.You have no idea who many of the key characters are or why they're even there, because there's no time to develop them or show the relationship to the bigger picture.The liberties taken with the source content are outrageous and idiotic. Shame on the rush job to convert this into a dumbed down shadow of the whole Dune universe.This is a kind review, because I absolutely love the Dune stories - and didn't read them until much later in life than when this film was released. The creative crew behind visual effects did a pretty good job representing the shields.Save your two hours + and watch the unrated SciFi mini-series, which does a far superior job at bringing this universe to the audience.",Dune

How you could not like it i do not know, maybe the story's complexity of politics, prophecy and interplay of personalities was too much for some, or too cerebral? DUNE was always going to be a difficult book to bring to the screen, there were only ever really two alternatives, to produce a bland non-interpretive rendition of the book verbatim or to produce a stylized future civilization in its entirety, luckily for us Lynch had the audacity to chose the latter path and produced what to me is truly a cinematic masterpiece in the old style; bold, imaginative, colourful and powerful.",Dune

I watched it because when I was in elementary school I had a Dune lunch box yet I had no clue that it was a movie or what it even about. Pretty disappointed to finally watch it. Just awful sci fi.

678,studiomutmo,An excellent adaption,8,5 January 2006,"A lot of people pan this movie, so I'd like to write a positive review for it.This movie started my life-long appreciation for Frank Herbert's Dune series and of David Lynch's films. I read the Dune books immediately after seeing the movie and many of David Lynch's films are on my list of favorites. Every few years I'll pick the books up again and re-read them. To date I have read the series many times.I don't have a problem with the changes the David Lynch made, they make sense when translated from the source material. The book is very dense and rich, covering philosophical, metaphysical, religious, and socio-economic topics which any writer/director would have trouble putting to film; Herbert was a very experienced man, and an intelligent writer. Considering this, I think Lynch made excellent choices with regard to his creative additions/subtractions in the movie; the plot foundations of the book remains intact, the action is enhanced, and just enough of Lynch's Gothic ambiance makes it into the film to help realize the bizarre truth of the Dune universe.Everything about the movie appeals to me; the effects, the players, the performances, the music, even the ending titles. I'm not aware of many other credit sequences that feature the actors in full costume sitting, hauntingly, for 5 seconds for the camera.This movie has remained one of my favorite science fiction films during the last two decades. It is a excellent achievement of the imagination.",Dune
679,tripl,one of the best sci-fi movies ever,10,20 October 2005,"I'm sure that others have commented on what a great movie this was. It was not great for its following of the book, but it was great in its own right. Several other adaptations from the book have been attempted, but none have come close to the greatness of this movie. The part I would like to mention is the cast of future stars. So many actors got noticed from this film. Patrick Stewart went on to command the Enterprise. Dean Stockwell became one of the two stars of Quantum Leap. Jürgen Prochnow, already famous from Das Boot, went on to do The Seventh Sign - a great, somewhat sci-fi movie. He will be in the 2005 movie version of The DaVinci Code and The Celestine Phophecy as well - both new age, if not sci-fi books that will be difficult, like Dune, to make into a movie. I also can't leave out great performances by already famous Sting and Max Von Sydow. Virginia Madsen was in The Hot Spot and Sideways - not sci-fi, but still noticeable. Linda Hunt was in several notable films - and several others such as Kindergarten Cop. Even Brad Dourif went on to play the slimy Grima Wormtongue in Lord of the Rings. This movie was the start for many great actors and it's fun to watch simply because we now know that almost everyone involved in this movie went on to so much more. It's fun to go back in time and see what these actors were like before they became stars.",Dune
680,magdabok,"Harkonnens overdone, but Paul's life great.",8,3 February 2006,"Dune, despite the discouragement from many, proved to be a wonderful account of Paul Atreide's life on Arrakis. In fact, it seems that the story is told by two directors. The world of the Harkonens is sinister and exaggerated, whereas the account of Mua Dib's adventures are very convincing. Moreover, considering the technological limitation of the 80s, they did a great job with the worms and Paul's dreams. Yes, I have to say that I especially liked the dreams. On the other hand, I also wished they had included the dinner with Dr Keynes and Duke Leto at the same table as well as some other moments. Moreover, I'd think twice before making the Harkonens laugh and grunt so much. And why was the Baron so ugly? While it is true that Dune is not perfect, it definitely has a lot to offer to its audience. At points, it surprises with its mysticism and great ideas about how to make the universal a part of the plot. I'd say: watch it and tune out whenever you see a Harkonen!",Dune
681,colinpitman-38739,Love/hate this film,5,15 October 2017,"I belong to the camp that read the book before seeking out and watching the film. The book is an epic, and draws you into the Dune world (I wouldn't have sought the film otherwise).The film however places you into the cold looking in through a window. It is very accurate to the book, however as you'd expect a lot of it got chopped out. This was expected of course as there is no way to stay accurate to such a long book and keep the film feature-length.The editing makes for awkward storytelling, and I found I had to stop the film after almost every scene to explain to my girlfriend what was going on (not having read the book herself). Thankfully I only had to do this for the first-quarter because she got bored and left! Sometimes the film deviated from the book, for example the fact that somehow it inexplicably started raining on Arrakis at the end after the Freman victory really irked me, as 1) no such thing ever happened in the book, and 2) the whole preciousness of water wasn't fully explored/emphasised at all in the film and so the rain didn't seem as miraculous as it would otherwise certainly have been. This would have been a good ending to the film if it could have been explained. The book explained that 300 to 500 years of geo-engineering was estimated before green-life could self-sustain in the desert, let alone for heavy rainfall to come.Indeed the preciousness of water was a central pivot for everything in the book. In the film it was only quickly glossed over.The characters and their relationships are not explored, with many (Stilgar, for example) that have a major role in the book getting insignificant roles in the film. The majority of the acting has no passion and is wooden.These are the reasons I hate this film. But why do I love it at the same time?The scenes, set design, props, costumes, and graphics, are all rich and stir the imagination and are well within the theme of the book. Even the early CGI work (used to render shields) is fairly impressive considering it was 1984. To some it may look a bit naff, but then who are we to say what shields look like in the year 10,000?My review is certainly biased from reading the book. But then this was a film that was purposely made from the book. I think that maybe they would have been better off 'basing' the film on the book, and coming up with a story more suited to film.",Dune

The Emperor is portrayed as a weakling who bows to the will of the spacing guild at the drop of a hat, VERY REGAL. Even the Fremen were misrepresented. Where were their Burkas, the capes, the disdain they had for the fighting ability of their enemies? This movie did not impress me as a story of a feudal coup for revenge against a generation's long enemy nor as a Baron capable of plotting the overthrow a galactic emperor. I doubt the screen writer ever read the book.",Dune
686,YnvTlmr,Simply horrible story-telling,1,25 November 2007,"This movie was bad for many reasons, and i could go on for quite a while listing them.before reading my long rant, i would like to recommend the Dune miniseries (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142032/) and the Children of Dune miniseries (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0287839/). its a great series, and although it takes some minor liberties with the plot, its told well, and gets the story across smoothly and enjoyably.and now, on with the review:the primary fault of this movie, which made it unwatchable was the pacing. the first half of the movie focuses on the first tenth of the book. it is reenacted in every nauseating detail, including thought overs. now i am all for literal accuracy , but i was watching the movie for an hour, and the catalytic event for the story was hardly on the horizon.so I'm nearly falling asleep watching this, and suddenly there is a dramatic shift in the pace, which would normally be good, except they aren't telling the story faster, they are simply not telling it. the second half is like watching the first half, except cutting out 30 minutes of footage for every 5 minutes shown. its flash cut scenes at best, and unless you've read the book you would have no idea whats going on. on top of this, the director took some rather strange and unnecessary liberties with the plot, such that at some points it doesn't even remotely resemble the book.so the end finally rolls around, and the director completely destroyed any credibility he had left by changing the ending to the complete polar opposite of the books. i can understand subtly shaping the plot to make the movie easier to tell through film, but it was not the case here. the ending was told through voice over narrative, telling of future events not filmed.in conclusion, don't waste your time with this film, unless you are specifically looking to watch a poorly made movie from the 80's with excessive guitar shreds. watch the miniseries instead, you'll be glad you did.",Dune

I enjoyed the mini-series release in 200X but the caliber of actors was better in this original adaptation of the book.I would recommend to watch it alone on a quite evening. It's very realistic, as in believable sci-fi, as in believable characters and situations. If you haven't seen it yet, again I recommend read Frank Herbert's Dune and then after awhile watch the movie to get the most out of it.
