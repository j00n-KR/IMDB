0,TheLittleSongbird,Trick or treat,7,25 October 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic, as a horror film it is one of the most iconic ones and very influential. To this day it is still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters, and characters overall, in Michael Myers.The numerous follow-ups are very hit and miss (leaning towards the miss), with none of them being anywhere near as good and the quality decline generally was pretty drastic. 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' was an exception, while the Rob Zombie films and 'Halloween: Resurrection' were abominations. Hearing that there was going to be another film, part of me was really excited as it did look very creepy and word of mouth was positive. There was a little nervousness though as well, due to not being impressed generally with most of the 'Halloween' follow ups. Watched it though as part of my seeing as many 2018 films as possible quest, which has been a worthwhile one mostly but also hit and miss.Found myself breathing a big sigh of relief walking out of the cinema. While 'Halloween' (2018) is nowhere near as good as the 1978 classic, alongside 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' it is one of the best of the series since. There are flaws and it is not one of my favourites of the year, but there are a lot of strengths and there have been worse films this year. As far as 2018 horror films go, the year has been patchy for horror, it's one of the best ones on the most part.Starting with 'Halloween's' (2018) problems, some of the humour is misplaced and out of kilter too much with the rest of the film and a few elements of the story could have been explored and gone further more.The big twist also didn't seem fully realised although a brave one and the ending felt rushed and abrupt, also felt that there could have been more tension and less unintentionally silly camp. Have always been wary of open-ended endings and that they can be dangerous to do in case a planned sequel falls through.However, there is an awful lot to like about 'Halloween' (2018). Along with 'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later' it is the best looking of the follow-ups, it is very eerily shot and is close in style to the autumnal look and visual iconography of the original, something that most of the follow-ups failed to do. Loved the haunting music score, here an asset rather than a drawback in how it adds a lot to the atmosphere and enhances it, coming close too in being a character of its own.While flawed, the script is mostly smart with in-jokes and references that are effectively embedded and coming over as affectionate rather than random. There are humorous moments too. 'Halloween' (2018) succeeds in being fun and creepy, with the atmosphere being riddled with tension and suspense. The deaths are horrifyingly creative and the most shocking since 'Halloween H20', the gore not going overboard on the shock value or looking cheap, not distracting at all. The beginning is unsettlingly tense and Michael Myers has not been this freaky in a long time. Some moments have surprising heart and the scares made me jump and bite my nails. It was great for the film to return to the franchise's roots and treat the original with respect, while with enough new touches of its own. One of the better examples this year in attempts to cater to everybody.Didn't find myself annoyed by the characters and there was personality to them to stop them from being bland. 'Halloween' (2018) is one of the best acted 'Halloween' films. Jamie Lee Curtis has still got it, none of what made her character great is lost or forgotten, and Nick Castle is supremely terrifying as Myers.Concluding, didn't bowl me over but found myself enjoying it all the same. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween
1,Leofwine_draca,Adequate,6,7 December 2019,"HALLOWEEN is the latest reboot/sequel to the John Carpenter classic, and that it manages to be an enjoyable, adequate watch says a lot for the way this franchise has been driven into the ground. This one's notable for ignoring all of the silly conspiracy threads and theories of the many sequels, instead going back to basics. Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Laurie Strode, a kind of survivalist in the Sarah Connor mould, waiting for Myers to come back as she knows he will. The rest of the film is well made by Blumhouse Productions, quite classily directed and taking time to build suspense over endless gore effects, which I appreciated. There are problems, like boring youthful characters, random unnecessary humour and wonky writing at times, but the scare scenes manage to be ominous and I did like the way the climax keeps on referencing events of the original.",Halloween
2,SnoopyStyle,expected better,6,30 July 2019,"Using only the original movie as canon, it's been 40 years since Michael Myers' rampage. He has been mute under the care of Dr. Sartain in Smith's Grove Sanitarium. True crime podcasters Aaron Korey and Dana Haines have come to entice Michael to speak by bringing along his mask. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has become an obsessive survivalist. She is estranged from her daughter Karen Nelson (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak).I think I expected too much. It's obvious that these guys have great respect for the franchise. The mechanics of the movie is well done and respectful of the original. There are issues with the writing. First, the retrieval of his mask cannot be an accident. It's convenience of story writing that annoyed me when it could have been a great way to show Michael's relentlessness. He should attack a motel where the two podcasters are staying. He could go from room to room murdering everyone until he found his mask. There is more horror in his relentless ruthlessness. In this movie, it's a happy accident. As for Laurie's house, I have issues with its construction. She's supposed to be obsessed with this inevitable situation and it's not as well prepared as it could be. First, there are a lot of windows. The walls seem thin. There should be one button to lock up the whole building and the windows (again) should be blocked by lowering metal bars. It makes no sense to set up basement to burn which seems to be more problematic than realistic. She should have better guns. She should have body armor. Did he bring in the mannequins or did Laurie have a bunch of them in the home? I do appreciate some of call-backs. This is a good horror. I'm just set for something great and it's a little disappointing.",Halloween
3,Horst_In_Translation,A good watch in its own right,6,29 October 2018,"The title ""Halloween"" says it all I believe. This new 2018 movie is closely connected to the 1978 horror classic. Actually, it follows right afterward chronologically, despite a break of several decades, but ignores all the other films that were made. Director is David Gordon Green and he is also part of many writers working on this one. A name you would not really expect here is Danny McBride. It's certainly no case of too many cooks spoiling the broth and I enjoyed the watch from start to finish during these 105 minutes. Horror is not necessarily my genre and I am criticial about some of the films that make up the wave of modern takes on old classics like ""It"" for example. This one here is well executed though. By the way let me say quickly that I have not (yet) seen the 1978 film this follows up on. Now back to this one here. I liked many of the classic references, like when the boy gets caught in the car. Or many other ruthless murder scenes where the film feels absolutely no need to go easy on the audience. Myers' killing is irrational most of the time. He is personified evil. There is no logic to his idea of who lives and who dies. And I must say it was huge fun watching him on his murderous trail. The side stories are okay too. The boys troubles of the daughter were a bit meh, but after struggling a bit initially with the two reporters, I really liked their story the longer it went. It is one of these parts of people who randomly cross Myers' path like so many others and we get some background infortmation on this duo.The core story is okay. I must say I struggled a bit in seeing the significance of Laurie Strode, but like I said that could be very well due to me not being familiar with the original. But honestly, Myers takes out several well-trained men. Effortlessly. And then he struggles with a woman aged 60 perhaps? Repeatedly? This didn't make too much sense. The female power emphasis at the end with grandmother, mother and daughter (to a lesser extent) felt a bit forced too in terms of how much they killed off the men to go through with that idea. Has a bit feel-bad #metoo attached to its idea. A bit too much. Nonetheless, I did like the idea how they brought back so many actors and characters from the old film. That certainly is a nice tribute and those who like or even love the old movie will definitely enjoy the inclusion. Overall, I was well entertained here. the minutes flew by and there wasn't really a single scene when I was bored, but kept wondering what happens next. It was also well done I think how characters we know nothing about are killed and there is never a moment like ""couldn't care less"", not for me and I am sure not for most other audience members either. Well, there was only one other in my viewing, but this definitely also had to do with the fact that this is not exactly a film most people watch at 2 or 3 pm in the afternoon. I recommend seeing this new movie. It's not gonna find its place in lists of legendary horror movies, but it was damn entertaining. Go see it if you can on the big screen. Take the chance before it vanishes very quickly come November and Halloween is gone for a year again. Still, story-wise the Halloween (the event, not the old film) references were minimal in my opinion, so you can watch it in December or so too.",Halloween
4,nogodnomasters,Say Something Michael,7,1 November 2018,"Haddenfield, Illinois forty years later. Michael Myers is being transported from his asylum to another location and you can guess the rest because Hollywood lacks originality. Meanwhile, Gran-bo Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) has been preparing for an armed confrontation for a man with a life sentence. She also has a daughter and granddaughter to add to the mix.The film had a number of slow scenes. PLOT SPOILER. I was happy when Oscar died. He was annoying, but then again so was Jamie Lee Curtis. The last fifteen minutes was the final cat and mouse conflict. It was done well, but the rest of the film ran hot and cold.Guide: F-word. No sex. Brief nudity from the first film.",Halloween
5,kosmasp,Worthy sequel,8,3 May 2019,"If you see the very first one or remember it very well, right from the start you will see the connection. Yes the credits indicate we get the ""true""(?) sequel to the original Halloween. And there are so many nice little treats spread throughout the movie (an actress from the first movie reappearing in a different role, but also shots that are almost the same as in the original ... but sometimes there is a twist for the viewers).The original two main actors reprising their roles too (even if some may argue you can't tell with Myers because of his mask). This really is a service to fans and a movie that cherishes the original. Of course since the myriads of sequels introduced a lot of stuff, most of which is thrown out the window (no pun intended). One of the primary things being that like in the original, the Killer and the chosen victim are not related. Even so they have a special bond/relationship. So the only movie you need to watch before this, is the Original movie from 1978 - it will be worth your time. The ending of this new one may feel for some like a let down, but it is what it is and even if it feels like a letdown, it still sort of works in the whole picture",Halloween
6,Sleepin_Dragon,A surprise package.,8,2 November 2018,"I half expected the usual, cheap thrills, jumpy moments, and liberties taken with the legacy of Michael Myers, but........a total and utter surprise, this was a quality film, one that felt as if it had a level of respect for its original, it respected its roots, but forgot all those that came between, perhaps no bad thing.Michael Myers the man, he transformed years back into some kind of superhero villain, unable to die, able to die and come back life, here he's treated as just a man, very well done.The writing is fantastic, I loved the story, and how it played out, if only previous films were this standard. The music was absolutely fantastic, I loved it, the best of the original.Gripping, well acted, exciting, intriguing. Ranks second after the original. 8/10",Halloween
7,lee_eisenberg,so we've come to it,10,20 October 2018,"Ah, Halloween. The franchise that started the slasher genre. Ever since John Carpenter introduced the world to Michael Myers (not to be confused with the actor who played Austin Powers) his ""Psycho""-influenced movie in 1978, it's been one of the most important parts of US popular culture. After a few crummy entries in the series, it brought back Jamie Lee Curtis in 1998's ""Halloween: H20"" (in which her horror veteran mom co-starred), which retconned* the events of parts 4-6 out of the series.So now we have the latest ""Halloween"". This is a good one. A direct sequel to the 1978 movie, it depicts Laurie going to great lengths to protect her daughter and granddaughter from Myers. And now that he's back, it's time to take charge.You're sure to love it. I did.*Retroactive continuity is when a franchise ignores something that happened previously therein.",Halloween
8,jboothmillard,Halloween,7,30 October 2018,"This is the eleventh movie in the Halloween franchise (ninth if you don't count the Rob Zombie remakes), made forty years since the first film. It is a sequel, but it disqualifies all previous sequels (many with mixed to negative results) and their events, as if they never happened, it is a direct follow-on to the 1978 original, directed by David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, The Sitter). Basically, forty years have passed since the babysitter murders in Haddonfield, Illinois; the murderer Michael Myers (Nick Castle, the original Michael from 1978, and James Jude Courtney) is now incarcerated in Smith's Grove Rehabilitation Hospital (formerly Sanatarium). True-crime podcasters Aaron Korey (Jefferson Hall) and Dana Haines (Rhian Rees) have travelled to the hospital to interview Myers and his handler, psychiatrist Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), who has taken over the role of Samuel Loomis who passed away. The podcasters want to obtain answers from Michael himself about his past actions, he has not spoken a word in forty years, he will be transported to a new facility soon. Aaron and Dana then arrive unannounced at heavily armed and guarded home of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the only surviving babysitter from the night of the murders. The interviewers attempt to bribe her to agree to an interview, but she refuses to answer any questions and tells them to leave. Laurie has since developed PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and spent the last forty years preparing for Michael's return, with various security precautions and weapons training. The following night, Sartain sabotages the transport carrying Michael and other patients, allowing Michael to finally escape. A passing car with a father and his young son arrives at the scene of the crash, Sartain is injured with a rifle by the child out of fear looking for his father who leaves the car. At a gas station the morning after, Michael recovers his mask from Aaron and Dana's car, he brutally murders the podcasters, a mechanic and a clerk, he then drives back to Haddonfield. Laurie attempts to warn her estranged daughter Karen (Judy Greer) about Michael's getaway, but she dismisses her mother's concerns. On Halloween night, Karen's daughter Allyson (Andi Matichak), Laurie's granddaughter, finds her boyfriend Cameron Elam (son of Lonnie Elam from the first film) (Dylan Arnold) cheating on her. Michael continues his killing spree in the Haddonfield suburb, murdering Allyson's best friend Vicky (Virginia Gardner), her boyfriend Dave (Miles Robbins), and several neighbours, but he is forced to retreat when Laurie and Deputy Frank Hawkins (Will Patton) come looking and open fire at him. Laurie convinces Karen and her husband Ray Nelson (Toby Huss) to head to her house for their protection. Allyson encounters Michael shortly after he kills Cameron's best friend Oscar (Drew Scheid), she is rescued by Hawkins and Sartain, now working alongside the local police to find Michael. Hawkins locates Michael, he impacts him with his vehicle, but Sartain, obsessed with Michael's enigmatic motivations, kills Hawkins before he can kill Michael. Sartain abducts Allyson and brings unconscious Michael for a conflict at Laurie's home between him and her family, Sartain wants to decipher the killer's true nature. Michael regains consciousness and kills Sartain as well as two police officers who arrive, while Allyson flees into the woods. Michael arrives at Laurie's fortified house and kills Ray, while Karen hides in the concealed underground basement and Laurie goes on the offensive. Michael breaks into the house, he attacks and evades Laurie, Allyson stumbles inside and enters the basement, where she meets her mother. Although Michael finds them, Laurie and Karen ambush him and trap him inside the basement. The house is set on fire, Laurie, Karen, and Allyson embrace and escape hitching a ride in the back of a pickup truck, the burning basement is shown, but Michael is nowhere to be seen, but his breathing is heard after the end credits, indicating he may have survived. Also starring Sophia Miller as young Karen, Jibrail Nantambu as Julian Morrisey, Omar Dorsey as Sheriff Barker, Halloween's PJ Soles as Teacher and Colin Mahan as the voice of Dr. Samuel Loomis. So, Laurie Strode is no longer the sister of masked psycho killer Michael Myers (the twist of Halloween II, in 1981), and she is no longer dead (Michael killed her in Halloween: Resurrection, in 2002), you can ignore Halloween III: Season of the Witch as well, the worst of the sequels, and no established characters featured in it. The only problem I had with this reboot was the film title, it is confusing, not being called Halloween Returns or something, but I was always going to see it no matter what. Curtis as the still-traumatised survivor has turned from victim to ass-kicking strong woman ready to face the psycho, the unstoppable killer is still as menacing as ever, the action flows well, it gets tense in the right moments, the bloody violence is eye-catching, and little hints back to the other movies, including the shrivelled pumpkin reversing at the beginning, are all good, this is definitely a return to form, a most worthwhile slasher horror. Very good!",Halloween
9,BA_Harrison,The original sequel was better.,4,19 October 2018,"For this latest movie in the Halloween franchise, the writers have conveniently forgotten all about the numerous other sequels (and Rob Zombie's lamentable movies); similarly, I'm going to try my hardest to forget all about this film and hope that next time they do it right.Alarm bells originally started ringing when I heard that Danny McBride was one of those responsible for this particular return of Michael Myers, but a good review gave me hope, so, like a fool, I got in line on opening day. To say that I am disappointed is an understatement...The film starts with two podcasters being allowed to meet Michael Myers in his high-security mental institution (it seems that podcasting can get that kind of approval). On confronting Michael, one of the podcasters reaches into his bag, removes Michael's iconic rubber mask (which surely would have deteriorated into brittle pieces by now), and begins screaming at the killer to talk to him, as though aggravating an insane mass murderer is acceptable behaviour. Cue titles.We then get to meet Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her dysfunctional family: daughter Karen (Judy Greer), Karen's husband Ray (Toby Huss), and Laurie's grand-daughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). Laurie has spent the last forty years (and presumably a vast fortune) building a booby-trapped fortress in preparation for her inevitable reunion with Michael, all of which has proven a strain on family ties. Of course, Laurie was right to do this, for when Michael is transferred to a new hospital, he promptly escapes (we're not shown how - we just have to accept this).After somehow tracking down the podcasters to reclaim his mask, Michael heads for Haddonfield to kill a few teenagers before turning his attention to Laurie and her family.The lazy writing and direction includes pointless romantic strife between Allyson and her boyfriend Cameron (Dylan Arnold) that does nothing to further the plot, a really ridiculous twist involving Michael's doctor Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), heavy-handed nods to Carpenter's original, several dumb jump scares, some silly gore (the head apparently being as easy to stab or squash as a pumpkin), and a few moments of levity that are there to relieve the tension (what tension?), but which simply seem out of place.3.5/10, rounded up to 4 for John Carpenter's updated score, which deserves to accompany a much better film.",Halloween
10,paul_haakonsen,Myers is back...,6,6 January 2019,"While I am a big fan of horror and slasher films in general, I can't really claim to ever have been much of a fan of Michael Myers. Why? Well, I think maybe because I always found Jason Voorhees to be more menacing and had way more interesting kills. Morbid, yeah, I know.But I have been watching the ""Halloween"" movies throughout the years, simply because they have been readily available and also because they are slasher films after all. So of course I would also get around to watching the 2018 ""Halloween"" movie. Imagine that, 40 years after the very first movie, and here we are.There have been some less than average sequels in the bunch for sure, so I must admit that I wasn't expecting overly much from this newest movie. But it turned out to actually be an adequate addition to the franchise. And I must admit that I was actually genuinely entertained by the movie.The 2018 ""Halloween"" movie definitely upped the brutality of the murders committed by Myers throughout the movie. And they are quite visual as well. For a seasoned horror veteran like me, that is pure candy, because it adds so much more to the movie.Storywise then there weren't anything overly new here. Myers escapes from captivity like so many times before and heads back to Haddonfield where he resumes his murdering rampage on Halloween. Yup, that was essentially it, so there is nothing new here actually.It was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis return to reprise her role after all this time.All in all, ""Halloween"" is worth taking the time to watch, both if you are a fan of the franchise or just enjoy a good old slasher flick.",Halloween
11,BandSAboutMovies,"A movie that doesn't understand horror, much less Halloween",5,20 October 2018,"Nearly every review of the new Halloween starts out by stating the problematic nature of the franchise. That's why the possibility of a new Halloween film with a major budget, nine years after the last abortive attempt to make one of these films, raised such hope.For the last year, we've been inundated with the assurances that these creators are people who get what makes Halloween work. This would finally be the sequel that fans had been craving since, oh, 1981.There's really no nice way to say this, so let me jump in feet first. Beyond being a movie that fundamentally doesn't comprehend what made the original Halloween such a great film, the 2018 version of Halloween is a movie with no understanding of what makes a great horror movie, either.That isn't to say there isn't a great set-up. Forty years after the 1978 Haddonfield murders (referred to as ""The Babysitter Murders,"" a nod to the film's original title), a Serial-like podcast team makes its way to the area to investigate the story and try to see both sides. The first mistake the journalists make is to show Michael Myers' mask his iconic mask. This scene is pretty chilling, as the entire yard of Smith's Grove Sanitarium rises up in chaos, dogs barking, insane men screaming, Myers just silent and not turning his back. Let's not let the logic of how two podcasters got such a crucial piece of evidence out of police custody or how any hospital in its right mind would allow this interview to happen this way get in the path of the movie.The podcasters then make their way to the fortress home of Laurie Strode, who has spent the last forty years preparing for Michael's return. If this seems like 1998's Halloween H20: 20 Years Later twenty more years later, we should be so lucky. After a quick interview in which the British duo shows that they just don't get it, Laurie kicks them out.Outside of Laurie, there isn't a single character that we get to know or care about. Her daughter is someone who has given up connecting with her. That's her one note. Her granddaughter is in a crappy relationship and wants to get to know her grandmother a little better. And that's it. Every single other person we meet - save for Dr. Sartain - is just fodder. Contrast this with the original, where we get to know Laurie, Lynda (P.J. Soles shows up so quickly here you don't even catch her, by the way) and Annie really intimately before the first hint of bloodshed. I defy you to tell me one character's motivation or reason for being beyond words on a page here. For a movie that aspires to be above and beyond the slashers of the 1980's, even the worst of those had a character you wanted to root for other than the final girl.Meanwhile, Michael has started to kill people all over again. Allyson's friend Vicky is babysitting instead of attending the school dance and she gets slaughtered. The scene where Myers is hiding in the closest was so much better effect in the trailer. Here, the way its framed, it loses any narrative punch. That's when we get to the next flaw in this film: it has no idea how to be suspenseful. There is no moment where you get that heart pumping feeling where the killer is stalking his prey, where you feel compelled to yell out words of help to the hapless victim onscreen. We saw this movie in a totally sold out environment of people ready to shout, scream and shriek. You could have heard a pin drop during this movie.Director David Gordon Green said that the first cut of the film was two hours and fifteen minutes long, with the fat of the film and entire scenes cut for pacing and length. That amazes me, as this 1 hour and 46-minute film felt like it lasted for 3 hours. There are whole characters introduced, made to feel like they'll have something to do and then discarded. You could honestly get rid of Laurie's granddaughter, friends, the high school dance, her walk home and still have the same basic story. The only reason she's in there is so that we have young babysitters for Myers' to kill. We learn nothing about her other than she's strong willed, smart and has horrible taste in men. There's no reason to root for her or hope that she survives. And even worse, her mother is presented as such a shrill that you almost want to see her pay for the way she has shut Laurie out of her life.What makes the first two Halloween films work is the atmosphere - from the first frame, you realize that something inhuman is coming after Laurie Strode. The second film just amps up the pace and makes The Shape into an inhuman force that cannot be stopped. In this film, he's just there. At no point do you feel tension from him or worry for the people he has come to kill. Things just happen. It's sloppy, slap-dash and for all the insults lobbed at the other sequels in this franchise, much closer to parts 5 and 6 than I'm sure the filmmakers would like to admit.This may be the first Halloween modern filmgoers see. And as such, there is no moment in it that points to what makes Michael Myers special. I can name several from the original, such as the moment where he watches Bob after he kills him or slowly rises up after we're sure Laurie has killed him. And the end, where his body is just suddenly gone, is the stuff of nightmares. Early in the new version, Vicky's boyfriend Dave echoes the voice of millennials, saying that Myers' five murders aren't such a big deal anymore in the grand scheme of things. I feel for anyone whose initial exposure to this franchise is with this film, one where Myers fails to do one remarkable thing or elicit one moment of fright.I've seen plenty of reviews that state that this is the best sequel in the franchise and a return to greatness. I think that those reviews were written before anyone even saw the film, preordained so that the feel good story of the return of a much-maligned franchise could come true. I tried to remove myself from the hype, to attempt to be surprised and enjoy Halloween 2018 on its own merits, but it really has little to none.The sound of Michael's breathing over the end credits signifies more than the fact that The Shape has survived. No, it means that in two years, we'll be lining up all over again, hoping that this time perhaps someone can get what seems to be such a simple idea right.",Halloween
12,Coventry,"Michael Myers, the senior citizen serial killer",5,4 April 2019,"Yours truly has a day-job in marketing, and I can tell you straightforward that the horror film-industry is nothing but just that: pure marketing trickery! Here we have a director with a good reputation (David Gordon Green; ""Joe"", ""Pineapple Express""), and the respectable lead heroine Jamie Lee Curtis, coming forward with a pretentious promotional campaign stating that their new film is a direct sequel to the almighty 1978 original. So, basically, they are saying this film is superior, while the numerous sequels and reboots of the past 40 years are utterly useless (and that includes the sequels Curtis starred in herself). It might be clever and appealing marketing, but mostly I find it disrespectful to the memory of Donald Pleasance and everyone else who was ever involved in the production of a ""Halloween"" sequel.Moreover, Gordon Green and Lee Curtis can say whatever they want; - in the end the new ""Halloween"" is also just a very prototypical and everyday horror sequel with dumb characters and extremely sadist annihilation. Fine by me, because I'm a slasher-fanatic, but then don't pretend you're better than the rest. And, for the record, I enjoyed every single and supposedly horrendous sequel in the ""Halloween"" series and even appreciated the widely exiled Rob Zombie remake.The most interesting aspect of the film is that lead characters Laurie Strode and Michael Myers are 40 years older, meaning that cute babysitter Laurie is now a grandmother herself and Michael is, at 61, a sort of senior-citizen-serial-killer. That means he should apply for a discount card to travel by bus, rather than always having to kill the driver! Laurie led a miserable life, though, largely driven by fear and paranoia. She's trying to improve her relationships with estranged daughter Karen and granddaughter Allyson, but her isolated life-style and obsession with Michael returning to finish the feud complicate her attempts. When Old Mickey escapes, from a prison transport naturally, it turns out that he still has a fetish for hacking up babysitters. The intensity of the murders and the bloodshed in ""Halloween"" is terrific. They are sick and vile, and David Gordon Green often manages to adequately build up tension and atmosphere prior to the slaughters. The script, however, is very mundane and contains too many cliches and bad twists. Michael Myers is always nearby, and he easily finds his targeted victims, as if he has a build-in GPS system. The 2 podcasters are useless and irritating characters. Besides, since when is making stupid podcasts a good enough reason to be permitted to have access to the most dangerous serial killer of the country? Even more irritating and useless is the character of Myers' doctor Sartain, supposedly Dr. Sam Loomis' successor, for whom the script has an utterly ridiculous and implausible plot twist in store. The film's main message is that absolutely nothing has changed in forty years. Michael Myers is pure evil, like Donald Pleasance has been repeating since his very first murder at age 6.",Halloween
13,michaelRokeefe,Time goes by for Michael Myers and Laurie Strode.,5,2 November 2019,"Laurie Strode's (Jamie Lee Curtis) first meeting with Madman Michael Myers, she was a teenage high school student, who barely escaped his nightmarish tirade on Halloween night four decades ago. Michael is being transferred from a deluxe mental institute to a lower security facility. He hasn't spoken for forty years. Laurie has fought her nightmares for forty years and set up plans if there happens to be another chance meeting. Michael has escaped!Shamefully overhyped, awesomely lame and possibly failing the Halloween franchise fans.",Halloween
14,Hey_Sweden,"A film I can somewhat respect, if not enjoy all that much.",6,10 June 2019,"It's been 40 years since Michael Myers went on his babysitter-killing spree, and would-be victim Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, returning to one of her best roles in style) has spent the intervening years in full-blown survivalist mode. She's got an isolated, fortified house, but has actually been PRAYING that Myers will once again come for her so she can have it out with him once and for all. This is the legacy with which Laurie's daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) have been living. And, quite naturally, Myers (played largely by actor / stuntman James Jude Courtney) once again makes a break for freedom, pursued by a doctor named Sartain (Haluk Bilginer) who's not as convinced as the late Dr. Loomis that Michael is ""pure Evil"".As you can see, this latest storyline in the series (written by Jeff Fradley, actor Danny McBride, and director David Gordon Green) pretty much ignores everything that happened in all the previous sequels. But that didn't stop the filmmakers from making constant visual references to those sequels (even ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"").This could be described as a horror film that gets some things right, and some things wrong. Green, who came from comedy (like ""Pineapple Express"", which co-starred McBride), does show himself capable of generating decent suspense, and the film DOES have some good atmosphere at times. That said, John Carpenters' 1978 classic slasher was largely gore-free, and this latest entry in the series gets pretty violent at times. Carpenter, working with his son Cody and their friend Daniel Davies, composed the score, and it's some of their best work (the three have already collaborated on three solid albums).Unfortunately, what almost sinks ""Halloween"" '18 is too many insipid characters and too much insipid dialogue. It was too hard to care about most of these people. Greer has it the worst; although she herself is an under-rated actress, she has a pretty useless role to play here.Jamie Lee is wonderful, and receives able support from fellow veteran Will Patton as one of the officers hunting down Michael. The original Michael Myers, Nick Castle, is utilized for one scene. The mostly unfamiliar cast is passable, but a kid named Jibrail Nantambu does steal the show at one point, as a kid being babysat. Bilginer is okay, but he's no Donald Pleasence, not by a long shot; the late Pleasence was the heart and soul of this series for a stretch of about 17 years.Ultimately, this is not altogether bad, but it's hardly inspired. Still, we all know yet another sequel / reboot / whatever will be inevitable at some point.Six out of 10.",Halloween
15,preppy-3,Very OK,7,26 October 2018,"A direct sequel from ""Halloween"" (1978). This takes place 40 years later. We find out the police did capture Michael Myers and he has spent the last 40 years in an institution. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is still dealing with the trauma of finding the bodies of her three dead friends. She also has a daughter and a granddaughter. Then Michael escapes and Laurie realizes it's her job to finally kill him.OK sequel. It ignores all the other sequels but there are some clever visuals that reference them. The killings are brutal and bloody but there are also some well-timed laughs. Also I was in slasher film heaven when Curtis went up against Michael. Still I'm not quite sold on it. The murders were way too unpleasant and Michael becomes just a killing machine. I've seen this all before. This is basically another Halloween sequel I'll never see again. Still it's worth a look for fans.",Halloween

Laurie(Lee Curtis, sympathetic as the PTSD-ridden survivor, and badass in having gone full Sarah Connor), has spent all that time preparing. She's modified her home to ensure she'll never again be the victim of a physical assault, as she was over 30 years prior. Flood lights, an isolated location where she can see someone coming from far away, bolts and locks on her doors, and last but not least, guns and the training that go with. However, will she be able to protect her estranged daughter(Greer, who's long since decided not to fear the attacker) and granddaughter(who tries to balance having positive relationships with both, something that seems impossible)?No other sequel to the original, before this, has felt like it deserves to be considered one(since Season of the Witch is a spin-off). This has it(not ""him"") stalk, as it should. We see increases to the body count, and the level and detail of violence, without feeling like a Friday the 13th clone(which is part of the problem with other entries in this series). More of the time, corpses are discovered, rather than us seeing a lot of kills on screen(something that can easily have a numbing effect on the viewer). It was a wise decision to ignore all but the 1978 film. Others have said that too much time is spent away from the Strode family, especially its deeply compelling matriarch. I found those scenes draining(as they should be, and were meant to), and we cannot have the confrontation before the climax. ""Too much time devoted to teenagers and their mundane problems""? That's true to form. It may just have bothered you less when you first met Michael Myers. Where do I stand on ""the majority of the characters in this are there to be taken out, and they're bland and unlikeable""? I empathised with 90% of them, and found them interesting enough... your mileage may vary.In addition to what I've already mentioned, there is a moderate amount of strong language, some sexuality, and brief nudity in this. I recommend this to any fan of Carpenter's iconic movie. I welcome this getting followed up on. I am ecstatic to report, Halloween is terrifying. The Boogeyman has finally returned. 8/10",Halloween

Solid (yet again an unnecessary) sequel to the iconic horror classic 40 years after masked maniac Michael Myers (Courtney and Castle doing double-duty here) was captured and confined to a prison for his holiday killing spree follows suit with his last living victim Laurie Strode (stoic mess Curtis) lying in wait for the inevitable - his escape and hell-bent return to Haddonfield to finish what he started. Filmmaker David Gordon Green, who collaborated on the screenplay with partners-in-crime Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley, abides by the formula (stupid teens/adults make excellent body count fodder) and provides echoes of its original masterpiece (even its director John Carpenter is back riffing on his creepy soundtrack with Daniel A. Davies and his son Cody) with skill and aplomb (and oh yeah ,eschewing the franchise's other films altogether in an elaborate Jedi Mind Trick!)",Halloween
18,neil-476,Watch it for Jamie Lee Curtis,7,30 October 2018,"40 years after Michael Myers committed multiple murders, he escapes and returns to Haddonfield. Laurie Strode, the terrorised survivor of those killings has led a life emotionally crippled my her experience. Estranged from the daughter she tried to train to be a warrior/survivor, but who regards her as a fruitcake, she lives as a hermit in a cabin with a hidden and heavily armed panic room basement. Perhaps this is just as well...John Carpenter's original movie was a classic, but it annoyed me. The reason it annoyed me was Michael Myers. Yes, so he's the boogeyman. I get that. But either he's supernatural or not. If he's supernatural then there should be something acknowledging that, preferably giving a little explanation. But there wasn't. And if he's not supernatural then, I'm sorry, but he should be dead.Anyway, here he is again, surviving the most horrific injuries without any apparent signs of trauma, as he goes about wholesale indiscriminate slaughter - indeed, slaughter which is substantially more wholesale and indiscriminate than it was 40 years ago. He is no longer a disturbed individual who becomes the bogeyman, he is just a slaughter machine.For those who watch this sort of film for the murders, they are well stage but there probably won't be quite enough of them for you and they probably won't be quite graphic enough for you.The characters are mostly quite weak. We are shown a lot of Laurie's teenage granddaughter - she is the character we are meant to root for. Then she behaves really unpleasantly towards one f her friends, and I lost all sympathy for her (not that I wished slaughter upon her, but even so...).Jamie Lee Curtis, revisiting Laurie 40 years later, is fabulous. As a teenager, Laurie wasn't a victim. As a woman in late middle age, she still isn't a victim. Damaged - no question. But part of her as been yearning for a rematch with Michael so that she can deliver payback. Laurie, and the showdown, are the best bits of a film which doesn't quite hit what it was aiming for.",Halloween
19,ferguson-6,fitting forty year follow up,7,19 October 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. I believe the term is 'full circle'. It was 1978, and I vividly recall waiting anxiously for the opening night start of John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN. Now, 40 years later, I've just watched what is likely (hopefully!) the final entry of a franchise that spans between 9 and 12 movies, depending on which ones you count (although, apparently we are only supposed to count the first one and this latest). Carpenter's original film gave us the backstory of 6 year old Michael Myers killing his sister Judith in 1963, and subsequently being confined to a sanitarium before showing up on All Hallows Eve in 1978 for what is now referred to as The Babysitter Murders.Writer/director David Gordon Green (STRONGER, 2017) and co-writers Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley make it clear from the start that this is a direct sequel (ignore the others!) to the 1978 original, although having a sequel and its original share the same title is itself a bit confusing. For anyone unfamiliar with Carpenter's original classic (the one that kicked off an entire genre of slasher films), the filmmakers offer up a couple of fame-seeking British podcasters (Rhian Rees, Jefferson Hall) to spell out the history and gory details of Michael Myers and Haddonfield, Illinois. Michael has been institutionalized for four decades, never uttering a single word to his doctors ... neither the now-deceased Dr. Loomis nor his protégé Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer mimicking some of Donald Pleasance's oratory style). Thanks to a not-unexpected bus wreck, and the amateurish prank of the podcasters, Michael Myers is reunited with his William Shatner mask (looking a bit rough these days) and sets off to kill innocents and track down his nemesis, Laurie Strode.The challenges of filmmakers in 2018 versus those in 1978 aren't just limited to disposing of podcasters and teenager's cell phones. They must also be cautious about treating women as victims, and here Laurie Strode is anything but. She has spent these years preparing herself and training her now-grown daughter Karen (Judy Greer) what to do once (not if) Michael Myers returns. Mother and daughter are now somewhat estranged, connected mostly by Laurie's granddaughter Allyson (newcomer Andi Matichak). It's kind of clever how the filmmakers empower the three generations so that together they may face off against the evil that has haunted their family for so many years.The film has a retro 1970's look and feel, and it is well-served as a tribute/follow-up to the original. Some familiar shots are mirrored and references to the original are noted through the dialogue ... though some of the humor seems a bit forced (specifically young Jibrail Nantambu who is being babysat). The opening credit sequence makes good use of the same font and color scheme from 40 years ago, and the rotten jack-o-lantern coming back to life is a nice touch.The return of Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie is what completes this haunting circle. Carpenter's HALLOWEEN was her big screen debut, and though she still tends to go over the-top at times, this obviously would not have worked without the daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. In fact, this story is mostly focused on the psychology of Laurie and her PTSD, as we never learn much about what makes Michael Myers do what he does. Others returning from the original film include Nick Castle as The Shape (though James Jude Courtney shares the role this time), and PJ Soles in an all-too-brief and quite memorable appearance. As a veteran cop, and described as the first officer on the scene 40 years ago, Will Patton's character appears to want to be anywhere but where he is (side note: Mr. Patton looks almost identical to Paul Simon these days).Huge carving knives gleaming (despite the low light) make several appearances, and many of Michael's grisly murders are handled off camera. But don't mistake that for a lack of violence or gore - there is an abundance. Keep in mind that the film is positioned as a direct sequel to the 1978 film, and fans of that classic should be quite satisfied. Even the iconic 1978 theme song is re-worked by John Carpenter, his grandson Cody Carpenter and musician Daniel A Davies. The recognizable notes are a bit slower and bulked up through synth. As with most horror films, it would be pretty easy to point out the flaws, inconsistencies and necessary assumptions, but it's one of the few that actually works if you avoid thinking too much and just ""enjoy"" the mythology and horror.",Halloween
20,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly enjoyable and engaging reboot,8,10 November 2018,"Still in captivity from his previous rampage, the maniac is spurned on by news of his escaped target still being alive to track her and her estranged family, also living in the same town, to escape and target her on Halloween night forcing her to use her years of survival skills to stop him.This serves as a solid and highly enjoyable entry in the series. One of the strongest aspects presents here is the strong rewriting of the story that offers a fine setup for what's to come in the film. The ignoring of the sequels allows this one to offer up a decent reboot of the storyline where the events that have taken place here have a stellar series of resolutions and payouts, from the emotional toll the events in the past have taken on her and the strained relationship everybody has with each other in the family which helps propel this one along. Coming in conjunction with the events at the asylum where they find him in the opening to the later scenes at the compound where it's fully revealed how psychotic she has become in the interim, the film provides this setup quite nicely and provides the backbone for the slasher film roots. These scenes here are quite fun, ranging from the first attack at the remote gas-station where he takes out the two doing the TV show on the case to the rampage across the town taking out the stragglers around town setting up the big rampage at the end where he comes across the babysitter in the house and then leads him back to the trap-filled house at the end which has some rather enjoyable straightforward stalker action for these types of scenarios. These here hold it up over the film's few problems. The main issue to be had here is the film really doesn't seem all that interested in making the side-characters that interesting before the rampage comes. There's a complete lack of information given about who the rest of the family is or their friends, leaving a lot of the middle to feel pretty lame and just not that interesting, especially when it dives into petty teen problems as not only are those utterly uninteresting but then to have them committed by these uninteresting people. That also makes the middle portion of this one leading into the finale feel way too sloppy and disjointed as it deals with the revelation that he's come back to the town as there are so many scenes going back-and-forth to the various figures in his way which really feel jumbled and disorganized as it tends to go through some rather confusing moments. As well, the other real problematic issue here is the fact that there's just no sense of closure or suspense in why he's targeting the family since there's no real point as for why they're being targeted. The lack of real build-up here is quite disappointing as the house ambush is just a blur compared to the rest of the film and just ends abruptly due to the lack of build-up, and all-told really brings this one down somewhat.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Halloween
21,trashgang,"the true follow-up, but a bit over the top with Strode's house",6,16 January 2019,"Finally, after 40 years the one and only follow-up of the original Halloween (1978). The makers told us, with back-up of John Carpenter, forget the other flicks in the sequel, this is the one and only true story. So a hype was created and geeks all over the world praised this as the horror flick of 2018.With the opening titles being done in yellow and the pumpkin it truly gave us a feeling of this was made in the heydays of slashers. So far so good, but it do takes almost 30 minutes before the first thing go wrong. The visit of journalists to Michael at the asylum and showing him the mask, I didn't liked it, what does it add towards the flick, towards the story?The restroom, it's where things really starts and going back to Haddonfield made the viewer waiting for the massacre starting allover again. Michael does what he does best, mayhem at Halloween but sadly it never really becomes as frightening as the original one. The 1978 version didn't had one drip of blood and still wowadays people are afraid to see it. The score, the way Michael moves, it's that what made the original a horror and a classic, remember the ghost point of view...Another thing I found over the top is the house of Laurie Strode. All the traps made and whatever she's does to kill Michael is exaggerated which doesn't add towarrds the horror.Still, way better than most sequels made and worth seeing but to say it's better than the Rob zombie remakes, naaa I dare not.

Well what did not work. So thin on story and characters. Halloween is so thin on a story that the only way Michael Myers can can find Laurie is by an unbelievable plot twist of the psychiatrist kills a cop and drives Michael to the house. Oh really, so lame. Even lamer, Michael escapes by another psyh ward transfer so so again, no original. Cut out all the other Halloween story lines and we got more the same old, same old which does not perform the slow burn turn the horror up notch by notch formula of the other Halloweens. There is a sisterhood empowerment characters sub story. Laurie has turned into a Ted Nuggent, N R A character who rambles, and is annoying. The audience is suppose to like the victims. No attachment with the gruff, unlikable Laurie character. All the guys in the film are lame and weak beta males, and or just clueless guys. Whinny, whimpering, irritating characters the viewers just hate. Again,there is no attachment to the characters. You need the alpha male character who gets killed for the false hope narrative. The jerk with the loud shirt who always dies the worst. The shrink is a narrator about Michael which was missing. No friendship with the younger people which builds a bond with the audience. Michael has to be like 80 by now, I mean the scare factor is not believable. All you have is the Laurie character who reminds the viewer of the over powering mother in the movie psycho! The trap at the end like really lame. Waiting for all this build up for that nothing ending, and or lack of ending. 5 out of 10 scares.",Halloween
23,deloudelouvain,Still good enough for me.,7,14 January 2019,"First I was skeptical if we needed another Halloween movie after it started brilliantly 40 years ago. There's been already so much sequels that at one point you have to call it quits. But in all fairness this sequel isn't bad at all. It's the typical Michael Myers slashing everybody up movie so if you're not up for that then just pass on this one. How many times can Michael Myers escape? Well, one more time obviously. I know that sounds ridiculous, but for me it worked once again. There are enough thrills to keep it interesting so it's fine to me. When you see how Jamie Lee Curtis aged then you realise how long it's been since the first Halloween. But after this one this time I think when can close a chapter. The Halloween fans will be pleased with this sequel, the others maybe not.",Halloween
24,thesar-2,"H40: This Time, It's Personal",8,19 October 2018,"Actually, it's always personal.When we left the theatre, a friend commented that Michael was the most brutal in this one. I disagreed. Despite my hatred for Rob Zombie's Halloween II (2009, aka H2,) THAT version of Michael Myers was the most brutal.That said, this updated version was thoroughly brutal, realistic and frightening. He felt the most real and even believable for the age he was supposed to be. (I estimate: 61.) And the film was just as ruthless and genuine as Michael.Once again, in the FOURTH reboot of the series (following Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, Halloween: H20 and Rob Zombie's Halloween (2007),) we're asked to forget some sequels. Make that ALL of them, including the original Halloween II in 1981. So, just know: only the original in 1978 and this one, exactly 40 years later, exist in this timeline.Michael's been in lockup for forty years for killing five people on October 31, 1978 and once again is scheduled on Halloween (like in #4) to be transported to another jail. He, gasp!, escapes to kill and this time (like in #7,) the serial killer aka The Boogeyman & The Shape's original surviving victim, Laurie Strode, is ready!I don't want to give away too much, and it would be far too easy to guess at what this movie is about and how it will play out. But, let me tell you this: it has absolute twists and turns and events I never saw coming. I was amazed on how much the movie kept surprising me and amped up the suspense.I was a little thrown off by how MUCH exposition was given, however. I mean, sure, there are people out there who haven't seen the original; I suspect there are three people left, but enough to make it plural. Still, they could've toned down on how much they had to rehash verbally or visually from the original.On a technical side, the film had brilliant moments of filming and keeping us guessing at where Michael was in the background - IF he was there, but then it also had far too many close-ups. Mostly in the first half, I was feeling claustrophobic on how close the camera was to every object and especially faces.That all said, it had JUST enough homages to Parts 1-3 (maybe more than I could catch in this first of many inevitable viewings) to satisfy diehard fans, like myself. Recently, I've been going through the first 10 movies in order, with part 1 twice since I got a chance to finally see it in theatres for its 40th Anniversary a couple of nights ago and my first time on the big screen and some of them overdid the tributes to the series to the max. This film, just perfect. And the part III one was awesome to catch.I had a feeling this one would be one of the best and I was spot on. In fact, with just one viewing under my belt, I'd proclaim this was the best Halloween movie since #1. It was an absolute joy to see, especially on how I felt they respected the characters and took them to a sincere 2018 setting. Well done, and I cannot wait to see this again!***Final thoughts: Case in point from my point above, my bartender prior to the screening said to me, as I was leaving to go into the theatre: ""Well, enjoy the movie! I have never seen the original."" I gave him a disbelieving look.""I'm just 22!"" he explained. ""I do want to see it, but can never find it online. Some movies, like Super Troopers, you can never find online unless you buy the DVD.""I thought about it, and he's probably right (without actually verifying it now, haha, as I type this review.) When I was younger, this movie was always on TV. Cable and regular TV. And most of us owned the VHS, especially since it was usually only $5 brand new.Strange on how easily it was available when I was younger and now, so hard to find. Probably a strategy to get people to buy it more out of desperation to see what the big deal is.Considering the original's still my all-time favorite horror movie, I'd say it's worth seeking out. No matter the method of finding and owning it is.",Halloween
25,FeastMode,my notes,2,27 July 2019,"The amount of stupidity in this movie is astonishing. i laughed so hard at so many parts. it's not scary and it's really really dumb. they seem like they wanted to capture the feel of the originals. if part of that was using old horror movie absurd logic and idiocy, they succeeded. this movie is poorly made on so many levels. the positives: musical score was great, and it seemed relatively competent for a while, investing me in the story before showing its true face. hilariocity score = 8/10 (1 viewing)

bro. just bro. there was a scene where he stomped a guys face to smithereens, and in the next shot his face was in tact with his brains coming out of the top. i went back to confirm, in the original shot his entire head was liquefied lmao.apparently cop cars in that town have super tinted windows where even if the light is on inside the car, you can't see anything. except the glowing eye- and mouth-holes of the severed head inside the car. HOW?!?! he opens the door and you can clearly see everything well lit in the car. plus the way he had the flashlight in dude's severed head, he would have had to remove the brain, tongue and all tissue from his head. he looked like he did it with surgical precision.the dad discovered said dead cops because he was chilling outside. just hanging out. when there is a murderer on the loose. when the grandma is inside turning off all the lights. scolding her daughter for having the light on. but hanging out outside? no problem.and the best part? the ""twist"" rofl rofl. the mom tells the grandma about the underground layer being ""a cage."" grandma responds it's not a cage. later the daughter gets there, goes underground, and for some random reason cries ""i'm in a cage."" ..... ....... like..... for real? once michael meyers is down there, they close the bars on the entrance and light the room on fire to kill him. the mom tells the daughter ""it's not a cage, it's a trap!"" lolololololololololololololololol. i yelled OMG. also, once you block the entrance with bars, it actually kind of is a cage right? smh horrendous. oh and right before that, the grandma said ""happy halloween michael"" and stabbed him. just wow",Halloween
26,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A seemingly never ending franchise gets another going over,4,10 July 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSince his murderous spree one Halloween night, Michael Myers has spent the past forty years in a secure psychiatric facility, with no efforts to understand or rehabilitate him coming to anything. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the teenager who fought him off all those years ago, has grown into a hardened, steely older woman, determined to teach her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Dana (Rhian Rees) to fight back to stay safe. This comes in handy one night when the monster escapes one night, returning to the town of Haddonfield to re-enact his murderous rampage.When emerging director John Carpenter made the low budget Halloween in 1978, he probably didn't expect that much to come of it. Looking like a home made movie by today's standards, it's lucky he got the fundamental stuff right to keep it alive in people's memory, namely the dark, forboding sense of fear and tension. While this cemented it as the horror classic that it was, it also made it possibly the most overdone franchise of all time, with a slew of sequels, a remake (that had it's own sequel!) and now this latest 'reboot' to mark its fortieth anniversary!In spite of those aforementioned sequels, this completely disregards them and starts the story from scratch, with Michael having been securely detained ever since the events in 1978, and now re-escaping as an older, stronger killer. And so it's fitting that surviving teenager Laurie is now older herself, a sort of Sarah Connor type hard woman, with her own family who has lived for the day he escaped so she could kill him! This is a fairly interesting angle in itself, with potential for expansion, but none of it ever develops into anything truly tense or scary, or any real sense of danger.They obviously felt it had a strong enough fan base that would want to see a fortieth anniversary reboot, but this is a series that has truly exhausted every bit of its appeal, no matter how long they leave it between new instalments, with a seemingly indestructible Michael Myers always returning no matter what fate befalls him in the last episode. Besides some creative plot points, there are no surprises here and nothing beats the original. **",Halloween
27,MOscarbradley,More of a remake than a sequel,5,29 October 2019,"Yep, it's October 31st but 40 years later and Michael Meyers has escaped, (again). Jamie Lee Curtis is now the grandmother and naturally she's mad, bad and dangerous to know, spouting cliches by the dozen, but this ""Halloween"" is more of a remake that a sequel to Carpenter's masterpiece so it's basically business as usual. For a film like this to work we don't really need surprises but we do need shocks and unfortunately David Gordon Greeen doesn't seem to be the man to deliver them.Carpenter had the knack of scaring the living daylights out of us, mainly by a judicious use of the widescreen; Green just pours on the bloodletting. That said, this is still one of the better films in the franchise; a little bit of what we already know certainly comes in handy. Unfortunately, apart from Curtis no-one else makes much of an impact and it's sad to see Will Patton wasted as an over-the-hill policeman. What's even sadder is there's two more movies in the pipeline.",Halloween
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"While not quite as good as 'Halloween (1978)', this is still a painfully violent and generally entertaining slasher.",7,21 October 2018,"'Halloween (2018)' is the belated sequel to 'Halloween (1978)' that ignores 'Halloween II (1981)', 'Halloween II (2009)', 'Halloween (2007)', too, and every 'Halloween' in-between. Look, you could write a whole think piece about why the title is bad, in fact I have, but the more important thing is the quality of the film itself. Surprisingly, it's not bad; it's not bad at all. See, where reports of the picture being a straight-up comedy that removes all reference to the main thesis of the first feature - that Michael Myers is the Boogeyman and that you can't kill the Boogeyman - had me worried and doubting its quality or even competence, the movie itself puts all those worries to rest and proves that you can't judge a book by its cover (or its bad title). All I'm saying is that every reported decision made it seem like David Gordon Green and co were taking the story in the wrong direction, especially since this is being billed as the 'true successor' to John Carpenter's 1978 classic. However, the final result is something very much in keeping with that original picture (and perhaps even its most immediate sequel, even if it's never referenced and perhaps causes a couple of issues with the new, series rewriting backstory) and it clearly has a reverence for it - though, this does occasionally lead to some 'fan service' that does seem slightly out of place. After a slightly rocky start, the piece becomes a rather compelling and enjoyable time that often makes you squirm in your seat thanks to the revamped brutality of its antagonist. Here, Michael Myers - or, The Shape - truly is a frightening foe. This is mainly because of his unrelenting, indiscriminate blood-lust and the shocking, painful way in which it is presented. He just kills anyone who gets in his path; men, women and children. The violence is shown in an impactful, gruesome and generally wince-inducing way and it almost makes you want to look away - almost. It's not like it's way too extreme, rather that it's appropriate for what's happening. When someone is hurt, you feel it; when they're killed, it's almost upsetting. Although some silly moments slip into the fray, including a particularly absurd and out-of-character kill late on, most of the carnage is certifiably nasty and it makes you dread The Shape's next inevitable deadly encounter. It's actually refreshing to see violence portrayed in this way, especially as it's always consequential and never feels like we're even close to 'rooting for' the killer (which can happen in some Slasher fare). Plus, a man with a knife really is a scary thing and this knows it; it doesn't worry about 'the inventiveness of kills' or anything like that. The only real downside to Michael's representation is that his killings come across as purely random and, while that is quite unsettling, it doesn't line up with the 'target choosing' sort of stuff we see in the first film and sometimes makes for an aimless vibe. This is especially true of the finale, in which Michael and Laurie face off, as it seems as though the former simply stumbles across the later by chance rather than fate, as is supposed to be the case (though you could argue that the two are intertwined). Still, that sequence is pretty crowd-pleasing. Speaking of Laurie, I found her character to be a rather good representation of trauma. I thought that Curtis did a good job of portraying an older, harder survivor and that the family dynamic was a rather well-conceived one. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem as though she's in it enough - or, at least, the flick doesn't focus enough on her character. Even her granddaughter doesn't get enough screen-time, and she's the second closest thing to a protagonist we get. The story in general is a bit weak, as it both follows a similar path to the original but also feels very unfocused and coincidental. There's quite a bit of odd exposition, too, and a particular plot-point which threatens to head in a direction that, if it had continued on that path, would've almost made me want to walk out. Luckily, it didn't go the way it looked as though it would and was resolved quickly enough so that it was only stupid, not movie-ruining. I'll just quickly touch on the 'comedy'. While there are certainly moments that feel out of place, too long and sometimes tonally jarring, most of the humour is, in fact, just witty writing used to make you care about characters that sometimes only have one or two scenes before they meet their end at the hands of the Boogeyman. This means that, for the most part, we care about everyone killed and there aren't really any moments that are so out of touch that they take you - or, at least, me - out of a particular scene. Overall, I really enjoyed 'Halloween (2018)'. Even though it certainly isn't quite as good as 'Halloween (1978)', it generally swaps out suspense (Michael is on-screen a lot more and he doesn't tend to stalk his victims for that long before he makes the kill) for visceral violence and I think that's the main thing that it has improved upon. I do wish we had the suspense of the first with the violence of this one, though, as that could've been a truly gruelling and scary film; one of the main issues with Carpenter's genre-defining piece is that the kills don't really hold up all that well outside of the context of the film itself (looking back, I mean). This new entry into the series isn't as tight and, while it's sometimes teeth-clenching, it's not scary. Plus, if a sequel comes along, and I suspect it will, it will severely dampen this one's ending. I had a good time with the film, though, and I was on the edge of my seat by its end. 7/10",Halloween
29,bowmanblue,"Wow, actually pretty good",7,26 January 2021,"Okay, I should point out that I'm - probably - the only horror fan in the world that just doesn't 'get' the original 'Halloween.' I've watched it a fair few times and it just leaves me cold (and bored). In fact, I actually even preferred the, much maligned, 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' or the Rob Zombie remake to the 1979 version (please don't hate me). Therefore, my hopes were hardly high for this weird sequel/reboot/re-imagining. Whatever it is.So, because I was never into the whole 'Halloween' franchise when it came to following serial killer 'Michael Myers' I'm not really fussed as to where and how this one fits in. I hear it's a remake of the sequel to the original, thus erasing other sequels - or something. I don't care.On the off-chance you know even less about the franchise than I do, Michael Myers is a - possibly supernatural - masked serial killer who has a love for knifing babysitters while they work. Back in the seventies, he stalked and very nearly killed young Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Now, in present day, she's a grandmother who's been left traumatised by her brush with the bogeyman all those decades ago.Overall, what you get here is nothing new. It's a 'slasher' flick - killer picks off one teen/cast member after the next, finally facing off against the star. Nothing new to see here. And it would probably would be quite forgettable if it wasn't for Jamie Lee Curtis herself. It's rare that I say a film is 100% carried on the shoulders by its star, but her performance here is just superb. Maybe it's because - in modern cinema - our on-screen heroes are normally pretty perfect to start with. Not here. She's a complete mess, suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome and drinking herself to death even before Myers can get to her. She's living as a 'prepper' hermit, convinced that Myers will one day return for her and try and finish what he started. And - guess what - he finally finds a way to break out of his secure institution and find his way 'home.'About the only thing that felt a bit 'odd' to me was seeing Michael Myers without his mask. I know it's a strange thing to say from someone who doesn't really care that much about the series, but I'm so used to ONLY seeing the killer all masked up that even just catching glimpses of the man under the mask just felt, well, odd.Whether you approve of remaking a franchise midway or not, this one deserves a watch if you're a horror fan as Jamie Lee Curtis really does bring something new to the (modern) genre. I wonder if they could 'reboot' 'Aliens' after the second film too and do the same for Lt Ripley?",Halloween
30,ThomasDrufke,The Final Showdown,8,21 October 2018,"40 years after Michael Myers terrorized audiences, which continued on for decades in numerous panned films, he returns in the newest reboot/sequel/requel/reimagining/ but ultimately the true follow up to the 1978 original film. And although i can understand where some people may be slightly disappointed because it doesn't necessarily deviate from what we've seen before nor reinvent the slasher genre, but it's nonetheless effective.Michael Myers has never been more terrifying and his brutality has been taken to an all new level. And I also love the fact that this was essentially Laurie Strode turning into Sarah Connor from Terminator 2. I could have actually used more of her and Michael's dynamic in this one, instead we get a perfectly fine subplot with her daughter and granddaughter. Both of which carry their own when called upon, even if some other side characters don't nearly do as much to make their screentime worth it (i.e. some of Allyson's friends). But as many people have said, the idea that side characters are introduced merely to be killed by the main villain has been a horror trope for decades, so I can't really fault this film for that.Though, I will say that there's a make or break scene that happens at the beginning of the third act that felt like a twist for a twists sake and without much merit. So if that scene pulls you out of it, I can understand. Fortunately, I was brought back in not much later by a thrilling final showdown as Strode vs. Myers took on a whole new level of brilliance. Fun, at times scary, and even hilarious in moments, this is the sequel to the 78' Halloween we've always deserved but never thought we would get.8.4/10",Halloween

32,MLDinTN,Jamie Lee looking cra cra,6,26 May 2019,"The most noticable thing about this movie is Jamie Lee Curtis is looking cra cra with that long , stringy gray hair. The plot is Michael is being transferred and of course as usual it's on Halloween. The bus flips and he escapes and goes on a killing spree. In this version, the killing is pretty gory. Lots of blood and knives through heads. And people don't escape once Michael gets his hands on them. What I didn't get is why didn't the police cancel trick or treating with a serial killer on the loose. And why didn't they warn the public about Micheal. And why when there is a bunch of people slaughtered at a gas station, the whole town is not talking about it but still going about Halloween as usual. Then there is the twist of the doctor going cra cra by killing the cop because he can't stand to see Michael die, too much in science would be lost. The tricked out house at the end was cool. Laurie had set all kinds of traps for Michael and one supposedly worked until they decide to make another sequel.FINAL VERDICT: Fun film for what it is.",Halloween
33,Cineanalyst,Shapeless Gaze,3,6 December 2019,"The original ""Halloween"" (1978) is a consummate slasher film for a simple reason, which nonetheless appears to elude some, including those making its numerous sequels and, now, this retconned direct follow-up. The first film worked because of the role of the camera. The horror was based in the control of its gaze. The jump scare was one manifestation of this, and the effectiveness of the score another. This 2018 adulteration abandons that and so the jump scares are ineffectual and, to fill in the gaps, listless filler is added to Carpenter's original musical masterpiece. It's franchise engineering lacking an identity for the camera; the only frightening thing about it is its success at the box office, which means the sequels will keep coming. This bogeyman truly cannot be stopped.As per Film Theory 101, the spectator (that is, we, the audience) shares their gaze with that of the camera; we see what the camera sees. In turn, the camera's gaze may be associated with that of another character, or multiple characters, or it may be omniscient or be something of a character or spectator itself. The 1978 film is a struggle for that gaze between two characters, Michael Myers and Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). The camera is first and primarily linked through the eyes of Michael, which is established in the opening point-of-view shot where he kills his sister. (Note in the replaying of this shot in this sequel how different it is from any of the new footage.) Indeed, the camera sharing his perspective is only interrupted when his mask is removed, and he is revealed to be a child. Throughout the rest of the picture, he wears a mask to avoid a repeat of his being gazed upon, while he fights for the control to gaze upon others. In effect, the cinematic gaze becomes a murderous, penetrating, knife-wielding Shape. And why not? That's why we watched it, to see the madman's killing spree.Even more clever, perhaps, was that the film, then, began sharing the gaze with Laurie. The shifts between the perspectives of these two characters created the jump scares, and, as underscored by the music, was responsible for all of the actual horror--not merely the gory blood splatter. There was also a psycho-sexual dimension to all of this, as Michael continually hunted sexually-promiscuous teenagers, like his sister, while masking his own incestuous disgust, and Laurie, the virgin, combating his gaze by seeking to unmask him.So, what does this 2018 movie do, then? The opening scene seemed promising, as Myers resisted the gaze by us never getting a good look at his unmasked face, but from there we get just about the most boring camera perspective imaginable: the usual, hapless unrestricted variation untied to any character or intelligent aesthetic--shapeless. It's a picture intrigued by characters--four this time--but that shares its gaze with none of them. Instead, the spectator is supposed to be content gazing upon them as much of the movie is concerned with backstory. Basically, we're in the position of the inept podcasters pontificating rubbish about character psychologies and bogeyman mythology.Later, we get stupid character and plot twists, as well as a pathetic rehashing of scenes from the first film. Take the long tracking shots of Myers's murders; they're all the more unnerving in the original because the gaze is through his eyes, but here it's merely a glazed look with no particular direction or interest and imbued with no particular character. Consequently, the sexual pathology is severely sacrificed, too. This is a ""Halloween"" for the age of franchise filmmaking: tiresome mythologies and mind-numbing backstories based around likable actors and characters, scary monsters turned unkillable terminators pitted against tough, crafty (super)heroes. It has no soul; it's pure evil.",Halloween
34,gbill-74877,Could have been better,6,2 September 2019,"There seems to be only so many places films in this genre can go, and while this one is serviceable, the direction it takes is predictable and not all that satisfying, at least to me. The whole research/psychoanalysis of Michael Myers isn't developed, and the way he escapes has been seen in countless movies. I liked seeing Jamie Lee Curtis at age 60, but her character and her house are taken to such an extreme (except the door with the glass windows on it, lol) that we see how it will play out early on. The stupid bits of dialogue don't help (""aw, I got peanut butter on my penis""). Still, there is tension in the relentless killing, and the scenes at the accident site with the child, and later in the bathroom with the couple are suitably gripping. Could have been much better with a smarter script.",Halloween

This is an odd film because it's not really a remake. It does in fact ignore all the other movies except the original. I really did think ""Halloween"" had better movies than something like ""Friday The 13th"" or especially ""Leprechaun"". The plot's pretty basic, with Michael having been in prison for 40 years. Dang, he has aged well!I love how we see glimpses of his face, but never all of it. It starts off great by showing this scene where people try to get him to talk. Jamie Lee Curtis is probably the best thing in the movie. There's this little kid who gets in some great laughs too. It all leads up to this very smart climax.

Jamie Lee Curtis packs in a career highlight as Laurie Strode, a role she originated forty years ago, and their is a grounded comfort in her performance, as well as a willingness to be bold and daring.Michael Myers is by far one of the most heart pounding horror villains, and he is so utterly unpredictable in this film that it kept me constantly at the edge of my seat. The very first on screen death let's us know that this film is taking no shortcuts, and all the risks.Phenomenal horror/thriller.

38,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,14 January 2019,"HalloweenThe scariest Jack-o'-lanterns can be found on front porches 2-weeks after Halloween.Thankfully the gourds in this horror movie are fungus free and prime for carving up.When Michael Myers escapes from custody on the anniversary of his 1978 killing spree, the only survivor of those attacks Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) readies her daughter (Judy Greer) and granddaughter (Andi Matichak) for the forthcoming confrontation. And this time around, instead of a scared babysitter, the knife wielding Michael is going to find a scorned woman with a score to settle.Set after the events in John Carpenter's original, this stylish sequel co-written by Danny McBride pays homage to the prototype in a plethora of ingenious ways. However, this mildly gory tribute comes with a serious dosage of oddball comedy that often undermines the massacres.Moreover, if Michael Myers loves stabbing people in costumes so much he should attend a cosplay convention.

39,Bored_Dragon,It's finally over,6,2 August 2019,"The eleventh installment of the ""Halloween"" franchise completely ignores all previous films and builds directly on the original from 1978, but at the same time, it is full of ""Easter egg"" references to each of the prequels, even to ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"", which has nothing to do with Michael Myers or the rest of the franchise. With this movie, the franchise got the fourth timeline. The original timeline consists of films from the first to the sixth, with the exception of the aforementioned third. The seventh, ""H20"" ignored movies from the fourth to the sixth and created a second timeline, consisting of the first two films, ""H20"" and ""Resurrection."" Rob Zombie opened the third with his two reboot films from 2007 and 2009, and now we have the fourth one made up of the original movie and this one.This is a well-crafted slasher-horror, which in itself has no major flaws and, viewed within its timeline, is a worthy successor to the original film. But if you, like me, have watched all ten films that preceded it, this is just additional pouring sand in the desert, because almost everything this film brings has already been seen, which makes it extremely boring.If you are a fan, well acquainted with the entire franchise, you can find satisfaction in searching for ""Easter eggs"" and identifying references to previous films. I particularly liked that in this movie Jamie Lee Curtis and Myers repeatedly find themselves in situations similar to those in the first movie, but in reversed roles.If you have not yet watched the ""Halloween"" franchise, I advise you not to watch everything, but to follow one timeline. As, in my opinion, ""H20"" is the best in the franchise, I suggest the following:Halloween (1978),
Halloween II (1981),
Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998).Then you could watch this one and, in the end, only the first reboot by Rob Zombie.6/10",Halloween

Directing was pretty solid - this movie barely dragged and was pretty entertaining from start till finish.Overall, ""Halloween"" (2018) is definitely a pretty good movie to see it once. But i'm sure i won't return to see it twice. I did its job and that's that. There are also many question that you will start thinking during this movie that raises from its plot - like you have to ask yourself a question of how did Michael learned to drive a car after spending his whole life in prison?

41,ironhorse_iv,2018's 'Halloween' was a decent horror movie. It was a cut above the rest. Michael Myers finally comes home.,7,31 October 2018,"1978's horror film 'Halloween' was a pretty good low budget independent slasher movie directed/scored by John Carpenter. However, the follow-ups that came after, fail to gain the same critical success as the first movie. It wasn't until 2018, that a sequel directed by David Gordon Green, also known as 'Halloween', finally got the respect, it deserve. Set 40 years after the original film, the plot follows Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) once again, as she prepares to face the masked Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney and Nick Castle), when he returns to Haddonfield, Illinois, after his last killing spree on Halloween night. Without spoiling too much of the film, while, this movie got mostly praise from diehards and critics for its well balance approach to the source material, by not swaying too far from it, while, also subverting enough expectations to stand on its own with the use of suspense and brutal action, the flick still hit some controversies roadblock with some viewers. Mostly with those, unhappy that the film recon all the previous sequels and it's establish, yet inconsistent lore. Some good examples was taking away the idea that Laurie was related to the Myers family. Look, I get that, the reveal from 1981's 'Halloween 2' took away the menacing unknown motive that made Michael such an effective mysterious villain to some, but I felt that it gave a really good reason for him to predatory stalk Laurie in the first movie & continue to kill people around her in the follow ups. In this movie, Michael goes to the town with no clear target in mind and proceeds on a random, unrelated killing spree that for the most part, doesn't factor, much to the main plot, serving much like filler. Look, I get that he might do this, to service some type of crazy abnormal psychological gratification, hints why he is a mental ward for most of his life, but I find it, more intimidating & creepily, knowing that his crimes were premeditated & well plan than an idiotic mindless zombie-like primitive flaw coming from his mind. I like to think that he's outsmarting most psychologists, chosen to study him & always one step ahead from the rest. After all, based on Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) he's supposed to be, pure evil, not 'mentally ill'. Its shows determination within the character. I get that, some might disagree with me, but we can agree that the out of the blue twist of convenience involving his doctor, Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer) was stupid. In short, Myers should had been in control of his own destiny, the whole time, and should had brought himself to Laurie's isolated house to try to kill her. Regardless, the recon involving Laurie's children is also somewhat jarring. Look, I can get, why Laurie's son John (Josh Hartnett) from 1998's 'Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later', couldn't existed in this timeline, but the idea that Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris), Laurie's daughter from the fourth movie, 1988's 'Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers' couldn't return is a bit odd. Don't get me wrong, Judy Greer as Karen Strode is alright actress, but there is something emotional driven with Harris's performance as Lloyd. Her acting in 1989's film 'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers', match well with the self-medicating PTSD suffering of her mother. In this movie, Karen felt too normal for somebody who went through an intense paranoid, apocalyptic survival uplifting. Greer just hides the past, too well for me. She should had been a little bit trouble. As for Jamie Lee Curtis. I love this catatonic shell, doomsday prepper side of the character. I just wish, the end, didn't justified, how she treat Karen, when she was a kid. In truth, a dogmatic mindset isn't the way to live life. While, many characters may have some negative qualities, the movie does a good job to show enough positive elements with the main & supporting characters to the point that it was still an empowering tale. Glad, the misogyny and misandry sexual is mostly gone from this film. As the eleventh installment in the film series, this was a breath of fresh air. However, there is rarely any nudity, besides the flashback recap, which I found alright. It's not really needed for the story, they trying to tell. As for the violence, it's a mixed bag for me. The film contains more graphic violence and gore than the original movie, however parts of me, felt that they didn't go far enough. Why introduce a baby element if you're not going to do anything about? At least, the film shows that kids are not immune from getting murder. Still, some of the kills were a bit jarring; like for example, how did Myers get time to hollow out a severed head to make a jack o' lantern? It seems like a lot of scenes were cut. There were a lot of off screen murders. Who knows, maybe it's in, the estimated 30 minutes of footage that was cut from the film. It could still turn up in home releases. Regardless, the movie should had a flashback recreation of the aftermath of the first flick to show, how Myers got even capture in the first place. That was a bit off, seeing that he's nearly unstoppable. Still, the action for the most part was amazing. Yet, it's a bit weird to see that old age hasn't slowed the original characters, even with their battle scars. Released for the 40th anniversary. This movie is rife with sly references to other scenes from the franchise. The Meta touches are nice. Plus, the jokes were funny. However, I do miss first person camera perspectives. In the end, it's the Halloween season & everyone's entitled to one good scare! So, why not, go with the first & second best movies in the franchise. It's one trick or treat, that is too sweet to pass up.",Halloween
42,Platypuschow,Halloween: I don't understand the hype,5,6 January 2019,"After 10 movies and 40 years since the first one, Halloween returns and returned to critical acclaim. But why?My immediate frustration was the timeline shift, and by shift I mean deletion. 10 movies telling the story of Michael Myers and they decide to erase 9 of them and just do a sequel to the first? What kind of logic is that?So with me the film was at an immediate disadvantage. Want to know what made matters worse? I don't like the Halloween films, I think they're incredibly overrated and really just generic slasher films with very little character of personality.I enjoyed Halloween 3 (1982) and that was the one that Myers wasn't even in. Season of the Witch was like a Tales From The Crypt (1989) episode, it was unique, dark and fascinating, everything that the Myers movie aren't.So Laurie Strode returns 40yrs after the incident, a broken woman she has prepared her whole life for another encounter with her own personal boogeyman. With three generations of Strodes in the picture, can they survive another visit from the iconic slasher?With a returning Jamie Lee Curtis and fantastic performers Will Patton and Judy Greer the stars were aligned to hit us with a memorable slasher feature. Alas in this guys view it didn't deliver. It's another generic slasher, but this time round it's nicely polished and very well scored.What is it that people liked so much? What do folks believe is different here than all the other movies (And countless non-Halloween slashers)?. Interesting deaths? No. Next level storytelling? Absolutely not. So what is it?Alas I believe that's a question I'll not have answered, to me this is just another color by numbers teen slasher film.

'Halloween 2018' is no exception. The film was hailed as the franchise's great return, and smashed box office records, so I highly anticipated watching this film. It was SO DISAPPOINTING!The first few minutes of the film were very interesting as they set-up the characters (although there were way too many unnecessary characters) and we see how prepared Laurie Strode is should Michael ever escape and come for her. The film should have been about Laurie Strode. It was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis back again, but she merely made a guest appearance, diminished by the hordes of characters. And how many back stories can you cram into one film?? Seriously?!From the instant the first character is killed, the film becomes a rehash of not only previous Halloween films, but previous slasher films. Ultimately the film offers nothing new, so I genuinely can't understand why this film was such a big success. I got bored. I mean, literally BORED! It was a senseless bodycount deluxe, characters were added simply for the kill, they tried blending humor into the film (which was just stupid!!), the characters did the silliest things - it was cringe worthy!! The film wasn't scary. It wasn't suspenseful. It had cliche upon cliche. It had uninteresting characters. It had the typical Halloween ending that wants us to believe Michael is dead while we know better. Once again there's the cliched ""burn the entire house down"" routine.

Since I had already watched the previous movies I knew what to expect from this movie and I have to admit that it was good to spend your time with but nothing more. The interpretation of Jamie Lee Curtis who played as Laurie Strode was for one more time very good and she made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Judy Greer's who played as Karen and Andi Matichak's who played as Allyson.

48,cruise01,A true horror movie sequel that lives up to the original John Carpenter's film.,8,20 October 2018,"Halloween (4 out of 5 stars).Halloween is back and plays it safe following after the original John Carpenter's film. Basically, starting a brand new fresh take on the franchise while forgetting all those sequels and Rob Zombie's reboot movies. All thanks to David Gordon Green and Danny McBride's fresh take on the sequel while paying a great follow up to the 1978 version. Jamie Lee Curtis is back and better than ever as Laurie Strode. Michael Myers new aged mask is creepy. And there are more body counts as Myer's cross paths with idiot teenagers, police officers, and more stand by victims.The plot follows right after the original movie. Decades later, after Myers is being held at an institution facility, waiting for transfer. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is prepared for Michael's escape. As her house is a fortress with traps, weapons, cameras, and so much more. Laurie is trying to reconnect with her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). As the bus transfer crashes, Michael escapes. And is back on his killing spree. Laurie tries to gather her family to safety and plotting to kill Michael.I am sure it has a plot that has been done before with slasher films. McBride and David Green's script tries to add some freshness to it. The opening moments in the psych ward after two journalists want to speak to Myers. And the opening credits with John Carpenter's theme song brought back. The film sets up the setting with characters like Laurie's daughter and her granddaughter. While they fear that Laurie is still disturbed and needs help. While her paranoia is getting her prepared to face what is about to come. When Michael does escape, he is back on his killing spree. The kills are not as gory or bloody. Just quick deaths with the characters and maybe one or two aftermath disturbing scene with the dead bodies. The suspense build up does bring some chills. Especially on a scene were Michael walks into some random persons house to kill them with a hammer and walk out with a kitchen knife.The film does have that typical horror movie cliché with stupidity. Wish they could have left out and done something smarter with characters choices. Such as a teen girl slipping when being chased. Or characters letting Michael grab them without putting much of a fight back. But the film makes up for it in the last 20 minutes. When Michael and Laurie are facing against each other. As she is putting up a fight and trying to kill.Jamie Lee Curtis is great. Judy Greer and Andi Matichak are great. At least they did not make much bad decisions. Will Patton plays a police officer that is trying to stop Myers.Overall, Halloween is a good slasher film. It brings a fresh take on a dying franchise. Especially, when Rob Zombie ruined it. It feels like a true sequel after the original movie. There may not be gory deaths, or scary. But it does have its suspense. Jamie Lee Curtis shines along with new cast members like Judy Greer and Andi Matichak. I am excited to see were they can take another movie. Hope they can leave out the clichés of stupidity.",Halloween
49,zkonedog,Barely Clears A Very Low Bar,5,20 October 2018,"I have no doubt that Blumhouse productions set out to make the best Halloween franchise sequel with this 2018 installment. From the bold choice to slash (pardon the pun) all other films but the original, to the marketing and general hype around the project, they were ""all in"" on making this a great movie and perhaps even a cultural event. While success may have been achieved on that latter point, the former did not nearly measure up to the classic stature of the original (or even get within the ballpark).For a basic plot summary, ""Halloween (2018)"" sees Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) 40 years after her gruesome attack by Michael Myers. She has become a survivalist, waiting for the (in her mind) inevitable day in which The Shape will return. Her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) want her back as part of the family, but Laurie steadfastly rebuffs out of fear/anger. Of course, the bus transporting Michael to a new Smith's Grove facility crashes on Halloween night, and The Shape is once again released into Haddenfield. Officer Hawkins (Will Patton) and Sam Loomis-disciple Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer) are on his trail, trying to prevent him from claiming his missing victim from 40 years ago.The main problem with this ""Halloween"" incarnation is that it is not, like so many before it, able to replicate the atmosphere of John Carpenter's 1978 original. I don't care how many ""winks and nods"" you give to that film (and there are plenty here)...if you don't get the tone right, you don't have a true Halloween movie. Blumhouse doesn't get the tone right, having the film come off as a gruesome, hard-charging thrill-ride rather than an exercise in creepiness or suspense. While Blumhouse is great at crafting characters relevant to the audiences of today (the company has proven that time and time again), they are not-so-great at surrounding those excellent characters with the best plots or themes.Let's take a quick look at a few things that went really wrong here:-A documentary team is introduced as a very interesting concept...and then killed off before it can really go anywhere.
-Laurie's survivalist arsenal is impressive...until in the end it comes down to her and Michael creeping around a house again, rendering all those guns rather useless (they are better in theory than in practice).
-The scenes ""around town"", once the core of the original, are played with far too much humor this go-round. Laughter roared through the theater every time Michael offed one of the adolescents, while I cringed. I'm not saying all proceedings have to be dead-serious (I remember ""Bob the Ghost""), but here it shifts far too much into straight comedic territory.
-About two-thirds of the way through the film, it actually stumbles into a really great concept proposed by the Loomis-clone: ""why does Michael pursue Laurie as he does?"". In all honesty, they could have built the entire movie around this conceit and had it come off much more intelligent. Instead, it appears at the end and the Doc is snuffed out quickly after vocalizing it.See a pattern emerging here? Clearly, this was a film that wanted to accomplish two things: A. Pay homage to the original; & B. introduce some interesting new concepts into the mix. My retort to each of those goals: A. Better homage is paid when a better film is made; & B. Not a single one of those added concepts actually turn into anything interesting. At the end of the day, this is literally nothing more than Michael chasing Laurie again and murdering some teens and cops along the way.The only reason I can even give this five stars is because, in all honesty, it doesn't go completely off the rails like most of the Halloween sequels (which I have rated as somewhere between 1-4 stars; the lot of them). If you've never seen a Myers Halloween film, it might be passable for you. But if you believed in any ounce of the hype, you'll likely be shaking your head (and not out of awe) as you exit the theater.The saddest statement I have to say about this Halloween is this: If you want to continue past the original, the most productive route is still ""Halloween II"" (a deeply flawed, if entertaining film) and then potentially Rob Zombie's 2007 remake (if you want a different take on things). I'd recommend this path over the Blumhouse '78-to-'18 claim. This one is nothing more than a shallow story throwing things at the wall to see what sticks, all the while weaving in just enough '78 nostalgia shadowing to keep that base placated. Most importantly: it just doesn't capture that creepy tone/vibe from '78. Will anything ever again? I'm starting to wonder.",Halloween
50,eddie_baggins,An unworthily praised sequel,4,1 November 2018,"Defining a genre upon release in 1978 and establishing itself as a classic of the era in many forms, John Carpenter's Halloween needs no introduction, despite the fact its subsequent sequels have continually dwindled its legacy to the point where it felt as though (for good reason) the series was dead and buried.In one of the more surprising movements of recent remakes and re-do's, the Halloween brand found a lifeline in the form of creative duo David Gordon Green and Danny McBride, who despite being more well-known for slacker comedies and character studies, expressed a deep desire to return Halloween to its original roots and craft a genuine sequel to Carpenter's original, 40 year's in the making.Backed by modern day horror kingpin Jason Blum, this intriguing move has turned into one of the year's biggest success stories with Green's film (of which he co-wrote with McBride and Jeff Fradley) igniting and the box-office across the world and receiving its fair share of glowing reviews from critics, who have heralded in this new slasher as both a return to form, a career highlight for Jamie Lee Curtis and an intense look grief and trauma and how that defines our lives.It's a shame then that when watching this film after the fact of these praises and success I found Halloween a shallow and consistently frustrating experience (filled with some of the most glaringly dumb character decisions of the year) that fails to create any real frights around its wince inducing gore and utterly predictable plot line.Re-introducing us to Curtis's Laurie Strode, who now spends her time and money on making a fortress in the wilderness and decorating her spare rooms with mannequins, Halloween see's Michael Myer's return once more to his hunting ground to finish off what he started, as a group of incompetent law enforcement officers and a locked and loaded Strode flail about in a busy manner, without achieving a single thing.You're never watching a film like Halloween to get a ground-breaking story but when the film fails to scare or create characters you care about its mightily hard to find entertainment within a film that clearly rates its own work, that only sporadically comes to the forefront around its poorly scripted dialogue and frequent leaps of faith needed to comprehend the increasingly outlandish occurrences.Carpenter's original Halloween was so efficient and memorable as it took us to a base level of fear and terror as Myer's believably terrorised his victims with nothing more than a common kitchen knife and while there are a few scenes that spook and shock here (particularly a roadside accident and a gas station run in), the whole exercise of Myer's return feels over the top and tacky, if only to say that Strode is haunted by what occurred to her those many moons ago and wants to protect her family from similar threats.Final Say -Due to its ace marketing and advanced hype Halloween was always going to be a success financially but you feel once the hype dies down, this rather forgettable and disappointing outing will be quickly forgotten, even though we should all now prepare for more Michael Myers in our lives in the years to come.2 pre-packed dinners out of 5",Halloween
51,leonblackwood,Disappointing and totally predictable! 3/10,3,21 January 2020,"Review:
This is yet another one of those typical, predictable horror movies, were you can tell who is going to be murdered right from the beginning. After waiting ages for something to happen, I really wasn't surprised by the outcome, but there is a sense of intensity which makes it slightly interesting. Some of the murders are gruesome, but the sketchy storyline was poorly written. With Hollywood running out of ideas for movies lately, it's not surprised that they resurrected Mike Myers, who was pretty scary back in the day, but the bulletproof villain seemed a bit dated now. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Officer Hawkins (Will Patton) are the only characters who seem to be taking the whole reappearance of Mike Myers seriously, so you end up shouting at the screen when the rest of the cast is falling into his hands. Anyway, on the 29th of October, 2018, Michael Myers, who has been institutionalised for 40 years following his killing spree in Haddonfield, Illinois, is being prepared for a transfer to a new facility. True crime podcasters Aaron Korey (Jefferson Hall) and Dana Haines (Rhian Rees) interview Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), Michael's psychiatrist and Dr. Samuel Loomis former student, before meeting with Michael to gain some insight into his mind. During their encounter, Aaron brandishes the mask that Michael wore in 1978 at him, to no effect. The following day, as he is being transferred, Michael crashes the bus, kills a father and son for their car, and returns to Haddonfield. In Haddonfield, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), has lived in fear of Michael for 40 years, drinking heavily and rarely leaving her heavily fortified house, and alienating herself from her daughter Karen (Judy Greer), whom the state took away from her at age 12. The only person in the family she is on good terms with is her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak), Karen's daughter, who urges her to get on with her life. The following day, on Halloween, Michael spots Aaron and Dana visiting his sister Judith's grave in the local cemetery, and follows them to a gas station, where he kills them, as well as a mechanic for his overalls, and recovers his mask. Deputy Frank Hawkins ((Will Patton), who arrested Michael in 1978, tries to convince Sheriff Barker (Omar J. Dorsey) about the danger Michael poses after learning that he has escaped transfer. Laurie learns of Michael's escape after overhearing a news broadcast and attempts to warn Karen and her husband Ray (Toby Huss), but they dismiss her concerns. Later that night, Michael steals a kitchen knife and kills two women. Meanwhile, Allyson finds her boyfriend Cameron Elam (Dylan Arnold) cheating on her at a school-sponsored Halloween party and leaves with his best friend, Oscar (Drew Scheid). Allyson's best friend Vicky babysits Julian when her boyfriend Dave arrived. Michael, who had hidden in the closet, attacks them. Vicky sacrifices herself to save Julian, and Michael kills Dave. Hawkins and Laurie hear the incident over the radio and go over to the house, where Hawkins finds the bodies of Vicky and Dave. Hawkins and Laurie find Michael, and he and Laurie come face-to-face for the first time in 40 years. Laurie shoots Michael in the shoulder before he flees and Sartain persuades Sheriff Barker to allow him to help in the hunt for Michael. Laurie persuades Karen and Ray to seek protection at her house. Michael finds Allyson and Oscar, killing the latter. Hawkins and Sartain arrive just in time to rescue Allyson. Hawkins tries to kill Michael, but Sartain, whose obsessed with Michael's enigmatic motivations, kills Hawkins and reveals that he arranged for Michael's escape in order to study him ""in the wild"". Nevertheless, Michael kills him. Allyson flees, while Michael kills two deputies for their car. Michael arrives at Laurie's house, where he kills Ray. Will Laurie escape alive, while keeping her daughter and granddaughter safe? Will Mike Myers finally get what he deserves...... a slow and painful death! You have to watch it to find out, if you already haven't! With such a low budget, it's not surprising that this movie made a profit at the box office, but that's not to say that it's worth a watch. The director followed the ""Horror"" playbook, scene by scene, so there's isn't any twists and turns to make it unique. On the plus side, it's not that long and it was good to see Jamie Lee Curtis back in the lead, but it's not worth a second watch, once you know the outcome. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by David Gordon Green, who also brought you George Washington in 2000, All The Real Girls, Undertow, Snow Angels, Pineapple Express, Your Highness, The Sitter, Prince Avalanche, Joe, Manglehorn, Our Brand Is Crisis, and Stronger starring Jake Gyllenhaal. He's certainly had a versatile career to date, and he has worked when some established actors, but he played it a bit safe with this film. The whole ""teenagers at school"" theme has been done to death, so that became tedious after a while, and the way that Mike Myers was just roaming the streets murdering people, was completely ridiculous. Anyway, I wasn't a big fan of the resurrection of an old-time classic, and I hope they have decided to put it to bed.Budget: $10million

52,TheMovieDiorama,Halloween treats us to some gory killings but tricks us into believing that this is a fresh sequel.,5,20 October 2018,"There is a difference between paying homage and blatantly creating a pale imitation of an original film in a franchise, especially one spanning four decades. This confused sequel falls into the latter and slashes its way through another missed opportunity. Laurie Strode has waited forty years to acquire revenge, and now serial killer Michael Myers has escaped a rehabilitation facility to wreak havoc in Haddonfield once again. Oh, and it's Halloween again...obviously. The natural evolution of film itself, between 1978 and now, has been vast. Certain aspects of this sequel work, and feels that it has evolved with its audience and Strode herself. Her character is the most developed and represents an intrinsic growth, particularly with the trauma she succumbed to from the events of the original. She's vengeful, empowered and vigilant. The antagonistic Myers remains the same as he lumbers around the streets, stabbing and slicing innocent lives to showcase the improvement of gory makeup. The inherent issue is with how much a replication this sequel is. Far too many scenes were repeated and it became tiresome quickly. From Strode's granddaughter looking out the school window to a one take scene of Michael slaying people to three teenagers walking down a paved path to Strode falling off the balcony and disappearing to a doctor following Myers' case for many years and...well, you get the idea. It was as if the writers were too scared to actually change the structure in the slightest. Balancing the narrative between Strode's personal vendetta and her granddaughter's drunken shenanigans at school was a total miss, unable to blend two differing tones together. If this was a direct remake, it would've worked. The fact that this is a sequel that literally imitates scenes from the original, is lazy and uninspired. This is without mentioning the rushed conclusion and underused podcasters. A conflicting sequel, to which fans will blindly adore, but does introduce the menacing Michael Myers to a new generation.",Halloween

Because I bought into all of the pre-release hype (that's why I ended up buying the book), ""Halloween"" ends up being a pretty big disappointment. It's just another Halloween sequel/remake/reboot/whatever. It's no better or worse than all the Halloween movies that followed the classic original.

56,digitalbeachbum,Cash Grab,1,30 October 2021,"I remember when this was released. Everyone in school was talking about it and how frightened they were to watch it. However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts. If you wanted to see blood and guts, then go join the military and go off to war.",Halloween
57,matthewssilverhammer,Another Less-Than-Stellar Halloween Sequel,6,26 October 2018,"Michael Myers is the glass-ceiling-breaker of the modern slasher genre. Freddy, Jason, Ghostface, Chucky; these iconic figures owe their existence to John Carpenter's 1978 classic. But where many of those monsters have grown into obscurity or dated camp, the unstoppable force of evil that is Halloween's hero/villain is as striking and haunting as it was 40 years ago. With this 2018 sequel, Myers imposing shape and menace is on full display, even if the movie itself pales in comparison to its timeless predecessor.
Writer/director Green opted to ignore all 10 previous series' entries, using only the original as a basis for his story. Myers has been institutionalized for 40 years, Lauri Strode is a doomsday prepper, and the town of Haddonfield looks back on that infamous Halloween night with fable-like disinterest...until, of course, Myers breaks out. There's a lot of OG Halloween mirroring, both ethereally (quiet, open space, slow-movement) and exactly (balconies, closets, resurrecting, the musical score). However, where the film works best is in its creative terror, when the filmmakers aren't so worried about honoring legacy and instead focus on screams.
But that legacy still casts a formidable shadow. When this one tries to recall the original, it works fine, but only in the way that great fan-fiction reminds us of what we already love; and when it breaks away from its inheritance (especially answers provided in the previous sequels), it leaves questions that aren't so much mysterious as they are frustrating. What's Michael's motivation? Why has Laurie not moved on even a tiny bit in 40 years? Still, despite plot-holes, lazy flashbacks, and clunky exposition, Halloween 2018 provides enough October-fun to warrant sitting among the Michael Myers' collection.",Halloween

It's better than most of the sequels but not by much. There is little tension thru-out and Curtis wasnt really needed at all. Her role was annoying and she didnt do an especially good job in the acting department. Michael was decent. The plot had tons of holes in it and then the ending was a HUGE disappointment because it just sets it up for the inevitable. Why cant they just kill him of already beyond a shadow of a doubt?As an aside, I was shocked that some clowns brought their very young kids to see this violent film. No wonder there are shootings everyday.",Halloween
59,southdavid,Murderous Mike XXXXL,6,14 November 2018,"Boldly, though confusingly, ignoring all the existing sequels and reboots in the series (even the ones that Jamie Leigh Curtis was in) Halloween 2018 is a direct sequel to the 70's proto- Slasher movie classic.Mike Myers has been incarcerated in a secure mental hospital since the events of Halloween night 40 years ago. Laurie Stroud is trapped too, mentally if not physically, unable to move on from that night she's endured failed marriages and a breakdown in the relationship with her daughter (Judy Greer). She lives on a secure compound, with a host of firearms and a well-stocked panic room. When the bus transporting Myers to a new institution crashes he is freed and heads back to Haddonfield to relive his murderous past and head for a final showdown with his old foe.It's a strange film in many ways. It's not, in the least bit, scary. . though it's not really trying to be. Myers is a hulking, stalking, killer, often sneaking up on his victims although in full view of the audience. His size and strength mean that nobody is a physical match for him and he can pin people to walls with carving knives. The gore is nicely done, but there's very little in terms of jump scares or true horror imagery. The script does have a few laughs but any fears that David Gordon Green and Danny McBride might have made a parody film can be allayed, though I do think it crossed the line from homage to cliché a few times. I also felt like there were bits of the film missing. I'll do my reviews without spoilers but I strongly felt like the bus crash was going to be revealed as being caused by one of the other characters, but then nothing came of that. . . and another character, Allyson's boyfriend Cameron, played by Dylan Arnold, was given a lot of backstory and screen time only to disappear from the film altogether.There's some decent performances, decent effects and one superlative 5 minutes tracking shot in Halloween, but ""decent"" is about the limit of praise I can provide to a forgettable film that I suspect didn't have the nerve to follow through on some of its bolder ideas.",Halloween
60,videorama-759-859391,Not the best Halloween,5,22 October 2020,"Oh what a come down I was on, I gotta be honest. I was short sheeted on many things here. Even in it's starting, which showed so much promise, out on the checkered grounds, outside the psyche ward, with our aging Michael. being bravely approached by our young hunky English journal, such a suspense building moment is literally robbed from us. It was despicable. Now a recluse, haggard Curtis still bares the brunt of Michael's inflicting rage, where the memory still burns forever deep. Most of this Halloween seems cliched, as in the scenes, that take place on that special cooky night, especially as compared to the last Halloweens, which Rob Zombie did so much better, it's almost dejavu (did like the hot blonde babysitter) as we have hot horny teens making, and kids running amuck. Don't expect all out gore. A few heavy splatters and lashings, here and there. Will Patton, a fine actor, was totally wasted as the sheriff. For me, this film, just seems to hold back on a lot of stuff, and was shortly running out of puff, relying on predictable plotting. A shame as it marks Curtis's return, and it's a well oiled performance it is. The best to come out of this, is a nice cunning twist, you won't see coming, as was my expectations.

The movie picks up exactly 40 years after the 1978 ""Halloween"" movie. As the movie opens, 2 investigative reporters from the UK are at the state ward where Michael Myers has been kept for 40 years, trying to elicit a reaction of some sort from him, to no avail. Michael is about to be transferred to another facility in the next day or so. We then go to ""Haddonfield, Illinois"", as the reporters track down Laurie. who is holed up in her fortified home. In a parallel story, we get to know Laurie's daughter Karen and her family, including high school senior Allyson... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this latest reincarnation of the ""Halloween"" franchise ignores all previous story lines, and picks up 40 years later straight from the original ""Halloween"". Laurie (played once again with bravoure by Jamie Lee Curtis) is now a grandmother, slightly deranged and a bit paranoid, or so it seems, but as it turns out for good reason! The movie's raison d'etre is to see yet another showdown between Laurie and Michael Myers. The movie is, perhaps surprisingly, directed and co-written by David Gordon Green, whose past films such as ""Stronger"" and ""Our Brand Is Crisis"" really didn't indicate he's be the one for a new start in the ""Halloween"" franchise. Surely it helps that Mr. Halloween himself, John Carpenter, returns as a consultant (and executive producer, and soundtrack composer). Once the carnage gets going, the dead bodies pile up (I kept thinking myself, after yet another dead body was stuffed in a body bag: ""they're going to need more body bags!""). There is really nothing scary about the movie, and Michael Myers moves with the subtlety of a bull in a China shop. But it's all in the name of reliving the experience of the 1978 classic, and at that, the movie does okay (the movie is purposefully reminiscent of the late 70s, down to the style of the movie credits). But when all is said and done, the movie doesn't come close to the gold standard that is the 1978 classic.""Halloween"" was released wide this past weekend, and shocked the box office with a gross of $76+ million in its opening weekend. No need to wonder whether there is going to be a sequel: I guarantee that there will be (and producer Jason Blum will readily second that). The Wednesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely for a weekday evening, and the audience seemed to very much enjoy the movie. If you are in the mood for reminiscing about the good ol' ""Halloween"" days of the late 70s, this movie will do fine, or you can just pop in the VHS tape of the 1978 classic.",Halloween

That's a question that the 'Halloween' series is beginning to ask unfortunately. I actually had high hopes that this 2018 version might change up the formula and find a way to renew some energy into the series, but sadly it didn't do that. It is a well made horror movie, that much is hard to dispute. I guess I just wanted a point of difference and that simply wasn't present.There's a fine line between paying homage to past films, and blatantly copying them. There were a lot of ""nods"" in this film, but I couldn't help but feeling like they were more intended to copy great ideas that the original movies had (and hope this generation isn't familiar with them and thus think they're original). It's not a major thing, but I did find it a little tacky.The music is still the best things about these films. As we follow 'Michael' around that haunting tune really does creep down your spine. The acting was also great in this movie. There were some very good scenes of horror and suspense. 'Michael' looks great. There is a lot to like here.

Jamie Lee Curtis gets back into role quite perfectly, showing what a bad memory can do to someone in years to come. I like the way it addresses that Michael Myers isn't has young has he used to be. Also has some good suspenseful scenes always surprising the audience.

It's like it was written in committee where everyone that there little plot be added to the film despite how difficult that would make actual story telling.The results are so many tiny little subplots that you end up not even caring about the main plot as they try to cram them all into the same hole. You end up just not caring at all about any of it.And then the characters shoved into the movie to accommodate the extra plot lines are just as thin and under-developed that it's really hard to care about what happens to them as well.In the end there is so much going on that it never really focuses enough on anything to keep the audience emotionally invested and really you end up only caring about Jamie because she won you over in the first two good films and that kind of holds you just enough to actually finish a film.If she weren't cast in it, even her character would be hard to relate to in any way.It makes you want to take the director by the collar and yell ""focus!"" with the hopes that it would drop all the unnecessary story lines and just deal with what matters.But, you know, there are the political signaling, and for a lot of people that matters more than story telling.For everyone else, there is about 15 minutes, maybe, of actual focused plot and the rest is all tangential.",Halloween
67,jadavix,What a waste of time,3,9 December 2018,"""Halloween"" is a boring, obnoxious mess. It's one of those movies that doesn't really ""start"" until forty five minutes into the run-time, but that proves to be a false start as it immediately gets bogged down in its own rubbish. Too many characters, too much dialogue, nothing to even remotely care about.The movie is something to do with a pair of moronic English journalists who want to do an interview with Michael Myers - who is locked in an asylum - and Laurie Strode, who seems to have become some kind of survivalist, training herself for Michael Myers' imminent return - although, in the world of this movie, he's been locked away since the first ""Halloween"". It's as though all those sequels and remakes and retreads - godawful though they may have been - never happened... so what is she preparing for? It's been 40 years, lady. Move on. The movie wants to have its cake and eat it too: those sequels never happened, but Laurie Strode acts like they did, and you know they did, even if you were lucky enough never to see any of them.(Except for ""Halloween 2"", that's a classic)(No, not the Rob Zombie ""Halloween 2"", the one that followed the original Carpenter version)Anyway, there's also the character of Strode's granddaughter, who is a babysitter and has some boring and charisma-less friends.She's in the habit of ignoring the crazy old lady, which is not surprising, but somehow she knows Michael's coming back and no one will believe her and blah de blah blah.There's also a stand-in for the late Donald Pleasence's psychiatrist character who is introduced far too late for his actions to have any impact on the viewer.What the hell happened to David Gordon Green? ""Undertow"" and ""Joe"" were both great. ""Pineapple Express"" was pretty good. ""Your Highness"" was forgivable considering it came after ""Pineapple Express"", which was probably Green's most successful movie. But now this... any director could have made this. How disappointing.",Halloween
68,Stevieboy666,"Mixed opinions, spoilers necessary",7,29 October 2018,"I've been following the build up to this one, though as always careful not to get carried away with the hype, and finally saw it last night at the cinema. Well I have to say that I have mixed feelings.
On the positive side it was great to see the opening credits with Carpenter's theme tune and the name Jamie Lee Curtis appear on the screen. I really liked the first half of the film and to be fair this is a decent, effective and brutal slasher/horror movie. It certainly does not disappoint on that count. This film takes place 40 year after the events of the original, totally ignoring parts 4-8 (obviously 3 is not a Myers film) which is, on one hand, an interesting idea. On the other hand I always felt that H2O (part 7) should have wrapped the series up (what the hell were they thinking with part8!!??). Halloween (2018) eventually builds to the inevitable finale of Michael Myers vs sister Laurie Strode, and ** spoilers time ** no prizes for guessing who wins! Michael ends up getting trapped, set on fire and presumably killed. However, he's survived fire before and it really would not surprise me if he survived again. Instead of bringing the franchise to a good close we will see another Halloween film in the future. Personally I hope not. It did not end convincingly in my opinion and I do not like the thought of this film being a franchise reboot rather than a decent conclusion.",Halloween
69,stevendbeard,Lots of 'Nods' To The Original Films,7,20 October 2018,"I saw ""Halloween"", starring Jamie Lee Curtis-Scream Queens_tv, True Lies; Judy Greer-The Ant_Man movies, 13 Going On 30; Will Patton-Falling Skies_tv, The Punisher_2004 and Haluk Bilginer-Ben_Hur_2016, The International.
A lot of people have asked me if this is a sequel or a reboot or what. It is a sequel to the first 2 Halloween movies-it ignores all the other sequels in the series-and it takes place 40 years after them. Michael Myers is in an institution-and has been for 40 years-and has not spoken a word in all that time. Jamie/Laurie has been-and still is-a complete wreck; her daughter, Judy, at the age of 12, was taken away from her and Jamie has become a recluse, living in the woods, away from everyone. Jamie has also fortified her house and stocked up on firearms, just in case Michael escapes and comes after her. Some people might say she has become a little paranoid. Haluk plays the doctor treating Michael-Donald Pleasence's replacement-and Will is the local police that has to deal with Michael when he does eventually escapes. There are lots of 'nods' to the first 2 Halloween movies, with some scenes identical and others with variations. Michael and Jamie/Laurie are not brother & sister in this movie, as opposed to some of the other movies in the series. John Carpenter is given producer credit, as well as credit for the music and FYI: John Carpenter has stated that this is supposed to be the final Halloween movie. But, you know how it is, if a movie makes money......
It's rated ""R"" for horror violence, bloody images, language, drug use and some brief nudity and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.

73,parry_na,Slain it all before.,2,30 March 2019,"We have two 'iconic' characters from the franchise now: Michael of course, and Laurie Strode, played by the mighty Jamie Lee Curtis: more mature now, but still very much in possession of 'the body' she was famed for back in the 1980s. Strode is now a self-confessed basket-case, which allows her grand-daughter plenty of opportunities to appeal to the teen-audience by dishing out life-advice for granny. ""Get over it,"" for example, in relation to her ongoing trauma caused by events in the original film. Another familiar face - and I realise this may be a minority thrill among this film's fans - is that of Dr Sartain, who has been looking after Michael since Dr Loomis is now dead, like the actor who played him (we get a brief and very welcome voice-over from Donald Pleasance early on). Sartain is played by Haluk Bilginer, who was terrific - also in the 1980s - as roguish Mehmet in BBC soap EastEnders when it was at the height of its powers.The associated teens here are as silly as you would expect. Quick witted, sexually arrogant and fashionably stoned. They don't annoy too much, but the weightier material is reserved for two pod-casters who are eager to get inside the mind of Michael, Aaron Korey(Jefferson Hall) and Dana Haines (Rhian Rees). They don't have much time to achieve this.I've never been massively into this franchise. I found the first film enjoyable and Rob Zombie's 2007 reboot breathed new life into a fairly standard central character. All other sequels, or reimaginings, I have found incredibly tedious. This version, after giving Michael such a build-up, chooses to begin his latest mild killing spree in curiously muted fashion. There is no sense of occasion. That Michael always happens to go on a rampage on Halloween, and that he is referred to as 'boogie man' has seemed to me a blatant merchandise ploy. That said, when John Carpenter's theme music kicks in, there's no denying its power.I found this rather lacklustre to be honest. Once again for example, a major moment of drama occurs because one teen kisses another teen. It is difficult to care because firstly, the characters are inoffensive but vacuous, and secondly, Michael's strolling round leisurely hacking people up (often off camera, surprisingly and disappointingly). A sadly diluted environment for this much lauded return.",Halloween
74,henry8-3,Halloween,7,20 October 2018,Michael Myers escapes after 40 years incarceration and does what he does best - and very gory it is to. Laurie (Lee Curtis) has never got over the events from 1978 and has bunkered herself away with lots of guns etc etc. When he gets out though........A fitting tribute to Carpenter's classic original with a number of really well put together original set pieces as well as some smart direct tributes - particularly MM looking out of the window at one point - great stuff. One or two nice jumps and scares along the way plus some wonderfully disgusting deaths alongside a nice liberal sprinkling of gallows humour and of course THAT music!To note - this ignores the various remakes etc since Halloween II.Great fun,Halloween

77,drownnnsoda,Commendable sequel in a series that has been run dry,7,19 October 2018,"While it may not quite have reached the level of insanity that the ""Friday the 13th"" series has, the ""Halloween"" franchise is certainly one that has splintered in so many directions over the years that each film is left nearly a part of its own universe. This David Gordon Green-directed retread goes back to the drawing board and writes out the events of every ""Halloween"" sequel thus far (including ""Part II""), and has Laurie Strode suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder 40 years after the events of the original film. Her daughter and granddaughter both struggle with their mother and grandmother's mental illness, but it turns out Laurie's paranoia may not be entirely in vain-on Halloween 2018, Michael escapes and comes hunting through Haddonfield again.While I was initially skeptical of Green and co.'s decision to ignore the plotlines of the former ""Halloween"" sequels, it began to make more and more sense when I thought of the number of hands that have been on this series, which is a tangled mess already. This sequel cuts the gristle and takes it back to the basics, more or less, which was a smart, albeit risky, decision. It pays off to some degree, as there are a handful of fantastic set-pieces, in-jokes and nods to the previous films it itself ignores, and several suspense sequences that are masterfully-handled.The pitfall? The film simply has its hands in too many baskets. Where the previous sequels individually had a grounded sensibility to them, this one feels scattered-there are too many peripheral characters that pop up, are briefly introduced under the guise of being central to the story, and appropriately dispatched in the same breath. Of course many slasher films do this, but in this case there is a disconnect both geographically and relationally. The film is at its best when it remains within the world of Laurie Strode, who a welcome Jamie Lee Curtis portrays extremely thoughtfully. That being said, the scattered nature of the film leaves even the family dynamics between her daughter and granddaughter (played by Judy Greer and newcomer Andi Matichak, respectively) feeling underserved.Despite this notable issue, I find it impossible to knock the film, as it is a truly apty-made slasher film, and hands-down the best installment in this series since ""H20"" in 1998. It does not reinvent the wheel by any means, but it spins it well and has fun with a premise that has frankly been run dry over the last 40 years.All in all, ""Halloween"" 2018 is a must-see for fans of this series-even the most begrudging. As a straightforward slasher flick, it's very nicely done, and as a part of the ""Halloween"" series, it is surely one of the better sequels in spite of its sometimes-scatterbrained handling of plotlines. 7/10.",Halloween
78,lukem-52760,"EXCELLENT RAW,GRITTY SURVIVAL HORROR!!! but not as good as H20.",8,12 May 2019,"The new Halloween sequel that ignores everything after the original '78 CLASSIC is a very well made survival Horror Thriller with an excellent performance from the legendary Jamie lee curtis,actually this could be the performance of her career she's that good here.
This sequel is very gritty & very brutal with a rawness to the atmosphere like a primal feel to this film that works perfectly with our tough disturbed hero Laurie Strode (curtis) & we have new raw sounding music by the legendary John Carpenter to add to this excellent Horror movie.The basic story is Michael Myers escapes & comes home to hunt Laurie Strode & her troubled family who consist of her daughter & grand daughter & all performances are very good to excellent & that goes to CurtisMichael Myers is terrifying & extremely violent abit like Rob Zombies underrated version that i really liked!!!
There's a great showdown with Laurie & Myers & it's exciting & scary & very clever but i have to admit i still prefer the showdown of the 90's Classic Halloween H20 & i still prefer that movie over this one but that sits on a different time line now in the Franchise so I'm just talking about this new flick.
This movie brought Myers back to be terrifying again & Jamie lee curtis acts the traumatised but ready Laurie Strode perfectly going from a crying emotional mess to a tough as hell equipped hunter she's magnificent.
My only complaint is i hated the ""Dad"" character who is always trying to be funny & when his daughter is missing on Halloween night & knowing Michael Myers is out hunting & killing he doesn't act bothered at all!!!! He still acts silly & couldn't care less about his teenage daughter out there? I hated his character & couldn't wait for him to die.An excellent performance from Jamie lee curtis & an exciting new Halloween atmosphere makes the new Halloween a very very good movie.",Halloween

As for good, the theme, atmosphere is great, Michael is awesome as in his best, camera work and sounds were on spot. Were great style. For example there was a scene there Michael just enters random house kills a woman gets a knife and leaves like nothing happened, it was brilliant, exacly how Halloween movie should be. As for bad, plot is stupid, you tell me a doctor would risk his career and let dozens of people die just so he could see how does a serial killer acts on loose. Also majority of characters are so stupid, they only exist to be killed. The ending is so stupid, the thing Michael survived the fire is so cheap and yep, it was a sequel bait.",Halloween
80,Pairic,Good Sequel,8,25 October 2018,"Halloween: A life lived less ordinary, this has certainly been the case for Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). For forty years she has trained to fight Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney and Nick Castle) lest he escapes and not just him, she sees the world as a dark threatening place, turning her home into a fortress. This has cost her custody of her daughter Karen at age twelve, taken into care due to her mother's paranoia. Similar to the situation faced by John Connors when raised by his mother Sarah in Terminator 2. Karen (Judy Greer) now has her own teenage daughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak). A reconciliation dinner between the generations fails when Lauri's fears of Myers come to the fore again.Two brash, interfering journalists come to interview Myers (who hasn't spoken for forty years) at Gore Sanatorium, but even revealing his original mask doesn't make him break his silence. That night, Myers and other criminally insane patients are being moved to another psychiatric hospital but the bus crashes. Myers is loose once again and now he has three generations of the Strodes to hunt down. mayhem ensues as he wanders through Haddorfield. Wearing his mask, he is provided with camouflage by trick or treaters and those going to fancy dress parties.Some shocking scenes as people are stabbed through their throats, hung on walls with knives, beheaded and impaled in railings. The search for Myers is on and the Sstrodes family retreat to Lauri's fortress home but can anything stop this monster? Some great scenes throughout the film but there are two stand out shots. First when the journalists go to meet Myers, the (most dangerous) patients are in a yard that is set out like a chess board, they resemble pieces, chained to weights while they enjoy the sun. Secondly the scene of the crashed bus, patients wander around the road and come looming like Zombies in the mist.A good rather than a great direct sequel to the original is delivered by director David Gordon Green but it deserves 8/10.",Halloween

Strangely, I still don't really get anything out of the kills and I don't understand why some people do. But I enjoy movies that are meant to be scary, and this one was fairly well made.

They then try to fool Laurie to meet with Michael. She's in survival mode holed up in her ranch practicing shooting.Her daughter, Karen, is trying to live a normal live with her husband raising their teenage daughter Allyson away from the whole Michael Myers trauma.On Halloween they decide to transfer Michael to another mental institution. Surprise, surprise, the bus crashes and many of the patients are on he loose. The good Dr. is also alive. A father and son stop to check out the situation. That means that Michael will get his hands on a car. Somehow he manages to run into the two English at a gas station. Fortunately he dispatches them right away.Next we waste some time with Allyson and her friends. It's Halloween so they're going to a party. Meanwhile Michael makes it to Karen's town and neighborhood and goes after a babysitter. The cops have hooked up with the doctor and are looking for him, so is Laurie. As Allyson makes her way home alone, she has a run-in with Michael. So now Laurie knows what to do. She gets Karen and Allyson and drives to her ranch where they wait for Michael for the inevitable violent confrontation between the two tough senior citizens.I'm a fan of 70s-80s horror but the Halloween movies never did much for me. This sequel doesn't do much to change that. It retains some of that 70s 80s flair and style and unfortunately also the slower pace. But it's too 2000s politically correct. The violence and gore are there but are too occasional. We needed a couple additional babysitters. There's no nudity for some reason. Somehow nudity is all the rage on TV but it's not OK in R-rated movies these days. This movie is about 15 minutes too long and comes across as a looong TV episode instead of a movie.

84,masonfisk,HOPEFULLY DONE & DONE...!,5,30 October 2018,"40 years on & we have, what the filmmakers have avowed, the first direct sequel to the original classic made by John Carpenter. David Gordon Green, who started out as an indie filmmaker w/films like George Washington, Undertow & Prince Avalanche has since dipped his creative toe into mainstream waters w/fare like Pineapple Express, The Sitter & Your Highness which vary from middling to down right forgettable so it comes as a bit of a shocker to see him being such a proponent to making this new Halloween (co-scripted by Danny McBride) that as a lover of the original, I was colored intrigued. For the most part when the film works, which it does in fits & starts, it plays like an appropriate & reasonable successor but where it fails & it does, I almost needed some Bengay for my neck from how hard I was shaking my head. The plot has Michael Meyers breaking out of his mental hospital bus while in transpo & returning to the scene of his crimes to wreck havoc anew while Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode, the shell shocked survivor, must come to grips w/her sanity (or what's left of it) to rise to the occasion when Michael comes a-calling. Seeing from a mile away how the filmmakers pretty much wrote themselves into many a corner their only solution was to drop a needless surprise twist & pepper the mostly sober proceedings w/dollops of unnecessary humor & character diversions. It feels like the nails have been struck hard into this franchise's cinematic coffin w/some finality but a buck's a buck so don't be surprised to see whatever good will this outing has afforded to be cheapened w/a useless follow up.",Halloween
85,peterp-450-298716,"It's old skool, predictable but worth a watch.",7,9 March 2019,"He's no longer dormant.
He only knows how to keep moving and to keep killing.
And he will kill again unless he's captured.Exactly 40 years ago the film ""Halloween"", directed by John Carpenter, was released. A milestone in the slasher genre. It was in this film that Laurie Strode (a very young Jamie Lee Curtis) escaped from the psychopath Michael Myers in the nick of time. And so the legend about Myers arose. And now, 40 years later, the follow-up appears. To my surprise, this is already the 11th movie in the ""Halloween"" universe. No idea what happened in the other episodes, because I never bothered to watch them. And even though I feared this would simply be a continuation of the same concept (and it sure is) and that I would have a ""haven't-I-seen-this-before"" feeling, I have to admit it. I kind of liked this movie.Maybe this has to do with the nostalgic value of this film. Everything feels like the original film. The same creepy soundtrack is used. Even the font used in the credits has a nice old-fashioned look. Jamie Lee Curtis is also back again. Again it takes place in the Halloween period. And the masked Michael Myers bumps into fresh meat once more. And he's eager to plant his butcher's knife in their body. It feels like old-fashioned, old skool horror, as they appeared in the 70s.I only wondered about one thing. Was it really necessary to make a sequel to the famous first film? After all, you'll know in advance that they are going to continue on the same thing and you can already predict which direction it will take. What gives new impetus is the older Laurie who has withdrawn into a house in the forest, protected by ingeniously invented systems and strategically placed spotlights. A kind of fort equipped with all sorts of gadgets to keep unwanted intruders out. There's even a panic-room with a food supply enough to survive a 3rd world war plus an arsenal of weapons with which you can eradicate a whole flock of zombies. The reason why Laurie has installed herself in this way is of course Myers. Her paranoia about this figure hasn't disappeared over the years and she expects that he'll show up again someday.Films of this genre are usually richly filled with illogical reasoning and stupid behavior. For example, the extremely dangerous Michael Myers has been locked up in a highly secure establishment for 40 years. And during all those years, this psychopath hasn't uttered a single word. The fact that a bunch of amateur journalists can talk to him for a moment, wouldn't be admitted without additional measures in reality. They would be thoroughly searched so they couldn't smuggle prohibited articles inside (like a mask for instance). But especially the fact that this notorious murderer is treated as an average patient during a transfer, could be called hilarious. An ordinary orange school bus with a few other detainees is used for this purpose. If it were me, he'd be captured in a block of concrete and he'd be guarded by a whole battalion of guards. I wouldn't take the risk. As always, you as a viewer know what is about to happen. Not them apparently.Well, fortunately, because otherwise, the movie ""Halloween"" wouldn't be what we expected. A nerve-racking slasher in which Myers scares everyone by standing motionless and emotionless somewhere in a dark corner while observing. And everyone who crosses his path gets acquainted with the razor-sharp knife he carries with him. And as always, housewives, babysitters, and teenagers will be the victims. Unfortunately, all this didn't have the desired effect on me. It wasn't scary. Only the inevitable final fight provides the necessary tension for a moment.Needless to say that only Jamie Lee Curtis excels here as the stressed out grandmother who has been preparing for this confrontation for 40 years. The rest of the cast is secondary and the only reason why they are present is to raise the total number of casualties. Some characters are even annoying. And actually, it makes you happy that they are being murdered (like the bickering policemen who discussing their sandwiches). Apparently, Jason Blum wants to make 10 sequels of ""Halloween"". I guessù Jamie Lee Curtis won't be in it. Because even though she still has the perfect feminine curves, she starts to look like a painting by Rembrandt. She's slightly cracked and a cultural heritage.",Halloween
86,I_Ailurophile,40 years overdue and 100% worth it,9,1 November 2021,"Following John Carpenter's magnificent 1978 film 'Halloween,' a franchise was born that immediately plumbed the depths of nonsensical slasher pablum. I have, to say the least, been skeptical about indulging in any entries after experiencing the first unfortunate sequel of 1981. But to read of the production history of the 2018 film - effectively retconning the series beyond its progenitor, and marked by the approval of Carpenter himself - I couldn't decline. I haven't been led astray: 2018's 'Halloween' is phenomenal.With minimal exposition, the first scene immediately builds tension, leading into opening credits that cheekily mirror the 1978 sequence. I love that the score reflects revitalized compositions from Carpenter himself, working alongside frequent current collaborators Daniel Davies, and Carpenter's son Cody - while also demonstrating a modern sensibility, not at all unlike Carpenter's music of recent years following his departure from cinema. I deeply appreciate the next several scenes, very quickly but with an expert hand showing us Laurie's obsession, and her fractured family, and setting up the plot for the remainder of the feature. It's also hard to miss the fantastic potshot in an early piece of dialogue, pointedly rebuking the notion that Laurie and Michael are siblings.The bodies rapidly begin to accumulate after a fashion consistent with what the slasher genre became in the past 40 years. Why, if anything, there's an even more blunt forthrightness to the affair for no small part of the length, as to an extent the camera follows Michael through Haddonfield. Yet that candor is clearly bitingly intentional - and in no way dampens the outstanding, unsettling atmosphere that the film readily builds. Even while centered on Laurie and her estranged family, 2018's 'Halloween' is loosely divided into interconnected, slowly converging concurrent soft foci of Michael's murder spree, and the ongoing hunt for him. More than ever before, the shape is portrayed as a genuine, dark force of nature, an instinctual and unyielding predator, and with that slant follows pervasive, chilling dread portending his coming.Primo lighting, excellent blood and gore, Carpenter's stupendous score, exceptional camerawork, top notch scene writing and construction, marvelous set design, strong characterizations and performances to match, and every other possible consideration is rendered with utmost attentive, loving care and passion. Every aspect heightens the thrills, sharpens the suspense, compounds the tension, and amplifies the atmosphere. Though arguably perhaps coming off as a little too orderly and polished, the narrative is solid - very well written, and complete. The pace of the entire feature, editing and sequencing, plot development, and the overall flow are natural, fluid, unobstructed, once again an exercise of only the greatest painstaking meticulousness. It's obvious that everyone involved knew the ground they were treading on, and knew they had to make the new 'Halloween' the undisputed, definitive, superlative sequel it could be. They handily succeeded.My congratulations to cast and crew alike. I was ambivalent when I first heard about the film, but everything I'd read of it since had changed my assumptions, and I am ecstatic that this turned out to be everything I was promised - and more! So much more! 2018's 'Halloween' embraces both the slasher genre that its predecessor helped to foment, and the hair-raising, perpetually uneasy meditation on violence and apprehension that Carpenter did so well as a filmmaker (and that one may hope he still decides to return to). Sequels, remakes, and franchises are often dubious, and deservedly regarded with distrust, but this is a welcome, refreshing exception; not many cinematic successors come to mind that are as auspicious in their creation and achievements. With confidence and enthusiasm, and as a definite John Carpenter fangirl, I happily say that 2018's 'Halloween' is a movie that should stand to be beloved not just of the horror genre broadly, but of devotees of the 1978 origin. This is remarkable, and I'm quite ready to already watch it again.",Halloween
87,masonsaul,Disappointing but still good,6,4 March 2019,"Halloween (2018) is a better sequel than the original Halloween 2, unfortunately it's still a big disappointment that focuses on all the wrong parts and frustratingly sidelines the best part of the film.Jaimie Lee Curtis gives a great performance but is sidelined for a lot of the movie (again). It's well directed by David Gordon Green but fails to be scary and the twist is bad. The film focuses too much on new and uninteresting characters.However, the music by John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies is incredible. It's reasonably well paced. The final confrontation is really good and cleverly recreates shots from the original film but is still brought down slightly by a sequel bait ending.",Halloween
88,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Solid Sequel to a Classic,7,3 February 2019,"This film is quite interesting to me. I loved the original when my mother showed it to me growing up. The sequels I would also watch every year during October for AMC FearFest and other channels would show it as well. Despite this, it was never my favorite franchise. I did fall into the hype of this one and wanted to see it. To get this going, the official synopsis is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney & Nick Castle), the mask figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago.We kick off at Smith's Grove, where Michael has been kept since that fateful night he went on a rampage. A couple has come to try to interview him. They are Dana Haines (Rhian Rees) and Aaron Korey (Jefferson Hall). They are trying to do a podcast on what happened and they don't want him taken to a cell where nothing can be learned from him. The doctor who has taken over for Dr. Loomis is Sartain (Haluk Bilginer). He doesn't want that either. Aaron tries to evoke a response by holding out the mask to him, but he doesn't get anything more than a sideways glance.The two then go try to meet with Laurie. She only lets them in since they are going to pay her $3000. They don't buy that Michael is pure evil and they say some things that cut pretty deep with Laurie. Since that night, Laurie has not been able to let go. It has ruined two marriages and her daughter taken away from her. We also learn that it has caused her daughter to keep her grandchild at a distance. Laurie makes for a great mirror of Michael in that she also has dedicated her whole life to him getting out and her being the one that kills him. I dug that duality.We then get to meet her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer). She has a daughter of her own, Allyson (Andi Matichak). Ray (Toby Huss) is the husband and father. He is somewhat funny in a fatherly, awkward way and more laid back. I like this because both Karen and him are the opposite of Laurie in different ways.Allyson is seeing a boy who is a little rough around the edges, Cameron (Dylan Arnold). We get this through conversation with her parents as Ray used to do drugs with Cameron's father. Allyson sees the good in him though. The film does well at filling in the back-story that this is a direct sequel to the original by debunking the myth of Michael and Laurie being siblings.The night they are trying to transport Michael to a new facility, the bus crashes and he gets free. He runs into the couple that came to interview him. They fall victim as he gets his mask back and heads for Haddonfield. Laurie learns about it on the news and goes about her preparations she's been waiting 40 years for, the showdown with Michael. The police are also involved with Hawkins (Will Patton) among them.Now as someone who is not a fanboy of the original or really the series, I liked this film. Does it feel like the original? No, because that original was more about the stalking where this one is what a sequel should do, it ramps up the body count. This one is gorier than the original as well. That's not to say we aren't getting mirrors of the first. We have him escaping from his institute, getting his mask and jumpsuit. It is even taking beats from other movies in this series that it is ignoring as well. It took this third viewing to connect those.The pacing for this film I thought was good for a slasher. It has a running time around 1 hour and 45 minutes, which this last time felt a bit long. We get introduced to the characters and it doesn't waste time getting into it. I never experienced a lull and tension builds as characters start to get killed off. You can feel it culminating into the final showdown, which I thought was good. If I do have an issue, it is with the Dr. Sartain. There is an aspect with his character that I understand, but it feels like they're doing an inverse of Loomis.Getting back to the positive, there is some good. Curtis embodies the role of Laurie. I like that she is broken by what happened to her and she has let it define her life. I do think there was an outburst in the film that I wasn't a fan of, but I could see someone who has dealt with what she has turning to drugs or alcohol to cope. Greer is interesting as she had a rough childhood. She has decided as an adult that she is going to live her life the way she wants and it is opposite of her upbringing. Matichak was also fine. She is coming into her own. Her mother is somewhat estranged from her grandmother, but she is looking for that connection. Courtney and Castle are great in bringing Michael to life. I did have an issue with Bilginer's character though. There is a twist in the film involving him that I just thought was out of place. I like that he is obsessed like Dr. Loomis, but some of the things he does didn't sit well. It moves the story along, but it feels forced. Patton is always solid and this film is no different. Rhees and Hall aren't really much to the story aside. The rest of the cast though was good and round out the film for what was needed.Effects for this film were solid as well. They were done practically for the most part. There is one that I could clearly see it was CGI, mostly because it looked like it would have been nearly impossible to do practically. How it is shot helps to hide it. The blood in the film looks good and the practical effects were as well. I also wanted to say that the framing of some of the shots were absolutely amazing. There was a couple that I just was in awe and really liked them. They used the depth of the shot as an advantage.I couldn't get through this without talking about the score of the film. I was stoked when I heard that John Carpenter was coming back to do the music. That is what really helps make the original film and I think he did an amazing job here. His son also helped him with doing it and I think they did enough of taking the original and updating it. It helps to build tension and fits the scenes perfectly.Now with that said, I enjoyed this film. I don't think it is the best I've seen from that year or the best in the series, but it is still one of the better ones from it. The story is interesting enough and helps to clear up issues that were created by all of the sequels. I still like them, don't get me wrong. I thought the acting was good, aside from a couple of hiccups. There were some issues with some of the dialogue, but it doesn't ruin the film for me. The effects are the same way. The score of the film was amazing. This one isn't like the original in that it's not stalking the people, but it is more for the body count, which a sequel normally does. I would recommend giving this film a viewing as I thought it was solid.",Halloween
89,pachara87,Easily the best of the Halloween sequels...,8,17 February 2020,"This Halloween posits that we stop questioning so goddamn much, accept the wolves at the door, and fortify our homes with the means to destroy the evil we know wants to end us.",Halloween
90,davidmvining,A solid thriller with odd moments of comedy sprinkled throughout,7,22 November 2019,"David Gordon Greene is an interesting director. He started out with micro-budgeted independent films like Undertow and George Washington before falling in with Danny McBride (and James Franco) for Pineapple Express. He made small to medium budgeted studio stoner comedies for a few years while occasionally making tiny movies here and there like Joe. He had a hand in Eastbound and Down and directed the second season of Vice-Principals where he apparently fell in love with Charleston, South Carolina as a filming location, for when he was given the reins to the Halloween franchise, he decided to recreate California acting like Illinois with Charleston. His history does not lend itself to the idea that horror would be his bag.The first half hour of his Halloween is pretty much a straight drama with some brooding elements here and there. Laurie Strode's experience fighting Michael Myers in 1978 scarred her deeply to the point that she is a broken woman living on the outskirts of Haddonfield, Illinois on her bunker full of hiding spots, traps, and guns. Her daughter wants nothing to do with her, but Laurie's granddaughter feels that Laurie isn't getting the right level of appreciation from the family. There's a great scene where Laurie shows up to a family outing at a restaurant and just breaks down in front of everyone, including her granddaughter's boyfriend. It's uncomfortable and odd, but that's exactly what it's supposed to be. Not only has Laurie's experience broken her, but she's allowed it to completely dominate every aspect of her life. It's a sad sight.Of course, the movie isn't a straight drama. It's a horror movie, and the horror comes from Michael Myers escaping from his prison and running loose again (any rumors of any other adventures between 2018 and 1978 are false). The introduction to Myers through a pair of investigative journalists, invited by Myers' doctor to try and elicit a reaction from the silent giant, is a wonderfully brooding piece of filmmaking. These three characters are consumed with the idea that there's something more to Michael Myers than simple evil, but Laurie warns them that they are wrong. It's a tad unclear (probably on purpose), but I think Myers' doctor organizes the killer's escape from the prison bus. He's expressed frustration in the idea that Myers has said nothing in forty years, and Myers is his life's work. He, essentially, knows as much about Myers after decades of study than when he began. He releases Michael so he can observe and study further, to understand Myers' beyond the silent killer.But, of course, Laurie is right. Michael is just pure evil. And as the movie transitions from brooding drama about trauma into a horror movie, the film falters a bit. The middle section of the film is dancing around a few different tones that all clash together pretty harshly, undermining any real sense of impending danger. There is the central moment where Michael has a small rampage in Haddonfield's residential district, grabbing random weapons in one house and killing someone before simply moving on, that's right there, and it's great. However, it's surrounded by scenes that contain humor that, while oftentimes actually kind of funny, aren't placed in the greatest part of the movie and undermines the tension building. The last time this is a real problem is when we see two cops talking about Ban-Mi sandwiches. It simply doesn't work and stops a tension crescendo in its tracks.After that moment, though, the movie goes full horror, and it's quite good. Perhaps some of the mechanics are a bit wonky to make it happen, but once there, the fight in and around Laurie's house is really effective tension and horror.I read that Greene and McBride (one of the writers) were offered to film two Halloween movies back to back, but they turned it down because they wanted to figure out what they did right and wrong with the first movie before jumping into a second. Here's to hoping that if they do film a second film, that they work on getting a more effective and consistent tone.",Halloween
91,TheOneThatYouWanted,Drops off,6,6 January 2019,"This film was great up until the third act. Not sure why I was struggling to stay awake during the climax but I blame the action choices.

92,jadepietro,More Treat than Trick,7,22 October 2018,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Mikey and Jamie are back in a formulaic horror film that generally works.JIM'S REVIEW: Let me begin by saying that I am lowering the bar with this review of Halloween (2018). This sequel is a standard horror flick with a lot of violent murders and a modicum of wit. Is it as good as its iconic original source? Definitely not. That was a low budget thriller that used its creative resources, namely John Carpenter's direction, and made killing fun with a minimum of gore and a maximum of real suspense. Is this film as bad as the many sequels and ripoffs that the series has previously spawned? Absolutely not, this version is vastly superior of all of them. It values the original source and adds to that story. Does the movie have more to say than most slasher films? Well, sorta...It still follows the formulaic kills (Sex-obsessed teenagers meet their demise as will any person of any age, particularly dumb trespassers who gets into Michael's path of destruction.) However, this version also deals with the theme of victims and their traumatic baggage that changes their life. And Jamie Lee Curtis gives the film a fully dimensional heroine to root for.Again, it is the special time of year when autumn calls and creatures roam the night. The evil Michael Meyers, still incarcerated these many 40 years for his mass killing spree, is about to be transferred...during the Halloween holidays! Bad timing for all. Now we already know what will happen...can't avoid any spoiler, can we? Look out, Laurie Strode...he's a-comin' in yer direction!The film takes awhile with its set-up before getting down to the bloody business. Slicing and dicing his way toward his favorite victim, our killing machine eagerly finds unsuspecting victims along the way to grandma's house, although some of Michael's prey is too quickly dispatched without any real suspense. He's also fairly spry for a guy in his 60's, quite clever at finding his special traumatized babysitter's fortress. But our Laurie has become a gun-toting paranoid survivor and ready to protect all those near and dear to her. The perfect AARP poster couple, perhaps? So let the battle begin.The main question is: Does this formula still work? In the hands of its director, David Gordon Green, and his co-writer, Danny McBride, that answer is yes. Having Ms. Curtis back in her classic role certainly helps too. There are enough scares and tense moments throughout with some humorous in-jokes bantered about. The remixing of the famous soundtrack is a nice touch. The various deaths are treated with a degree of respect and cleverness, ranging from stabbing, impalements, throst-slitting, and head-crushings, although this reviewer would have preferred that the filmmakers showed less bloody violence and more restraint. The communal aspects of seeing this movie with a live audience adds to the enjoyment as well.So, as genres go, Halloween (2018) is a well-earned chapter in the tale of Laurie Strode and her Bogeyman. Somehow, I am sure that there will be more contact in their future.",Halloween
93,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Halloween,7,20 October 2018,"After forty years in a mental institution, evil-eyed Michael Myers escapes to reek havoc on the fragile inhabitants of Haddonfield, Illinois. With plenty of armed weaponry and PTSD in tote, badass survivalist Laurie Strode (a weathered Jamie Lee Curtis) vows to kill Myers while keeping him from showing off his neato butcher knife. That's the crux of 2018's Halloween, my latest review. Trick-or-treat all you fanboys, Samhain enthusiasts, and tattooed worshipers of masked Micheal!Anyhow, Halloween is the 11th film in a series that dates back all the way to John Carpenter's pioneering installment via 1978. It announces itself as the only sequel and denounces every other story angle from all the money-grabbing sequels that came before it. Gone is the campy feel from Halloween's 4, 5, and 6. Gone is the scuzzy and vile stature from Rob Zombie's carnival vision. Gone is every element from Season of the Witch (naturally). Added is the gore and squeamish factor from 1981's Halloween II (plus a little humor courtesy of actor turned scribe, Danny McBribe).In truth, this new Halloween is lean, mean, and impracticable, with streamlined direction from ill-defined genre director David Gordon Green. Granted, Green is not as stylish, innovative, or tension-ridden as Carpenter nor does he have Johnny boy's fiendish way with the characters (almost everyone involved is either underdeveloped or obvious denizens just waiting for the slaughter). Still, Halloween '18 is uber-memorable. It gets the ""bloody"" job done while being one of the more sophisticated entries in the Halloween film franchise.As the equivalent of meat and potatoes film-making for the horror-salivating millennials, Halloween is like J.J. Abrams helming The Force Awakens or Christopher Nolan cleaning up the cartoonish Batman chapters. No need to reinvent the wheel here and no need to dumb-down teen slasher mechanics.

94,justin-fencsak,A sequel worthy of being just as good as the first one...,7,24 January 2019,"In the beginning there was John Carpenter's Halloween. It became a massive hit and spawned numerous sequels, none of which failed to match the original. Even the remake and its sequel didn't do justice. Flash forward 40 years after it came out, David Gordon Green directed Halloween 2018 and became the highest grossing film in the franchise worldwide. This film is worthy of a buy.",Halloween
95,vengeance20,A Solid Film But Could've Been Better,8,21 October 2018,"Seen every Halloween film from the very start to this...on DVD of course! The first one was ok for its time, but not amazing but I am from the 90's so you can't blame for having that opinion. The others were a little better, but a lot of deaths were too restrained & weak. Halloween III is the worst, but that's no wonder. The remakes were the best (the 2007 one especially) and so 40 Years on we get a sequel that was in the making since 98'.The film picks up 40 years after the original in 78'. Laurie Strode is in isolation at a house that is locked up like Fort Knox. Loaded with guns & ammo in case Micheal comes back. Her daughter who now has a family of her own tries to break free from the paranoia her mum Laurie projected onto her all those years she was growing up. Micheal once again (while being transferred from another mental hospital) breaks free & escapes. 61 years old, he's back & kicking after 40 years & wants revenge, killing everyone in their paths as he does so!I thought the film was pretty solid, not to mention slick & modern! It was shot well & had a decent amount of deaths & story. But I can't help but feel as though the film could've been better. The pacing of the film for one was a little slow to start, picked up momentum & then slowed down by the final act. Too much suspense & character development & not a lot of deaths (though there were some good ones).Another complaint was the deaths, while they were awesome & some pretty decent kills were seen here & there, I felt the deaths were a little bit restrained & hidden from the audience, the shy away kind of feeling the camera did & the behind-the-camera-off-screen-deaths. I personally feel as though the 18+ rating wasn't taken advantage of as I wanted to see some pretty vicious blood thirsty kills! The scene at the party would've been perfect for that. I really wanted to see Micheal Myers really let loose in this film & he sadly didn't exactly let loose enough! There could've been more kills as the deaths in the film weren't all bad! It kind of reminded me of Meg in a way...!The all females surviving at the end was a bit annoying. 2018 & they still go with that dated crap. But the film overall made up for that. The ending was pretty good, but again I felt the other characters & their story arcs were lost & forgotten about by the time the end came.But overall I did quite enjoy the film! Aside from the negatives, it was a decent slasher with some violent deaths, but the film could've been a little bit better! Go watch it for yourself! 8/10",Halloween

98,Foutainoflife,Laurie Goes Doomsday Prepper,6,22 December 2018,"I must admit that the Halloween franchise is not one of my favorites. The movies have been a jumbled mess of inconsistencies that are just too numerous to forgive. This is supposed to be THE SEQUEL and should fall into place as the third film.It's not awful but it's not great. Michael is supposed to be transported from one facility to another but a wreck frees him to kill again on, get this, Halloween. Laurie has spent the last 40 years living as a nutty survivalist to the point where she has become estranged from her daughter and granddaughter. Her home is like a gangster's hideout. That's the basic plot.I will say that Michael seemed to be a bit more of an attacker in this film whereas in the others he's been a stealthy stalker first. I didn't just out right hate this but I'm not impressed. I'm not sure if this is an attempt to revive the franchise or if this was to kinda finish off the series but I had hoped it would've been better.",Halloween
99,Abdulxoxo,Too many Inconsistencies,6,4 February 2021,"The positives from this movie is Curtis, she played her part really well. I think the idea that Laurie has become this paranoid badass was a decent concept, which Curtis fully embraced. It was a new side of the character which we hadn't seen before. There was also a kid called Julian who was pretty funny. As he was being babysat he came out with a few lines that made me chuckle. As for the film itself, for an R rated slasher movie this was not in the least bit scary. There was barely any tension; there was absolutely no atmosphere; and I didn't jump once, not even a flinch. For a film like this to not be at all scary is unforgivable. The big problems is that it tried to fit in too many storylines unnecessarily. All we needed was Laurie and Michael, plus a few disposable side characters for Michael to kill. Instead, director David Gordon Green decided that we needed another doctor to basically take the place of Donald Pleasence's Dr Loomis from the original. The new guy, Dr Sartain has a side story that added nothing important to the plot; and also failed to go anywhere after the reveal. He was pointless. This movie also focuses on Laurie's granddaughter Allyson and her friends. There's a whole storyline with her boyfriend and an unrequited love interest, which there was no need for whatsoever. The whole time we were following the teenagers around all I wanted was for the film to get back to Laurie and/or Michael. The same could be said at the beginning when we meet a couple of investigative journalists/podcasters, who were there purely to give us exposition and be a ridiculously implausible plot devise. The characters make so many unbelievably stupid decisions. Smart people doing things that are incredibly dumb. In addition, decisions were made by the filmmakers which resulted in plot holes everywhere. One scene that I can mention is a 2 or 3 minute scene in a cop car where two cops discuss a sandwich. Literally that's all that happens for what reason I don't think even the filmmakers could justifiably explain. It summed up what a truly stupid mess this film was. On the whole, this movie was pointless. There were so many terrible decisions made. The fact that it gave Jamie Lee Curtis her first decent film role in quite a while is a positive, but not enough to make this movie's existence worthwhile.",Halloween
100,m-47826,Party pooper. What a mess...,1,21 October 2018,"What did you do to the genre, you hipster wanna be big name director(s)?! Where is the tension? The suspense? The thrills? All I saw was a cross between an indie flick and a found footage film. Through the tone it took, the interactions between characters, the so called deep dialogues and characterizations. Give us back the FUN. Stop taking yourselves too seriously. I'm completely disappointed by this. It's so underwhelming and pretentious. Indie horror at its worst. As someone who hates jump scares with a passion, I wished there were at least one or two, to check if I still had a pulse. Maybe it's the hype, and my own anticipation, but this wasn't at all what I had in mind. Like expecting candy, and being given moldy raisins instead. It maybe childish of me to say this, but that's what I wanted. The roller coaster ride feel, you get watching these kinds of movies. Not close-ups, slow motions (that god awful one, when Michael opens up the trunk, and puts on the mask...), and other « trendy » camera moves. Super deep conversations that feel more like monologues. Because the actors look completely distant from each other. Cold is the word, senseless even. And not in a setting the mood kind of way. But more like, actors being paid to say lines to one another. Speaking of which, some are criminally underused. Jamie Lee is back to being the original movie Laurie Strode, I agree. But she tries too hard to sell it.There's no unity. No complimentarity between the storytelling and the directing. In fact, it looks as emotionless as some reality TV shows, staging/reconstructing ""real"" events. In that case, why not go all the way, and build the movie as an imaginary documentary? With voice overs and all? Because it sure felt like one. I can't stress enough on how plain, tasteless and full of itself this movie is. So much so that even the meta elements look passionless. There, no passion, on all parts. Even the music placements. What a waste of a good idea, studios tried to ""brand up"" so only conceited viewers, who probably think It Follows and Get Out, are good horror movies. Can enjoy and rave about endlessly. Especially when it did exactly what those sequels, it so self righteously ignored, did too. In the worst way you could imagine...P. S: lots of footages aren't in the actual movie. Misleading trailers, check.",Halloween
101,arungeorge13,A slasher sequel that retains the vibe of the original to a great extent! [+65%],7,6 December 2018,"When you make a direct sequel to a cult classic that pretty much retcons all the other sequels, you better make it right! And thankfully, this applies to Halloween (2018). The first thing that the makers did right was to onboard John Carpenter as a composer, an executive producer, and a creative consultant. The film is directed by David Gordon Green and co-written by the director, comedian Danny McBride, and Jeff Fradley.The decision to bring back Jamie Lee Curtis to play Laurie Strode once again turned out to be a masterstroke as well. We don't see a 60-year old playing the (badass) lead in a slasher that often! Also, how the film manages to stay relevant in the modern day is also something worth studying. A character in the film even slyly remarks that serial killers aren't the world's biggest problems anymore (true indeed!).The direction is solid especially in the first two acts that let new viewers understand the ghastly psyche of Michael Myers as well as keep fans of the original cult-classic sufficiently interested (the old-school background score, the title credits, and more). Laurie Strode is still suffering from PTSD - the events from four decades ago still continue to haunt her - to the point that she has 'prepared' herself to face an attack from Myers at any time. She even keeps up with updates on Myers to ensure that her family is safe from his exploits.The screenplay is pretty intriguing too - the way Michael retrieves his mask, the historic second encounter between Strode and Myers in a classic home-invasion scene, and the climax - all are written keeping the original in mind. The recurring 'Halloween' theme (rendered by Carpenter & his son Cody) plays every time something vicious is about to happen - what's worse, it still manages to send a shiver down my spine every single time. I also liked how the film boiled down to Michael Myers and the three generations of women in Laurie Strode's family (herself, her daughter Karen, and grand-daughter Allison) even though there are quite a few male characters (such as Dr. Sartain, officer Hawkins, the boyfriends of Allison and her babysitter friend) occupying action-heavy scenes.The climax is also conceived and executed well (but we all know a sequel awaits!). I only wish the pacing was a little more even in the third act - the film turned action-heavy all of a sudden (and aspects like Myers stalking and appearing out of nowhere took a back-seat). Nonetheless, this is a worthwhile entry in the franchise and one that appears fresh even when it invokes memories of the original.",Halloween
102,martimusross,For The Fans And Buffs,6,27 October 2018,"This was a faithful sequel to the original movies and very much a homage to this kind of ripper movie. It would be unfair to expect more of this movie than of the original plots this movie spawned from, as such it was good, Jamie-Lee was great and I enjoyed it.However, it did feel quite dated and cumbersome to modern audiences who are used to a different palette of scare tactics. This was one for the fans clearly and on that level ticked every box.",Halloween

I've seen it a couple times now and I really appreciate what they did with it. That being said it's not the most entertaining. 4, 2 and h20 had more of a showstopper feeling. That being said it fits in well with its predecessor and finally moves the franchise forward. I still feel like the doctor's reasoning is a little forced as well as the whole face off. But it still works and he still has his eyes unlike any installment following the second movie. There's definitely still a bunch if fun here and some great scenes. The fun as l showdown is fun and the Babysitter attack is both hilarious and intensely scary. All in all it's a fun ride that really concludes the story satisfyingly even though there's two more films on the way.3.5/5",Halloween

105,Pumpkin_Man,The Ultimate Anniversary Gift For All Hardcore Halloween Fans!!!,10,19 October 2018,"Today was a big day for me. I was like a kid on Christmas morning, waiting hours to open the gifts. For those that know me, know that I absolutely love the Halloween series. I've watched and studied them for 20 years, ever since I was in 3rd grade. I've bought them all on vhs, dvd, and blu-ray. I've waited for this day for the last 9 years. Ever since Rob Zombie's Halloween II (Which I saw three times at the theater) When it was announced that we'd be getting a new Halloween film, I was ecstatic. The last few weeks, I've watched and re-watched the series. I think I've watched the original five times in the last month. My brain is literally turning into mush. Today, I was determined to see 'Halloween' at the very first showing at 7:00. I sat there through the trailers, getting really anxious.Finally, the movie started. I needed one of those brown bags to breath into when people hyperventilate, lol I tried my best not to blink too much. I have ADHD, so I usually tend to think about other things when I'm watching a movie, but for the most part, this movie had my full concentration. At no point was I ever bored. I just sat there and took it all in. I loved every single second of it. I was on 'Cloud 9' I was able to find quite a few of the Easter Eggs they hid for the hardcore Halloween fans. Remember, this film is a direct sequel to the original John Carpenter classic. None of the others exist anymore.The movie begins 40 years later after Michael's original massacre on Halloween night in 1978. Two true-crime podcasters, Aaron Korey and Dana Haines, travel to Smith's Grove Sanitarium to interview Michael Myers, who still refuses to speak. While being transferred to another asylum, the bus crashes and Michael Myers is loose again and returns to Haddonfield, Illinois to finish what he started. Laurie Strode springs into action, trying to protect her daughter Karen and granddaughter Allyson. She still suffers from trauma and PTSD and has a rocky relationship with her family. The kill scenes were pretty cool. There was actually one little twist that surprised me. I didn't expect it. It was random, and very interesting.I've loved the series since I was 8 years old, and my inner child is extremely happy. I couldn't have asked for a better Halloween movie. It was great seeing Jamie Lee Curtis fight Michael Myers again. It was great hearing that classic theme. I loved the new characters, and twists to the original classic I will definitely be seeing this again. I'd say it's now in my Top 5 favorite Halloween movies. Long live Michael Myers! I would definitely recommend HALLOWEEN!!!",Halloween

107,Stephen_A_Abell,Halloween? - Or How To Flush A Concept Down The Pan...,6,16 July 2019,"Why do people have to break things that don't need fixing(?) It annoys the hell out of me when someone decides, ""Hey that'll be a great idea?"" Well, guess what folks... most of the time it isn't. In this case, the writers were the ones with the ""Great Idea!!!"".The ""Great Idea"" is to forget all the sequels after Halloween II. I can see where they were coming from and what they were trying to do. However, they left in loads of character expansion material, which wouldn't have been there had the sequels not happened. The main one being the Michael and Lorie relationship. In this universe, Mikey has been incarcerated for 40 years. Yet Lorie is still so affected by that one night she believes Michael is tracking her and her family down. She even takes to training her daughter for the inevitable Halloween to come. Even after 40 years, this resolution has never wained. She's even constantly trying to force her ideas onto her daughter and her family.This woman should have been sharing a cell next to Sarah Connor and having her face licked too...All of this could have been worked into the history's timeline without the need to eradicate it and start anew; it would have even worked better since the previous films cement Michaels craving for patricide.This extermination also allows for many more holes and continuity errors. This is not the Halloween this fan had been hoping for. Story-wise H2O is much stronger and essentially the same premise.What does make this film worth watching is the direction. This is by far the shining light to the entire project. And the lighting technicians carry out some very awesome ambient scene-setting. It is a beautiful film to behold. There's some nice camera shots, pans and angles thrown into the mix to keep the audience watching... and is the only reason I kept my peepers on the screen. Even though Carpenter isn't directing there are lots of Carpenter'esq shots to keep fans happy and tripping.Then you, unfortunately, come to the acting... This varies from the subtle, Jamie Lee-Curtis, is okay as Lorie but isn't as strong as in previous characterisations - this I believe is because of the way the story unfolds. To the boring, Greer is nothing but a yawn fest. Even when she's in worried mom mode, you just don't care. Even though there's a lot of volume, there's very little substance. Shame, because she's better than this. Oh god, then there's her husband - Mr Inappropriate. He's only in this little tale to add some humour, though the writers really couldn't write anything funny so they added toilet humour, ""I've got peanut butter on my penis!"" Which would have been true... and slightly funny, had his penis not been behind trousers and underwear. The only pricks in this scene are the writers. Next, you have the investigative reporters who know nothing about investigating or getting the best from their interviewee. How these numpties won any awards is beyond me. But the worst character by a long shot is the doctor, who is nothing but a cut-rate Loomis and is played as such.If you're new to the Michael Myers story then leave this film alone and do yourself a favour, go watch the originals. Carpenter still does it better. Even the sequels (except the abysmal Busta Rhymes one) are more enjoyable.However, if you love films and filmmaking then give this a try as the direction and lighting should keep you watching and feeling happy - It did me.",Halloween

109,one9eighty,"@Hollywood ""Just leave it alone, please!""",5,15 June 2020,"This film picks up 40 years after the initial John Carpenter film, thus dismissing anything that happened after that fateful night when Michael Myers turns up in Haddonfield and wipes out a bunch of teenagers. Laurie Strode (JL Curtis) is back and has been preparing for a lifetime to face Myers again, she's had a family along the way and they have all been engrained with the skills on how to combat the masked psychopath. Myers escapes his incarceration and predictably goes on a rampage again.I had high hopes for this film but it was somewhat of a let-down for me. Dismissing its past, no matter how chequered the franchise was, felt wrong. It felt throughout the film that it had been created just to bleed more money out of the characters and concept, remarketing it for new audiences - but not really bringing anything new to the series. Low and behold, a quick internet search revealed that a trilogy of new films (including this one) have been agreed - will the next new film dismiss this 2018 entry the same way it has dismissed its own history? The characters in the film felt 2D at times, no real depth and throw away lines in a poor script. I'm sure the actors did well but the issue has to be what material they were provided with to do their job. While some of the deaths in previous Halloween films were at times tongue in cheek and creative, there was no such invention here - they were just brutal for brutal sake - have audiences moved on and left me behind? A lot of the vehicular actions to the plot felt too forced and artificial, leaving me with a lot more questions than answers by the end of the film. Why was Michael transported with low level loonies? Who on earth gave the reporters the mask to shove in Michaels face? Who on earth lets reporters taunt inmates like they did? Why aren't police forces called in sooner, or with more of an arsenal knowing what Myers did last time? What motivation did the doctor have for his heel turn?I'm sure some people will enjoy this film, for myself, somebody who has invested time and money in the franchise prior to this film, I'm extremely underwhelmed. I can only give this a 5 out of 10. I only hope the new sequels due from 2020 go some way to restore my faith.",Halloween
110,educallejero,"A great ending, but a boring movie",4,27 February 2020,"Although, I have to say, I don't like the original. I know how important and influential it is (and it does have some incredible things like the mask, the mystic ""inexplicable evil"", the score), but when I saw it (two times), I just didn't like it and I got bored. With that said, I can now say about this one, that it feels as inconsistent as the original, although because of different reasons. The first one is boring because of the extreme patience, here we have way too much ""action"" and Myers killing, but without the brutality expected. Half the deaths are off-screen and the other half are a bit ""soft"" (for the most part). Besides that, we see Michael without the mask (even if for seconds) and with old hands, and together I felt they took away from that supernatural invincibility he looked he had.The ""dramatic"" story is about three generation of women affected in their lives and relationships with each other, all because of this killer. While amazing in concept, it wasn't well executed. The stories of these women didn't flow into each other, making them with less scenes and time than required, obviously being more blunt and forced. Maybe they should've used all the time given to the pointless couple of podcasters that start the first act.With that time, maybe those stories feel more real with better spaced, scripted and acted scenes, and growing the story to the point of making the final really impactful and emotional instead of just ""cool"".",Halloween
111,phanthinga,The night he TRULY came home.....again,9,14 December 2018,I'm enjoyed pretty much all Halloween sequels and spin off that I saw until now so with Halloween (2018) I went into the movie with low expectations even though I already know there must be something very special about this movie when it finally got Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode and Nick Castle the original man behind the white mask Michael Myers again after all those years and the result is a satisfy blood soaking slasher movie that I very much love for it to get a sequel.Laurie as you know is the perfect example of a final girl in horror movie done right and she now as a grandma in this movie is pure badass when she face to face with Michael in the best final showdown between good and evil of the Halloween franchise that I can think of since H20.,Halloween
112,RforFilm,"The Boogyman is back along with Jamie Lee Curtis in the welcome return of Halloween, a genuine continuation of the Michael Myers story",8,19 October 2018,"When it comes to horror franchises, the Halloween series has had several spins that have attempted to amplify the actions of it's monster, Michael Myers. We've seen him get blown to bits by Dr. Loomis, Have a trilogy encounter with his niece with Halloween 4 through 6, we've seen him go after Laure Strode again in Halloween: H20 and Resurrection, and even Rob Zombie gave a grindhouse take in his remakes of Halloween and it's sequel. Each sequel and reboot has tried to explain the actions of Michael Myers and what his purpose is in going after people. It almost never works because unlike Freddy Krugger, Leatherface, and Jason Voorhees who have motives, Myers has no motive; he is nothing but evil.Most psychologists can agree that while morale is a big part of the human conscience, there are individuals who are so warped and impaired that the evil things they do are only what they know and will only know that until they die. Monsters are real and the serial killers and rapists who do these chaotic actions are all they know. Michael Myers is an example of a monster whose is a human shark whose only purpose is to hunt and kill. Though we can't progress his character, we can try again with Laurie Strode in the new sequel Halloween.Forty years after the first Halloween, Michael Myers has been held at a prison where he doesn't respond to anything, not even his new doctor, Dr. Sartain. The only thing that does seem to work is when two murder podcasters Dana and Cameron arrive, and pull out his old mask. Though he still doesn't say anything, the entire prison population starts to laugh and dogs start barking. He's due to be transported to a new prison later that day.In Haddonfield, Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is still suffering PTSD and has spent years living in isolation, preparing her home and personal skills in case Michael ever came back. Her adult daughter Karen (played by Judy Greer) is worried about her mother's mental state, but her teen granddaughter Allyson (played by Andi Matichak) only wants remain close. Halloween arrives once more, with Laurie feeling that something is feeling bad in the air. Her premonition is correct as the police discover the bus transporting Michael Myers has stopped and he escaped, along with his mask. Laurie makes her stand and prepares with her second encounter with The Shape.Something does feel eerie in the air tonight, as the new Halloween is really good. What it also does is make me question my opinion of the original Halloween. Let's take it one step at a time. Director David Gordon Green does an amazing job, not only shooting this, but keeping the movie with a pace and tone that is so similar to the John Carpenter classic, that this feels like a genuine continuation. Many sequels try to modernize and update the environment, but the movie balances that well with the suspense that hangs for the majority of the story.Though she had already made a comeback with Halloween: H20, Jamie Lee Curtis seems in a more likely position her character would be in. Being pursued by a serial killer would make her into a survivalist. Her performance reminded me of Linda Hamilton from Terminator 2: Judgment Day, in which both of their characters have evolved to a point where they are almost equal to their enemies. What separates her from Sarah Connor is that Laurie Strode knows that her killer is so evil and inhumane that only she knows that Michael Myers has to die. Halloween understands her point of view and Jamie Lee Curtis does great playing her again.Remember when I said that this made me reconsider my opinion of the original? That's because I said that I found the old Halloween overrated. The new movie's pacing that half plays out like a traditional slasher and the other half being a crime thriller, was exactly what John Carpenter's movie did. The slow pacing really added that extra tension to make Michael Myers a human shark and that's what the original did too. The new Halloween simply brings it back to that, but throws in some twists that I wont spoil.I'll give this eight Michael Myers knives out of ten. Halloween is a lot of fun that should help please old fans wanting to see Jamie Lee Curtis again go after The Shape and younger fans wanting to understand what originated the slasher genre. This is unlikely to have many people disliking it other then it not being their thing. All I can say is to go see and make that terrifying return to Haddonfield",Halloween

114,Anurag-Shetty,This 'reboot-quel' honors the original & surpasses it.,10,26 October 2018,"Halloween continues with the story of Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis). Forty years after the events of Halloween(1978), Laurie is still traumatized by that horrific night. When Michael Myers escapes captivity, Laurie will once again have to face the evil being she barely escaped from, on Halloween in 1978.Halloween is a non-stop, pulse-pounding, edge of the seat thrill ride. Writer-director David Gordon Green & co-writers Danny McBride & Jeff Fradley have done complete justice to the 1978 classic. It was a genius move to completely disregard all sequels & just make a direct sequel to the much loved John Carpenter horror/thriller game changer, that inspired so many other famous horror/thriller franchises. This film would be incomplete without the iconic background score of John Carpenter. The anticipation & suspense in each scene, just adds to the overall experience of the movie. The climax is jaw-dropping. Jamie Lee Curtis is mind-blowing as Laurie Strode. Even after all these years, Curtis still brings the same intensity, vulnerability & gravitas she brought to her iconic character in all her previous portrayals. Judy Greer is spectacular as Karen. Andi Matichak is outstanding as Allyson. James Jude Courtney & Nick Castle are superb in their mostly physical portrayal as The Shape. Haluk Biliginer is great as Dr. Sartain. Will Patton is excellent as Officer Hawkins. Rhian Rees & Jefferson Hall are brilliant as Dana Haines & Aaron Korey, respectively. Toby Huss, Virginia Gardner, Dylan Arnold, Miles Robbins, Drew Scheid & Jibrail Nantambu are perfect as Ray, Vicky, Cameron Elam, Dave, Oscar & Julian, respectively. Halloween is a must watch for fans of Halloween(1978). After years of mediocre/disappointing sequels, we finally get the Halloween(1978) follow-up we deserve. Go for it, as soon as possible!",Halloween
115,fernandoschiavi,"""Halloween"" is a sequel that commits to establishing all the necessary bridges with the first films of the franchise, ignoring the confusing paths it has taken over the years",6,5 September 2021,"In Handonfield, Strode lives relatively close to his daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak). While the daughter, married to Ray (Toby Huss), lives an apparently peaceful and healthy life, troubled by the suffocating and unbalanced presence of her mother, tormented by the traumas of the past, the granddaughter seems to be much more patient and understanding with her grandmother. Thus, history gains greater density and unity by presenting us with different generations in symbiosis, in a constant search for understanding the phenomena and events that enter our lives and prevent us from directing things exactly as idealized.As expected, on October 31st, Michael Myers is transferred along with a group of inmates. Under the care of Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), pupil of Dr. Loomis, Donald Pleasence's character in the previous films, the unwanted assassin escapes and heads to Handonfield, with his 40-year-awaited settling of scores with Laurie Strode and awakened by the provocations of Aaron Korey (Jefferson Hall), documentary filmmaker who, when visiting Myers in prison, wears the mask and cites his ""almost victim"" Strode, which somehow awakens the character's monstrosity, forcibly contained by the treatments and closure in the psychiatric institution.Efficiently directed by David G. Green, Halloween was scripted by the filmmaker, in partnership with Jeff Frodley and Danny McBride, playwrights who were inspired by the characters of John Carpenter and Debra Hill, but developed their own development in an attachment to the 1978 film that does not make it subservient, on the contrary, it presents the viewer with the ideal way of providing a new look at ""creatures"" that have inhabited the cultural imagination for four decades. And most importantly, forget the full answers to everything. Since his appearance in the film industry, Michael Myers has been pure evil, an assassin who kills randomly, without the need for exhaustive explanations that contemplate the reasons that made him the brutal murder machine. The director respects the established bases, establishes new rules - after all, it's been forty years separating the two, a small update was needed - and gives a new vision to a subgenre that hasn't offered much renewal, even though this is the top priority here. In essence, the film wears the mask (pardon the pun) of ""more of the same"". All the rules involving tormented killer movies are here. But Green manages to work with them satisfactorily, supported by a script that doesn't seek to reinvent the wheel.The big problem with the script written by the trio is that all these ideas, and others, are not explored at all. The film doesn't define its true focus, switching between Laurie and Myers and not delving into either.Any discussion of the slasher genre itself is evaded with a few graphic deaths or a moment of misplaced family drama. Laurie's relationship with her daughter, granddaughter and Michael Myers himself is a really interesting discussion that is summarily brushed aside. On the positive side, the moment of intergenerational female empowerment, putting mother, daughter and granddaughter together to overcome a terror from the past. In the end, there is nothing new, Halloween (2018) has some good ideas, but if you want, take the trouble to explore them. A shame as Green's direction tries their best to emulate Carpenter's signature style in the original feature, which is great seeing as it's one film that complements the other.However, he doesn't just rely on that and tries to bring new things. The result? Some very well directed suspense scenes, like the sequel where Michael attacks two houses at once and we follow it in real time. The icing on the cake is the presence of the soundtrack, signed again by John Carpenter. It's impossible not to get carried away when the classic theme song starts playing. Michael is brutal and visceral, with violence equivalent to the Rob Zombie remake, so you can expect some pretty graphic deaths. We have skulls crushed in the kick, heads cut off like Halloween pumpkins, knife through the throat and much more. Some deaths are references to other films in the franchise, such as the boy trapped in the wall by the knife, and that makes Halloween a more rewarding experience for fans.The director's partnership with Danny McBride in the script still yielded good moments of humor, which alleviate in the midst of building so much tension. The choice of Judy Greer and Andi Matichak are also perfect: the first with a desperate agony in front of her mother's behavior, and the second, honoring the milestone of the first film, which chose an unknown teenager to play the student. But none of this would have such an impact without the strength of Jamie Lee Curtis: back to her perfect role, the actress brings the touches of madness and exaggeration without caricatures, and thrills in the portrait of a strong and mature Laurie Strode.In this 2018 version, as much as the film has a super eighties vibe and recreates scenes as a tribute to the classic, the plot knows the power of the clash between the main duo and builds its narrative on top of it: in the plot good guys and bad guys don't they are easily identified and the script shows how disturbed Laurie was by the attack years ago, and that in the end it ended up damaging the girl's entire relationship with her family. As the character says at one point, her preoccupation with preparing for Michael's release from prison prevented her from a healthy relationship with her daughter (Judy Greer) and later with her granddaughter (Andi Matichak) even though it left her on alert. To face the great threat of a new encounter with the serial killer. But, after all, who has been in prison all this time, Michael in a physical prison behind bars or Laurie in her paranoia-ridden mental prison? Halloween answers that question in a script that takes a long time to get into gear, where at first Laurie is a person who suffers from post-traumatic stress and Michael is a prisoner inside a flawed system that facilitates his escape. And so, we see who starts hunting who, where only in its final half hour does Halloween mesh and show us a frantic dispute over who is the smartest, who knows best how to deal with the threat of the other and, of course, whose best developed a plan over these years.Another important point of Halloween is the soundtrack as one of the threads for creating a dense atmosphere. John Carpenter updated the theme, along with Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies. Considered a theme composed of few notes, but with a significant semantic load, the soundtrack was covered with synthesizers and gained a contemporary sound, without losing its impact on the construction of fear in the narrative. Allied to the visual aspects, the soundtrack gains body and expressiveness. Signed by Richard A. Wright, production design invests in opaque colors and gloomy surroundings, without bright colors that convey hopeful feelings. With scenography by Missy Berent Ricker and art direction by Sean White, the film gives the person in charge of photography the circulation spaces for the characters, in a calculated expression of their dimensions (physical, psychological and social), as well as their dramatic needs.References to the original are also scattered throughout, whether in small easter eggs in the mise-en-scène, to visual rhymes that take on an important narrative function. In this sense, the highlight is the final sequence, which reproduces the third act of the first film, reversing the roles of Myers and Laurie. More than a simple tribute, we are seeing the relationship between prey and predator and how one was influenced by the other, even though they were apart for forty years. At the same time, Laurie abandons the final girl title for good and chooses to go on the attack, even though she is affected by the past.But while in the 1978 work we see an almost restrained Michael Myers, who demonstrates to have some selectivity regarding the victims (the body count in the film does not total a ten), here it is possible to feel that the imprisoned years accumulated the desire for the killing. And just like in the past, when Carpenter and Debra Hill created a script that doesn't explain the villain's motivations, here it just gains momentum. There is no longer the puritanical aura of the assassin that only kills young people by having sex (one of the updates that the script is concerned with applying). This time, Myers attacks anyone who is inattentive in front of him, making him a constant threat. In his first attack on Halloween night, we see this through a beautiful sequence-shot, which delivers to the audience information that the characters don't know about the villain's presence, leaving us in doubt about the fate of the people on screen.""Halloween"" is a sequel that commits to establishing all the necessary bridges with the first installment of the franchise, ignoring the confusing paths it has taken over the years. Without wasting time, with a few sentences in agile and non-expository dialogues, we are informed about what happened with dr. Loomis, the relationship between Myers and Laurie, among many other pieces of information presented in different timelines. In an excellent demonstration of respect for the classic, this film sticks to form, but walks autonomously, having little dependence on the previous chapter.",Halloween
116,joebloggscity,Homage to the original with another reboot....,3,4 November 2019,"Here we go again, but this time they have tried to up the quality. Another anniversary celebration of the seminal classic, but really this one is not much better than many other slasher movies that have come in it's wake.Jamie Lee Curtis paints by numbers in her role in a reboot that just dismisses all the other reboots and follows on 40 years after the original (why?). Next her character is supposedly Sarah Connor of suburbia, but yes Michael Myers has escaped and is chasing down her child and grandad nad and you get the picture.The scares aren't that scary, various references to the original, the acting poor, the killings graphic and so on. The twists themselves aren't flattering or convincing. I was bored. Surprised by the general positive reception this received but maybe that's to do with respect being paid to the original. Being better than the other sequels is hardly praise (although some of them had their moments).Michael Myers will come back again for more reboots and sequels in one form or another.

Many of them has strange stories which made no sense and some moments that were simply WHAT THE!!!!Now we have a new Halloween which has ignored all of the sequel and one that carries the story to present day, but...........Yes this film has followed the trends of the sequels it has ignored with a silly story that is just!!!!!!As usual I won't give spoilers away, so;
How did Michael know where the daughter was going to be later that night?
The house she ran to, who's was it, it wasn't her families?
1 hour and 15 minutes into the film! Psychologist??? Why???
Turn the lights on!
Why was the film so hung up on Michael talking?
The PC brigade were also out in force with the coolest kid in school wearing a skirt, the boy wanting to dance rather than hunt.
I could go on.Many people may say I'm just picking faults but I personally feel the film makers should credit us with some intelligence.Don't get me wrong I did enjoy this film but the silly story just made me want to slap my forehead.Not the best and certainly not the worst compared to some of the sequels but don't make a special journey to go and see this.Rating 6 out of 10",Halloween

119,bob-the-movie-man,"""He's waited for me; I've waited for him"".",8,30 October 2018,"There's such a familiarity with the content of these films that it's difficult to put yourself back in 1978 for Jamie Lee Curtis's original battle with Michael Myers when the teen-slasher genre was in its infancy. Arguably ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" four years earlier booted the 70's/80's genre; but thanks to its huge success John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" opened the flood-gates... or should I say, blood-gates.40 years after the terrifying events of Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael Myers is still mute and incarcerated in a psychiatric unit being studied by Dr Sartain (Haluk Bilginer). He is joined by two investigative journalists - Aaron Korey (Jefferson Hall) and Dana Haines (Basingstoke's-own Rhian Rees: ""Where are your loos?""... classic!). They are keen to reunite Myers with his nemesis Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to watch the fireworks.Strode is unfortunately damaged goods: still mentally traumatised and with failed marriages and a child taken into care, she lives in a fortified home in the middle of the woods. But she knows she has a date with destiny. As Halloween 2018 approaches, an 'incident' puts Myers on a collision course with Haddonfield's teenage population all over again.Wow... you forget what an effective actress Jamie Lee Curtis is and here she absolutely owns every single scene she's in, bringing enormous energy to the screen as the paranoid but ever-prepared hunter-in-waiting. The original Halloween was Lee Curtis's movie debut and the film that made her a household name, and it almost feels like this is a passion-project for her to say ""thanks for all the fish"" for her career. Impressive.As her eye-rolling daughter, Judy Greer rather pales in comparison (I found her character is a bit whiny and annoying), but the acting stakes pick up again with Andi Matichak as the granddaughter Allyson.Of the other teens, Virginia Gardner is particularly effective as Vicky: the cute ""favourite"" babysitter who you can't help but empathise with.It's very easy to make a very bad slasher movie, but this isn't such a movie. Although having a wonderfully retro feel (when is the last time you saw ""traditional"" opening titles like this?) and despite mining every horror cliché known to man (ALWAYS look in the back seat when you get in a car!) it's all obviously been done with loving care by the director David Gordon Green.Above all, the director knows that what's more scary than seeing violent murders is what your imagination can visualise happening off-screen. Don't get me wrong, there is some SERIOUS gore meted out, with a few 'cover your eyes' moments. However, a good proportion of the violence is not shown, and very effective that is too, supported by Carpenter's classic and insistent theme and some kick-ass foley work to add spice to your imagination!The script (by the writing team of David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley) also wickedly plays with your darkest fear of where the plot *could* go if it wanted to: in a brilliant piece of misdirection (you'll know the scene) your ""OMG surely not"" nerves twang and then un-twang with relief.The script also works well to help you care about the teens on the menu, in much the same way as ""Jaws"" did with the tourists to Amity Beach.Where the plot nearly lost me was in a rather daft twist before the final reel (which actually made more sense of what happened in the first reel, but was still hugely improbable). The ship rights itself fairly quickly (if messily) and normal order is resumed for the finale it deserves.I'm not really a ""horror nut"" but this was popcorn horror of the best sort and I enjoyed it. Reverential to the original classic, it made for some entertaining reactions in the sparsely populated showing I attended: I imagine if seen in a packed auditorium on a Saturday night (or perhaps tomorrow night!) it would literally be a scream.One's thing for sure: when I got into my car in the dark cinema car park, I did take a sneaky look into the back seat!For the full graphical review, please look me up as One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

121,tonypeacock-1,Familiarity in these uncertain times,6,21 October 2018,"Familiarity in these dark times of Trump, Novichok poisoning and Brexit is not a bad thing.Franchise movies like (yet another) Halloween fall into this category like a Bond or Star Wars event.Just like the original forty years ago Jamie Lee Curtis plays Laurie Strode, a psychological wreck being terrorised by the demons of her brother Michael Myers.Myers introduced by John Carpenter in the 1978 classic I watched only last week is still wreaking havoc. A violent psychopath who does not speak and for some reason is still kept alive by the taxpayer of Illinois, U.S.This new version isn't directed by Carpenter (he contributes an Executive Producer credit and inspires the characters and music).
The director mantle falls to David Gordon Green who does an admirable job in keeping audience interest as strong as ever despite some pretty poor films beforehand.Lee Curtis looks visibly older. The years are taking there toll on us all!
Donald Pleasence was a mainstay of the franchise until his death in 1995 as Dr. Loomis. Myers doctor who studied him extensively and was the savant like character of the franchise.
The savant now is Dr. Sartain who even Laurie calls the ""new Loomis"". Sartain even has Pleasance voice.Myers death scenes (or are they?) would be ideal for Sean Bean given his record of painful cinematic death sequences.The film does the same as previous entries whilst still keeping the audience entertained.",Halloween
122,mikayakatnt,Cash grab w/o any new ideas -- pandering galore,2,5 March 2020,"The 2018 reboot of Halloween is what happens when you don't let good things die. Yet, like Michael Myers, the series can't seem to die. Everything that made the originals so good, this film disregarded.This is the first movie I debated on walking out on after paying for. I even tried to force myself to sleep through it at one point. It's that bad.I liked the brutality of the death scenes and the homages to the original films. But that is where the things I like about this movie end.Don't believe me? Watch the intro scenes before the title screen. It's anticlimactic. After that, the movie is a borefest of boring dialogue until Michael gets his mask. Expect about 30 minutes of endless talking before that happens.The film also writes out all the sequels past 1978. This by itself should be a crime. The writing-out makes Michael Myers seem to be another random serial killer. The obsession that people in the movie have towards him now makes no sense. There are worse serial killers than Michael Myers since 1978. This single writing out of past movies destroyed my suspension of belief. The Halloween universe now makes no sense.With the writing-out comes Laurie Strode's representation. This is a conflicting one for me. Though I appreciate the use of the original actor, her character makes no sense now. No explanation is made to how Laurie could afford her home and lifestyle. With someone who suffers from severe PTSD and paranoia, I doubt she could hold a job for long. Let alone affording all the things she has in the movie. Also, how would she know that Michael Myers is coming back? I understand the emotion involved, but she couldn't have been so prepared. The fact that she stayed so armed to the teeth removes a lot of tension.One thing that made the originals so scary was how defenseless each protagonist is against Michael Myers. Having someone who is trying to hunt him down removes a lot of suspense.Michael Myer's portrayal was one I didn't appreciate as much either. He seemed to be able to take damage more than he did in the other movies. The fact that he didn't seem as invincible as he was in the originals removed his aura of mystery and terror.Then there are the ""teenagers."" The selection of the ""teenage"" actors is terrible. These actors are already wrinkling and look like they're about to hit thirty. Their dialogue was cringe-worthy and reeks of pandering. Slang words are fake or outdated. Attempts at jokes were not funny. The party and dancing scenes is cringey at best. This movie could cut 90% of the high school scenes and nothing of value will be lost.While we're on the actors, let's talk about the deaths. While most were brutal and satisfying. Some deaths didn't make sense. There are places where people could have outrun Michael Myers. In such instances, the movie hides their deaths and shows dead bodies after. I know how Michael Myers walks, and it's not fast at all. Lazy writing if you ask me.Speaking of lazy writing, let's mention jumpscares. I hold special hate towards is unnecessary jump scares where no one is in danger. Those, to me, signal cheap thrills that are the same as a sucker punch. If I get a jumpscare, something crucial has to have happened. This movie has those unconsequential jumpscares, often.If you want real terror in horror movies, look at the ones who do suspense building well. The sense of not knowing what will happen next lead us to want resolution, even if it means scaring us. Imagine Alfred Hitchcock's ""bomb under the table"" example. This movie lacks the original tension building that the 1978 original did so well.One tool that helps build suspense is music. That's an area this film lacked in. Shame, since the original was so good at using a musical score to build suspense and add tension. The music score that made the originals so terrifying is not there in this movie. Plenty of scenes were lacking. ""Scary"" scenes are now no longer scary.I doubt I can go much further without spoiling the movie. But you get the picture.1/5. The film does too much pandering to fanboys instead of focusing on making a good movie. Cinemasins is going to have a field day with this one.",Halloween
123,kjproulx,Easily the Best Sequel this Franchise Will Ever See,8,19 October 2018,"As I've stated countless times in the past, the horror genre just isn't my cup of tea, but I've always had a soft spot for certain great ones. While I'm not someone who particular loves the Halloween franchise, I appreciate the original and a couple of its sequels as well. This latest instalment does a lot to ruin the franchise for fans of each and every one of the previous instalment, but if you're a film fan in general before strictly a horror fan, then I believe you can agree that most of the sequels are quite terrible and can trust when I say that this is easily the best sequel that this franchise has ever seen, and probably will ever see. While the title is confusing and the plot itself even more so, Halloween (2018) is definitely worth a watch.The filmmakers knew what the audience wanted to see a movie like this and the story definitely reflects that notion. Picking up 40 years after the original 1978 film and loosely ignoring all seven sequels, this film is the true send-off for the franchise (for now). Michael Meyers has been held in prison since the events of the original and he and Laurie have been waiting for each other if he were to ever escape. Well, it shouldn't come as any surprise to find out that that's the plot, plain and simple. Michael escapes and Laurie is prepared and waiting for him. Haunted by her past, while also trying to stay sane for her daughter, as well as her grandchild, the depth this film brings to the franchise is far greater than I was expecting.If you're looking for more than a film that pleases its fans and remains very faithful to the classic slasher tropes, then you may find yourself a little disappointed, but it really wasn't about that to me. Sure, it's fun to see Michael terrorize the town, but it was truly about a new generation having to fear this horrible figure of a man. I've always found something terrifying about a man walking around on Halloween night, wearing a mask and killing people, and that aspect was still present here. This movie is in no way original, but it tells a far more engaging story than I was expecting.Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, completely ignoring everything that her character went through in the previous sequels and coming up with a fresh take on what happened to her character after the events of the original. Personally, I loved that about the movie and her performance here may be even more devoted than she was in the original movie. Her performance, along with the addition of her family lineage, added up to a very enjoyable experience. As I said, this movie isn't anything original, but all of these elements almost made this the most likeable entry in the franchise, including the original.In the end, I had a great time with this movie and I truly haven't used those words to describe my experience with any of these movies in the past. I don't want to jump to conclusions here, but I think this may be my favourite Halloween movie in the franchise. From solid direction by David Gordon Green to a self-aware screenplay that winks at the audience on multiple occasions, to a very good score by the trio of John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter, and Daniel A. Davies, Halloween (2018) is a blast for fans of the franchise, horror fans in general, and newcomers. This movie does a great job of standing on its own, which is probably the best thing it has going for it. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one at the movies.",Halloween
124,DarthVoorhees,A very worthy spiritual successor to the Carpenter classic,8,7 November 2018,"This new Halloween is pretty good and comes very close to getting the spirit of the original Carpenter film. That being said it doesn't quite free it's self of the cliche trappings of a slasher film.The set-up to the film is really the strongest thing about it. I love the subplot of the podcasters as it is a really clever element to the story. Jefferson Hall and Rhian Rees are pitch perfect as NPR esque hipsters who poke this dormant geriatric monster until he wakes up. The movie should have followed them more because when Michael eventually starts hunting down teenagers it really loses a lot of the goodwill it built up.That really is my only complaint about 'Halloween'. It is so much more clever than so many slasher films and yet it develops these teen characters who are so predictable, so unmemorable, and really have no purpose but to be killed. One of the things that Carpenter's original 'Halloween' got so right was that he created fully developed characters who had personalities, motivations, and were played by actresses with screen presence. PJ Soles and Nancy Loomis have magnetism. We know more or less that their characters are doomed but we like them and fear for them. Part of what makes a great suspenseful horror film is having characters we fear for instead of sacrificial lambs getting gutted. You couldn't wait for little Drew Scheid's Oscar to meet his fate.I know a lot of reviews dislike Haluk Bilginer Doctor character. I liked him quite a bit because I think the Doctor role is necessary in the 'Halloween' series. There are so many great things about the original 'Halloween', it truly is a horror masterpiece. If you asked me what my favorite thing about it is though I would have to say Donald Pleasance. The character perfectly adds that sense of doom in just that right way that gets close to over the top but is still enduring. I'll watch some of the rougher 'Halloween' sequels for Pleasance. I think of Loomis as an eccentric Van Helsing character. And so since I can't have Loomis I'm glad I get a ""new Loomis"".I like the way this character eventually plays a major role in the story too as it definitely sort of surprised me.We had to have someone assist Michael in escaping on Halloween night. You couldn't just have a freak accident again. I like that Doctor Saritan wanted to recreate the massacre and turns from a Loomis stand-in into a mad man. I had a feeling Michael didn't get out on his own. I was sort of suspecting the podcasters might have had a hand in it. If they really wanted to pull a 'Last Jedi' they should have had Laurie set him free to hunt him.Jamie Lee Curtis is great. The character of Laurie has been through so much through the series and I felt like this film really is the first sequel to do her justice. It acknowledges the fear and turmoil she has gone though has harmed her loved ones but it doesn't make her weak or a victim. She's been waiting for Michael to kill him. It's a much more interesting characterization when compared to 'Halloween H20' where she's been almost paralyzed by fear. That being said I don't really like the retconning. It worked better when they were siblings. It gave Michael far more motivation and depth. Why does he care so much about hunting Laurie if he's just pure evil who has an impulse to indiscriminately kill?There will be a sequel but there really shouldn't be. The ending is pitch perfect. Michael staring defiantly at Laurie as he burns to death is just so chilling and in character.So in short when 'Halloween' delves into it's adult characters and the series rich mythology it's outstanding, you just have to endure some cliche teens getting cut up.",Halloween

I'm not a horror genre fan and I haven't seen any of the other instalments.The antagonist is Michael Myers, he is not a man, more a supernatural relentless, emotionless and completely evil killing machine. He escapes while being transported between prisons. The plot revolves around his hunt for Laurie, the only survivor from the first film. Laurie's house has become a heavily defended fortress with a secret basement. Michael gets trapped in the basement and is incinerated.This is a very violent, tense and brutal film.

126,Darkside-Reviewer,H20+20,7,4 February 2021,"I went to see Halloween (2018) in theatre's on it's day of release which coincidentally was the same day as my birthday. I have been a huge fan of the Halloween franchise and slasher movies in general since I was just a kid. I sadly never got to see a Halloween movie in theatre's when I was growing up at first it was because of the age rating. Then by the time I was old enough the only Halloween movie released was Rob Zombie's Halloween 2. I finally got to see a true Halloween film in theatre's which was always something on my Bucket list. And as an added bonus Halloween (2018) turned out to be the best Halloween film since Halloween 2 (1981).The Halloween franchise now has so many different time lines that it can get a little bit confusing to which movies take place in which timeline. Halloween (2018) for those that don't know takes place forty years after the events of the first Halloween (1978) film. This really helped the film in my opinion as over the past forty years the various sequels and reboots that have been released have made an absolute mess of the Halloween franchise again leading to a timeline so convoluted that it makes The Terminator timeline look simple by comparison.The main selling point for Halloween (2018) was of course the return of (Jamie Lee Curtis) who reprises her iconic role as Laurie Strode. This is now the second time in forty years that (Jamie Lee Curtis) has returned to the franchise to kill Michael Myers once and for all. (Jamie Lee Curtis) returned to play Laurie Strode for the twenty year anniversary of Halloween (1978) in (Halloween H20 20 Years Later) which was released in (1998). As much as I love the Halloween franchise I was actually hoping that Halloween (2018) was going to be the final movie in the franchise. I would like to see (Jamie Lee Curtis) kill Michael Myers once and for all like she was supposed to do twenty years ago in H20. There are still two more sequels to come so who knows maybe the next two movies will be amazing and will finally end the franchise with an actual final fight between Michael and Laurie the way it should end. I just don't wanna end up in another twenty years time watching Laurie and Michael fight while in wheelchairs.I highly recommend watching Halloween (2018) it's probably one of the best modern day slasher movies out there. If you enjoy watching slasher movies that are heavy on the violence, blood and gore then you will definitely enjoy this Halloween film.",Halloween

128,msbreviews,Rating: B-,6,26 October 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)My expectations for this sequel were slightly high. Jamie Lee Curtis returning to play her iconic role as Laurie Strode was something that instantly grabbed my attention as well as John Carpenter helping to produce this movie. The original flick is one of the 70s' classics and one of the most influential horror films of all-time, but the following installments were all, at least, disappointing.David Gordon Green's version has its ups and downs. For each aspect that I truly love about this film, there's another one that I hate. Being this his first horror movie, he tries to pay homage to the 1978's film without borrowing too much of it, but sometimes it does come off as a repetition of a scene we've watched before. However, every moment of nostalgia doesn't feel forced at all. He is able to always transmit something with these shots without them feeling like nostalgia for the sake of it.Jamie Lee Curtis is definitely a standout, and the way that she is able to incorporate Laurie is magnificent. She delivers a genuinely believable performance (something that was the original's major flaw, its acting) and Laurie is such a badass. I love the arc that this character went through during the 40 years since the escape of Michael Myers' killing attempt. She spent the whole period preparing for Myers' return, and she educated her whole family to be ready as well, creating relationship issues between the ones she cares about the most.This is the best part of the screenplay, but unfortunately, it doesn't become the main focus due to poor script decisions. Laurie and Michael's reunion is extremely well-built but at the cost of some nonsensical subplots and secondary characters that mean nothing to the story. Her granddaughter, Allyson (Andy Matichak), has a silly high-school romantic subplot that has no purpose whatsoever. Then, some meaningless characters who only work as exposition devices to remember everyone what happened in the original, also grab a big chunk of screentime, and they really don't have a significant impact in the story besides providing a scene where the audience can finally see Michael kill someone.I wrote ""finally"" because this movie takes a while to start and the tone of the film isn't well set. The first act is basically a rundown of what happened 40 years ago, and the script is heavy on lazy exposition. Once the movie starts to get its tone and atmosphere right, it outbalances itself by inserting comedy when there's no need to. Some lines you can just get past them, but some feel incredibly forced and ruin the tone.However, even with all of these issues, David Gordon Green is able to deliver some fantastic scenes. The trademark suspense and tension of the original is well present in this one as well. There are a lot of scenes with Michael going through houses, hiding behind doors and scaring people up, and they are (for the most part) very well-directed. I can't say they are scary, but if you're going to watch Halloween (2018) expecting to crap your pants, then you have no idea what a Halloween film is.It was never about the jump scares or the bloody deaths, even if the R-rating is more than required since it does elevate the killing scenes. The relationship that Laurie and Michael created is what kept me on edge until the end of the movie because those are the two characters that really matter. I do think they nailed the ending and I love that they kept Myers' most recognizable traits.As far as the acting goes, it's obviously way better than the original (if it wasn't, this would be a huge flop). Even if we can't see his face, Nick Castle returning to portray The Shape is always a plus. Besides Jamie Lee Curtis' brilliant performance, Judy Greer (Karen) and Will Patton (Officer Hawkins) stand out from the rest with good displays. Their characters still have enough screentime to provide a good scene here and there, but there's one character that I think is the biggest misstep of this whole thing.Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer) is supposed to be the new Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Michael's psychiatrist. Until the end of the second act, this character is just like the other secondary ones: he exposes a lot about Michael's backstory and talks about the evil that he carries inside him, etc etc. However, at the beginning of the third act, Green and his writers make a character decision that I honestly don't understand. I won't spoil anything, but it definitely comes out as a forced decision that changes the flow of the film.Technically, it's as good as it can be expected. Obviously, it can't be compared to the 70s' movie, but it surely has some great aspects. The use of the lighting to create some very suspenseful scenes is outstanding, and Carpenter's score is utterly unforgettable. It not only sets the atmosphere, but it truly elevates the tension building up to another Michael's killing scene.This could have been an amazing film. If they discarded the silly subplots and the meaningless characters, and focused on Laurie and Michael's meeting each other again, then this would have been a fantastic movie. I usually hate when directors start their films with text or narration, but in this case, where you're releasing a sequel 40 years after the original, I rather listen to 30 seconds of narration or waste one minute reading some text setting up this movie by explaining what happened in the first one than having to deal with these type of characters and their stupid side stories.All in all, Halloween (2018) has as many ups as it has downs. For every plot point they get right, there's another one they totally screw up. Jamie Lee Curtis is phenomenal as Laurie, and the build-up to her reunion with Michael Myers grabs the audience until the ending, which I do think David Gordon Green nailed. Technically very good, it's frustrating and a bit disappointing that so many other fails exist. Unnecessary comedy unbalances the film's tone, which takes time to set the right atmosphere. Meaningless secondary characters who only serve as plot devices take a big chunk of screentime and Green's screenplay decisions lack discernment. Overall, my positives slightly top my negatives, but only by a hair ...",Halloween

A psychopath serial killer, who is a prominent representation of Pure Evil!I haven't seen the original yet, so not gonna draw comparisons here. Although I know for a fact that this film picks a lot of good stuff from the original but nevertheless I will judge it as an Individual standalone film that mostly fails to deliver even with such strong premise. Under a more experienced director this could have been made better.David Gordon Green, the director tried to pay tributes to the cult classic as in many scenes his efforts are easily noticeable. But he failed to create a similar tensefill atmosphere. Although the Gore, The blood; if you love those sort of things; then you probably love it here. As those things are in abundance. Lot of kills and blood certainly make the plot standout on a violence heavy perspective! Otherwise the story goes on a predictable route that slowly took the pace up and towards the end provided some originality in terms of content! Except Jamie Lee Curtis, the guy or guys who played Michael; others were terribly bad. Bad writing and badly timed humour is the reason for that. The dialogue writing was just trash. The characters were so bland and dumb that I couldn't care less.Let's talk about some technicalities now. Cinematography looked pretty decent; giving homage to the previous film as you might have already guessed. Such as some tracking scenarios; they were shot pretty well! Sound score also gave a vibe of nostalgia and to be frank I liked that.As a whole, this one as a slasher horror isn't that bad nor is it any good. It just lays in between as a typical mediocre film that shines in bits and pieces but fails in too many aspects that can't be simply ignored.",Halloween

133,Alexander_Blanchett,Welcome Back to Haddonfield,8,27 October 2018,"Laurie Strode turns into Sarah Connor. An interesting concept for a sequel to John Carpenter's classic form 1978 which disregards all other existing sequels.
For being exactly that, I was a bit left cold as I hoped we would get more background infos of what happened in the Halloween night and 1978 and why. But yeah I get it they want to make Michael Meyers killings random and I guess that is how it is. But I loved the motive of the hunter and his game which was introduced by director David Gordon Green and I really like that they characterized Laurie as both the hunter and the game as well as Michael as the hunter and the game. There were many ambitious twists and some genius references which made the film absolutely interesting to watch and make it perfectly work as not only a sequel or remake but also an homage to the original one. In what Green and Danny McBride succeed as well was to give ""The Shape"" more character.
Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and I liked how she went with her character. It was. really a wonderful performance and one the best I have ever seen in a slasher film like that. Judy Greer was fine as well but I found they underdeveloped the ""new"" Laurie And Matichak a bit.
The only critic I really find in this sequel is that it sometimes felt a bit too rushed and some characters fates are never really disclosed or further touched. Other than that it was a great ride and revisit to Haddonfield.",Halloween

The new Halloween does stand on its own though with an effective use of steady cam and a brilliant reimagined score. Michael is as scary as ever.

135,apryla-58795,Guess we'll have to wait another 40 years for a good sequel,1,4 November 2018,"The original Halloween is a classic...this is not. I do not understand the great reviews. I had heard how great this was so despite not being to a movie theatre in 3 years I went to see it. Big mistake. I'm really disappointed that I wasted my time and money on this bomb. Usually I feel that most movies have potential or that they start out strong but finish poorly. Halloween had neither going for it. As soon as the movie started I felt a sense of dread but not because the movie was scary; it was because I just knew it wasn't gonna be scary or good. The film seems disjointed and you don't get a sense of these characters so therefore you feel nothing towards them. When I read that Danny McBride co-wrote this I thought it was a joke but I kept an open mind. Turns out he's not only not funny but he also can't write a horror film. You would have thought there would have been a lot of individuals wanting to take on this script for a movie with this much history.This movie picks up where the last one ended to a degree. We hear about how Laurie Strode's life unfolded throughout the past 40 years in conversation only. She's had 2 failed marriages and had her daughter taken away from her when the daughter was young due to Laurie's paranoia. Laurie has spent the last 40 years fortifying a house in the event Michael comes after her again.The movie starts out at the psychiatric facility Michael has been housed in for the last 40 years. Why they needed to move him after all that time is a mystery but they had to do something in order to make a movie so that's what they chose. Laurie's relationship is strained with her daughter and she rarely sees her granddaughter.Two unnecessary journalists pay a visit to Michael before he is transferred. They have obtained Michael's mask and pull it out and try to show him and to get some type of response out of him but he does not take the bait.They leave and go pay Laurie a visit at her home. She lets them onto her property after they bribe her with $3,000.00. They try to get her to talk about her life since the attack 40 years ago. She tells them very little and asks them to leave.Laurie goes to the facility on the night Michael is transferred to watch his bus take off to the next facility. The logical thing would have been for her to follow the bus to its final destination but nope she doesn't. Somehow (they don't show it of course because they couldn't come up with anything) the bus gets tipped over and Michael escapes but not before he hangs around long enough to kill a few people including a young boy. That scene was totally unnecessary. I also love that they had to throw political correctness in that small scene between the young boy and what looked like his great-grandfather but was really his father. The boy talks about how he loves to hunt but he is also currently really into dance lessons (see what they did there? A man can be a hunter AND a dancer-ok so? Why take time to point out the obvious? Must of felt like they had to take advantage of their soapbox because they know that mostly teens and lower income folks would make up a large portion of the audience and they figured that demographic needs to be taught about tolerance and acceptance - puh-lease!)After Michael goes on his first killing spree he's off to somehow find the exact location of the journalists who are trying to do a podcast about Michael & Laurie. The male journalist pumps gas and the female goes to the bathroom. Michael magically appears and starts killing all the gas station workers without anyone noticing or hearing anything. Michael goes to the bathroom and starts to kill the female journalist. She screams for help-enter male journalist who gets smashed to bits and then the female is finished off. Michael checks those two off his list and proceeds to use his mental GPS to track down his next unnecessary victims.Kids are running around for trick or treat. Laurie Strode's granddaughter has friends who are terrible actors. They go to a house to babysit a kid who was the best part of the movie and proceed to get killed by Michael as well. The kid has intelligence so he gets out while the getting is good and Michael is denied another kill.Laurie's granddaughter gets a special award for good grades so she invites Laurie to dinner to celebrate at what looks like an old Pizza Hut. She has her boyfriend (who turns out to be a jerk) with her to meet the fam. They are all laughing and loving life until Laurie shows up and proceeds to have a full on mental breakdown.The granddaughter is not great in this. There was a lot of interest in Hollywood for this role and they decided that instead of talent or using Jennifer Morrison or Rey from Star Wars (which is exactly what this newcomer looks like a cross between) they'd go with this no name talentless young hopeful who will no doubt be cast in everything for the next year then be cast aside for someone newer or younger.There is a school Halloween dance. The jerky boyfriend throws the granddaughter's phone in the punch bowl and there you have it-she now won't be able to be contacted by her family who is trying to tell her to get home cause Michael will surely find her and want to kill her even though he's never seen or met her before.Granddaughter and annoying boyfriend's unnecessary sidekick (who looks like Barb from Stranger Things twin IRL) walk home from party. He puts moves on her she freaks out and leaves. Sidekick gets impaled by Michael. Granddaughter runs away screaming down the street banging on doors making sure Michael can find her every step of the way. She finally gets someone to let her in. The parents come get her but the sheriff and the doctor from the institution need her to help them find Michael. They drive around she sees him and they run him over. The doctor undergoes a mental break himself and kills the sheriff and then drags Michael into truck with granddaughter. Michael comes to and kills the doctor. The granddaughter runs into the woods.Michael comes to Laurie's house and kills the granddaughter's dad and then goes after Laurie and her daughter. They hide in the basement but after a few seconds Laurie decides ""hmmm this movie is not gonna go anywhere if we stay down here like logical people would so I'm gonna go explore the house so I can get beat up a bit and thrown out a window"". She searches the house in a scene so long and drawn out I feel mad that I didn't bring my nail polish. I could have painted my nails twice in the time it took for her to track down Michael.The granddaughter somehow finds her way through the woods at night with no light to the fortress. She and her mom go in the basement. Michael once again uses his ESP or telepathy or whatever to go right to the hidden area in the kitchen and proceeds to rip away the entire counter that is covering their hiding place even though he's had two of his fingers blown off, been run over and shot. The daughter pretends she can't shoot him as a ploy, Michael appears and she shoots him...again. Ok great he's dead...wait! Not just yet because Laurie has to get her licks in-so she hits him with a frying pan. They tussle and he falls down the stairs. Daughter and granddaughter run up stairs, but in a shocking scene that no one saw coming Michael sits straight up and grabs daughter's ankle. Granddaughter grabs knife and chops Michael's hand off and he lets go. Laurie turns on a mechanism that lights hiding place on fire and tells Michael what for and he burns up in fire...but pry not cause I hear they're making a sequel (because of course) so he pry found a way to get out of the basement and escape (eye roll & yawn). Either that or the granddaughter picks up the mantle and is the killer in the next movie somehow possibly due to the trauma (if that's the way they're taking this I'm guessing her target will be men because of how her boyfriend betrayed her and the boyfriend's sidekick tried to hit on her? Don't know and don't care) because the film ends with all of them riding away in the back of a pick up truck and the camera homes in on the granddaughter holding the knife in her hand.By the way I love that the daughter doesn't even ask about or care what happened to her husband. She must have been relieved she didn't have to put up with his annoying mouse-trapping boringness any longer.I'm a big fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and Judy Greer (who I feel is a severely underrated actress) but they were lackluster in this.Do not believe the hype. This was not good. My biggest problem with this film was how Michael just magically found his way to all these people. He's been locked away for 40 years and knows nothing about any of the people he proceeded to kill and yet he was able to go right to where they were at any given time. That's just not realistic.They should have let everyone keep their dignity and preserved the history of this classic. But that just wouldn't be Hollywood now would it?",Halloween
136,cdcrb,no fun or thrills.,1,22 October 2018,"As one who actually saw the first one, yes i'm really old, this is a very sad excuse for a movie. Jamie lee's character has gotten stupid, and acts accordingly. pay your money and takes your chances. if you think that's wise.",Halloween
137,asda-man,The High Noon of horror,9,22 October 2018,"Oh look it's that time of year again! Because nine sequels, one remake and a sequel to that remake wasn't quite enough, Blumhouse have only gone and produced another bleedin' horror featuring the William Shatner mask-wearing madman, Michael Myers. In fact, this sequel makes all the other Halloween movies obsolete by totally ignoring their existence. It's a very wise move considering that Jamie Lee was unwisely bumped off in 2002 so that a cliché-ridden teen slasher film could follow. This sequel could've been equally as terrible, however I'm relieved to say that it's not.I've seen every Halloween film so I consider myself quite a fan and it excites me to say that this is unquestionably the best sequel in the franchise and may even be as good as the original. David Gordon Green has put all the tired slasher tropes in the corner and actually focused on making a good film. It opens fairly bizarrely with a couple of Brits visiting old Michael in his maximum security asylum for their podcast, hoping that he'll have something to say for himself after over forty years of silence. Spoiler alert, he doesn't. Then the title hits the screen and John Carpenter's beautiful score fills the air and you realise that this film really has got back to the basics, in the best possible Scream 4 kind of way.We then get to see the ultimate final girl, Laurie Strode who's looking quite different to how she was imagined in H20. To say that the events in 1978 traumatised her would be an understatement. This Laurie is utterly obsessed with the idea of Michael returning so she's created a little fortress in the middle of nowhere and laden it with traps to capture him once and for all. This has understandably put a strain on the relationship with her daughter, but her granddaughter seems pretty groovy with it. The new characters are all interesting and relevant to the story, however the film doesn't take long to get into the character we really want to see.As if by fate, Michael manages to escape after some bright spark decided it'd be a good idea to transfer him and a load of other loons to another loony bin. Seeing him wondering around the streets and heartlessly butchering random people is thrilling and chilling in equal measure. Out of all the Halloween films, I'd say that Michael definitely gets the most screen time in this one, which is fantastic news. He's also never looked better, Halloween proves to be a masterclass of lighting and camerawork. It's incredibly well-made for a slasher film and David Gordon Green isn't afraid to show some creative flair behind the camera.In the style of High Noon, however, the film is basically one big build up to the showdown between Michael and Laurie. It's very well executed and when the climax does arrive, it's every bit as thrilling and unpredictable as you could hope for. The suspense and intensity levels are very high and less hokey than the fight in H20. In the end, you couldn't have asked for more in a Halloween sequel. You couldn't really have asked for a better face off.Horror fans will also be pleased to know that the body count is very high and pretty violent at times. Of course this doesn't make it a better film, but it makes it far more entertaining to watch. It's also not afraid to make you laugh and I was surprised to find myself laughing amongst moments of dreadful horror. It's also worth noting that Jamie Lee brings her all into the role and it's humbling to see that she hasn't forgotten the character that turned her into the superstar we know her today as. Halloween isn't just the best sequel in the franchise, it also proves itself to be one of the finest slashers to come out in the past two decades.",Halloween
138,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,18 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Like any other Halloween franchise fan, I went into this one with high hopes. After all, Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Laurie Strode - the original Shape/Michael Myers, Nick Castle is also back, and the film had the full support of John Carpenter. It's 40 years after the events of the original film, a direct sequel. This one had to be good, right? Well, not so fast.The opening sequence shows two podcasters arriving to a sanitarium to visit Michael, who's chained up outside in a courtyard. One of them approaches Michael, holding his mask up before him and daring him to speak. ""Say something, Michael,"" he says. When Michael won't respond or even turn around, the podcaster begins to scream at him over and over, ""Say something! Say something!"" Let's just say I was less than thrilled with this beginning, feeling it was rather lame. I was thinking, I hope this isn't going to be an indication of how the rest of this movie is going to go. Fortunately, it did improve - somewhat.While Michael is being transferred to another facility, the bus he is on crashes, allowing him to escape and once more find his way to Haddonfield and to his recluse sister, Laurie. But, Laurie is ready - having had 40 years to prepare for one last showdown. Michael finds the two podcasters, killing them, and retrieves his mask. And then the real carnage begins - on Halloween night.To be honest, I wasn't as enamored with this film as others seem to be. It wasn't a bad movie, in fact, it was pretty entertaining. What I did appreciate about this Halloween movie was that it didn't revert to jump scare tactics, or tricks of the camera. It allowed the tension to build over time, like the original did. The dialogue was fairly good, except for the opening sequence mentioned above. And the cinematography was spot on - with dark backdrops and themes.But, overall, this wasn't an impressive movie to me. It was solid, it was good - and it covered all the bases, so I don't know why I walked away feeling it could've been better. I felt the acting could've been better, honestly. They could have done more with Laurie - bringing more depth to her character. In Halloween H20 - Twenty Years Later, Jamie Lee Curtis brought it. In this one, it seemed like she was holding back some, and I don't know why. The other characters are flawed, but again, the acting was just good enough to get the job done.This wasn't a bad movie. I did enjoy it and would see it again, and would even recommend it. It just falls short a little bit here and there. In the franchise, this is my 3rd favorite - falling behind the original classic, and H20.",Halloween

140,statuskuo,Dumb dumb dumb,1,19 October 2018,"This movie is laughably awful. Like a spoof of the original. You are better off watching...well all of them except H2O, the Rob Zombie ones or 5.
It's 40 years later and Laurie Strode the lone survivor of the babysitter murderer prepares herself for the release of Michael Myers. Where this evil supernatural power comes from isnt ever explain. There is a doctor that has become Michael's caretaker...psychiatrist on hand who is the student of Dr. Loomis. Little is said more about the late great Donald Pleasance.
Laurie has somehow become a nutty survivalist. Nevermind with all the ""Home Alone"" modifications she's done with her home, she is never seen truly learning from survivalist cookbooks. Instead, they paint her out to be a PTSD survivor with a knack for elaborate set ups that Bob Villa would admire. Ridiculously so, I might add.
What really saddens me about this franchise is...we're over it. Theyve mined this cave for all the myths Michael Myers can be because he was never meant to be anything but a tackling dummy. The Terminator does better. And unfortunately, the nods to our history plays more corny than a crowd cheering moment. Much is to be said about strong woman forged from trauma. None of it plays well here. I laughed, rolled my eyes and...well...you've been warned. But you'll go anyway. As is the point of these movies.

Jamie Lee Curtis can still strut her stuff as the 'Scream Queen', but there's not a lot that's new here. Actually there's nothing that's new here. It's just another stalk 'n' slash job. There are, inevitably, some jumpy moments: is that enough? I guess so. My favourite character is the Haddonfield sheriff (Will Patton) who bears a disturbing resemblance to George W. Bush and claims to have been there 40 years ago.Michael is like Dracula: he's unstoppable and has already returned from the grave quite a few times. Presumably there will be a fiftieth anniversary and, eventually, a centenary. There will always be a new generation to scare and some diehard fans who are grandparents themselves, like Jamie Lee and perhaps like you and me.",Halloween

I quite enjoyed watching itDon't get me wrong I have my issues with it, but on the whole it's what you see is what you get. You have Michael Myers who's going around killing people etc etc (we all know the storyline by now). And it's just an easy, enjoyable watch.My issues are: so I feel like a few characters involved were a bit pointless and shoe-horned in. Sheriff with the cowboy hat. Barely in the film and is there for slight comedic effect (I say slight, because it's painfully unfunny). Reporters are another one. The list goes on.
The main characters I also find unlikeable. If one was to die, I don't think anybody would be fussed.But overall I got what I expected, a nice and easy slasher film. Doesn't have jump scares, but if you are a fan of slasher films it's worth putting on.

147,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Does The Job It Was Supposed To Do,9,22 October 2018,"The new HALLOWEEN sets out to make a few things clear. Michael Myers is a human being, not an unstoppable monster that can't be killed. And if you dress up on the night of October 31 as a doctor and/or nurse, like the victims of the first sequel, HALLOWEEN II, absolutely no harm will come. Because all those other incarnations mean nothing. This is the one and only sequel to the John Carpenter classic...And here's a dirty little secret not everyone agrees with. The sparse 1978 blockbuster is extremely far from perfect. But... it was a solid, good horror movie, and was genuinely groundbreaking for a body count slasher flick involving a handful of doomed teenagers, which started off an endless chain of copycats including FRIDAY THE 13TH. So where new director David Gordon Green succeeds is making a simple slasher yarn without too many extravaganzas...What a relief that, give or take a few quick melodramas, the high school students remain pretty much benign and, for the most part, less annoying than in most modern horror films. In fact, they hardly mean anything except to serve up violent (but not overly violent) deaths by the knife-wielding hands of Michael Myers, who escaped from a bus on the way to a permanently-unpleasant psycho-ward residence, and the highway's right next to the same old fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois, where the suburban avenues are still lined with lovely brown, picturesque leaves... but Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode lives safely on the outskirts with a house more protected with villain-proof gadgets than Macaulay Culkin's in HOME ALONE...But that's where things wind up: Before there are two nifty acts that have a kind of beginning, middle and end: The first being introduced to the Strode family and how, because of grandma's paranoid militant attitude, things got screwed-up years earlier. The second lunges into the nighttime-nightmare body count deaths the audience paid for. And then an O.K. Corral face-off Western at Strode Manor, which tends to drag a bit for suspense's sake (reminiscent of the final moments where Jodie Foster aims her gun through the killer's dark house in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, only much longer)...And right before, a twist centered on Myers' psychiatrist (Laurie actually addresses him as ""the new Loomis"" referring to Donald Pleasence's Dr. Loomis) is a tad random, farfetched and downright bizarre, but it happens so that the conclusion technically makes sense. Which can sum up this entire two-hour experience: None of it would exist without decades of previous installments; after all, those maligned sequels and remakes helped make the original be that much more timeless and godlike, and, thankfully, HALLOWEEN 2018 mirrors its most important asset: In not trying too hard to be great, it's good enough to stand completely by itself.",Halloween

150,baileycrawly,Tired,5,13 May 2020,"Laurie Strode, now a grandmother, is ready for the Halloween night, 40 years after the first attack, when Michael Myers will return home to kill. That night is tonight...There comes a time in every slasher series where you go from inspired horror movie to generic, half-assed piece of work designed exclusively to earn the studio's money.Halloween crossed into that category in the fourth entry and continued its downward spiral, managing to successfully revive itself with both Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later and the Rob Zombie remake. Now, bringing back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode in the second retconned sequel, we're back with some more fan service.Because, ultimately, this has little appeal to anyone else. The story is the same as its always been; Michael Myers came back home to Haddonfield in search of members of his bloodline to kill, committing murder after murder in his pursuit of those people. The family is larger, but the schtick is still - painfully - the same.Every minute of watching this movie is like watching the characters do things you've already seen before. Even the acting brilliance of Jamie Lee Curtis couldn't save this sinking ship. Ultimately, what you're left with - and what this film results in - is yet another tired attempt from Miramax to milk as much money out of the franchise as they possibly can, a trend which is evidenced further by the intentions to release at least two more sequels, both of which will undoubtedly continue to carry out the tired Strode storyline. Unfortunately for this franchise, that storyline - despite being the strongest thing it has going for itself - has been exhausted. It's time to either move on or give up on the franchise.The bright side of this is that Halloween Kills is left with virtually no other direction to go but up. One can hope.",Halloween
151,sweidman-28016,Entertaining Nostalgia,6,29 October 2018,"Halloween (2018) Review:Halloween is the reboot of the famous 1978 of the same name. I was intrigued to see this only because last years horror movie remake, IT, did well. I enjoyed this movie but not as much as I thought I would. It was a good concept but not really original. It only regarded the first two movies of the franchise and disregarded the others. It centers around Laurie Strode, Jamie Lee Curtis, and her family as Michael Meyers escapes prison and comes after her on Halloween night 40 years later. Jamie Lee Curtis was really good in this movie. Judy Greer as Karen was fine, I'm not a big fan of her but she's fine. Those were probably the only standouts for me. The plot would've been better if there weren't so many unnecessary side plots. There's a short side plot with two podcasters that was so unnecessary. If you really think about it the only served one key plot point in the whole thing. There's also a small part concerning Michael's psychiatrist and that was one of the dumbest parts. Karen's daughter, Allyson, played by Andi Matichak, was fine. She's in high school so there's some high school stuff that's unnecessary too. The ending was a little disappointing to me. There's also an after credit scene and you could already tell before the movie what they're going to do. The scares were fine, though this movie really wasn't scary at all. They tried doing more jump scares which I thought was dumb because the format of a jump scare goes like this: you can tell it's coming, you jump, you laugh at yourself for jumping kind of. Could've been more real scares than cheap ones. One thing I really liked was that they recreated scenes from the original but some were just opposite or with different people. They score was like the original and John Carpenter, the original director, composer, and writer of the first film, did the score and I liked it. The film really captured nostalgia at certain parts. The cinematography was good. Overall this was an entertaining movie with a great performance by Jamie Lee Curtis. It could've been better however. I think most people would like this movie though. It's another movie to watch around Halloween.My Grade: B-",Halloween

153,dfle3,An interesting spin on the franchise. 72.5+%,7,3 November 2018,"Even though this film is a sequel to the film of the same name (!) which was released in 1978, it doesn't really demand that the viewer revisit all the previous films in this franchise in order to be able to follow the story. In fact, enough backstory is given (via dialogue, flashbacks/footage from the original) to allow the newcomer to this franchise to know enough in order to be sufficiently well informed. That 1978 film is a classic of the ""slasher"" genre and was once the highest grossing independent film of all time.For those not familiar with this franchise, the (continuing) story revolves around a serial killer (Michael Myers) who discovered his taste for murder as a six-year-old on Halloween and has a nasty habit of returning that night as an adult in order to commit mass murder. A continuing character has been Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis), who appeared in the 1978 film as a high school student-cum-babysitter and (mild spoiler) returns in the same role for this sequel.An aspect that I liked about this latest instalment is how it begins with a visit to the hospital where Michael Myers is being held for his crimes. It doesn't seem typical to me, and perhaps marks the film out as not being an inferior sequel. There were some quibbles for me during this part of the film, such as whether it's plausible that a doctor at the facility would allow podcasters to behave that way towards Michael Myers, but I suppose that it is justified later on in the film. The podcasters did have a touch of the penny dreadfuls about them, as far as the nature of their podcasts went, but they were also presented as having achieved important things with their work, so that seemed a bit incongruous to me. Their discussion about the dynamic between Michael Myers and Laurie Strode didn't sit well with me, in any case.In another sign that this isn't some cheap and nasty exploitation of the franchise (apart from its MA15 rating) is that it takes its time in order to get to the part that fans of the slasher genre no doubt want to get to...murders. Lots of murders. Even though I've seen only 4 films in this franchise, I think, those being the first 3 titles and the ""H20"" anniversary film, I would hazard a guess that this 2018 film has the highest body count of any of them. Not all the killings are shown. You see the aftermath of some killings. Some murders are implied. With an MA15 rating, the murders don't get too horrific.On the subject of murders, I did ponder about the nature of Michael Myers' killing spree, as far as what its logic was. Later on in the film, one of the characters, Dr. Ranbir Sartain (played by Haluk Bilginer) does ask the same sort of question. Also of interest to me was where Michael Myers himself drew the line at who he killed, which is an idea that the film itself toys with. Lines do seem to be drawn. I noticed one definite line that he didn't cross but then remembered earlier in the film, where it's arguable that he did cross that line...but then I remembered something which might possibly justify Myers crossing that line (the scene with the bus).The most striking feature of this film which marks it out as superior to mere exploitation of the franchise (albeit one which had its origins in an exploitation genre) is the fact that it is often funny. There were a few moments where I actually laughed out loud. There were also likeable characters, who made me laugh. For instance the pleasing dynamic between a beautiful babysitter and a young African-American boy. Such superior characterisation wasn't limited to these two characters though. Kudos to the people behind this film to treat characters as more than just fodder for a serial killer whom we want to see meet their ultimate doom in as short a time as possible.Another novelty to this instalment of the franchise is how it focuses on the effects of the events of 1978 on Laurie Strode. You don't normally see such exploration of the aftermath in these kinds of films and their sequels...granted, most characters don't survive more than one sequel, but, still...Overall, whilst I wouldn't say that I found the film scary, I did find it interesting, which is more than you can say for a lot of films. Things did get tense at times though. However, I didn't find myself getting totally immersed in the world...I had distance to the proceedings. For instance, I pondered on how Michael Myers made his way to his home town. Hitchhiking? Driving? People didn't avoid picking him up if he was hitchhiking? Since he was institutionalised as a boy, how did he learn to drive? If he hid in people's cars, isn't it too coincidental that he made it back to his home town? Admittedly, much of this conjecture was wry, on my part.Followers of this franchise might pick up callbacks to previous films. I picked up one which flipped the subject/object of the 1978 film (or at least adds a twist to it), I think (when one character looks back down on the ground from a first-storey window). I missed one concerning masks which appeared in the film ""Halloween III"" (which is unrelated to the main characters in this film). It was only by reading the closing credits that I was alerted to this.As I say, I haven't seen all the films in this franchise, so I'm not sure how contradictory or implausible things get in this latest instalment. I do not know if there have been spin-offs in the franchise, like ""Michael Myers vs Freddy Krueger (or vs Jason Voorhees or vs Pinhead or vs Predator or vs Alien)"". However, glancing at Wikipedia on this franchise for my review here, I do see that the 2018 version ignores the sequels to the 1978 film. That may be a good thing, although I do remember really liking ""Halloween II"". Wikipedia also does note that ""H20"" ignores the 4th through to 6th films in this franchise. I'm not sure then, if the 2018 instalment ignores those same films too. Perhaps it's in those films where a new mythology is added, which both ""H20"" and this latest instalment ignores.Lastly, if you're wondering about sequels to this latest instalment, I could see a couple of directions that the franchise could go (no doubt not as good as this one, due to wanting to cash in on its success). One direction involves a visual cue in the back of the ute and another one concerns what is, perhaps, an audio cue during the closing credits, which might be more of a longbow to draw.Random observations:* This instalment spends quite a bit of time around Michael Myers, seeing what he is doing (not from his perspective though). That seems new to this franchise, to me at least.* When you do glimpse Michael Myers near the start of the film, he does seem too old for his supposed actual age. I'm not sure why that would be.* What is the nature of the mask that Michael Myers wears? Did he wear it as a six-year-old child? I don't remember the first film well enough to recall. Perhaps the issue is with Halloween masks in general?* One character, a sheriff's deputy, says that he was involved in the night that Michael Myers originally came home, in 1978. Can't say if I remember him (i.e. The actor or the character) being in the original film, but that wouldn't be surprising if I couldn't, in any case.",Halloween

This movie works into the original storyline, and in future years, I will watch it after watching Halloween I & II. This movie is really scary, and, if seen as a stand-alone film, is quite believable (a rarity in the horror genre).

It's fun, shout out loud satisfying slasher horror, surprisingly gory but not overly gory, a romp, both true to the original character and expanding and supporting a more modern Jamie Lee Curtis and japes with her family.
There's a janky opening, but like the rest of the movie, it may have been a great bait and switch with the horror slasher tropes, as soon as the old font and music kicks in you know what you're in for; Something old, something new, some things borrowed, someone choked blue.
I cheered every time they homaged the original because it was always testeful, and well edited in, its shot and written breaking the fourth wall, but the characters don't at all.
The whole ""say something"" conceit didn't really track for me, but Halloween 2017 is a well intentioned, layered and balanced horror film, dealing with real world issues woven between the slow moving freight train inevitability of Michael Myers.",Halloween

Having loved and worshipped the original Halloween then rewatching it 40 years later with an avid following of fans at the cinema I realised the many faults the film has. The excellent concept, filming and music are let down by goofy moments and outdated pacing. It's still iconic but flawed. The new Halloween is nothing but flawed. I feel like I'm watching a really dated film that is trying to be ironic but comes across sarcastic and tiresome. The scares are lacking, the characters unconvincing, the development dull and so on. I could not be more disappointed. Halloween: H20 (1998) was better, at least it got the Halloween vibe and was entertaining. The only decent recent remake was It (2017), that was phenomenal and I didn't get my phone out once watching that. The music and filming are the only positives of the new Halloween.

For example, Curtis tells her daughter Michael is out. The conversation just cuts, like no big deal. After he is out, he is on a killing spree and NO ONE seems to know, nor the news media. Really?It's just one scene after the other assuming the audience is too dumb or don't care about the obvious blunders. Maybe they are too dumb or maybe they just don't care. I find it irritating that with a few little writing fixes you can still have a great coherent logical horror film.Did every scene have to be comprised of ""someone scared or yelling in fear and their friend not believing them, until we know what happens.""So all the things you would NOT do, they ALL do.You know when you see 40 police cars for a robbery in real life, but here they have an old sheriff by himself tend to the out of control killer without calling for backup.Then the ridiculous cast. The ""Wiz guy"" from Seinfeld?

Jamie Lee looks great with her crazy hair and tough as nails attitude! I also really liked the little kid that was being babysat! Super funny!
As for the movie itself, it was just ok. They made Jamie Lee's character just way too crazy. Annoyingly so. And the ending was very anticlimactic, and sort of a yawn after all of the build up.

The murderer is basically a zombie that goes around randomly killing people. Apparently nothing can stop him, not the bus accident he was involved in, not being run over by a police car, not being shot in the back, not losing a hand, just a ridiculous trap made by an insane old woman.

165,TwistedContent,Just Satisfying Enough,7,29 October 2018,"Out of all the classic horror franchises (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Hellraiser etc.) Halloween has been one of my favorites, but not necessarily the best, it's just that The Shape fu*kin' rocks. I had been waiting for this sequel for a long time & I knew that it's not gonna be spectacular or perfect or even really good, I don't think it's possbile anymore, so I was already settled with an above-average expierence before this one came out. And above-average expierence it is. For the fans of the franchise this can't go wrong - it has enough to offer, a bad-ass Laurie Strode, The shape doing some nice kills and not delivering huge amounts of cheese, cinematic references to the 1st part & even a worthy Loomis ""replacement"" (who did some questionable stuff though - but blame the writers). For the average viewer ""Halloween"" has still some things to offer - nice looking cinematography, a few nice kills (and some underwhelming) & decent acting throughout. However, there were also enough flaws that will be taken into account by all audiences. For me the biggest flaw was the 3rd act - it dragged, dragged too much, so the culmination wasn't all that epic. The 2nd biggest flaw was... gore. I was expecting more & still think there should've been more. Don't be scared, it does have more meat than the 1st part, but, well, way less meat than Rob Zombie's remake of ""Halloween"" had. The rest of the flaws depends on the viewer, because it's the script & I cannot speak for all in this matter. I'm satisfied and came out of the theater filled with the vibe I was looking for. This is a solid 7/10.",Halloween

The movie also pretty much abandons the story lines from all the sequels, not really even acknowledging the events of the original second film, which I guess just depends on your liking of the sequels, I like them so I find it kinda annoying, but, I see were the going with it.

Pretty much rips off the other Halloween movies!! Babysitting, check. Michael escaped, check. Micheal escapes during transport, check. The other movies give Michael a reason to do what he does. He stalks haddenfield & it's residents. He doesn't kill everyone he sees, like in Halloween 2 where he walks in the house & gets the knife, he doesn't kill the woman fixing her husband a sandwich. In this one, he gets a hammer & goes in the house to kill the woman & then takes the knife!! The other movies, he didn't just go house to house killing, but he does in this one!! Dr. Loomis was obsessed with Michael but the one replacing him went overboard, killed the sheriff & put the mask on!! The writing is also crap & the director should have been canned!!

169,skybrick736,Halloween (2018),8,31 October 2018,"As a Halloween fanatic, its bitter-sweet to have a sequel that doesn't follow the original franchise. However, it's easier to come to terms that this is a strikingly new era for horror movies and that the last movie in the series was the poorly executed Halloween: Resurrection came out in 2002. The ability to sign on Jamie Lee Curtis was the pivotal move that would make the new film reputable and have the ability to continue a new story and future films. The major plus was the collaboration with John Carpenter to help pitch in with the film's score and soundtrack. The music was absolutely amazing from start to finish and mixed in with the scenes perfectly, especially when Michael meets the new heroine Allison at the gate for the first time.
What also stuck out with David Gordon Green's adaptation of Halloween II is the amount of homage he plays back for the entire franchise with certain scenes, dialogue and props. It was quite remarkable and borderline ridiculous how many call backs, it seemed like it was almost every other scene. Similarly, to most of the Halloween films there is a clear separation between the first half of movie and the second half. The first half of the film was kind of choppy in places but it did provide with a great intro and some decent supporting role characters to move the story in the right place. The second half is exquisite excellency all the way around that includes, script, acting, dialogue and the full force of Michael Myers's brutality. Any fan of the franchise will likely enjoy this film, although it does bring up some saddening nostalgia about how great Carpenter's original Halloween films are.",Halloween

171,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"An uninspired travesty, plain and simple",3,29 October 2018,"It sucks.It's actually, without a doubt, the worst movie I have seen in 2018. Everyone that I went with agreed: it sits in the 3-4 out of 10 range, and should not have been made. The only thing I can compare it to is the worst, most formulaic, most forgettable horror movies of the 80's...the ones that are completely throwaway.Pros: Jamie Lee Curtis brings life to her character.Cons: Literally everything else.Though the trailer was a MASSIVE red flag, I wanted to give the movie a chance considering I am generally a fan of director David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, Your Highness) and Danny McBride. I figured coming from a successful comedy team, these guys would infuse some electric personality into the series, however that is the furthest thing from what actually happened. It's not often that I actually feel kind of upset about giving a film my box office points, but this one did it. I feel ripped off. It's a fully vapid money grab. Thank the heavens Green did not stay attached to the Suspiria remake, because he was originally set to direct it.The film is a travesty. A complete lack of atmosphere. A complete lack of style. A complete lack of inspiration. The cast was absurdly bland, as were the characters, some actually painful to observe. The story is the furthest thing from engaging I have witnessed this year, and offers nearly nothing outside of the most surface level plot we already know of Halloween, which is already as minimal as it gets to begin with. Even the majority of the violence is uninteresting or not shown at all.Another selling point for me going into it was the fact that John Carpenter did the music, but John Carpenter's music was so bland and cliche it was barely noticeable. There was approximately ONE cue on the score that stood out (""The Shape Hunts Allyson"" and it's 58 seconds long). Even the most effective cue (""The Shape Lurks"") from the original score (outside of the theme song) was watered down with production and tainted. I hope that Grandpa Johnny at least got paid well of all people!I am actually starting to wonder if we will ever come out of this ""era of remakes"" or if this is actually the death of film.",Halloween

Pretending that nothing in the dozen or so follow-on films actually happened after all (and probably for the best,"" 2018's 'Halloween' is really different because it feels raw.The psychological impact the events of the original had on Jamie Lee Curtis's Strode is so apparent in this film that it's hard not to feel a certain attachment to her. But of course, for those who did not live through that horrible halloween back in 1978, it's hard for them to understand the weight and the pain. Curtis does a masterful job in bringing the vengeful, damaged Strode to life - now as a mother and grandmother - in a way that positions her, not Myers, as the star of the show.Overall, 'Halloween' is an ode to good ol' fashioned self-defense, in addition to the importance of protecting family above all. The body count in this film is high, and much more gruesome than previous entries in this franchise, but it's not as gratuitous as many other films in this genre. While there's plenty of knives, blood and gore, 'Halloween' at its heart is a psychological thriller that explores how human confront pure evil.It's not a classic, but 'Halloween' is a well-done social commentary that should stand high above other similar films.",Halloween

The versatile director David Gordon in thinking about his film decided not to take into account all previous Hallowens, except for the first of 1978 - best of all - his screenplay is a direct continuation of the first feature, turning 40 years later, where Michael Myers escapes from the rehab center and returns to hunt Laurie Stronde, the survivor of the first film's slaughter. It's a shame the film's impact is completely nil because we are no longer living the Golden Age of Slasher Movies, a story so ingrained in pop culture in the end to end up without much expression, but David deserves our recognition for catching a dead genre and giving some air of novelty and nostalgia in him, as I said, Hallowen has several problems, of continuation, problems of cuts and even problems of acting and photography. The film sometimes does not know which way to go, sometimes the length is brutal, sometimes it is not, sometimes the gore is exaggerated other times it is not present, but not every technical and artistic part is bad, as we have the classic trail chilling and nostalgic sound in the movie that is well used and also the actress Jamie Lee commands well as ""Laurie"".

175,jamiedarlow-37510,The Shape returns....,5,15 February 2020,"It's with a heavy heart that I say; I really wanted to like this one more than I actually did. The thing is, it's an impressive film! It's clearly made with absolute passion and a love of the original, the cinematography is beautiful with some amazing panning shots and close ups, the gory moments are fun, John Carpenter returns along with his son Cody and Daniel A. Davies to recreate and provide a thrilling soundtrack, Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic (Laurie Strode's plot is well written and wonderfully acted) and there are certain sequences including Michael Myers returning to town and wandering through peoples houses that are just expertly crafted. Despite all this to respect and how exciting the opening is, I found myself a bit bored as the film went on. What's more frustrating is i was wondering why that was during the film; I think ultimately I didn't find it particularly scary, the jump scares felt a bit predictable, there are some really misplaced humourous scenes that just detract a bit from the spooky vibes (apart from young Jibrail Nantambu who is pretty great in his cameo appearance) and there is a twist around three quarters of the way in which was just kinda silly and didn't need to be there. The Boogeyman presence from Myers is a fascinating part of the story and whenever 'The Shape' is on screen, it is interesting seeing what he's going to do next on his relentless killing spree. I may be becoming a bit desensitised as I'm sure this is going to work for a lot of people and I recommend seeing it if you're a horror fan as there are moments that are genuinely cool! Just not enough to make it massively memorable as a whole in my opinion but you may love it!

178,jayjaycee,Extremely enjoyable but nevertheless dumb and unnecessary homage,6,8 November 2020,"""Halloween"" is a 2018 horror film directed by David Gordon Green starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Judy Greer.
⚪
All in all, this direct follow-up to John Carpenter's cult classic slasher slays by eliminating all other sequels that were produced in the past decades, and instead focussing on the legacy of the franchise, and thanks to a straightforward direction, a passable atmosphere and sufficiently creative writing and much fan service, it becomes an honourable but not outstanding homage and continuation to the night he came home, that despite major plot convenience, plot holes and an unbalanced story development, manages to create an acceptably moody genre treat that will please many but definitely not all fans of the franchise.
⚪
By now, it has been already two years since I have watched this film in cinema with friends, and I remember leaving the cinema extremely pleased. Since then, my taste for films has evolved tremendously, and I was concerned whether I was going to still like it the same way I did back in the day. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it a lot, even if I noticed some major flaws I was probably too excited and naïve to perceive the last time. First of all, I think the reason why this film works out so well and sparks this feeling of childlike joy in me, is that it is a film from fans for fans, as it oozes fan service and parallels that will make every admirer smile. As marvellous as this sounds, copying and slightly altering the most iconic scenes of a legendary film isn't everything and shouldn't be what a film relies on, especially when you are a slasher in the twenty-first century. Even if consider myself a fan of slasher movies and find a liking to them, remastering the ultimate classic from the seventies is probably one of the worst ideas you can have, cause, lets face it, this subgenre has completely gone out of style and become extremely irrelevant for this genre. The last time they were in was when Wes Craven somehow revived it in the middle of the nineties with ""Scream"", but since then it has become dull for the modern horror fans, especially teenagers. For most of the modern generation, a horror film consist of extreme violence, blood and gore, and a guy slaughtering babysitters with a knife while wearing a mask has become cringeworthy. That's why I think that this film was a bold move and required a lot of audacity, for it dared to undo all the beloved sequels and take up an extremely old-fashioned formula, and considering that the dude who made the stoner comedy ""Pineapple Express"" was assigned to helm this project, it was even more risky. What am I to say? Against all odds, this film somehow managed to become fairly pleasing, nevertheless. Like with many things in life, time is a crucial factor for why this film works out. Exactly forty years after the tragic night in the suburbs of a small-town in Illinois, the fiend with the devil's eyes returns to his hometown to go on a killing spree once again. His biggest opponent, Laurie Strode, the only babysitter from the original who managed to survive, is back as well, went full Sarah Connor and suffers from severe PTSD. Her estranged daughter and granddaughter are of the party as well, and it is about three generations of Strode women facing off against the pure evil. The thing is, even if it is a great idea for a sequel, the execution lacks what the original had built up so magnificently. It relies on nostalgia way too much and almost forgets about including fresh ideas completely. Minders are brutally murdered by Michael Myers and the police are once again overchallenged to catch him - where is the innovation? There might be absolutely gory and blood sequences of violence that were only possible to translate into action with modern standards, but what else? It has a decent atmosphere, but it simply because the soundtrack is all too familiar. Furthermore, the plot itself is way too simple as well. Like, after forty years of being at Smith's Grove, Michael Myers is transferred to another institution and coincidentally escapes from the bus. That leads me to another issue this film suffers from: plot convenience and plot holes. Too many things are utterly predictable, and most things are either stupid or make no sense at all. Why does The Shape kill a boy, but spares all the children on the street or the helpless baby in the cradle, if he is the pure and unadulterated evil? Why is the Dad of Allyson so painfully cringeworthy? Why is the police still so incredibly incompetent? Well, all of that is somewhat tolerable and to this point the film is a mindless but enjoyable experience, however, what somewhat taints this is the dumb final act. I mean, the essence of the original film is the fight of unarmed and helpless young adults against the personification of pure evil, so why are there so many weapons in the end? The thing is, that Laurie owns a huge arsenal is understandable and makes a lot of sense, but why don't they use it? If that was indeed a real fight, Michael would have died in the front yard, because after all, he is still human. I know, six bullets couldn't stop him in the original, but Laurie has blood shotguns and even worse guns in her wardrobe. In no way this would have been an even battle in real life, like, he is only armed with a kitchen knife, and they were four people, armed to the teeth, with two policemen waiting outside. You know what I mean? In this final act, it loses its steam completely and turns into a mediocre and dumb shootout. The peak of it all is when they lock him up in the cellar, set the house on fire and freaking leave. I mean, come on?! They were at close range, three women with shotguns, they could have mutilated him easily without giving him the chance to harm them. In the end, though, it deserves my respect for what it wanted to achieve. Most of the time, it is incredibly enjoyable and brings back a lot of nostalgic feelings, but honestly, there are so many dumb flaws that keep the film from being great. If you are able to turn of your mind and embrace it as mindless fun and a tribute to a classic slasher, you are in for a ride. Just don't think too much. Effective and amusing take on an old-fashioned cultural phenomenon that knows to entertain, even if it is, as a matter of fact, unnecessary and uncalled for. Knowing that two sequels are about to be released makes me feel uncomfortable.",Halloween
179,DuskShadow,THE SHAPE of Halloween Horror Returns,6,19 October 2018,"I have been waiting for this a long long time.
Say what one will about the latter movies from part 3-6 that explained the whole franchise as a somewhat occultish, supernatural experience, but this latest iteration goes back to the pure roots without all the nonsense.
The horror of William Shatner's face returns in what is meant to be the official sequel to the original 1978 iconic slasher. This movie is meant to retcon ALL movies after the very first; that means no rob zombie films count, no crummy 4-6 movies count, even as some alternate timeline nonsense,plus the utter trash that was the third halloween movie is more than relegated to the garbage pile as well, but the beloved second film that had picked up after the very first is also, sadly, no longer canonical.
Though that fact makes me a tad sad, I am glad I saw this film finally, a full day before release.It was nice to have most of a theatre to myself, even with about a dozen other people scattered around many seats, because it allows esier immersion into the intended dread atmosphere that is the genres bread and butter. Hell even hearing a large guyscream likea girl reminded me of the power of film upon the mind and our lives. Heh...he made me laugh.
Though many tropes such as people tripping and falling, being caught and gutted so easily left many with chuckles and heads being shaken, there were some simply dumb things that could not be missed, even by a newbie to the series of slasher films. If I got into them, it would spoilt the film utterly..moving on.
The movie acted as closure to the series overall, and seeing Jamie Lee Curtis reprise her role as the ever victimized sister of Meyers took me back to the early days of modern horror films. Yet ironically all the current era nonsense such as touch phones, endless urban legends, media and what not, did not help elevate the intelligence of characters within the film, making many easy targets for not just my criticism, but our iconic antagonist returned to the screen as well. At times I laughed at the stupidity throughout much of the film, more than the actual short comedic jokes in some scenes would have intended, other times I was angry with the overly played out tropes. But the irony is that these things make up the genre: the easily caught victims, the teen sacrifices to the killer like the metaphors used in Cabin in the Woods as being necessary to placate audiences and dark gods alike...These tropes exist for a good reason. MORE BLOOD! :p
Now though I paused to consider how often I hated something in the film, whether it was something too predictable or just plain poorly done, I have seen quite a lot of movies and things in my time, making me a tad jaded.
Still I am glad, and entering in a score for this film marks four thousand four hundred and forty four (4,444th) intellectual properties I have kept track of after on IMDB! Thus this film is monumentous in more than one way for me , garnering a 6.5/10 and I shant forget it any time soon.

I had thought, from what I'd heard, that this was going to be one last movie to end the series for good. I think the inclusion of Judy Greer into this movie was a huge red flag. Hollywood has kept trying to push her for years. Throughout the movie, you got this vibe that they were trying to hand off this series to her for more sequels. The end pretty much confirmed that. I was very disappointed. I won't spoil anything, but after all the build-up, the ending was totally underwhelming.It's a shame because it was such a good film until then. It's just as cheesy as the other sequels before it. Just ridiculous.Wait until Redbox, to be honest.",Halloween

183,msunando,It's revenge on their minds,7,19 September 2021,"Michael Myers is finally out from the confinement, and how. He must keep moving, and killing, it's simple and it's gruesome. He doesn't discriminate, wait or give an opportunity to his victims. He doesn't talk and doesn't even feel anything, not even pain, remember he was clinically dead a long time ago. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has also been waiting for this day, she needs to avenge her experience of Michael from her youth, and protect her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) from his menace. She has converted her home into a fortress and has arsenal ready to counter him. It's showtime, folks, and it's the Halloween night!Halloween resumes from where it left earlier and goes straight for the jugular. No wasting precious time or sparing the chills - Michael is on a killing spree and Laurie is his prize. This movie is crisp, short and to the point, and director David Goron Green sticks to the business of unadulterated horror. Jamie Lee Curtis is amazingly fit and in total control of the proceedings, and James Jude Courtney is downright menacing.",Halloween

185,flicklover,Best Halloween movie since the 1978 classic!!!,8,1 November 2020,"John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween is the best horror movies ever made. The best slasher film ever made. It set a great standard but dozens of imitators and many sequels that were nowhere near close to the quality of the first one. The last last couple of sequels were almost unwatchable. In 1998 Jamie Lee Curtis was brought back for Halloween H20 which was ok but has not aged well.When I saw the trailer for this new one it looked good and the hype surrounding it was positive. The selling point was that it was a direct sequel to the 1978 original. With just that being the case increased my interest because the franchise had gone so far of the rails that a return to the original film and ignoring the sequels was welcome to most.This new film takes place 40 years after the original film's events. Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Laurie Strode. Laurie had been permently scarred by being almost murdered by Michael Myers when she was in high school. She became obsessed with learning how to defend herself and her daughter from what she fears as the inevitable return of Michael. Think Laurie Strode as Sarah Connor. Laurie is estranged from her daughter Karen played by Judy Greer. Jamie Lee Curtis is very good here at expressing Laurie's trauma which has dominated her life. Her daughter really doesn't want to deal with what she thinks are her mother's crazy fantasies. She has resentment towards her mother for ruining her childhood with her obsession with Michael Myers.Michael us in a state mental facility and visited by a couple of podcasters that are investigating his murders. His new psychiatrist is Dr. Sartain played by Haluk Bilginer. Through some events Michael escapes the custody of the state and starts a killing spree on his way back Haddonfield on the October 31st.Director David Gordon Green does a good job in paying homage to John Carpenter's style but goes in a couple different directions. Some work well and some really don't. There are a couple of characters and situation that don't add a thing to the film that could have been left on the cutting room floor. I wish they would have fleshed out Laurie and Karen's relationship. As far as the horror elements, they work well by and large. I wouldn't say the film is extremely gory but the kills are more brutal than on the original.It is a very good sequel that revives a dead franchise.Solid film.Grade: B.",Halloween
186,gustheaffen,An immensely disappointing and weak 40 year sequel,3,21 October 2018,"Save your money and either do like we did and see it at an early cheap matinee or wait for video. Very weak script, the story almost seem to be so piecemeal and nonsensical it had no flow or build up. The Halloween music was seldom used which was a staple of the original. Somehow Michael found the reporters and granddaughters friends babysitting, they had characters that just disappeared (the boy being babysat and the granddaughter's boy friend), and though it was well cast many characters were just totally wasted (Toby Huss was the worst example).I'm a huge fan of the franchise horror movies from the late 70s and 80s. This just was not at all a good tribute or way to follow-up. Overall this was just boring and sterile.",Halloween
187,Rendanlovell,Good when it isn't annoying,6,21 August 2020,"Rewatch #3
Ok, so I forgot how annoying these characters are. I still liked Jamie Lee Curtis but, dam, everyone else is SO obnoxious. That stupid fat kid, the over the top father, and especially ""the new loomis"". He's the worst.Everything about him is either rehashed or plain bad. The scene when he puts on the mask is specifically terrible. In fact, I hated that plot device so much it ruined a fair portion of this. He is exclusively used as a plot device and boy is it bad.Again, Jamie is good though. I liked her dynamic with her family. I liked her performance. She's almost the villain of the film, even replicating some iconic Michael moments. Everyone aside from her and her family are mainly tools for michael to play with. There's Podcasters that accomplish nothing, a kid and his dad, and a variety of teens that exist in one scene so they can die.That said, this is quite gruesome. Michael is once again pure evil. Slaughtering everyone in his path. There's that great one take shot following him around killing people. It's fully open to showing excessive violence and that was great. Love when an R rated horror movie really goes for it like this.I also loved the atmosphere of it. When it isn't annoying it feels close to the original in tone. Slow and methodical, building a creeping tone that I liked. Sure it retreads virtually the same story a number of the others do but after Resurrection and the Rob Zombie movies I'm fine with it going back to basics. It's like watching a more expensive and gory Halloween 4. Plus the music rules.",Halloween

190,ExpendableMan,"""An evil like his never stops. It just grows older. Darker. More determined.""",6,4 November 2021,"From glancing around Letterboxd and IMDB, Halloween 2018 seems to be largely admired by horror fans. A direct sequel to the iconic original that ignores everything that came after it (yes, including Halloween 2), it's been described as a true sequel and a return to form for the series.However, I wasn't completely convinced. There's a lot to admire here, especially Jamie Lee Curtis' portrayal of the older Laurie Strode as a shotgun totting, Sarah Connor-esque badass, but this didn't capture the spirit of the original as much as I'd have liked.Go back and watch the original Halloween and it's striking how slow paced it is. The body count is comparatively low and it works more on a gradual build up of tension, Michael Myers' frighteningly still presence lurking in shadows for a considerable amount of time before he takes the knife to his victims. Here though, he's an indestructible, rampaging monster who ratchets up a ludicrous kill tally before the film even reaches the halfway point. The death scenes are violent and gruesome and Michael is genuinely scary again, but there's too many. There's even two deaths in the middle that are completely unnecessary, he just walks into two random houses, murders the unnamed occupants and disappears again. There's no immediate reason for this scene to take place and you're left wondering who it was he's just butchered?On the plus side, this film does play with the horror trope of jackasses getting what's coming to them. Most of the victims are likeable youngsters and you don't really want any of them to get killed. There's a couple of brief flashes of humour too (two cops bickering over a sandwich, a lovelorn teen accidentally pouring his heart out to a serial killer) which occur naturally and don't disrupt the dark atmosphere. And again, Curtis is terrific, she grabs the bull by the horns and goes all out.But, much as they want to ignore everything but the original, this has more in common with Halloween 4, 5 and 6 than it wants you to think. It's fun and it's scary, but it works best when it's just Laurie Strode, her daughter and Granddaughter fighting The Shape. The rest is a bloodbath and if you go in expecting a tense, slow-paced thriller in line with the original, you'll be disappointed.",Halloween
191,WalkdenEntertainment,Halloween Delivers Familiar Thrills...,8,15 November 2018,"It's been 40 years since Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) was attacked by the masked killer Michael Myers. After narrowly surviving that horrible night, Laurie now comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers. Over the last forty years Laurie has been preparing for the return of Michael. Naturally Michael escapes jail and the killing spree begins. Oh and once again, Michael has escaped on the night of Halloween...🎃For those who are not aware, this film is best to be treated as a sequel to the 1st Halloween film which featured in 1978. Thankfully, this new film ignores all the different sequels and remakes that have come to our way in cinemas over the last forty years. If you haven't seen the original you can still jump straight into this film, but to truly benefit from this film and gain the most from it, I do recommend freshening up with the original 1978 film 1st.My favourite element to this film is seeing Laurie (Jame Lee Curtis). Laurie is a character who is now older and has a family to protect (both a daughter and a granddaughter). To top it off, Laurie has been preparing for the return of Michael. Her home is now a fortress and she is loaded with weaponry (guns, traps, knives etc). She still shows fear, but she wants to finish the battle with Michael once and for all and be free from worrying about when Michael will come for her. Laurie as a character brings much strength to the big screen- so much so that whenever we don't see her I was somewhat saddened.Another big plus to this film is the look and sound of this film. Hearing John Carpenter's original soundtrack brought back to life was a pure joy to hear. The film also sneaks in many nods to the original Halloween series, in particularly the 1st film. Halloween 2018 does something similar to what Star Wars: The Force Awakens did by going back to the original roots and giving fans what they wanted and enjoy the most.While Laurie takes the lead along with Michael doing his thing, we are given many characters (mostly teenagers) with little back story or interest as to who they are. I feel many viewers will find very little interest in or compassion for the range of teenagers running around, getting drunk and trying to survive the night of Halloween. For a slasher film I don't feel we are ever expected to gain great knowledge of all the characters. If the leads (Laurie and Michael) are built well in this film then I'm happy... and thankfully in this film they are.The film also introduces a few minor twists which I honestly struggled to enjoy. Thankfully the twists moved on rather quickly and the story gets back on track with the film in hand. I was also surprised to see some minor humour/jokes sneaking into this new Halloween film. The jokes did surprisingly land some giggles for me. Even if some viewers may find the humour out of place, I enjoyed it.My biggest disappointment other than a couple of poor plots twists was two key characters and the actors used in this film. Without spoiling the plot, there are two characters here who if I had it my way would have possibly been recast or had their character profile altered. I found it hard to accept these two characters and it does effect some keys moments in the film. But again, the 2 main characters are done perfectly and this complaint about these two actors is some what a minor issue.Overall, this is a fantastic slasher film for those who love this type of horror genre. I personally loved seeing Jame Lee Curtis on screen once again, with her nailing her performance as Laurie. This film is a worthy sequel and provides many nods to the original Halloween film series which many have loved and enjoyed for many year. Certain twists and actors could be in question but it doesn't out weigh the fun that can be had here.7.8/10

192,dommercaldi,"Great Gore And Kills With A Fantastic Score, But Let Down Massively By Everything Else",4,5 October 2020,"Pros:
1. The gore and violence are extremely brutal, which is what you want from a slasher, especially one of Halloween's infamy.
2. The make-up and practical effects are superb, thus they add a lot to the horror via the gruesome kills.
3. The one-shot take of Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney/ Nick Castle) engaging in a killing spree in peoples' homes, whilst trick-or-treaters hustle outside, is simultaneously seamless, tense, and beautifully pulled off.
4. The score is eerily fantastic, particularly the original score by John Carpenter which always heightens the tension and suspense.Cons:
1. There are far too many cuts and edits and they're jarringly distracting.
2. The jump-scares are cheaply inserted and they fail almost every time.
3. Most of the acting performances are ridiculously stale and uninspiring.
4. For some strange reason, the Father (Brien Gregorie) and Lumpy (Vince Mattis) get out of their truck to investigate the crashed prison bus, whilst the prisoners roamed all around them. Surely they would have driven out of there and then called the police?
5. The sub-plot of Dana Haines (Rhian Rees) and Aaron Korey (Jefferson Hall) investigating the Michael Myers case for their podcast goes absolutely nowhere and is therefore a waste of screen-time. In addition, the sub-plot of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) estranging herself from her daughter and grand-daughter is underdeveloped.
6. The humour is inappropriately placed and it's just not funny as it feels forced.

a few things could be better like that new story line in which we get to know that strode is not...myer's sister ? why they did that ?
Also the chemistry between the new teen actor couples were not so great like their acting too but those were minor flaws.
The scene in which myers killed the driver of the car and the officer and escaped we never watched. they never showed that.Also the new...loomis is not what Donald used o be but that was to be expected.thing is after first 30 minutes the movie grew on me and got better and better as the hour passed.we got a real Halloween atmosphere and thriller scenes here and there once myers was free to kill. the gore was great and the final battle took my breath away.Jamie was a great scream queen as always and all in all if are in to those slasher films and especially if u love Michael then don't miss this entry.for me is the best Halloween movie after the original 1978 film it's 1981 sequel, part 4 (return of myers) and part 7 (h20).Grade B (8 out of 10)my new Halloween ranking from best to worst excluding Halloween 3 which has nothing to do with myers so I leave it out.1 // Halloween 1978

197,thenolanfan,Review - Halloween,4,26 November 2020,"All there is to this film is some great kills, but I disliked their approach to Michael Myers.In the original film, Michael Myers can be interpreted as a metaphor for all sort of things that the viewer like to believe (e.g., Evil, Toxic Masculinity, Post-Vietnam incertitude). But, the 2018 version depicts Myers as a lame psychopathic boomer.Another flaw of this film is the absence of suspense, I think that they were aiming for a more brutal approach, but as a suspense fan, I found that disappointing.",Halloween
198,elliotte2,Cash grab!,4,24 January 2020,"Having Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis was great for marketing, unfortuantely any true horror fan or Halloween fan will leave this movie feeling empty.1. Pacing is off. Movie seemed heavily edited with scenes slapped together.
2. People that seem important to the story disappear, with no reason. Probably a result of the heavy editing.
3. People are stupid in horror movies, I get it. But people who have encountered the horror should not be the same level of stupid as an ordinary joe who first sees a slasher. It's like watching Walking Dead after five seasons of killing zombies getting killed stupidly by a single zombie.
4. Time/space portal-This is a small town, yet it takes cops 30 minutes to drive across it at night, but a scared teen somehow can run across the same town in 5 minutes. Either it is a small town or it is not, can't be both.Halloween H20 seemed miles ahead of this movie.",Halloween

And whilst it's definitely quite satisfactory compared to today's horror films, it lives up to its appealing title.So what gets you thinking that Halloween might be a good selection for a horror title? If you're expecting violent slashing and true horror, you'll get the graphic killings, but the film relies on the predictable violence for horror. The climax is definitely intense and several scenes are suspenseful, but all that's left is the music and violence. But that never stops Halloween from being a great slasher movie.Although some sequences are slow and it may start heavy for some, Halloween 2018 is certainly worth joining this horror series.

200,darkreignn,"Happy Halloween, Michael",7,23 October 2018,"It's been a long time, hasn't it? When the series seemingly died off when the credits to Rob Zombie's ""Halloween 2"" rolled (a movie which I loved, by the way), critics and audiences weren't impressed, and the series was left at a standstill. Clearly, Rob Zombie's white trash, ultraviolent, depraved style of filmmaking wasn't striking a chord with audiences, though I found it to be particularly riveting, especially ""Halloween 2,"" which I thought breathed new life into the franchise, but now is not the time nor the place to discuss that. So, after ""Halloween 2,"" I can only assume the producers didn't know what to do. Do they hire Rob Zombie for a third film? Do they start from scratch? Or do they make a direct sequel to the first ever ""Halloween"" film? Clearly, they thought that was the correct answer, and here we are in 2018 with ""Halloween,"" the sequel to ""Halloween.""Everyone seems to be absolutely adoring this film, and that's because it plays to peoples tastes by basically being a remake of the original. Look, say whatever you want about Rob Zombie's films, but at least he tried to do something different with the second film in his series. Here, while the trailer advertises perhaps a switch in roles where Lori becomes the predator and Michael becomes the prey, instead we get a soft-reboot of the franchise; and yes, this review will contain slight spoilers.Look, I know Michael Myers is not necessarily supposed to have any type of backstory, or motive. He simply enjoys killing people, I get it. And in this film, he enjoys it a little too much. The violence is brutal and most definitely not enjoyable to watch. You can tell Michael gets off being as violent as feasibly possible with his victims. He'll smash their face against doors, stab them through the neck, impale them on walls, and choke the life out of them. Michael likes to kill people, and it's disturbing to watch him do it. The violence is effective, and I'll admit it was nice to see a slasher take itself so seriously and try to scare people through its violence and not by jump scares, because violence in and of itself is frightening. But, and I'm not trying to be a downer here, or seem overly sensitive, but we've watched Michael kill people a countless number of times in other films, so did we really need to see it here? Let me explain.The trailer seemed to say that what we were going to get was Lori Strode, who prepared herself heavily for Michael's return, hunting Michael down. Indeed, if you watch the trailer, that is almost exactly what seems to be implied. This was a bait and switch of the highest order. Instead, what we get is Lori, years later after being traumatized by the deaths of her friends, still being obsessed with Michael, while he doesn't seem to care about her. And this could've been interesting, if it was expanded upon more. What we get is Lori stressing about Michael and instead of hunting him down, she just waits at her house and assumes Michael will find her. Eventually, for one reason or another, he does. But, the way he stumbles upon her house was by pure chance because of one of the most idiotic ""twists"" and character decisions I've ever seen. If it wasn't for that ""twist,"" Michael would've probably never stumbled upon Lori's house. Why was she so sure Michael would come looking for her? Michael never pays her any mind in this film, until they're face-to-face. But before that, he is simply stalking and killing whoever he can get his hands on. It could be Lori, but it doesn't have to be. He isn't hunting Lori, and Lori isn't hunting him. So for the first hour of the film, we watch Lori fearing and readying herself for Michael to find her, and we watch Michael killing random people for fun. Michael doesn't care about Lori nearly as much as she cares about him, but instead of expanding upon the dichotomy of obsession and apathy, the film just turns into a mild house invasion thriller once Michael, by pure chance, happens upon Lori's home.And this was disappointing. They could've tried something new and been daring in this sequel. They could've turned Michael into the prey and Lori into the predator. They could've, at least, shown Michael systematically hunting Lori down, instead of just killing random teens like he does in the original. And ""random"" is just a good word to describe this movie. The writing is sloppy. The script is a mess. The ""twist"" that I mentioned earlier is so unnecessary and convoluted, and only seems like it was written in to get the story to where they wanted it to go because they didn't have any other idea of how to get Michael and Lori to face off.Now enough complaining, because even though I just wasted 5 minutes writing all that, I didn't hate the film. I can't review a film on what we didn't get, but instead on what we got, and what the film has is a perfectly acceptable thriller that I did enjoy, and that I will be watching again. I was thrilled, and I was stressed, and I'll even say that I was scared at points, which is exactly what I want from a horror film. If you want to see Michael kill people, you'll definitely get it. As I mentioned earlier, the kills in this film are violent and disturbing, and if that's what you want to see then you'll be pleased. As a ""Halloween"" film, the movie is okay. It just didn't innovate, and that's what I'm most disappointed about. It's a slasher, just an average slasher, and if you enjoy those types of films, as I do, then you'll definitely enjoy this. I didn't hate this movie. I love the ""Halloween"" franchise, and I enjoyed seeing Michael Myers on the big screen, doing what he does best. But I only hope that in the sequel, if there is a sequel, they decide to do something new instead of rehashing and recycling a formula that's been done to death, even in their own franchise.7/10",Halloween
201,songod-95003,The Spirit is missing...,7,1 December 2018,"By eliminating ""Halloween II"" which was a direct sequel to the first, occurring on the same night picking up where ""I"" left off, they also eliminated an important aspect of Michael Myers.Dr. Loomis came to the conclusion that Michael was not human but the living embodiment of the spirit of Halloween, Samhain. This gave Michael a larger than life profile. Without that supernatural aspect, Myers is just another nut with a knife.Sure he's a hard to kill nut with a knife and certain scenes allude to his possible unkillability but... in the end truly he is just another psycho in a slasher movie. Though he did stay in tip top shape over 40 years of only getting limited exercise!Other than that, this was a enjoyable film. Laurie being a hyper prepared survivalist was much better than the neurotic pill popping version she was in ""H20"".I hope against hope (the film made loads of money) no sequels will be made.

203,Aly200,Worthy to follow the original and good fan service,7,7 November 2018,"Oh my it's another ret-con after we endured Rob Zombie and before that the 1998 ""H2O"", but it was worth the whiplash. Despite the strange choice of stoner comedy director David Gordon Green, the director delivers a solid entry in this long-running franchise especially with the aid and blessing of John Carpenter (who produces and co-wrote the new score).Picking up forty years after Michael Myers' original rampage for which he is re-incarcerated at Smiths-Grove, the psychopathic killer gets loose once more and seeks out the sole survivor of his spree in 1978: Laurie Strode. However, Laurie is prepared for this eventuality and is set on murdering the man who killed her friends. With the aid of her estranged daughter and granddaughter, the showdown is tense and bloody which is what we wanted in a new ""Halloween"".Supporting players in the fray of this horror film includes the likes of TV actress Judy Greer and newcomer Andi Matichak. Greer plays Laurie's estranged daughter, Karen, a psychologist who resents her mother for her paranoia and obsession with Michael and his 1978 murder spree. This dysfunctional relationship results in strains within her own family despite how much she loves her daughter, Allyson and husband, Roy. Soon Karen learns how correct her mother was when Michael attacks Allyson and her friends and eventually makes it to Laurie's compound where they hide. Though she is afraid of the psychopathic killer, it comes down to Karen to take down Michael in an empowering moment for her.As for newcomer Andi Matichak, she brings back the nostalgia of the good girl that actress Jaime lee Curtis brought to Laurie in 1978. Allyson is a typical millennial, but stuck with a dysfunctional family since her grandmother is treated like the town and family nutcase. She does love her parents, but shows disdain for her family's maltreatment of Laurie who she loves dearly. Though she doesn't believe (like her family) that Michael will escape, when confronted by the killer she is convinced and is afraid but does display a bravery from her grandmother in the climax.Returning to the fold after lengthy hiatuses from the franchise, two familiar faces are more than welcome back. First up is stuntman/actor Nick Castle who originally portrayed The Shape in 1978. While Michael Myers has been portrayed by various other actors over 40 years, it was the silence of Castle that first terrified moviegoers. We get to see more glimpses of Castle than we did in 1978, but the filmmakers still cleverly shoot closeups from the side or blur full-faced shots of the actor without his mask. Credit also goes to James Jude Courtney who stands in for Castle in the more intense physical scenes.And then there's our aging heroine, Laurie Strode, portrayed with quiet gusto by Jamie Lee Curtis. Deeply traumatized by Michael's spree, Laurie lives in a heavily armed house in the woods and touts her firearms with astute prowess. While we know Laurie will inevitably be correct about Michael's coming for her, it's easy to understand why her family isn't proud of her and her (well-founded) paranoia. When the final showdown comes it's a pleasure to see Jamie Lee Curtis toting a shotgun and taking down her tormentor; finally facing the man who nearly killed her 40 years earlier (forgetting the original 2nd film).A special mention to the dearly missed presence of the late Donald Pleasance from the original films. You can't replace Dr. Loomis.The original score returns once more with minor tweaks, but is still as iconic as the first time it was played in 1978.",Halloween
204,happyendingrocks,"Rob Zombie: ""No one could ever make a Halloween movie worse than mine.""; David Gordon Green: ""Hold my beer...""",2,6 October 2020,"Even though I nearly walked out of the theater in sheer frustration when I first beheld the astonishing idiocy of this ""only true"" sequel, my loyalty to the series these film-makers told all Halloween fans to pretend no longer exists compelled me to take another look with fresh eyes. What they saw was a movie even stupider than I remember, but my revisit did allow me to pinpoint precisely why this obtuse wasted opportunity is such a crushing disappointment.The big selling point here is the return of Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, who escaped Michael Myers during his original 1978 Halloween night rampage. Nevermind that Curtis has already reprised the role in 3 previous sequels, and her character was definitively killed off in the 2002 installment- -none of those movies happened now because H2018 director David Gordon Green said so, remember?But here's the thing: if everything after the first Halloween is erased, then Laurie is not a woman who has been tormented for 40 years by a merciless supernatural Shape impervious to death who repeatedly resurfaces without warning to terrorize her and everyone in her family; she's just someone who once had a chance fleeting encounter with a serial killer that was promptly arrested and institutionalized and has never seen the light of day since.Consider the recent flurry of coverage on the Golden State Killer, whose malevolent shadow crossed the paths of over 100 people; many of his surviving victims have come forward to articulate enduring far more horrific atrocities than those perpetuated by the fictional Michael Myers, and while their souls are enduringly marked by those appalling events which occurred in their youth, all of them have gone on to build otherwise reasonable lives for themselves, refusing to allow their lone encounter with a monster paralyze them with fear forever- -and they did so while their scourge remained unidentified and at large and still conceivably an active threat, not safely locked away with no chance of release.None of them turned their homes into gated survivalist compounds equipped with basement death traps and spent decades stockpiling an arsenal of weaponry, all in anticipation that one day their tormentor would return for a final confrontation. Yet the Laurie Strode we're supposed to root for here is an admitted paranoiac basket case who devoted her entire life to doing exactly that, all based on what amounts to a few harrowing hours when she was a teenager; she's not the noble heroine we've been cheering on since 1978, she's a pathetic drunken recluse who exists in eternal mortal terror of a sixty year-old mental patient she hasn't had any contact with for four decades.That's not to mention the numerous other times this film trips over its own amended lore, such as when the most obnoxious character in the movie unveils the historic Shape cowl to Michael and declares, ""this is part of you!"" Dude, no it's not; if none of the other sequels took place, that piece of rubber is not a pivotal talisman, it's just some $3 mask that Michael stole from a hardware store in 1978 and wore that one night- -likely chosen at random because it was the day of Halloween so the shop only had a few options left in stock.Even stripped of these existential issues, this is a wretched mess of a film brimming with more inane elements than I have room to list here, most notably a sudden third-act swerve which ranks as one of the lamest and most nonsensical plot twists I have ever seen in any movie, ever. The teenaged ensemble is uniformly vapid and annoying, even by disposable victim standards, yet we're still forced to spend long segments of the already padded running time following their mindless subplots. The adults aren't much better either, except for a steely Sheriff who delivers perhaps the only pragmatic line in the film when Laurie announces that she has been praying every night for Michael to escape custody: ""Well, that was a dumb thing to pray for."" The one consistently intelligent and enjoyable character here is an elementary school-aged kid, who helps liven things up during the movie's sole truly effective suspense sequence but sadly never materializes again after the movie spirals back into a deluge of nonsense five minutes later.There have been plenty of weak Halloween flicks, but this abysmal entry marks the absolute nadir of the entire franchise. And if you've ever heard me rant about how execrable Rob Zombie's contributions to the series are, you'll know that's saying a lot.",Halloween
205,bhernandez2216,"Happy Halloween, Michael",10,19 October 2018,"Finally ""Halloween"" (2018) made one of the best Michael Myers horror film in History. It's way better than Rob Zombies Halloween (2007) and John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). ""Halloween isn't just a really great horror movie... It's a Great Movie, Period.""Trick or Treat? Smell my feet. Give me something good to kill. Happy Halloween Michael Myers. Mohahahahahah!!!",Halloween
206,meathookcinema,Worse than Resurrection,1,19 October 2018,"So, the day has finally arrived. Fanboys have been counting down to this release since the start of the year. Yes, even though the film was due to drop in October. This film is a direct sequel to the first film, the filmmakers told us. We must pretend Parts 2-8 didn't happen.So, whats it like?It feels like some kind of faux sequel made exclusively for Netflix. Even John Carpenter's score feels like a plastic pastiche.It's quite an achievement to make a horror film that has no tension or atmosphere. They have managed with this film. Which is such a shame. The original Halloween has atmosphere, tension and menace by the bucketload.I have never rolled my eyes so many times during any other film. The starting sequence in which Michael is shown his old mask and then all the surrounding asylum inmates start to go crazy made me want to stab myself in the eyes. That was followed by a title sequence which made me scream 'Oh please!' in the cinema. A flattened and deflated pumpkin filmed in reverse becomes whole again. In fact it's a good metaphor for the whole film- inadvertently funny yet tragic at the same time.The only character I liked in this film was Michael. Some of his moments were the only moments of light in the whole affair. When asked to speak by his doctor (imagine an Omar Shariff impersonator doing a dreadful Donald Pleasance impression) Michael stamps on his head making it smash like the pumpkin at the beginning of those awful titles. Michael speaks through violence. Another moment has Michael walking through a house which he has adorned with his latest victims- like a very sick art installation. This was a nice touch and a great (and subtle) reference to the original.But the worst aspect of the film were the nods to modern politics. There is a very obvious thread of 'diversity' that comes across as ham-fisted and very patronising. Theres a character whose gender is unconfirmed (looks like a boy, talks about getting back for dance class) but might be a girl. Strode's granddaughter and her boyfriend go to a Halloween party dressed as Bonnie and Clyde- her as Clyde (male), him as Bonnie (female). Edgy. Except it's not. There's even the grotesque stereotype of the sassy black child. I honestly expected him to exclaim 'What You Talking About, Willis?!' Please have a diverse cast, please don't make it so obvious so that it feels like tokenism.There's also plenty of references to Me Too, Times Up and The Sisterhood (I'm dry-heaving typing this). Laurie exclaims 'Times up!' at one point and screams over her colleagues who are talking over her. She will have her voice heard! The film further reinforces this sense of the sisterhood with a prominent scene really obviously placing Strode, her daughter and granddaughter all together in the frame (I could say more about this scene but I'd hate to spoil the film for you hahahaha). In fact this scene is so repellent that when I saw it I actually screamed 'Oh *beep* off!' in the cinema. But, the film depicted Me Too and Times Up a bit too well. Laurie is hysterical, irrational and deranged most of the time. Kudos to the director for holding up a mirror.For a brilliant, deft, and innovative example of feminism and diversity in a film check out Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman. The 'No Man's Land' sequence epitomises 'We Can Do It!' in action and without the amateur dramatics. The scene in which she recruits the member for her expedition team is a far greater and emotionally moving demonstration of diversity and a sense of everyone being empowered to get involved and engaged.Back to Halloween 2018. The references to the original film will have you rolling your eyes/wanting to scream/wanting to actually inflict violence. Theres a moment that copies the ending of the first film- but with a twist. It's so obvious, heavy-handed and irritating that I felt like randomly slashing cinema seats with my keys. Whats more, they use footage from the 1978 film within this film which is a very risky manoeuvre. Especially when you've made an utterly inept piece of crap. It reminds the viewer that they could be watching a much, much better film instead.But then that's one of the few good things about this sequel- it means there there are screenings of the original in cinemas at the moment and a new Blu-ray release. Every cloud has a silver lining.Oh, and for the record- this film isn't fit to even be compared to Halloween 2 (1981). In fact, the argument should be about which film is worse? This or Halloween: Resurrection. Yes, it's that bad.",Halloween
207,amgee-89551,It's good but not great!,7,20 October 2018,It's good but it's not great. It has some flaws. The third act is such an let down. Michael Myers Doctor is the worst thing in the whole film. Judy Greer is so annoying and her character is badly written. 7/10 it could of been a lot better. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant yet again as an troubled Laurie Strode. The kills was good. Michael Myers was great again. They should definitely end the franchise with this one. Because Laurie and Myers story is definitely wrapped up now. Its not the worst film out of the franchise. I wouldn't put it up with the original one. Tbh I prefer H20 ending where Laurie chops off Myers head. I thought that was the perfect ending to end the franchise. Sadly this film didn't live up to the hype. I'm kinda sad about it because i was really pumped for this new film and I was let down. Also please don't let Danny McBride co write another horror flick because the humour in the film it didn't work and it took me out of the film.,Halloween
208,FelipeCarrillo,"Without Curtis, ""Halloween"" is next on the list of Michael Myers",7,25 December 2018,"Who on planet Earth doesn't watch or at least hear about John Carpenter's horror classic ""Halloween""? The movie of one of the all-time horror maestros premiered on October 25, 1978, 40 years ago; still, its triumphant legacy has aged so well that it's nowadays a bona fide masterpiece in US slasher cinema. Albeit many agree that this blood-soaked sub-genre was founded by ""Bay of Blood"" (1971), ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Black Christmas"" (both 1974), indisputably, when Michael Myers burst into the 70's film scene with a vigorous formula in hands - unaware of the endless, upcoming spate of copycats - a minority knew they were in front of the germ of a new face of horror as one-of-a-kind as prejudiced. He's back now and hell-bent on revenge as you've never seen before.By way of commemoration, the core gears from that fateful, trauma-inducing Halloween night come back to settle old scores. That's right, 40 years have gone by both inside and outside the fiction, and Laurie Strode, our unpredictable scream-queen, has prepared for the inevitable caged in memories; armed to the teeth, she's ready to get an end to this long-time nightmare once and for all. Who will be the victim this time?First of all, the one true sequel disinherits- rightly -the nearly ham-fisted dozen follow-ups and remakes. That being said, David Gordon Green's ""Halloween"" is a fuzzy-intended great homage whether you're looking to know what happened to that babysitting girl, whether what you're looking for is a respectful update, whether you're looking for is a journey of sour nostalgia; on the contrary, a gigantic misfire is it whether you want to experience the same frights Carpenter managed to craft with such a peculiar, simple style, whether you are looking for a new piece of art or, at least, a magnanimous sequel for the beloved horror classic.Jamie Lee Curtis is back, and by far, she's the best of all this. Curtis is a scream-queen by nature as her mother Janet Leigh, one of the founders of the term, played Marion Crane in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ""Psycho."" But Curtis isn't here to scream this time. 2018 has been one of the richest years in terms of productions with heterogeneous women in front and behind the camera in recent times; Laurie Strode and her clan have been one of the strongest driving forces. Fed up with running and hiding, traumatized by a past that hurt aggressively her own daughter, Mr. Carpenter's final girl turns herself into a badass-yet-scared avenger ready to kill this guy off. Honoring the role that became her a big-name actress, the twice Golden Globe winner unfolds an exploration of trauma that's underdeveloped even despite the strong female empowerment the film breathes, often synthetically. Overlooking the character's narrative, structural imperfection, Curtis is a beast as Laurie. The ""Scream Queens"" actress does keep her Horror Queen title alive, the facial metamorphosis by facing Myers off is unmissable, her panic gives you full idea about what she went through in just a couple of seconds; it's overwhelming how she unwittingly speaks volumes about her trauma through hysteria and roughness that brings to mind Lieutenant Ellen Ripley from ""Alien"" or Sarah Connor from ""Terminator."" We all missed Curtis on the big screen, this makes it up.Respecting the timeless original plot of Debra Hill and John Carpenter, the screenplay penned by Jeff Fradley, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green misses the mark diluting a number of expendable modern-day/yesteryear film horror tropes that even if they get a raison d'être in the duties to meet new audiences' expectations and try to satirize its own copies severely harm the reason for this sequel to exist, neglecting its own disciples: fan or not, no one wants to watch a high school costume party with drunk, horny young folk swarming around the screen when you get, after four long centuries, Michael and Laurie together for less than two hours.A heart-breaking letdown and/or dishonorable marketing campaign turns out to be the core purpose of this sequel, misleading with an event that, judging by time and quality, falls short as for the promises out of the trailers. In addition to refusing to dive into Laurie's trauma, the script also does not focus on clarifying the life of Myers, a lost chance knowing that this was the perfect time to give some kind of background, lumping drama, slasher and irony together in an explicitly different way.There are undeniably two leads, but unfortunately, they fade against the disguised and oddly effective symbolism the script deals with. Moving ""Halloween"" into millennial ground is a logical step to take, but not by means of clear-cut overtones such as a feasible money-hungry third entry by Blumhouse or analogical sequences that besides compensating the pains of a woman represented as three, reaffirms once and again the name of the next scream-queen of the franchise, if you don't think so, pay attention to the last shot of the film.The script squanders meaty material with Laurie's daughter Karen, played by Judy Greer. Pierced by a colorless childhood and deprived of any tool to combat against her worst fear, the promising character lacks a good emotional background or, at least, a worthy treatment which deepen in the scars; that's right, bloody serial killer films are not known for award-worthy treatises, but expectations were so high with this Blumhouse project that exceeded the genre itself, overlooking its limitations and commonplace gimmicks.Andi Matichak's Allyson seems to hold the leading spot on many more occasions than you want, not just because of considerable screen time - which strengthens my theory around who the next female protagonist will be - but because of the plot ""weight"" screenwriters inject into the character.The pic does aspire and exhale female empowerment from soup to nuts. The final sequence is a lot to digest in just one bite, ideal for the current social climate, three generations facing their past and present with a stunningly symbolic, arty set-piece; the movie overworks to be progressive as only perpetuates indirectly the conceptions of women in horror films. There is a truly strong, unfocused feminist role around the flick, hopping from its trio of leading ladies to the inane actions given to two of them; one more proof that less is better sometimes, Laurie in the spotlight all the way through would have been more than enough.And of course, in post-Shyamalan times, a big twist couldn't miss. Firstly, it is one worthy of shock, however, even with a character from the original involved, is beyond belief how just a few minutes after such aggressive plot turn it doesn't mean anything, a blow of air. In the genre, the big finale and/or revelation moment must be as powerful and carefully crafted as surprises throughout the footage; this film doesn't even worry about revolving the schemas. There is a similar situation as regards misplaced comical injections coming from scenes that break the tension building down, feasibly by the like of one of the writers and the director himself for comedy; we don't care whether your food is a chocolate brownie or a sandwich, give us more ""Halloween.""Aesthetically, it's a crowning achievement. Despite rawness and hyper-violence executing some homicides, there are no gore, tension and thrill, and yet the movie is masterfully crafted. In this field, killer-victim sequences shine the most, as the possibly memorable but devoid of substance false one-shot murder scene with Michael breaking into a neighborhood to make his own thing the Halloween night. Throwing the uber-generic chases off, the final 15-minute sequence is disturbingly oppressive, with Laurie looking for her larger-than-life nightmare behind a door or inside the closet all over her place, the suspense building and paranoia grate on your nerves, adding the cat-and-mouse final chase, which, by the way, is visually dynamic.Even with all that, Michael Simmonds' cinematography, no holding an arresting track record, means several engrossing frames, sequences like the recreation of POV murder flashback, the aforementioned finale, Laurie madly shooting, the atmospheric opening sequence and even the nostalgia-packed opening credits are a big win as for the forgotten entries, representing 78's through a modern eye that, aesthetically, belongs to a great, appealing horror film.Who would've thought John Carpenter will also return with a score slightly altered by Cody Carpenter and Daniel A. Davies, of course, playing more than once Michael Myers' chilling theme song. This updated sequel is blissfully able to boast one of the best sound designs of the year and for a genre in a very long time; every blow, shot and creak are incredibly bone-crushing, enhancing the experience even if odious jump-scars over-fly the entire feature.""Halloween"" by David Gordon Green lacks any tension and paralyzing effect as well as own essence and direction - even if you watch it on October 31st, just like I did, - and yet it's a glorious comeback for Jamie Lee Curtis, an old-school slasher with on-the-nose modern deviations which falls by the wayside by juggling too many expendable agents. This sequel had it all to conquer: firstly, Curtis and her fundamental acting skills; secondly, Michael and his brutal knife and legacy as film icon; thirdly, Carpenter himself as advisor and composer; then, the suspense and thriller genres prone to some hard-to-watch well-crafted scenes; and lastly, horror mastermind Jason Blum's production company, which alongside Universal Pictures have become the most creatively and commercially successful horror-film machines in Hollywood today. Green's festival darling does not flee or hide, rather, toys and misleads with the maneuvers of its star.",Halloween

So late doing this now but here it is, don't get excited because this film was actually the biggest letdown of 2018. I'm not gonna spend too long on this, but, ya it was not that good. The good things about the film were some of the cool deaths and it entertainment and who could forget, Jamie Lee Curtis's outstanding performance and how they tried to change it with Laurie's character having gone 'insane' and 'paranoid'. The bad's included the boring and dull style of the film, the dialogue and lazy characters that I couldn't give a crap about. The ending also left the film feeling quite pointless and unneeded after all of the anticipation. Overall, Halloween is a dull, no where near as good as expected reboot with very little going for itself apart from a official and unwanted sequel that I really don't want to watch.",Halloween

It's a nice nostalgia hit to see his senseless murdering spree and all the nonsense choices most characters make.It's also nice that movie is somewhat self aware. It jokes on itself with obvious quotes, such as ""So you're the new Loomis, now"". Some funny comic relief also.I'd recommend it only to Halloween die hard fans.

That being said, for a sequel that came after the time-span spectrum of sixteen years from its previous entry, I did expect a tad bit more than what we've received.There's so much in Halloween 2018 to cherish, yet, so much to lament about. I honestly can picture a perfect Halloween sequel hidden deep behind this movie but for now-which is fine-I'll just have to accept this reasonable sequel. Then again, I remember, the first time I viewed the OG Halloween I actually wasn't a huge fan of it. I found it to be predictable, corny, and somewhat shabby. Fast-forward two years later, I rewatched it, and now, it's one of my all-time favorite horror films to date.

I mean the Halloween franchise came out of an excellent masterpiece in 1978 but its sequels made the franchise unrecognizable, not to mention the torture porn that are the Rob Zombie remake movies.The verdict is in, and this movie is good, hell, it is amazing!As you should know by now this movie picks up 40 years after the events of the first Halloween movie, but in this retconning of the story Michael Myers was subsequently arrested after that tragic evening that left four people dead and a very traumatized 17 year old Laurie Strode.Laurie Strode has been waiting all those years to take her revenge and she just might get a chance to after Myers and a few mental asylum patients escape during transfer.Beyond the slasher and suspense I will dare to say the movie is very profound, it dares to ask the question of what should be the punishment for such monsters like Michael Myers? It also puts the notion of if there is a slight possibility of forgiveness and redemption.The acting is magnificent as the Queen of all scream queens (Jamie Lee Curtis) returns to the franchise as a fighter ready for war and the new generation of characters are as important to the plot and the interactions are flawless.I can honestly give this movie a 9 out of 10.Not only is this a must for lovers of the genre but I am also happy to erase every other sequel and stick this one into canon.",Halloween

Ahh, so, three Halloween's it is, the original, a remake and a sequel to the original, it makes sense. So this one, is a remake of Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, with Laurie Strode, still in the picture and Michael's niece playing a lesser role. Mixed with Halloween H20, when it deleted it's previous installments to bring back Laurie Strode. So this one deletes all previous installments including H20, and the remakes and takes place as if Michael was caught on Halloween night 40 years ago. It's a shame, Halloween II (the original, haha) was dope.... As with Halloween 4, Michael is being transferred, crap happens he breaks free and goes after his family, but in this alternate universe Laurie didn't die in a car accident and left her daughter, in this, she goes full on Sarah Conner, and prepares, because she knew Michael would escape one day, raising her daughter John Conner style also in preparation, which neither took seriously til things got real! And yep, Mikey makes his way back to Haddonfield in time for Halloween and of course the Halloween dance at the high school. So the whole teen element of this one was kind of pointless, just seems to be added in to attract the younger audiences to an R-rated film? I dunno. I guess that one teen is also Michaels niece so... And just how supernatural is Michael... how is he able to track down a group of teens, who all go their separate ways, and he hasn't been in town for 40 years. Smith's Grove must have the internet for inmates. All leading to a showdown between Ellen and the Queen Alien, crap, I mean all leading to Laurie and a showdown with her bro...

Best mask since the original. A superb cast and at it's heart is once again the excellent performance by Jamie Lee Curtis.

She was written brilliantly in this movie as an reclusive depressed woman with PTSD that she never fully recovered from ever since she survived being killed by Michael Myers 40 years ago. Secondly, is the treatment of the other star of the film, Michael Myers.Michael Myers was sort of given a mythological spin in this film. On the surface, the character Michael Myers is depicted as a deranged nutjob and a human that bleeds like the rest of us, despite having the ability to take bullets and crush skulls with his bare hands. But in this film Michael Myers is a sort of force of nature as well as a human character.Just when you begin to wonder about the motives of his killing sprees you are given answers from the victims themselves. Almost everyone that is killed by Michael Myers represents a person that loses their innocence or falls victim to dark emotions such as lust, greed, obsession, and fear. Take Laurie Strode, a poster woman for the one who is traumatized by her dark past. She secludes herself from the world, always prepares for the worst and tells her daughter that the world is cruel and harsh and you have to eat or be eaten.Her quest to kill Michael Myers and her prayers for his escape so that she can find a chance to kill him is very symbolic of her quest to move on from her trauma. A traumatized person needs to sort of let go of he darkness eating at her soul by facing her fears and not running from them. After many years, she confronts her daughter and apologizes. She visits her granddaughter after any years and overcomes her agoraphobia. Laurie Strode is surviving and is a survivor of Micheal Myers (darkness and dark emotions)Many of the victims in this film have darkness inside them. There is an obsessed doctor, that very obsession led to his demise, and he was killed by Michael Myers shortly after becoming consumed by his obsessions in the form of committing murder himself in order to achieve his lifelong goal. Another victim in this film was an unattractive young man who is constantly rejected by women he is attracted to. He drinks because of this and is soon killed by Michael Myers shortly after being rejected by a girl. Then there are the reporters, hungry for a story, and instigating their way to that goal of obtaining it. That greed and lust inside them led to their death at the hands of Michael Myers. Last but not least, the sexually starved libertine baby sitter and her boyfriend, driven by lust for sex, and unaware of its consequences. Shorty after having sex, she and he are killed by Michael Myers.Before I end this analysis I will review the film for its acting, and directing now that I covered the surprisingly deep script. Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and the actor who played the doctor was okay but most of the victims lacked something though. They just weren't afraid enough despite being face to face with menacing Michael Myers. I thought the acting by victims in the original Rob Zombie Halloween was way better. I also thought the stuntman that played Michael Myers in the original Rob Zombie film was way better than the one in this film. Yeah he was brutal but he didn't bash through any walls or bust down any doors in this move like he did in the Rob Zombie movies. Michael Myers was a bit stiff in this film. I also thought the quick cuts were way too quick and the film had way too many jump scares. The nostalgic inclusions felt like a spoof at times too.Last but not least...the beautiful synthwave soundtrack by John Carpenter. He blended the classic score very well with his remixed notes of organ and other strings. I'd rate this film as one of the top 3 Halloween films, hands down. Halloween fans will definitely love it and perhaps even the non-fans.",Halloween
223,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Halloween : H40,8,21 October 2018,"So we have a new sequel/new timeline on our hands. In this version, Laurie has become obsessed with Michael or more accurately obsessed with the thought of killing him to the point where it strained her relationships with her daughter and granddaughter. I quite liked the family dynamic in this film. I liked that they were all strong competent women. In all of ways this film does feel like a feminist film. The women aren't running around half naked (The only nudity in the film is a flashback to the original 1978 movie). They're not stupid or ditzy. Its pretty refreshing.The kills in this movie are pretty gory. Its not like the first one where its mostly stabs and very little blood shown. Like people's heads get smashed in, jaws get ripped out. If you're squeamish, its not going to be the film for you. One kill that did bother me though (surprisingly not the kid) was this random lady when we first see Michael on Halloween night with all the trick or treaters running around. The director chooses to do a one take tracking shot for this scene, and Michael watches this lady on the phone in her house talking to someone about locking up and he goes inside and kills her. Like, it felt almost out of character. I know a lot of the movies are now retconned but Michael has never really gone out of his way to kill random people. Besides whatever his main target is (like the babysitters in the first one) he usually kills people that pose a threat to him or get in his way or that he needs something from (like clothes from a mechanic). It felt oddly mean spirited. She didnt do anything, he didnt need anything from her. Not too mention, she wasn't important character, it didnt advance the plot in any way, we dont have a later scene where her body is discovered. It felt like it was thrown in just to have the film have a high body count. I could have done without it.There's also a twist with the new Loomis (and hey, he's even referred to that in the film) that I thought was so lame. I get that they wanted to subvert your expectations, because the film does quite a bit of that...but it feels almost silly. The suverting does work in other ways. Like the film has a lot of nods (not just to the original but the other Halloween films) so as an example you get a scene where Allison is in class and she looks out (and if youve seen the Halloween films before, you know how its going to play out) but instead its Laurie that is outside the school. So little things like that I think worked. I could have also done away with some of the teen stuff. The most compelling parts for me were Laurie and her family. I think I like many others came to see the return of Laurie and a bigger scale see Laurie kick ass (and while she does) there is also a lot of teen nonsense going on. I just didnt care about those characters that much and those scenes felt very generic slasher movie. I needed more Laurie and more of that family dynamic. The film is also funny in moments, but it knows when to tone it down and keep it serious. It felt like a good balance.Overall, I really liked the film and think its a really good sequel. The ending perfectly wraps up this franchise (though I somehow bet it will undo all of that to make another film since this likely will make a TON of money).",Halloween
224,dormesher-21565,The True Sequel to the John Carpenter Classic,9,19 October 2018,Halloween (2018) this movie is absolutely amazing and a brilliant sequel to the John Carpenter's classic from start to finish this movie keeps the feel and spirit of the original building suspense and keeping the mystery of Michael Myers.Michael Myers is brutal in this movie and I love it and ive got to say this is the best Michael sinse the original and the look is amazing with the mask looking old and more realistic again unlike the other sequel's that came before.Now the for me greatest part of this movie and the shining star is Jamie Lee Curtis her performance in this film is amazing and a realistic take on what it's like to be going through a trauma and the life she is going through being distant from her family and being isolated is such well written story and honestly her performance moved me to the point I almost shed a tear for the first time in a horror movie. I've got to say Jamie Lee Curtis was just perfect in this movie.Now this isn't movie isn't as good has the original but it comes really close however I do think although it does the suspense really well John Carpenter does it slightly better and there some comedic elements to the film I didn't think worked and really didn't match the rest of the tone in the film like when the cops are talking about sandwich in the middle of a suspenseful scene just seemed abit odd.There is a twist in this movie that I really liked involving a Dr character and I've got to say I really liked it and I'm glad they did this move because the character was beginning to feel like a copy of Loomis and I didnt want that Loomis is my favourite character in the franchise and I didn't want them to just copy and disrespect the character so twist really elevated that character.My favourite scene in the movie is the shot when Michael follows the woman in the house it's all filmed through the window and you see Michael behind her such a great kill and a brilliant shot scene felt like a John Carpenter shot and a true Halloween scene in my opinion.Verdict 9.4/10 this is a brilliant movie and my new favourite sequel H20 will be moving a spot down on my ranking this is how you do Halloween. Jamie Lee Curtis is amazing and in 10years this will be the performance everyone remembers.,Halloween
225,TuesdayThe17th,Holloween. This film is unaware of how atrocious the acts being committed actually are,5,17 January 2019,"When i heard Halloween was being remade, again, I was excited to see how it was gonna turn out but when i heard David Gordon Green was directing I had mixed feelings. Though Green has crafted some top tier comedies and dramas, he has never done a horror film until this. I wasn't worried too much however, because his films are always very good and as a director, he is no stranger to violence. All of his movies tend to include some violence, sometimes even in excess. With all that said, I was intrigued to see the turn out.....but unfortunately, this movie was bad. Close to terrible actually. This film is not at all what it was hyped up to be and i am floored by its praise. It reminds me of when ""Joker"" was immensely overhyped. First off, it was cool to bring Lori Strode back since this movie was supposed to come directly after the first film. However, I absolutely hate jamie Lee Curtis as she is an awful awful actress. She only hurt this movie. Her character clearly suffered a psychotic break at some point and is an idiot to say the least. Her house, her hidden underground bunker, and generally every location used in this film sucked. I absolutely HATED the sets and locations. Nothing felt cozy on the eyes and the wood in Lori's house all looked too new and recently constructed. This film takes place 40 years after the original film, and is a direct sequel. So any ""Halloween"" film in between the original and this movie simply doesn't exist here, therefore depleting much of Michael's intensity and threat because in this universe, he hasn't gone thru the trials and tribulations of seeking out his sister multiple times, killing an uncountable amount of people along the way. The crimes committed by Michael so far at the beginning of this film , though very serious, still feels a bit..underwhelming... Miles Robbins character actually talks about this in the beginning of the film, almost like the director felt a similar way. Another thing is the movie shows a little too much of Michael's face and shows a lot of side views and he looks...not really scary. In rob zombies ""Halloween"" Michael Myers was 7ft tall and had long hair that covered his face preventing us from seeing what he truly looks like and this was a much more intimidating look. This film has too many characters as well,many of which have an unfinished story arc. Maybe this fact, along with the minor-ish crime set up of Michael are actually smart moves, setting the stage for increasingly menacing and intense sequels, but its very rare that a sequel is better than the first and these facts still hurt this film majorly. Clearly many young people are reviewing this film who have no real sense of terror in a movie and who dont know the true essence of "" Michael Myers"". The NUMBER ONE FLAW however, is the fact that the entire film feels EXTREMELY HOLLOW. There is no empathy. No sympathy. No sad parts. If this was truly a good film there would be a moment or two of deep emotions. Michael Myers, along with the rest of the cast and crew of the movie don't seem to realize that the acts Michael commits in this film are horrific and devastating. There are no emotions to emulate a loss of someone or even sadness at all for that matter. This type of shallow filmmaking left this movie with out atmosphere, with out dread, with out any true meaning... The scary scenes cut too soon and never give us that sinking feeling that I usually get with...hmmm....almost every other horror movie. I thought Gordon Green would pull of something unique with great style and tension. He did not. The film is not unique and definitely not very tense. It does have its moments of cool kills but even the kills become boring and repetitive. They are still the best part of the film, though they don't make up for its flaws. This movie should have been scary as hell.",Halloween
226,Jared_Andrews,The Best Halloween Film since the Original,7,27 October 2018,"You know the Halloween mask, you remember the iconic score, and who could forget the terror? They're all back in this sequel to the horror classic, and so is Michael Myers. There's certainly reason to be excited. For everyone holding their breath as they wonder if the new movie will meet the hype, feel free to exhale. This one doesn't disappoint.The original Halloween from 1978 is a masterpiece. It's a film as influential to the genre as any that came before and any that have come since (aside from Black Christmas, but that's another discussion for another time). The Halloween films that followed are ... well, let's be diplomatic and call them ""varying in quality."" Over the course of those wildly uneven seven sequels, big baddie Michael Myers was shot in both eyes and blown up. He went into a coma, awoke from the coma and nearly died. He was nursed back to health and later electrocuted. Did you see all that? Do you remember it? If not, don't worry - none of that information is relevant to this movie.What we have here is a direct sequel to the original film. Director David Gordon Green and co-screenwriters Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley pick up the story 40 years after that infamous Halloween night. Right away we see the fingerprints of a filmmaker who is really going for it. Not a single shot is dull. The camera whips between tight zooms and unnerving kinetic sequences of the mental hospital that houses Michael Myers (reprised in the role by Nick Castle in certain scenes). He has been institutionalized all this time and is now being transferred to a maximum-security prison to live out his remaining days.Meanwhile, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the babysitter who lived, has been living a bit differently. She has spent 40 years collecting guns, shooting her guns and preparing to kill Michael with all her guns. She strikes a delightful balance between paranoid lunatic and total badass. Sadly, the downside of Laurie's radical behavior is the effect it has had on her relationships. She's twice divorced and has a daughter she rarely sees because of the aforementioned paranoia and guns.Of course, we as viewers know that her obsession in preparing for Michael's return is not unfounded. During the facility transfer, Michael escapes. After a quick pit stop to pick up his favorite mechanic uniform, Michael heads off to say hello to a few babysitters and find Laurie.Because he tends to say hello less with words and more with the business end of giant knives, the sheriff (Will Patton) and Laurie catch wind of what's happening soon after he arrives in town. Then comes Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), Michael's latest psychiatrist. Laurie greets him with, ""Oh, you're the new Loomis,"" as she practically winks at the camera. It's one of the film's many nods to the original - including the use of the stalker cam, the opening credits and a certain balcony scene.As those three figure out their plan, Michael continues increasing his kill count. He soon works his way through the town's teens and crosses paths with Laurie's granddaughter, who is fresh off a disappointing night at the school dance. That's where the film loses focus. Laurie is a compelling enough character to carry the story largely on her own with only small doses of help from her family. The high school plotlines don't need to exist and only do so to provide disposable bodies.Later, the sheriff and Dr. Sartain spot Michael stumbling down the sidewalk. The doctor firmly declares, ""He's property of the state. We mustn't harm him."" First of all, no. The state would be perfectly content with harming a mass murderer to protect innocent lives. Second of all, ""mustn't""? Get real. Laurie was wrong about Dr. Sartain. This dweeb's got nothing on Loomis.A few of the best and most frightening sequences of the film follow, and Green is fine in his direction of these moments. He doesn't quite set the atmosphere in the masterful way that Carpenter did, but he knows how to build suspense and execute a scare. And between Green's skill for suspense and a few sprinkles of humor throughout, we end up with the best Halloween film since the original.",Halloween
227,cgearheart,Satisfying reboot/sequel,8,26 March 2019,"David Gordon Green has certainly made a reputation for himself as a very colorful director. Being the director of a Halloween reboot is something we never expected from him, but it's something that actually worked in his favor. Halloween (2018) works as a delightfully violent and awesomely aligned sequel to the original we've all been waiting for.

229,scb_coldsteel,A classic slasher film in the making that honors the original while keeping its own voice.,8,22 October 2018,"So I watched the new Halloween this weekend at the theater. I had high hopes that this could somehow make up for the complete and utter failure which is the Rob zombie versions and the other bad sequels. Still what more could a movie do with a classic slasher like Michael Myers from a bygone era in horror? Overall I was completely impressed with this movie in near every way. It is proof that the slasher genre is not dead yet and in the hands of a skilled director can even flourish.The plot of the movie takes place many years after the first Halloween. The movie ignores every film after the original Halloween acting as a direct sequel. This not only freed the director up to ignore some of the convoluted elements of the old films, but also allowed the film to really capture a lot of the classic elements of the original while keeping its own voice.The plot progression is a bit cliche at times and sometimes kind of silly, but that never really took away from the slasher fun. Michael Myers breaks loose from his insane asylum and sets out in a bloody rampage to track down Laurie Strode and her family. Along the way he leaves a gory and suspense driven trail of bodies leading to a final confrontation between the Michael Myers and Laurie. Realistically the plot was just an excuse to see Michael Myers again, but it still was a substantial improvement over many of the other films.There are many moments in the film that will have fans of the original clapping with glee. Sometimes it did feel a bit like fanservice, but it never felt overdone dumb or unnecessary. A big plus of course being but the film did not rely on cheap thrill jump-scares, but tried to create genuine moments of terror and dread.The director David Gordon Green really captured the elements of the original film while still making this movie his own. The film perfectly use a hypnotic score that constantly left you on the edge of your seat as Michael Myers stalked his victims. I had chills most of the movie as Michael Myers hunted his victims like prey. The film was gory, but it wasn't senseless boring torture porn like in the Rob Zombie adaptations. Each murder made Michael Myers seem both terrifying and relentlessly evil. A lot of the more gruesome kills aren't even seen on screen, all we are left with is the brutal aftermath.While David Gordon Green certainly paid homage to the original and stay true to the spirit of the series, he still managed to make a film that was his own. The film kept the classic use of sound and lighting to create suspence and intrigue while building upon the elements of horror, but it also added a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor to the genre. There were some genuinely funny moments peppered throughout the film that poked fun a traditional slasher stereotypes and worked to lighten the mood. Not only was the movie gory and suspense driven, but it was also all around entertaining.I don't have a whole lot to say about the negatives in the movie. The plot at times was a bit silly and cliche and the final confrontation did feel a bit too much like fanservice. There were also a few subplots that could have been completely ignored or handled better. Still, it's hard to find too many faults in the film overall.The movie really did a good job bringing the slasher genre back into Hollywood's attention. The movie at a nice mix of suspense and gore while staying true to the classic elements of horror that made the original so endearing. Michael Myers really comes across as the dark and ominous boogeyman that he was supposed to be. I thoroughly recommend this movie to any fan of the horror genre. A 8.5 out of 10.",Halloween

Of the course the series has suffered some indifferent movies so this very welcome. This is its true sequel that it deserved. It amazing to see this compared to all the sequels and odd follow ups. We see an aged Jamie Lee Curtis but she plays her role very well. I don't know why intill know it's taken that look to make a competent follow up film. That being said this more of a reboot.

238,keelhaul-80856,"Ok, but I don't see what all the hype is about. They can't even think of an original title/subtitle anymore.",5,20 October 2018,"My wife was excited to see this, and from the previews and reviews, I figured it would be ok. Indeed, it was OK. However, the hype and hooplah for this one (""It isn't just a great horror movie, it's a GREAT MOVIE PERIOD"") just fizzled out for me.1) Isn't this the 3rd time they've just called one of these movies ""Halloween""?? How many times are we going to rehash this?2) They just scrapped all the other sequels and made this the ""new"" and ""only"" sequel?"" LOL WTF?3) The whole ""female badass who survives and the men are useless"" theme was nuanced and fresh in 2005, but it is kind of played out and predictable at this point. There are some badass women, and some women who can be very cunning and play that role well-- I just find it a bit overused, and the script/plot is written to make cops and men look completely useless and pathetic-- laughably unrealistic in most situations.4) All of these films are the same-- the dude walks like he's constipated while people scramble to escape, but he just methodically trudges towards them and kills them, while they trip and cry. He murders people door-to-door, and the place is surrounded by cops(and there would be choppers and vehicles and people looking everywhere), but everyone just seems to take Michael's escape as a big joke, and apparently none of the police or veterans in the area are smart enough to take down one idiot with a mask on foot(who has no special forces/military/cop/martial arts/spy training, but rather spent most of his life in a cell of some mental asylum). Really??? Every cop in every vehicle is always dead, no one can shoot him, and all the men are useless, even though this would never happen in a massive manhunt. It is like being drunk, watching your buddies do a police chase on GTA IV or some nonsense lmao5) Why don't they just name these movies ""God: Invincibility Mode""??? For Christ's sake, Michael gets hit with a crow bar to the head, shot with a rifle, his fingers blown off by a shotgun, run over by cars, and yet he barely mutters a sound or gets a broken leg or debilitating injury??? It gets a bit absurd at some point, and laughable.6) There is NO exciting news to learn or true mysteries revealed in this, despite the teasing of that, other than the idiotic doctor who murders a cop and thinks he can continue to study Michael while he murders people without restraint!!! Seriously?!?!? We were like, WTF??? How did these seem remotely plausible or make any sense? Whoever put that in the script was stupid, and thought this was some diabolically clever plot twist. It just seem beyond stupid and unrealistic.7) They leave room for another whole pack of sequels with this obvious ending of not seeing Michael actually burn up.8) Jamie Lee is a dumb Hollywood leftist who supports gun control clowns, yet her movies are all bout women learning to shoot and using guns to smartly defend themselves.(When pushed, she claims she is for ""common-sense"" laws, and banning ""assault"" weapons, but they always push for more, and these restrictions are still anti-2nd amendment) Not just one-- She has a small arsenal of weapons that help them defeat the killer, but I guess people in real life that do this are just ignorant savage rednecks to Hollywood, while they make a fortune portraying iconic folks that deal out gun violence willy nilly. Makes total sense to me... (sarcasm)9) Jamie Lee Curtis is not really that attractive, and looks like a dude at times. At least she grew her hair out since the Activia days I suppose. I don't really see what the hype is-- regarding her OR this movie. Very mediocre, though I'm sure many will disagree. She looks like a boy with no lips.There was absolutely NOTHING NEW to see here, and while the movie delivered enough entertainment to make it fun, I feel I crave much more from a horror/thriller film. This is just lazy, paint-by-numbers Hollywood crap. It serves its purpose, and the cinematography, mood, violence, tension, and lighting/music are all great-- It just doesn't do anything spectacular and offers up the same old stuff you've seen 4 million times, basically, to make some more money for the industry. Visually and action-wise, it is a 9. On originality, nuance, scares, and logic= more of a 3.",Halloween

240,FKDZ,Bit of a disappointment. Zero originality.,4,20 February 2021,"So the only way I can start this review is comparing it to Halloween H20 : 20 Years later because in my eyes these two are pretty much the same movie. But the 2018 remake doesn't do anything worthwhile to exist next to H20.To me this seemed like a rehashed H20 for newer audiences. But with none of the actual great kills and horror that we expect from Michael.The entire story in this movie stands on some very weak legs. And the first section is a bit of a drag if you are already familiar with the series. First of Michael's escape, he somehow just crashes the prison bus and escapes. We see nothing of that, instead we get another callback to the scene where the mental patients escaped in the original film with them walking over the street. That also kind of touches on another point and that is the lack of creep factor. No weird characters, everything is pretty flat.About the characters and the acting, the acting is good, if you've seen any of the previous movies you'd know. The characters are as shallow as they can get though. And in general kind of disappear like Allyson's boyfriend. I still don't get why Allyson even had that love interest at all. That side plot was a enormous waste. I could see a great kill(s) if Michael encountered him cheating on his gf somewhere outside or whatever. The setup is there, just nothing happened.The kills, now this is where the real disappointment lies. The reveals and the actual moment of murder are incredibly dull. With off camera stabs and slow rehashed reveals. Like how could they skip the scene where Michael stabs a guy through the neck and hangs him on the wall but only show the aftermath?! As a slasher movie, it disappoints hard. And it seemed very tame. With also most notably very little creativity or memorable kills.Michael's end/the final scene, damn talk about a underwhelming ending. The bait and switch in the end is funny. But everything around that was pretty meh. And the way they kill Michael... lets just say H20 knocked it out of the park.I hope the eventual sequel will amp up the stakes and gore. Because this is barely a slasher.The movie overall is solid, its well directed, great soundtrack (of course) and it just looks good. That said its a subpar rehash and I'd rather watch H20 than this again.",Halloween
241,headly66,Does anyone even care that a serial killer is on the loose?,2,21 October 2018,"In what is ultimately just another Halloween movie with a ton of teen slashings I find one thing rather confusing. Myers is a famous killer, and in Haddonfield, Illinois he would be a monstrous legend who is imprisoned what seems like just miles away. Yet when he is being transferred to another prison he is on a bus with other insane inmates with a doctor, one guard and a bus driver, no police escort, no state Troopers. After he escapes we see more of the same, he kills 7 people including a kid but no major alert to stay indoors, no federal response, the sheriff seems involved but it's mostly just a lone small town officer with a pistol chasing leads with again, no backup. And Laurie Strode's daughter seems unfazed that Myers has escaped just miles away and is on a murder spree, just like her mother said he would be.In real life we have seen these kind of escapes and they are plastered all over the news, but I have never seen one as flashy as a teen murdering psychopath returning to his hometown on another rampage. In reality the schools would have been shut down, Halloween cancelled, no teen parties would be taking place, plus there would be a massive FBI and state police, SWAT presence.Then Myers kills 4 more people (for a total of 11 so far) that the police discover yet somehow there is no curfew, lock down or any concerned parents making their teens stay home. Only after the 12th killing does the officer tell people to lock their doors.Dumbest line in the movie:
Doctor: ""remember, he's property of the state, he mustn't by harmed""Escaped prisoners are killed all the time.Also, how would Myers, after 40 years of not talking in an insane asylum know anything about Laurie Strode's family? How would he know she had a daughter and granddaughter? How would he know where anyone lived? He would not understand the internet or cell phones and wouldn't even have a pay phone or phone book. Not that Laurie would be listed.",Halloween
242,Beyondtherain,"Big fan of the series, cool film but took a lot from Rob Zombie's...",8,15 April 2020,"Saw this film opening day, had tears as soon as the first credits rolled with the reversed pumpkin. Overall I felt Michael was a mix of 78 and 2007 Rob Zs Michael but, they took a little too much steps from Rob. From shaky side camera angles showing Michael walk after a victim from the shoulder up, we then get a scene of Michael putting on an old dirty mask for the first time(seem familiar?) we get a happy family breakfast scene with a goofy dad, bad jokes, & they even took the head stomp kill just to over exaggerate it...This Michael is sooo strong he can step on your head once and it goes *BLDUEUEJWKLLS* yea sure Jason Voorhees, lol. And did anyone know they used the same Stunt Coordinator as Rob Zombies Halloween? Lol yea his name is Rawn Hutchinson. A classic dude... Another big one they took is the bathroom stall kill, Michael is slamming the guy around the stalls exactly like Rob zombies Michael when he killed Joe Grizzly for his jumpsuit. Like i said, I enjoy this movie but from the cop car scene and on the movie almost failed because of their little twist... I pray Halloween Kills is consistent, fresh, and very original with no forced twist and turns. One great thing I can say is this was 100x better than H20 but, best horror of 2018? Uh I didn't see the ""Suspiria"" remake in Theaters cause I had no idea it was coming out but I think that would've blew my mind more than Halloween 2018 in a dark theater. With all that being said, overall whenever I watch this film it feels like I'm watching a less gritty polished up version of Rob Zombies Halloween 2...Sorry!",Halloween
243,n-kefala,Good franchise,8,28 October 2018,"There are many plot holes and characters make idiotic decisions, but watching three generations of women take on Myers is irresistibly satisfying. John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is as near to perfect as any slasher film can be all those years, but this movie is a solid addition to the deathless horror franchise and it is the proof that horror icons never truly die. David Gordon Green directs the new ""Halloween"" with an enthusiastic feeling and he didn't mess with one of horror's most iconic characters, and that's always a good thing. Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect on her role and this new ""Halloween"" it's the best film since the original in this long running series and an excellent sequel most fans will enjoy. nikisreviews.gr",Halloween

245,lnvicta,"A flawed but welcome return to form for the franchise, and for slashers in general.",7,21 October 2018,"After Resurrection and the Rob Zombie films, it's an understatement to say that Halloween (2018) was a pleasant surprise. Laurie Strode was given the T2 Sarah Connor treatment and is now a formidable badass, having waited forty years for Michael Myers to escape prison so that she can kill him. This is the showdown we've been clamoring for.If there's one thing Halloween (2018) gets right, it's the protagonist. Laurie Strode is treated with respect here, unlike in other sequels (I'm looking at you, Resurrection). She's been training for forty years, preparing, praying for Michael to break out of prison so she can kill him. Her daughter had to learn how to fight at a very young age, and eventually Laurie was deemed unfit to be a parent. Because of this, they have a strained relationship, and it's believable. There's even a satisfying payoff at the end. Horror filmmakers take note: a little character development goes a long way.There's also Laurie's granddaughter, and this is where the flaws start to creep in. The teenagers and their drama was the weakest aspect of the movie. Sadly, most of the second act is devoted to these characters that we really don't know or care about. There's Laurie's granddaughter, her boyfriend, the comic relief guy, her ditzy friend, and her friend's boyfriend. That's the extent of their characters. Naturally, they're only there as fodder for Michael (except the boyfriend who mysteriously disappears from the movie), but the fact is that we're wasting time watching these characters interact when there's a much more compelling story on the sidelines.Comedy is used fairly appropriately in the film, the little boy being the clear standout. But there are a handful of farcical bits that are either ill-timed or simply not funny, or a combination of both. This prevents the movie from developing an overall atmosphere. This isn't so much a problem in the third act, thankfully, but the finale would've been more effective if a bleak atmosphere had been established earlier in the film. A few more wide shots of the streets of Haddonfield in the fall weather; more shots of Michael standing in the background eerily out of focus; limiting the comic relief to one, maybe two characters max; any of these could've been helped.That's not to say that the direction is poor. Far from it. This is the closest the franchise has felt like a Carpenter movie since the original. Gordon Green does a good job of keeping Michael in the shadows - even unmasked, it's difficult to make out his face. You really get the sense that he is, purely and simply, evil. Background action is also prevalent and well done (as in, there's not a music sting whenever Michael comes into frame). Again, a breath of fresh air after the Zombie films which had the subtlety of a sledgehammer.This is an excellent sequel to Halloween and a thoroughly enjoyable, well crafted slasher movie on its own. It's wonderful to see the Boogeyman on the big screen again, and now he has finally met his match. Is it a perfect movie? Absolutely not. But Halloween (2018) is something to be celebrated if only for one thing: it proves that slashers can still be scary.",Halloween

261,droog-56936,Michael Returns,5,9 October 2019,"A sequel to the 1978 horror masterpiece, this movie takes great pains to capture the unsettling fright of the original. The problem is that it carries the weight of countless horrible sequels and worse yet it struggles to contend with the over the top in your face bloodbaths that were the Rob Zombie reboots from 2007 and 2009. It's hard to go back to the atmospheric carefully crafted screen classic that John Carpenter delivered so many years ago after the Rob Zombie reboots shoved the brutality up to the forefront in such graphic fashion.
This movie starts off on shaky ground and just degenerates into an almost comedic hokum type mess. The need to shove MeToo ideology into everything might actually have worked in this in more skilled hands. Instead we get the equivalent of Home Alone as Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode sets up a bunch of hidden traps and secret rooms. No terror can be conveyed by Michael Myer at all if he's involved in silly pratfalls. Go rent the original or the Rob Zombie remakes instead of this bloodless letdown.",Halloween

264,TheMovieDoctorful,Cynicism Has Come To Your Little Town,1,20 October 2018,"I had my strong reservations about this film for a while. The concept of a Halloween film that removed 30 years of story and character development from canon to satisfy John Carpenter's ego felt like such a slap in the face to fans of the franchise. Whether you love or hate the twist of Laurie being Michael's sister in Halloween II, it's a fundamental part of the character. We've had 30 years to accept and embrace their familial connection and it's become as much a part of Michael's identity as his iconic mask. Add to that the fact that every clip I had seen of this film had been awful, and my expectations for the film were subterranean. While I originally put this film above Halloween H20 and below Rob Zombie's first remake, on re-analysis, it's probably the 3rd worst in the series above Resurrection and Halloween III.There is good stuff here. The music is my 2nd favorite score of the year and one of the best scores in the franchise, modernizing the classic Halloween theme while still retaining its iconic sense of demonic dread. Also, as is the case in the best Halloween films, the movie does a great job of establishing that nobody is safe from Michael's wrath. There's a very brutal and genuinely frightening scene in this film involving Michael killing a child. This not only raises the stakes of this movie, but makes me look at Michael in every other Halloween movie with that much more fear. The scene where Allyson emotionally destroys a creepy ""nice guy"" is satisfying, empowering, genuinely funny and another franchise highlight. At least some of the actors are good. Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding in her comeback role as Laurie Strode, she really brings Laurie to life and gives us perhaps the most complex, relatable and proactive take on the character to date. Virginia Gardner is likable and charismatic as Vicky and she has great chemistry with the rest of the cast. She'd actually make for a much stronger and more interesting final girl than Allyson. Jibrail Nantambu is adorable, endearing and lovably snarky as Julian. Apart from the aforementioned scene of Allyson shutting down a nice guy, Julian provides the only other comedy in the film that's actually really funny.I have no idea why the screenwriters thought it was such a brilliant idea to have nearly every line of dialogue and plot point be a stab at the sequels or the remake. It felt unnatural, cringeworthy and petty. Remember that awful scene in the trailer where Dave (The dumbest character in the film, by the way. Get it? Because sequel fans are idiots according to this movie?) asks Laurie if Michael was her grandmother's sister and she replies that it was ""just something people made up to feel better about themselves?"" (What the Hell does that even mean?) There's even more dialogue after that about how they all agree that killers are scarier when there's no motive. There's no precedent to this, no reason for them to bring it up, they just do it to bash it into your skull that the sequels and remakes aren't canon anymore. The first 20 minutes of the film are Laurie and 2 idiot doctors constantly repeating how Michael has no motivation and is just pure evil. Imagine 100 jabs in the eye like this and you have this godawful script, all while ripping off numerous scenes from Halloween II, Halloween H20, Rob Zombie's Halloween and others. In essence, they're pissing on franchise fans while calling it rain. It doesn't even feel like they liked the original so much as they just hated the sequels. This is some of the worst meta writing I've ever heard.The movie obviously wants to recreate the magic of the original Halloween, but in doing so, it forgets all of the asinine and outdated cliches that the original film set that were mostly subverted and eliminated by the 90s (Thank you, Wes Craven). The mentally ill are crazy, evil monsters? Check. Limited character development to focus on the thrill of the chase? Male characters have to be stoic and can't show emotion? Check. Teenage girls can only survive Horror movies if they're virgins? Check. The original could get away with these because it was directed and acted in a way that was beyond exceptional. Andi Matichak's performance is awful, boring and lifeless, so she's unable to raise the credibility of a character that has no discernible identity beyond her ""Final Girl Checklist"" of personality traits. She can't even react to the death of her friends or the appearance of her grandmother's boogeyman with even a hint of emotion.As uninspired and awful as Matichak is in this film, Toby Huss is 10 times worse as her father. He plays the role like he's in a bad 80s direct-to-VHS comedy, not a single one of his line deliveries is even remotely convincing. His only purpose in the film is to provide comic relief to a story that never once needed it. Miles Robbins is also unbearable in the role of Dave, a stoner so cartoonish and stereotyped in his characterization, he belongs in a film from 1980.The lighting is terrible, especially in the ending. During the last 5 minutes of the film, I genuinely could not tell you what the Hell was going on. The cinematography lacks the Halloween mood felt in the original, the Jamie Lloyd trilogy and even the flawed Rob Zombie films. Every frame of those previously mentioned films evoked the style and tone of October 31st. Apart from the scenes of Trick-Or-Treating, Halloween (2018) never captures that. You could tell me that it took place during Thanksgiving and I would believe you.Halloween (2018) is a terrible movie. The cinematography and lighting are garbage, only 3 of the acting performances are good, the characters and story are beyond cliched and the script is cynical and soulless. Why does this movie exist again?",Halloween

Just when it should have ramped up, they threw in a completely pointless plot point that literally did nothing for the story, apart from make it go on for longer.So many pointless plot lines that went nowhere and a stupidly obscure ""twist"" at the end that I'm not sure I get. Was Judy Greer in on it, the whole time? If so, why did she put on an act for so long? She acted like she didnt agree with her mothers life, she acted like she was unable to control her fear, then right at the end, she switched and it was as if they had planned it all along. What would have happened if Michael would have never broken out of prison? Would they have took the act to their graves?How does Michael Myers know how to drive?Why did they feel the need to make the Dr a killer, just to murder him, seconds later?Why was every man in the movie portrayed in a negative light (or killed)?What was the point of the boyfriend?Why are obsessive fans blinded to how mediocre this movie is?How are they going to make a sequel?Will the sequel be a melodrama about an estranged mother/grandmother being welcomed back into the family?

266,joshbarton15,Michael Myers IS back.,7,21 October 2018,"Retconning franchises has become a bit of a trend in Hollywood recently, studios deciding to disregard franchise entries after the first and usually best film. Forty years after the original events in Haddonfield, Halloween is the eleventh film of the franchise but the new direct sequel to the original, with the same name. You keeping up?Forty years after his murder spree, Michael Myers returns to Haddonfield intent on killing Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). What he isn't prepared for though is a fully prepared Laurie who's been waiting and training for his return.It's great to see one of the most iconic movie villains of all time gracing the big screen again in Halloween and I'm glad to report that David Gordon Green does a great job in making Michael Myers feel like a terrifying and unstoppable force of nature in this brutal sequel. The body count is high and there are a couple of genuinely great moments that really do highlight why Myers is such an iconic character, a moment involving a motion sensor light and a tense showdown in Laurie's house being the icing on the cake.The film becomes a tad predictable in places and there is some forced humour in there that often feels out of place, which could be down to Danny McBride's presence in the writing room. I really liked the decision to have Laurie Strode as a Sarah Connor type figure, hell-bent on exacting revenge on Myers for traumatising her entire life. It would have been easy to just have her as a damsel in distress again however, it makes this sequel feel fresh and not just a carbon copy.Talking of Laurie Strode, Jamie Lee Curtis works wonders to bring her new-found fierceness to life. The original scream queen is certainly back and it's so good to see someone like her return to a role that opened so many doors for her career wise. The supporting cast is made of capable actors playing incredibly stereotypical characters for a horror film.While it may not better the original, which was always going to be a hard task, Halloween is great fun and a worthy sequel that offers something a little different to the original.

Hardcore violent deaths (without relying entirely on gore to sell the scares), genuine scares (despite some being obvious and predictable), excellent cinematography (I love the slow panning and creepy shots of Micheal). They even knew when to threw in some great humor. It is a great mix of everything that we love in the horror movies we grew up with, all with a modern twist.

277,tresm87,A powerfully pummeling updated return for Michael Myers and Laurie Strode for the ultimate showdown in Haddonfield where the mayhem began 40 years ago.,9,28 October 2018,"As a fan of this franchise for decades I can honestly say this is the best film since the original by miles. Although it wipes many films away from the franchise canon, and alters the storyline, it perfectly picks up and builds off the classic original with fantastic execution. The film begins with an outstandingly chaotic tension filled sequence that foreshadows Michael's return from isolation and sets the overall tone. As we reunite with Laurie Strode played insanely passionate by the legendary Jamie Lee Curtis, we get a great look at how the past events have affected her and her family. As things progress and the inevitable happens, things start getting incredibly intense when the bloodshed and unhinged obliteration by Myers kicks off. The sheer vicious force that Michael has always been is probably portrayed in the most intimidating pulverizing way of the franchise in this film. You can feel the evil and power that The Shape possesses throughout, and the kills are on a different level of brutality this time around, and are built up brilliantly in every sequence by dense suspenseful atmosphere captured immensely with supreme camerawork similar to Carpenter's original vision. James Jude Courtney epitomizes Myers's movements as well as overall demeanor amazingly and I believe is the best Myers so far. As the finale comes around, the stage is set for the ultimate face off between Laurie and Michael and it culminates to an absolutely riveting finish that's up there with the best moments of the entire franchise. The soundtrack is impeccably scored by Carpenter and compliments the film beautifully which is no surprise. While there were some characters that were a bit ridiculous and a twist that seems very misplaced, they are minor nitpicks in the whole film. The comedy relief was sprinkled throughout and honestly worked in the spare utilization. Overall this is Halloween at its finest and a welcome entry. If they do decide to continue making more films I'd be very happy.",Halloween

The characters in the film were awful and I did not care one bit about them. You obviously root for Laurie because of the original film, but they tried to make her into some badass GI. Jane type person in this film...it doesn't neccesarily work too well. This is not the proper sequel Halloween needs and I don't know if we will ever get it. It's certainly better than most of the other films in the franchise but it still falls short. However poorly executed it may be, It'll provide mild entertainment atleast and can be a solid halloween season movie to kick back and watch.",Halloween

280,moviemattb,The Best of the Halloween Sequels,9,21 October 2018,"After seeing many ""Halloween"" sequels, which I find some that are good, and some that are not. For Rob Zombie's, he made one that was okay, and one that was totally on crack. How does this was fare up? Here are my thoughts: the movie retcons all the sequels and Zombie's as this one acts as a sequel to John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" No more of Laurie Strode and Michael Myers being siblings. It takes places 40 years, as Michael Myers is brought back to prison again, then escapes again by putting on his mask and start going around killing people around Halloween night. For Laurie, she is dealing with PTSD, as she is getting herself prepare for Michael's return and take care of him once and for all. I got to see it last night, and I am happy to say that this is the best of the ""Halloween"" sequels. I actually did found a ""Halloween"" sequel that I love that is about as good as the first one. However, its not a perfect movie by any means, but here is why. There were some moments that were a bit predictable as you would know who is going to die, and some of the humor that aren't funny. Also, I wish the title wasn't called ""Halloween,"" as they could have come up with a better title if this was called either ""Halloween 2018,"" ""Halloween Returns,"" or ""Halloween: The Revenge of Laurie Strode."" Nevertheless, the movie has some good humor that did made me laugh as this was written by Danny McBride, Jeff Fradley, and David Gordon Green. Both McBride and Green have done films like ""Pineapple Express"" and ""Your Highness."" The script they wrote is well written, and Green does a really good job directing the movie as he is capable enough to create a moody atmosphere, and have moments that are suspenseful. John Carpenter returns to do the music, and teams up with Cody Carpenter and Daniel Davies as they have done an outstanding job with the music, and it is awesome to hear the ""Halloween"" theme and other familiar themes that Carpenter has created. The opening titles is terrific, and really gets me in the right mood that I am watching a ""Halloween"" movie. The movie is definitely well filmed, and the visuals themselves are really strong. The performances are terrific. For Judy Greer, I thought she did a good job for playing the daughter of Laurie Strode, which I can't spoil the movie, but you'll see what her character does. Now for Jamie Lee Curtis, she is awesome, and was nice to see her kick Michael Myers' butt. She is Laurie Strode. It was also nice to see Nick Castle returning as Michael Myers, while some was done by James Jude Courtney. The movie does have gore in it, but its not as gory as what you say in the Rob Zombie's one, which they take things up a notch with the gore. Michael Myers in this movie is the definetly the Michael Myers we all know and love as he is what he should be. Not in a thorn cult, nor trying to give any reasons on why he is evil. Sorry Rob Zombie, but you miss the point on what makes Michael Myers evil. He is an evil force, and there is always a mystery behind it. The movie does have some nice twist and turns, and nothing more I can say about it. One last thing, the last act of the movie was both suspenseful and exciting at the same time. Can't spoil it, but you have to see it for yourself. If you are not a fan of Rob Zombie's or any of the sequels that don't live up to John Carpenter's classic, then this is the one you will enjoy. I enjoy this movie, and I am giving it a 9 out of 10.",Halloween
281,gamerz-18042,"Shambles, no more please",5,29 September 2020,"Some ridiculous scenes and dialogue, followed by implausible scenarios.A deranged psychiatrist, neurotic mother, brainless characters thrown in.The dialogue and acting from some characters (policeman) in particular was pure facepalm.I can't blame Myers for trying to kill everyone",Halloween
282,cappiethadog,Meta-halloween,6,6 November 2021,"Michael Myers is flesh and blood, a real person, not some monster that manifests itself when we close our eyes. This is how John Carpenter and Debra Hill imagined Haddonfield, Illinois' most wanted. As a six-year-old child, in ""Halloween"", Michael(Will Standin) stabs his older sister Judith(Sandy Johnson) repeatedly with a knife he procured from their kitchen. The POV shot of the killer was John Carpenter's contribution to film language. For better or worse, every slasher flick that followed in its wake would adopt the same style in a murder event, usually involving a teenager. Dressed like a clown, still gripping the bloodied kitchenware, Michael's father asks: ""What have you done?"" It's not the boogeyman; it's a disturbed little boy. Adults aren't supposed to believe in the boogeyman. Children are irrational; adults are rational; that's how it was in 1978. When Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis) placates Tommy Doyle(Brian Andrews) that there is no such thing, this evergreen pagan holiday cipher, the babysitter needs some convincing of her own. She has seen the boogeyman herself, but neither Annie(Nancy Kyes) nor Linda(P. J. Soles), Laurie's two closest friends, can verify Michael's existence. The reality/fantasy binary starts in earnest. Up to this point, Michael Myers is corporeal. His assignation of boogeyman, merely a default position; Annie simply didn't see Michael in time when Laurie told her to look, as both girls walk home from school. Further proving Michael Myers' humanity, Laurie manages to lift up his mask during a struggle after having discovered her friends' bodies in Annie's house. A face is there: Michael at 21. In David Gordon Green's ""Halloween"", and the penultimate follow-up ""Halloween Kills"", the filmmaker has a cultural reason as to why the audience never gets a good look at Michael Myers, senior citizen.It would turn out to be the last shower she'd ever take. Alfred Hitchcock shocked audiences when Marion Crane(Janet Leigh) was stabbed to death by the Bates Motel owner in the proto-slasher pic, ""Psycho"", starring Anthony Perkins. Hitchcock broke an implicit rule with the audience; you don't kill the protagonist midway through the film. Without Leigh, our rooting interest, moviegoers had nobody to identify with. More than likely, moviegoers of lore would be horrified, not delighted by a serial killer's actions. But that was 1960. As Laurie Strode, Jamie Lee Curtis' replacement, Scout Taylor-Compton, in the 2007 Rob Zombie reboot, lacked her predecessor's gravitas and modern audiences, arguably, sided with Michael Myers, cheering on the body count. Curtis' return is important; it repositions Myers back from antihero to antagonist. Under David Gordon Green, a Terence Malick acolyte, the franchise had a filmmaker who didn't make sadism the point. Green made a thinking man's ""Halloween"", but his genre-transcending ideas doesn't stop the narrative cold to announce itself; the ideas are seamlessly integrated, hiding in plain sight if you're looking for horror not only within the diegesis, but outside, as well. ""Halloween"" introduces us to a different kind of assassin, the character assassin. Jefferson Hall(Aaron Korey), a podcaster, has a partner-in crime, Dana Haines(Rhian Rees), who generously calls themselves investigative journalists in order to snag an interview with the famous Laurie Strode at her fortified compound. They're hacks; they specialize in true-crime. They're online hacks; professional journalists don't offer money over people's intercoms in order to gain access. The UK-based reporters sport British accents, which gives them a veneer of undeserved respectability. Before tracking Laurie Strode down, Jefferson tries to get Michael Myers on the record: ""Say something,"" he implores. Dr. Ranbir Sartain(Haluk Bilgnier), a protege of the ate Dr. Loomis(Donald Pleasence) is more than pleased to host these quasi-journalists. The mainstream press stopped calling him. In the car, Jefferson expounds on his grand theory to Dana, which belies the sketchiness behind the whole enterprise. One monster beget the creation of another monster, Laurie Strode, the twice-divorced mother of one. Jefferson's rhetoric addresses the false equivalency phenomena that is part and parcel of our media landscape. Laurie doesn't like these award-winning podcasters' line of inquiry and shows them the screen door before they can complete their hatchet job. Up to this juncture, ""Halloween"" plays like an episode of the conspiracy-minded television series ""The X-Files"", created by Chris Carter. It's no accident that Jefferson's partner is named Dana. The conjuring is purposeful. For the time being, Jefferson and Dana are the focus of ""Halloween"". The legend of Michael Myers is like the latest X-File, which were nothing less than fantastical cold cases. Laurie Strode is their material witness. Fox Mulder(David Duchovny), however, believed in magic. Jefferson is explicitly un-Mulder-like, when he tells Laurie: ""I don't believe in the boogeyman, but I do believe in Michael Myers."" Mulder would believe in the boogeyman. Dana Scully would believe in Michael Myers, then come around to Mulder's side, whereas Jefferson Hall and Dana Haines believe in nothing. ""Halloween"", with this line of dialogue, deconstructs Michael Myers into a binary: man/myth. It calls attention to the fantasy industry complex, a term that author Kurt Anderson recently coined. Laurie changes course, understanding the damage these online journalists can do to her reputation, agrees with Jefferson that Michael Myers is indeed a human being. Filmically, feminist film theory taught us that women are punished. ""Halloween"" updates the feminists, showing us how final girls are punished for having the audacity to fight back. Jefferson can paint her as a vigilante and land her on the FBI list. In an homage to ""Psycho"", Dana is murdered in a gas station restroom. For good measure, Jefferson dies, too, in gruesome fashion. Running through the journalist's mind as he fights for every breath must be Michael Myers' inordinate strength, which belies his biological age of sixty-plus years. When it's too late, Jefferson Hall believes more in the boogeyman than the existence of Michael Myers. Unfortunately, he won't live to tell the tale on his podcast. Listeners would have decided for themselves if his attacker was man or myth, or more pointedly, if the online host is broadcasting fact or fiction.David Gordon Green plays revisionist; he looked at the original ""Halloween"" and seized on Tommy Doyle's fear of ""the boogeyman"". Laurie, as is her job, being the adult in the room, puts the boy's fear to rest, ensuring him that there is no such thing. In the reboot, Laurie Strode is older and wiser, but ironically, sounds more like a child than adult, because she, too, believes in the existence of monsters who walk among us. And the irony is two-fold: Jefferson Hall and Dana Haines work in a medium in which fantastical tales about boogeymen and their ilk are accepted as conventional actualities by a devoted fabulist-friendly subculture. Fox Mulder was searching for the truth in a world that still believed in truth. ""Halloween"" reimagines Mulder and Scully as modern-day podcasters. Mulder has friends now. We all, to some extent, believe. Dr. Sartain, just like his mentor, Dr. Loomis, knows that he has a patient that science can't answer for. Sartain knows about that Halloween night in 1978, the night that Loomis fired several rounds of bullets into Michael's chest, then fell off the patio balcony. Lying prostrate on the lawn below, Loomis was confident about his patient's inability to survive, and goes to check on Laurie. When he returns to peer over the deck a second time, Michael is gone. You could say ""Halloween"" cheats. The audience saw Michael as a child, and briefly, as a young man, maskless, confirmation of his biological makeup. John Carpenter was breaking the law of physics. David Gordon Green, however, recognizes this disconnect from materiality. ""Halloween"", and it's sequel, ""Halloween Kills"", explores the fluidity between reality and fantasy.In both movies, the filmmaker makes the purposeful creative choice of obscuring Michael Myers' face. Shot from behind, in the former, we can see that the serial killer is carbon-based; the unmasked man's appearance aligns with his chronological age. Balding, facial hair gone white, and a wrinkled forehead, are all signifiers of biological disintegration, and yet, David Gordon Green dislocates them from a face the audience can positively ID. In ""Halloween Kills"", the mugshots of two inmates materialize on a television in Mick's Bar; it's breaking news, a bus transporting Michael Myers and other prisoners crashed. None of the bar patrons are paying attention to this important clue that would help them with the manhunt, furthermore, Michael Myers' face is blurred, therefore protecting his identity from moviegoers. Anybody could be the boogeyman; no one man is the boogeyman. That's why the hospital mob goes after the wrong mental hospital escapee, the second inmate; chasing the wrong man is beside the point, though, the wrong man fits the hoi polloi's version of the truth that ""evil dies tonight"". Tommy Boyle(Anthony Michael Hall), all grown-up, leads the charge for justice. His truth is as valid as truth itself.Laurie Strode knows her old nemesis better than anybody else. She commiserates with Sheriff Frank Hawkins(Will Patton), both laid-up and high on morphine in a shared hospital room. Laurie Strode understands that ""you don't beat Michael with brute force,"" but rather, she implies, you beat the boogeyman by not believing in him. ""Halloween"" goes metaphysical. Michael Myers is a myth living in the real world.David Gordon Green recycles the old line from John Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", as a critique on the modern world.""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.""No. You print the facts.",Halloween
283,Eric_Cubed,Horribly disappointing.,4,19 January 2019,"I'm not sure why so many get down on Rob Zombie's first Halloween remake. Great characters, acting and driving ambiance. Also, Zombie laid a new spin on it, examining and giving expression to the transformation of the psychopathic boy into the relentless monster-who should be larger than life, a super evil villain, that could only be played by a professional wrestler or a type like that. The physical threat should equal the inner threat. What if Jaws was half the size he was portrayed? The movie would then be laughable. The juvenile script for this inane remake, like Van Zant's Psycho is a by the number's affair, with ghost sheets covering one teen body, Lourie opening a closet hamper and surprise! there's a body on the top shelf, and another stapled to the wall with a kitchen knife-surprise! exactly the same as the original. It's verse chorus verse: Michael escapes on Halloween, goes back to Haddonfield and starts killing; Laurie and the new Dr. and the cop track him down and ""kill"" him. Laurie Stroud's daughter remarks about Laurie's agoraphobia: ""try to understand, she needs cognitive behavior therapy. ?!? Was this a joke? It didn't seem like one. Why not do a little research to find the appropriate treatment for the condition? Easy fix. Shows disconnection in the writers.Whenever anyone does a remake they must realize the cultural conditions and societal circumstances when the original was made are long over. Christopher Nolan showed us all how ""reformation"" could be done beautifully with the Batman reboots. The current Zeitgeist must not be ignored, as it was so painfully obviously in this film. It's not like we need the metoo movement shoved in our face; rather, the collective fear of uncertainty, meaninglessness and the unknown could have been potentiated very effectively. These existential fears are already woven into Michael's character, the terror without a face. No one is interested in screaming teenagers anymore. Credit is due though, to a few minor twists and the movie and as a whole competently put together. Sadly, if this was the first Halloween film, it would have been great, but that doesn't make it great, at least culturally. Very disappointed, though entertained.How about this: the boy Michael is born a very mildly deformed with a pale, ambiguous facial structure, which becomes more this way as he grows. Everything bad imaginable happens to him (the idea of ""evil seed,"" aka: The Omen, is so bleached now, it's just stupid), include bullying, neglect, abandonment. In dreams there is a vague indication of those with a magnetism for the evil of the world. Make it relentless. At age 10, in the most shocking and obscene way imaginable, Michael plucks his baby sister from the crib and kills her. He doesn't touch the bowl of candy in front of him. He kills three more on Halloween night as they knock. Finally, he kills his sister and boyfriend. It's now time for the asylum and Dr. Loomis. Michael is separated from the general populace, but has some interaction with similarly disturbed children. There is a treatment team talking about the many theories, interventions, meds etc. FIve years later things have changed. Dr. Loomis, now a oxycontin abuser (the hospital provides him unlimited access), breaks down in front of colleagues, ranting about evil and his belief Michael has something inside him that draws the ""sins of the world."" There is nothing metaphysical or religious about this. It is a yet to be measured phenomena, giving rise to the idea of evil, freedom and choice. We later learn ""Michael"" is an anagram for a Nazi in charge with opening the first McDonald's in Germany in WW2 and whose salutation was ""Hile Mac!"" (Okay, that was a joke). Now you see we have something both original and adding up the culturally collective Gestalt of 2019. It's like swimming happily in sun soaked waters and suddenly your feet no longer touch the bottom and you've swam into a cold pocket and shark's fin is approaching. Sheer, relentless terror ensues. Perhaps Michael slips into Laurie's home and spies on them from the attack, slowly messing with them and killing them. Laurie sees what is now the final result of the deformity of ""no face"" and Dr. Loomis finds her. I could go on, but you get the idea!Caveat: I'm a very stable person with an active imagination, so there's no need to report me (yet another fear, the terror of ""being reported for nothing,"" losing it all, and due to the absence of privacy, never being able to recover. Now that's scary).",Halloween

Most of the Halloween movies require you to sit through bad parts but after the millennium the Halloween movies were becoming unbearable with the Resurrection and the Rob Zombie versions.

286,mitchell5954,Good Sequel/Reboot But A Bit Overrated,7,14 November 2018,"Halloween 2018 is the latest, and hopefully the last, entry in the Halloween franchise. This is coming from someone who is a major fan of the Halloween brand. Halloween is the first slasher film franchise I became a fan of. I grew up with Halloween. I didn't get into Freddy, Jason, and other horror icons until later on in my life. This franchise means a lot to me. I don't mean I hope this is the last because I hate this film. I enjoyed this movie and it ended on a satisfactory note, which is why I hope they don't make any more. The Halloween series has had its ups and downs, though mostly downs. This is why it deserves to finally go out on a high note.Halloween 2018 has been getting rave reviews from many critics and fans. Does it deserve this praise? Mostly yes, though I do think it is a tad overrated. People have been saying this is the best Halloween movie since the original. I disagree with that. I will say I think it's better that parts 3, 5, and 6 (though the Producer's Cut of Halloween 6 is an improvement). I'm one of the very few people who don't mind Halloween 3 that much. I used to hate it, but I've warmed up to it over time. It's certainly better that Resurrection and the Rob Zombie entries, which are a complete disgrace to the Halloween name. It's better than H20. H20 I think is overrated. Halloween 2018 is a better version of H20. However, I still feel that Halloween 2&4 are the best sequels.Halloween 2018 retcons all of the previous sequels and presents itself as the true continuation of the original classic. A part of me is a bit upset with that given that I love Halloween 2&4. However, given the sorry state the franchise has been in for the past few decades, I do believe the franchise needed a somewhat clean slate.As I said, Halloween 2018 is a better version of H20, in both the story and the conception. Jamie Lee Curtis wanted to do H20 as a final time as the character, Laurie Strode, and to finally put the series to bed on a high note. We know how that ultimately went. This film seems to be Jamie's second attempt to finally give the series the end it deserves.The story and setup feel very similar to H20 as well. It follows Laurie, who has been traumatized by her encounter with Michael. She has a child (in this case a daughter and granddaughter) whom she has a very rocky relationship with. Suddenly Michael comes back and starts killing again. Now, Laurie must face and conquer her demons, just like in H20. However, unlike H20 this film actually has atmosphere. It feels like a Halloween film, not I Know What You Did Last Summer with Michael Myers like H20. It also has a better cast, and Michael looks a lot better as well.I do like this film and for a few reasons. One is the atmosphere of the film it truly feels more like an old Halloween film before H20 (excluding part 5). The score, composed by John Carpenter himself, had a lot to do with that. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a great performance and is the real heart of the piece.
Michael Myers is actually intimidating again. I really like the mask too. Honestly, this might be my favorite version of the mask out of all the movies.I like how they maintained the mystery and mystique of Michael, and not try to over explain why he's evil like some other installments have done. He's once again the shape; a mantel he hasn't really had since part 4. Some would even say since the original. There were some good looking kills as well.I do have problems with this film though. It does drag in spots. Laurie is the best aspect of the film, but the movie chooses to give focus to less interesting characters quite a bit. Much of the film is mostly typical slasher movie fare; enjoyable but not the most memorable. While there were some good kills, there were also some standard ones to. Some of the attempts at humor don't work either. The film doesn't do anything especially different, other than one element which I wish they had gone into more. Like I said, much of it feels like H20, though done better.Overall, Halloween 2018 is a solid entry in the franchise. I don't think it's the best sequel, but a worthy one. I recommend anyone who is a fan of Halloween, or just someone wanting to watch an entertaining horror movie, to see it. I hope they don't make the same mistake as with Resurrection. The movie ends the franchise on a good note and it should be left alone. But, you know how Hollywood is. Chances are, whether in two years or two decades, there will be another Halloween movie gracing us.",Halloween

The scene were the camera follows Michael around when he first arrived at handonfield is excellent and really well done. The ending was also really well done and Michael Myers looks really creepy and chilling!Now for the bad bits. The biggest problem with this film is there is zero tension. I don't how they managed to do that as Michael Myers actually looks scary. Also the directors usually do comedy and they tried to put comedy into this film and it simply doesn't work. Concentrate on the horror!!! The twist with the doctor was awful and completely not needed. Finally some of the teenage actors were terrible and really annoying.Overall it's good but it could have been so much better. I think i might actually prefer H20.

293,donb-519-335075,So - so at best,6,29 October 2018,"Halloween 2018I told my son-in-law as we were approaching the theater that I wasn't expecting much - and, sadly, I was right. Even with John Carpenter's help, still great music, and thankfully ignoring the 42 remakes, Halloween 2018 was ok at best. The parts I liked best were the homages to the original: three girls walking down the street from home; pinning the young man to the hall wall with the butcher knife; reprise of Annie's song as she waited for the original Michael to strangle and kill her, and a few others.But there was no Dread or Tension - hallmarks of Halloween I. In the original, Michael stalks Tommy as he walks dejectedly from school after having his pumpkin smashed. He peers from behind the hedge and then among the wash hanging outside Laurie's window. And the music, which I believe was the best part of H I. The music was there in H 2018, but was not used to good effect. H 2018 was not creepy of scary or anything even close to the classic.But the movie was not the worse part of the evening's experience. The audience was. In a testament to how far our society has decayed, two late teen, early twenty year old girls had their sister/daughter, who was at best 6 years old, in the movie!! Just shows anybody can pump babies out, but it takes a little bit of common sense and parental judgment to raise children. But that was not even the worst for me.In the movie, Tommy who is a very innocent little boy in H I is replaced by a street-wise, foul talking little boy (again about 6 yrs old) who repeatedly used the F word as he talked to his babysitter. And the audience thought it was hilarious!!!I have continue to resist thinking that our society is doomed as I watch the ridiculous glorification of actions deemed obscene and sinful just a decade or so ago, each day on the news. But maybe I should stop resisting. Maybe we are doomed.",Halloween

There is only Jamie Lee running around in her 60's looking like a total idiot, the survivalist idea was rather tiresome, the acting was sub par, the silly comedic relief had terrible timing,I am not too sure how many more reviews I can make on the modern horror genre, but I must say one thing, at least Rob Zombie wasn't involved.",Halloween

Yes, it is a flawed film, but it is the only one that follows with the same spirit, story, and suspense of the original.
Apparently Michael was eventually captured by deputies on that night 40 years ago and taken back to the insane asylum. There, he receives a new psychiatrist, Dr. Sartin (Haluk Bilginer) who devotes his work to studying the man behind the mask. Two journalists played by Rhian Rees and Jefferson Hall wish to visit the infamous serial killer, Michael Myers (James J. Curney and Nick Castle), but he remains unresponsive. Michael, along with the other inmates are carted away on a bus to a state facility. Well, the bus crashes and Michael and the other inmates escape. Who would have thought?
The audience knows where he is heading, along with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Apparently, she has gone off the deep end with her PTSD. She has created traps, safe rooms, ammunition, a defensive perimeter with lights, cameras, and just about anything else she can think of. Unfortunately, her obsession with this has estranged her from her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer). Laurie does have a slightly tenuous relationship with her granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak). One faithful friend is Officer Hawkins (Will Patton) who was one of the apprehending officers on the first night he came home.
I did have a few problems with the story. One is the script that is a bit haphazard. I think it tries to do too many things, mostly with Allyson's teenage angst and relationships with her peers. Another problem is Dr. Sartin's twist, which does not advance the plot and actually derails it for about ten minutes. The largest problem, thought, was the pace of the Shape. Gone is his pathological patience and stalking which takes away some of the suspense. Instead, he works fast, often killing victims quickly, and killing some that did not help advance the plot. In the original, he killed to set-up a trap, and when he was cornered.
Making up for it, though, is a screenplay that tells a story instead of paying homage as did the misfired H20. Director David Allen Gregory, also has a knack of building suspense and scares without the cheap, distracting jump scares prevalent in the slasher genre. The cinematography is also done well, adding to the suspense of certain scenes. What really shines is Jamie Lee Curtis who shows real acting talent of a woman who can reconcile her fear and determination.
Halloween 2018 is finally the sequel fans like me have wanted. It is far from perfect, although previous sequels were even further from that target. This is the best sequel since The Return of Michael Myers (part 4). If you liked the original, you should like this one.",Halloween

Unlike the original, this movie doesn't have that eerie atmosphere that transcend you to another realm. Some of the shots and dialogue are very similar to the original movie, but it felt more hollow. None of the characters are interesting, they're even dumber than the original movie. One other thing that made the original so good is the simplicity. This movie does have that simplicity but the whole Laurie Strode thing ruins it. And because that's actually the main focus of the movie made it even worse. This movie has absolutely no reason to exist.",Halloween

302,Benslie,A good slasher movie,7,4 November 2018,"First of all, Jamie Lee Curtis did a fantastic job as Laurie. She was able to switch from being a tough character to being more kind and open about what's going on with her. Before I saw this movie I rewatched the original one and it was amazing to see her change from this innocent teenager to a tough woman who would do anything to see the end of Michael Myers. The opening credit sequence to this film was incredible. I wish I could say more about the sequence but it would be borderline spoiler territory so I won't. This movie had some pretty good tension in some scenes as well. Mainly the ending of the film. But no matter what if there was tension or suspense in a scene in this film it was good. As much as this film had some good things about it, it also had some negative things about it. One such thing is the editing in this film. The editing from beginning to end was terrible and all over the place. There were a few scenes where it was okay, but most of those scenes were the suspense scenes. One thing that was great about the first movie was how little you saw Michael Myers which is what him so mysterious but in this one, you saw too much of him. This movie is 1 hour and 44 minutes long and you can feel it. The story isn't interesting unless Laurie is on screen. You don't care about the other characters in this film and just want to see them die. In the end, Halloween (2018) is a good slasher movie but if you want a good slasher and movie then watch the 1978 one.",Halloween
303,saint_brett,Hallowhat?,5,25 October 2018,"I'm sorry Halloween (2018) was that a Silence of the Lambs reference with all the mannequins or 1979's Tourist Trap - which is it? Throw in a bit of The Fugitive and possibly even Law Abiding Citizen then add a shake of Halloween 4, 5 & 8, and a pinch of the Evil Dead cabin and there you have it - Halloween (2018.) Sounds like a case of Dolly Parton's Coat of many Colors all patched together from other sources, right? (Someone's done their homework on set. In theory it looks good on paper to combine every horror movie made before and try to gel it into one.) I also saw two Texas Chainsaw references thrown in there as well near the end! I wish they'd let the whole Myer's storyline die. Carpenter should have picked up from Halloween 3: Season of the Witch and continued with the anthology of other Halloween storylines. The white masked faced killer has been done to death already. It's played out. There's nothing new we haven't seen here before, people! Movie's pointless really? Rebel without a cause ring a bell? The music & score were on point! That hot Bengals chick at the ball was very pretty. And again - they used a few annoying characters you didn't care for and cheered when they were killed off. The killing of the two British journalists at the gas station was brutal and pulled no punches. Was that the lady from 1981's Halloween 2, and her kitchen, he took to with the hammer? That whole ""we're-transferring-him-to-a-new-facility-he-escapes"" business grows tired really fast! Hey - did you not think to sedate him and perhaps place him in a straightjacket before doing so? So, he's locked in Smith's Grove the first time and again he's there for another 40 years a second time - why all of a sudden they decide to ship him off? For what reason? Concerning the whole Dr Sartain storyline - Mr ""So-that's-what-it-feels-like"" the pervert who has a hidden appetite for bloodlust is garbage! (WHAT DROSS!) Here's a responsible state carer, who's no different to Dr Wynn, (who worshipped some satanic Zodiac by the way,) and he secretly wants to know how Myer's ticks? They're almost touching on Halloween 4, 5 & 6 storylines with the Dr Sartain character. My question about movies today is why are they not making iconic characters for today's generation i.e. something new? Instead they're still force-feeding them a diet of what we grew up with in the late 70's and the 1980's. Did you know that there hasn't been not one iconic horror character created since Hannibal Lecter? Not one! (Don't get me started on that Saw rubbish = no class.) I've digressed, my apology. So, Laurie Strode lives way out in the sticks yet can appear in the city in the blink of an eye the next? (That'd be some Grandmother's House clone right there. Yes, another movie rip-off.) And was that her T2 Sarah Connor moment at the start with all the firearms? (Another movie bite?) Did it slip Strode's mind to perhaps move to another state or to the other side of the country maybe? (Oh wait! She already did that in H20 - Myer's must have built-in GPS tracking inside his brain?) Wait a minute! I got it - Laurie Strode & family should move to Hawaii! Solution solves itself. Myer's won't find you there lady, unless he's been building frequent flyer points? I'm sorry Jamie Lee Curtis but you're just not marketable anymore in Hollywood. In my conclusion think about this - Myer's whole killing spree was spurned all because he was offended that his sister had sex with some dude - who lasted no longer than 10 seconds in the sack! So, for the record - Michael Myer's detests premature ejaculation to the point of madness & retribution? Brilliant. A rebel with a cause after all, eh, Mikey?",Halloween
304,Amthermandes,A fine example of how to pander to the true horror fan,10,20 October 2018,"THIS is how you make a horror sequel, or even a sequel in general. Micheal Myers is back, and so is the genius of John Carpenter in this new visual stunner that pay a brilliant homage to the 1978 masterpiece that started this all. Anyone who appreciates good horror should enjoy this, even those who have never seen a Halloween movie. It's got great pacing, and an amazing score. Hardcore violent deaths (without relying entirely on gore to sell the scares), genuine scares (despite some being obvious and predictable), excellent cinematography (I love the slow panning and creepy shots of Micheal). They even knew when to threw in some great humor. It is a great mix of everything that we love in the horror movies we grew up with, all with a modern twist. We even get a glimpse more into the psyche of Micheal Myers. And let's not ignore Jamie Lee Curtis who totally owned it.It is a phenomenal movie, I only wish more horror sequels were like it.Side note: ignore the haters. I read most of the bad reviews here and it's evident they never saw the movie but are just ripping into it for their own malicious reasons. Ignore especially those who claim to be fans of the original. An example would be kylejs-71926, who definitely has never been a fan of horror or Stephen King. Why watch this if you hate horror movies? Losers.",Halloween

306,andrewmerritt-31652,A resurrection to the Halloween franchise,10,27 January 2019,"Halloween is the follow up to the 1978 version of Halloween and has nothing to do with the Halloween movies that Rob Zombie directed way back. Gone is the Rob Zombie's Halloween movies and its replaced by this new Halloween, which is a breath of fresh air for fans of the Halloween movies. There's nothing wrong with the Rob Zombie directing the first two Halloween movies. It just didn't do it any justice and it wasn't what we wanted to see, but in this new one it is resurrected from the dead and we have ourselves a proper remake that we all deserve and still holds up to the 1978 one. This takes place forty years after the first events of Halloween and we see Jamie Lee Curtis is traumatized by what she saw that forty years later she has been preparing for the day that Michael Myers returns. Michael Myers is back and better than ever as his murders get more violent and brutal. This is the most violent I've seen him since any of the other Halloween movies. In the other ones he killed people, but not like this as I start to feel bad for some of his victims for just the way he kills them. And in some weird twisted part of my mind that's buried deep inside, I actually enjoyed it because this is the Michael Myers we've all been waiting for. Sometimes with trying to bring a horror franchise to life it can either be a hit or miss, but in this one was definitely a home run. And that you can tell that everybody was on board with the production of making this happen from the writing to the producing to just about everything I can mention. I could go on and on about Halloween, but I don't want to give any spoilers away, but do yourself a favor if you are a fan of horror movies or if you are a fan of the Halloween movies go see this movie.",Halloween

310,hotrobinproductions,A love letter to the slasher fans (NO SPOILERS),8,14 November 2018,"This film is not only a sequel to the classic carpenter film, not only does it pay its dues to the sequels good and bad that were before it, but this film takes the elements from the other slasher movies to remind us not only why slasher films were great, but why they kept going. Except this film owns it in every way ""SHAPE"" and form. Halloween 1978, who would have thought 40 years from now there would be any hope for a franchise that was intended to end back in 1981? Let alone end on itself because the forced failed sequels. This movie literally goes to the grave yard, digs deep with a shovel, what is it looking for you ask? Well it's looking for every single Halloween film. Not the original. The original is alive and holding better than ever and has been for the past 40 years. This film has that movie written all over of course, after all, it IS ignoring every other movie JUST to have a sequel that FINALLY makes sense. ANYWAYS, it digs all 9 Halloween sequels from the grave, it then learns from its mistakes, studies their flaws, understands it's failures, but then it acknowledges the mark that all the films left on the franchise, this movie then begins to take elements from EVERY sequel to what made them good or at LEAST watchable, and pumps it with adrenaline mixes it in a bowl and adds its own future for it. Don't believe me? See for yourself, AND NO it's not just the EASTER EGGS, there's much more thought embedded to this film at stake than just over hundreds of Easter eggs, there's much more to it than that. This movie somehow manages to find inspiration from the failed sequels, and actually adds a layer to them. For example, Try to envision this, this movie LITERALLY gets inspiration from the wrost film of the franchise HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION. It finds a way to balance its tone from downright laugh out loud hilarious to downright gritty dirty zombie style feel with some awesome over the top kills. Too much to process in your brain? Well what if I told you this film has a scene that has HALLOWEEN: CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS written ALL over it? except it was the WHOLE time and you weren't even expecting it, not even the slightest would you have expected it, but the execution was SO ASTONISHING THAT IT TAKES ALOT TO PROCESS, then the movie flips itself and unlesheas the beauty that made HALLOWEEN: H20 amazing. This film literally follows the original carpenter recipe, but it steals small ingredients that made the failures good and puts them in a bowl to mix them up, then it adds spices of its own take on it, and releases it to the fans for us to eat it up, VWALA, PUMPKIN PIE, a spoon feeder to the fans and a crowd pleaser for the new fans, rating this movie any lower than a 10/10 I would be lying to myself about how much of a genius David Gordon Green is. The film takes off and lands yet another remarkable print into Hollywood, from its classic original, to its 2000 era of horror reboot crave (I'm a fan of zombies 2007 ; not the sequel) to this new era of something much more interesting and special than just a plain ol' reboot. There's so much to say about this film that you probably have already seen, I just wanted to get this main thing out there because I see it's going over ALOT of people's heads. This film is a love letter to the slasher fans, NEW & OLD. When I was somewhat expecting a sequel, I was thinking of the same tone of the original the same simple plot the same low budget etc etc. but when you live in this day and age it's been 40 years, the simple plot line just like that is useless, after 40 years there's so many cliches and things to bump into that you might as well do a reboot like zombie. But This film COMPLETELY EXCEEDED my expectations. It did things I couldn't have even predicted (I ignored trailers & tv spots) it went in a direction I didn't know it was going to and I loved it. Remarkable film with no exception. Will be looking forward to owning it on blu ray.",Halloween

Other than that I was not scared & they made Laurie supposed to be so smart but she made so many stupid decisions for someone planning like 40 years for this night: such as going to your daughters house & just trippin over household security on Halloween night but failing to mention WHY...that she'd just watched the news and the day she's been waiting for for 40 frikin Years is here lmao..so her daughter annoyingly shoves her out the door & she doesn't even try to explain better ....and her granddaughter just dresses up n goes about her night...okkkkkkk they shouldn't even had any kind of warning if they didn't know how to write it!!! And don't get me started on that ending 🙄blowing up her own house and knowing Michael won't die lol just watching him stand there staring instead of SHOOTING him with the many many guns in the bunker she made!! AND don't get me started on that bunker...if you're gna make a freakin hidden bunker in your house planning and plotting for years u could at least do a better job of hiding in it and have a better plan with all those weapons...anyway it seems pretty obvious he survived at the end but it was a weak and annoying ending left u wishing Laurie didn't blow up her own house & wishing they tried harder on this movie it's like they got Jamie lee to sign on again & thought up and idea that really they shoulda allready thought of anyway & said ""good enough this'll make millions at the theatres let's put a half ass effort in now"" great. Oh and it wasn't scary either if anything it was kinda funny in parts tho due to stupidity or shout outs to the first & second Halloweens.

The film fails in many aspects that still has some small things that do work, but not enough to make it good enough.If you don't compare the story to the original: it's very mediocre, that has many moments that are very unoriginal and things that you've seen before, but if you do compare it to the original: it's almost the exact same story, but is less scary than the John Carpenter's classic. There were new things that appear in the film that are just ok and then suddenly something happened that i didn't like. It may be a small spoiler, but i'm not going to reveal what actually happens: there was a moment that they were trying to do something like a twist, but it was just introduced and then the film chooses to not follow it up, so it's forgotten very quickly, so it was pointless. The less can be said for the other aspects that were very weak like the characters; the dialogue; the acting and huge percent of the editing and cinematography, with some things that did work, but are very small positives like some of the music was great; the sound was well done and some shots that looked great.Overall it's just bad, but i still respect the people, who were involved with the making of the film.

314,Kirollos-Noah,Finally!!,7,14 December 2018,"Halloween is directed by David Gordon Green, written by Jeff Fradley, Danny McBride and David Gordon Green, and starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Matichak and James Jude Courtney & Nick Castle as The Shape.Halloween is largely erasing all the disappointing sequels of the original Halloween, and finally they made an equal to the first one.Jamie Lee Curtis returns to her iconic role as Laurie Strode, who comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers, the masked figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago.I went to see this movie and I wasn't excited or putting my hopes on, 'cause after decades of disappointing sequels, I can't be excited, or expecting to see a good movie! But Halloween satisfied me in every way. The intro made me care about Micheal Myers, even more than The Shape himself! Since then I knew that I'm gonna see something special, and I did indeed!I'm a huge fan of the original Halloween movie, beside all of its flaws, it's still one of the best horror movies ever! And I'm a fan of The Shape as well, and what I found through the years were lots of disappointing movies, and two terrible remakes, AND Halloween: Resurrection! But finally I got the chance to see Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode in a very iconic way, and The Shape at its finest performance ever!Halloween isn't perfect though, I have a little flaw with it, and it is killing two people for no reason, maybe the old woman (as we saw in the trailer) because he wanted the knife, but it's very similar to a scene in Halloween II, when he killed an elder woman as well to take her knife, still it was very well directed, as soon as this was about to end, he enters a house to kill a woman for no reason, he just kills her, so this scene is wrong but the music with the amazing direction made this scene entertaining!Because of these two flaws, Halloween isn't perfect, but entertaining, and it did some stuff way better than the first one: the performances, the pacing of the movie which this one was more fast-paced and the breathtaking moments.Halloween is very entertaining, I loved it and I'm gonna give it an A!Alright guys, thank you as always for reading my review, and supporting my stuff.

317,shannen-l-c,A good sequel but not brilliant,6,27 October 2018,"*Contains mild spoilers*Like many of the reviewers here, I am an avid ""Halloween"" fan. It's the film that first made me fall in love with horror and has earned the reputation as one of the best horrors of all time for a reason. There's a lot to live up to when attempting to make a sequel for ""Halloween"" and too many times we've seen others try and fail miserably. I had such high expectations for this sequel because of the hype surrounding it, Jamie Lee Curtis' return and John Carpenter's involvement. However, it just wasn't what I hoped it would be.""Halloween"" (2018) is by no means a terrible film and in comparison to the other sequels in the franchise it is definitely not the worst. There were a lot of nods and references to the 1978 original with the opening credits, music, kills and certain shots which were enjoyable to see. It was also great to see JLC return to the screen as Laurie Strode and her performance didn't disappoint. The performances of the rest of the cast were also generally strong and the cinematography was pleasing. However, this sequel, just like the others, is not without its flaws.As others have pointed out, the film doesn't seem to know what it is. It's a mish mash of genres that clumsily jump around without coherence or consistency. Whilst the beginning starts out strong with two journalists digging into Michael and Laurie's past, that plot is quickly discarded with no follow-up. Then the focus shifts to Laurie and her trauma since the killings of '78, but it never fully commits to it because it feels the need to show us the teenage drama of Laurie's granddaughter's life. Basically, it attempts to do TOO much all at once instead of committing to just one or two central plots/themes and giving them the time and development they needed.One important factor the film was lacking throughout was FEAR. A basic requirement of any horror film is that it's scary, and unfortunately, it wasn't. There were a couple of your typical jump scares that were so predictable that lacked in impact, but besides that there was little of anything. I mostly attribute this to the fact that there was a complete lack of suspense and build-up. The atmosphere was simply not scary and vastly different from the 1978 original whereby the tension was palpable from the get go. But a huge reason why it wasn't as scary as the original was its characterisation of Michael.Michael Myers is one of the infamous killers of all time, but this rendition completely fails to capture the eeriness of his character. In the original his presence is paramount and it strikes fear in the hearts of the audience. The first thing the film gets wrong in regards to this is showing WAY too much of Michael when he is un-masked. Although we never fully see his face and only have shots of him from behind, part of the mystery and fear of Michael's character is that we don't know what he looks like and of course, his infamous mask. Showing us his head of grey hair only serves as a reminder that he's an old man that is far less physically adept and strong as he once was, which immediately reduces the threat he poses. Generally, there also wasn't enough of Michael throughout. There were periods where he was completely absent and in the scenes that he did feature he was just THERE. There was zero build-up, no suspense, no stalking scenes and a complete lack of presence. I can't quite pin-point WHY this is an issue since Nick Castle returned to play Michael, but the entire characterisation of Michael felt off.As for Laurie, brilliant as JLC's performance as Laurie was, her characterisation was just as disappointing as Michael's. Gone is the young, intelligent, charismatic young girl that we rooted for to survive and in her place is a cliche trauma survivor that has took to locking herself away and lives in a constant state of paranoia despite Michael having been locked away for 40 years. The Laurie Strode we saw in ""H20"" (1998) is much closer to the Laurie Strode I wanted to see and that we knew from the 1978 original.Remaining on the subject of characters, there seemed to be too unnecessary characters that disappeared as quickly as they appeared. It was nearly impossible to emotionally connect to any of them (including Laurie, for the most part), because there was no substance and no time taken to develop them so the audience could form an attachment. The addition of Laurie's daughter and granddaughter was something I was looking forward to, but both characters were disappointing, despite great performances from both actresses. Once again, Laurie's son, John (Josh Harnett) from ""H20"" is a much more interesting and likeable character than her daughter in this sequel, Karen (Judy Greer). But by far the worst character was Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer). It was a poor and pathetic attempt to replace the great Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and the sub-plot involving him was out of place and felt like a cheap attempt to surprise the audience and ensure it wasn't following the formula of the original too closely.The last and final area where the sequel falls short are the gaping plot holes which were too many to count. With any horror film the audience has to be willing to let certain things slide because there's always going to be a character making some stupid or illogical decision, such as running up the stairs when they should be running for the door, but it gets to a point where it's very difficult to brush off that kind of idiocy. The circumstances that led Michael back to Haddonfield were created by a bunch of brainless idiots who seemed to regard Michael as a potentially dangerous dog that needed to be kept on a string rather than a violent, psychotic serial killer that needed to be kept behind bars at all cost. Here are just a few questions I left the cinema asking myself: How was such an infamous killer able to escape so easily, particularly when he had previously escaped? What logic was there in transferring him the DAY BEFORE Halloween knowing how significant that day was to him and with minimum security to boot? How did Michael arrive in Haddonfield and just happen to find the exact house that Allyson's friends were at? Basically, the law enforcement from the beginning and throughout were sloppy, lazy and quite frankly, useless. Laurie also made numerous stupid decisions, despite having prepared for Michael's return for 40 years and even Michael himself seemed to lack any kind of strategy or intelligence in his pursuit of his victims.Overall, despite the many negatives of ""Halloween"" (2018) and it's various shortcomings, I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience. There were enough references and similarities to the original for me to enjoy the nostalgia and a good balance between the gore and the plots (despite there being too many sub-plots). Carpenter's musical score alone is also enough to make me giddy with excitement. I will definitley return to watch this sequel again and purchase it when it's released, however, as far as sequels go, I have to admit that I find ""H20"" to be a much better rendition and conclusion to Michael and Laurie's story.",Halloween

I liked it!Laurie is back.. stronger and wiser and tables have turned, she was the victim now she's the hunter!Michael Myers is still a menacing and terrifying character, reprising his beloved mask, great screen presence .. tied in nicely from 1978 movieJamie Lee Curtis is back!",Halloween
319,CaressofSteel75,Cool Sequel- With Much Randomness in the Plot,7,15 January 2019,"If you sat through years and decades of Halloween sequels, remakes & reboots, you'll probably find that this one travels miles above most of the others, even the well constructed Halloween H20.By 2018, Laurie Strode is a personally shattered woman who has spent her whole life preparing for the inevitable return of Michael Myers. Her family is estranged; she drinks, but she's remained single minded in her purpose all these many years. Her character may be somewhat modeled after Sarah Connor from Terminator.There are some good points in this flick that make it worth watching. First, Jamie Lee Curtis owns this movie with her obsessive Michael Myers doomsday prep that's put her at odds with her daughter and grand daughter. A hint of real world conflict comes in briefly when her daughter denies that there's a danger she needs to prepare for and insists that there's a world of love and happiness out there. She's raised her daughter in a house without guns and without security, and we can all tell that worldview is going to get shredded before the end of the movie. You can take a film study moment here to think about whether Michael Myers is now supposed to represent something larger in society.The new doctor is interesting as well. He's obsessed with the Michael Myers case to the point that he finally has to know what it's like to step into the shoes of the killer. As expected, Michael Myers makes his escape from the insane asylum just before Halloween setting up a final showdown at Laurie Strode's fortified country house. It's a good ending with all three generations of the family becoming femme fatales who capture Michael in the basement before setting the house ablaze.There are some problems with this movie- including numerous unexplained coincidences. The ones I noticed:How did the journalists just happen to wind up at the same gas station that Michael Myers was at? That was purely random.The cop and the doctor are driving down the street and sternly say, ""We have to find Michael Myers."" Three seconds later, right on cue, Michael pops up walking down the next street, under a street lamp, bloody butcher knife in hand, waiting to get spotted by the law.And how does Michael Myers find Laurie Strode's house? He just cruises up in a stolen squad car from somewhere like he's got the address plugged into his GPS. (He got through the security gate with no problem as well).And here's another question- what about the black guy in the cowboy hat? He gets introduced into the movie looking like someone who's going to be a factor in the outcome, but then he just disappears. Was his character even necessary?And, as other people have noticed, you're definitely going to see Jamie Lee Curtis shoot from the basement up into the kitchen through what are clearly floorboards, but we see several times that the floor of the kitchen is tile. So, they cut some corners in this one, but they definitely won't spoil this movie for you if you're a fan of the Halloween franchise.",Halloween
320,robinsonaustin-07490,The Year He Returned,8,20 October 2018,"Halloween is the long-awaited sequel to the 1978 horror classic. Ignoring all the movies after the first one, the film is set forty years after the original Haddonfield murders of 1978. Michael is interviewed by podcasters who were doing a documentary about his legendary killing spree, and even acquired his old mask. Meanwhile, Jamie Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, having spent the duration of that time lapse preparing for Michael's inevitable return. However, her obsession with Michael results in her having two divorces and her daughter being taken by child support, thus creating a wedge between her and her estranged daughter. Sure enough, Michael does return, and he is fully intent on continuing his spree.I personally loved the movie. I liked the little nods to the first film, and Jamie Lee Curtis does an excellent job at reprising her role as Laurie Strode. Age hadn't slowed down Myers in the slightest. If anything, he is even worse than he was all those years ago. Nick Castle returns to play ""the Shape"" in the film, being able to project how Michael had coped to forty years of confinement. Upon release, Michael is nothing short of a psychotic beast who goes around killing nearly everything in sight. This harkens back to his original incarnation where he had no real reason for what he did, other than the fact that he was simply pure evil on two legs. The film also continues the trend of the first film of making it unclear as to whether Michael is strictly human, but super strong, or if he was a supernatural force of evil. Because Michael is not related to Laurie in this timeline, it makes Michael's actions worse as because they don't share a familial connection in this film, he killed her friends and tried to murder her for no other reason than he could.As for the other characters, they ranged from being alright to only being there to add to the cannon fodder. Laurie's daughter Karen is interesting as she was practically raised from birth to use guns and other weapons for preparation of Myers' return. This had created a deep wedge between the two as Karen now believed her mother was insane. Her daughter Allyson is tolerable IMO. She is basically your stereotypical teenage girl. For other characters, some were annoying or lacked much characterization. They were only there to be fresh meat for Michael when he resumed his killing spree. There was also Dr. Sartain who served as Michael's new doctor after Dr. Samuel Loomis passed away years ago. Unlike with Loomis, Sartain appeared to be too invested with the Bogeyman. Which makes what transpires later on in the film kind of obvious.
My only real complaints with the film had to be the acting for the most part. Aside from the three main women, most of the acting was cheesy or poorly written. Several scenes also seemed to sporadically jump rather than slowly progress. The ending also felt a little hollow, but that's admittedly more because I anticipated a huge climatic battle between Laurie and Myers.But to be fair, I also felt that the 1978 Halloween wasn't really as great as most movie critics make it out as. For me, some of the acting was corny aside from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence (RIP). The kills were also pretty generic, though to be fair, this is mostly as much as they were able to get away with back then. Myers himself was a terrifying force of evil in that film, but it seemed more that he was limiting himself unlike in the numerous sequels where he only succeeds at amassing a body count of five victims. To be honest, I feel that most film critics had been a little too unfair when reviewing the film because it logically cannot be the same movie as the 1978 one. Why should it? In order for it to catch the same feel the original did would be making an outright remake.Overall, a good film that was worth the wait. Just as long as your expectations weren't blown out of proportion.

321,Schuriken,Very Boring,1,21 October 2018,"Dosed off for like 5 times during this god awful film. I thought it was a drama with Meryl Streep. Then I recalled the opening titles, which read Halloween ? Really ?If Mayers was not in this film at all, it wouldn't make a difference. Adding Mayers to this terrible drama film, still doesn't make it interesting to watch. Or listen to. Or anything.It is a very predictable, boring, uninspiring, storyless, meaningless film. Maybe the old horror masters should just keep their nostalgia to themselves. Carpenter joins Stephen King for the 21st century golden medal awards for boring stories.Did someone say Rob Zombie's Halloween ? Yes sir. Thank you very much Rob Zombie.Note to self : We are dealing with retards. The first movie was called Halloween, The sequel is called Halloween, The remake is called Halloween. Stay calm and don't go crazy cause the Halloween sequel remake to Halloween, will probably call it Halloween. Again. So we wont confuse it with any other Halloween sequels called Halloween.It is not 1978 anymore guys. Move on or stay boring. Very boring.",Halloween
322,ScottDWhalen,"I'll give it a 3 for the ""just a movie"" factor, kills, & acting. The rest WHAT A JOKE!",3,11 December 2018,"I'm sry, but WHAT A JOKE! Ok if we r goin to look at this as ""just a movie"" well the kill scenes were pretty cool acting wasnt bad at all. Yet the ease of Michael Myers just slowing walking to get away is a freaking joke. Not only slowly walking to get away cause well they could have ""time lapsed"" the time it took to get to him cause well ""its a movie"", but there is so many other times that in reality he would have just been a bitch slap away from going down. His death at the end would have been nice to see it actually happen, but how it happened & him just standing there made it kind of silly. Only twist I didn't expect was how the Dr was & what he did that I didn't see that coming. Now if u have some kind of mass murderer in captive like that I think it would be smart IF ur going to keep him alive to put some kind of tracking device DEEP within his body, but noooooooo ""its just a movie"".
When r we going to have someone make a Horror movie thats a bit more realistic to the fact of getting away or not. I know I keep saying it over & over that these movies r a joke yet some will say its cause ur getting older & can realize these things. Good ur right then these ""movie artist"" need to get gooder at making these movies. I've never made a movie & I bet I can do a better job. Lets not be as obvious & start using more misdirection without all the music & sound effects to make it a ""jump scare"". Sometimes I think the actual jump scare that u get within is just the unexpected obnoxious sound effect.
Honestly I think thats y these make believe movies like Marvel & DC r doing a better job cause its easier to accept them knowing they r fake. A serial killer we know is real, but how they go about this in movies is like I said A JOKE!",Halloween

327,benjaminwest-242,A great sequel to revive the franchise,8,25 October 2021,"Halloween (2018) is a perfect way to begin the end of Michael Myers and the long-standing franchise. The character development is great, with a deep performance from Curtis and solid supporting cast that assists in telling the terrifying effect that the boogeyman has had on Haddonfield. This is enhanced throughout the film, as the town realizes he is again free to kill. The overall plot is thrilling, perfectly encapsulating through Myers' actions his psychosis. The fight/kill scenes are well put together and extremely validating to the fear-inducing sound that is all throughout the film. It still isn't clear exactly why Myers is so strong, but the other facets of the original mirrored in the plot are fantastic and add to the spookiness. Overall, a thoughtful addition to the series.",Halloween

Really, I mean, a mental institution allowing a psychotic inmate to be yelled at by an investigative reporter to pick up his killing mask on the 40 year anniversary of the killings? The state of Illinois allows the original killing mask to be borrowed by a reporter? The father saying that he spilled peanut butter on his penis? Transporting a notorious serial killer in a bus with low level offenders? And how did those reporters just happen to run into Myers at that gas station? That black guy with the big cowboy hat? Low brow humor that doesn't work to fill in the holes? The new doctor Loomis wanting to see what it's like to kill people? Myers could have snapped Laurie's throat at least three times but kept playing with her? Laurie so over the top ridiculous she builds an underground bunker under her kitchen? Then she burns her compound to the ground? Was that a victory for her, to burn her house down?

There's some really nice cinematography here, and the atmosphere is quite thick. The characters are believable, except for one or two where the acting is a little weak. Jamie Lee Curtis is pretty cool throughout the entire movie. I also liked how they re-used the old soundtrack, with updated sound quality and sound effects. The gore factor is quite low for a movie of this type, which I actually appreciated even though I am a self-proclaimed gore lover. All in all, a nice round package.",Halloween
331,daryopeek,Passable with cautionary note,6,9 July 2019,"Halloween has been retold for many times with different views. Not only different, almost of each movies with Laurie always end differently, makes Halloween probably the most convenient slasher movie because you can choose the most suitable ending! After the ""nasty"" reimagining by Rob Zombie, I thought the only ways Halloween will be revived, is to make titles like ""Michael Myers in Mars"" or ""Halloween: Stripping Party Continues"", but this movie manages to stay true and live with the screenplay to make this movie stand out from the rest of the series, even though the climax aren't my favorite.What makes Halloween unique is the rapport of the characters that introduced with so much fun. Cheerful dad, stoner friend, and critical kid, are some of the side characters that keep the movie interesting. The plot also a quirky ride due to the unexpected second phase ending, but after that to the ending, it feels so unnatural that all emotion/expectation that end in Laurie Strode x Michael Myers reunion feels too fast and doesn't completing the suspense that has been brought by so many scenes in the beginning.It's sad, because this movie have many chances to increase its value. For example, the chance to finally told something about ""the study of Michael Myers"" instead of blabbering about it like its predecessors or like the drama between Laurie and her daughter which can be more dramatic. All of that showed up because I have no real impression with the deaths showed here. We have collection of brief gore and graphic violence here but those aren't that novel (example: Hatchet) to be the selling point, so what makes this movie really valuable to be watched?For whoever trying to make other Halloween reboot/reimagining/official sequel/remake/rebranding/restyling or whatever re- you trying to do the original movie, please make it smarter and funnier, because even though this movie does its job, it leaves many chances to make this movie a canon for reboot, a thing that Hollywood recently loves.",Halloween

This movie has some very entertaining moments, great film-making, and some downright smart and entertaining call backs to the original.This movie would be fresh and extremely scary if it was the first Halloween movie since the original, but sadly it's not. It's a direct sequel to the original, and it does away with the previous films, but it's still the 11th Halloween movie no matter how hard it tries not to be, which means this movie hasn't done anything we haven't seen before. To put it simply, it's not a horror masterpiece like the original, but it is as good as it could've possibly been.",Halloween
333,gluonpaul,Not nearly as good as the hype suggests but watchable,5,26 October 2018,"So I will actually summarise this right at the top as below I am going to include some serious spoilers about the ending of this movie. First I should mention while I am a horror fan I dont care much for slasher movies so fans of the genre may like it more. In short, most of the movie was fine, jump scares of course which is always a bit lame but it has a decent build up of suspense. Unfortunately it is all let down by a very poor ending to the film. The hype suggests this is a great addition to the halloween series, I would say its adequate, watchable but hardly amazing.MAJOR SPOILERS NOW! You have been warned!Okay so what is good about the movie as mentioned above is the build up of suspense. like the first movie it does this very well with the iconic music and atmosphere all doing their parts. The characters were pretty pathetic and you didnt get a feeling of rounded people especially with the male adolescent characters but hey this is a slasher movie so thats not as important as the atmos and kills which were both well done.Unfortunately all of that was let down by a really unsatisfactory ending to the whole thing. Basically the whole movie has been building on the basis of everybody trying to understand why Myers is the way he is, why does he kill. The movie does a good job of showing us actually from his perspective he just doesnt care, he just likes to kill when he gets the chance. Thats a pretty scary concept which is great for the movie.The movie also spends a lot of time building up Jamie Lee Curtis character (Laurie Strode) as having been mentally scarred and desperate to get revenge on Myers. Again very believable and alot of that helps to build suspense.Then it gets to the ending, basically this ""I dont care who I kill"" machine is brought by the doctor who was studying him to Strodes house which she has been building into a fortress for her whole life to deliberately create a final showdown. Very lazy plot writing there.The Myers breaks into her house, which for some reason she has filled with dummies which look like people to scare the s*** out of herself as she turns corners? If you were worried about a crazed serial killer breaking in for 40 years would you do that? Started to get very boring at that point.Then after some running around there is a ""twist"" ending where the women of the Stroud family trap Myers in the cellar and burn him to death, because this fortress was actually a trap. Okay..... I guess?I think the ending would have made much more sense if either Myers literally just ignored the Strouds altogether while they spent their entire lives looking for revenge and could have ended with him just walking to the next town to carry on killing. Or perhaps Curtis character could have started killing people who were in her way to get to Myers because her desire for revenge was so strong and in the end she goes nuts and becomes a killer herself. All in all pretty much anything but the cliched ending we got would have been better.Still most of the movie was pretty decent for a slasher flick so I guess just sigh at the ending and enjoy the rest.",Halloween

337,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,A triumph in hommage,7,3 November 2018,"We have witnessed much of the classic movies receive sequels as of late. Blade runner, Star Wars, Jumanji, Predator are just some of the most recent examples. Halloween follows that trend and exceeds in every possible way.The most important thing to know about this movie is that it is a sequel, but it is also a kind of remake/reboot of the franchise. Halloween has turned into a comedic and laughable franchise turning Myers into nothing more than a cliche of what he actually was. For years, the Halloween movies degraded into total chaos and every sequel that was released was worst than the previous one. In all fairness, Zombie's rendition (but only of the first movie) was decent but lacked the necessary spookiness the original had. And so we come to this, in lack of a better word, masterpiece.Halloween 2018 completely disregards every prior movie and sequel after the original (doing rightfully so) and continues 40 years after the ending of the original. It succeeded in rewriting and changing everything we know and come to expect from a Halloween movie. And after 40 years, that says a lot.The acting. Curtis returns to her iconic role and creates something perfectly new and fresh. She created a good blend of Sarah Connor toughness and the original Laurie Strode. That not only gave the audience a new insight into the already known character, but presented us with a totally new character. The position Curtis found herself in was not easy, but she delivered with style. Unfortunately, there were not so many scenes where she could have shown all of her new traits, but the ones where she had, she used perfectly. It was just a joy to watch her after all these years play the same heroin in a completely different way. Greer was her usual self. There really was nothing so special about her character or performance except for the finale where she provided the audience with a great twist in her character. A shame because her character had a lot more to give and was given a lot more time to shine. Matichak on the other hand was good enough for the role she was given. Unfortunately, having to deal with the likes of Curtis and Greer put her a little on the margins but she actually did quite a decent job. Their trinity against the Shape not only makes for a great viewing experience but it provides the viewers with strong and independent women against pure evil (and that is done much better than most of the movies these days). The rest of the cast were forgettable, as they were supposed to be. But the one thing this movie does splendidly is the portrayal of The Shape. It is hauntingly scary and disturbing, and we have not seen it this intimidating since the original movie. Congratulations for returning it to its original form and formidability.The script was decent enough, nothing extravagant or flamboyant. It kept to the original form, using only simple and basic plot lines. This movie actually learned from the original and keeps the original form - simplicity. That is what worked 40 years ago, and that is what works now (interestingly enough).The overall direction/editing and music. This movie functions from its first to its last scene without a hitch. The way the movie progressed and how the story builds up to the climactic finale is just phenomenal. It actually uses the tension and the slow burning first part to keep the audience on the edge of their seats just to literally explode in the final act. The final confrontation is nerve ripping, it is tense, it leaves you wanting more and more, and the movie gives you even more than you wanted. One cannot help but feel grateful for that approach and almost forgets the movie drags on a bit in the middle (there are some editing problems visible at the 2/3 of the movie). But, one of the most intense elements of the movie is the music. Carpenter outdid himself (again), using very familiar tunes, and adding a new layer to them, a new tempo, but still keeping it all very, very simple. This movie is the prototype of less is more technique.All in all, Halloween 2018 is a movie made as a redemption for 40 years of terrible Halloween movie sequels. It is also a reboot/remake of the franchise. It created a new storyline, opened up new ground for discovering new plot lines and further exploring new characters. Is it a lot? Yes it is, but Halloween does it all. It is a movie made with so much love and respect that one just has to admire it. Learn from it, respect it and really, see this movie as often as you can. It is the best horror/thriller movie made in decades.",Halloween
338,rustonreviews,A somewhat empty return for the slasher icon.,5,1 November 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece Halloween is a staple of horror cinema. Carpenter's film introduced cinemagoers to Michael Myers (AKA The Shape) and spawned one of horror cinemas most popular ongoing franchises. The original Halloween is a simple, low budget slasher film that relied more on atmosphere and suspense rather than excessive gore and remains one of the greatest horror classics. It's sequels Halloween II (1981) and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998) form a cohesive, solid trilogy that conclude perfectly in H20's terrific finale, providing a definitive ending to the conflict between Myers and Laurie Strode (Curtis). Of course, there are a variety of crummy sequels taking place in between Halloween II and H20, with the worst offender being Halloween: Resurrection (2002); a truly terrible, awful, and shameful film that wrongly decided to follow on from H20 in the worst way possible, resulting in the franchise being killed stone dead until Rob Zombie's troublesome remake attempted (and failed) to breathe new life into a fading icon.Fast forward to 2018, and every sequel taking place after original film has been stricken from canon to make way for this new instalment, marketed as the ""true sequel"" to Carpenter's original classic. Forty years have passed since the night he came home, and Laurie Strode is plagued with PTSD and haunted by the possibility of Myers dreaded return. She has spent her life preparing for one final confrontation, resulting in two failed marriages and the alienation of her daughter Karen (Greer). After Myers transport bus crashes, he escapes (as do all the other asylum inmates) and he returns to Haddonfield, intending to finish what he originally started forty years ago.Jamie Lee Curtis is once again fantastic as Laurie Strode and is undoubtably the films strongest factor. Curtis delivers a performance that manages to find the perfect balance between devastating frailty and remarkable courage, and it's a shame she doesn't feature in the film as much as we were promised. John Carpenter returns to compose a stunning new score and resurrects his iconic theme to accompany the opening credits that pay a perfect homage to his original film. I was hooked during the films first act and marvelled at Michael Myers glorious return in a chilling sequence that ranks as one of the very best in the entire franchise. And it's such a shame, because it's all downhill from there. I went into Halloween with very high expectations and left disappointed, as everything completely falls apart after the impressive first half hour.The problem with 2018's Halloween is that it feels completely unnecessary. When creators make the bold decision to erase years' worth of canon, I expect it to be because they have a story that warrants that creative decision. Unfortunately, erasing H20's perfect ending wasn't worth it, because this film fails to provide a definitive conclusion to the conflict between Laurie and Myers. Tonally, the film is all over the place and does a poor job of balancing the gruesome brutality with moments of out of place humour. An unusual amount of time is dedicated to Laurie's uninteresting granddaughter and her even less interesting friends at a school party/rave, whereas this time should have instead focused on Laurie herself. Characters are introduced solely to be killed by Myers, and this would have been perfectly acceptable had they been in anyway related to Laurie. Because they are not, however, it simply becomes gratuitous and rather pointless to spend time with disposable characters purely to show us a bloody kill or two. A new psychiatrist is introduced to replace Dr. Loomis, who was portrayed excellently by Donald Pleasence throughout most of the franchise. Dr. Ranbir Sartain (Haluk Bilginer), blatantly deemed the ""new Loomis"" by Laurie, fails to match the importance of Dr. Loomis and feels like dead weight in every scene he is in. What the filmmakers should have realised right off the bat is that you can't replace Donald Pleasence, so they never should have even attempted to do so.Halloween is a disappointing, lacklustre affair. Whereas H20 felt like a true ending to the franchise, this ""true sequel"" reeks more like a blatant cash grab than it does a passion project for all those involved. It's a mostly by the number's slasher, with more focus pointed towards dull teens getting murdered instead of the trauma of Laurie Strode and the damage it has done to her life. Ultimately, the film doesn't feel focused enough to earn its title as the ""true sequel"" to Carpenter's original. Although it gets certain things right (Myers has never looked more menacing) it also gets a whole lot wrong, resulting in a forgettable slasher. For me, the story of Michael Myers ended with H20, and there's not a thing anyone can say to convince me otherwise.",Halloween
339,JoshuaDysart,Lacks the exciting simplicity of the original.,7,29 October 2018,"This is the eleventh ""Halloween"" film. It means well and is mostly fun. It features some strong kills, decent payoffs, and well photographed and put together set pieces. I think David Gordon Green (big fan of ""Prince Avalanche"") is an excellent director. It's wonderful to see an older woman leading a horror film, twice as wonderful that the woman is Jamie Lee Curtis. But the newest ""Halloween"", like all of the sequels, doesn't seem to understand that the spirit of the original is in its simplicity.So this time around we see THE SHAPE kill far more people, we visit far more locations, we're introduced to more characters (although having three generations of Survivor Girls is cool), we get more backstories... but we lose the straight shot of suspense that defined the original.The stalking, the hunting, the silence, all of that is gone in favor of ramped up violence, more random kills, and less tension building. The new film is less horror/suspense and more action/horror. I assume this is the case for two reasons:1. Carpenter's simplicity is incredibly difficult.
2. Sequels always come with story baggage.I think there was a much more interesting and subtle take on Laurie Strode PTSD that would have gotten us to the same ending, elicited the same emotion, and given this great actress a lot more range to work with.However we do get some star making turns from Andi Matichak, Miles Robbins, and Jibrail Nantambu.This is not ""Halloween"". It's ""Halloween"" fan fiction. It's not the worst of the sequels, but its still just ""Halloween"" in name only.PS: And that cold open... just awful. That's what ""working too hard"" looks like.",Halloween

341,kevinoreilly-47281,This movie was created by federal mandate.,3,30 July 2019,"Halloween 2018 pretends to disregard the sequels yet depends on them entirely to carry its pathetic plot. Laurie barracades herself for 40 years from a man who killed five, count 'em, FIVE people and had been locked up for 40 years. This movie was forced in to conception by the powers that be to water down our perceptions of horror and counteract the heinous backfire of society that the feds/""powers that be"" created. Our society then and now is scarier than this film and it was never intended to be albeit constructed by our government, and this movie is a disgusting and pathetic attempt at reverse propoganda. Its too late to reverse what you created uncle sam. Your lack of imagination has finally caught up to you. You're disgusting. All that being said, this IS the worst horror movie ever made, an absolute disgrace and makes no sense. It might be the worst movie of any genre ever made. In fact, I do believe it is................",Halloween
342,kira02bit,"Despite the rave reviews, there are things that work and things that don't",6,8 November 2020,"Much like Friday the 13th, Halloween seems to be a franchise that will not die and keeps rebooting itself in various ways. John Carpenter's original, which premiered in 1978, and introduced the world to both the unstoppable Michael Myers and the now legendary Jamie Lee Curtis, is a classic for good reason. Watching it now decades later, one can still marvel over the mood, the atmosphere, the creepiness and the genuine investment that one has with the characters on the screen.Alas, the myriad sequels seemed completely at sea as to what made the original so memorable and compelling. Halloween II degenerated into an assembly line gorefest with Curtis given the thankless task of being drugged into a stupor for its running time. Halloween III did not even have any relation to the prior films. The subsequent Halloweens 4 through 3000 are complete trash, including the misguided remakes from Rod Zombie. Curtis was coaxed out of retirement from the franchise in 1998 for a 20 years sequel, which boasts a terrific cast, her great lead performance and enough charm, atmosphere and clever touches to bring it the closest to the original. It also treated films 3 onward as though they never existed (not a bad idea). Alas H20 was followed by one of the more rubbishy sequels.Now we get this latest effort, which again erases the timeline from the end of the original film onward and starts over. This film now tells us that Michael was caught just a few blocks away after being shot by Dr. Loomis and was returned to his institution ever since. Surviving victim Curtis has dealt with PTSD and stress by living in seclusion, training for the day when she knows Michael will escape, and turning her property into a booby trap. Naturally, while being transported with his latest psychiatrist (Hiluk Bilginer) and a few other patients, the bus has an accident and Michael is on his way to Haddonfield to wreak havoc.There are a number of things that work here and a number that misfire, which makes some of the feverish raves from critics that should know better puzzling. Obviously the film's best asset is Curtis, who turns in a multi-faceted and fascinating turn as Laurie. Laurie is looked on by others with a mixture of pity and annoyance with her almost single-minded obsession with protection. She is tough and unyielding, but definitely loves her semi-estranged daughter Judy Greer and granddaughter Andi Matichak.Given that this picks up after the original Halloween, this means that the hoary old cliche of Laurie being Myers' sister is mercifully scrapped. Unfortunately, the screenplay is juggling too many balls. We have Michael's escape and reign of terror, the psychiatrist teaming with the local sheriff Will Patton to find him, Laurie's story, Greer's reluctance to be drawn into her mother's world again, and Matichak's subplot on hanging out with her friends unaware of the hell about to break loose. This does not leave an abundance of time to spend on much. Whereas in the first Halloween, we got to know the potential victims well before Michael had his spree. Here, we have been barely introduced to them before they are killed, so the kills have limited impact. And given that Myers has no reason to focus in on Matichak or her friends, it seems a striking coincidence that he just happens to land on them.Director David Gordon Green lacks John Carpenter's ability to convey atmosphere or tension. For all of the success achieved with the main role, the film is just not scary. There is one adequate sequence with a security light and Michael edging closer to a victim, but otherwise not much else. There are too many scenes of Michael robotically marching into stranger's homes and murdering them in plain sight with no build-up. It is dull rather than scary.Ditto, the whole subplot about Myers and his oddball psychiatrist should have been scrapped. Bilginer seems a weirdo from the start, so his actions later in the film are less surprising than a foregone conclusion. We hope the film is not going there, but it does. Then again, Myers has no reason to end up at Laurie's booby-trapped home for the climax, so the script needs to conspire contrivances to make it happen.While Curtis carries much of the burden of the film, Greer is also strong, if strangely underused. Matichak also does well and Patton is solid as the sheriff. The less said about Bilginer, the better. The Strode women definitely have men issues. We never know anything about Laurie's former spouses, but Matichak is stuck with the charmless weedy Dylan Arnold, who somehow escapes the action by being a two-faced snot. Worst casting is definitely Toby Huss as Greer's husband. Although only a bit older than Greer he looks and acts like he would be better suited playing her dad. At first we think the character is comic relief, but then it becomes apparent it is sketchy writing and bad acting. We cannot believe for one moment that Greer would be married to him or that he spawned Matichak. His character is a complete irredeemable moron and it says something that when he and Michael predictably cross paths and tragedy strikes that literally no one in the film gives him a moment's thought.The climax is pretty well done and elevates the film. Curtis, Greer and Matichak all handle themselves admirably and it is interesting watching their changing dynamics in these moments. Of course, these are the three characters we are invested in, so there is the rooting interest missing earlier in the film when Michael meanders around town offing unknowns. Still, I really miss the creepiness of the original film which is no where to be found here. Truthfully, I think H20 gave Curtis a strong showcase as well and worked better than what plays out here. Naturally, the ending leaves room for the inevitable sequel(s).",Halloween
343,drahulrajjsd,The Best Halloween Sequel Ever!!!,10,25 October 2018,"The new Halloween movie is a direct sequel to the original 1978 Halloween and it's the best Halloween sequel ever. Badass performances from both the legendary Nick Castle, who reprised his role as Michael Myers and James Jude Courtney who portrayed Myers as well. The one who not only reprised her role, but also stole the entire show in my opinion, is the lead actress, the one and only, the iconic Jamie Lee Curtis! She is just a total badass granny! Believe it or not, as a horror fan, this is my very first time seeing Michael Myers slashing on the big screen and I really enjoyed every second of it! Great kills! Great soundtrack!

Its basically H20 all over again but because Jamie Lee Curtis is in this one it instantly makes it a good movie. It wasn't original, it wasn't scary like the rest were. This whole sister/brother angle has gone on for far too long and has made the franchise stupid. It was better when it was just a murderer out for revenge on a town that wronged him.The characters are stupid and it feels more like another women empowerment movie than anything. Michael Myers doesn't even feel like a villain anymore in this but more a joke. The writing for the plot itself makes close to no freaking sense.Yet the fanbase just claim its a masterpiece and anyone who disagrees to open their eyes to this lower than mediocre film is bashed on by the entire planet it seems like. Its not nearly as good as you people think it is if you'd open your eyes for two minutes and rewatched the original halloween/2 and even rob zombie's looks better than this.",Halloween
349,asd29,"Better than all the other sequels but the film falls flat in intervals , and feels a bit contrived.",6,27 April 2019,"The opening of the movie is very eerie and the music and setting help the scene, when two podcast investigators visit an aged and derranged michael myers at smyths grove where he has been incacarated for 4 decades , they try to talk to michael but as usual he is dormant , only an evil side way glance when his old shatner mask is held in the air with onlooking patients freaking out provoking the serial killers escape , the begining of the movie sets up the tone of the film , but apart from the ending been quite entertaining the middle part goes of the mark with meaningless subplots that just seem boring and dont seem to blend in with the tone at all , the murders are cold and grisly and the content is quite graphic ,the acting by jamie lee curtis playing an old laurie strode is on par in this , its believable and moving , whilst other cast members arent as engaging.
Jude courtney does an excellent job as myers ,putting in a creepy and viscious performance which is more relentless than the killing spree in 1978. the other issues i have with the movie are : how was myers captured in 1978? i think it would be a lot creepier him giving himself up, going into a trance like the little myers did in the original , him been captured contradicts his invincibility at the end of the first movie , what did they do ? Hit him with a missile? that feels a bit out of character the shape is supposed to be supernatural and elusive, and also the probability of myers escaping from the asylum and just happens to bump into the podcasters to murder them to get his shatner mask back..........
AGAIN ON HALOWEEN NIGHT mmmmmmm 😥 6.5 - is loyal to the original and the beginning and ending scenes bring entertainment value , but the franchise was tired years ago, this movie is just an above average reboot sequel to the original which delivers little more.",Halloween

It was nice to see an attempt at a classic revisiting of the characters. and though there wasn't much depth, the imagination could fill in some of the pieces. Nostalgia was there ham-fistedly. Callbacks to original scenes. There was a few familiar musical cues and tracking shots. Michael Myers was in top form savagery, one thing they at least did well. The mask hasn't looked this good since the original. The deaths and prosthetics all had an oldschool feel to them. The kills were both relentless and somehow still restrained in not showing too much. There was even off screen deaths...if you're in to that kind of thing. Good mask. Nostalgia. Beat by beat callbacks.",Halloween
351,Ingrouille181,"If you want the true Halloween sequel, it's not this one",5,21 October 2018,"Hopefully this will stay up long enough before the Blumhouse money grabbers.....I mean the producers have it taken down. I wanted this to be the definitive sequel, the definitive end to Michael Myers and the Halloween franchise, I mean until they reboot it in a few years (💵). SPOILERS for the end, Michael's trapped in the house at the end and it gets burned down with him in it, but we don't see him die, so unlike the true Halloween sequel, the second one, HALLOWEEN II!, it's been left open for a sequel, because why not.This film picks up 40 years after the original, where Michael has been captured and has been living in a mental asylum. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode has been preparing herself for a reunion with 'The Shape', all the while dealing with family drama.The movie is half contrived and half pointless arcs to pad the runtime. A lot of things happen in the movie just to get characters from A to B, and some of them have no explanation whatsoever. The original movie made a point to tell us that Michael is possessed by evil. But I didn't understand his motives. We know that he wants to kill Laurie and her family; why he goes after Laurie's granddaughters friend at a completely random house I don't know. Is he just going on a random killing spree or are the people and houses he goes to connected to Laurie? Film doesn't tell us. The films meant to be a slasher so we have to have some random people get butchered, I guess. Also, the New Dr. Loomis' storyline is so silly; he's there to ask why Michael's the way he is, which was already dealt with in the original: HE'S POSSESSED BY EVIL. Does the audience really care about this psychology subplot? I mean we don't go to see a Star Wars movie to learn about Astronomy. I swear around this point in the movie I could hear several people snoring. We get several homages, or winks to the original, but unlike the Rob Zombie remake, they work themselves into the plot of the film and make it ridiculous to see. We also have the dumb teenage characters, and almost every single one I thought would die did die. I guess the whole babysitter friend murder scene happened, because it happened in the original? Another spoiler, even though you saw it in the trailer anyway.Also like I said, things happen in this movie just to get characters where they need to go, specifically michael. And even though him being possessed by evil is a neat way to explain a lot things, like how he's able to drive, by a point it starts coming off like someone asking why someone didn't bring your homework and them saying their dog ate it. Watch the movie, and you'll get what I mean.I really liked Laurie Strode in this, and it makes her 40 year old PTSD believable, and I like how it messed her up to the point that she's become detached from her daughter and her family. The gore is what a lot of people come for and it doesn't disappoint.I would have also liked several other inmates to have escaped with Michael, maybe it could have been a race to find the real one or something like that. Literally doesn't go anywhere. I didn't hate this movie: Blumhouse has shown to be a competent company, but too much dumb s$\t made its way into the script. Even though Halloween II has dumb stuff in it too, at least it's a definitive sequel, and keeps Michael dead. If Halloween II isn't your bag for the definitive sequel, there's also Halloween H20, give that a see.I'm giving this a 6 out of 10.",Halloween
352,nitestar95,"If you liked Blair Witch, you'll probably love this.",2,22 October 2018,"Like BW, this is a completely unrealistic movie, nothing like the original, which puts the audience in an experience that they all know could actually happen (other than the ending, of course). It seems every character is incredibly stupid. Maybe if you are, too, you'll think their behavior is appropriate and normal for the situation that they are in. I certainly did not. Sure, most movies have some hard to believe scenes, but this movie is loaded with them. This one starts off with moronic behavior that supposedly takes place in a hospital, but simply can't. No hospital would allow a couple of journalists to enter and then start yelling at the patients. So it's not scary, because we are kept getting perpetual reminders of things that wouldn't happen in reality. This is like watching people flapping their arms and wind up flying. It's that ridiculous. I won't go into all the other outrageous things that happen to avoid spoilers. But I'd advise anyone who's intending to go see this in a theater, to wait until it comes out on tv or video, and not waste your money this Halloween season, just because they stuck the 'Halloween' tag on this one. Go watch 'Ghostwatch' or 'The Entity' for some old time scary stuff. Both on youtube for free.",Halloween

355,ranblackman,Character developed serviceable movie.,8,28 May 2019,"I liked it, it was good. I, however, was not to blown away buy it. Rather this is my own fault for allowing myself to become too far gone in bearing the burden of expectation is a possibility. Nonetheless, it is a good movie.First off is the acting. Especially coming from Jamie Lee Curtis. She is as amazing as Laurie, though quite different. Here she is old, grizzled, damaged. Myers has taken over most of her life, leading her to lose things. Her family, having sort of driven them away with her training tactics. When Myers finally does return, she has been prepared for years. The other actors are all good, yet mostly serviceable. The music also is good, having a lot of callbacks to the original, this also goes into the plot, though both know their limits and bring their own material that is well welcomed, though even still not special. The gore, impressive. Hard R horror is still back and going strong.The problems with this movie come down to it being a little ordinary. Aside from all the serviceability, we have to sit through a lot of fake out jump scares, which are the source of a lot of the faults in many modern horror films. There are even some things that don't make any sense at all. There is a twist of a sort, though I'm not sure even if that's what it is since it is immediately tossed out, thus all together pointless. The kills as well, all forget-able, despite the gore.This is still hot a bad movie. In the end, it really is Curtis who makes it. Her developed story, her character's motivation, is the heart, are what drives it. Everything else is still perfectly good, still watchable. It is her that really carries it and makes it a good movie with a reason to exist, taking an already iconic character, and developing her to a different level. That's how I see it and why it works.",Halloween

358,botrytis,This is by far the best of them all,8,8 September 2020,"We did a Halloween marathon this week watching all installment ever put out within the franchise; which are 11 movies. Gotta say that everything beyond Carpenter's Halloween all of them are pretty much pointless to see, but I'm glad I saw them because now I know that there is really nothing better than these two movies, the 1978 and 2018 one.Carpenter's Halloween hasn't aged well, it might be even considered a weak horror movie for today's generations, including me, but I can see why it might have been a big hit back in the days. It has good cinematography, good craftsmanship behind it with artistic affinity and having POV with the killer itself is a disturbing concept no matter the age we live in, but most importantly... it has a specific tone, feeling to it that just gives it a unique charm.And that charm was well transferred to this Halloween movie. It really captures all that specific tone Carpenter's Halloween had and the narrative itself is paced quite perfectly that makes this whole 1 hour 45 minutes runtime just past quickly. It is definitely a satisfying film for anyone that just wants to see THE Halloween spirit... again. Actually, compared to all the trash that came after the first ever movie in the franchise this might be even the best one among them all, and the only one that matters.So, from a guy who watched all the Halloween movies I can say this is the only one you need to see after the Carpenter one. If you want to know what those 9 other movies are all about just watch some video summary on youtube... that's my honest advice on this matter.Long story short: This and the 1978 one are the only Halloweens that should exist, and for me they do.",Halloween

This film was on-task. They don't show as many in-the-moment death scenes(which flowed with the plot because it's all about the story, not all the deaths) and had a very old yet amusing score, setting the neutral boundary between the pass or fright side, making you feel what Laurie feels every step of the way. You can feel paranoia, tragedy, and loosening up. What's different from the first film is that it's not about really defending as much as yourself but the ones you love which sticks out away from the first film.The story clicked but the beginning was too thick. The beginning act focused too much on side characters. They could've used those side characters for a greater purpose but instead were sorta left in the dust. Now the comedic sides of things were some of the positive aspects of this film but I feel like they should've been toned down a little more, also Laurie's granddaughter needs to shed more backstory and why she's so important to Laurie because we don't actually know alot about her aside from that she's Laurie's granddaughter and that Laurie cares for her.I feel this is a fantastic thriller with bite and tone but, like every movie, isn't perfect.Minimal F-words(one sexualized), semi-gore, super brief nudity",Halloween
367,darryl-jason,🎃 Halloween: 40 Years & Now,7,18 November 2018,"Jamie Lee Curtis has credited this movie as living up to the original & it certainly does that. I think some reviewers here have judged the film afterseeing the trailer. Yes sometimes the trailers often give us a better effect & more of an insight. I'm quite satisfied with both, having seen the trailer & now seeing the movie I do quite like it. However, saying that there's a few pro's & con's when it comes to this sequel...Firstly, I think this movie would have worked much better had it followed on from Halloween H20"" (1998) which co-starred Josh Hartnett as Laurie's son. & the way that film ended with the infamous decapitilisation at the end, if that didn't finish Michael Myers off for good then why would we think anything in this 2018 sequel would be the final ending? Or is it?Back to this sequel; I do like how the producers have kept to the original idea from ""H20"", with the famous bathroom scene, when the reporter uses the public toilets & surprise surprise Michael suddenly wonders in, but why is there never anyone else in public toilets when there's a defenceless woman in there alone with a killer?
You'll also notice following on from this scene that at exactly 40 minutes into the film, Michael discovers his one true possession... his mask! Coincidence?The blonde babysitter - only a true blonde would run upstairs instead of going out the front door but this isn't what happens; we're surprised with the comedic stupidity of her ""accidentally"" tripping over her own feet as she runs out of the bedroom to escape Myers. Ofcourse she has to wear socks but if she didn't we wouldn't be witnessing any reason for her to trip & fall....Then there's the hidden trap door in the kitchen, I like this but as we already know Michael has a smart mind & as one of the other reviewers have posted a similar comment, why would someone hide down in a hidden trap door basement only to scream & make noise to attract attention of a killer lurking around the house?Jamie Lee Curtis did a fine job as Laurie Strode once again but I just felt her character could have done a lot more. When we watch ""Halloween: H20"" (1998), Laurie carries such determination to kill Michael Myers, she goes after him with axes, she fights & fights to give Michael what he deserves & we also see this in the new sequel it just seems Laurie is now a little weaker than ever. Maybe that's just my observation. I could be wrong. But yes she's gone for the Sarah Connor from T2 look here.We are also treated with John Carpenter's famous Halloween score. Fantastic & true to the original, I just would have loved more consistency of hearing this throughout the movie, it would have added that little bit more suspense.There's one unanswered question when you put all these Halloween films together; what will it take to kill Michael Myers ? Depcapitilisation, gunshots through the heart, knife-stabbing, burned alive? It's all been shown to proven nothing has worked.
Maybe there is one more story to tell... & as we know all stories come to an end.",Halloween

they had t reshoot it since the original was even worse. But it's made a ton of money so expect a sequel soon. This wasn't needed and was pretty dull.",Halloween

I have seen every Halloween movie and this, by far, is the best. Halloween sequels have made a game out formulating these films and making them trivial and derivative. This one takes it in new directions that are admittedly similar to Halloween H2O but does them SO much better. Not only do we have the traditional Michael Myers stuff but we also have the super talented Jamie Lee Curtis back bringing the breath of fresh air this series desperately needed. Halloween is back and I hope if they create more sequels that they try to make them the same way they did this one. NO MORE POINTLESS SEQUELS! Jamie Lee Curtis is the standout and Judy Greer is a great addition to the cast. The stuff with the grand-daughter can get a bit annoying but they don't ever stay on her for too long. There is a twist in the middle-end of the movie that might divide fans but at least it decided to take some risks. I hope more horror sequels take note.",Halloween

This is the sequel we deserve. After the original Halloween I only like two more movies, Halloween II and H20.

So proud of this movie!",Halloween
379,jchano123,Product made to make money that clearly succeeded,2,31 October 2018,"Nothing in this works. At all. This is the exact reason I gave up on modern horror films. The dialogue is laughably bad and makes for completely flat and terribly unlikeable characters. Theres also some of the poorest attempts at comic relief in a film that I have ever seen. I audibly groaned at nearly all of them. It doesn't help that the acting and delivery of the dialogue couldn't have been worse. I had to keep from screaming at the characters.
The music was placed at the absolute worst times - not only the theme music, but the jump scares. When trying to follow up a classic like the original Halloween and retconning everything else, you have to bring at least SOMETHING to the table. In the original, the jump scares were minimal and were purposeful. Not only that, but so much of this movie is rehashing scenes from the original in the most blatant and ham-fisted way possible. Some scenes were identical for no reason other than to remind the audience of the original.
It lacks any kind of energy or tension, mainly due to the predicable and overuse of jump scares, as mentioned. Even the 2007 remake had SOME energy, and at least Resurrection was a little laughable. This had absolutely nothing - no likable characters, no innovative directing, no memorable imagery, no interesting locations - nothing.
How about the ending of this? Almost identical to that of Halloween II, but it's supposed to be ok since this retconned it and is supposed to replace it, right? No, it still exists, and we have to acknowledge that.I hate Jason Blum so much. So much of the runtime has nothing to do with Myers, it's clear that this film was a product made to make money and cash in on the franchise, and clearly the goal was accomplished, seeing as how it's currently made $174.5 million at the box office on a budget of $10-15 mil.
I rarely ever give anything such a low rating, but I really tried to grasp anything at all to appreciate here, and there was no possible way it could have been any worse. I pride myself on being hypercritical to every aspect of a given film and not just giving 1 star because I got bored or didn't absolutely love it, like I see some people do. This one was actually that bad. Skip this, the 1981 sequel is far superior and miles more satisfying.",Halloween

381,ivo_shandor,The best one since the first,7,28 September 2020,"Since Halloween is very close, let's take a look back at the latest Michael Myers film. It's called Halloween, aka Halloween 2, aka the other Halloween 2, not to be confused with the other Halloween 2, is the last film in the Halloween franchise, at least it should have been. Despite it's awkward title, it's technically the best film since the first one in 1978. It does have some weird scenes for comedy effect, which is surprising that the film is directed by someone most known for comedy. There's a long single take shot which I absolutely love, and Myers is treated as scary and as an actual threat compared to the sequels. It could have used some more murders, and some more elaborate ones at that. The one thing about the film is that it made me immediately tired, tired of Halloween films and tired of the franchise. It would have been the better book end to the series, but we're getting more, always more. It made me sick of all the films, and you feel like you just want it to end. It has a great ending, but a dumb twist. Despite some weird scenes and missed opportunities, it's actually pretty good as far as reboots go. I'm not lying when I saw it's the best Halloween film since the first one, this one is more fresh in my mind and it captures the feeling of the original film. The music is great, because it's actually done by John Carpenter himself, and he seemed like he had good input on this one. If you want a good Halloween movie, listen to John Carpenter. Seeing any new films would just make me feel exhausted and tired, like going to a job you don't care about anymore. I've no doubt the sequels would be better than the others, but let's please stop. Myers had a good run, but now it's time to let the franchise disappear. I just want John Carpenter to make a sequel to Big Trouble in Little China.",Halloween

388,ChristianLeFeuvre,Not as good as I'd hoped,3,28 October 2019,"Halloween was directed by David Gordon Green, and Jamie Lee Curtis is back reprising her role as Laurie Strode
This is officially the sequel to the original 1978 'Halloween' directed by John Carpenter. This film dismisses every other 'Halloween' movie, so 'Halloween II' never happened, 'Halloween H20' never happened etc.
This film sees the grown Michael Myers being transferred to a new facility, but the bus crashes allowing Myers and the other patients to escape.
Laurie Strode has been preparing for this night for the last 40 years and has a hidden cache of weapons, and a home full of traps ready to destroy Michael Myers once and for all.
To say I was disappointed in this film is an understatement. It is not, by any means, a bad movie, and if you are a fan of 'slasher' films and are looking for a film where Michael Myers going round killing people, then you won't be disappointed.
I was just really frustrated with this movie.
Jamie Lee Curtis is by far the best thing in this film. Her portrayal of Laurie Strode is fierce and far more believable. In the first film, Laurie went through a really traumatic time, and she doesn't want to ever go through that again or expose anyone she loves to any of that either, so she becomes overprotective, paranoid and this I can really understand. She is secluded and is over-prepared for, what she knows is the inevitable escape of Myers, because she recognises that he is more than human, and still believes in 'the bogeyman'.
The character of Michael Myers in this film looks great, they haven't tried to alter his look in any way . The mask is good, again the filmmakers didn't make it a clean fresh mask for a new film (unlike in a couple of the other films in the franchise), and even the original actor Nick Castle reprised his role in a few scenes.
There are a few nods to the original movie, which were nice to see. However director David Gordon Green is better known for directing dramas and comedies, 'Pineapple Express' and 'Stronger' for example, and this is his first time directing a horror, and I have to say, it shows. There isn't much suspense, and a number of scenes which a seasoned horror director would have happily left out. This film also seriously lacks any 'atmosphere', the tension isn't really built up. There is also a lot of 'comedy' in this film which actually didn't work. Misplaced scenes which didn't mean anything, one especially was a scene between two cops in a car discussing their lunch and it just frustrated me as to why it was even there, it took away any tension of the part of the film it was in.
I think it's actually a very disjointed and unfocused film. It's definitely trying to be a tribute to the original, it's trying to be a horror in its own right, but it's also trying to be funny. There are also too many characters that have no purpose other than to run from or be killed by, Michael Myers and have nothing else to add.
This is one of the major things that frustrated me about the film, it was made to be a direct sequel to the original, it was made to ignore all the other films in the franchise and yet the filmmakers crammed so many unnecessary characters in it. I wanted to see more of Laurie Strode, it should have been about her but it was too focused on the ridiculous scenes and people who didn't matter, and this for me was when I lost interest in what was going on.
The new doctor was totally ridiculous. There is no way they could better Dr Loomis from the original and to try and replace him was a huge mistake, and there is a scene between the Dr and the cop, played by Will Patton, which was so unbelievably baffling and badly written and supposedly a 'twist', but lasted for about 2 minutes and then it was thrown away with a stupid ending, and I still wonder why it was included.
The film even opens with two journalist characters who are, from what I could tell, only there to give exposition, which most fans of the 'Halloween' film already know, to just go over the back story and, as an excuse to give Myers his mask back.
I really wanted to like this film, it was heavily advertised as the film that finally sees Laurie Strode kill Michael Myers, but the way it ended was so deflating. She traps him in the house, sets fire to the house, and we see him standing in the cellar surrounded by flames, it then cuts to Laurie and her family running away, then back to the cellar and, surprise, Michael has disappeared (although given the way that Laurie had her house totally secure and full of traps and bars etc, plus he was in the cellar with no means of escape, it's still mystifying as to how he did get out). With the sound of Myers' heavy breathing post-credits, you know that this is the lead up to a sequel (and it has been confirmed that this is the first of a trilogy).
As I said earlier, it is not a bad film, and many will watch it and think it was ok, but for me, it was seriously disappointing.",Halloween
389,antide-42376,Not great,5,29 February 2020,"I really expected this to be better than it was given the early reviews I had read. It's quite stupid in all honesty and probably worth watching for Jamie Lee Curtis although she has bizarrely turned into some kind of Sarah Connor character. The over the top Doctor was crazy and he even turned into an inexplicable murderer.Some scenes are OK, some just don't work at all and Michael kills and kills with no motive at all but I suppose he did do that in the original movie. Yes, he is a homicidal manic but still a human so how he can take being shot, smashed in the head with a crowbar, have his hand half shot off and still wander around as though he is as fit as a fiddle baffles me. Still it is only a movie.Oh yes, we didn't get to see him die at the end as everybody just assumed that he had burned to death in the house so just wait for the inevitable sequel. This was a disappointment with some reasonable bits but not many.",Halloween
390,AverageJoesDriveInPodcast,A Return to form and a lot of fun!,7,21 October 2018,"While this isn't a perfect movie, it was a lot of fun. I never once found myself getting bored. There were some good laughs, decent kills, the music was perfect and the film itself looked gorgeous. Truthfully, it reminded me more of the first two films than any of the other films in the franchise. Everything to the way shots were lit and framed to the overall coloring.If you're a fan of the series, even though they dismiss the other films in the series there are nods throughout to the original films. You really have to pay attention, but they are there. I thought the acting was well done. The way the story flows is great, it never gets bogged down on any one thing which I actually expected it to do. The way they explore the effects of victim trauma is really interesting as well.I'm sure this will have its haters. Anything new always does especially when it comes to a beloved franchise like this. Ignore any noise from the cry-babies who just want the same film over and over and enjoy this one. Let the sounds of your laughter drown out their thuds of kicking and screaming as they whine on the floor like a 2-year-old. Enjoy it for what it is and have fun.

391,henrys-88548,Mediocre But a Fun Halloween Treat,6,21 October 2018,"This movie lacks a strong gory opening and the first half is boring IMO. Despite changing the timeline and providing and alternate version of events from pervious versions, Jamie Lee Curtis ultimately plays the same exact character yet again, a paranoid woman obsessed with Michael Myers, so it only felt somewhat fresh. Despite all this, the movie picked up during the second half and I enjoyed myself. At one point, Myers briefly appears without a mask. He looked 70+ yet somehow has the superhuman strength of a 20 year old LOL. And Curtis, who is an anti gun activist in real life, carried around a semi automatic in probably half her scenes. In fact, she had an entire bunker full of high powered rifles and what looked like machine guns. LOL",Halloween
392,darklydreamingrahu,Unexpected Revival of a Stale Series,8,25 October 2021,"I didn't expect much from Halloween 2018.The Halloween franchise, with its multiple timelines and silly campiness, has been flailing for many years. Though Rob Zombie gave the world a fairly interesting take on the series back in 2007, every other film has been a dud.Until the 2018 revival.Jamie Lee Curtis is fiery and enthralling as the damaged Laurie, a woman still reeling from the Haddonfield murders 40 years ago. And given that Carpenter's biggest regret was his part in making Laurie related to Michael, the retconning of every single Halloween sequel is actually a breath of fresh air.This gritty reboot does fall into some of the same trappings of previous iterations, but nothing is too ham-fisted or referential. Michael is sufficiently scary, albeit he is much less of a supernatural force here. Instead, he is what Carpenter originally intended. A vicious, calculated monster.For fans of horror, however, some of the scenes will be pretty eye-rollingly predictable, and there are only two GOOD gore scenes in the film. The rest of the kills are your standard-fare, run-of-the-mill slasher stuff.The story is simple, therefore it's well-executed. There were no glaring plot holes or stupid inconsistencies that I noticed. Especially since it only uses the first film as canon. The acting is incredible, with Jamie Lee Curtis turning in a pained, haunting portrayal of Laurie that really revitalized the character in interesting ways.Overall, Halloween 2018 is one of the best films in the entire series. It hits all the right notes while staying true to its roots. It has a powerhouse performance through Curtis, and it nails the atmosphere of Haddonfield. If the actual horror had been a bit more diverse and unpredictable, this would probably be a classic. As it stands, it's still a great Halloween movie, and it will now be permanently added to my yearly October watchlist.8/10 for Halloween fans.7/10 for Horror fans who could take or leave Halloween.6/10 if you just don't care for horror or Halloween.",Halloween

The trailer was already great, and Halloween does not disappoint! 40(!) years later, and after so many genuinly great horror movies before it it still manages to scare and thrill me.Seeing Jamie Lee back in such an iconic role in a sequel that's actually great is magical. This film proves that Laurie Strode is as important as Michael is for its success, and I loved every minute of it.It had all the great stuff from the first Halloween, but also fit well into 2018 and its horror film standards. Good scares, it often kept me at the edge of my seat and I laughed at the right places.Best horror film I have seen in a long time. It is coming from a true Halloween fan, but I recommend it to everyone who just wants to have a good time watching a horror flick!I dont give it 10/10 simply because it did have a few clishé scenes that I think the writers should have been more creative with and some plot points that didn't really go anywhere.",Halloween
394,piggulu,"Didn't fall for the hype, was still disappointed",5,20 October 2018,"I'm not a die-hard fan, having only seen maybe 3 films out of the whole franchise a million moons ago, so sorry for my ignorance if need be.That said, I found this one extremely lackluster. Very little suspense beyond the opening scene of the with the reporters coaxing Michael with the mask, which is given in the trailers. Then the film devolves into highly questionable circumstances. After escaping, Michael merely plays a game of ""right place, right time"", appearing in places with no buildup or reason. No shots of him waiting, stalking, or putting fear into anybody; he's just there and does his thing. So unless he has some ESP that lures him to where anyone with the slightest link to the family is, it feels like jarringly fantastical coincidences. The kills are gruesome but most are off-screen.In between, there's a set of useless characters: the ""comic-relief"" father who is basically a checkmark to have a nuclear family, the sheriff who is apparently the only cop in town actually looking for Mike, and the cowboy who is apparently the boss of that sheriff and only appears just to be on-screen, the boyfriend, etc. None of them provide anything substantial except for the fan-service of the sheriff reprising his role. Then there's the considerable of people doing dumb things moments or ones of sheer disbelief that ruin the flow.As for the principal characters, Curtis is great as the overly cautious grandmother, as well as the mom who doesn't want to put up with it, and the granddaughter who wants to bridge them. However, that dynamic barely gets off the ground since there is actually very little interaction between them before the finale, and even then it feels severely contrived.I can't say how it scores as a franchise sequel, but as a horror/slasher film alone it doesn't get a pass.",Halloween

This was decent quality, a good build up and cracking ending.Three family generations offer a slasher version of girl power, all who could hold their heads up re their performances.There was a couple of eye rolling moments some of which almost can't be helped, but overall compelling and involving helped by the haunting and excellent music which I can hear in my head as I type.I think a great film for horror fans or simply fans of a good film.

Do not compare to the original, this is not a remake it is a DIRECT sequel to John Carpenter's Halloween. Probably the best of all sequels it is scary, suspensful and just well done. It goes back to John Carpenter's vision, which is Michael (the shape) has no motive or reason to kill the people he does. He is simply evil that can't be reasoned with, slowed, stopped or killed. John regretted making Laurie his sister, he said it was a mistake on more than one occasion. It took away the terror that is the man in the iconic pale mask. This film is well paced, good cinematography, more dynamic characters and performances than any of the other sequels. The only problem with this movie is, the doctor killing the cop to save Michael. It made no sense and wasn't cohesive with the story. He was supposed to be another loomis, who wouldn't stop until he stopped Michael. But other than that the rest of the film is pretty great.

It stars none other than Jamie Lee Curtis, who reprises her role (for the fourth time) as Laurie Strode, along with Judy Greer as her daughter, Karen, and introduces us to Andi Matichak as her granddaughter, Allyson.Set in present day, 40 years after the events of the first film, Michael Myers, now incarcerated (for the second time in his life), is greeted by two true-crime pod-casters, Aaron Korey and Dana Haines (played by Jefferson Hall and Rhian Rees) who interview him, or at least try to; one of (no surprise) even does the unthinkable by pulling out the supposed mask from the first film and shows it out in the open to Michael (as well as the fellow patients). Unfortunately though, both of them end up getting axed off within the start of the second act, which I found to be quite a bummer; but what do you expect from a slasher film?PROS:JLC continues owning the role of Laurie Strode, the young actress does a pretty good job of playing the granddaughter, and JG isn't half bad herself. The prologue scene is quite suspenseful, as is the climax. There is a scene with the granddaughter's friend as she is babysitting; if you've seen the trailer, you know exactly what I'm talking about. How that scene was structured, it actually made me care.CONS:If I could name one thing that I didn't like about this movie, it's the scenes with the granddaughter and her boyfriend. I mean, the film did set this dude up. But at the end of the second act, he makes a jackass of himself, setting the granddaughter off on her own (along with a friend of his), and just vanishes. What I also disliked was when the guy's friend began hitting on said girl: 1. I'm pretty sure that there have been similar scenes in other slasher films prior to this, specifically ones from the 80s 2. This is giving the viewer a legitimate reason not to care about him when he soon gets axed off by Myers.FINAL VERDICT:Not that this isn't a good film in any way, it just could've been better. It has few (if not many) flaws, as well as, imo, many missed opportunities. With all that said, this is, imho, the fourth (if not, fifth) best Halloween movie in it's saga, and I'm giving it an A-",Halloween
409,toonyjakes,Michael is pissed,7,21 October 2018,"Halloween has had a shaky plot history. You have 1-2, 4-6, H20/Resurrection, and then there is this, which I think continues only from the first film, since Laurie mentions that Michael killed 5 people (the same amount in the very first) Regardless, this film not only gives the series some life, it stands alone.Plot- Michaels been locked up for 40 years, 2 investigators visit him with his mask, and then they breifly visit Laurie Strode, who lives isolated and secure in the woods. Sure enough, Michael breaks out, and essentially unleashes hell. Aside the Rob Zombie entries (which stand completely apart from the others) this film is probly the most violent Michael movie. In fact there is one scene that some fans may not approve of, it kind of pushed Michael's boundaries a little far in terms of violence, yet it is still believable. They throw in a side plot with ""the new loomis"" which is interesting.Writing- Very natural script for a Horror flick, some pretty funny scenes that are timed appropriately, rather than spewing a stupid joke while being chased by the devil himself. Some corny lines that may seem cliche, but nothing overbearing.Characters/Acting- The new kids are pretty good actors, some are a little funny while others may seem too stereotypical. Jamie Lee is great as Laurie as usual, bringing a new side to the character. Supporting actors are unique. I'm not a fan of Judy Greer who plays Lauries daughter, I dunno she seemed a little confused as her character. All in all, good stuff.Quality- This film is probably one of the best shot entries in the series, next to the first. Alot of tense angles at the perfect times, sometimes following Michael for a whole sequence which is effectively creepy. The gore is really intense at some scenes, often showing detail, while also having some squishy off screen deaths.Overall I'd say they did the series justice, rather than just continuing from Resurrection, they kept it true by using a more cohesive story. As I said there's a scene some people may not like that determines the limits of Michaels acts, but it still shows alot. A friend of mine saw it, didn't like it at all for weird reasons- he wanted ""classic Michael""- which I guess I dont get cause he seemed pretty classic. I think I gave this a 7 just because there were a few classic flaws like sending one cop to deal with a whole bus of mental patients. But, I really liked it.",Halloween
410,diggerz039,I dont know how this has high ratings,4,21 October 2018,"The Rob Zombie remake in 2007 was brilliant. It showed pure brutality in which Myers.
This film though was just terrible. You barely see a murder. It just shows the aftermath. Also it seems to be a PC film with women taking the high ground and also any one who was killed was the 'same' if you know what i mean.
The fact that this is suppose to erase the sequals like H20 (with JLC in it) just makes this whole idea ridiculous. Sorry to day but this film was terrible. Watch Zombies versions which seem to give effort at a horror film",Halloween

412,MikeC19,"Halloween, the second....again!",5,19 October 2018,"Before I went to this movie, I was curious what other IMDB reviewers thought of this title, and took a look through the reviews. They were either loving every minute of it, or disliking it fully. My review.... hangs somewhere near the middle.I have no doubt in my mind that Jamie Lee Curtis is a good actress. I've never seen her in anything, where I didn't think she had a fantastic performance! There *isn't* much more for her to do in this movie, besides mope, scream and run, but I always believed her as her character, and think she's the best part of this film. Judy Greer stuck out, in my mind. I never really saw her as anyone other than who she is. I guess she's just too familiar a face for me. Michael Myers was intense in this one, so the actors playing him did quite well. The homages to the original are kind of fun, and the music is good, too. Unfortunately, though, I left with kind of a ""meh"" feeling. Better than most of the sequels, no doubt, but only marginally fun. 5/10",Halloween
413,martijn-56,"The best sequel so far, but the 1978 movie remains the one and only",7,27 October 2018,"Nice to see the whole cast (original behind the mask Michael, Jamie Lee Curtis, John Carpenter) team up again for a strong sequel to the original from 1978. Good to see too the makers of this sequel are as much a fan of the original as all of us, considering the many nods to classical scenes that made the 1978 movie the classic that defined a genre, and simply, made it to one of the best movies of all time.
It is always difficult to make a perfect sequel - one has to stay loyal to the original and yet show plenty of new stuff without making the sequel unrecognizable.
Halloween (2018) was, as we can see on the trailer, a solid chase movie, as the original was (madman escapes, goes on a killing spree, while his doctor and police hunt him, and this time Jamie Lee Curtis too), but I missed the real scary stuff. Somehow the 1978 Halloween used up all the scary tricks that any director can cram into one movie, it seems, which is why the original remains, well, a perfect movie.
An example of the H20 movie from 1998 I really liked was how Jamie Lee Curtis (portrayed as a psychological wreck, while being a strong woman of 2018 in this recent one) saw Michael's reflection everywhere in e.g. shopping windows, or in persons walking up to her from a distance. That was an inventive way to create new creepiness. I missed that inventiveness in this movie. What they did right though was that there was plenty of action, and it was a good choice to keep Michael's character as mysterious and blank as possible. And well, I liked the remake of the soundtrack. All in all, nice to see again and it was a movie worth the watch!",Halloween
414,hakeemtarabulsi,Let It Be The Last And Final Part,4,1 July 2019,"I always believed that producers should refrain from depending on the 'bright' history of a successful movie, just to inject a new part into the sequel, for the sake of titillating the old fancy memories of viewers.Guys, this part was full of smallness, no real or solid story, horrible plot, and the worst was the lousy performance, of everyone, including Jamie Lee Curtis, who is one of the producers, BTW.Please, let it be the last and final part, it's enough!",Halloween
415,michaelant555,Laughable!,7,16 December 2018,"To start with I want to have a gripe. The sickening and insane Hollywood liberalism indulgence about transgender and globalist food choices (Vietnamese sandwich scene) actually spoiled the film for me. That aside, the acting was good and it kept the original Halloween feel. The films starts with a couple of investigative journalists who want to do a story on Michael Myers who is ""currently"" :) in Prison. They track down Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to get information on Michael and we get to see a bitter, angry, and vengeful old lady still obsessed by her memories of her encounter with Michael in 1978. She's still itching to get her revenge on him. The reason I wrote Laughable! for my heading will become apparent when get to the final act. I've given it a 7 because it wasn't a bad film but I feel 6.5 is more appropriate for this.",Halloween

It's hard to describe it, but i guess It's like that friend that you kinda like, but they try sooooo hard to be like you and your other friends to fit in, imitating everything you all do. It's somewhat flattering even tho that's kinda lame, unoriginal, and unnecessary, but you still kinda dig them a little.It's like one homage scene (and i mean bordering on replicating old scenes) after the next, and kinda lazy at times, but it's occasionally enjoyable. No real suspense or improvements, but it kinda was amusing to watch sometimes.I definitely don't flat out hate it, but there's a ton that could've been better too. It's plot is really lazy, and Some of it is flat out silly, but if it was a generic slasher film it'd be decent. For Halloween, it's really lacking in atmosphere, and relays on gore and nostalgia vs storytelling and suspense (which is what made the original so classic)It's no way better than part 2, which was exiled for this to exist. I'll keep part 2 as canon forever. This can't even hold a candle to it, but as an ""elseworlds"" type of story, I suppose I can pass it with a C/C+ type grade.",Halloween

All low budget with wannabe actors just getting out of acting school. Dunno why, watched them all and none of them were any good. But as a slasher idiot, I kept watching them. This one probably is the worst of them all. Even Michael looked like he came out of a retirement home to slash some more. He should have slashed the producers for making this flick before he finished and went to cash his next Social Security check. Give it a rest Michael, go back to the retirement home with your cookies and milk. Take Jamie Lee with you, she's done as well. Gawd I sure hope they don't make anymore of these.

I almost start yelling don't go in there, don't do that...Afterwards I find it silly but I can't help it. Horrors, the good ones, evoke fear, terror and a sense of dread. This one is no exception. Story is a no-nonsense, cutthroat (pun intended) and straightforward, culminating with a decent send off. Forget the in-between sequels. Jamie excels as she should. I love how this movie is done with so much respect and homage to the original. Music is the final, significant touch, resonating with the original score. It is one of the best ever composed for the screen, in my opinion. Many gruesome scenes are alleviated with few welcomed comical moments. It's morbidly fun to see that Michael Myers has still got a wicked sense of humour.",Halloween

It has the greatest slasher ever in Michael Myers. The fear factor that Myers has is so unique and is what makes this movie scary. Laurie Strode is an awesome character. She has turned full survivor and it works so well. Soundtrack is as classic as ever. This movie does have flaws of course. A lot of bull that you can expect when you watch a horror movie as well as some plot points that weren't really concluded. The doctor was the big fault in this movie for me.

426,PeterWorthers,"The night he came home again..again. Not that last time, this is a NEW last time",8,19 October 2018,"After waiting so long and going through all the truck loads of hype, the new Halloween is finally upon us and it is Glorious.This movie is considered the official franchise part 2 to the original Halloween (so forget Halloween 2, or any other for that matter) and we pick up with our favorite scream queen 40 years later. The downside to all this is the plot is literally recycled from Halloween 4 (or part nothing o guess) - Michael is being transported to another place and the vehicle crashes then he escapes. Seriously, if you have seen ANY Halloween movie you got the plot already without even buying a ticket.Jamie Lee is at her best her, not a scream uttered, she is armed to the teeth and ready for her final confrontation with Michel Meyers. She also brings her daughter and granddaughter along for the ride this time. Theo only problem is that the daughter and granddaughter (as well as most of the other characters in the movie) fit the usual overdone horror movie 'types'.The daughter (the sceptic who thinks her mother is crazy and demands she get help or she'll never see them again) and Granddaughter (the ditzy teen that wants to fit in but whos boyfriend screws her over at the dance and can not be tracked down when the crap hits the fan) are the worst ones in the movie aside from the father (the typical I'm an idiot man, mean and think Laurie is a nutcase) they are the ones who do the stupid horror movie things 'tripping when the killer is after me' 'talking and shushing loudly when they're hiding from the killer'The 'final fight' is actually a lot better than you would expect, Michael is not going up against a victim, he's going up against an equal. Much more satisfying than Jason Verses Freddy.As with all movies I did have a few complaints, so here's my TRICK for this Halloween TREAT:1: The Granddaughter. She's supposed to be a modern tough woman of today and some times she seems just like that. Then her boyfriend cheats on her and she becomes every female horror movie character in history. Let me take a dark deserted shortcut I don't know home. I'm being chased by a killer, let me run through the deserted roads and bang on every door I can. I'm running through the woods being chased by the killer and I fall. I'm stuck in a vehicle with the bad guy and instead of take offered chances to escape I curl up in the corner and scream constantly. In a dark house followed by the killer, let me walk in and scream you name so he knows where we are.2: The husband. I can not express how much I wanted his character to die. He was supposed to come across as a tough love type of guy but it just played out as a dumb guy who was a huge jerk.3: The Easter eggs. It was cool seeing things from the other movies here and there, but it got to the point where almost every other shot was a re-creation of a scene from the original Halloween. I see the irony in the scenes and the tribute to the other movies, but at the same time I thought this was a new movie? Why keep copying the others? If I wanted that it'd just watch the original Halloween again. Also at one point you see three kids in the skeleton, the witch and the pumpkin masks from Silver Shamrock (Halloween 3, season of the witch) but if the other sequels didn't happen, did the silver shamrock company ever make those masks? But if they did then....OUCH! MY BRAIN!!4:The Halloween dance. During their 'argument' Allyson's boyfriend takes her phone and throws into (from what I could tell was a large glass bowl of vanilla pudding) and she just storms out. Really? As a teenage girl you're just gonna leave a thousand dollar IPhone stuck in pudding, with all our selfies and social media stuff and phone numbers, and not care about loosing all that? SURE.5: The British journalists. How did Michael know they were at the cemetery anyhow? They had a good day and a half if not two days to go anywhere, how did Michael track them down so quickly? Did he put a GPS tracker in his mask just in case? He must be really good at those pictures with hidden objects in them games.6: The therapist. His plot twist wasn't that much of a shock, you looked at him in the first scenes and thought ""There's something not right about this weirdo."" Hasn't this been done a billion times? Luckily this plot thread is stomped out quickly...get it? STOMPED?....Go watch the movie then re-read that.7. Laurie vs the neighborhood. So she knows Michael is there, ok. She goes there to kill him, ok. But once she gets there she starts flashing and swinging a gun around everywhere scaring people off? Then runs into the cop and he's just ""Oh, you're here to shoot and kill Michael, weird, so am I!""8: The little babysat kid. I don't know who that kid is but someone needs to give him his own series, he was hilarious. His jokes were funnier than any the jokes written into the script.9: The jokes. The bulk of them fell flat or where not needed. Like did we need a 5 minute comedy bit about the two cops lunches? It seemed like the movie was purposely stopped at certain times just for the jokes.10: Head butts. Apparently being locked up for 40 years give Michael enough time to trademark his new head butt killing move. Almost half the victims were head butted to death into a wall, door, car door, gate, a table, window; you name it he's slammed some poor unsuspecting schmucks head into it.11: The daughter and granddaughter in the bunker. The killer is above you, you are hiding in this bunker full of weapons and you start talking really loud to each other? Shut up! The whole idea of hiding is so that no one will find you. Also, you're in the bunker and no one thought to get a gun from the closet full of guns until the very last second? Do either of you really want to live? Also Laurie in the bunker earlier, she and her daughter are safe and what does she do? SHOOTS UP AT MICHAEL GIVING AWAY THEIR HIDING SPOT! If you're gonna do something as stupid as that first off, what good is the 40 years worth of training for?12: Laurie spying on Michael. You're in your car trying to drink your way to enough courage to shoot Michael and what weapon out of your huge heavy duty gun armory do you bring to finish him off once and for all? A small pistol. You were really going to get the chance you've wanted for 40 years and use the noisy cricket?13: The deletion of the other movies in the franchise. Here is my main problem with it. This is now the official sequel to the original. Ok. But though it everyone keeps calling him a monster and an unstoppable force. Lets think about that. A dude kills 5 people in the 70s (Like the drug kid said, is pretty small by our standards today) and he's considered an inhuman monster? He tried to kill Laurie and was captured so now she KNOWS he's going to come back. Why? He never gave any indication that he would. It could be a one time thing and that's it. Now, if we took this as part 3 and had the original and part 2 stand on its own THEN I'd get it. In part 2 he went bat crap crazy killing 11 people and chasing Laurie around trying to kill her. From that standpoint he WAS an unstoppable monster because he had come back and went on another killing spree. It just seems like trying to categorize him from the first movie makes him a light weight and no one of any importance, certainly no a monster you would use a manhunt to find and kill.Well, there you have it. My gripes are over.In the end Halloween delivers on the good old fashioned horror that made the 78 movie so good. This movie has heart, you KNOW the people involved are huge fans. You can tell this was not taken lightly and that this was a labor of love. Hey, seeing as how everything old is new again why not? Its been a while since we've seen Michael at his best and this is it. The fight every ones been waiting for.This movie may not make you believe in the boogeyman, but like many of us, you'll be glad he came home again.",Halloween

430,mulcahyj-07545,Exceeded expectations greatly! Recommended viewing.,7,14 March 2019,"This film, for me, was a great watch. I was expecting average at best with its concept. One attraction was a complete ignoring of some of the past sequels and 'reboots' as they were just rubbish. The change of chronology was not an issue for me. And I am still recovering from the Rob Zombie movies. I think at some point he will make a classic. But he has not as yet though i can see his vision he has not been able to put them in a movie. House of 1000 Corpses and The Devils Rejects had so many great ideas but both films are flawed. The Devils Rejects especially as it without any soul. If you watch it you may agree. His versions of Halloween are films I can not even give a review to. They are beyond my vocabulary to write what i think of them. But i digress...This is a new start and link to the John Carpenter classic Halloween. Everything in between in terms of average and downright waste of time Halloween films are erased. I have tried to erase them from my mind desperately. This helped it in immensely.But I was still worried how it would be and if I would waste my time watching it. I think it was scripted very well and the cast are superb. Not least Jamie Lee Curtis who does a brilliant job and puts her heart in to it. Shows all her faults as well as, at times hidden until the film progresses stamina and fight. No spoilers here by the way!The movie has a few plot holes and downright unbelievable plot devices especially at the beginning which if you think too much are laughable. And more present themselves as the movie moves on. But you have to take a step back and just enjoy it. One of the best horror movies I have seen for a long time. If you are expecting Citizen Kane (which I love but the plot holes are glaring) not for you.If you want to enjoy a horror movie like the original Halloween I would recommend. It links in to the first movie well (which if you think about too much had again plot holes) and give a thrilling ride.My last point will be controversial. I think it is better than the 1978 movie it continues. That will not go down well at all with some John Carpenter fans. I can only say that I am a huge fan of Carpenter and it comes across as one he could do with a bigger budget. It has, I think his blessing. He was a producer or executive producer I can't remember at this point. I am still just thinking of watching it again it was so enjoyable to me.Bottom line, if you enjoyed Halloween 1978 I don't think you will disappointed. I think my rating of 7/10 might be too low. I may reconsider it. But as I have said it is not Citizen Kane. It is a horror movie which more than delivered for me. Excellent.",Halloween
431,HairyMart1,Halloween 3 still the best sequel,5,27 October 2018,"It all started so well - not a remake, but the 40 year sequel to the original. All in-between films forgotten, and John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis back on board. With sn intriguing set up to bring a new insight into the ""slasher"" genre, with a look at the emotional toll of surviving such an attack. So for the first half the revised background is revealed, key characters are established and all neatly cued up for the inevitable deathly mayhem, which kicks and generates a surprising number of gruesome deaths. But as things move forward, they also in terms of originality, move back, with the script lapsing into the familiar clichés of characters making the dumbest decision, and ridiculous plot contrivances being necceaary to allow the film to continue. Such a shame, as it did seem to be doing some thing smart.",Halloween

Michael, for example, was too visible. You could tell exactly where he was most of the time rather than him just appearing and scaring the hell out of you. He also seemed intent on killing randomly vs. as in the first movie where his targets were young couples or teenagers. Part of the movie were silly in my opinion. Who drives upon a bus accident, with men in prison uniforms wandering around, and leaves their kid in the car? Really?? I wanted to scream at people who knew how to handle a gun but just stood there in fear. Get your gun!!! Overall, I was extremely disappointed!",Halloween
434,zanghi_james,"Halloween: The Blumhouse Sequel delivers thrills, chills, and a nice plate of gore and blood!",8,18 December 2019,"I really enjoy Jason Blum's production company and I have enjoyed either the actual films he has produced or (at the very least) the concept of the films he has produced. Despite me being a total horror film novice, I think Blumhouse is a good producer of the genre, and his sequel to John Carpenter's iconic slasher horror flick is an excellent representation of Jason Blum's company of thrills and chills.Set forty years after Michael Meyers' murderous rampage through Haddonfield that ended with him being shot by his own doctor and a young girl traumatized, this film shows that most people have been able to move on from the slaughter...most people, except Laurie Strode, who is thoroughly traumatized and forever changed by Michael. Then, as Michael is being transferred to a maximum security prison the night before Halloween, the bus crashes...and the carnage quickly begins again.I really enjoyed this film, even though I watched it less than a week before Christmas 2019, which kind of seems sacrilegious and tasteless. The three main actors (Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, and the new girl playing the granddaughter) are all awesome. Jamie Lee Curtis gives one of the best performances I've seen her give in a film and is a total bad in the process, but it's Judy Greer, who I have always seen in previous films as the quirky yet quiet motherly type, who gives a surprisingly different take on her usual performance with an excellent twist near the end. The teen who plays the granddaughter is also pretty cool and I hope she returns for the sequels. But the true star of the film, of course, is Nick Castle, reprising his role of Michael Meyers. He is totally vicious and never says a bleeping word as he carves up all these people in this film.The music is top-knotch and quite different from what you usually hear in Horror Films these days. I really love the original Halloween theme by John Carpenter, and it is magnificently brought back to life in this film. I think the use of techno-synthesizer was a nice choice for the rest of the music and is quite jarring, especially with all the horror movies these days trying to live up to Joseph Bishara's scores for The Conjuring films and Insidious.The best part of this film is they don't try at all to make Michael a sympathetic character. They make it perfectly clear he is just an evil being. I agree, that some killers need to be studied, and ones who are mentally disturbed deserve some level of understanding, but still, Michael killed a bunch of people, and he doesn't deserve to be a victim.I should also mention that I have seen two of the other Halloween movies: John Carpenter's original and Rob Zombie's remake. I think that David Gordon Green, Danny McBride, and Jason Blum made the right decision to start another timeline with this film and directly spin-it-off from John Carpenter's original Halloween. The whole take that Rob Zombie did was a little too twisted for me. I think this film not only lives up to Carpenter's original, but elevates it. Keeping it an R rated film was a good idea, also, since so many potentially good Horror films get bogged down with the PG-13 rating and are cut up in the process of making them more accessible.I do have a couple of things that irk me about this film, nevertheless. Aside from Michael's refusal to speak and reasons for his killings, there's the ending, which I find ambiguous and abrupt. Also, I think that the upcoming sequels won't be as good as this film, mainly because they will have trouble living up to the hype of this film, but also what happens to Michael Meyers in this film. I think after you go through what he went through at the end of the film, it's pretty hard to come back.Nevertheless, this film was pretty good. If they officially go through with 'Halloween Kills' and 'Halloween Ends', maybe they could get Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor to do the score, especially since they've put together a killer remix of the iconic Halloween theme.",Halloween
435,watcher101,The reboot that keeps forgetting it's a reboot,6,15 January 2019,"While I enjoyed the movie, making it a sequel-reboot left it with several unnecessary flaws. The biggest issue I had with this movie was that it seemed to forget that it was a reboot that's supposed to ignore all the other movies except the first. This movie repeatedly forgets or flat-out ignores that it's a reboot because it acts like the other movies did happen. Let me explain.While it's horrible that Michael killed 5 people, everyone was acting like he was Charles Manson or something. There is a lot of violent crime in the world, far worse than what Michael did in the first movie, yet in this movie he's so infamous that everybody knows about him. Had this been a follow up to the other 8 movies, then his ""fame"" would make sense. Rather, the infamy of Michael seemed to be for us since we as an audience know who he is and what he's truly capable of, but in universe, none of the characters, not even Laurie, know this, yet the movie seems to forget this and plays it off as if they do.They also acted like his mask meant something special to Michael, claiming it was ""part of him"". Again, while this may have worked if the other movies had taken place, having the mask mean this much or making Michael out to be anything more than a deranged killer to anyone else besides those that knew him, didn't work with only the first movie coming before this one. If only the first movie takes place before this one, then the mask was nothing more than a random mask he picked up and wore for a single night of killing. It wasn't like the sequel movies where he wore it for years and year, and even gotten another one just like it when it was destroyed, yet they acted like it was super important.Lastly was Laurie's paranoia and obsessive drive to kill Michael. Again, had this movie been a sequel to the H20 timeline, then Laurie's obsession would have made sense, but having only the first movie take place before this one completely blew Laurie's character out of proportion by turning her into a Sarah Conner preparing for Judgment Day or something. What exactly made her so ""sure"" that Michael would come for her one day for some final confrontation? If you don't count the 3 times she caught a glimpse of him in the first movie, their only interaction was a 5 minute chase scene after she just happened to walk in on his killing grounds. There was no supernatural drive, or ""reason"" behind his targeting her that would make her the way she was. Yes, I could see her being scarred from the experience and having PTSD, and I can even see her turning into a badass who swears to never be a victim again, but having her so absolutely sure that Michael was somehow going to escape and come after her one day that she literally lives her whole life around this belief, even turning her entire house into a trap, and living for the sole purpose of killing him is not only stupid, but doesn't make sense. Again, had this been a sequel to H2, H20, and HR, it would have made sense, but not as a simple sequel to the first movie. An easy way to fix all this could have been to keep it as a sequel to HR where Laurie somehow survived the stab and fall, and then just tweak a few plot elements here and there. Instead they tried to erase the whole Halloween timeline while still trying to ride on its coattails.Speaking of Michael's fixation with Laurie. Was there actually one in this movie? Technically, he didn't go after her specifically. After the doctor let him loose, he just went around killing random people, and just happened to come across Laurie's granddaughter after she wandered into his killing grounds; he didn't even know who she was. After that, he was brought unconscious to Laurie's house, where he merely continued his killing spree. He never actually went afterLaurie specifically. So it wasn't actually personal for him at all, because based on how things played out, he was just going around killing anyone in his path, and by circumstances completely out of his control, had Laurie placed in his path again, and he merely continued his killing spree.You see, this is why this movie forgets it's a reboot so much, because it acts like the other movies did happen, even though they didn't in this continuity. Also, I must make it clear that I hate how they erased so much of Michael's mythology, particularly his motivation, his drive to kill, and his connection and reason to go after Laurie. I know it was an attempt to make him seem ""scarier"", like there was no reason for choosing her, it was simply a random act, and therefore it can happen to anyone, but it felt like that didn't work. Simply having chosen her at random 40 years ago, and having him so intent on hunting her down decades later for literally no reason was just strange since there was no connection between the two of them, especially since, as I stated above, that wasn't even what happened since he never specifically went after her. And don't tell me that they were ""fixing"" what they did in making them brother and sister in H2 because that was never supposed to be the intention in the first movie. That would be like saying that Darth Vader isn't really Luke's father or that Leia isn't Luke's sister because that wasn't the intention in the first movie. Besides, there actually were clues in the first movie that hinted at the two of them being brother and sister, and they just didn't become obvious until it was directly stated in H2.Aside from the forgetting/ignoring it was a reboot thing, the movie had several plot points that simply went nowhere, and it had a stupid twist in making Michael's doctor evil (one of the plot points that went nowhere). Also, it was kind of weird seeing Michael as a 60 something year old man. But overall, I enjoyed the film. I'd rank it #7 out of the 11 movies in the franchise, and give it a 6 out of 10.",Halloween
436,Camerenth,Disappointingly generic,7,21 October 2018,I was hoping for Blumhouse to spark the franchise back to glory. But it sadly falls under the tropes of most modern generic horror movies.

442,AllanSmitheee,Another mediocre sequel to a franchise that should have died already,4,19 October 2018,"If you were to retcon 21 years of sequels, one should try to make something more than the same formulaic jump scare fest in the process. Because that's exactly what David Gordon Green's Halloween is, with nothing new added to the mix.Forty years after enduring Michael Myers' killing spree, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now a PTSD-ridden recluse living for the day Michael returns to Haddonfield. Her intense survivalist ways have already estranged her from her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer), but maintains contact with her granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak).A transfer from Smith's Grove to a maximum security prison is derailed and, as to be expected, Michael escapes and resumes his murderous ways, from guards to random neighbors to, you guessed it, babysitters. The final showdown comes to a head with three generations against Michael, and the final scenes leave you with that curiosity: They're making a sequel, aren't they?The answer: While nothing has been confirmed yet, the film's producer, modern horror extraordinaire Jason Blum, has said that if it performs, they will. With a $10 million budget, it will. Cue another few decades of crappy sequels no one asked for.Curtis, sixteen years after her last turn as Laurie, returns to great form. Unfortunately, not much can be said for anyone else. The young cast perform just as well as anyone in a slasher film. And it's mostly the youngsters that bring in the humor, nearly none of which is actually funny.But it should be noted that of John Carpenter's iconic score, revolutionized alongside his son Cody and godson Daniel Davies. Despite most of the film's shortcomings, the music was a real treat to experience in Dolby Cinema. 2.5/5.",Halloween

444,HorrorFan6969,easily the best movie in this franchise since 1978,8,12 September 2018,"It's safe to say that there are probably enough movies in the Halloween franchise. Giving fans seven sequels, one remake, and a sequel to that remake is plenty. Busta Rymes was enough... Rob Zombie make it even worse !Yet, here we are with a 40-year-late sequel to the 1978 John Carpenter classic that pretends none of the previous continuity exists. They didn't even bother adding anything to the title to avoid confusion. But they did get Jamie Lee Curtis back for the first time in 20 years.Plus John Carpenter is technically back, just as a producer and composer ensuring that he wasn't responsible for figuring out how to kick the dead horse one last time while still getting to leave his fingerprints all over the synthesizers on the soundtrack. And who was hired to provide an ending to the Michael Myers saga? Why the co-director and star (but only as a writer) of Eastbound And Down of course! Sounds like a very bizarre take on a dead franchise, huh? Would it surprise you to learn that Halloween 2018 is the best film in the series since the original? Well, it sure surprised the hell out of me. No hyperbole. This flick is fan-friggin-tabulous.Apparently, when David Gordon Green asked John Carpenter for advice on how to proceed with his film de Michael Myers, the master replied, ""make it simple and make it relentless."" Sound advice and thank god Green followed it. He'd never made a horror film before (although he was signed on to remake Suspiria for a hot minute), nor had his co-writer Danny McBride. But you'd never know it while caught up in the throws of this updated slasher schlock. The plot is indeed simple. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laura Strode, clearly still suffering from the trauma of that fateful Halloween night many moons ago. It caused her to become estranged from her family and move out into hermit country, Illinois. However, she did eventually find a focus in life: good old-fashioned revenge. She's trained herself to be a gun-toting badass just hoping that Mikey Myers might return just so she can be the one to blast his stupid face off. Well, it happens. On Halloween, no less. There are also a variety of other characters introduced. Guess what happens to them?So yeah, we're firmly in slasher movie land here, just fused to a female empowerment revenge movie. And hey, since the empowered woman getting revenge is the original final girl from the original slasher movie, that means there's oodles of fuel for material to fill gender studies horror thinkpieces for years to come and it's pretty gosh darn obvious that's all very much intended. Yet thankfully, Green and McBride didn't let themselves get lost in the tasty subtext. It's all there, but the filmmakers know that anyone showing up for a Halloween movie just wants to be entertained and thankfully there's plenty of that to go around.First up, the movie is consistently hilarious. Every character gets at least one big laugh, especially one particularly sassy kid. That almost goes without saying from the Eastbound And Down guys. They also make it clear that they are fans and from the gorgeous twist on the old jack-o-lantern opening credits sequence on they litter this thing with in-jokes, references, and fan service. Not in a winky-winky ""aren't we clever"" way either. More subtle nods that won't get in the way for viewers who don't care, but will add extra bursts of geeky glee for those who do. And while the narrative ignores continuity from all of the previous Halloween follow ups, the references take time to even acknowledge the Myers-less Halloween III: Season Of The Witch and the remake.Of course, none of that really matters unless this slasher movie delivers the spooky and gory goods, right? Well, good news, there's plenty of splatter throughout the slaughter. David Gordon Green's roving widescreen cameras somehow manage to recapture the elegant suspense mastery of John Carpenter. Early on, Myers' shenanigans are subtle and suspense-driven, intricately crafted gasps and creeps sure to please the purists. But the gang also realize that horror has moved on since 1978 and fans demand generous dollops of the red stuff to keep them happy. So, things do indeed get nasty, as much as any entry in this franchise that came before. At one point or another in the running time, Green tries his hand at orchestrating all of his favourite types of cinematic scares (including one surreal run through the woods involving a bunch of rotted out mannequins that offers a taste of what his Suspiria might have been) and nails almost all of them. If David Gordon Green never makes another horror movie, at least he got to dabble in it all. But hopefully he will. This guy can dish out the goods. Of course it helps to have a delightfully creepy John Carpenter score (his first in far too long!) running underneath. Obviously.And it sure helps that Green got Jamie Lee Curtis back as well. She's spectacular as the new, improved, and bad ass Laurie. It's not an exaggeration to call it one of her best performances and everyone around her lives up to the standard she sets. It's amazing just how well this flick turned out. It could have been a disaster. It should have been a disaster. Yet somehow, it works. So gosh darn entertaining and creepy and funny and smart and reverential and seductive and bloody that there's something to please every horror fan who buys a ticket for a cheap thrill. Halloween: Here We Go Again really is a best case scenario. It's a perfect way to end the series, right down to the last shot. Sadly, it's also the first Halloween movie produced by Universal Studios since 1982. They've got a theme park and merchandising department to maintain. If this flick is a hit, there will be more. So enjoy this slice of fan-baiting franchise perfection while you can. It won't last. Real evil never dies, after all. Especially when there are t-shirts to be sold.Against all odds and logic, the Halloween sequel/finale/redux/whatever is easily the best movie in this franchise since 1978.",Halloween

449,kayrannells,Why?,4,13 October 2020,"Halloween wipes the sequel slate clean, pretending that Michael Myers was captured right after the events of the first film and has been kept in a sanitarium for the past 40 years. Some idiots in charge think it would be a great idea to repeat the events from 40 years ago and transfer him to another facility the night before Halloween. Obviously, he breaks out and returns to Haddonfield, killing any random people he can find, but Laurie Strode, his sole surviving victim from 40 years ago has been waiting for him. Why she's been waiting is a bit of a mystery since this film eliminates the brother/sister bond they had from part 2 forward.This is the biggest issue Halloween can't overcome - the question of why it needed to be told. It's well shot, Michael looks threatening for the first time in a while, and the decision to bring John Carpenter back to score the film was a wise one, but it's a movie that doesn't need to exist at all. We learn nothing about what Laurie Strode has been doing these past 40 years and she becomes a one dimensional basket case.

453,LegendsofHorror,Movie Review: Halloween (2018) Please Read....,5,25 February 2019,"The word Halloween has become synonymous with Michael Myers to horror fans around the world. Death was born in 1978 with imagination and care of John Carpenter and Debra Hill. In 1981, they continued his night of terror which ended with him and his doctor fighting to the death in a fiery hospital blaze.Throughout the years, the fans were left wanting more. Not many know this fact but, originally the HALLOWEEN series was meant to have a new tale released every Halloween about a new horror, (IE. Werewolves, Vampyres, Daemons, Ghosts & Etc.) Sadly the target audience didn't understand that at the time, they wanted more Michael. This is how the now cult classic ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" came to be. The Silver Shamrock tune is quite undeniably catchy.
So over the years, various directors brought Michael back to life making him more almost zombie-like and a unstoppable killing machine. One of the highlights of the later parts of the series was though was when they decided bring back Jamie Lee Curtis' original character and kinda do a ""Tommy Jarvis"" trilogy thing like they did in Friday the 13th. Those films did real well with bringing everything fill circle back from 1987 to 1998.
Now, we are coming into the year 2018, and its been 40 years since the original film has come out. Here is where it gets interesting...When this new film comes out, the hardcore fans may find ALOT of familiarities and that is because every single film from the Original film to H20 have been homaged in this new film.This new film is NOT a sequel of the original it is in fact, a standalone HALLOWEEN amalgamation of everything I have just mentioned above from HALLOWEEN 1-7. It is the BEST FAN FILM and the most expensive, because you can tell that Jeff Fradley, Danny McBride, & David Gordon Green took this into consideration as avid HALLOWEEN fans themselves which is obvious they put there complete hearts into this project.0. The Opening sequence was the EXACT 1978 one but in reverse/ The END credits are the EXACT same.1. They returned the Original (Nick Castle) as Michael, a aging sociopathic killer.2. The Classroom scene Frankel's interpretation (Laurie Outside 2018) (Michael Outside 1978)3. Bus accident transporting Michael where he escapes - (Halloween 4 1988)4. Dinner Scene Laurie mentions she was in the honor club - (Nod to Halloween 1978)5. Detective(1978)/Reporters(2018) walks in graveyard looks for tomb of Judith Myers6. Gas station scene Michael kills mechanic steals his clothes and kills everyone therein and escapes - (Halloween 4 1988)7. The couples and Halloween costume party dance- (H20 1998)8. Three kids that are trick or treating are wearing SILVER SHAMROCK MASKS!!! - (Halloween 3 1982)9. Falls to their ""death"" but evades their attacker (Laurie Outside 2018) (Michael Outside 1978)10. Michael Ultimately burns to his death - (Halloween 2 1981) (Halloween 2018)11. Listen carefully in the END credits....Michael breathing (Halloween 1978)
I had some beefs with the script, like I didn't like when Michael killed a child that could have been left out that did nothing to advance the story whatsoever. Although I loved the brutality and ferocity of the killings, I felt that there was some mercy there in Myers at times. To be honest, he didn't come across as menacing as he should. The new Loomis character ""Dr. Sartain"" played by Haluk Bilginer was in my opinion written darker than Myers but I do believe that was the intention because when you stare into the abyss, something will stare back into you.
I did like the acting of the young actress Andi Matichak, I think she has one hell of a future ahead of her. Jamie Lee Curtis as always pulled off a strong performance as Laurie, as well did Judy Greer as her daughter Karen. James Jude Courtney took over the second half of the film as the shape and put his spin on it for the fans. All in All this horror fan enjoyed this film for what it was definitely NOT a sequel NOT a reboot but a film written by fans for fans. That being said, Jeff Fradley, Danny McBride, & David Gordon Green great job!!!ON A SIDE NOTE: JOHN & CODY CARPENTER'S SCORE KICKED SO MUCH A$$, IT GAVE ME GOOSEBUMPS!!!",Halloween
454,EnoVarma,"""Green Halloween""",6,20 October 2018,"There are now 11 films in the Halloween franchise; this one is the first sequel directed by someone whose skills equal John Carpenter's. The result is the second best in the canon. The new ""Halloween"" is very, very well directed with a great cinematic vocabulary, so to speak. Green is extremely talented, and the movie comes close to being very good indeed.The problem is the script. This is conjecture, but I suspect the weakest lines are mostly penned by the comedian Danny McBride: they sound too much like him. But there are problems with the structure as well, the movie takes its time to really get going. Although, the intro is dynamite.It's worth noting that thematically, there is a subtle but poignant criticism towards masculine violence (represented by Michael Myers). This ""Halloween"" is very much a female story - like the original was. Having said that, I'm still not sure if Jamie going all Linda Hamilton was the right choice. She's great, regardless.Finally, the stylish ""Green Halloween"" just doesn't feel scary enough. The ending lacks punch. And that is all.",Halloween

Admittedly, I'm not a fan of the original, either. Let's just say that the Rob Zombie version of 2007 was THE one for me, more my slice of cake, especially during the kitchen scene.

It's an interesting approach and does wipe out the atrocious ""Halloween: Resurrection"" from continuity, at the very least.I really wanted to like this movie a lot more, being a big fan of John Carpenter's original, but I can only say it's okay or fair. It starts out pretty strong, with an unsettling opening scene and elements like the title sequence being a direct homage to the original film (""Halloween III"" playing on a TV is great call back to the first ""Halloween"" playing on a TV in ""Halloween III"") but some questionable choices get made and it seems to lose its way as the movie progresses. The characterizations of several characters are inconsistent, switching back and forth between badass and panicky. The lead teenage character who we think the torch is going to be passed to just doesn't cut it. And the end is quicker than I would have expected, feeling a little unsatisfying and reminiscent of ""H20"".See it if you're a fan of the series.

458,rolandjordaan2,Halloween - Spoiler Free Review,5,20 October 2018,"Horror movie fans are a lot like domestic abuse victims, no matter how bad the movies in a franchise get, somehow, we'll always still come back for more, case and point: the Halloween franchise. One would think that the abysmal Busta Rhymes sequel, followed by the, actually quite painful to watch, Rob Zombie reboot series, would have been enough to bury Michael Myers once and for all, but, instead, less than 10 years later, studios made an announcement that another Halloween film was in the works, John Carpenter would be involved and it would be a direct sequel to the 1978 original...hearing this, of course, fans reacted like they had just learned about the second coming...I know, because I was one of them.
Playing off 40 years after the original (and 20 years after H20 - that can't be a coincidence), the movie once again stars Jamie Lee Curtis, reprising the role of Laurie Strode. Following the events of that one night, Laurie has basically become Sarah Connor from 'Terminator 2', training herself to become this absolute survivalist, teaching herself hand to hand combat, how to fire any conceivable type of fire arm, setting up her house with escape routes...basically, just dedicating her whole life to a second encounter with Michael Myers that only she believes is coming. She raised her daughter the same way, putting a great strain on their relationship, even more so now that her daughter has reached adulthood and has a teenage daughter of her own. Judy Greer stars as the daughter of Jamie Lee Curtis, and I have to admit, the relationship between these two characters, I found to be one of the most compelling things about this film, because, even though she treats her mother badly, we put ourselves in Judy Greer's shoes and we get it...both actresses, but Jamie Lee Curtis in particular, bring quite a bit of depth to their characters, we sympathise with both and their unique points of view and we want to see them reconciled; this was one elements to the film that truly worked. Meanwhile, in the other part of the story, Michael Myers, who has been locked up in a penitentiary for the last 40 years, is about to be transferred; two radio pod-casters are doing a story about him and the events that happened 40 years earlier, and wish to interview him, before the transfer. This sub-plot about the radio podcast, oddly enough, was another part of the film I found myself very invested in and I wish it could have gotten more focus; it offers some interesting theories about what may have caused Michael to become evil and opens the door to what could have been a completely different, and in my opinion, better movie. It all comes to an abrupt halt though, as, on the night of Michael's transfer, the bus crashes, Michael is able to escape, another killing spree starts...and the movie loses my interest. Some of you may recall, that in the original film, Michael Myers only murdered a hand full of people; this gave the movie time to really focus on those kills, build the suspense, give us time to get to know the victims and, overall, just make a bigger impact...in this film, Michael Myers has basically become Jason Voorhees, trying to fit in as many kills as humanly possible, before those end credits roll, and, at times, it just feels forced and unnecessary; that is my main problem with this movie, too much of it feels forced: there is this ridiculous sub-plot regarding Michael's new psychiatrist that will leave you scratching your head and wondering what, exactly, the point to that was; Will Patton, starring as the new Sheriff, gets a hell of a lot of screen time but it all really just ads up to nothing, there are also moments of comic relief thrown in at the worst possible times, and completely ruining some of the most suspenseful moments. The original movie, had very little humour in it, sure there was some earlier on when it was establishing the characters and giving them unique traits, therefore, it served a purpose...here it's just comic relief thrown in, because, apparently, in 2018, viewing audiences simply are no longer capable of watching horror movies without breathers, in-between.
Now, I'm not saying that this movie does all the scary scenes wrong, there is a scene in a bathroom that's actually quite intense to watch and gets close to capturing that old Halloween feel, also a scene with him stalking a babysitter. Both these scenes are clever nods to earlier films, and that was something I very much did like about this movie, there are tons of these spread out throughout the movie, but each one of them with their own unique twist. A scene with Laurie's granddaughter sitting in a classroom and starring out the window, just like Laurie did in the original film, was, surprisingly, one of my favourite scenes...even if it only lasted a few seconds.
All and all, this sequel really wasn't awful by any sense of the word, actually, there are some things about it that are quite great...Jamie Lee Curtis, the pod-casters, many of the earlier scenes...this movie had a lot of potential, and, in some ways, many actually, it's a worthy sequel, BUT when you have the balls to step into an arena, publicly announce that you are discrediting all the earlier sequels, that this will be the only sequel that matters: then you have to deliver, you have to make something that stands out, something that is better than all those earlier films, and, unfortunately, this movie was simply not able to pull that off...so, good movie, not great, but if you're a horror fan...we both know that you won't be able to resist seeing this film, and frankly, for a 21st century horror film, you can still do a hell of a lot worse.",Halloween
459,bbjzilla,Beam me up pumpkin.,7,4 June 2019,"The opening titles play the famous theme in as a decomposed pumpkin lantern returns to rude health in reversed footage, an obvious reference to the movie's revisionist approach to the franchise.
In the film's favour, it's largely coherent and boasts some fine performances from the female leads but it's at it's best when it apes the original, resembling more of a homage than a sequel.
But as with Myers himself, the film is rather banal. He is the most vanilla of psycho murderers so not a lot really happens, Michael's antics are not entirely shocking or interesting, although there is that pervading sense of creepy dread that permeated the original.
Other characters are so repugnant that you find yourself rooting for the killer, perhaps intentionally so on the part of the writers who are usually producing comedy. However, somewhat refreshingly, there is nothing to be laughed at as the film (mad doctor aside) is played almost totally straight.
It's a film made by incredibly professional filmmakers who add little, or nothing, new here but seem to have a mission to rescue a film they clearly adore from the camp graveyard of it's own franchise, It is mostly successful in that regard, but there are none of the flourishes that made the production house's other movies so interesting.",Halloween

461,cinemawithcj,Halloween - Cinema with CJ Review,6,1 December 2018,"Halloween (2018) sees the return of Michael Myers and the retcon of countless sequels (and that one reboot). Essentially the new Halloween II, who would have thought it would come from in part Danny McBride and David Gordon Green?Jamie Lee Curtis becomes Laurie Strode by way of Sarah Connor here, having prepared herself for Myers' return from day one. Its been decades and she's filled that with learning how to shoot, how to trap, and how to be a questionable parent. It's inevitable that this movie would get Terminator 2 comparisons, and in regards to theme and storytelling, its pretty well done. It even adds a further level with Strode being a grandmother who has been pushed away from her daughter so she can barely see her granddaughter, even if Laurie is certain she's right. There's something about three generations of women facing adversity and conflict and manipulation from the world of less capable and/or scary men.And while we can mention the several examples, I'm guessing you're more here to find out how Michael Myers is handled. The way that he is is definitely the weakest part of this movie. There was something about the indie film sensibility of the 1978 version and its almost bloodless murders. 2018's Halloween feels like the bigger budget sequel that would be made in the 80s and that's not the best thing. Myers feels more like Jason Voorhees, killing more graphic and violent here, including a knife stab more at home in Friday the 13th 3-D. That's the thing with it being made today after the legacy and the increase of talent and budget. Halloween is made bigger and better, and in some places that works well, and others not so much.Make no mistake, Halloween is still creepy and tense, but the threat of Michael Myers is now cartoonish.For every great moment or callback there is a moment that pulls you out of it. Where the sequel can't ignore the modern update. It's the Force Awakens affect on the filmmaking of the original trilogy. Made by fans but needlessly updated and enhanced, full of cool ideas that forget the truth of the original.And it's that Myers is pure evil, and he doesn't have to crush a face with his foot to prove that.",Halloween

463,songbirdmc,Heartbreakingly Disappointing,3,8 September 2019,"As a long time fan of Halloween I'm always very excited to see a new Halloween film being released especially with Jamie Lee Curtis. I understood going in that this is supposed to be the true sequel which in it of itself was a little hard to wrap my brain around because being a true Halloween fan I've seen all of the Halloween movies. Having to pretend that those other films never existed and that this movie left off where the first one ended would be difficult, but that was just the beginning. Next we need to believe that Michael Myers, a man that was portrayed as superhuman in the original movie is now just a man. Not just a man, but an old man. Sure, he may still be strong, but without that supernatural element that we are so used to Michael Myers in turn lost his magic-his ability to terrify. He's just not as scary in this movie. If you add all that to how disjointed this film felt it's a huge disappointment. The editing was horrible. The sequences felt out of order somehow and things were drawn out too much. A lot didn't make sense, the kill scenes had no build up, and as I mentioned before Michael just wasn't as scary. Did it have moments of momentum? Yes, but just barely and they were few and far between. I'm so confused as to how so many true Halloween fans can be so thrilled with this sadly disappointing film. I think making it a ""true"" sequel was a very bad idea.",Halloween

Unfortunately that isn't going to happen for everyone. It's going to be very hard to make a film that tries to stay faithful to the original, while at the same time telling a new story while being filmed 40 years after the original. Insanely hard undertaking I would think.You can ignore any review that gives a movie of this caliber (or most any movie for that matter) a 1 star rating because it's the equivalent of a child's temper tantrum. Was it a masterpiece? No, that would be a rating that could be reserved for the original. Were there things I an issue with? Absolutely. I could have done without the humor for one, it doesn't belong here, but I laughed none the less. You can't capture lightning in a bottle twice, but they did an great job trying.",Halloween

I guess they could get away with it since Judy Greer looks younger than she is.

After all of the horrible Halloween remakes etc over the decades I don't know why I thought that this would be any different. They ""jumped the shark"" on this one so to speak. I mean Micheal Myers gets ran over by a car and takes a nap, meanwhile his psychiatrist/caregiver Dr. Sartain (Haluk Bilginer) secretly admires Micheal's psychosis and at one point dons the infamous Micheal Myers mask...wow!!The only salvation was seeing Jamie Lee Curtis again who gave a decent performance, but the story was soo bad I almost felt sorry for her character in this film.
Jamie plays Laurie Stroud, the true heroine of the original first two classic Halloween films. Here we see Laurie now in her early to mid 60s with some major paranoia issues (even after 40 years) and her unloving even uncaring family. Daughter Karen played by the adorable Judy Greer and granddaughter Allyson played by another overhyped millennial Andi Matichak, both characters seem unsympathetic and uncaring to Laurie's plight so I lost any empathy for their two dimensional characters.
You throw in several more worthless characters to get chopped up by Myers along the way and you have this film in a nutshell.Jamie Lee Curtis deserved better than this drivel.
She's a fine actress who will get her accolades one day. Just NO MORE Halloween remakes okay?",Halloween

Then they made Laurie Strodes character some nut job; even though she far excelled in school. How did she even afford the property she was on with all these weapons and safe rooms? She wouldn't have been that far gone from just one night of trauma. The only interesting sequence was when they visited michael at the hospital. Other than that, it was just a snooze fest with cliche & irrelevant scenes. Hard Pass If you want a sequal to the first film, just watch Halloween 2 or Halloween H20.

The 2018 version of Halloween was supposed to be the next best sequel in the franchise, but did it meet expectations?Critics and many moviegoers have said online that ""Halloween (2018)"" was the best of the franchise and a ""must see"". A return to the simplistic creepiness of the original John Carpenter film from 1978. A little late, but I finally got around to watching the latest version of Halloween starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, Will Patton, and Haluk Bilginer as Doctor Sartain the new ""Dr. Loomis"" originally played by Donald Pleasence in the 1978 version.Depending on who you talk to, ""Halloween 2018"" is the best horror film for all of 2018, for those born after 1990 and have seen just enough ""Halloween"" movies to know enough of who the characters are. True ""Halloween"" fans will look a little deeper and be more critical. Although not the worst of the ""Halloween"" films in the franchise, I was still a bit disappointed and underwhelmed with this one.Micheal Myers or The Shape whatever you want to call him has to be in his 60's by now. Twenty-four hours of mayhem murdering 13 adults 1 young boy and 3 teenagers and the guy did not even break a sweat. Each murder more gruesome than the last.

Use of the soundtrack as a narrative element, scenes in which the viewer knows more than the protagonists ...The direction and photography are more than excellent and introduce us into an atmosphere of constant helplessness, this makes that, with the exception of the first act, the tension is maintained throughout the film. The soundtrack, as opposed to current horror films, practically does not exist and only takes sides when Michael kills. It should be said that the soundtrack is based on modifications and arrangements of the original song of 1978.The film does not revolve around Michael, it revolves around Laurie's granddaughter. They present it to us as the heiress of Laurie and * spoilers * we just show that, most likely, is the heiress of Michael. *end spoilers*In short, it is a film that meets what is sought.

The film just didn't draw me in and keep me there, i kept on being taken out of it because it just wasn't engaging and things were happening all over the place with so many different people. A big twist occurred and it was over before it could develop into something interesting. At times i was frustrated or bored.The original felt realistic for this type of film, but this one had moments that made you want to scream at the screen for being so unrealistic, especially because i was expecting this to be more like the original and NOT like its campy sequels.The finale had a few seconds that i loved but that's unfortunately all the excitement i felt in this.I would say this is a movie you should go into with the mindset of watching a film that sits somewhere in the sequels, NOT with the original, and so you'll probably really enjoy it, if you really enjoyed those that is!I'm such a HUGE Danny McBride fan and i really wanted this to showcase how awesome he is, i'm just glad he wasn't the only writer attached but i'm still happy he is a reason this film has broken box office records and will go on to be one of the highest grossing Horror movies of all time! Plus it looks like half the audience loved this movie so that's great, i'm happy. Maybe in a few years when i'm doing a Halloween movie marathon i'll enjoy it more amongst the whole catalogue.The John Carpenter score to this was better than the movie, not as great as the one in the original Halloween, but I'll be buying the musical score to this film before i watch or buy the actual film for sure!6.5/10",Halloween

But, when you're trying to make a sequel to an amazing horror film that came out over 40 years ago, it's gonna be quite hard to do a good job.

492,doveed,Meeting the Standards in a Genre With Low Expectations,6,28 October 2018,"As the movie began, I thought this spin off could possibly be what CREED was to the ROCKY franchise - better filmmaking, better character development, and a fresh look at an old idea. The first half of the film is pretty much that. There's some clever cinematography and the stage is set quite well, but as the movie progresses and the killing starts, everything falls flat.Jamie Lee Curtis, who achieved legendary status because of her role in the original HALLOWEEN movie, plays a female version of John Rambo.
Forty plus years after the original nightmare, her character is traumatized from the events of the past and she is ready for warfare, as she has devoted her life to collecting guns and planning the demise of Michael Myers. This, of course, does her no good because Myers can't be killed by a bullet. Myers ultimately bites the dust when Jamie Lee Curtis finds a way to trap him in her booby-trapped basement and burn him to death...but is he really dead? We never actually see Myers go up in flames, which leaves room for a sequel which hopefully doesn't happen.With HALLOWEEN 2018, the fine filmmaking in the first half of the movie balances out the stupidity in the second half. I give it 6 out of 10 stars only because it meets the standard of what people expect from a modern day horror movie. Fans of the horror genre often have low standards for the movies they watch. As long as there is plenty of gore, laughs, and jump scares, the sub par elements get a pass. HALLOWEEN gets a pass as well, but it's not on the level of recent horror films like THE BABADOOK, IT FOLLOWS, and A QUIET PLACE, which are truly fresh and imaginative. Hopefully movies like the aforementioned cause fans to raise their standards for what they expect from a horror movie, and that filmmakers of this genre are challenged to produce better material.",Halloween

So, of course, was plowed with great hype coming in. Must admit I could see some holes. For one, I wasn't a huge fan of the Dr. turning mental in Michael's defense. If one thing Loomis did was pursue Myers relentlessly to kill, while maybe losing some marbles along the way, yet staying grounded. As a former bartender though, you sometimes lose your mind along with the mindless. But the rest is great. Gotta love the numerous references to even discarded sequels past. For the love of Jamie Lee, and you can't love her; Mike's the star. And if you want horror, he's horror. And comes out killing like he hasn't done it in like...40 years!! A well done follow up.

It could have been written in any other way and been more interesting, this is not original, risky or daring cinema, this is safe investment cinema.Always follow the money; with a small budget of $10,000,000 or nearly £8,000,000; the marketing received the most bang for its buck, with the film's trailer quickly becoming viral.
$253.7 million was netted globally at the box office, an astounding return demonstrating the compounding power of marketing and hype.In terms of sheer pre-release hype this may have been one of the most gripping titles ever. In terms of the finished package; one of the biggest letdowns ever.Michael Myers was a saving grace, a character that is hard to get wrong but was put in a boring string of predictable situations that felt too safe to be remotely fear-inducing. Nice, it's Halloween and he blends into the crowd (cool motif), but please show me a situation that is actually terrifying.Laurie Strode looked like a maniac, she was not made particularly likable and portrayed as an annoyance.
The fortress home of Strode, who had apparently spent the last forty years preparing for Michael's return, did not make me empathize with her fear when it should have.The pacing was off, the characters were mostly forgettable and not scripted memorably, few striking one-liners to take home here, let alone any memorable scenes.

It was well done on a technical level. The creepy Halloween music is still back in tact and the violence, well let's just say it's on par with the original, though more gruesome! David Gordon Green directs this version and it's a departure for him and the movies he usually directs, which are dramas and comedies. He does good on his first horror outing! Jamie Lee Curtis is back and plays her role as Laurie Strode with ease, as if she filmed the part a week after the original Halloween. She kicks ass man! There are a few issues I had with the movie that I am not going to get into detail about. The first was the Halloween dance at the high school and the second being the scene with up and comer Andi Matichak's character, Michael Myers' doctor and the cop played by Will Patton when they are riding in the police car.

Furthermore he is not that smart, he is just too strong even for a serial killer! Who cares about other franchise movie? Not every watchers is a halloween franchise fanatic. So please add real depth to your char first before you want us, audiences, start to care.",Halloween

It was more violent than I thought t would be, but still had plenty of genuine scares. There were also some funny moments.

Hell I may even say some of the other movies were better too.Awful plot, terrible twist, and a meh ending. Very predictable all around. Not scary. Tries to pay homage to the original movie with a few scenes but it's just bad.Jamie Lee Curtis's character is an awful cliche.Multiple awful scenes that should never make it to the final cut of this movie.All supporting roles are just filler/fodder for Michael to kill off, poor character development, and just meh.6 stars is being generous.Very disappointed.",Halloween
499,DylanCanonge,Halloween 2018 is a worthy successor to the original!,10,16 December 2019,"Halloween (2018) is a direct sequel to the original 1978 slasher. Which means plot from all the previous sequels, reboots and remakes throughout the years have been ignored. It's actually a really good movie imo it was one of my favorites last year, and my favorite horror movie. Halloween (2018) is way better than Halloween 2 (1981), there I said it... even if I really like the sequel of 1981. Halloween (2018) is the best made Halloween movie since the 78 original. Without forgetting that it is one of the most overtly feminist horror films of the past few years. A real success !",Halloween
500,DylanAnglin,HALLOWEEN 2018 Review,8,19 October 2018,"Halloween 2018 was definitely my most anticipated film of the year. Even though I was mildly disappointed, I won't deny that this was a good and well made film. 40 years has passed and Michael Myers has escaped. Unlike the original, Laurie Strode is prepared and ready to take on the man that tried to kill her long ago. First off, I loved the score. I would honestly go as far as saying this has the best soundtrack in the series. The music was perfect for every scene. Also, the cinematography and atmosphere was great, but didn't give me the vibe from the original. What made the movie was Michael and Laurie. Their two characters stole the show and was a blast to watch every second. With that being said, I thought some of the decisions for the movie were pointless and as much as I'd like to hate on the comedy, it was a nice addition. My main thing was the ending. I thought the ending was not good at all, but I won't get into spoilers. Halloween is a good movie, I do believe it is a worthy follow-up to the original, but it does have its flaws. 8/10",Halloween

David gordon Green does not disappoint!

504,marcusgrant-86630,Dull and Devoid of Suspense,2,29 March 2019,"You ever feel like you've seen a completely different movie than everyone else? Halloween is one of those movies for me. I missed it in theaters and, although I heard great things about it, I was a bit hesitant. After all, the Halloween series isn't exactly stellar filmmaker. Besides the original film, most of the entries in the series are incredibly flawed or silly, so I didn't have much hope for this one. Little did I know that this would probably end up being one of the worst entries in an already fairly bizarre franchise.The concept of wiping out all of the sequels is a brave and wonderful choice. After all, none of them were that great anyway, but one would think that, if a filmmaker was going to do this, they'd have something more in store than a bland, suspense-free greatest hits collection of the discarded sequels. Unfortunately, that's what this new Halloween feels like most of the time.Director David Gordon Green possesses very little style nor a sense of how to build suspense or deliver a scare. In fact, the only scene in the film that even slightly builds suspense is destroyed by unnecessary humor that kills any of the tension.Jamie Lee Curtis has returned, but gets nothing to do except play a fearless action hero, which make her Laurie Strode a strangely uninteresting character this go around. Curtis and the franchise have been here before in Halloween: H20 and, quite frankly, as flawed as that film was, Curtis and the Laurie Strode character were given much more interesting material to play with than they are here.To make matters worse, Curtis' Laurie is pushed into the background a bit too much and we're stuck with a group of all new characters who are either poorly drawn, boring, unlikable, or a mix of all three. Having such a pathetic group of characters for Michael Myers to go after also deprives the film of a lot of suspense as well. How can we root for characters we don't like, don't know, or who don't even register as humans.If there's any saving grace for this film, it's that Michael Myers finally looks and moves like Michael Myers SHOULD look and move. The sequels kept changing the mask, the build of Michael's body, and the way he moved and it's nice to finally see a Michael who seems like the same Michael from the original film. John Carpenter's score also steals the show with a nice mix of familiar themes and editing new material.Unfortunately, Halloween is a bummer of a movie. With all that potential, one would have hoped the filmmakers would have come up with something more interesting.",Halloween
505,Dorkboss,The Night He Came Home! (After 40 Years),7,21 October 2018,"The movie is said to take place after the first Halloween movie, meaning that all of the Halloween sequels are left behind the dust.The story tells that not only has Michael Myers managed to escape,but Laurie Strode is ready to go up against the boogie man.Michael Myers is great as always, especially the one the scene with the tracking shot was excellent, Laurie Strode was great as a protagonist, the tone was great and the music was awesome while it was rendition.And aside from few side character I didn't care for, Dr. Sartain character I never really found intresting.Overall I felt that this movie was a good completionist of the Halloween Franchise and hopefully nothing crazy or bizarre will ever happened in other Halloween sequel, because I kinda want this movie to end on a cliff note.",Halloween

507,simonkie,Could have been so much more,7,24 October 2018,I gave the original 1978 Halloween 10 out of 10. When I heard how this new Halloween would be a direct sequel to the original I was very excited. This movie actually has a good story but they made this movie more like a drama and not a scary thriller. First off the famous Halloween music was hardly used. The tense music you heard when Michael was creeping behind bushes and staring at houses in the original was missing. That was his music but every time he was on screen there was hardly any sound at all. Second there was no suspense to this film. Michael returns to Haddonfield after 40 years and right away starts killing random people as soon as he gets there. The whole tense buildup and stalking that made the original so terrifying was missing. Third there should have been some flashbacks to the original Halloween that showed or explained how Michael Myers was captured in the first place. Jamie Lee Curtis was great and Michael Myers did have good moments but scary it was not. They could have done so much more to make it scary but they left out the fundamentals from the first Halloween of the music and the slow deliberate stalking from Michael Myers that made the original so scary.,Halloween

514,arthurconnor,Could Stand Some Improvements,4,3 January 2020,"It took me a while to see this so that I could get away from all the hype and embrace it for what it is. Unfortunately, what that is happens to be completely devoid of suspense, scares, or real human emotion. The idea of someone like David Gordon Green tackling the Halloween saga excited me. I figured he'd bring some realistic human drama to the story, but this film's attempts to tackle the trauma of Laurie Strode are cursory at best.At least they got Michael's mask and body type right for the first time in 40 years and John Carpenter's synth score is pretty spectacular. It's nice having Jamie Lee Curtis back, but she's forced to play a Linda Hamilton action hero archetype instead of a real flesh and blood person and the big climax feels like it goes on forever without any tension.There's some good stuff sprinkled in here and there, but I can't believe people are saying this is the best sequel of the series.

This movie is boring.
It's also a big slap in the face to the fans of the original.
And course had to title it the same name as John Carpenter's masterpiece.
Now we have to say ""2018"" or ""the original"" every time we talk about Halloween.
Thank you Hollywood!You notice it in the opening scene that the script is bad:
A couple of journalists wants to speak to Michael (the killer) in a top security asylum.
For some odd reason they think that Michael is so connected to the old mask he used in 1978 so they bring it along.
The journalist man (forgot his name) holds up the mask and tries to speak to Michael. He ends up yelling and think that will help and then the famous Halloween music kicks in with the iconic ""Halloween"" title.The reason I mention this is because it makes no sense. Michael killed his sister just wearing a random mask on Halloween.
Later when he is a grown man he just finds this white mask randomly when he re-visits his town to just blend in / hide on Halloween.Basically this whole movie is pointless. We learn nothing new or have nothing to be excited about. The mystery of Michael Meyers that once were in 1978 is still unsolved. There is no point of making this sequel other than a cash grab.All of the killings happening in this movie are to characters you care nothing about. The once you do care for don't get killed. So you are just rooting for Michael and cheer him up every time he brutally kills these annoying individuals you know nothing about.They also use the Halloween theme too much in the movie. Feels more like someone is pressing play and the music starts even when it's not fitting.
Nostalgia abuse.Also for some reason many of the characters wants to speak to Michael.
He hasn't muttered a single word since 1978, so why should he now?
It was pretty much established in the first movie that he was just pure evil.
Behind those dark eyes there is nothing. Just death.
We learned that through he previous psychiatrist.If you want your Halloween fix, just watch the original. Even if you know what is going to happen it is still 10 times more exiting than this snore fest.",Halloween

519,davidkennedy-91087,Could Have Tried A Bit Harder,3,25 May 2019,"It's great that both Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter have returned this time around, but if they're going to throw all the sequels out and just resume from the original, couldn't they have thought up something more involving?The main issue with this new Halloween is that it's simply too safe. It never takes risks and offers up merely a repurposed set of flashbacks to other sequels instead of trying to come up with something new.When we're introduced to Laurie Strode this time around, she's so radically different from what she was in the '78 film that you immediately perk up and can't wait to find out how the young girl from '78 turned into this jaded, hardened, friendless, divorced mess. Unfortunately, we never get to find any of these things out, which makes Laurie a fairly one-dimensional and unlikable heroine. It doesn't help matters that she only appears sporadically throughout the film while the film tries to introduce us to a bland new group of characters who are equally underdeveloped and lacking in charm.Michael finally looks and moves like the original Michael did and John Carpenter's first time scoring a Halloween film since 1982 is worthy of celebration, but there's something missing from this movie. There's zero suspense since the filmmakers couldn't be bothered to create characters we should give a damn about and this turns the film into an endless slog of homages and reminders that you could be watching better films.",Halloween
520,jasonbourneagain,Time to Put This Boogeyman to Bed,6,31 October 2018,"If you liked the first Halloween (1978), then you'll probably like this one as it brings back Jamie Lee Curtis as Grandma Strode. It's nostalgia for Halloween. This time Laurie Strode is older, wiser and well prepared in terms of armory and panic room shelter, but she sounds very paranoid to her daughter and husband. While it is understandable that a independent woman like Strode would be this way after confronting a supernatural boogeyman during her youth multiple times, it is not understandable to her gun-hating daughter and son-in-law. Her daughter, Karen, was mistreated, i.e. abused by Mother Strode and the authorities agreed.The problem with the Halloween series has always been continuity and lack of explanation for Michael Myers. Some people think he's human like the two reporters and psychiatric doctor who treats him in this movie. There is still a lack of overall explanation as to the supernatural nature of patient Michael Myers. The first two Halloween movies labeled him as The Shape instead of boogeyman in the credits.Myers has a regular halloween mask that he broke into a store and stole, but it also seems to have supernatural powers as it doesn't get damaged even though getting hit by a tire iron and stray gun shots. Since Myers is a known danger and has these powers, as explained by Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis in the original, there should have been greater care taken in transporting Myers. He should have been moved separate in an armored vehicle and locked down with a busload of police security.There are other things that occur in the movie that are hard to explain, but it was still nostalgic for those who grew up with the Halloween series. I only saw I, II and III (no Michael) and H20. The rest were in bits and pieces and I have no recollection of those movies. There are the usual Myers scenes and killings in this one that won't disappoint the Halloween fans looking for more of the same. However, after some discussion with fans of this franchise, I think it's time to put this boogeyman to bed. There should be better boogeymen or monsters for Halloween as this one has gone stale. I gave the movie 6/10 for nostalgia and Jamie Lee Curtis returning as Grandma Strode. She did a fine acting job playing a cynical, gun-toting and survivalist grandmother who knows a monster when she meets one. Another good performance was put in by Andi Matichak who played Laurie's sympathetic granddaughter.",Halloween

526,mrlloydcopper,A very worthy tribute to this franchise,7,2 November 2018,"Having seen most of the movies of this franchise and being disappointed a number of times (basically only the first two and H20 are worthy in my opinion), I had high expectations of this movie due to the hoopla around it and of course Jamie Lee Curtis being involved, not only as an actress but as co-executive producer. Those expectations were involved.Firstly, the violence was unprecedented for this series. Myers doesn't hold back from years of incarceration that's for sure. And while I liked the series, this one was the first one that actually scared me a few times. They found the perfect balance between making a connection between the original movie (the opening credits with the original theme and font were fantastic) and making it for the new generation. All of the actors did a fine job and there were several surprise kills with a few moments of comic relief. As for whether he died....well, I suspect that it was purposefully kept open even though you'd say ""no one could make it out of that one"", this is after all part of a slasher franchise known for making the protagonist be shot, burnt and lord knows what else countless times. A good entry to the series, perhaps one of the best.",Halloween

Going back to its roots from the original with the stalking and having no real rhyme or reason to why or who Michael is stalking or killing was great (till Laurie comes in.) Where they also got it right making it more like pt 2 and 4 with more murder and gore. I'm not sure the original would have worked today the way it did in '78.What I didn't like was JLC's character. I get she's traumatized from the original but they took her trauma to a whole new level. I'm sure they'll tie why Michael is back to stalking her and her family in particular in the sequels but I hope they don't, it's one of the big reasons why the original was so good, especially before a sequel ever came out, there wasn't any reason for Michael doing what he did.",Halloween

533,ahsawesa,An Interesting Revival Of The Franchise Despite The Issues,6,22 October 2018,"I'm not a huge fan of the original. I mean it's okay, I guess. I like Michael Myers though. I haven't seen the previous sequels that followed the original.The set up is that Michael Myers has been in captivity for 40 years since the 1978 murders and Laurie Strode now is a paranoid old woman who has been preparing to fight Michael in case he escapes.. and he does and we have a Halloween movie.The story is pretty formulaic. It acts very much like a typical slasher film. But it's made with more class than some recent slasher films. It has good production value, everything looks and feels great. I mean atmosphere-wise.There's only little exploration. The film tries to raise questions that we been asking about Michael Myers but it seems very pretentious. Characters are very paper thin and some are even annoying except for Laurie and Michael who are good as always.Some people may call this sequel unnecessary. The film does not add much to the story of the original although provides a better sequel than the sequels and reboots that followed the original Halloween. I think it is warranted considering that all the previous sequels were badly received and this one is receiving praise.The acting is also just meh. Jamie Lee Curtis is good I guess but everyone else was just meh.I think what makes this film kind of work is that it turns the tropes of the Halloween franchise on their heads, it is self aware. It is the SCREAM 4 of the Halloween Franchise.There are certain plot holes or illogical things but it betrays the logic within the limits of the franchise. It doesn't break any rule that the previous Halloween films haven't.The score by Carpenter and his sons' is fantastic though.My god, that intro <3 . Nostalgia hit me like a sack of bricks even though I only saw Halloween 1978 not too many years ago.Despite the movie being just ""okayish"" , The portrayal of Michael Myers in this film is pretty damn good. He seems super pissed. The kills are very, very brutal, unforgiving and satisfying.I kind of enjoyed this more than the original because it moves at a faster pace. I was also caught off guard by the ending. I really liked the ending.Final Rating: 6.8/10. Laurie and Michael are the saving grace. It perfectly replicated the atmosphere of the original so nostalgia will work to it's advantage but this film should have been more original and better. Regardless, I still enjoyed it.

The creators of this new Halloween don't have that and the film suffers because of it. There's no reason for this film to exist. I'm not the world's biggest fan of the Halloween franchise and the idea of picking up after the original film is a great idea. The brother/sister/family angle always rang false and I certainly don't mind them doing away with it, but this film gives us no interesting or exciting reasons for revisiting these characters.Thematically, it shares many plot points with Halloween: H20, but glazes over a lot of the more potentially interesting aspects to turn Laurie Strode into your average Linda Hamilton inspired action heroine.The new batch of characters we've been given range from startlingly unlikable to wallflowers who blend in with the scenery.

The things that hold this movie back from being great is the very odd placement of MCU style humor that just doesn't work at all and can actually kill the pacing in some scenes. Although the worst part of this film is the bizarre twist that completely drops the ball even though they end up not even following the plot thread so it ends up being completely pointless. Although these flaws did not detract from my enjoyment in a major way because they are not focused on as much as the the rivalry between Micheal and Laurie which works very well.,Halloween

539,Cax019,Absolutely awful,3,19 October 2018,"First review on here, this was so bad, it was funny when it shouldn't have been, I am all up for a ridiculous horror sequel but this wasn't that. The deaths felt like nothing, no character building or effort was made for us to be interested in them. Just poor execution, not satisfying in any way",Halloween
540,dan-259-431343,SPOILER ALERT - Loved at first viewing then saw all of the flaws,2,10 February 2019,"First of all I LOVE these kind of movies so when I went to see it in the theater I had no expectation (I had not even watched a preview, which I recommend for all films before you see them) and was totally entertained. Then I bought the film and watched it again and oh dear, bless their hearts:
SPOILER ALERT
A. The story would have been better if it included Halloween 2 and just said Michael Meyers got out of the fire and was ""indestructible"". He clearly got away at the end of Halloween 1, so the story does not make sense.
B. I LOVE Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Will Patton, and Andi Matichak in the film. They were all fantastic. Virginia Gardener was also great as Allyson's best friend.
C. I HATED most of the men in the film as they were the most unappealing, poorly directed, poorly acted, and just plain stupid characters. I was insulted for Karen, Allyson, and Vicky's characters as they are strong women in the film and yet they are paired with total morons.
D. Laurie Strode's House: REALLY? If she was so prepared, then why did she have a front door with glass windows and stand in front of it so Michael could easily grab her? If Michael was in the house upstairs all the lights need to be on to see him, but Laurie turns off the lights and goes into a room filled with mannequins? Why not have a bunch of trap doors with slides that lead to the cage? The house is clearly not surrounded by security fencing as the granddaughter was able to run from the road to the house. There are a million things that could have been done to make the house more secure and yet the poor writing gives us a ""semi secure"" house that a woman like Laurie Strode would not feel safe in.
E. The film is not scary. Period.
F. The little boy who was being babysat was IRRITATING and a very poor actor.
G. I can go on and on about the stupid police.
H. Truly not a very well made film at the end of the day.",Halloween
541,peteranft,"Check the locks, Michael is lose.",8,27 October 2018,"This movie tries hard to get us to the root cause of Michael Myers evil, but Michael doesn't cooperate. I feel we are left with pure evil as the explanation, this is what we knew watching the original Halloween which is still the scariest of all the Halloween films. Why work so hard.... I was losing patience waiting for the 'MICHAEL MUSIC'. Once we got there, fantastic. Michael is one scary dude and I checked all my house locks twice before I went to bed tonight. As for the end, would Michael finally get his trip to hell? Watch it and see.... it's worth it.",Halloween
542,skywalker7471,Michael Myers Returns...,9,21 October 2018,Loved this film really gory..great suspense..some amazing shots of Myers fantastic ending..can't wait to see it again if you like the original ( who doesn't) then you will love this...,Halloween
543,jmc1969,if it wasnt for Will Patton ..,1,26 January 2019,"This movie would have sucked.. Jamie Lee is washed up, poor acting, and was the 2nd only reason to watch this movie. Michael Myers in ANY OTHER Halloween film was was this 6 foot 8 inch HOUSE of a HUGE monster. OK, In this movie he was 5 foot 6 about 175lbs of pure ""old guy"". He was gray, out of shape, no muscle and I could probably kick his a$$ with a loaf of bread. Truly pathetic.The killing spree he was on truly did not coincide with his inept, weak, substandard physical size or prowess. I dont know if this movie was a small budget or just ""made' to appear that way, but I could have made better with a camcorder--no joke..Again, I will repeat if Will Patton was not in this movie it would be not even worth watching on DVD or Redbox..And the other main cop in the movie who was Will Pattons partner I would equate to the ""crazy mailman"" in the movie Funny Farm, he looked like him, he talked like him, and the acting was horrible....It sucked, dont watch it, dont waste your life or 2 hours on a movie that should have been a blockbuster that truly sucked balls. Its not even worth renting, take my advice.",Halloween
544,maisyskinner,Anemic Sequel,4,11 October 2021,"Michael Myers has been in custody for 40 years since his Halloween night massacre that left teenage babysitter, Laurie Strode, a mental wreck. On the night he's set to be transfered to another asylum, he escapes and returns to Haddonfield, but Laurie's spent the last 40 years planning for this exact thing.For all this talk about this sequel taking things back to its roots and making the franchise scary again, it sure isn't very frightening. Dialogue and characters usually seem strained and unconvincing, leaving the actors to try to do all the heavy lifting, especially Jamie Lee Curtis who has been saddled with what is perhaps the worst variation on Laurie Strode we've seen to date. She's stone cold and stoic without much variation or that relatable vulnerability we loved so much in the original film and even some of its sequels. On the plus side, Michael Myers is portrayed in a threatening light again and John Carpenter's music score gives the film more atmosphere than it deserves.",Halloween
545,ardentayu,Honors the old; brings in the new,8,1 November 2019,"This will not disappoint fans of the original, but you can appreciate this movie with only a basic understanding of the back story. Jamie Lee Curtis's character has plenty of depth in this story (unlike the original, where she's just a scream queen). Her conflicted relationship with her daughter and granddaughter give this story both heart and dark humor. Plenty of scares, creepiness, and gores, but it's also smart.",Halloween

Believe me when I say that I WANTED TO LOVE THIS.Sadly, it's a generic piece of trash with filmmaking that is inept. My first tip off was buying the soundtrack, listening to it and realizing it's a ""greatest hits"" album. Very little new. I guess that's what people wanted, maybe?The ONLY thing I found redeemable was Jamie Lee Curtis, who was wonderful.This film succeeded because of nostalgia pure and simple. It wasn't because it was good, trust me. Inconsistent characters, terrible pacing and directed with an awkward, ham fisted effort. There are LEGIONS of people who will love this, but those hoping to forget the sequels (esp. Rob Zombie) and hope against hope that this may return to its roots will be very let down.",Halloween

550,mcancea,best Halloween in years but disappointing,7,5 November 2018,Halloween is back with jamie lee curtis and she is back and is a direct sequel so non of the other ones exist except for the first and is disappointing but a good film. a lot of the characters were very disappointing in this film not many i cared for except Lorie and a character that was hilarious in this film. this film starts with Lorie getting prepared for years to kill Michael Myers and Michael has escaped yet again and he starts killing everybody on Halloween 40 years later. dr lunis is dead so his student is the new one dr.sartain and he was garbage he didn't do anything good. they could have made the story more interesting and way better. Lorie at the end has a battle with Michael and its a great finale and it is thrilling but it is overall disappointing for me to be honest but it is a fun time but not great.,Halloween
551,coolbreezera,looked promising but then it failed big time,5,1 November 2018,To make a long story short ...it started off good the first 15 minutes off the movie though the build up was great and for a brief moment it looked like they actually put in some time to build up a decent final Halloween movie.But after watching 15 minutes of the movie it simply became to predictable even if you never watched Halloween before never heard of it ..it would still be a major let down !,Halloween

553,jeymatt,Overrated,4,31 October 2018,Why so high ratings? I sincerely feel it's overrated. Not at all scary for a slasher horror film. And it's boring too. Hell Fest was a much better slasher film than this one.,Halloween
554,vukaroo,MEH,5,21 October 2018,"So, sure, we just got another installment in the Halloween franchise after nearly a decade, but was it necessary? I'm not so sure...First of all, I think David Gordon Green and Danny McBride did a great job together on Vice Principals and they definitely have a flair for humor. I could see how Blumhouse could have wanted the pair to approach a coveted horror series and infuse it with comedic elements, to give it a modern, B-movie feel, but they missed the mark somewhere along the road. I personally don't see what the intent was.Sadly, I feel this film kind of falls in the same category as a lot of reboots/ sequels of present, in the sense that it tries too hard to pay homage to the past. I will admit that it was initially creepy and kind of cool that Michael was being visited in the asylum, but once his escape from the bus took place, the movie started to go a bit downhill. One of the biggest problems that I had with the film were the characters. I'm not saying the characters were particularly complex in H1 (1978) or H2 (1981), but they worked in the context of those films because the product felt more immersive. I honestly didn't care for anyone in this new film, or their fate for that matter. I couldn't blame Michael for his arbitrary approach to annihilation.All in all, it just wasn't very good. The moment you're uncertain if a film should be horror or comedy is not a good sign. I can add that the script was a bit of a mess as was the editing. Also, all of the blatant references to the other films feels like a trip to the museum; here we have the Myers mask, and here we have the rumor that Laurie was Michael's sister...In my opinion, I'd stick to H2 (1981) as a proper sequel to the original film. Between the 1978 classic and the 81 continuation, you're actually under the impression that Michael Myers is truly evolving from a human into a supernatural monster.Ultimately, there were some ok elements in the new Halloween, but Michael Myers truly belongs to the horror film zeitgeist of the late 70s/early 80s.",Halloween

I went to see it and Liked it the plot seemed to fit with the dynamics of the movie the kills where amazing some caught me off guard but I loved. I just have say one thing Jamie lee Curtis is a badass seriously she is just wanna say that. Also it seems these new gen horror movies seems a bit non scary just saying. So to some it all up Halloween 2018 gets a 8-10,Halloween
556,snyperbladeaq,Cheap scares and so obvious,4,14 August 2019,"So cringe worthy at some points. Like why why why would you do this. So your quick enough to run up the stairs from Michael but all off a sudden michael grabs your leg. You see Michael one side of the gate and instead keeping quiet and running away you have scream with full volume for him to chase you. You hide in a well secured basement but instead hiding you shoot the wood and create a bigger hole, you know Michael is at the other side of the door and you have to stand near the door which has glass panes... gaaaahhhh nonsense.

Is very difficult to create a new mystery using the same characters/location, that didn't appear, as just a copy of the first. The first movie, like many great films, left audiences craving more; however recreating an amazing mystery from the same cloth would require a very creative idea, of which the movie industry seems to have a dearth at this time.

559,Watcher42,Disappointing Home Alone sequel,3,22 December 2018,"Solid performances all round, but ultimately this adds nothing to the Halloween series or slasher films in general. There isn't a single reason to watch this over the original. This is a well trod road we are heading down here.Think of the most obvious way they could tell this story... Congratulations, you are at least as talented as the writers who got paid for this.Slow, boring and lacking surprises. It's hard to care about characters when they are as so thinly written they may as well be labelled Daughter, Granddaughter, Son-in-law, Boyfriend, Police Chief, Babysitter etc rather than have actual names.I can't help but think that the writers spent too much time focussing on how they could continue the strong female story thread from the original instead of trying to write interesting character arcs. In the original Laurie was a vulnerable character who became a survivor. The audience had sympathy and empathy for her. We willed her to survive. Jamie Lee Curtis was an incredibly strong female lead. The writers seem to have decided to really drive this strong female message home. All the men are buffoons who are easily dispatched while Laurie and the females in her family take on Michael with comparative ease. At times Laurie just comes across as tougher than Arnie taking on the Predator, and Myers comes across as an impotent lumbering oaf. It feels ham-fisted when it could have been a brilliant 'passing of the torch' to Laurie's grand daughter.It's a shame this film is so disappointing as the first 10-15 minutes appear to be leading to an interesting set up. But no, the return of Michael and his rampage is so painfully telegraphed and uninspired - I can't even call it fan service. The middle of the film sags horribly under its own weight. Then we devolve in to Home Alone territory for the big finale. We learn barely anything about the world these characters exist in, so it raises the question... Why bother making it?",Halloween
560,MarkoutTV,Can't Believe They Pulled This Off (One Minor Spoiler),9,21 October 2018,"(There is one minor spoiler here that does not involve the ending sequence of the film or the main portion of the plotline. It's still a satisfying moment when you don't know it's coming however, so be warned)Well this was all kinds of dope.The trap that most horror movie sequels fall in is that they try to ""explain"" the villain. Dive into their backstory, learn more about who they were as kids, what made them turn to a life of crime and ultimately learn how can this be used to defeat them now. You know what the problem with that is? It NECESSARILY makes the villain less scary when you peel back their characterization as ""evil monster"" and change it to ""damaged kid"".The beginning of this movie teases that it's going to fall into this trap as we meet reporters who are trying to explain Michael Myers, humanize him, and find out what his triggers are. I began the film worried that this was the rout the movie was gonna take, but instead you know what happens to those reporters? They get murdered. Michael murdered the crap out of them. He murdered their asses, brutally and beautifully. It was in that moment that I knew this film was in the hands of people that knew what made Michael Myers scary. Michael Myers isn't a little boy looking for his mommy's approval. He's a barely human killing machine. This point is further proven with a very satisfying kill later on.The other trap a lot of horror sequels fall in is a certain shift from dramatic tension to over the top action and violence. The original Halloween is a movie that exemplified doing more with less. Since it had roughly the budget of a ham sandwich, it succeeded with outstanding direction, storytelling and tension building, and less with special effects and action. Now that Halloween is an established name of course, it stood to reason that this film might overdo it with the big action scenes and stunning effects associated with having actual money to spend, but forget to actually remember the strength of the Halloween franchise.This film masterfully avoids this trap as well. When Myers is back in town on the 31st, it feels like a true update of the original, the proverbial ""Halloween on a budget"". There are more kills, more gore and more neat camera tricks. While cool, if the movie kept it here it would have felt like a good but slightly less scary retread of the original. However, instead after they get this classic Halloween goodness out of the way, the climax of the film takes place not in town, but a more claustrophobic location. And here the tension is cranked up to 11. This genius move gave the audience the best of both worlds: the original Halloween with modern flavor, yet maintaining sequences of palpable tension and fear.The most succinct, and the best thing I can say is that we have a horror movie sequel here that truly ""gets"" what made the original great and created a film that respects it while not feeling like a retread. The characters make sense and their actions and motivations are fully consistent with their original portrayals. The acting, particularly from Jamie Lee Curtis was top notch and even 40 years later I wound up fully satisfied and buying into this as a true continuation of the Halloween story. It avoids the traps that plague most horror sequels and delivers a film that is entertaining, engrossing and best of all, scary.It is, quite simply, one of the best horror movie sequels of all time.",Halloween
561,somlaign1,"Glad they're staying more true to Halloween I & II, but could be scarier.",8,23 October 2018,"This is a great movie overall but it still doesn't quite live up to it's predecessors, Halloween I & II. In Halloween I, Michael was seen stalking Laurie and for the most part, he was very elusive, almost like a figment of your imagination. There was something so creepy about his calm but relentless demeanor. And at times when he got up from a wound it was slow and approaching and seeing him in the background behind Laurie being so unaware made it so tense. This one seems to ignore all that and just goes straight to the kills with no tension or buildup in between, no savoring the moment leading up to it. But overall, it's an enjoyable movie if you're a Michael Myers fan.",Halloween

That should be reserved for horrible movies like Super Mario Bros, Movie 43, Freddy Got Fingered, etc.I will agree on one thing that keeps being brought up by the negative reviewers: it lacks the suspense that made the original so special. That doesn't mean there isn't suspense, but it comes in spurts (such as the bus scene and the gas station scene) and lacks consistency. I also agree that the characters are unlikable and have very little depth. They could have developed the characters much more while staying in the hour and 45 min runtime.The feel of the movie is profound. It truly feels like a genuine Halloween film. The kill scenes, the ""personality"" of Michael, the pacing and intensity all help support the movie, making it easy to look past its occasional flaws.It's hard to imagine true fans of the series and horror fans in general don't find this movie to be, at the very least, enjoyable and engaging.It is easily in the top 3 movies in the series of 12.",Halloween

566,funnygy,"Better than most of the sequels, but still unnecessary.",6,21 October 2018,"When I read that John Carpenter was working on a new ""Halloween"" film, it seemed like both good news and bad news. On one hand, it seemed like if anyone could finally bring something new to the ""Halloween"" saga, it was the man who started it all. On the other hand, it seemed doubtful that even Carpenter could breathe new life into such a stale, beating-a-dead-horse franchise after all these years.It is very much the case that this new ""Halloween"" comes closer than any of the previous sequels to matching the original film's vision. The new film is a direct sequel to the original, and all the convolutions and contrivances of the other follow-ups have been jettisoned; i.e., Laurie is no longer Michael's sister. (This last point was particularly refreshing to this reviewer, as John Carpenter himself has said that he came up with it just to have some reason to keep the story going in ""Halloween II."" Carpenter was already so tired of Michael that when pressed into doing a third entry, he tried to abandon the slasher formula altogether and turn the series into an anthology. The result was the criminally underrated ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch."")The problem here is that, even with a clean slate, there just isn't anywhere new to go. We've seen all of this before, many times over. Apart from a few nice touches and clever homages to the original film, 2018's ""Halloween"" is little more than a paint-by-numbers affair. As fun as it is to see a new entry in this franchise that so closely honors its source, you could get the same feelings by just watching the original film and enjoying it again.",Halloween

This is a great tables-turned, multilayered psychological approach to despair and survivalism. The humor and natural acting by the teens kept us attached to 1978's quirky film. It was definitely not a scare. However, there are three reasons for not receiving a 10:
1) Two unnecessary scenes of gore despite homage to certain sequels,
2) The integration of keeping us in the present by using a sub-par podcast crew, and

He killed so many people in a short period of time, which took away from the buildup. Side note, did anyone else hate the father's character? He was over the top, unrealistically annoying.

I won't go into more detail cuz I don't want to spoil it. I, too, actually felt bad when he killed the people...the veil of horror movie anesthesia dropped away and my empathy kicked in.

581,Drago1995,It's better than H20 but....,6,28 October 2018,"First disappointment. I know why they ignored the second movie but i still would want it to have stayed in this timeline even if i liked Halloween 4 it would have been fine for me if they had ignored the Jamie timeline and just stayed with H1 and H2 it would have given Michael a much higher kill count in 1978 to me it would just give a more sense of he he is nothing to mess with he is dangerous.Second Disappointment. It's 2018 of course they are gonna push the strong females and all that feminist bs, some if not most of the men characters are portrayed has jerks.Third Disappointment. i find it super cringy that they keep doing references to old originals it's fine when done once ore twice but all the time that's just a cash grab to make people feel nostalgic and make them think it's good because references to the original.Forth Disappointment. i love they remixed a bit the old soundtrack but i hate the added new ones it felt like H20 all over again with the soundtracks of Scream than Halloween.overall i will watch it again and will buy the DVD later when it comes out but with a bit of disappointment.",Halloween

584,mrmystery99,Very Very Impressive,8,11 October 2021,"So this film has obviously been out for a while now and I was aware of it back when it originally came out but the rating on here kind of talked me out of watching it.Terrible mistake on my part! This film is excellent.I'm really glad I decided to watch this because wow what a fun chilling horror film. The original Halloween is a very special film for a lot of reasons. It's a classic, low budget, simple, very effective horror film made by a director with a great understanding of creating cinematic tension. In a lot of ways, this sequel is the exact same. It's very straightforward in a lot of ways. As it should be.Michael is back. He will kill everyone who can't escape him.Something that really impressed me was just how much I cared for the expendable characters. I mean, I knew going in that I shouldn't get attached to anyone because they'll most likely be dead within 5 minutes of them being on screen. Still, I found myself caring for the background characters more, definitely than Laurie because I knew she would be in the sequel. Damnit.However, Michaels very first kill sets the stage that's there's nothing off limits in this film and anyone could be next. Apart from Laurie I genuinely felt bad for the compassionless way Michael killed innocent people. That babysitter and that poor horny guy who gets impaled on a gate were more deeply written characters than I ever expected and all the actors did very well in creating believable chemistry together.The camera work in this film was perfect too. You can tell the director understood the assignment when it came to replicating the work Carpenter did in the original. Some of the tension created in this film is undeniably awesome. That one single frame kill, where it starts with Michael's reflection in the window followed by watching him walk around to the back of the house and stab the woman inside. Simply exquisite and exactly what I wanted to see (yikes).From my experience, SO many terrible run of the mill cash grab horror movies get released every year and I expected this film to be just that - but I was wrong. This film was made with a lot of care and consideration to the original and I really respect it in a lot of ways. The sequel to this film Halloween Kills is just about to be released and I'm defo watching that. Ignore the rating (currently 6.5 wtf) and watch this film.",Halloween

The only place it's easier to guess which characters are going to live and which are going to die would be the red vests in Star Trek. If you pick an annoy stereotype, stoner, babysitter, geeky friend, chances are they'll be a kebab a few minutes later.Michael Myers retains his invincibility. Smacked full bore in the face with a crowbar? Nothing. Run over? Back up and running in a couple of minutes. Shot once in the shoulder? No visible affects. Shot in the face? Fingers amputated, etc etc. It takes the whole thing beyond the realm of believability.The first Halloween film was so groundbreaking mainly because when he lost the mask at the end, Myers was a regular person. Even though he was a monster, he could be anyone.

587,Skaigear,"Halloween will satisfy those who are looking for a fun, jump scare-filled movie, as well as those who are looking for intense, arthouse horror",10,19 October 2018,"Halloween is directed by David Gordon Green and co-written by Danny McBride. It is the 11th movie of the significant horror franchise, which is by far my favorite of all the horror franchises. The first Halloween and each subsequent follow ups all hold a place, some more special than others, in my heart, yes, even Season of the Witch and the Rob Zombie movies. But this entry is something else entirely. Not only to me is it the best Halloween sequel, I also believe it is the best Halloween movie, the best slasher movie and one of the best horror movies of all time. Period.The movie takes place 40 years after the original movie, ignoring all sequels in between. While this is not the first time they have done that, in fact this is the fourth alternate timeline in the series, this time however I believe they got it right. In a storyline reminiscent to Halloween H20, the main difference being instead of having Laurie Strode running away from her past, this time she is prepared for it, as the 40 years past has her spent honing her battle skills to ready herself for Michael's impending return.Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode here gives a terrific performance that is rare among horror movies; more akin to a serious drama. Curtis is believable and nuanced, allowing the film to ground itself into a level of realism, divorcing itself from the goof and lunacy from earlier entries like The Curse of Michael Myers and Resurrection. Curtis is the backbone of the film and without her giving it 110 percent, the movie could have faltered and not worked at all.Thanks to the grounded performances and direction, Michael Myers this time around feels much more menacing. Since the victims he kills feel way less like cannon fodders like in typical slasher movies, the overall tone of the character is darker and more mean-spirited. While still having some slasher tropes, the characters in the film feel more real than ever, so when scary moments hit, I genuinely wanted them to survive, but only for my heart to sink, when they bite the dust in the bloodiest, most disgusting, brutal way.Michael Myers is a horror icon, but he has not been frightening since the original. As the series went on, he became a generic masked killer at best and laughable at worst. The reason for that is because the sequels simply do not know how to frame him. Ask yourself what makes someone scary? Absolutely not when you explain away his curse with Thorn and turn him into a hitman for a cult, or recount his white trash family backstory. None of that. Here he is just a highly resilient, deranged man, who lacks morals and empathy, and preys on one of mans' primal fears - at any moment someone can break into your house and murder you for no reason and with no remorse.The best scene of the movie is a tracking shot where we follow Michael through the neighborhood, breaking into people's houses and murdering them in the grisliest way. The camera, the tension, the lighting, the kills all make it one of the best horror scenes of recent memory. And the final showdown between Laurie and Michael was cathartic and satisfying, having been built up throughout the entire film.As for negatives, I kind of wished they show more of the holiday of Halloween. Yes, we get a Halloween dance and background scenes of children trick or treating, but something the past movies did absolutely right was capturing the spirit of the holiday that I felt this movie kind of just skimmed through. I wanted more walks through the autumn foliage and perhaps even a scene at a costume shop would have been appreciated.With Laurie and Michael both working as characters for their different respective reasons, the rest of the technical aspect of the film is equally brilliant. The writing, directing and music (of which John Carpenter returned for) are all top-notch. Halloween 2018 is the best movie of the series for me, topping even the original because of the much more menacing nature of Michael Myers. The movie is a slash far above the rest of horror movies of the same vein. Halloween will satisfy those who are looking for a fun, jump scare-filled movie, as well as those who are looking for intense, arthouse horror.",Halloween

It takes some good fight/action scenes from 'Halloween H20'. Also, it is gory like Rob Zombie's 2007 reboot, but not too much to reach NC-17. The rest of the remaining entries, like 'Halloween: Resurrection"", deserve to be dismissed.Jamie Lee Curtis is a total knock-out this time! She probably has revived as many times as Michael Myers. Her comeback in this film reminds us why she's one of the ultimate scream queens. Even when the story isn't exceptional, it is exciting to go back to Haddonfield for a good 'last' scare. Fans will not be disappointed and new audiences will be surprised. This film is like a good roller coaster ride. It's intense, frightening and fun. So far, it is one of the best horror films of 2018.

591,adamoctranspo,Halloween does a lot right and a bit too much wrong,7,27 October 2018,"Halloween (2018) had me excited and really into the film for the first 30 mins. After that it kind of falls apart by too many primary characters steering the plot in different directions and tones.Despite great acting, I really did not like the dialogue the Danny McBride attempted to improve. The small chats about dance class, clipping toe nails didn't work at all.The kills are legit, there's at least 12, probably closer to 20. A lot of it is off screen but they pan back to show the gore or aftermath. Some of this is effective, other deaths don't make sense.Finally the element that brought this film down a notch is the ""twist"". I won't say what it is but thankfully the movie doesn't completely ruin itself.Last 20 mins are good. Great suspense, tough ladies dishing out revenge!

593,bora_mustafa,"Has its moments, but ultimately a disappointing Halloween movie!!",2,3 December 2018,"Halloween (2018) is a movie that was so hyped up, it was a movie that I honestly couldn't wait to see. After the 2 very weird Rob Zombie directed Halloween movies, I was ready to be back on track. I mean ""what could go wrong?"" John Carpenter returning for the Score, Jamie Lee Curtis returning as Laurie Strode and Michael Myers looking as badass as ever (love the updated look of the mask).Unfortunately a lot also went wrong with this movie. Before I start with the negatives, let me mention the good. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as ever, she really adds more to her character of Laurie Strode, Nick Castle (The original ""Shape"") reprising Michael in certain scenes did a great job, I love the updated Halloween theme. Some of the early scenes were done very well, I loved the scene with the reporters showing Michael his mask and everyone going insane around him.However it is a not a perfect Halloween movie at all. There are too many unnecessary characters thrown into this movie (such as the useless cops), some of them just feel like stock characters, and there are some characters who show up and then disappear from the movie without any resolve. The Doctor Sartain character for instance, completely unneeded and I feel the character didn't really add anything to the movie. The ending to the movie was also very disappointing. In addition to that, the movie just isn't scary, lack of atmosphere, not one scene made me jump.But above all that, the biggest flaw I feel this movie has is its continuity of its story. Let me iterate: the story is meant to be a continuation of the first movie, basically ignoring every single movie except the original. This here is the biggest problem, I feel this movie would have benefited if the story just continued from Halloween H20 (1998) instead of ignoring all the other films. The problem here is the believability, are we meant to believe that Laurie has been preparing for 40 years waiting for Michael all this time? It just seems lazy.As mentioned, it does have its moments but these are few and far between. The movie should have just been about Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. It's not a bad film, it's a lot better than most of the sequels, although it cannot match the first, second and even the fourth Halloween movie which I find superior to this.",Halloween

600,Reelnerd,The Shape Returns!,9,22 October 2018,"Reel Nerd Review: Halloween
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Director: David Gordon Green
Starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Judy Greer, Andi Matichak, James Jude Courtney, Nick Castle, Haluk Bilginer, Will Patton
The Shape returns forty years later erasing countless sequels and and a Rob Zombie reboot from the creators behind Pineapple Express, David Gordon Green and Danny McBride who is well known for his comedic chops. This film picks up with Michael Myers having been locked up for forty years in an institution following his killing spree in Haddonfield back in 1978.
Green and McBride return Michael to his roots as a soulless, unstoppable and unsympathetic killing machine. Even as a fan of the Zombie Halloween films what bothered me about them was his deconstruction of evil. He felt the need to humanize and make Michael a sympathetic character that if you couldn't root for that you could at least understand. In doing so he robbed the character of his mystique and made him (in my opinion) a much less terrifying character.
I remember the chills I felt as young boy watching the original Halloween which still holds up these forty years later. The magic of the original is recaptured in this modern take on the franchise. Laurie Strode (Curtis) is essentially the ""Dr. Loomis"" of this piece even though she refers to another character by that moniker who really isn't.
This Halloween film is essentially the horror version of Terminator 2 with Laurie Strode as a badass mama bear who will stop at nothing to protect her family from the onslaught that is Michael Myers. She has learned how to defend herself by becoming an expert marksman and making her home a virtually impenetrable fortress.
The years have not been kind to Laurie as she has suffered through a lot, two failed marriages and a strained relationship with her daughter and granddaughter. In the way that Rob Zombie tried to get into the mind of evil Green and McBride look at the impact of violence and trauma upon the victims of evil and quite effectively in my opinion.
Earlier this year at San Diego Comic-Con Jamie Lee Curtis effectively equated Laurie's struggles in the film to the current MeToo movement in Hollywood. After watching this film it is understandable why she chose to make the comparisons. Laurie questions the motivations of a couple of documentaries in the film in trying to get inside Michael's psyche. He kills because he can end of story in her opinion. I have to wonder if maybe that was some kind of dig at Zombie's take on Halloween and The Shape.
Another thing I thought this film did better than Zombie's film is dialogue. Particularly dialogue among the teenage characters in the film. In Zombie's films I felt the dialogue among the younger characters were cheesy and disingenuous. It literally felt like a forty year old man's belief of how teenagers talk and act as opposed to how they actually do.
Even though some of the characters in the film have a sparing mount of screen time the filmmakers still took the time to make the supporting as well as the lead characters feel and act real. When these characters in the film died you felt for them, some more than others. There is only one death in the film that seemed ""deserved"" but I won't spoil that for you in my review.
Michael's present day attending physician Dr. Sartain claims to be an apprentice of Dr. Loomis and is referred to as the new Loomis by Strode. He is anything but in fact he is the anti-Loomis. Whereas Loomis wanted to contain and eliminate the evil Dr. Sartain has a different obsession with Michael altogether. Dr. Sartain is obsessed with what makes Michael tick, what fuels his actions and what part does Laurie play in that equation. He is also curious to know what drives Laurie in terms of her own obsession with Michael. Sartain becomes overcome by the very evil that he sought out to understand. I wonder if agan this might be a jab at Rob Zombie.
I loved Halloween 2018 because the filmmakers seemed to really understand the character and what made the original film in the franchise work. They understand it in a way that those behind the sequels and Rob Zombie didn't. Myers, The Shape is like a shark running on brutal instinct alone. What makes him frightening is not why he chooses to kill but because you don't know why.",Halloween

602,notaprincess9,Does Michael sniff his sister from miles away?,5,30 October 2018,"I was excited to see this film and I have to say I liked the first minutes of its duration. The buildup was slow and atmospheric and I enjoyed the fact that he didn't start killing right off the bat and 10 people per minute. BUT..If I'm correct Michael doesn't have any supernatural abilities, does he? If so, why does he never die ffs. He had his hand shot, lost fingers and plenty of blood, he was stabbed multiple times, his face was also shot, a car had run him over but he still found the strength to fight back? Oh come on. A little realism never hurt anyone..And how is it that he knows who his sister is since he hasn't seen her in 40 years? How does he even know her daughter and granddaughter? Don't tell me he knows how to use a PC and found her on facebook!Why didn't he kill the infant in the first house he entered? Why did he wait in the closet for so long before attacking the blonde? Why didn't he hurt the boy she babysat? We've seen he is ruthless and doesn't even care about those who haven't hurt him *psychologists, guards, his own family* so I don't think he spares the kids..He is the most predictable serial killer ever and police know where he's headed yet they only have two policemen outside the residence, who of course are very dumb and not focused...And the family is also very stupid. Instead of catching a flight to Hawaii, they decide to lock up inside the house they know he'll visit searching for them. Yeah, I get it she wanted him dead so she stayed to trap him. But if she was that afraid of him and wanted her family to be safe, she would realistically go very far away and have the police trap him inside the house...But that wouldn't be interesting for the movie, would it..",Halloween

605,CinderFall,Best sequel,8,22 October 2018,"No it's nowhere near as good as the first movie, but it sure as hell is better than everything that came after. Good characters, great kills, and a story that makes sense (here's looking at you, Halloween 6). Curtis does a great job of building up her paranoia throughout the movie while also keeping that feel of the Laurie Strode we all know and love (that also made a comeback in H20). This movie is an indefinite film. I can almost guarantee a sequel is in the works. Does that mean the new Halloween 2 is bad? Hell no! In fact, I'll go as far as to say this is the best sequel to ever come out of this franchise. It felt really hand-in-hand with the original while also distancing itself by handling the deaths very differently. Halloween (2018) is a fantastic entry to the series and strongly deserves the praise it has received.",Halloween
606,payupyou,Well worth the 40 year wait!,10,2 December 2018,"I was 14 when Halloween came out. I've watched all of the films in the franchise hundreds of times. Still don't agree that III had anything to do with the storyline irrespective of the claims that the silly toy company was using a jack-o-lantern image to carry itself as part of the franchise.
Jamie Lee has had an ""adequate"" career. She's not a great actress nor is she a bad actress. Her fame stems from Carpenter's vision and has pretty much carried her throughout the years.
Jamie is extraordinary in this film. The pain she's endured, the fear she's lived with most of her life is so well shown in every move she makes. She shows us the same fear as she did 40 years ago and does it so well. If you freeze any frame she's in you can see pain and suffering and fear.
There are a few twists I hadn't counted upon. I intentionally steered clear of all reviews and 'net sneak peaks. As I said I've been awaiting this closure like the rest of us, for 40 years.
A life-long student of the horror genre which seems saturated with crap these days. Torture isn't horror it's just another means by which to make people squirm. But when you're invested in the characters you feel their pain and that's what separates true classic horror from most of the garbage to come out of Hollywood lately - don't mistake what I'm saying, there are some great films coming out but the horror film industry as a whole has got to put the brakes on a bit and let us crave a good film in the way Hannibal craves human flesh. Make us wait until we can't stand it anymore and THEN pop out a really great story with actors that aren't afraid to be dramatic and a story that engages you so you're still thinking about it a month later.
Carpenter and the other greats have all shown us what a real horror film is - it's something that could as easily happen next door as it could down the street or in your own home. And it can keep happening over and over. This for me is the true art form of the horror film.
I'm not a critic, but not too many films get past me - maybe so many they seem to run together at times. This film is a classic. It puts closure to one of the first and finest horror franchises to ever grace the screen.",Halloween

Do not believe the hype this is a very low quality low budget horror movie. Without the Halloween name attached it would sink without a trace its one of the worse horror movies made in quite some time & a terrible waste of time.1: Deeply unlikeable characters & the actors playing them do not generate any interest.
2: Confusing, lifeless plodding story. Could easily have been 30 mins shorter.
3: One of the worse Halloween sequels if not the worse.
4: Dumb Michael Myers kills with minimal gore & shot to minimise any impact (so they can get PG13 on PPTV most likely).
5: Very poorly directed & edited with no interesting locations, setups or camerawork.
6: So poorly conceived, acted, & edited.If you want to see a decent Halloween movie go back to the 1978 original (now on 4K UHD) or even Halloween 3 (1982) on Bluray. Both are excellent even Halloween 2 (1981) Bluray is way more entertaining.This is a failure on every single level. The amount of box office it generated in N America (ONLY) is staggering.

Why not do one last sequel while you still had Donald Pleasance around and Jamie Lee looking good? These films were driven by Donalds performance as Dr. Loomis and you can see the whole left without him.
So, here we have past his prime JC caving into making another Halloween. It is basically a pale remake of the 1st. No Loomis, a scraggly Jamie lee Curtis with a bunch of no name actors.The 1st half is decent and there are a couple of good kills but where the theme music went I do not know. Even when the credits roll there is no Halloween theme. What was the point of having JC do the music? Why are half the kills off screen? Don't go into it expecting a blockbuster. It is a better than average sequel done half a**.",Halloween

622,StrifeLeeSimpson,The 'Requel' Film Done Right,9,24 November 2019,"It took a paradox for the concept of this film to work. The original Halloween was easily the best film in the series, but it would not have been a famous horror franchise without it's inferior successors. But this would not have worked if it wasn't a big horror franchise. So this movie needed all the sequels so they could ignore them. It should not have worked, but it did. The original created all the horror tropes we know today without knowing it at the time. Many horror films followed the same pattern for slasher flicks but this film was able to take the tropes it created and do something completely original. It took its original score which was never truly expanded upon in the other films, and created something even better. It didn't feel predictable and turning it into a thriller was a good move. We got to see Michael more than in any other, which should not have worked, but it did. It kept true to the original concept of The Shape while still being able to reinvent the character, or lack there of. The idea of him being a mindless killing embodiment of evil is much more scary than being obsessed with killing his last remaining family members, which every single sequel and reboot film relied heavily on. This is an example of the over-saturated sequels, reboots and prequel phase of cinema being done right. Any concept can get over done but it is movies like these of which this concept was made for.",Halloween
623,GaryKurt101,The Return of Laurie Strode,5,28 October 2018,"I've been a Halloween fan for as long as I can remember. I saw it late one night at a sleepover at age 8 and fell in love with the film. To me, the sequels were never quite the same (even though some were better than others). I was pleasantly surprised when I heard David Gordon Green had signed on to make a sequel that would get rid of all that useless clap trap, bring back Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, and return to the suspense and thrills of the original film.Well, he did two of those things.This new Halloween starts off with a bizarre prologue involving two British investigative journalists interviewing Michael Myers at a mental hospital. They've, somehow, managed to track down his original mask and they think it's a good idea to taunt him with it in front of his face. Before we know it, we're right into the familiar jack 0' lantern opening credits (which appear to be CGI?) as a crushed pumpkin inflates itself back to life and smiles that familiar grin we're so used to. It's an interesting idea, but the credits make little impact as they feel like someone's accidentally sat on the remote and pressed the fast forward button.In fact, the rest of the film feels like it's been sped up and not given a chance to really build the characters and stretch out the dramatic moments. Laurie Strode now lives in seclusion in a ratty old shack and she's none to please when these journalists come knocking on her door. Y'see, Laurie already knows that Michael is being transfered to another facility, because she's been hoping he's escape for 40 years so that she can finally kill him.Curtis is wonderful here with a wild lion's mane of grey hair and a determined spirit. She does what she can with the material, but it never quite rises to her level. There are moments where the film seems like it's about to let her really rip, but then, it abruptly cuts away to something else, robbing Curtis' performance of a lot of power. There's a wonderful scene where Curtis is alone in her car, waiting for Michael to be transfered that could use a good minute to breathe. Similar is a scene almost directly after where she crashes a dinner for her granddaughter and ends up breaking down. There's something not fully baked about these scenes and it's a shame, because Curtis seems more willing than ever to take those big, dramatic leaps.The main issue in this film is lack of suspense. Many potentially suspenseful moments are undercut by poor moments of humor that fall flat more often than not. It also doesn't help that our new batch of victims (including Laurie's daughter and granddaughter) are about as developed and interesting as a packet of Mentos. Some still manage to give game performances, but without any meat on their character's bones, it's all in vain. We simply just don't care about them or what happens to them and that undercuts a lot of the suspense.There's also a completely useless character of a doctor who's supposed to be a Loomis stand in and he's involved in one of the dumbest moments I've seen in years. Truth be told, he could have been written out completely and the film would be all the stronger for it.On the plus side, Curtis turns in a game performance, John Capenter's music score (his first time to score a sequel since '82's Halloween III) is brilliant, the cinematography is great, and Michael hasn't been this scary since the early 80's. It's just a shame that so much doesn't quite work. It's merely adequate when it should soar.",Halloween
624,rhomulas,Great Sequel,8,2 November 2018,"The negative reviews this movie is getting really does show the lower IQ people from the high, this movie is has been thought out properly, the characters are cast well, Michael is on a mission to find Laurie like the original, the music, John carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis produces this like a gem. I was surprised just how good it is.A must see for Halloween fans!!",Halloween
625,Wade_C,"""He was not her brother, that's something John Carpenter and Debra Hill made up. This totally isn't expostition!""",6,30 March 2020,"This film is simple. It is a simple film that didn't work as much as I wanted it to. I remember thinking after I left the theater ""BEST HORROR MOVIE EVER! OMG!"" After re-watching it by buying it on Vudu, My thoughts changed a lot. This isn't a bad sequel, Far from it, but it suffers from what I like to call ""Modern Horror Problems!"" Problem 1. Too many dumb Jumpscares: Let me explain, Jumpscares aren't bad (although they're not scary), The only problem is that some feel unneeded. It is just part of the checklist I guess. 2. Half the acting is always really bad in Modern Horror Movies for some reason: Two words, Judy Greer. Tell me, Did they drug her and bring her to the set? She felt as if she was asleep or just here for the few pennies she was probably paid. The guy who played the Dr. Loomis replacement was disappointing and just made me wish he wasn't even in the film. Then we have the podcasters and comic relief cops, who sucked and that's all I need to say about them. 3. Dumb character decisions aplenty!
Overall, A solid 8/10, I kinda question why I think it is good enough for an 8/10, because now that I think about it, Maybe a 6 or 7 would be a more fitting rating, but screw it, A 8/10 will due!",Halloween

Oh did I not mention Jamie lee Curtis cause she killed it. The gore is amazing, and I would give it ten stars. But unfortunately there is a really really bad plot twist.

I find the acting to be quite bad and the lines by Laurie like ""Happy Halloween Michael"" just come across as cringey to me. Michael Myers mask is very original looking but the weathering looks a bit unrealistic. Laurie seems to carry the same PTSD as in H20 in the other timeline. This entry just did not really need to happen.",Halloween
629,Kaat1220,Close Enough to Perfect!,9,17 December 2018,"I loved this, and let's get real. The acting in this is far superior than in the original movie. Laurie Strode's two friends in the original could not act; they were horrible.But I do have one quibble about Michael.Michael Myers takes slow, measured steps. He is never too slow, nor is he too quick, and he NEVER turns his head; he turns his entire body.In this version, he sometimes moves too quickly, and turns his head which is a bit off-putting to me. He also made a slight sound when Laurie stabbed him through the door.Except for those two issues, I absolutely loved this version.I really missed Loomis though. He cannot be replaced.",Halloween

631,aaalllrrraaammm,"Overrated, naive, terribly written, and nonsensical",2,26 August 2019,"This movie tries so hard to be the 80's slasher that it completely loses itself in the tropes and cliches of that time and basically ignores that it's set in 2018. In this movie's version of 2018 people barely even use cellphones, they make stupid decisions leading to certain death, and there is no sense of national manhunt and breaking news. One side of the street could literally be completely oblivious to the breaking news on the other side with police lights and everything. Dialogue gets so shamefully bad that I don't even want go go there. Some key characters are so poorly defined and developed that some of their acts will make you laugh. Michael can be knocked unconscious by punches, deterred by bites, but shotguns only seem to nudge him a bit and cause him to lose half a step. This movie had absolutely no reason to exist and as far as I am concerned it is an ugly end to the franchise. I simply don't care anymore.BTW, How did this get the metascore of 67? There is literally nothing here that warrants anything over 30, and I think I am being generous here.",Halloween

634,tylerwoodrownichols,Please... No Sequels!,5,19 October 2018,"OK, I'll admit I went into this with high expectations, which was probably a mistake. I'm not by any means a huge fan of the original 1978 film, but I do find it entertaining. I've always thought it was the ONLY good film in the franchise though, and (naively) that's part of what intrigued me about this one. That and the rave reviews, which at this point I just don't understand. Oh, and the trailer, which I regretted watching because it spoiled the only good parts of the movie. If you have any intention of going to see this, I'd strongly advise you to avoid viewing the trailer. But honestly, I don't think I would have liked it any better if I'd taken that advice myself.This movie has a lot of problems that I just cannot forgive. The biggest one is that it's just not ""scary"", or even ""creepy"". It felt like they couldn't decide what they wanted to do with the plot, so they threw together elements from what could have been several different movies. The only problem is, this movie is only 2 hours long so there are a lot of ideas they can't follow through on, leaving us with what feels like a jumbled mess, plot-wise and tonally. There are lots of comedic elements that just felt out of place. Julie has been transformed from slasher movie trope into action movie trope, and the movie itself undergoes a very similar transformation. All of the killings feel like things I've seen a million times before. Then there's a ""twist"" at the end of the second act that made me think for a brief moment that things were going to head in an unexpected direction. Well, that ends up going nowhere and things go right back on the rails for a groan-inducingly predictable final act. And wouldn't you know it sets itself up for another sequel at the end. Please no. Just stop.",Halloween

This movie did it the right way, a horror movie that makes sense, has good action and most importantly for a reboot, gives you awesome nostalgia in many scenes. Every single actor in this movie did an outstanding job and I was astounded by how well they did Micheal Myers. For anybody who has seen the previous halloween movies, the last scene does you justice and is very exciting. Every single murder scene in this movie is just like the older movies. Only got scared 2 times at the start but adjusted to it after that. I don't think newcomers to the Halloween series will enjoy it close to anywhere as much as others, but it's still a must watch for me.",Halloween

638,jonrose-55803,A CRUSHING DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,1,22 October 2018,"As a MASSIVE fan of Halloween, I waited impatiently since January when filming commenced in Charleston, SC.Through the next several months I found myself constantly checking in to see how filming was going, pics from the set, updates etc.The trailer was finally released, and the movie looks stellar. I mean it looks completely devastating! I'm thinking....they finally made it right! Bring it on!The release date finally arrives. Me and some friends, all big fans, arrive at the theater get our snacks and eagerly wait for the previews to end so we can fully engage ourselves in the latest installment of Halloween.Opening scene at Smith's Grove Sanitarium was decent, despite a weird location within the institution that looked like something out of Alice in Wonderland. Awkward one sided verbal exchange between two podcasters and the shape himself who is now 61 years old. It shows. The old faded William Shatner mask is produced, no reaction from MM but the other weirdos in never never land come to life. Then the opening credits roll which we witness an inflatable pumpkin ???? Which comes as silly and extremely cartoonish! After this the movie completely derails....My biggest nightmare came true. They DID NOT get it right!The whole movie is a complete rehash of scenes from the previous installments and you've seen the movie if you viewed the trailer. I'm not joking! Although they switch roles. Examples: LS is visible through classroom window now, not MM ??? LS disappears when thrown out a window now, not MM ???The movie contains comedy, yes comedy ???The little black kid is funny, but it is completely cringeworthy when he is cracking jokes during the closet kill scene which is supposed to be terrifying. But it's really not because we all saw this scene in the trailer ..yawn... Huge mistake to place any comedy in this movie!!Speaking of young kids, MM kills them now ???? Its just not cool or entertaining!Awful score. The score is completely different in the trailer than it is in the movie itself ??? Nothing like JC's original score. Even had scenes in the trailer that were not in the movie itself. I can only assume that there were reshoots done because of a poor test screening or something ???The editing was pathetic. MM is here, then there, then here in a closet, then over there. Jesus, there was no flow at all. When something developed the scene ended ??? Most of the kills which were really over the top occurred off screen ??? It cut back to the scene eventually and it's like oh ok...a teenager is knifed into a wall with halloween decorations on him ???Next, Michael Myers himself. MM walks extremely fast now ??? He walks away from Will Patton in a house so fast that he avoids bullets and being apprehended ??? MM is like Jason Bourne now walking briskly through Europe. It's just stupid. There were some scenes that it actually looked like he was being controlled by an XBOX controller...very robotic. MM also kills people Jason Voohees style now. Over the top gore and decorates the bodies. One deputy's skull was decorated with lights and placed on the barrel of a shotgun ??????Pointless characters. There were so many: The two podcasters were only there to be killed off so MM could get his mask. The black sheriff with the stupid cowboy hat was completely pointless, Kerri's husband was awful casting and a token death victim, but he did made some penis jokes ??? All the teenagers were pointless because there was absolutely no character development. Cops were useless as always in these movies ..yawnLaurie Strode, was basically Kerri Tate from H20 just older and had more balls. I read in a previous review that she was Kevin McAllister from Home Alone....Spot on!There was no suspense at all in this movie. They made a crucial mistake by showing the film through MM's point of view, instead of everyone else. It wasn't scary at all because we all knew exactly where he was too. It didn't help that the trailer revealed way way too much!Lastly, the doctor. The poor man's evil Loomis. This plot twist was the final nail in the coffin for this dud! The guy kills Will Patton and puts on the MM mask and drags MM to the back of the police cruiser because he wants MM to meet with LS at the McAllister cabin.... Just no! Hell no! What were they thinking ??? This idea was used in Halloween 5 and 6 which ruined those installments. Why that angle again ??? ...Come on man!!Ending was also boring and unsatisfactory! There will be more of these cash grabs. Not for this guy!Anyway, any real fan will loathe this movie like me and my friends. The trailer got me because it was very deceiving! It wont happen anymore because I'm finished with these movies!...We should have went to the original Halloween that was playing in the next theatre!7.6 rating is simply inncorrect!Devastated!",Halloween

I am really looking forward to the next two sequels. Its amazing how this film, ""Halloween 11"" is the highest grossing slasher film of all time and broke all these records.

There was even one scene that had a nice large sequence all done in ""one shot"" where Michael Myers did one killing and the camera followed him to the second house to do a second killing. However, it just started to get stupid. There were way too many times I was like ""okay, what happened to that person"" or ""don't they have news in Haddonfield"" or that's way too big a coincidence"" or ""okay, this is getting too drawn out"".

644,obeys,David Gordon Greens body of work is confusing,5,13 October 2018,"Sitges Film Festival ReviewAs the title says, I am pretty confused with the directors overall body of work. He started out with indie stuff that even got the Criterion Collection treatment. And then there are things like Annanas Express and Your Highness as well. And now a Halloween remake/sequel.
Maybe my brain is just not wired in a way where this body of work makes sense to me. (It would be less confusing if there would not be this little indie gems in-between)
And I also can't make out a directors habndwriting in all of these different directions. What is a DGG movie? His comedy movies could have made by just anyone. 
Then again, maybe I should read more into Green as well first. With this said let's talk Halloween. 
Again, I can't see a clear directors take on it. Especially compared with the Rob Zombie ones. But maybe that's a good thing that everybody wanted?
I was surprised by the lack of the directors own voice. But I was also surprised that the movie did not bother me as a remake/reboot/sequel/whatever. It kinda really captures what the first movie was about.

647,doneil4,Just what the Halloween franchise needed,8,23 September 2019,"Halloween 2018 brings us a new prospective of the franchise, disregarding all of the sequels from Halloween II to Resurrection. Was this right direction to take franchise in? Absolutely! At first when I learned this was the direction they were taking, I was... not skeptical, but more concerned at the idea of erasing all of the previous sequels. But thankfully, I had no reason to worry. It's a great alternative take on the story.For anyone who hasn't seen this film, I will advise to keep in mind that only the events of the original Halloween (1978) have taken place prior to the events in Haloween 2018. I'm not giving away spoilers here, just providing information you will need to know to understand what this movie is all about. Although it becomes pretty obvious when watching the film, but I'd rather you have an idea of the basic story.Now of course, there's going to be fans of the Halloween franchise that are more loyal to the original sequels (well... some of them) and that's understandable. We've grown up with them. So the idea of another sequel that dismisses all of the previous sequels can be a hard pill to swallow. But if you love your horror, I'd always recommend Halloween 2018.The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, but should that come as a shock? No, it's John Carpenter for crying out loud. But he sure provides something unexpected. Jamie Lee Curtis is back! And Michael Myers is brutally awesome!",Halloween

So does Michael (how does he get into the closet, and why bother?). There's no cat-and-mouse stalking like the original... is Michael even looking for Laurie, or was that just a coincidence? Michael seems to be all over the place, with no purpose or direction, apart from killing anyone (even a kid). I loved the music and it was never boring, but I'm starting to think this was all style over substance. I need to see it again.. (I'll wait for the bluray).",Halloween
651,jimw-63592,A Big Thumbs Down!,4,24 October 2018,"What a let down of a movie! I loved Halloween 1, 2 & even Season of the Witch. I personally think Halloween 2 is better than Halloween 2018. This movie was just a brutal slasher film with a bad plot. I think around 15-17 people bite the dust in this film, in very gory ways.
What made Halloween 1 & 2 great is how dark the lighting was, with shadows everywhere and Myers looming out of sight waiting to attack his victoms. In Halloween 2018 the camera just follows him from house to house as he brutally kills people. What really irked me is when he killed one woman who had a baby in it's crib in the next room, which I found very tacky and offensive. and un-called for by the people who made this film. This film was very well lite......no dark, shadowy errie scenes like the original. It was like we almost always knew where Myers was at all times.
I was also looking forward to the credits, which I found to be a let down as well. Taking the original pumpkin form Halloween 1978, it starts out completely rotted, but grows back to it's original form as the credits roll.
Judy Greer's character and her husbands were annoying as were most of the characters in this movie. They never really grew on me. I liked the granddaughter and Jami Lee did a decent job, but laughed because they tried to make her character like Linda Hamilton's in T-2. You would think she would have moved far away from Haddonfield and gone under a new name (kind of like H20.) Why would anyone remain in a town like that after what she went through? A constant reminder and the fact that Myers was not that far away in the mental institution.
To me, this movie does not exist in the ""real"" Halloween timeline. For me, Myers died when Dr. Loomis set him on fire and he died inside the hospital. End of movie and story line!",Halloween

I'm not going to phrase it as a true sequel as Halloween 2 was brilliant. This movie, is everything that 4, 5, Curse, H20, resurrection, and Zombies remakes should have been. Nostalgia captured for the modern era. Excellently written, great acting and fantastic story, welcoming back Nick Castle who portrays Michael perfectly all these years later. Mr Carpenter's music score is a huge additive to capturing those wow moments that create the intensity. A fantastic movie where everyone will be entitled to one good scare!

Is this what horror films have become? Really? To say this wasn't even scary is a gross understatement. ...it was so dull and boring I could literally take my grandmother in to see it, and she hates horrors! There was no scares, no plot, rather poor acting and an even worse script.
Why did Jamie Lee Curtis even sign up for this garbage? As for Michael Myers himself?, all I could say was he was a joke of his former self ....at least in the other Halloween movies he was a terrifying force to be reckoned with and he was genuinely scary, whereas in this movie he was a shell of his former self.

672,garyvanb,"Well Yes, This Probably IS the Best Sequel",9,19 November 2018,"My horror movie loving sister hated it. All the horror movie vloggers on YouTube, like the guy who does Cinemassacre, Sean Chandler and Cody Leach, agree it's the best thing to happen to the Halloween franchise since the original, though, like me, they agree it's still not a perfect horror movie or sequel, but it's nowhere near as bad as my sister made it out to be. Her opinion, I think, may have been influenced by Jamie Lee Curtis' far leftist politics. Regardless, she probably didn't like how the character of Laurie Strode has been living like a reclusive kook for 40 years, and I myself kind of scratched my head at that, but I'm sure in today's untra left wing feminist climate, it's all about WOMAN fighting back from victimhood. In that respect, I can understand her aversion. But as just a slasher film, it IS scary, and has a few good twists, and was wise to pick up the story 40 years later as if none of those other increasingly silly Halloween sequels, reboots and remakes had ever happened. It was also a bit more literate, made by intelligent people with more going on under the surface, with themes and intentional social commentary. And a lot of their story choices - scenes, camera angles, etc. - intentionally harkened back to the original. So although my sister says ""skip this one,"" I say it's definitely the best thing to happen to the Halloween franchise since Jamie Lee Curtis returned the first time, 20 years ago, and along with that film (Halloween H2O) and the original, is definitely in the top 3, probably even the top 2. And just in case anyone is wondering, rounding out the top 5 would be Halloween 2 (the first one, not that awful Rob Zombie one, and the only other one to star Curtis) and Halloween 4, which was pretty good all the way through and had an amazing ending from a storytelling point of view. But this one is right up there with the best of this franchise!",Halloween

Rinse and repeat, ad nauseam.",Halloween
675,jasonklingensmith,A huge disappointment.,3,11 December 2018,"Like most, I was genuinely excited to see a new edition to the Halloween franchise. When the first trailer was released, I wasn't sold. It kind of looked a bit ridiculous. But when the second trailer released, I started to buy into the hype. It seemed like this might be the best Halloween movie in a long time. Unfortunately, that was not the case.
I think a lot of this movie's success was similar to what happened with H20 in 1998 and the Rob Zombie remake in 2007. Fans of the franchise were eager for something new, something fresh. They had already declared it success before seeing it. No matter what, this movie was going to succeed in theaters. What's puzzling is the amount of positive reviews it's gotten. I think a few years of now, when those same people watch it again they'll realize this simply isn't a very good movie.The cold open was unrealistic, unnecessary, and quite frankly ridiculous. IMO, it was a failed attempt to build tension and suspense around the mask. Speaking of the mask, it was literally the only purpose the British journalists served in terms of the story (reuniting Myers with the mask). I don't have much of a problem with that, though, considering they were kind of annoying. The opening scene was essentially a journalist yelling at a mental patient to look at his mask, in a rather ridiculous setting. Are there really mental institutions that anchor their patients to anvils on weird checkerboards for ""outdoor time""? Also, considering, he waited 40 years to escape, does this mean the mask is ultimately the source of his power? It almost feels that way.
It takes a while for the actual story to get off the ground. And while that's happening, there's clunky dialogue and ultimately failed attempts at humor with essentially meaningless characters. Meanwhile they highlight Laurie struggles with PTSD that has led to a strained relationship with her daughter and family.
Once things do get going, there are a few cool scenes. That is probably the highlight of the film, and sandwiched in between those cool scenes are frame by frame recreations of scenes already done in the pre-existing films.Then we get to the ""twist"", which I must admit, was well done and I didn't see it coming. However, the more you think about it, the less sense it makes. If his Doctor (aka the new Loomis) wanted to know what it was like, wanted to hear Michael talk, it's hard to imagine he didn't have chances to do this previously. However, his motivation makes it clear he was an inside man on the bus crash that led to Michael breaking free.The finale and final showdown, while tense at moments, was a huge letdown. First of all, Laurie states that she's been praying for Michael to break out for 40 years, so that she can kill him (so much so she has a little training montage of target practice shooting, shows off her impressive collection of guns and weapons and her handy little panic room). So, what does she do when he's standing in her front yard uncovered, and she has a shotgun in her hands? She locks the front door and cowers behind it. This would make sense if Myers was the inhuman evil monster he's been made out to be throughout the years, however, they make a point of stressing that Myers is ""human"", just a deranged man, which Laurie herself even says. Despite that, he takes a gunshot to the neck, the head, and the hand, none of which slow him down. And interestingly enough, the shot to the hand seems to have the biggest effect on him, and by far the most blood.In the finale, when they trap him in the basement, they just stand there, as the house is starting to burn. Considering the floors above her little trap are just basic wood, one would think those were flammable and they'd be booking it out of there. Instead, they stand there watching Michael getting ready to burn. They do get out, but with seemingly little urgency, and then we see them riding in the backup of a pickup truck that they've flagged down, leaving things unresolved. Did Michael burn to death? Apparently not, as there's already a sequel in the works.Overall, a big let down. Only thing that made it watchable was a handful of cool scenes.",Halloween
676,geno-young,An interesting concept film.....,10,23 October 2018,"*NO SPOILERS*
I just saw the new Halloween film today and at first I wasn't sure if I'd like it since it totally retcons all other installments in the series (I have a huge problem with movies that do that) but I actually really liked it. And it really takes a lot to please me, especially going into a film with the mixed feelings that I had, and especially dealing with a series that is such a big part of my life. But I was pleasantly impressed. It doesn't annul the other films for me though, especially the ""Thorn Trilogy"" (Halloween 4-6) since those are the films that actually turned me on to Michael Myers when I was 6 years old, but it does offer a different perspective and holds up very well as a ""What If?"" concept film. ""What if Michael never escaped and never resumed his massacre that faithful night?"" ""What if Laurie Strode wasn't his sister, and he hunted her down for reasons only known to him?"" ""What if he WAS captured and locked away for 40 years and this poor, innocent woman had to live with this for all of this time wondering why she was the target of his murderous obsession losing her children, marriages and sanity? Existing, not living. Waiting and PREPARING for him to escape for 40 years."" These are the thoughts that this film evokes and that's why it works. Although it can never replace Halloween's 2-8, it offers a breath of fresh air to the series and a new perspective. I accept this film as a concept film, an alternate storyline or even a piece of concept art that is a homage to the history of these films; and hopefully a concept series diving deeper into this grisly take on John Carpenter's classic ""Halloween."" 🎃🔪Well done Blumhouse, Bravo! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾P.S. If you are a Halloween fanatic like me you will notice multiple Easter Eggs ALL throughout this film that pays homage to the sequels in a really cool way. I was able to pick them all out instantly. I counted about 5 of them, see if you can find more!😉*I still would like to see him go after his nephew, John from ""H20"" and (by now) wife and kids in the original story line, but I guess that's another story. I honestly would have preferred that. When you think of it, there's so much story left in the series! The possibilities!*",Halloween
677,recklesscow,Tonally inconsistent and spreads itself too thin.,6,19 October 2018,"For starters, I'm a huge ""Halloween"" buff, so I was anticipating this ""recalibration"" since it was announced.Jamie Lee back in action, Carpenter on board as a producer and scorer--what could go wrong?Unfortunately, a few things.One, this new ""Halloween"" seems to be having an identity crisis. It's a somber psychoanalysis on the effects of severe trauma. It's a teenage relationship film. It's a babysitter-in-peril slasher film. It's an action-packed revenge movie. It's too many things, none of them consistent. One moment we're watching hand-held, soft-focus camerawork focusing on a crying Jamie Lee as she copes with her past trauma--a beautiful, poignant shot with diffused lighting that's very ""indie."" The next, we're transported back into a 1980s slasher film before taking a veer into an episode of ""Dawson's Creek"" with two teenagers at the school dance. Scenes and tones transition without much coherency, almost as if the director was trying to force several film genres into one movie to cover all possible audience bases. You want a thumping action flick with shootouts and fights? We gotcha covered. A classic slasher film complete with 80s synth score? We got ya there, too. For the kids, you want something to relate to, some high school problems? Come on in. Had the film chosen to stick to one or even two of these genres, I feel the tone would have benefitted from it massively.Yes, Michael is back and deadly, the kills being more akin to Rob Zombie's entries in terms of explicit violence. When Michael is on-screen, the film works wonderfully. Unfortunately, this being a ""Halloween"" film and a slasher, he's in it far too seldom for my taste. In the original ""Halloween"", Michael is a presence in the film from the opening right towards the very end, barely going 5 minutes without an appearance of some sort--lurking around bushes, watching from street curbs, etc. In this ""Halloween"", there's an entire 20-minute segment with no Michael at all. What's more, entire narrative segments have either been left unscripted or edited out for running time, leaving some jarring transitions where some offscreen action is explained via dialogue. One of these is the critical bus crash that allows Michael to escape--the scene is never witnessed in the film, only the aftermath. The same can be said for the fate of one character, whose death we only see in hindsight.There are also two completely out-of-left-field subplots that spring up and go absolutely nowhere. How they weren't written out is beyond me, as they promise much exposition in the coming scenes only to completely be abandoned or forgotten about in the next. One has to wonder if such ""twists"" were really necessary to get said character from point A to point B--certainly there are less outlandish ways, no?But all's not lost. The film does provide several hair-raising moments of suspense, and, when it plays to its slasher root strengths, works. One can't help but lament how much better it would have been had these elements been the sole priorities throughout.Jamie Lee is fantastic again as Laurie Strode, and the new cast members all hold their own. The cinematography, albeit ranging from tonally inconsistent indie shots to glossy big-production horror film, is all very good, as is the music.There's fun to be had here, no doubt, but the overall product is a strange mishmash of ideas and genres, like putting multiple kids' breakfast cereals into one bowl.The original ""Halloween"" sequel still reigns supreme.",Halloween

I really enjoyed it and would describe it as more of a thriller than a horror.From what I've read Michael Myers became a bit like Jason Voorhees in the Halloween sequels in that he took on a sort of unearthly 'can't die' attribute. It becomes a bit silly to see these super strong, and constantly regenerating characters, constantly brought back time and again to chase around sex starved teenagers.This Halloween has a strong footing in realism, some of the death scenes are quite vicious, and I rather enjoyed it. I think it's getting a lot of had from the original fans who don't want to see a fresh take on this franchise.

691,kardayathomas,Halloween,6,19 October 2018,"A bit more than just a run of the mill slasher. In a world where I am sick of remakes, reboots, reimagines, sequels and prequels. This film starts off with promise but weakens and looses potential to become something great when it cheapens out to fall apart and become idiotic in the last third as the veteran psychiatrist turns out to be a nut who wants to murder someone.
That one scene and him wearing the Myer's mask was so stupid, like it belonged from a lesser film. It was enough to pull me out of the experience.",Halloween
692,mitchw-61-305942,Messy Myers Movie. Oh My Laurie!,3,15 April 2020,"I'm re-watching this for a 3rd time.What wasted talent. Jamie Lee is a strong actress. She should have written the movie.The plot and dialogue is terrible.
Whoever the casting director was made terrible choices for the Dad in the film. Unlikable, unsympatheic, unfunny hick. I like Judy Greer but her character could have been written with some assistance from psychologist who know more about parent-child dynamics with her and Laurie's history.
Grandaughter was a nothing role. Neither likeable or unlikeable.
Idiot character choices. Unrealistic character decisions. Their stories could have been fleshed out so audiences could empathise with their deaths. The blonde chick was okay, but it's as though the writers over-stereotyped teens today, and how childish or pathetic they are.
They were like cartoons!
No decent chase scenes.
One scene kills for no reason.
Michael's psychiatrist's storyline was cheap. Maybe could have worked with some insight into psychopathic doctor's.
As if any criminally insane facility would allow journalists to interview Michael, with his mask, in a courtyard in front of other criminally insane inmates!! I liked the reporters deaths, though. I thimk theirs was the only death scene I enjoyed.
And the father and son who see the bus breakdown with people in white suits walking around ... call for help, you wouldn't go take a look at night on an empty dark road. Pfft.
Maybe 911 will send a whole ONE officer, again, for every call out. Get some cops to tell you how it's done writers.
Shame. Disappointed.The pros ... there was good use of effects, Jamie can act, I like Judy Greer though her character was disappointing. I can't even recall her character, or the granddaughter caring that the husdband/Dad was killed. All good work by supporting departments wasted on crap script / storyline and directing.Oh my Laurie.",Halloween

Of course the transport of Mr. Myers was planned on Halloween night-of all nights and times of a day, of course the bus broke, of course a well trained person on guns won't use them while aurrounded by all types of guns, and of course even if u know much better, instead of shooting ur life enemy in the head, u burn ur whole house down!

695,Blogger66,Movie For Only People Who Lived In 80s and Some Teenagers,5,21 October 2018,"I am one of many people who are guilty of being loyal to 80s slasher movies, even when the majority of them aren't that entertained nowadays. I don't have an answer to myself the purpose of continuing my loyalty to these 80s horror franchises.Again, I don't get it why I couldn't wait any longer to watch Halloween on the day it released. Thank my AMC stub pass, it gave me an excuse to attend a high-quality Dolby cinema.At first, I wasn't familiar with how it fits into the Halloween franchise. I checked on IMDB, and it said ""recalibration."" That statement wasn't helpful to my understanding at all until the credits were shown in the opening scene. I realized it's John Carpenter (creation of Halloween franchise) who attempted to connect that movie to the first Halloween film in 1978. It suddenly subtracted half of my viewing excitement because the Halloween reboot in 2007 was my favorite one out of eleven installments.For the reason that the Halloween reboot in 2007 was my favorite is that I like how it turned out to be a psychological horror instead of a typical slasher film. It made Michael Myers seem to be an insane serial killer, not an unreal superhero slasher. Not only about killing, but also it involved mentally and emotionally along with the application of the psychology field. Little by little, it gave glance inside Myers' mind.However, the second installment of Halloween reboot in 2009 took a huge step back. It was a surprise to see positive reviews on the newest installment. It led me to assume that it would be much similar to Halloween 2007 but with a more in-depth glimpse of Michael Myers.Unfortunately, I was wrong. You people clicked +7 stars just because it's a cool mindless slasher film. I get it that you appreciate the taste of your old fondness memory of your time in the late 70s/early 80s. Come on, we're living in a progressive era, and we should be supportive of deeper and meaningful films. I'm miserable by the fact that you encourage to simplify the movies into shallow and mindless films.On the other hand, I respect John Carpenter for his doing to sweep nine installments within 40 years under the rug and created the ""second"" installment into his historical franchise. That was to intend to continue their new sequence in the future. He was smart to avoid explaining what position of this film has to do in a long going franchise. Instead, he carried on the similarities from the original to this new installment in intention to motive the audience to forget all the reboots and sequels after Halloween (1978). It concluded with high revenue and opened the pave to start a new sequence. Quite an impressive work by John!I gave Halloween (2018) a five star just because of my loyalty to 80s slasher films, better plot than most slasher films, and I cannot lie that it was fun to watch for once.One last thing, I cannot be defeated in this argument because Jamie Curtis was unhappy about where the franchise heads to either.Spoiler: Michael Myers didn't die.",Halloween
696,cre8toruk,Another halloween step too far,1,3 July 2020,"The original Halloween movie (1978? I assume as it keeps being mentioned in this incarnation) was excellent I remember watching as a young(ish) teen, really ""enjoying"" the jumps and the thrills not to mention the imaginative kills that Michael Myers performs. From then on it's gone decidedly down hill... Halloween II was ""ok"" but nothing to write home about and if the movie producers hadn't got the message by this point that this was a movie that really really didn't need a franchise and to produce what we might laughingly call sequels would be a mistake then I guess the $ signs clearly got in the way. We had Halloween 3D a complete turkey and then a gap until Halloween H20 which again didn't really rise the the heights of the original.... So the powers that be have decided that it's been a long enough gap for us to forget the garbage that has gone before and Jamie Lee Curtis clearly needed the money because the best I can say about this movie is that I'm hopeful movie makers around the world will realise that they really really can stop making these movies now. The story line is formulaic and has nothing new to tell. The story is basically like the original, I can't really see the point of saying there are spoilers in my review since everyone who's seen any of the halloween movies (apart from 3D which was just weird), knows everything that's going to happen in this one. We never get to understand Michael's motives for his murders, why he picks on adults and leaves children untouched (I mean you're either a murdering psychopath or you aren't frankly) and given the opportunity which is all over the film and the trailer for Jamie Lee to finally impart her revenge and kill Michael once and for all, instead we're sort of left thinking that there might be an opening for another reboot... All I can ask, nay plead is that they just don't. This is utter crap there are better more scary disney movies than this badly written, badly acted, poorly scripted garbage. I had to watch parts of the movie twice since I'd fallen asleep during it (that's how bad it is!). What I don't get and this isn't limited to this excuse for a movie, is why Hollywood insist on making and remaking more and more poor sequels for movies. I know there's money in it, but where are the people with standards, movie making is supposed to be an art, but I don't see any artists here. Why didn't an established actor like Jamie Lee Curtis simply walk away from this project, I mean I'm no expert but if I can see how bad this script is then I'm amazed she didn't.
I would simply suggest, if you're interested in the Halloween concept to go an watch the original movie. It is a work of art, well written and conceived and has an originality about it that none of it's sequels have ever been able to do better.",Halloween

I constantly felt like they were taking things safe while watching this, the slight comedy and light heartedness also helped to soften the mood, mainstream audiences may enjoy this aspect but maybe not horror fans who enjoy a more serious and gritty feel.I give it a 6.5, it's satisfying to watch and not bad at all.",Halloween
700,savagerox-39160,Halloween of a good time,7,17 October 2021,The recent 2021 release has encouraged me to defend some of the sequels and this 2018 release doesn't need me to defend it. What it is has in common with some of the better sequels is it has a good storyline and feel to it. My one problem is Michael Myers kills a 11 or 12 year old kid. Completely unnecessary because the kid posed no threat. With that said it was a well made movie until now I wouldn't classify it as a sequel but with this new release I would say it is.The problem with this movie is like 2 or 3 other entries you were convinced it was the end and by the end of the movie you felt that it was. On its own merits with the exception of some of the excessive violence this is one of the better movies in the franchise and should have been left as such.Hollywood is clearly out of new ideas and judging by the countless reboots and superhero movies it's a sad day that Halloween Kills is getting so much praise for being such a sub par movie. To finish Halloween 2018 is a solid movie.,Halloween
701,AustinSober,Halloween's Greatest Hits...and Not Much Else,6,21 November 2018,"Halloween 2018 was...exactly what you would expect out of slasher movie sequel...more so in a series with too many to count. Overall...it's just okay. It's a one time deal for me. There was a lot of nice stuff in here. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a great performance, Michael is portrayed perfectly... probably the best since the original Halloween II, the rest of the cast does a fairly good job, the soundtrack done by John Carpenter himself was FANTASTIC (true Carpenter music at its best), there are some cool camera directions with some good long shots that give you the feel of the first two movies, the gore effects were top notch, and aspects of the Michael vs Laurie finale were pretty cool. All this makes for an entertaining time. BUT...all of this is equaled by many issues that keep this from being anything other than okay. First, every death in the film is completely predictable . Same old formula: character gets left alone, does something stupid, jump scare, and their dead. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. This formula needs to stop already. By the third act, I was literally rolling my eyes at every character being a complete idiot for the sake of having somebody die. But hey, if you enjoy that sorta predictability...Halloween 2018 has you covered for sure. Just don't plan on remembering the teen cast. Heck one character just disappeared from the movie completely. Speaking of stupid decisions, around the start of the third act...a character does something beyond idiotic. It is probably the stupidest thing I have seen this year...and I saw ""The Predator"" this year for crying out loud. And to make matters worse...it correlates with the elements that set the whole film's plot in motion. So the whole plot happens because of the lowest of low in stupidity. Then there is that fact that the film just can't stop knocking on the other films' doors. Too many forced references to the superior classic and heck even the whole Michael vs Laurie thing was ripped from Halloween H20! Only this time rather than her progression feeling logical, she is now basically Sarah Conner from ""Terminator"" mixed with Kevin McCallister from ""Home Alone"". It's a bit over the top but hey Curtis makes the most of it. Finally, the modern trend of forced comedy continues. Just because Marvel does it, doesn't mean everyone has too! Outside one little kid with a foul language problem...the humor just didn't work and distracted from the horror. Thus this movie is not remotely scary beyond those ""good"" old jump scares. (Sarcasm) Still, I was fairly entertained believe it or not and this is certainly better than 4-6 and Resurrection. But to me, Halloween II (1982) is still the proper sequel and I would probably put H20 above it too. This to me is just mildly entertaining fan fiction.",Halloween

I feel like the ingredients were there for a masterpiece, and instead we got ""pretty good"". Where the original created a diamond from dust, all I can say about this one is that it's not a bust.If this is part one of a two-part sequel to the original and if part two is the main course, then this movie suddenly makes WAY more sense and is magically transformed for the better. I think a sequel is assured, but it remains to be seen if we'll get satisfaction or if nothing is learned from the franchise's past and an extended money grab ends in another laughable heap of sequels.

707,mullen1979,Back to the roots,10,17 July 2019,"On Halloween night in 1978, Laurie Strode survived a vicious attack at the hands of escaped mental patient Michael Myers.
It is now the year 2018. It has been 40 years since that night, to the day.
Michael Myers has been incarcerated for his crimes and has been locked up in Smith's grove sanitarium for the past 4 decades. It's the night before Halloween and he is being transferred to another facility. Or so that's the plan.
Laurie Strode has been mentally disturbed and her relationship with her family suffers as a result of her trauma. She has been sleeping with one eye open since that fateful night in 1978 and has been living her life as a paranoid survivalist. Her daughter resents her. Only her granddaughter does she seek any comfort and understanding.
When Laurie hears of the news that Michael has escaped and his path to haddonfield has left a trail of new victims, she immediately seeks out her family to take refuge in the basement of her home. But she is unable to reach her granddaughter, who has now caught the eyes of her age old nemesis.
This movie works as a great follow up to the 1978 original in terms of characterization and cinematography. But truly lacks tension and a terrifying villain.
The film relies heavily on the iconography of the image of Michael Myers and of Laurie Strode herself. And as a huge fan of the franchise, that alone is a huge delight.
There's a few moments in this film where it lacked authenticity and there are others where the opportunity to really ""take it there"" were missed.
Overall, the film is a major treat to someone like myself.",Halloween

Obviously if you watched the sequels the count would be closer to 25 than 5. Was this movie good? Not particularly. The usual mayhem, the masked Meyer killing with abandon and no motive.

712,wkallao,On Par With The Original,10,15 October 2018,"After seeing this film, I realized how all the prior sequels missed the mark on everything. Those sequels missed dedication, passion and promise - three things that this film all included. Halloween (2018) isn't just a well made horror movie, it's a well made movie in every aspect. The cinematography is gorgeous, the lighting is eerie, the acting is phenomenal, the music is chilling...and it is scary!!!In this film we follow Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) who has been suffering from PTSD for 40 years following her escape from Michael Myers back in 1978. This film does an impeccable job of portraying PTSD, and how Laurie's life has been derailed by it. The film follows Michael escaping after a bus crash, and in this film - Laurie is the one hunting him down. It is a unique twist that is well done.This film is filled to the brim with incredible references to all prior films and is done so cleverly, they work! These allusions don't feel forced or like a gimmick. They are natural and work so well with the film. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat because for the first time in 40 years, we feel how scary and dangerous Michael is. From when we first see him in action., we know he isn't not here to mess around.Aside from some necessary expositional dialogue, this film makes all its marks. It is a film done so well with such passion and dedication. David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and Jeff Fradley made an impossible to miss movie. Finally, a Halloween sequel that feels like a MOVIE. A true story you are invested in and can follow.This is a MUST SEE film for all Halloween fans - and all horror fanatics, and anyone who just loves good movies! I viewed this film in a special screening, and the audience there screamed, laughed and cheered their way through it the entire thing. This will go down as one of the best horror films made, and even one of the best slashers too. This film is so well done, it doesn't only outdo all the sequels, it nearly outdoes the original.

She saves the film. The rest of the characters are useless and theres no type of development to make us actually care about them, and that includes Laurie's granddaughter. She has a lot more scenes than Jamie Lee Curtis , yet none are memorable. Heck, I even cared more about the babysitter and the young man more than I did about her .The mother is naive and annoying ""the world is full of loving and understanding people""really lady ? Lol. What world do you live on ? Anyways the first 70% of the movie is just about Michael going on his usual killing spree. I expected to see more gore in the kills , I feel like we just saw the aftermath for most of the kills. It could've been a redeeming quality to distract us from the dragging plot. No seriously this movie drags! Theres even a random scene with cops eating lunch that seem like time filler. Strange .As I mentioned before JLC is the best thing about this movie. Her acting was great. Her character is great. If you've watched the original Halloween you can totally see the effects of the trauma. Shes turned from scared innocent girl to a paranoid bad ass.

But what they actually released I found to have all the flavor and appeal of a moldy, 40-year-old leftover sandwich. Story for this film wasn't terrible but the final execution could have at least been decentIt was incredibly bland and didn't even feel like a Halloween movie (Halloween as in the holiday), and to me it had all the entertainment value of watching paint dry. I found at least three quarters of it about as boring and worthless as a horror blockbuster can be; I wanted to walk out really badly. I would honestly take Resurrection over this film because at least that movie knows it's bad and you can laugh at how bad it is.None of the characters were likable aside from Laurie and you could see everyone's demise coming from a mile away. I would be more forgiving of it had this film been enjoyable, but as I have said before, I found it the perfect opposite of entertainment. The only parts I really liked were the opening scene and maybe the third act. Some of the parallels to this film and the original I found clever, but none of those few positives were enough to save this steaming pile for me.This film is still better than the Rob Zombie disasters although only by a little and that really doesn't say much. If I were forced to choose the five absolute worst films of the Halloween series, then this movie would definitely make that list. I would probably go with H5, H6, Resurrection, H18, RZH1, and RZH2 as the absolute worst.Do yourself a favor and don't see it. It's a complete waste of your time and money. It's not a Halloween movie, it's not a horror movie, it's not entertaining, it's not enjoyable, and it has no flavor IMO.

Maybe that's fitting, as this film ignores all of the sequels to that one as well as the Rob Zombie remakes. This film picks up 30 years after the original, with Michael Myers in a mental hospital and a PTSD-stricken Laurie Strode living in a fenced compound because she is convinced that Michael Myers will escape and kill again. Sadly, she is right.I've seen this film twice, and what really struck me was Laurie Strode's emotional journey. I won't spoil anything except to say that this film puts her through the wringer while still questioning her belief that the world is an evil place. Since the last film, she grew up, had a daughter and lost custody of her due to her insistence that her daughter learn about firearms and other forms of self-defense rather than ""normal kid"" stuff. Judy Greer is quite good as that daughter, and while it is understated, this film makes a feminist statement about what happens when men don't listen to women. Though flawed, the Strode women have a commonsense approach to solving problems that results in one of the most satisfying climaxes that I have seen in a film in a good, long time.A sequel is already in the works, also with Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie. I don't think I'll see it. This film is all the resolution that I need for her character. It leaves the question of whether Michael Myers is a very strong human or a supernatural force unanswered while still upholding the strength of family. Some of the minor characters and subplots could have been handled better, but that's a nitpick. This is one of the best horror films in recent memory.",Halloween

Who in there right mind would let 2 reporters in with the mask he used to kill people with and then to how he escape I would like to know firstly who organised his transfer for that day and how he managed to get out his restraints, get though a lock cage door and make the bus crash!After he escapes he first goes to a garage where it just so happens the reports are but your not kidding me that no one saw the mechanic plus the guy behind the counter get killed!On to the middle part of the film not a great deal wrong with it but nothing was really anything good about it either! He goes around and kills a few people and a disco but not a great deal, but there is no info on if Julian the kid makes it out alive or not and this is the first time Michael gets shot in the shoulder.Onto the final part after moving her family to her house and just after Michael kills her friend they go hunting him down and they see him in a police car and then run him down and he gets knocked out so that the second time he's been hurt. So then the doc kills the cop and they go to grandma's house. After he kills a few more people which includes the father and she sees him dead in the warehouse later not once does anybody ask where he is or if hes ok but hes at the front of the house why when she is looking at him at the front door with a shotgun in her hand doesn't she just open the door and fire at him but no she doesn't she waits by the door and then he manages to smash the glass with both his hands and try kill her and this is when she shoots half his fingers off. Then after a bit of cat and mouse Michael throws her out the window and finds the basement entrance manages to rip the counter off over it and then gets shot in the face and this is the 4th time he's been seriously injured but seems to carry on just fine and even after been thrown down the stairs and knifed and slashed still seems to be ok and then ends up trapped in the basement as it's set on fire! I will be really annoyed if he somehow survived and bring out another film!So overall then this was a terrible movie that didn't really explain anything going on within the movie, unrealistic, not scary in the slightest, shouldn't of been made and just proves Hollywood was just after some money! Do Not belive the hype about this movie!",Halloween
727,collin_nuke,HOLY. HALLOWEEN. HELL!!!,10,19 October 2018,This movie exceeds expectations. I am one of Halloween's biggest fans and I love the franchise regardless of how bad the movies got... but I am completely okay with them ignoring every other film and calling this the sequel the first original Halloween deserves. It will go down as another classic. The characters have this nostalgia about them that make you feel today in them with a touch of the late 70s. There's a twist in the film that was completely unexpected. Jamie Lee Curtis is a B A D ASS! Loved this film so much.,Halloween

729,furfur-1,60 minutes almost fun,5,29 December 2018,"The first 60 minutes of the movie presented a decent slasher movie. And we got on top a slight idea of a story.
The movie switch to the mid-end of the movie and get really ridiculous. We have to be tolerant in movies and accept some situations or decisions without them the movie could not be fun at all. What if Lorie took an Helicopter and just flow away? This makes sense but is no fun. BUT it isn't meant by that to make the most stupid or ridiculous decisions possible! The movie aford much more than tolerance at this point, you need devotion. I have no ideas what happened to the script writer but the movie get really hard to watch. It feels like a teenager who have to leave a party and try to get as fast as drunk as possible...",Halloween
730,WatermelonJones,How many times?,6,4 October 2021,"How many times can Mike escape? How many times can we see an unsuspecting teen say, ""see, nothing's there"" only to get killed seconds later. Curtis playing the 60 year old Strode almost certainly would have fractured a hip at some point during this movie. Are we supposed to enjoy seeing the investigative journalists die?Its fun to watch if you like Halloween or slasher films. Its a ""paint by numbers affair"" to be sure. Seeing the good doctor don the mask after killing the cop was rather unexpected but there was the requisite running through the woods scene and a number of contrived sequences. One surely must wonder how someone dressed as Mike on halloween could walk around Haddonfield unfettered for much of the film. Granted this film ignores all sequels so it is, perhaps, plausible but the audience cant help but laugh that someone as conspicuous as Mike wouldnt be picked up by the authorities right away.",Halloween
731,andrew-dodge58,Swing and a foul tip.,5,17 April 2019,"In short - the movie wasn't frighting, and Michael is not the methodical murdering machine that he was in the originals. Michael portrays more of a raw form of barbarism, and willy-nilly killings on the fly. It leans more toward a common slasher film direction. If you're a die hard fan of the originals - this version won't satisfy your expectations but, never the less, it's still entertaining to see Michael Meyers killing people in his signature stoic fashion.",Halloween

However, the movie couldn't really decide if it wanted to be a horror or thriller movie and I believe that's what left this movie feeling a little weak overall.We already know that Michael Meyers can't be killed by fire so I'm not sure if Hollywood is being greedy and working toward another unnecessary sequel.Jamie Lee Curtis is still talented, she does a great job in this role. I felt like most of the actors were pretty good except for the obsessed psychiatrist and journalists in the beginning, their parts seemed fake and ill fitted with the story.I just wish they'd surprise me with some intelligent back story, really thought out script and horrific jumps.

737,jmtsund,Avoid at all costs!,3,10 October 2020,"I turned it off after about 40 minutes. I couldn´t stand more of this garbage. John Carpenter must have been paid truck loads of money for agreeing to do the score. The writer and director should be driven out of Hollywood forever! This is just another WOKE-movie. I don´t know why they keep on making them? One thing I do know though; it is not(!) about making great (or even) good films.Info: Michael Myers has become a random killing machine. Killing people here and there whenever he feels like it. Killing spree deluxe. He was never like that in the original. Everything he did, served a ""purpose"". In the original he even hinted some sort of 'humanity', when Tommy Doyle bumps into him at the school yard (after Tommy´s been bullied seconds earlier). He never touched young children. In this piece of garbage..he does! That just sickens me. And of course all males are; wimps, useless, lame and weak. The character of Laurie Strode should be locked up at the same asylum as Michael, as far as I am concerned! Completely deranged, she appears.For me the ""Halloween"" franchise consists of the original, ""HII"" and the much scarier ""H20"". My rating of three stars is for..well, I don´t know? Nostalgia? The music?By the way: ""Halloween III"" is a great little horror movie (to the ""HIII"" haters out there)!",Halloween

It didn't make sense. The idea of taking the original and discounting the sequels was confusing for those of us who have seen the whole series of Halloween movies. Characters were unlikable and quite frankly most were expendable. It was a huge let down for me and I'm sure a lot of Halloween buffs out there.dont waste your time on this one.

741,Richarduck4077,Great to see Jamie Lee Curtis in a good Halloween movie again,6,22 October 2018,"Halloween (2018) is a pleasant surprise I walked into the movie excepting it to be really awful but it wasn't, it was alright. This movie is a well made movie with a lot of flaws, pointless scenes that drag out and useless comedy, there's a scene with two cops just telling each other about their lunch and it was so boring, pointless and unfunny. There were also a lot scenes about a teenager and her school dance and her boyfriend that nobody asked for. Although there are lot of bad parts there are also good parts, Jamie Lee Curtis is back as Laurie Strode and her character was the best part of the movie I love what they did with her character and every scene with her and The Shape (Michael Myers) are the best parts of the movie. The score down by John Carpenter captures the essence of the original and there are so many callbacks and easter eggs to the original. Some times it was annoying but most of the time I loved noticing it and pointing it out. So there's a lot of things I didn't like and a lot of things I did, I do suggest you watch the original first then watch this one.",Halloween

But, people who are looking for a quality storyline or a finished movie with a clear direction will be extremely disappointed.I mostly enjoyed the first half of the movie. The ending was the worst and most pathetic section, which ruined a lot of potential. Do not expect the ending to be better than Halloween Resurrection.The film attempts to be original using an interesting twist, but timidly chooses a plain and boring formula for most of the film. The pathetic attempts at humor were a disaster, and made the film very messy.The film doesn't do much to separate itself from the other sequels. It fails to be unique due to imitating other sequels which are supposed to be ignored. It felt like a lame remake instead of being a new and interesting sequel.Don't get your hopes up. You will need to ignore the unfinished nature of this film in order to enjoy it. The trailer showed images that were never in the movie. Seems like very messy editing.Halloween Resurrection was also bad, but the new movie was almost like The Last Jedi of Halloween films. But, an easily entertained popcorn muncher will enjoy it. It was unoriginal, uncomfortably unfunny, and unfinished. The soundtrack and Jamie Lee Curtis were the best things about this film. Just do not get your hopes up.",Halloween

744,jokeritt,Decent sequel finally,2,15 September 2018,"But still Michael is a bit old 61? lol I would have rather watch a remake from one of Damien Cain's stories and Stevan Mena directing to keep Michael younger and the story modern. There is a lot of off screen kills in this sequel. H20 had a good sense, but hated the score and didn't like the Dawson Creek feel, but the ending of that was justice. The ending to this fell flat. Yes there will be another one. I would have still kept Halloween 2 alive and built off that making this Halloween 3. A lot of good references to the other films. I didn't like the beginning how they remade what happened to Michael after the ending of the first one. They changed the ending.",Halloween
745,jokeritt,Not as good as expected,2,19 October 2018,"Ending is just a rip off to part 2 original. The crazy Dr who kills the sheriff came out of nowhere and his efforts were laughable, trying to figure out what makes Michael kill. No word how the bus crashed also. Jamie Lee Curtis was hard to take seriously. I just didn't see any Suspense tone that the classic had. He just goes for the kills, doesn't stalk. They finally listed 5 people were murdered in part 1, mechanic, 3 teens and Judith. I really couldn't tell if the male document guy was even dead even though his head was bashed into the stall after fighting with Myers to protect his co worker. Damien Cain would have been best choice to remake this old folks home film.",Halloween

Some of the scenes are lifted from the original but pale to the atmosphere and scares of the 1978 film. I was never really bored though, and the pacing was good and I was entertained. So yeah, Halloween is alright, it could have been much better and memorable if it was directed better. Also, I though the comedy was terrible.. but the audience in the theatre where into it.",Halloween
747,murati9,Are you kidding?,5,30 May 2019,"I don't know why Jamie Lee Curtis agree with this movie, must be for the money. They changed the story since she act on The last Halloween. Hollywood people always ruin all the remakes.",Halloween
748,Eric1485,The Halloween We Have Been Waiting For,7,31 October 2018,"Halloween (2018) is able to create its own atmosphere and tone, it does not have the feel of a generic reboot or just another sequel. The atmosphere resembles that of the 1978 classic, while making note of the societal changes that have occurred over the last 40 years. The strength of this film is the impending confrontation between Lauri Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her attacker/brother, Michael Myers. The supporting cast is adequate but they don't bring much substance to the story, and are mostly forgettable characters that are used as convenient plot devices and to fill the audience in with clunky exposition. Luckily, Curtis is still able to carry the bulk of the movie on her shoulders, as she resurrects the terrorized, yet strong lead character that made the original film such a classic. Michael Myers is more savage and barbaric in this film, aimlessly killing most anyone that crosses his path without a clear sense of rhyme or reason. Much like the original, the final act is the strongest and most intense part of the film, and the final result is mostly satisfying. Director David Gordon Green does not try to reinvent the wheel here, he provides us a basic, yet effective slasher movie that is able to stand on its own two feet the entire time. In my opinion, this is the best out of the Halloween sequels, and finishes a distant second to the original source material. I think most Halloween fans, as well as horror fans in general, will appreciate the effort made here to bring another classic Halloween film.",Halloween
749,Robotvideo,"Enjoyable, but could have been more.",6,21 October 2018,"I'm not big fan of slasher movies. I find them to be simplistic and not particularly scary. This episode of Halloween had more depth of character and more story than most of the type making for a better than average slasher movie. However, this was an opportunity to add what every slasher movie cries out for, but never includes: motivation. Why does the killer do what he does. This dimension would have made the story more relatable and more frightening. This question was stated in the movie by Michael's doctor, but it was never answered. If there was follow through on this it would have been a better film. As it was, it made for a good evening at the movies with more of a crime story type ""find the killer before he kills someone else"" plot instead of just running around and screaming. It was refreshing to see Jamie Lee Curtis's character being proactive and doing the hunting of the hunter instead of just being the victim.",Halloween

I can understand that today's viewers don't like it because of all the jump scare cuts in today's trash horror movies. But this is a classic horror movie! No unnecessary splatter, no infinite predictable jump scare cuts, so the audience won't be tired of getting scared after half of the movie. There are many easter eggs for fans regarding the original and apart from a few scenes, I finally found it to be a good horror movie again after IT.Michael Myers is the personified evil. Unlike rob zombie's version, he returns to his roots. We see a psychologically disturbed Laurie that still can't cope with the events of 40 years ago. She has no relationship with her own daughter and granddaughter. She is kept crazy by everyone until Mike Myers actually manages to break out again on Halloween night.

755,starcrowq3,This movie felt a bit overrated,5,6 December 2018,"I went to this movie with the hype around it in my mind. I was sure that I was going to see something special, because of all the great reviews i had read about it. And the movie started out good in an interesting way. You could say that it hooked me in the beginning. But once the action started it just felt like something you have seen a dozens of times. Very predictable slasher that maybe went a bit too much with the original formula that even the scream movies made fun with back in the days. Going back to the roots is one thing, but if you don't add anything new to the tale it ends up predictable and boring for the viewer. And this movie felt much like a redo on H20 but made today. Instead of having the strong lady in distress Laurie Strode of the 90s you got the older stronger women that almost gave me the Wolwerine in Logan feeling. And of course instead of being the sister to Michael Myers we are now back to not being related at all as we all could see already in the trailer. But to me, the sister thing was a better approach to the story. Having a monster like brother that killed your family when you where little and his still haunting for you, feels scarier and also gives Michael Myers a somewhat goal. We still have the question why he does this. But now his just targeting her as a random person. And in this movie we can ask us the question, why didnt she move ?! And would Michael even try to kill her if she wasent there showing up? In H20 we saw a Michael Myers that was doing everything to find his sister, his prey. Here it felt strange, maybe even a plothole to a degree?All in all i think Jamie Lee Curtis did her role good eventho the movie felt a bit rushed and her character is a little here and there at times.

The film, as of writing, garnering a 7.5(/10) IMDb aggregate user rating, is a testament to the power of film industry review flooding and / or lowbrow shilling, as well as an indictment on human intelligence.

Honestly Rob Zombie tried but it wasnt good enough the first was good the second was a flaw but ok but NOT Halloween so if you want to WATCH HALLOWEEN watch the original, part 2 if you want and this one (ignore part 2 completly this is a follow-up to the original) and yes yes yes good movie finally a good sequel!!Thanks",Halloween

761,super-joey,"Disappointing, Forgettable and Maybe A Little Full of Itself",1,20 October 2018,"In 1978, John Carpenter unleashed a horror classic. The story continued a couple years later when he co-wrote/co-produced (and composed the music for) Halloween II. It was a great sequel that picked up where the first movie left off.Ah, remember how that first movie ended? The camera cuts to various locations where the story had taken place as the breathing of Michael Myers takes over the soundtrack. What an ending! It seemed to say, ""The shape is still out there."" He's unstoppable. Right?Well, not according to this new 2018 sequel which ignores Halloween II and claims to be the ""true"" sequel. Now we're told Michael was recaptured that same night before killing anyone else.Wait. What? So the boogeyman was... recaptured? That sort of ruins the magic of that classic ending to the original movie. I don't buy that Michael got shot 6 times, plunged out of a 2nd story window, walked away, then got recaptured.No. The original movie made it clear. The shape is out there. Stalking. Prowling. Murdering. It took the events of the 1981 sequel to bring him down. Shooting both his eyes out and setting him ablaze. In my mind, THAT is what happened that night.But if we are to accept the events of Halloween II, Michael and Laurie Strode are not brother and sister, as that film revealed. I know, I know. John Carpenter has stated in interviews that he never really wanted to do the brother/sister thing. Okay. Whatever. But he still co-wrote/produced the movie that introduced that idea into canon. It seems odd to wipe it out 37 years later. At least Halloween: H20 had the decency to keep Halloween II in the canon so the brother/sister relationship remained.Furthermore, the entire legacy of Dr. Loomis (who returned in 4 sequels to battle Michael) is wiped from canon! Reduced to only the one meeting in 1978 that, we're now told, ended with this unlikely ""recapture"" idea.Okay, okay. I've said my bit about the frustrating, constantly changing canon of the Halloween films. But what about Halloween 2018? Is it at least a good movie?Well, it had some very good moments. All the sequels have had good moments. I'm not sure that justifies wiping everything else out and claiming this as the ""true sequel."" It's not THAT good. It's not a better Part II than Halloween II (1981). In my opinion, it's not even a better sequel than ""Return of Michael Myers."" Yet it callously wipes them out and acts superior. It's not.You get a few suspenseful, well directed scenes. You get some of the better ""funny banter"" in this franchise's history (which improves the scenes with the teenagers, whose dialog in past movies ranged from okay to poor). And you get maybe one or two good kills (and a bunch of forgettable ones).That's about all the good I can say. I left feeling dissatisfied, despite really wanting to love the movie. I paid top price for the best possible screening, hoping it would turn out to be the masterpiece critics and ""early screener"" fans were claiming it to be. But having seen it, I wonder if a lot of fans aren't ""Phantom Menacing."" After all, Carpenter is involved again as one of several producers and one of three composers. They were going back to the original sours and ignoring the lousy Rob Zombie remake. Great!As a result, many fans were proclaiming this ""the best sequel"" several months before it even came out!So we're supposed to cum in our pants because Carpenter endorsed it. I wanted to cum! But I didn't. Other fans did but maybe after the novelty wears off, they'll realize it was a premature ejaculation. See if you still think it's a ""bona fide classic"" in ten years. Remember, MANY fans said the same about H20 when it came out. It was, ""Finally, a real sequel!"" Where are those fans now?Finally, I just gotta say this: Those critics who are saying this movie ""broke new ground"" are clueless. It is NOT the first slasher movie to feature strong female leads with no man rescuing them. I can name SEVERAL classic slashers where the lone surviver was female. It's a common trope. The ""final girl."" So those saying, ""Finally"" and, ""It's about time"" are just ignorant of the genre.Having said that, it was obvious that the filmmakers went out of their way to make sure there were NO strong male characters in this. Not one. Hell, one boy even dresses in drag while his girlfriend dresses as the man. I get it. Men suck. Women are strong. Boys don't need role models. Only women do. Fine. Thank you, Hollywood, for giving us this message for the 1,000th time. And thank you media/critics for ONCE AGAIN acting as if its groundbreaking.",Halloween

766,spikejumper,My review,10,13 October 2021,I loved Halloween 2018 I thought it was amazing and probably the best Halloween sequel I liked how Dr. Sartain is a replacement for Dr. Loomis and how Jamie Lee Curtis cam back to play Laurie.,Halloween
767,wheresjoeysmovie,The Best Sequel,8,23 October 2018,"Halloween (2018)- I just saw the newest Halloween movie tonight and it left me with a lot of personal thoughts and a general uneasiness walking back into the house, checking behind the corner. Being someone who lives with PTSD, I was right there with Laurie Strode during this movie. To have your ""moment"" with those who you need it with that contributed to your PTSD is so important. It can take years or even decades to get that moment and there is so much pain in between. I still have 2 people I need that moment with. 2 people died before I could have my moment. The rest, however, I had my moment to face and succeeded. I won't leave spoilers here and tell you how Laurie's moment goes but I want to say I LOVED this movie.
The movie begins suspenseful and holds that suspense tight throughout. Jamie Lee Curtis gives her very best performance as the Laurie Strode character in this one in my opinion. I would also venture to say this movie is my favorite after the original of all sequels or remakes. It pays homage to many things ""Halloween"" fans hold dear, including a special song towards the end of the ending credits for the HARDCORE fans. This movie holds a special parallel between Michael and Laurie and what brought them to their showdown.
Laurie Strode has paid a lot of prices in her last 40 years since ""that night"", including a very troubled relationship with her daughter, who had to grow up with a mom who is hellbent on never re-living the worst trauma of her life without being prepared and ready to make her own special closure. She has, however, developed a better relationship with her granddaughter, who gives her more of a chance than everyone else does. Every relationship is felt in my opinion.
This movie is definitely a movie that has respect for fans of the original and succeeds in the ways H20 failed. I loved ""Halloween H20"" also but I had some problems with the way the story unfolded and I have pretended the horrible ""Resurrection"" never happened. This situation makes much more sense to me than any other situation previous. This also has characters making logical decisions within the situations presented that are believable (sans a decision at a party). However, there is also much fun to be had and quite a body count. It is still a slasher film also- just more elevated on an empathetic level especially. This movie ignores all sequels and is a direct sequel to the original- 40 years later. However, there are a couple tongue-in-cheek references to a couple of the sequels.
There is a subplot that begins the film and leads things where they are destined to go and I enjoyed how it was handled also. It is almost a wink to all of us and our obsession with Michael Myers for the last 40 years. It lets you think about what would happen if you (as a fan) were to meet the killer yourself! For me, it added to the overall suspense that is unrelenting in certain parts. This feels like Michael Myers and who he was in the original. In a couple scenes (read on the internet where), the original shape (Nick Castle) is Michael in the mask again. The weather of his mask parellels the weather of the skin of Laurie Strode. Time is burned into both of them! As an audience, we wait until their fateful meeting- and it's a hell of a good ride to get there. There is also a welcome amount of humor- but it never takes away from the horror. At least it did not for me! In a franchise that is basically a ""choose your own adventure"" now, this was my favorite adventure apart from the original.I don't want to say much more about the plot. The last thing I will say is I loved it very much and I took something special from it- being someone who battles PTSD. I really don't see how a true horror fan and a true ""Halloween"" fan couldn't love this treasure gifted to us. Now go watch it! It is worth it. In the meantime, I will wait for my ""moment"" with the last 2 people on my list and see how that plays out. We never know why people choose to hurt us severely and sometimes they don't know why they do either. The last thing I will finish with is that anyone who has PTSD knows to watch around every corner of every place you go because you don't know what you're going to face- but you want to be prepared!",Halloween
768,larryct48,Halloween offers a fun ride with Michael Myers,7,21 October 2018,"When I go see a slasher film I want to see kills and gore a lot of gore. On top of that I would like to be engage completely.
Halloween offer me that,
From the moment that they visit Michàel in the mental health prison to when he goes on his killing spree in Halloween.
The killings were creative. Michàel Myers was brutal and pure evil in this one.
Some of my favorite scenes were the baby sit scene.
The scene where You see Michàel waking around the house and later appears inside the house in the same shot without cut.I tried watching the rob zombie Halloween and I thought it was boring, compare to this is engaging, creative and completely fun ride.Grade B",Halloween

Saw this three times in the theater, and while I liked it back then, I was on the fence about a lot of things in the movie. Watched it again last night in the comfort of my own home, and it was a much, much better experience.Overall, the movie does a pretty good job of capturing some of the atmosphere of the original. The lighting of some of the shots and the locations did a pretty good job of capturing that magic.There were a couple big problems with the movie. The first is that even though it did a fairly good job of capturing the atmosphere of the original, the film wasn't really scary or very suspenseful.The final big problem with the movie were the cliches. I was extremely disappointed to find several major horror cliches in this movie. I won't spoil what they are, but think of any stereotypical dumb decision or random act in a horror film, and it's in here.Overall, I would rate it a 7.5. A pretty good movie that came close at times, but just needed a little bit more work to truly live up to its predecessor, or even stand up in its own right.",Halloween

Gone are the stupid reasonings behind Michael's rage, and the far fetched story twists that crushed sequels 5 and 6. Instead we get very solid story telling, a great central performance from Jamie Lee, a wonderful script filled with terror and tension, and the best direction since the first film. I can't stress how great this film is after some pretty lackluster sequels (theatrical cut of 6, and Zombie's Halloween II) . I loved every second of this film from start to finish.

The first twenty minutes of the film could be dumped completely,and, come to think of it, so could the 90 that follow. The writer and director do not have an original idea between them and seen to delights in references to the original and virtually stopping the action to say 'See what I copied from the original there?""Aren't I clever?'

778,dauthier,The only movie I was excited about this year. Was.,4,22 October 2018,"Well, I didn't notice the tension or atmosphere if it was there.Halloween 2, 4 and 6 were able to nail the atmosphere. They are creepy even when the story gets ludicrous.This one rushes through everything with no logic, no characters worth knowing, including the older Laurie strode.
H20 is a fast paced movie too, but is a far superior follow up. It has the elements. This does not.... Once they dropped the Sister storyline they were finally free! They could've taken it absolutely anywhere.
I assumed Laurie would hunt him while he was doing other things. Why was SHE a special revenge for him? The story doesn't explain this.The Loomis replacement was okay, until he wasn't a real character anymore. He becomes absurd then forgotten immediately.The Podcaster story line was bad too, then gets ridiculous and unrealistic. Although if Laurie had gone along with them it would have been a better story.A slower movie, with a lot less going on, leaving room for tension and suspense would have been much more appreciated.
It could have been great, but it just isn't. Not at all. Such a letdown.I'll still hold hope for a Directors cut that includes character development and a story that makes sense.",Halloween
779,capaldimark,Michael Myers is back,8,27 October 2018,"In 1978, John Carpenter forever changed the horror movie genre with Halloween, a movie that soon became a classic and sparked many sequels and even a remake, most of them being rather mediocre. Fast forward 40 years, and now we have David Gordon Green's Halloween, which is a direct sequel to the original Halloween with this one taking place 40 years later and ignoring all of the sequels, including Halloween 2. Although this movie doesn't quite reach the heights of the original, it is probably the best Halloween movie since Halloween 2.As noted above, Halloween picks up 40 years after the events of the 1978 murders, with serial killer Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney) imprisoned ever since. Michael is soon transferred to another prison, but the bus he is on crashes and Michael escapes, which prompts him to return to Haddonfield to hunt down Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the survivor of Michael's rampage 40 years earlier. We find out that Laurie has been living with post-traumatic stress disorder ever since her encounter with Michael, and has gone to extreme lengths to protect herself and her family from his inevitable return, much to the dismay of her daughter, Karen (Judy Greer), and her granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak), who find Laurie to be too controlling and crazy. Michael soon goes on a killing spree, setting up a final showdown between him and Laurie which has been building up for years. There are some twists and turns along the way, including one that was downright odd and a bit silly, but overall it is a pretty straightforward movie that is easy to follow and includes certain nods and references to previous Halloween movies that many fans of the franchise will enjoy and appreciate. While it was certainly cool to see that, there were times when those references seemed a little forced and out of place, almost like the writers just included them to please diehard fans without really thinking too much about how they fit into the scene.What made the original Halloween such a classic is how it delivered its thrills. Instead of predictable jump scares and excessive gore, Carpenter used suspense and atmosphere to get under your skin. Director David Gordon Green goes back to the basics and does the similar thing here, creating horror through atmosphere and building suspense through it, and he mostly succeeds. Although the movie wasn't quite as scary as I hoped it would be, there were a few parts that were undeniably intense and creepy. And this wouldn't be possible without good performances from the cast, with a particularly strong performance from Jamie Lee Curtis portraying a traumatized Laurie Strode.All in all, David Gordon Green and his team go back to the basics and lay the foundation on how to craft a good, modern slasher horror film. It's not perfect and wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, but it does have its moments and is good enough to rank as one of the year's best horror movies. It's good to know that the Halloween franchise is finally in good hands again.",Halloween
780,KingTambo,This is a Generic slasher with all respect to the franchise removed.,3,21 February 2019,"A big problem is that they made Michael not care about Jamie Lee and she is obsessed with him. He is just a mindless killer, killing who or whatever with no motive and yet she is setup like he is the smarter, motive driven Michael from the past installments. It's a mess. And with him just being a mindless maniac(how they changed the story) it makes no sense that there was ever a brilliant Loomis to be fixated on him, and to mentor a new Doctor (the 1 in the movie) to continue an obsession with a run of the mill mindless violent person. It's just stupid. No myth, no nothing. Just a guy who killed 5 people 40 years ago. Who is mindless and violent. The only thing that made this movie not just be called 'Slasher' to make it a Halloween movie is the mask, Jamie Lee, some music, and Haddonfield. Everything else is just generic. The fact they want to ignore the whole franchise except the first film and make Jamie Lee be so driven to the point of mental illness against someone who hasn't harmed a fly in 40 years is just absurd. They play off the strength and hallmarks of the series like music and mask, and then make the most un Halloween, Halloween movie.

We've already seen. they should have at least, added new story but it's the same old thing done four Previous times. It doesn't feel like a Halloween film the look isn't Good. the score isn't memorable accept, a piece or two lame Humor that doesn't fit. a pointless twist that means nothing. the mad doctor was nothing more than a Dr. Wynn rip-off from Halloween the Curse of Michael Myers. Laurie Strodes family were pointless, penis jokes. Michael Myers getting his ass Kicked easily and where, were the traps they were promoting she had there were none.

It far surpassed my expectations. It did what I wanted it to, and then some. It made Michael Myers scary again. For the first time since 1981 he's scary. And I mean he's terrifying. He's a brute force of nature. He's completely unstoppable. And Laurie Strode- she's a badass. This is the fair fight between these two icons- the iconic killer, and the iconic scream queen- we've been waiting for. It was extreme nostalgia override. It was the Halloween movie I'v been waiting for. It went back to the basic, and although it was way more violent than any of its predecessors, it was the scariest since the original. It was excellent, and I'm looking forward to the next chapter in this series that has been given new life, and another chance.

785,tristenjones-74208,"Doesn't fully live up to the hype, but good watch (SPOILERS!)",7,1 November 2018,"Now ever since Rob Zombie's reboot series came to light, everyone wondered if we'd see another Halloween movie again. Even bigger question, would Jamie Lee Curtis return? Since that was announced in 2016, everyone who was a horror fan got excited, knowing that the classic horror roots of Michael Myers would soon be returning. Did it exactly live up to it's hype? Somewhat, yes.For one, Laurie Strode is what you'd expect, someone who's paranoid that Michael would come back after all many years of waiting. And the characters that follow Laurie (Her mother Karen and Granddaughter Allyson) are good additions to the Strode family.Michael Myers hasn't changed a bit, well he has changed somethings a bit, for one he actually doesn't kill any dogs (for once) and has stepped out of his comfort zone and actually kills a kid (which yes, despite his homicidal nature, he doesn't go after kids, besides Jamie, but never mind that). In fact, the kills in this movie are even more gruesome than any of the others (that's right, move over Rob Zombie), and are slightly a big more creative.Now while this film has it's moments, it also disappoints in some ways. For example, what this film didn't do what all the others did is that it didn't cut to the chase right away. So at first, you're wondering when Michael will strike, and it leaves you impatient. Also, what the original film did great that this film didn't is that, you knew Michael was around, you knew where he was, you just don't know his next move. This film, however, you know almost his every move and it's so predictable knowing what he's going to do next. Like you know what he's going to do, and it ruins the element of surprise. The worst thing about the movie in my opinion however is Ranbir Sartain, who is Michael's psychiatrist after Loomis' passing. I don't like how he's referred to as a 2nd Loomis, but then (SPOILER!) tries to help Michael continue his killing spree or reunite with Laurie Strode. It's basically spitting on Donald Pleasance's character.But overall, this movie is a great watch, check it out. A little Michael Myers nostalgia wont hurt. Especially in a good film like this.7/10.",Halloween

First, it totally skips over all the other sequels. Yes, I've heard that before. But I figured if they did it well, it wouldn't matter. They did not do it well. Second, they get a writer/director who has never done horror before. He had no sense of suspense or mystery. I'd have to check what he has do e before but is was probably mediocre, at best. Thirdly, it goes at least 30 minutes before there's a kill. And that's a flashback from the original. Most of the kills happen off screen. And those are pretty lame. With all the advances of CGI and make-up, you'd think they would be a bit more creative. And lastly, it follows a very, very, very similar plot line to the original.

I really bought into all the promises made by the filmmakers that they were going to honor the original and go back to the terrifying vibe John Carpenter once created. Pretty sure they meant they were just going to copy the Rob Zombie quick-cut, loud, obnoxious style instead. About a few minutes into this mess, the British podcaster (why is he British?) holds up the mask Michael Myers' wore during his killing spree saying the district attorney gave it to him. I had no idea that if you were a podcaster, you could just walk up a district attorney and ask for a crucial piece of evidence from a notorious murder case and he'll cough it up no prob. (I got dibs on John Wayne Gacy's clown costume) That was just the first of many, many ""huh?"" moments in this shameless cash grab of a ""reboot"". John Carpenter's original was a stark, realistic, tense horror film that gripped you with it's stripped down terror and menacing vibe. This soulless bloated Hollywood take makes even Halloween II look like a masterpiece, and I'm talking about the Zombie version. It's hard to believe Carpenter had any kind of input on this, although his last couple of films have unfortunately misfired as well so perhaps he did contribute. I won't even get into how they ruined Laurie Strode's character. Just avoid this at all costs and just watch the actual Halloween II (1981) instead, which (bad wig aside) really doesn't get enough credit for continuing the same feel of the first film.",Halloween

799,girlluver1,A classic Reborn,8,2 November 2018,"If you are looking for the gratuitous nudity, excessive blood and gore, teenagers partying and drinking being the center plot. Then don't go see this movie. If you are a fan of the original Halloween much like I am, go see this movie. I have to pay my absolute respects to David Gordon Green and Danny McBride for reviving and paying tribute to one of the greatest slashers of all time. The writing and the portrayal of all the characters is on point. This film not only brought back to life what made the original so great, it added several new elements that brought together an almost masterpiece. Now I know for those of you who read my review will see the word ""almost"" and get nervous. But do not let it worry you. The almost in question is a minor attempt at an unnecessary plot twist. I will not give the details here. But I promise that Michael resolves the issue in a very bad ass way. Even though not all of the gore is depicted on screen there's still plenty of it. Michael Myers is still an unstoppable force who will let no one get in the way of his task. The character Laurie Strode (Jaime Lee Curtis) is much more accurately depicted in this film than she is the other sequels in which she appeared in. After the trauma that she witnessed on that Halloween 40 years ago, there is little need for the imagination as to why she becomes the way she does. I do not need to express the way I feel about the two men who play Michael Myers. I am not saying Michael Myers is an easy character to portray. But like in the past they made Michael the soulless unfeeling character that he is. There isn't much I would have be different in this movie, other than the small scene that I mentioned earlier and maybe just a little more on screen brutality. Other than that fantastic movie for those who love the real and original Michael.",Halloween

The look of Michael in this aged mask gives the nostalgia feel to the film.
It book ends the new story line.
Will definitely watch this again.",Halloween
801,david-626-148063,One extremely huge disappointment,1,30 October 2018,"This is unfortunately the really final proof: Hollywood is only - only - about the bucks. No one can be proud of this disaster.John Carpenter has sold what he had left of his soul. And the movie turned out even worse than The Nun. I really had high hopes on Halloween, esp. after hearing about good reception at the Toronto film festival. But nothing is good about this film. And the only reason for Mr. Carpenter to put his name onto this, as Executive Producer and Composer, must be the money. Even the iconic intro score (with the piano, as in the 1978 original) is ruined by supplying it with an additional drum machine. He ought to be ashamed of himself.But most of all - and once again - a really bad script and storyline ruin what potentially could have been a good sequel. Nothing, really nothing fits; there is no logic or credibility whatsoever in what happens as the story goes by. If you have seen the trailers, there is no secret that the bus with Michael Myers crashes and that he flees. This part is without any credibility whatsoever. And what then happens in Haddonfield - I guess everyone of us could have written a better script than this misery. And the perhaps biggest disappointment of all is the home fortress that Laurie Strode has had many years to prepare. This is really, really bad and doesn't work at all; say goodbye to all logic. And where is the police when you need it? And I am not going to give away any spoiler about Myer's doctor, but what he ends up doing - that is the lowest of all points in the film. Hollywood, please give us a break!!It will be a long time until the next possibility that I will give a Hollywood sequel. They should be ashamed of themselves and how us cinema fans are exploited. My tip: do NOT see this film. Do not support this garbage.PS: I was 15 when the original Halloween film came and I have loved that ever since (of course, it is no longer that scary, compared to watching it as a teen). I just wish I didn't watch the 2018 debacle ...",Halloween
802,sean-sumner,"How to bring back a slasher icon, New Line and Paramount take note!",8,22 October 2018,"For me this is how to bring back a slasher icon, New Line and Paramount take note! Not the scariest by any means however the movie is so much more in terms of suspense, character development (especially Laurie's journey - heart wrenching at times) and making Michael Myers one deeply creepy sinister killer, well and truly returning both him and the franchise to its roots. A must watch for horror/slasher fans in general as well as fans of the original!",Halloween
803,chrisbarker187,Amazing!!!,9,28 December 2018,"This is by far the best Halloween since the original. From start to finish, it felt so fresh yet true to the original and the sequels. The atmosphere, story, kills but most importantly the score were all great. Filled with gruesome kills as well, it felt like a true slasher flick.Michael especially was portrayed perfectly. The look and movement was spot on. There were many likeable characters. The feel of the film felt really dark and atnospheric, the way Halloween should be.The score is fantastic. They were right to bring back Carpenter. It's very intrigueing in a way that it feels new and modern, yet old school at the same time. The synth music surrounded by the very dark sounding electric guitar and bow instruments (I'm pretty sure it was maybe a violin) creating such an intense atmosphere and every piece of music fit with the film very well. One piece in particular titled ""The Shape Hunts Allyson"" is by far my favourite theme (besides the official theme of course). It sounded so retro with the synth, very reminiscent of Christine. And again, with the Electric Guitar and Strings, it fit perfectly and made the scene one of the most intense in the film.As for other things like the story, acting, characters etc. They are all strong aspects of the film. You could really see how broken down Laurie's life had become after the events of '78. Dealing with PTSD and living such a heavily secured life was a great way to enphasise the aftermath of it all.The opening scene and credits were intense and very refreshing. The way the credits were done was absolutely incredibly and smart on their part. The image of the destroyed pumpkin coming back to life is a great metaphor for the franchise being brought back to life.The first half of the film is probably my favourite. Seeing Michael unmasked and showing the marks and scars that had been left from 40 years ago, felt so nostalgic and it was very cool seeing that. I like the fact you can barely see Michael's face or can only see parts of his face from certain angles, so it leaves a hint of ambiguity to it. One scene in particular that I thought was very ballsy but also very well done, was when Michael kills the child in the van. It showed that Michael truly is pure evil and has absolutely no remorse or empathy for any living thing.
The Gas Station sequence was also enjoyable and yet again showed Michael's brutality. The teeth, from the Attendant he killed, being dropped over the bathroom stall, was something new and ultimately terrifying.Of course, not every film is perfect, and Halloween hit a major flaw nearing the end. The entire sequence with Dr. Sartain, while ambitious, was a big flop. The fact that Michael even got robbed of a kill is annoying enough. I shook my head when I saw this in theatres. I wanted to like what I saw, but I just couldn't. Thankfully, this sequence only lasts several minutes.I thought the ending was great also, although seemed it could have gone on a little bit longer and could have been a bit more intense. Michael being trapped in the cellar, surrounded by flames, whilst the music was playing in the background, had almost an emotional affect on me. It was as if Michael was accepting his fate after everything he had bern through. I was a little shocked when the credits came up as I was expecting a little bit more but in the end I was happy.Overall, I feel all the hate it recieves is purely unjustified and completely unfair. If you simply do not like it, that's fine, but it is FARRRRRRR from ""terrible"", ""awful"", ""boring"" or ""the worst"". The main reason many hate this film, is because they walked into the theatre with low expectations and the intent to dislike it. However, box office and critical acclaim says otherwise. I love the film and I think it is by far the best sequel to date. And there is a lot to support that claim.",Halloween
804,Reverend3000,Overrated and Overhyped,4,4 November 2018,"The final fight out was suspenseful, and it was fun to see a badass version of Laurie Strode, but it could not redeem the rest of the movie.
The opening scene at the prison=cheesy.
The inflatable pumpkin opening credits= beyond cheesy. (I did laugh out loud in the theaters)
There were too many characters introduced throughout the film with no closure given to some of them. Some of the twists were truly surprising but not all were convincing (like the whole short lived psychiatrist-as-second-antagonist twist. There was no point to even inserting that into the story.) The dialogue was embarrassingly bad at many points as well.
I do not get why this is being hyped as such an exceptional sequel. (Though of course being an ""exceptional"" Halloween movie isn't really saying much.) The 1978 original is a classic. Then as we all know, it was over-sequelized, and like other horror franchises, were mostly laughably bad movies in themselves (money makers, as people knew they were bad but still enjoyed the thrills). I honestly would consider this film more of that. It was better than other Halloween movies (but again, that's not saying much). But honestly, I would put it on the same par as the 2007 Rob Zombie remake (enjoyable at parts but not a good movie). I would even say Halloween 4 was better than this.
Go see it for the several thrills, but dont believe the hype. I cant believe Carpenter himself is looking at this film like it's so great. He should know better.",Halloween

806,kevinlloyd-26393,Honours the original with very little to offer,3,14 June 2021,"Pays homage to the originals, but otherwise has a weak and almost entirely predictable premise and story. Ridden with cliches, stupid decisions, bad writing, and typical jump scares.A clear cash grab and easy pay day for Curtis.Offers very little to the franchise, besides new blood to pass the torch to, whenever they decide to do that.Most of it is a slow burn filler with an unsatisfactory ending.",Halloween
807,jds-14876,Brings back the true spirit of Halloween,10,16 January 2019,By no means does this touch the original first and though it was made to disregard the original second I will always love the original second. But to me this ranks as the third best Halloween of them all. And I am sure many who love Zombie's versions probably hate this. But to me Zombie in my own opinion made Michael Myers a white trash wallmart brand version. I loved how they really fallowed the original. Without saying I do wish they did not scrape the original second but I can pretend it is the third of the Michael Myers and Laurie story. Just so many witty parallels and the man himself John Carpenter approved this. So that is very cool.,Halloween
808,moverton-93588,Intense,5,30 August 2019,Ok so I jumped and screamed a few times. Good movie from a shock point of view but the storyline was a bit weak and unbelievable. I thought this was supposed to be the last movie. Left me thinking another one is imminent!,Halloween

They made their money off the masses and unfortunately off of me.. The whole movie is unforgettable but some things stood out . boring and same storyline as before , over the top gruesome kills for no reason? Loud sounds effects to make it ""scary"" I noticed strong gender fluid feminist agendas being pushed down our throats again through mainstream . A red neck boy in his truck with his dad that may be a girl? Complains about not going o dance class. Boyfriend and granddaughter go to dance as Bonnie and Clyde but you guessed she's dressed as Clyde and he is Bonnie plus he has feminem features . Some stoner dude that's very weak and feminem . All the men die at the end of the movie literally . The 3 women including Jaime lee Curtis do some ""times up"" me too BS against Michael Myers and over come his forthcomings. ...... PUKE im all about people doing what you want to do l, but why can't you make movies NEUTRAL get it? And stick to the story and leave whatever political trope popular at the moment I'm society. I'll never watch it again. They'll make a new one in 2050 for the next generation to rip them off Michael Myers will be in a wheel chair all burnt up chasing people .",Halloween

That is it, there is nothing more good thing that i've got to say about this movie. I am going to be brutal like Michael Myers.If a movie has doesn't make sense lines, scenes and charecters, it means that the script is bad. This movie is full of it with those. We all love and respect the first Halloween movie but come-on, is in it enough that you ruined it? Okay lets not see the bad script and look for directing and acting. First i ought to point that noticing a bad directing is way easy than noticing the bad acting. You basically feel the bad directing during the movie, it bothers you. And Halloween 2018 has it all, bad acting and bad directing. Lets not be that cruel and took out the bad acting, it was eh.I have a one final question, how in the world a short-old man can put someone who is two times bigger than his size into car with ONLY one hand?

814,culmo,Disappointed,6,11 October 2019,"I love the Halloween franchise. I'll even watch ... sigh ... when Bust-a-rhymes is battling Michael Myers. And I fully admit how bad each successful sequel got. And I fully agree that the Rob Zombie films were a disaster.But I expected so much from Halloween 2018. This film is definitely of a higher caliber than anything that has come before in terms of production quality, cast and cast ... very similar to H20. But I was disappointed.First, the good:
The music ... oh the music is the best Halloween score, I dare say, since the original. John Carpenter and crew really nail the music with the synth and the spooky tones. The soundtrack alone bumps this film up a star in my book.The cast all do a commendable job, though I thought Will Patton's role was underused.The tension in the final act is definitely there. They nailed that. When Laurie is hunting the Shape through the house, your eyes are glued to the screen.The Mask. A lot of the masks in the sequel were downright silly. This mask is perfect.
The Bad:The teen characters teen too hard. A lot of the teenager scenes just felt overdone. The great part about the original Halloween is that the teens all were very authentic. The teens in this film were more like a 45 year old's take on how teens act these days.The executive decision to excise ALL material from the sequels and make this a direct sequel to the original. Here me out. Yes, the sequels really made a mess with the contrived storylines involving family and Laurie dying but not dying, then dying again, she had a daughter, no she had a son ... oh and there was some cult that made Michael evil. Making a cohesive story while keeping all that would have been near impossible. But ... to completely ignore it brought out a major problem. Michael Myers loses his gravity as a mass-murdering monster.
Yes, I can buy that Laurie would be traumatized by her encounter with the Shape. She most likely would have PTSD and become an alcoholic and have deep psychological issues. All that was great character development. But why would teens in Haddonfield, 40 years later, know or care about Michael Myers? He killed his sister when he was a kid and then killed 4 people as an adult (according to this new timeline). So what? There's even one teen character who suggests as much, who brings up this plot point, but it is just dismissed as ""dude, her grandmother was almost killed."" No, no, you still need to explain why everyone is so obsessed with Michael Myers? Why are British podcasters interested in him? They're award-winners, after all, why go to a small Illinois town to get a story on an old murderer from 40 years ago? You get what I'm saying? By removing the yearly rampages of death that Michael inflicted throughout the sequels, you reduce Michael to just a common criminal.Then there's the fact that by removing the supernatural element to Michael, you need to explain how Michael could recover from getting shot 6 times (or even fewer). HE was also stabbed in the neck, had an eye gouged out, and was stabbed in the chest BEFORE Loomis put six slugs in his chest. That's what made the ending of the original so great ... oh my God, this guy is unstoppable!
So he's not supernatural (or maybe he is, who knows) He then is able to exist in maximum security prison and after 40 years of no exercise, he's strong enough to overpower anyone? You see what I'm getting at here?The point is, by removing ALL the material from the sequels, you reduce Michael Myers to nothing, and yet this movie's whole premise is dependent on the legacy of those sequels.Okay, enough of that.I still enjoyed the film. It has its moments, it has its charm. I would rank it as 3rd or 4th in terms of Halloween films.",Halloween
815,maddiaj,I almost want my money back,4,13 November 2018,"Just got back from Halloween in the cinemas very disappointed there were 5 other people in the cinema so maybe that should have been a clue. I never watch horror movies I get too scared and just can't stand them but the trailer for this one looked so good and the reviews were so good that I gutted up and took a chance. Oh my god the movie was laughable in fact we actually were laughing in the end it was very bad.
The first scene where the investigation reporters were taughting Michael with the mask and it got very climatic I thought here we go this is gonna be good and then cut to the old school style opening credits I enjoyed that they kept with the original film and kept that connection but from there it went downhill very fast, the film actually got boring I was bored.
The jump scares were predictable and you knew when they would happen because every single one of them were in the trailer EVERY ONE! So I knew when they were going to occur and at the exact moment because I had seen them in the trailer. I felt as though Micheal Myers needed to speak even if it was a few words or even a great one liner to Laurie, something but he didn't say anything for the entire movie not one word and we didn't see his face which I get they are trying to keep him mysterious but he needed to say a parting defeated word as he stared up at Laurie when he was going to burn or something he needed to say something! Even the dialogue that was said in this film was very basic and you would just go eh? What why did we need that useless information? Or wow that was poor writing really that was the best they could think of.
Films when they get older begin to look dated and become corny and laughable because it's so obvious and badly done - because it's an old film. Halloween (2018) was made in 2018 but it felt like it was made back in 1978 it felt like it was an old dated movie. There was a scene where the Allyson was surrounded by Laurie's maniquens that she had shot over the years and the camera would dramatically zoom into the face of the maniquen and then back to Allyson's face and it would move back and forth between each maniquen it was sooo bad!! Oh my god! It was a massive laugh moment so corny.
When the kid that was getting babysat saw that Micheal was stabbing and murdering his babysitter surely an actual kid that age or any age if they saw that they would be screaming, so why did that kid in the movie just yell one word and then ran out and we never saw him again that was it I mean it just wasn't realistic. Not mentioning the fact that Micheal Myers must be made of steel I mean he got shot in the shoulder by Laurie, his fingers shot off and then in the final showdown on the stairs down to the basement he must have been shot, stabbed 10 different times and yet he was still alive going strong not to mention that he didn't let out a single yell or scream. He was also incredibly strong but incredibly weak at the same time, he was able to push a car seat fully forward to kill his Doctor and was able to destroy a human head by stomping on it but yet when fighting Laurie all she did was push him off with her hand and that was enough he was off she was able to fight him off even with his strength.
The movie was predictable because too much was shared in the trailer and then it was also predictable because you could always tell what was about to happen I'm not sure what the people who are giving this film 8,9,10 rating or 4 out of 5 stars were watching but surely we haven't watched the same film because what I saw was not good. This movie is being really Over-Hyped don't waste your money or time it's not worth it. I'm really disappointed I was actually looking forward to have a good scare even though I don't like horror movies but boy was I let down, all these talk show hosts saying that they were terrified and watching with one eye or covering their eyes out of fear- come on! Surely not!!! I have a low tolerance for scary movies but not once was I scared enough to cover my eyes and through the whole movie we never figured out or discovered what actually made Micheal tick what made him the way he was or do the things he does. Really disappointed really really disappointed :(",Halloween

Ever since John Carpenter introduced the world to Michael Myers (not to be confused with the actor who played Austin Powers) his ""Psycho""-influenced movie in 1978, it's been one of the most important parts of US popular culture. After a few crummy entries in the series, it brought back Jamie Lee Curtis in 1998's ""Halloween: H20"" (in which her horror veteran mom co-starred), which retconned* the events of parts 4-6 out of the series.So now we have the latest ""Halloween"". This is a good one. A direct sequel to the 1978 movie, it depicts Laurie going to great lengths to protect her daughter and granddaughter from Myers.

819,ianxmas,"No tension, so predictable",3,4 February 2019,"Let me be upfront and say I never saw the original and so I am reviewing this as a stand-alone film and not as some sort of 'homage to a past masterpiece'. Such a disappointment. The cast was strong, Jamie Lee's granite-like character was excellent and the cinematography was great but the storyline......was soooo hackneyed and obvious, and so full of daft inconsistencies and devoid of tension. You could see everything coming. The British podcasters (let loose in an ultra-high-security mental institution with no credentials or letter of introduction? Oh sure!) were marked for death right from the start, so zero surprise when it came shortly afterwards. Transporting a lethal homicidal maniac in a bus with one elderly prison guard? C'mon: we've all seen Fugitive so you just KNOW he's going to escape from the bus. The granny-mother-daughter thing? My wife, after sighing at the obviousness of the whole film, casually said about a third of the way through ""The daughter's going to kill him"" , and so it came to pass. The cops come across the unresponsive car of their colleagues. Oh gosh, I wonder what's going to happen No!! They all die! Wow: didn't see that coming! The final scenes on the house: three competent shooters with an arsenal of weapons, and yet the constantly fail even to have a gun in their hand, let alone put up a concentrated barrage, so that the 'tension' (not!) can be spun out. So I'm sorry; this is not being pernickety about small detail, this is saying that this is a shallow film where the vast majority of the plotline is blindingly obvious and thoroughly contrived, thus robbing the film of any build-up or tension. It could have been a great film, but the director robbed the cast of that opportunity.",Halloween

Halloween Kills
Halloween EndsLike there's already a remake called Halloween also... and this one ignores those remakes and everything after the original Halloween. So why not just call this one Halloween Returns or something, it's really not tough to come up with a subtitle. Halloween Kills doesn't make much sense but at least it's different from Halloween.Lots of cliches like ""see there's nothing there"" oh actually there was something there omg. And movies nowadays that need to use loud sound effects to make it scarier just are pretty cheap to me. The thing about Halloween is it was always like decently realistic, I mean this movie could happen in reality as opposed to Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm St or Child's Play...But what's so unrealistic is that Michael seems to literally be immortal, he's strong as hell despite not getting any exercise his entire life and being 60 years old. And the Haddonfield authorities must be the worst crime unit on the planet.Anyways, obviously this movie isn't trying to be perfect or logical, it's a slasher film, if you like those then definitely worth watching, but probly won't stand out in your mind much. As unnecessarily filthy as the Rob Zombie remake was, it at least stuck in my memory because of how nauseating and realistic some of the violence was.

Jermey Lee Cutis also gives a great preformance as Laurie Strode. The film lacks however, in foucusing more on the teenagers school dance instead of the character that we acually care about Laurie. I found the teens annoying, and just a waste of screen time so Michael could get some more kills. When the final fight does come down however, it's very intense between Michael and Laurie. After the fight, the film gives a typical horror cash cow ending, so yeah there is definitely a sequel :( At the end of the day though, Halloween may suffer from it's annoying minor characters, but it excels in bringing closure to the 40 year story of Michael and Laurie Strode.",Halloween

837,nikosxen,"Had a good premise, but ultimately felt flat",5,27 October 2018,"So I am a big fan of the original movie.I love Mike Myers as a villain. He doesn't have a grandiose purpose, he doesn't speak at all, he doesn't show anywhere any kind of emotion.Essentially he represents total evil, a modern Boogeyman. And I love the fact that the premise is so simple and not convoluted. What I really like about this movie was how Mike was portrayed, 40 years after the original events. He was an old man,wrinkled, thin (not humongous like in the Rob Zombie movie) but still so imposing. I loved the fact that you could actually witness his transformation but you never get to see his real face. And during the movie, you can just feel that there is no purpose to his actions, his is just an evil killing machine, set out after forty years to continue doing what he does best. I also liked the mask, it is probably the best mask I've seen throughout the whole series. It felt old and tattered but still creepy and it fitted perfectly with the character. And that's about it when it comes to the positives.
My biggest problem with this movie is the characters. Besides the family, all of them, and I mean literary all of them are just stupid plot devices for the movie to move forward. They have no actual depth, no intelligence, no purpose, no nothing, they are just there conveniently in order to advance the plot, but it is so obvious and blunt that it gets frustrating. Also some of them are so absurd and unfit. Especially the dad character. WHY? Who thought that putting cringe worthy dad jokes in a Halloween movie as a comic relief would be a good idea? Why is every movie obligated to have comic relief? It really pisses me off. The three women of the movie are kind of ok I guess. I mean really dont buy the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis just turned on full commando mode after all those years, it seemed a bit stupid to be honest but I guess that at some point it is explained by the main psychiatrist who mentions that people cope with psychological trauma in different ways. But I think it could be handled much better and deeper. Mom and daughter were decent, nothing really different from other similar horror movie roles.
As for the plot itself, it was kind of a disappointment, mainly because it started off with a good premise, finding out what has happened to Michael 40 years later and I honestly thought that it would have a much darker and more sinister direction. But it ended up being a typical horror-slasher movie with no thrills, couple of clever shots, non existing plot, boring characters and a cool depiction of Michael.
Overall I guess you can call this a crowd pleaser movie, I am pretty sure that people are going to have a good time with it, and I guess it's ok in that sense, going into a theater watching a slightly stupid slightly entertaining horror movie, munching pop corn and then immediately forgetting about it. But I really think that this movie could have taken a much more interesting direction, especially with John Carpenter being involved.",Halloween

841,ridinhighford351,BY FAR THE BEST SEQUEL IN THE HALLOWEEN FRANCHISE!,10,31 October 2018,"Halloween 2018 was BY FAR the BEST sequel in the Halloween franchise in my opinion. It had the perfect atmosphere and the musical score couldn't have possibly been any better. It has one of the best soundtracks that I've heard in a long time to be honest and set the tone for the movie. It was shot beautifully and was a perfect mixture of old and new. You could tell that both John Carpenter and David Gordon Green really cared for how this movie turned out and wanted to show fans that a proper slasher movie can still be made in 2018. He wanted to pay proper homage to John Carpenter's classic.
In other words, I could tell I was watching a Halloween movie all the way through just from the style and unease that the movie projected.
If you know the original Halloween well enough you'll catch some familiar names and little nods to the original. Just some little Easter eggs for us OG fans.
It went above and beyond anything I could've expected!! Even made me jump 2 or 3 times.
People are complaining about the comedic scenes in certain parts of the film. Personally I think it gives the characters a more realistic touch. A loving family that jokes with each other, a couple cops poking fun at each other, a baby sitter and kid messing with each other. IT'S NORMAL! They actually make you care for the characters and what happens to them. Plus it gives a good break in between the intense scenes! Think of it as a horror filled roller coaster.
Other people were getting into it just as much as I was in the theater. Clapping at certain points and cheering. I haven't had that much fun at a movie in a long time!
In conclusion, if you're looking for a good horror movie to see this Halloween season, go see it!!!",Halloween
842,doeman87,What year is it???,4,19 October 2018,"I can't believe how disappointing this was. The unreal amount cliches and questionable choices made throughout this film gave me a headache. Yes, I was massaging my head towards the end. Several times throughout the movie the audience collectively said ""huh?"" or ""what??"" during specific scenes (sock. nuff said). There's such an obvious lack of common sense wherever this movies' location takes place. People undoubtedly deserved to die here. And don't get me started on the tween love drama scenario thrown in. WHO CARES.It's not scary either. Don't go in expecting that. Halloween has always been more of a slasher film and this changes nothing. Best you'll get is a handful of crappy jump scares... Aside from that, the movie tries to be funny, but rarely succeeds. 90% of the actors who try injecting their dry comedy into this movie only leaves you wanting to cave their face in.There are very little positives I can give to this movie. It's shot well, the setting is nice and the actor for Michael Myers is ruthless (intimidating as well... the way he just stands there), but in the end it's a disappointing snorefest with little payoff. Nostalgia did absolutely nothing to save this for me.",Halloween

There were mistakes as all of them have, such as illogicalities, bad character reactions, terribly made death scenes, but that's just what slashers are. It did have jumpscares, but it didn't have that many, nor were all loud noises, and weren't even the meat of the movie anyway. It felt as if it was just something on top of the cake. Specifically, there was a scene close to the end where a quick zoom to the character's faces, the dialogues, and the illumination made for a very artistic and satisfying moment. You can clearly see the switch between Michael persecuting that poor broken family and then Michael being persecuted by people who know how to fight back. The soundtrack was milking the main few notes of the original with a bunch of added sounds, but it was never out of place, just a bit dull.",Halloween
845,dance_orluck,Highly Suggested!,10,19 October 2018,"I'm someone who loves the horror genre and specifically slasher films. These films are the ones that can still get me to jump or double check to make sure my doors are locked prior to going to bed as an adult. The Halloween series has always been one that held a special place in my heart, and this addition is NOT a let down. Now onto my why...1) If you have minimally seen the very first Halloween you will appreciate how they stylistically started the film. I personally thought it was a great way to pull the audience in, and get us to feel the way we did when we were younger watching Halloween for the first time.2) Unlike past Halloween movies or traditional slasher films there is a good balance in between running from Michael and prepairing for his capture. I personally think the feel is more psych thriller with a horror vibe.3) I loved that the varied scares/jumps planned out even had adult men jumping out of their seats in the theater. I just smiled.4) I felt unlike other Halloween movies there they slowly add details to draw you in; this movie pulled you in from the beginning.5) I don't know many horror movies that have plot twists, and I thought the ones this movie had were good.6) They incorporated some comedic relief which actually made you LOL.The only things I might change...1) The movie is suppose to follow the first Halloween... however Halloween 2 is the continuation of that night. I feel like they should have honored that when creating this movie.2) I wish some of the guys hair cuts were different. They actually bothered me... maybe they are trendy and I just don't know it?Overall I think it's a great movie that will suck you in and have you entertained through out. I can't wait to see it again!",Halloween

The conclusion was as expected and although their was an occasional gasp for air it didn't produce any hard hitting scares.On a positive note the occassional use of Nick Castle as the Shadow, the iconic Halloween music and the opening titles replicating the original make this feel like a Halloween movie. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a strong performance as a nervous wreck with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome and the countless nods to all previous Halloween films still make this an enjoyable watch for all the loyal fans but if you are a horror veteran you will see it's cracks.Mike Myers still lingers in the shadows of 1978.",Halloween
847,jac-44480,"Solid Entry, Not a Classic",7,22 October 2018,"Possibly the best sequel in the series, but nowhere close to the 1978 original classic. If you are expecting a sequel on par with The Godfather Part II, this is not it. With tempered expectations this movie is highly enjoyable.The Good-
1. Michael Myers and his Mask. The portrayal is excellent in this movie. The mask is the best since the original by a mile. (Remember those laughable masks in Halloween 4, 5, and H2O?) The artists took great care to ensure the mask resembled the original 1978 one and they succeeded. Best of all, Michael actually lurks around in backgrounds, appears in shadows, and reflections. This satisfying concept was largely abandoned in prior sequels.2. Jamie Lee Curtis gives an A+ performance. She plays an emotionally scarred survivalist (Laurie Strode) who lives in constant paranoia ever since 1978. Her house is secluded, booby-trapped, and she is armed to the teeth. Laurie has alienated her family while preparing for 40 years for Michael's return. JLC is strong in her role and steals every scene.3. John Carpenter's Score- Is Perfect. Gone are the awful late 80's electric guitar riffs of 4-5 and the Dawson's Creek melodic drama version in H20. We get back to basics here with organs and synthesizers.4. The Smith's Grove Sanitarium scene of the opening act. Arguably the best scene of the film. With the checker-board floor and Michael tethered to a pole, the British journalist taunts Michael with his mask. The way this scene plays out is nothing short of creepy, eerie, and superb.5. It has been said that this film is a ""MeToo"" movement version of Halloween. While the main heroes are women (3 generations of Strodes), the film shows restraint and does a good job of avoiding political controversies. There isn't a hint of politics here (Thank Heavens!).The Bad-
1. The story is lacking. The basic premise of Michael escaping after 40 years to have a final showdown with Laurie sounds simple. The opening and closing acts stay true to this concept. But once we get beyond this basic premise things unravel a bit. The writing is disjointed and lazy resulting in plotholes. Promising scenes are created but no follow through. The writers often take the easy route when a bolder direction could have lead to a great story arc. Much of the first 1/3 is exposition. Some flashback scenes to 1978's aftermath similar to the 1963 flashback in the original would have sufficed. The film's ending also left a lot to the imagination and opened the door to sequels.2. The decision to make Laurie Strode a random victim rather than Michael Myers' sister was a strategic mistake. The story was not bettered and it removed Michael's motive for killing. The writers could have left that part alone and achieved similar results. By making the killings random, it forced the writers to contrive events to reunite Laurie and Michael.3. Michael and Laurie are all that matter. The other characters are wasted. Too many supporting characters result in too little development. Judy Greer and her daughter add little substance to this movie. Much time is wasted on various subplots and dramas with these women that lead to nowhere. Will Patton's role as town sheriff begins promisingly but ultimately ends in disappointment due to the writers' questionable decisions. The ""New Loomis"" doctor, the black cowboy law enforcement guy, and the British Journalists were abominations.4. The directors do a rather poor job of establishing the mood. The original Halloween depicted the town of Haddenfield with spooky music blairing while we were immersed in the fall landscape. This movie bypasses that aspect. We jump straight to the night and Michael killing upon arrival.5. The killings were a bit rushed. In the 1978 version, Michael patiently and methodically stalked his victims in a voyeuristic manner before the final kill. This lead to tension and suspense building until a climax. While the 2018 version does some interesting concepts with Michael lurking in the shadows, the kills seem rushed. 2018 Michael has little inhuman patience like his 1978 version had. 2018 Michael gets straight to the point and uses brute force to dispatch victims. The gore level is more akin to Rob Zombie's remakes than Carpenter's original.6. The comedy was misplaced. There were a couple of LOL moments that were genuinely funny. The rest of the jokes mostly didn't hit. There was nervous laughter where you felt you had to laugh because everyone else was, not because the moment was actually funny. The abundance of jokes at times detracted from the horror of the film.Overall the positives outweighed the negatives. The 2018 version is well worth seeing. At best, it is the best Halloween sequel. At worst, it is tied with 1981's Halloween II, Halloween 4, or H20. It all depends on your perspective.",Halloween
848,kasparslabais,10/10? How? Average Horror movie viewer.,4,26 October 2018,"So...if you see rating 10/10 the you should ignore it right away. I'm just average Horror movie watcher so I judge this movie by itself not as franchise or how good sequel it is, but how good as horror movie in general it is.NO SPOILERS! (kinda)1. Not scary. At the end of the movie, I felt like...not even convinced I watched ""Horror"" movie, but more like dark crime drama.2. Too much movie mistakes/dum things. I will not go what exactly, but they were so obvious and so many (ofcourse cliche too) that I was more baffling how dum is this, how dum is that, than actually enjoying movie. I know horror movies is not too good with that, but from advertising it try to sell me that it is like rebirth which we all need/want so I expected some (just some) attention to details.3. Was it like PG 13? If not scary, than at least gruesome or something like that...but that missed from movie too.Bottom line is, I rated it so low, because It had fake hype and it not delivered anything what I would expect from horror movie at all, and if you are giving good rating just because it is better sequal than others, then sorry, I'm not fan of ""Halloween"" and rated it compering to other horror movies in general.",Halloween

852,jaymcguinness,A great ending to a great franchise,7,27 December 2018,"Halloween has always been a classic horror franchise. There's no doubt it has had dips in quality over the course of it's franchise but here it receives a fitting ending.I must stress that by 'ending', I am referring to the end of this film. The beginnings of this movie did not fill me with much hope. In fact I was really worried they were going to produce the worst film yet.
The plot moved far too quickly. One of the first scenes is meeting Michael, soon after we catch up on the entire backstory of Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) in a couple of sentences. I just felt the writing could have been so much better. Not to mention the early dialogue, especially from the two journalists...played by Jefferson Hall and Rhian Ress. It was awful.Fortunately, things improved. As ever the action scenes, if you can call them that, were very good. Jamie Lee Curtis pretty much is the blueprint in how to play the intense, scared yet fearless prey of the predator and the scenes with her and Michael in the house were some of the best scenes from not just this movie but the entire franchise.I also must mention an unknown gem in the movie. That is the child actor Jibrail Nantambu. This kid is going to be a star. He was funny, believable and an outstanding actor for such a young age. He had relatively short screen time as the kid with his babysitter but he was excellent.I thought they could have done a lot more with the plot here. So many interesting things could have been done with the Dr.Sartain character and slight twist. Despite that, I thought the ending was good and a fitting way to end the franchise. It scrapes a 7 based on the ending and the nostalgia that comes with all things Halloween and Michael Myers.",Halloween
853,colinrfricke,Awesome! A great twist on the slasher genre,9,20 September 2020,"This was a great movie. The movie is a sequel to the original 1978 Halloween movie. In the movie an aged Michael Myers escapes from the mental institution and wreaks havoc on Haddonfield on the same night as 40 years earlier. Meanwhile the story also follows an older and still traumatized Laurie Strode who lives in a bunker home and practiced with guns for the ray Michael escapes again. However her paranoia causes her to lose her daughter both literally as a child to Child Services and figuratively in a relationship. Laurie'a granddaughter is sympathetic and closer to Laurie than her mother. The movie ends with an epic showdown between Myers and Stode.The movie did not disappoint. It had some twists, plenty of action and the showdown between the two original rivals was nothing short of epic. The story hits on the trauma of victims of horrendous acts and the effects on their family in Laurie's family drama. Meanwhile there is a decent amount of social commentary that follows generational differences and the traumas that different generations go through. Serial killers were the thing in the 1970s when the original was made but not the same now. This leads one Gen Z character to comment ""it isn't a big deal compared to things today"" for what happened to Laurie. However he proves incorrect as when Myers shows up her wreaks havoc on a scale the kids have never seen before. Other issues such as the right to self defense, gun rights, and science morality are included. Highly recommended.",Halloween

856,ginnymason,"Disappointing, Suspense-Free Sequel",2,10 December 2018,"Maybe I went in with too much hype, but if everyone hadn't been building it up as a grand ""return to form"", maybe I wouldn't have been as disappointed. David Gordon Green's Halloween promised to go back to the roots of the series and disregard all the cheesy sequels that came after John Carpenter's original.They did get a few things right - they brought back John Carpenter to do the film's score and he does a splendid job. Michael looks better than he has in years with a mask that actually looks like the one from the original film and has a lankier frame than some of the more stocky stuntman types that have played the role in the sequels. Jamie Lee Curtis has also returned and she seems game for just about anything and her good will goes a long way, but not far enough.After perhaps the least interesting opening sequence of the entire franchise, Halloween picks up with Laurie Strode who's now pushing 60, living in seclusion, and obsessed with the return of Michael Myers. For her, it's not a question of if Michael will come back to Haddonfield, but a question of when. Two slightly annoying British podcasters have managed to find her and want her for an interview. We learn that Laurie's been married a few times, lost custody of her daughter, and seems to be on shaky ground with both daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter.Of course, Michael escapes during a hospital transfer and starts terrorizing Haddonfield again. Will Laurie be able to stop him? Will you even care since all the characters are as hollow as jack-o-lanterns?If this film was just another run of the mill sequel in the franchise, one could say it's certainly a few notches above Resurrection or The Curse of Michael Myers, but the pretensions of the filmmakers made it clear that this was going to be something different and something more in tone with the original. Unfortunately, it's not. Far from it. If you switched Michael's mask out with a hockey mask, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was one of the later, less interesting Friday the 13th sequel.While Michael has always been a soulless killing machine, he only killed if you were in the way or he needed something from you. This time, he goes out of his way to kill random people for no reason except to appease gorehounds.When he finally does get around to terrorizing our new main characters, there's no suspense, because they've been so poorly developed to the point where most of them might as well not even have names. The only character who stands out in any way is Vicky - Laurie's granddaughter's sassy BFF and babysitter. Perhaps this is a testament to the skills of actress Virginia Gardner who's able to make this cardboard cutout even remotely endearing. If you don't mind, I'd rather imagine a film with her as lead ""Final Girl.""To make matters worse, there's an incredibly lousy twist that seems to only exist as a lazy excuse to get Michael to Laurie's booby trapped house for the big showdown.Despite a great music score, nice look for Myers, and the return of Curtis, this new Halloween has very little to keep one interested and it's definitely this year's Emperor's New Clothes of horror films.",Halloween

It's been like 20 years since a good Halloween has come out and it's here! I get that some people will find H18 overrated/over hyped and might not like the fact that it changes the timeline which cancels out every Halloween movie since the original and I respect that because it's pretty bold to do that to a franchise that's 40+ years old but to sit there and suggest that it's the worst in the series and ""that it's an abomination to the franchise""...not buying it. People tend to automatically hate a movie that critic's like. I'm a big fan of the Halloween franchise but I think there's some sequels that are better than others (H2, H20, H18) some that are good (H4, H6) guilty pleasures, and Resurrection. Not even mentioning Zombie's completely unnecessary remake.First thing's first, it's not perfect. The whole ""discount Loomis"" thing was unnecessary. The scene at the dance where the bf was being a d*** didn't go anywhere at all and totally unneeded. They could've at least killed him off. Other than that, H18 was a good Halloween movie. Great callbacks to the other films. Having Jamie Lee Curtis back is always a big plus in my book along with Nick Castle (original Micheal) making a cameo. The guy playing Micheal Myers killed it, no pun intended. Best mask since the original! The sound design and the music/score was amazing. I liked the funny dialogue because it was casual and seemed like an everyday conversation you'd have with friends, family, etc. The kills were great with having some that were gory and some done off-screen but the make-up effects were done really well.Obviously nothing is gonna touch Carpenter's 1978 classic Halloween, but it was a well done sequel and I feel that the movie deserves it's praise.

866,shawnpilgrim,"Really good, except for one major flaw.",10,21 October 2018,"In the first Halloween, we are led to believe Michael Myers is almost supernatural. He is seen several times by Laurie, yet suddenly disappears. He's able to break through wooden doors with his fist, able to lift people up with one arm. Then at the end, escapes after being shot off the 2nd floor.In this one, none of that occurs. He appears as just a psychotic murderer in a mask. He doesn't really jump out too much. He is seen by people and even followed. This movie seemed more like it could really happen. Which I think makes it better and ultimately scarier.The one flaw: If this movie ignores all sequels, and in the first he disappears at the end, How is he captured? They do not mention how they found him and captured him without being murdered. I would have loved an explanation.",Halloween

876,millmat,"See it for Curtis, the climax, and Carpenter's score.",7,16 November 2018,"Halloween (the 2018 film, continuing a strange trend since Ghostbusters (2016) of reboots to franchises just having the exact same name as their older counterparts) is a mix of genuine scariness, great acting(Curtis especially is captivating, even though I had little doubt about that), rebooting a series respectfully with little franchise-maintenance, respectable direction by David Gordon Green that's faithful to the original (even though there are some moments were a different choice would've been more effective), and some writing that never goes beyond well-intention-ed ideas.The reason it doesn't get past ""good enough"" is because it feels like a film made by genuine fans of the original who want to have it both ways, i.e. do things we've never seen in the franchise that seem like natural directions the series should have gone in, but also keep things from getting too far out there so that the hardcore fans won't feel like they've broken too many supposed rules. This became clear to me in a character twist at the end of the second act that not only gives the series welcomed connections to the horrifying but continually fascinating psyches of serial killers, but hints that it's building towards a new exploration at what's driving Michael Myers, and who he is. But because it would have lead to moments that would probably be loved by casual moviegoers but hotly contested by really hardcore fans of the series, it's only ever explored in the aforementioned twist scene.Also a bit too much padding in the second act with too many killing teenager sequences. They're well-directed, but they over-stayed their welcome too much for my liking. One or two do their job reminding us how much we liked them in the original, but eventually you're wishing it'd get back to the story of the film.Having said that, yeah, Jamie Lee Curtis really is great. In reboot sequels these days, there's been a lot of ""take the hero or heroine of the series and turn them into a loon"" in reboot/sequels to mixed success, but it really works with Laurie Strode. Seeing the babysitter next door turn into a slightly crazed gun magnate is the most interesting drama in the film. There's also a great bit in the climax paying homage to a famous scene in the original, and the reason it works is because it actually does twist it around.See it for Curtis, the direction, and John Carpenter's new score. Being just ""good-enough"" should not be taken to mean it's bad.But nothing can top the original.",Halloween

But overall the movie follows a really poor script.There are a lot of nonsensical scenes, involving characters appearing in some places just because, and saying or doing things that feel completely misplaced (moving Michael to another institution just before Halloween? What a coincidence! A character saying that he got peanut butter on his penis, really? And later there is more peanut butter, but this time on a bánh mì).Some scenes are intense and have that classic, slow suspense tone to them. The death scenes are quite good too, if you discount some stupid things that characters did to be on Michaels way. Gory without being too gratuitous. But the movie is not written for those who appreciate a convincing story with plausible characters.Definitely not the best sequel. That's Halloween II (1981).",Halloween

Michael and Laurie feel equal in this movie, one doesn't overpower the other. You have no idea who's going to win this very anticipated fight and it's one of my favorite things about the movie.

How wrong was I! Let me start off by saying that the starting was promising. Michael in a mental instatution, still a monster, you kinda felt this was gonna be great. But it all started to collapse after that. The plot was absolutely messed up, I mean it was going in hundreds of directions and sometimes I was left thinking, ""what was the point of that?"". The acting of some of the characters was laughable. I mean Laurie's daughter was in basement wishing her mum good luck, whilst Laurie went off to fight Michael on her own was just plain WTF!!! The little kid that was being babysitted for casually ran out of the house whilst Michael was stabbing his babysitter. Again WTF???Overall, the storyline seemed muddled and bad and the film was longer than it needed to be. I feel sad that something that could have been so great was made into a massive joke.I gave this film 3 stars because i love Jamie Lee Curtis, only the starting was decent, and Michael looked the part (despite the rubbish storyline).I'd avoid paying for this film and wait for it to come out on TV.",Halloween
884,brandonmau,Personally I think it's the best Halloween movie,6,5 March 2020,"I find the original Halloween overrated, I hated Rob Zombie's remake, and I haven't seen any of the previous sequels. So that automatically makes this the best movie in the series. For me Halloween 2018 did so many things better than the original. The acting is much better, I found the characters more tolerable, and this movie is just far creepier.However this sequel does still suffer from a few things of the same things as the original plus some new things. Besides Jamie Lee Curtis pretty much all of the characters aren't interesting, there are some characters who seem important at first but then just disappear without a resolution and the film has a bit of a tonal problem. There is also an issue I have that is more a nitpick I don't understand why it's called just Halloween. This is supposed to be a sequel but it has same title as the original. That makes things confusing. Overall it's an enjoyable movie. I just wish they weren't making a sequel and the series would just stop because this is a great place to end it! 6/10",Halloween
885,ThatGuyReviews,"I'm Not Scared, Just Disappointed",5,14 October 2019,"The horror film that I was most anticipating this year is the one that left me the most disappointed.
I really don't know what to say about this. It was not by any means a truly bad film like Venom, which was shown alongside this when I went to see them, but neither did it match up to any of the other good horror films released this year. Given the rave reviews from TIFF, I had expected this incarnation of the Shatner masked killer to at least compare to the original, but instead I am simply left with a bad taste in my mouth. Despite an incredible score by the always great Carpenter, a terrific opening credits sequence, attention to detail from the prop and costume departments, and competent cinematography, the film falls apart at its seams. The acting is stale and honestly boring, even with Jamie Lee Curtis putting at least some effort into her character. The direction by David Gordon Green wasn't anything spectacular, with some interesting scenes, such as an extended tracking shot while Myers enters the neighborhood, interspersed among a slog of very typical and uninteresting reverses, medium close-ups, and janky edits. All of this would still add up to a decent enough flick if it wasn't for the failures of the story and plot, however. There's nothing to love about this generic and honestly boring horror-by-the-numbers. It never needed to be something particularly grandiose, but one would think that the filmmakers would attempt something different when releasing the third film in the series that is just called Halloween (enter year here). An obvious and comically written ""surprise"" antagonist drags this movie down into the pits of horror movie cliche, completely predictable deaths and THREE last girls included. While some sequences in this film do inspire real suspense due to the sound design (such as one in particular with a baby's cry), there are many more frustrating moments where the mixing falls apart and a badly timed scare chord will completely draw the viewer out of the experience. At the end of the day, Halloween (2018) is not offensively bad, nor even really one of the worst movies in the series, but it still offers little to nothing of any actual substance.Halloween (2018) Letter Grade: C-",Halloween

888,liberalareblowhacks,And the point of this was what again?,4,3 March 2019,"Halloween H20 was the perfect ending to the franchise, having Laurie Strode eradicate years of trauma and turmoil by clearly decapitating Michael Myers. Yeah, yeah, I know it was supposed to actually have been someone else, but the director had Michael in mind at the time it was shot, and for good reason: it ENDED there.Then we had the farce known as Resurrection that was dumped in our laps. Idiotic teenagers, webcams, cheap pick-up lines, and a terribly embarrassing Busta Rhymes is all that disaster consisted of. What could go wrong, right?Then there's this film, which seems to be the equivalent of what Rocky 6 was for Stallone. Why did Jamie Lee feel it was necessary to return yet again, with yet another version of Laurie, to continue to pimp out the Strode/Myers storyline? This is a movie filled with bland characters, awkward dialogue (some of which was pointlessly humorous and had no place in a horror film), and a final act that we all saw coming about 15 minutes into the movie. I may be in the minority here, but I very much liked the Laurie Strode in H20. The woman was hip, quick-witted and had a raunchy side to her, filled with booze and banging the college counselor. Yet she still had a good head on her shoulders and fought the battles that were necessary. She faced her ultimate fear in the end and won. This movie sort of goes for the same vibe, but falls short, possibly because it was already done before (hint hint, H20). Nothing new or thrilling was added to the franchise with this movie. I realize that Hollywood is driven by money and consumed with it, but I would hope some of these entertainers still have some pride in their work, particularly with characters they've shaped over the years. I personally feel that this was not the right way for Laurie to go out, but then again who cares what I think, right? And if history has taught us anything, Laurie Strode will be back in about four or five years, this time battling Michael in space or in Hawaii somewhere. Hey, maybe even Busta Rhymes can return for a special appearance and rap his way through the opening titles. The franchise has already been destroyed, so what the hell would that matter?Some things are just better left alone. Halloween 2018 was entirely unnecessary and did nothing new for closure to the franchise. If you are going to subject yourself to this garbage, why not make it a little fun at least? Head off to the store, grab yourself a bottle of Evan Williams, and take a shot every time Laurie's granddaughter or son-in-law say or do something to annoy you. You should pass out at some point right around the middle of the film and, with any luck, the television in your emergency room will be showing something better. Enjoy!",Halloween

895,Number1Animeguy,You can't have cake and eat it to,4,3 February 2019,"There are too many side characters so very little defines any one of them so none of them stand out but for the comic dialogue that goes from sometimes funny to most of the time dumb and out of place. The black kid and the babysitter have the best dialogue between them but they're barely in the movie so you don't care.The comedy is so bad at points it makes you hate the characters. I wouldn't mind the comedy if it made the characters likable but they have no character so even if you do like the comedy you can't like the characters.The comedy just makes the tone inconsistent and stops the building of suspense, tension, and atmosphere by shifting the tone over and over again. Also, I just couldn't care about any of the characters, and some of them I just wanted them to die. Which is not how you write good characters.Laurie Strode has become crazy Laurie from Halloween resurrection, even trying to entrap him as she did in that film but using her own home unlike that film and that Laurie had many long encounters. She is defined by paranoia and almost nothing else. It has mostly become her whole character. Her paranoia can't be justified base on the fact that Michael Myers has very little connection to her as none of the other movies happened. A 10-15 min random encounter very unlikely turns her into a paranoid survivalist, how plot convenience.Laurie and maybe her daughter are the only characters you can care about and their scenes are the only parts that have suspense but only because you liked Laurie in the other films. The execution is bad as I found both unlikable and it has been done better. The guns she has are not the best choices ever making her look like a moron, buy an AR-15, or even a sword would be better. Martial arts, gun, and survivalist training won't get your kids taken away unless you go full-on torture training, making her horrible or the writers. Halloween 2018 would be better if it was a sequel to Halloween 2 as she would have far more justification but they already did that. Seems to me they're running out of ideas.The film is almost saying that she was in the right to think this way as for some reason almost everything she did to help ruin her connection to her family in the past helped them out in the end. Meaning all the guns/survivalist training ended up being useful, the gun and survivalist training is what got her kid taken away. Also, the whole point of the first film is to tell you those upper-middle-class suburbs are not safe so the characters being normal people made them relatable to those viewers and is what made it so unnerving and scary at the time. Can you relate to her now, do even most victims of violence become paranoid survivalists? I don't think so.Michael doesn't know where she lives and so has to be taken to her and when she went after him he just took off because he doesn't care about her. The whole fan idea that he's going after her because she got away destroys the whole point of this movie which is to remove any of his so-called motivations from the other films.He just kills random people just like he supposedly does in the first film so she doesn't even have to do anything.In the first film.Michael Myer's older sister was 17 teen years old and all the other girls in the film are that age.He takes his older sister's tombstone and puts one of the girls under it and what I meant when I say under it is that it stands above her not that it's on top of her, very symbolic.He picks the same night of the year he killed his older sister.Michael Myers stalks the girls the whole movie, he doesn't randomly kill people.He picks the girl that has a little boy with her and does nothing to him, the boy is maybe a symbolic representation of himself in his mind.Michael Myers lacks deeper motivation, he's not random he just likes killing certain people for the sake of it.Also, you don't need the sister subplot from two as Michael Myers hears the girl he was stalking the whole first film was at the hospital by the means of a boombox.Also,John carpenter hates Halloween 2 because he was forced to write it.There are too many plot conveniences as the story is built on the back of them mostly for superficial reasons like his masks. It should be long gone by now as these types of masks tend to rot quickly and for the fact, he just so happens to just run into the people who have it and how they got it, to begin with, was very easy. Just pay off the District Attorney I believe.The story should have moved along slowly building suspense, tension, and characterization but the extremely fast pacing stops that from happening. There's very little to no build-up and he also just kills too many random people and even when there is build-up beforehand this movie has mostly one-note characters.Without the sister subplot from two, they have to force them together by having a very dumb twist ( the doctor is evil) as it was done just for the sake of instigating the plot moving forward and nothing else.He's also way more superhuman than he was in Halloween 2 and the people that were hyping this film up as a return to these films being more grounded and realistic were full of it. It's as realistic as Halloween 4 when it's not stealing plot and scenes from Halloween 4 and the other films. Most of Its best scenes are rip-offs, it takes from Halloween 2, Halloween 4, H20, and Robs Halloween.Also, the Podcasters were a dumb idea. If his doctor wasn't evil then they'd never let them do that or who knows with this clown world we live in as he's a mentality ill psychopath or for the fact he won't say anything, how boring. Who would watch that? Even worse because of the obvious foreshadowing. But without the twist( the doctor is evil) it would be a plot hole. He has gotten out before and this was near Halloween the day he kills people.Why is the superhuman killer man outside his room to begin with? The hospital would more than likely get into a lawsuit over such a thing if it made him go on a killing spree or mentally distressed all the other patients., which it did.Too many cooks in the kitchen killed this film. The film wants Michael Myers to be random but also wants him to go after Laurie Strode. The film wants him to be old and run down but also wants to make him superhuman. They want him to be more human as they show his face so much at the start but also not. The ending is open and taken from Halloween 2 and resurrection as this film has no good ideas that it didn't steal.THE KILLS ARE VERY WEAK but for a few.",Halloween

897,juniorc-47421,Nothing New Here,4,14 December 2019,"Let's see if we can keep this straight. This movie is called Halloween. The franchise's first film in 1978 is called Halloween. Rob Zombie's 2007 remake is called Halloween. The 2018 film called Halloween is supposed to be a direct sequel to the 1978 film called Halloween. I'm guessing they didn't dare call it Halloween 2 because we already have two of those. We have a Halloween 2 filmed in 1981 and a Halloween 2 filmed in 2009. So they gave it the same name as the movie it's supposed to be a sequel to, which is even more ridiculous than having another Halloween 2. There's about six other Halloween movies in between all of that, with some that are numbered and some that aren't with various timelines and one that has nothing do with Michael Myers. If you're new to the Franchise, I wish you luck trying to make any sense out of this gobbledygook. This franchise needs to die. There's nowhere else to go with it. This third movie called Halloween contains nothing we haven't seen before. As a stand alone slasher movie it does the job, and if this the first Halloween movie you've seen you'll no doubt enjoy it. But if you've seen the other 10, this is only going to bore you to death. Like a lot of the other movies in the Halloween franchise, it is brutal and fast-paced, which works in its favour. This one though seems to have more worthless characters than most of the others. Two of the three main heroines didn't need to be there and I ain't talking about Jamie Lee Curtis, who was very good as she always is. The best movies in the franchise are when it's just her against Michael, one on one. Everyone else in this movie is just clutter.",Halloween

I also enjoyed the in depth character examination the movie puts on Michael, it makes you think they might reveal the motive behind his badness, but when it comes to pure evil, you'll find yourself searching for the rest of your life. As for the ending, it certainly leaves you wanting more. Why not 10 stars?? Here comes the spoiler.... they should have revealed to the audience that Karen's maiden name is Tramer.",Halloween
899,syed-16295,A decent reboot and the best of the Halloween sequels,8,27 January 2020,"I thought this movie was a good, fresh start for the Halloween series. There have been a myriad of sequels that range from mediocre to outright trash. I'm glad they started from scratch. I like the direction they took for Laurie's character. Like Sarah Connor from Terminator 1 & 2, Laurie has developed from a helpless victim to certified bad*ss. Unlike Rob Zombie's Halloween films, the secondary characters aren't unlikable *ssholes that make you root for Michael. Michael is truly an imposing and ruthless villain in this film. His mask is probably the best since the original Shatner mask from '78. They nailed the score for this movie. It has some of the best music of the series. 'The Shape Stalks Allyson' was just amazing. That sound they made from running a violin bow across a guitar was unique and brilliant. The film is not without its flaws. As usual, some characters make stupid decisions like in many horror movies. There is a twist that I wasn't too fond of, though it gets somewhat redeemed by an awesome kill. Maybe the film could have cut down on the comedy a shade. Overall the pros outweigh the cons. I am looking forward to what they do next in the sequel.",Halloween
900,sofiasousa85,Good but not excelent,6,25 October 2018,"While its great that we finally had a sequel , it is bad that Laurie and Michael interaction was a lame 10mnts... Halloween is made of both of them and the good thing about the previous movies was that all the other deaths were just an warm up for their face to face and cat mouse chase.. thats what made Michael so scary ... you can run all you want but he will still catch you... there was none of that in this movie and despitw being a good one it leaves you wanting more",Halloween
901,mstvincent,My Review for Common Sense Media,6,28 November 2018,"This film is from the director of the director of the beloved comedy film ""Pineapple Express"", the critically divisive comedy ""Your Highness"", the excellent drama film ""Stronger"" as well as the extremely underrated Nicolas Cage film ""Joe"". I was a bit skeptical knowing this director's history being w/ comedy and drama but was very impressed after I had seen it. Part of my love is also in thanks to horror powerhouse producers Blumhouse and screenwriter Danny McBride.The first half of the film is by far the best w/ beautiful (albeit not OSCAR worthy) cinematography and superb musical score. An unmasked Michael Myers was really creepy and looked really terrifying. I ended up wanting more of unmasked Michael after he had put his mask on. Michael is so much more unhinged and violenct than he has been in any other film (w/ the exception of the Rob Zombie films). The kills in this film have variety but do include Michael's signature stabbing and strangling. There are so many standout scenes in this film such as Michael Myer's getting transported to the next facility, the discovery of the crashed transport bus (very damn creepy scene), ect. Jamie Lee Curtis does so well in this film as she had done w/ the previous films of the franchise that she had appeared in. Judy Greer; who I love in so many other films, was just so average and annoying here then does a complete character 360° at the end of the film which felt so forced as wel as out of place. Andi Matichak as Allyson (Laurie Strode's granddaughter) felt like every other generic teen character in slasher films. She offered nothing special and didn't have the same charm or likeability as Jamie Lee Curtis did in the original. Both Jefferson Hall and Rhian Rees are two of the more interesting characters. They portray two journalists writing a story of the slayings that had occurred back in 1978. They're both excellent in their roles and are more than two-dimensional Michael bait. Haluk Bilginer as the new Dr Loomis; Dr Sartain, also does fantastic in the movie even up to that forced twist but even w/ that twist he plays it off incredibly. Lastly, Will Patton is really good as Officer Hawkins and does well w/ all the screen time he is given.The violence in this film is bordering on being as gory as Rob Zombie's 2007 remake. A man has his head banged against a door till it kills him leaving him bloodied on the ground, a woman is beaten to death w/ a hammer, a kid is strangled, a man is shot, a teen gets impaled on a fence, a man gets his head destroyed after Michael stomps on it (extremely graphic), ect. This is more violent than all the original films put together.Typical swearing w/ 23 f-words as well as multiple uses of the s-word, b-word and other minor expletives. A few of the f-words are said by a ten year old kid.While there is no sex scenes there is a large amount of sexual dialogue which is to be expected from a write such as Danny McBride.The film all up is a very good sequel to the 1978 classic and the sequel we deserved from the beginning but it's better late than never. I would give this film a 7.4/10 and do think the first half of the film is so much better than the generic slasher second half of the film.This film however is definitely not for kids due to graphic and bloody violence that it contains. I'd recommend this to 17yo at the very least and think no parent should take anyone younger to see it.",Halloween

905,LasPlagas96,"Pretty average, flat story",6,30 October 2018,"The movie did not really take my breath. The movie begins with a couple of journalists visit Michael Myers in the Asylum for a report, which was a very good opening in my opinion. The scene where the journalists await a reaction from Michael while showing him his mask was great.
Actually, all in all I liked the performances of the actors very much, filming was also great. It created a nice creepy atmosphere where is fitted. Some fake jump scares should have been kept out.
I also liked that I saw some parallels to Terminator 2's character Sarah Conner. Laurie Strode was known as a shy scaredy teen in the first movie and now she feels like a badass warrior with combat and gun experience, like Sarah Connor. The hunter becomes the hunted, it references the scene from the first movie where Michael fell out of the window to the ground and then disappears got inversed with Laurie falling.
Michael instead seems not focused on Laurie only as in the first movie but stalks and kills random people and doesn't even seem to go for Laurie. Here its her who chases Michael.
About the violence and kills, its way less bloody and dark as in its predecessor from Rob Zombie.
If you see the movie's storyline after, it seems like a very flat and idea-lacking plot. To be part 11 in the franchise, there is nothing new to add. The story is also very easy to predict, like everyone knews in the movie opening that Michaels transfer to another facility will fail and he escapes.
In addition I also didn't really understand the doctors character. He wanted to somehow capture Michael alive and goes so far and kills a cop to protect Michael, but then dies shortly after by the man he wanted to keep alive.To conclude, Halloween (2018) was not outstanding in my opinion and was slightly better than H20 (hard to compare with Rob Zombies remakes). The storyline disappointed me a bit, but Laurie's character transformation and her hunting down Michael and later killing him like a boss was well done",Halloween

But there are so many logical and artistic flaws in this one, I could only endure this movie for Halloween's sake itself. Bad dialogue (literally, dialogue does not make sense, does not build up to anything or reveal characters), full of plot wholes, meaningless kills (even a slasher can attribute some meaning to its kills), and ridiculous ending. I usually say that I watch it for fun so I can ignore the minor flaws but in this one, nope. I mean, if you are a good with detail, you can even realize where they probably cut out a relevant scene because they just cut to the next one almost irreleventally.I wonder how the resources that enabled the producers to get this good cast and production were spent so unwisely to destroy a whole slasher experience.",Halloween

It feels like another run-of-the-mill slasher movie made by some low budget production company to see if they can earn out a quick buck.Now that I've said all that, let me finish the final scene of this movie (only because I'm extremely bored with nothing else to do).",Halloween
909,jonathanbrown12,Worth all the wait.,8,22 October 2018,"""I have been preparing for this for a long time."" This is what comes to mind when This movie was released.Being a fan of the original Halloween, I was excited at the news of a new Halloween movie. Then the news that Jamie Lee Curtis was in it made me even more excited. And then to hear that it was an sequal to the original sent me over the moon.I am a very big fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and thought she did an outstanding job in this role. Her paranoid mindset throughout the movie was well played out, allowing you to feel for her; it seemed to show the true affects of a traumatic situation in someone's life. Having to live everyday knowing the person that killed your friends is still alive and waiting for the day to kill you too will make anyone crazy.
The erosion of her social life and family ( ruined marriages and distant family members) makes you see that she is human, just trying to survive in a chaotic and ruthless world.Then there's Michael Myers. The beginning scene at the Mental hospital was promising, as it showed just how aware and direct Michael was. Though there never seemed to be a pattern to his killings, he seemed methodical in his ways of finishing off each victim. The way he seemed to track down his mask (as if it was the ""one ring"" calling for its master) shows how alert he was to the situation and how careful and planning he seemed to be.The movie in a whole was very well made. It gave homage to the original and did not deter from the horror so epic depicted 40 years ago.I have no complaints for this film and will recommend this movie to anyone that wants a good scare and a great finish to a great saga. Do not come in with anything from the franchise (other than the original) in mind. If you hadn't seen the original, watch it before you see this one. It will make more sense.Hope this helps greatly.",Halloween

911,judgejimp,Hmm. Wasted Opportunity!,6,27 October 2018,"I was born in 78 the same year the original was released and am a huge fan of that film as well as H20. Unfortunately i felt this one missed the mark somewhat. It wasn't horrible but not a classic either. Right form the start it was nice to see the original style Halloween opening credits and classic Carpenter synths which immediately put a smile on my face. The score also gets an update in this film which i felt was taking inspiration from films like 'IT Follows' which sound great but here lies the problem. Halloween being such an ICONIC movie i feel it needs to be true to itself and the original and maybe trying to appeal to a younger audience not only in score but in curtain pointless scenes as well as bringing in ill fitting humour maybe to temper the rather sombre feel to the film which is not in keeping with the original or H20 even given that this is classed as a horror movie. The feel and meter of the film just didn't sit right with me. Carpenter films are all about atmosphere and i think turning Lorrie into this reclusive bedraggled mad cat woman didn't work for me especially considering the characters suave in H20 all be it still a troubled personality she still had that Jamie Lee sexiness and je ne se quoi. I didn't love the casting either and the best thing to happen to those ridiculously stereotypical English characters was in a bit of a homage to H20 in the wash room scene.
There were good things they did in this movie but all in all it just didn't work together, felt mismatched and didn't get the atmosphere right for me i'm afraid.
Maybe i personally was just looking for a re-run of the original and H20 and less Rob Zombie style sombreness.",Halloween

Some of the kills were often the victims fault, which typical in slasher films. But the family conflict and each of the major characters had a bit of depth and development, which is not something you expect from a slasher film.
The final confrontation with Laurie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I felt tense while watching it, not scared in a horrified way but more so watching wide-eyed wondering what would happen next.

915,itsnotpersonal-55577,"Confusion Abounds, but still a Euphoric Cinematic Experience",7,4 November 2018,"I've waited years for this film. YEARS. Halloween is one of my favorite movies of all time and my favorite horror movie by a long shot. When I heard Carpenter was going to help with this project I was filled with joy and couldn't wait to see the redemption from Zombie's takes. While this is an amazing movie in a lot of ways, I was let down in some ways. I was expecting perfection like the first, especially with Carpenter being included.Negatives:
1. The male podcaster was annoying. I'm glad he died. His badgering of Laurie, borderline verbally attacking, while seemingly uplifting Michael was... Unnecessary.
2. The cop with the cowboy hat makes NO sense. Everytime he showed up on screen it was distracting. I'm born and raised in IL. Grew up in the burbs, but had family in southern IL. The are no cops with cowboy hats. Anywhere. This is the Midwest. Not the wild wild west or Texas. Nothing against those places, but the cowboy hat didn't make sense for IL. Maybe if they gave him a storyline where he was a cop in TX or WY, then it'd be more believable, but everytime he popped up on screen all I could think of was ""did they look at a map? Have they ever stepped foot in this state or region?"" I mean I've even lived in Iowa and Ohio. No cowboy hats.
3. The. Doctor. Where do I start? One of the most nostalgic parts of Halloween is Dr. Loomis. He hated Michael, wanted him dead, saw him for what he was, and wasn't stupid. This doctor doesn't want him dead, tells people not to kill him, which I get to an extent. As someone obsessed with true crime I get wanting to study serial killers, but when they're actively out killing people I'd be just fine killing them to stop them. And then he ends up murdering the cop. (Will Patton). He admires Michael, wants to be him. He even puts on the mask. Psychiatrists have to go through extensive testing to do what they do and even more so those who study and are in contact with serial killers. This guy would fail miserably in 5 minutes. COME ON. I'm just at a loss of why this was added and why they thought it'd be good? Did they want the complete opposite of Loomis? Did they think it'd make it interesting? It didn't. It is the the biggest flaw to the movie, almost ruining it in my opinion. It's insulting quite frankly to the first. Did they think they needed more drama? We don't need drama. We have enough suspense and horror just waiting for Michael's next move and watching him kill. Adding this weird doctor storyline just diverted from the actual good stuff and muddled the waters for no good reason. If they could take out this bit, it would literally be a perfect movie.
4. When Michael kills the doctor he is sitting right next to Laurie Strode's granddaughter. They're both stuck in the backseat of a police car. She cannot escape. The whole movie he is indiscriminately killing everyone for fun, for no reason at all, for being a family member, but somehow he doesn't kill her when he has MINUTES in an ENCLOSED space to do so?!?!? I am.... speechless, confused.. why. WHY?! They could have given SOME explanation to make it believable.
5. The classic stalking scenes were missed. They could have given one. ONE.Positives:
1. I'm glad to see some more kills. Serial killers usually need to kill more and in more extreme manners in order to quench their cravings the older they get and the longer they kill, so it makes sense. Children were not even left untouched, which made it more realistic.
2. They kept true to Michael's demeanor. He had no motive or reason. He's calm and calculated. He simply wants to kill and see people suffer and die.
3. The music was perfect and at the right times.
4. The kills were fantastic.
5. I enjoyed that during two parts they made Michael just a bit more aggressive. It added to the growth of his character, but they didn't over do it. It was just enough to make it believable.
6. The cast was perfect, the acting was flawless and the storyline with Laurie and hey family were strong.
7. The nods to the first were well done and appreciated.
8. The trap was epic. EPIC.",Halloween
916,brettleeclark,Michael Myers is The Golden State Killer!,10,30 October 2018,"For anyone saying that Laurie wouldn't be as messed up as she is from just experiencing the horrors of part one... Let's take a real life murderer that was on the loose for 40+ years. In 1974, the Golden State Killer began his terror with raping women, then started raping women with their husband tied up, then started murdering people. In total The Golden State Killer raped over 50 women and murdered 13 people. The victims who were ""only"" raped dealt with trauma, fear, and ptsd. Couples divorced over it, and women looked over their shoulders for 40yrs, having guard dogs, guns, and alarm systems- all from just being raped. NOT TO DOWN PLAY RAPE, It's obviously a serious and very scary thing that happened in REAL LIFE, the Golden State Killer was caught in 2018- still able to walk and move around, even kill again if he pleased (like Michael). His victims were still living in fear. Point being time doesn't always heal scars- they are victims like Laurie, her character found 3 dead friends, got attacked, stabbed the attacker in the neck and eye, then watched him get shot multiple times and fall off a balcony and still survive. So her being extremely prepared, even if it was just one night of horror 40 years ago- is definitely believable. I wish they would of mentioned the Golden State Killer in interviews about dealing with fear for 40 yrs. The timeline is almost the same.
Ok- sooo beside that... Let's get to the point, Is the movie good? - yes Fun to Watch? - yes Scary? - yes... if you're a fan of all the sequels will I still like this one? -yes AND that's because a lot of the murders are mimicked after the sequels. From getting murdered in the same locations or in the same costume as a character from a previous movie. The old lady and neighbor is from part 2, the masks from part 3 are seen, there is an exact replica of the gas station from part 4, Tina's costume from part 5 is worn by the chubby friend, part 6 MAYBE when Laurie sees him in the window, part 7 (H20) the bathroom stall scene, part 8 im not sure because that one is horrible and I've only watched like once. lol .... without giving too much away part 5 & 6 are kinda the same as the twist in this movie. It's like all movies in one. I liked it. Ok- I'm rambling... The End.",Halloween
917,benembry-66286,"Stick to acting, Danny McBride",4,9 November 2018,"The movie's concept of being a direct sequel to the original is a great marketing idea but ultimately the movie they delivered was fairly flat. We spend too much time with under written characters that we're not given good reasons to care about.The story goes that Michael was arrested by young officer Hawkins in '78 (by himself? I guess?) and he's just been biding his time at Smith Grove for 40 years? C'mon dog be serious. Hey quick aside: I wonder how his trial went? Did the jury deliberate long? Did his attorneys put him in some beige sweaters to make him look less menacing? Guessing he got life since they don't seem to be too interested in executing a mass murderer.And I guess when you put the Dr. Sartain puzzle pieces together we're supposed to believe he causes the wreck that helps Michael escape. Damn Michael was pretty lucky to have the world's most derelict psychiatric doctor! Not only that but the podcasters who have his mask, (because the state let's random people take evidence from a 40 year old mass murder case?), just happen to be at the same gas station he stops at.Let's talk about how the night goes for Laurie and family because this is so dumb. Upon learning that THE Michael Myers is doing his thing in Hadonfield again, Karen and Ray are content to leave town with Laurie despite the fact their daughter is missing. I'll say that again: THEIR DAUGHTER IS MISSING! They just put old officer Hawkins on the case and go chill at Fort Laurie until he brings their daughter to them. HUH? And at what point does Karen *EVER* express concern that Ray has very quickly gone M.I.A.?This makes me appreciate H20 that much more. That was a satisfying reboot because it didn't try to do too much. Michael's back. Where has he been? Who cares. Laurie is in California and has a son and a drinking problem but she's not a nutcase doomsday prepper. It moved fast and let Michael do Michael things. That's all the new reboot needed to do but the writers simply failed.",Halloween
918,simest,No treat here I'm afraid.,2,10 May 2020,"So we have John Carpenter back on board, scoring and producing. We have Curtis back as Laurie Strode. We even have Nick Castle back, appearing as Myers!
So what could go wrong.........?Well, quite a lot as it happens.For all the positive noise made in the run up to it's release and the makers smug claims that this was to be the REAL sequel - jettisoning all the others out of existence in the story arc, I was largely disappointed.There was so little suspense and the whole thing quickly went straight down the well-trodden road of Myers versus Laurie (again) as though she was somehow his chief focus despite killing indiscriminately prior to this - seemingly without even the most vague pathology.Somewhere amongst all this, his pattern of re-enacting his sister Judith's murder (strongly implied in the original - to which this claims to directly connect and therefore also must focus on with renewed attention) seems completely forgotten. The whole concept of Myers reliving this event by seeking out, then strategically stalking surrogate victims that somehow resemble her, are replaced with a scattershot series of random, opportunist kills in the run up to a Super-bowl-type showdown with Laurie that we are predictably building towards even before he escapes.For me, this means the much hyped dismissal of the sister/brother angle from the earlier sequels was a waste of time because for all that, it still seemed all about Myers coming after Laurie.........only this time for reasons unknown. They might as well have left the sibling angle in because they completely overlooked the original concept of him killing Judith over and over by targeting teenage girls of her type. This was the only insight we had into the character from the original story but it was enough to make him terrifying yet keep him unfathomable. If they had stuck to this and had Laurie make it her mission to step in to try and thwart him (a la Loomis in the original) rather than be his star focus, that would have been consistent with the earlier Myers characterization and also a believable and intriguing extension of Laurie Strode.As it is, Strode and her kin are again painted as the passion of Myers' bloodlust - something we've seen several times over before. Laurie's ridiculous doomsday pad had me gasping in disbelief that the story had so centred on her again being the final stopping point of Myers' journey. Why she feels she would be in his firing line is vague and we as an audience are just trusted to accept this because it's the role and character Curtis will always be remembered for. But there is no reason Myers' would be hung up on settling a score with her, nor that she would be so obsessed with him. After all, she had only encountered him once in this new timeline and 40 years earlier at that.Judith Myers gets merely an obligatory mention from the villainous and utterly pointless Dr character, who is synthetically injected into the plot to provide an absurd and disastrous twist by himself turning homicidal - presumably out of obsession with Myers - only to end up the next victim himself mere moments later! Though this serves as a clunky solution to the logistics of transporting Myers to Laurie's fortress for that horribly telegraphed finale, it hardly seemed worth including the character and ultimately, the twist stank the whole movie to high heaven. I also thought it was daft to present us with a character that has presumably spent years in his specialised profession........ only to wait around for Myers' escape (an event that might never have occurred) and then act out some hitherto subdued homicidal urge of his own. Perhaps it was an act of desperation on the part of the writers to give the movie an extra shot in the arm to make up for substance they suspected was lacking.I also thought - given how many deaths there were at the early crash scene and then the gas station - the low key police presence on the streets of Haddonfield for the longest stretch of the evening seemed bizarre and absurd. Only when yet more bodies turned up, did there seem to be any real kind of manhunt. Even HALLOWEEN II (1981) presented a more realistic law enforcement reaction around Haddonfield to the crimes that had been only then just discovered. Bear in mind also, the infamy of Myers in this new timeline as a murderer well documented and studied over his 40 year incarceration and the furore that would surely follow his escape.I believe had there been more daytime scenes and patient buildup to the night terrors that lay in wait, the film would have greatly benefited. There was little structured pacing here. This was HALLOWEEN for the Millennium. A brief set-up, then straight in with the mayhem, brutality and barely 5 minutes without Myers onscreen in case our 2018 audience attention spans begin to wane and people start checking their SnapChats.Myers' spent so long in the original film (often offscreen) observing people and dogging their steps before choosing his moments to strike. Think of him watching Annie from a few feet away on several occasions at the Wallace house. Or standing in a doorway watching Bob and Lynda - both downstairs and upstairs - before toying with them and luring them to their deaths. Here we are frequently tagging along with him in the third person as he just nonchalantly walks into houses straight off the cuff and kills without any pre-selection or stalking. The victims seemingly have no tie-in to his pathology around reliving Judith's murder - while at the same time also have no connection to any implied plans he may have to target Laurie Strode and her kin. He spent a whole day in the original patiently observing and planning his movements around Haddonfield without strolling into peoples houses and viciously slaughtering whoever was just unlucky enough to live there. There's little subtlety or finesse to the kills either. No, this Myers will just stomp on your head if need be to get you out of the way.Maybe I'm too wrapped up in the original.......maybe I can't move with the times! But the makers of this were very vocal about this connecting directly to the original and dismissing all the sequels. For this reason, comparisons and close cross-reference to that film are perfectly in order. That said, even dismissing Carpenter's film, for me this was a badly paced, generic slasher with little suspense, almost no scares and plot deviations that are often pointless and not infrequently absurd. And for all the large talk about dismissing the sequels and directly following up the original - this had far more in common with those said sequels than it had Carpenter's film. For me, it was also inferior to several.A lot of the kills are pointless and brutal, very much out of sync with how Myers operated previously and worst of all - were more reminiscent of what I saw in Rob Zombie's celluloid catastrophes that sadly marked the series.Then at the resolution, after all Laurie's plans and convictions to finally ""end this"", she chooses to walk from a self ignited inferno, inexplicably leaving Myers breathing when she had him trapped in a basement before her, foregoing the option to pump him with endless rounds from any of the plentiful firearms she's been stockpiling for 40 years...........I audibly groaned at this point and got a dirty look from someone sitting in the row before me.This cheap and largely undisguised tactic to facilitate yet another addition to the series was perhaps the final insult to the audienceI really wish I had got more out of this and hope others manage to enjoy it but for me the film was light years short of the simple, yet powerfully effective concept that a low budget independent movie from 1978 presented to us..........and which I fell in love with on first viewing.I also found it terribly weak judged purely on it's own merits.Perhaps I'm just getting old and grumpy!!!",Halloween
919,jayparenteau,An Opener that Would Make any Filmmaker Blush,7,22 September 2019,"What a hot start Halloween has. It is beautifully shot and edited. If there is one thing that sticks out throughout the whole film it's sound design, and as a horror film, (especially one with such a slow creature,) it is required to be excellent throughout the entirety of the movie or the viewer will relapse and become an average cynic again. I too fell victim to this, but not because of sound design, believe me I was all in for that. The story was written in such a way that the call backs to earlier generations didn't feel forced or juggled, (at first.) In the opening scene all cylinders are firing, hits are happening at their perfectly timed moment and the shots are beautiful but with such a strong attention grabber the rest of the film is contrasted in its lacking of that effort. My favorite shot from the film happens about 2 minutes in when we get to see the ""courtyard"" or the ""mall"" with all the demented within their respected circles. It is a partial reason for me not loving the rest of film because I don't see anything like that again. The biggest issue with this film is its premise, and some would say, ""uhm then why'd you give it a 7."" To that I say, I went in with the mentality that its creature is ineffable, heck the characters would agree with that, and that's a reason, I, don't like it. However going in with that mentality and being pleasantly surprised with other areas of the film made me more ok with the motives of the villain. Eventually, all good things come to an end and the honeymoon phase of that cinephile pleasure was gone and then I was stuck watching the end going, ""Okay let's get to the resolution..."" They lost me, and because of that I gave this film a 7. It is re-watchable and I enjoyed many parts but if you hate Michael Meyers as an antagonist, watch the first 20 minutes and be done..",Halloween

I have been pretty much since day one.But this... this monstrosity of a movie should be buried deep... along with Rob Zombies Halloween 2.Why do I say RZ's Halloween 2?? Because even his first one was better than this... and that's saying somethingThis debacle of a movie is nothing short of dreadful and is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.This movie is basically a movie about the #metoo movement and is simply cashing in... The last 15 - 20 mins of the movie is basically 3 women torturing a man... and I couldn't help but feel... if this had been the other way around... 3 guys torturing a woman... this movie would never have seen the light of day... but oh yeah... I forgot... he's Harvey Weinstein ... Oh sorry... I meant the Boogeyman... So that makes it alright... Don't get me wrong... I'm all for equality... but not this... not this BS.I went to see this to get away from the real world and see something stupid and instead I was force fed almost 2 hours of political BS... You may say... You could have walked out at anytime.. but remember what I said at the beginning... I'm a massive fan and I sat there praying the film would miraculously get better... It didn't.If you are a die hard fan avoid at all costs... if you're caught up in all the Political Correctness BS hype you'll love it.If I've offended you, you've proved my point and I rest my case.Avoid at all costs",Halloween
921,loudog-69437,Absolutely Outstanding!,10,20 October 2018,"Dare I say it? This movie may be better than the original Halloween.
I cannot emphasize this enough: this movie is AMAZING! The sheer amount of horror and heart that went into this film is remarkable. The idea of having Laurie Strode being like Sarah Connor in terminator 2 is brilliant. She has been preparing for this night for a long time but everybody thinks that she's crazy. The film exceeds all of my expectations and standards not just as a great slasher film, but as a smart feminist pro #metoo movie. In the movie, the men are all ineffective or working against them. The women are the heroes who get stuff done and save the day. The movie also deals with the reality of trauma and how it affects not just the victim, but the people who surround them and the generations that follow. On top of all that, it's scary and atmospheric. Halloween is triumphant on all fronts and is one hell of a great movie.",Halloween
922,andreastowell,FINALLY MADE THE FINAL?,9,25 October 2018,"It wasn't very scary, but it was really good for one time or a 2nd.

923,colphughes,I was really looking forward to this,5,22 October 2018,"I'm so glad I didn't see H20. This movie ignores every sequel. If you don't accept this is the ONLY sequel following the 1978 original then you'll be asking questions all the way through. The only sequel that is, until they decide to do another replacement or reboot.40 years on and Laurie tells us she's been preparing and 'praying' for Michael to escape so she can KILL him. Such a powerful delivery and, with the multiple scenes with her handling her revolver and Winchester rifle, blowing holes in mannequins heads and chests, it looked like Laurie was going to be a badass to be reckoned with. In fact the trailer had me thinking of Sarah Connor's transformation in Terminator 2.When the time comes however, the only time she cracks off a shot is when she's within spitting distance or in mortal danger in a melee with Michael. The rifle was little more than a stick to prod at things and open cupboard doors.There was something nonsensical happening at every turn. I know it's a slasher movie, but I think we've moved on from the hapless victim tripping over a twig and crying uncontrollably.If you've been readying yourself for 40 years do you consider Michael a human capable of redemption or The Shape to be shot at without question? Do you choose a manual reloading long Winchester rifle, or a semi-automatic with a few magazines? Do you open a cupboard door or shoot it? Do you wander around a bunch of mannequins or just shoot them? With all the contraptions in the house had she never thought of putting a light bulb in any of the rooms? Why have a room full of mannequins anyway!?The basement panic room/trap was a great idea if they never kept leaving the remote control on the worktop. It also helps that when you're hiding to stay quiet and not shoot up through the floor to show where you are. When he falls down the stairs and is laying on his back, you with a rifle in your hands, do you put a few bullets in his brain for good measure? NO! You run up the stairs trap him and hope that by setting the house alight he's going to burn to death...... Because, of course, you didn't really want him dead otherwise there can be no sequel.This didn't feel like a sequel that meant to be believable or conclusive. Not well written. The characters were still weak. The cops were useless. Subplots and 'twists' were pointless.Very disappointed!",Halloween

Well acted, well shot and well edited! Though it has mostly good reviews, I really cannot understand some of the bad reviews. But I guess with the IQ Level of the vast majority of the population, it should not be surprising. Very powerful killing scenes as well! This is by far better than the sequels, though I liked the original H2. This is a masterpiece compared to the Rob Zombie Halloween movies! This is right up there with the original Halloween!

This film pays such respect to the original with lots of artfully crafted references that fans will easily grasp. If you're a fan of Halloween you'll love it. The atmosphere is chilling, eerie and heavy with suspense. Michael Myers is back, but so is Laurie Strode! If you want to be scared, let yourself, the film does the job!

It still doesnt hold a candle to the original, but it is light years ahead of any of the previous sequels, the best of which were mediocre.

This is not that.So much of the dialogue and ""teenage"" situations in this sequel are cringeworthy. I found myself rooting for Michael because some of the characters behaved so ridiculously. Now I understand it's hard to make a slasher horror picture since its been done hundreds of times at this point but look to recent films like It Follows or A Quiet Place, it can be done. These films bring the suspense and don't rely on forty-year-old nostalgia franchises to sell tickets.I'd recommend skipping this one. There's plenty of great films being made, no reason to waste almost two hours here.",Halloween

After 10 mins, it was kinda stale when it becomes clear its was reusing the same setup and plot lines. Nothing new or fresh. Still nothing to explain how a old guy like him moves like a ninja assassin or how he managed to maintain his strength. I can only assume he's been training very hard, pumping weights in prison, waiting for this Halloween to pick off a few teenagers.

946,jts09-1,More like PG-13- Big Disappointment,3,16 January 2019,If it wasn't for the language this installment of Halloween could have easily been a PG-13 film which is disappointing. The majority of the killing is done off screen and they're only a few killings we actually get to see. Of course we are rooting for Michael and big body counts with gore but it just doesn't happen. The ending is so incredibly dumb. You are going to booby trap your house for 40 years? waiting for Michael? who is in a secure facility....and you have a basement full of guns. This is more like a teenage pg horror film and does not deliver the true vision of the maniacal Michael Meyers.,Halloween
947,judge-fudge,Great Halloween Film,10,16 August 2019,If you're a fan of 'Halloween' or slasher films in general you'll love this film. It is one of the best we've had in any decade let alone the 2010s which is not exactly known for it's slashers in the same way as the 80s and 90s. It looks as though there are plans for a few more 'Halloween' films and I cannot wait. Hopefully they can usher in a resurgence in the genre.If you're a true horror fan you've probably become accustomed to ignoring bad reviews and that should be no different here. As a huge fan of the series I have no problem rating this film as highly as the first two. It's great in every way and does an excellent job of setting itself up for a handful of highly memorable scenes and kills. The special effects are fantastic and I will be eagerly looking forward to more 'Halloween' films in the future.,Halloween

The fact that it's a Halloween sequel makes it all the more special. Now I'm a big horror fan but have never been a huge slasher fan and although I do rate the original Halloween I've never been fussed with the rest in the series however Carpenter and the original cast pulled me in. This film has a good vintage/contemporary balance and builds nicely with some nice grisly kills. It's a slick movie, it's not scary but it does have an air of cool surrounding Myers where you find yourself gunning for him. I left the cinema feeling content that I'd seen a good movie, it had everything I'd expected and I have honestly never felt so content with a slasher movie.
Cool with substance but not scary.",Halloween

The tone is all over the place. The writing is cringe. Carpenter's score is peppered throughout but it makes me wish I was just watching his film. Too many subplots. Laurie Strode goes full Kevin McAllister with her wacky Home Alone style set up. The characters make stupid decisions. Laurie Strode designs this whole underground bunker with a secret trap door, but then leaves the bunker and shows where the secret door is. Why? Oh wait, that's right, TWIST! It was a trap! As explained by an actual line of dialogue saying, ""it was a trap"". Michael Myers trying to rip a cabinet off of the floor had me laughing hysterically. Many times I just bursted out laughing because of how corny and stupid it was. Wanted to leave halfway through but I stuck it out just in case. I just kept thinking, ok, I get it!

I watched the original 1978 film a few days ago and watched the new film tonight at Regal in RPX. This movie truly pays respects to the original in many, many ways. I would have to say the film makers took 1978 Michael and teleported him to 2018. They made him a brutal 2018 horror movie killer but left his demeanor and stillness as it was in the original. Sure there are differences, but both, the differences and likenesses, are what make this movie great. I thoroughly enjoyed the film through the eyes of my childhood self when I watched the original. The haters will be haters with their, ""Nothing new here"" attitude. I walked in skeptical.. uh, another reboot! But, I walked out wanting to see it again. I would actually like to give it a 5, but I will settle for a 4.75 for you haters out there.I read a review where they called this film a ""love letter to the original picture"", and I have to agree entirely.",Halloween

Do not fall for the hype of this once again failed attempt to somehow recreate the original. Please STOP trying, if you pay money to see this garbage you will be once again, if a true Halloween 1978 original, be not only sadly disappointed but you will be even more embarrassed you even thought you would get some satisfaction as you did from the original. It's all about the money and Jamie lee Curtis should be embarrassed about that awful performance. It's about money and I'm sure all her money she made in the 90's is obviously gone and like most actors who do not invest their money, they have to look pathtic onscreen when they are 70 and broke just to make a paycheck. Whoever started the rumer by saying Carpenter gave this trash his stamp of approval is really what the true trick was. He wouldn't be caught dead on the red carpet with anyone of these actors who sold their souls to this movie and once again embarrassed the Halloween name. The only good thing this movie did was being released it in October when the movie Halloween should be released. Everything you saw in the thousand previews is what you see in this movie. I'm literally embarrassed to even still be a Halloween movie fan because it's been destroyed once again and now the joke is all on us. I shame anyone that gives this movie more than 1 star on here because if you see that it's a robot making fake reviews just to get you in the seat. When you see this movie advertised so many times that is a sign that they are trying to do anything they can just to get you into that seat but please I'm telling you as your average semi real everyday movie critic who knows a good movie when I see one please save your money and don't give this movie any money as it's just one giant money making trick and has not a second of any actual real old school substance. Trust me your thinking how could David Gordon green know anything about horror, well shocker he doesn't. He is East bown and down right a joke to have any say in a franchise like this one. From the editing to the horrid use of the original score that was probably better if no score was even used at all to the poor acting, poorly use of comedy, to the obvious use of making sure to get all races their due and their part, it's Hollyween Hollyweird Hollywood trash and once again all about money. Save your money and wait for this to come on AMC in about a month when it should becuae even if this movie was one AMC right now for free I would turn the channel and watch Dateline instead.

957,waywarddrifters,So much potential -mostly wasted,4,23 November 2019,"I'm a huge fan of the original film, and I even like the first two sequels, but this film leaves more questions than answers. The acting is mostly strong, the editing is quite good, the effects and certain kills are pretty noteworthy, and Carpenter's score makes it feel a little like a Halloween sequel - hence my four stars. Where this film falls flat is the story. This is a story that could have been so much more stronger and cohesive, but became another unrealistic sensational cash-in. I mean, a journalist screaming in the courtyard of a mental institution? Michael leaving the obsessive doc alive when he crashes the bus? The doc suddenly becoming a murdering maniac who wants to be like Michael? At sixty-plus years old Mr. Myers is more agile than the twenty-something's he's after? I could go on ad nauseam about the various things that make this film less than the follow-up these characters deserve, but I'll cut to the chase. Is this flick better than the last few Halloween sequels? Yes, but the ""epic"" film that brings the story full circle it is not. Jamie Lee Curtis is wonderful in this, and her performance alone makes it worth a watch, but I sadly don't see myself adding this film to my collection. I had heard the praise. I had to see the film. I wanted to love it. But sadly there was so much potential here that was wasted, proving to me that they put making a buck over making a top notch movie.And if you think this isn't solely about money, explain the sequel they're currently filming?",Halloween

I neither loved or hated it like the many mixed reviews on here! Anyhow, for me there were quite a few cringe worthy monents in this film. One, the creepy friend of Laurie's granddaughter Allison, who attempts to have a #METOO Weinstein moment with her, but ends up (chin up; yes pun intended!) as a fence ornament by Michael. The other one being, Michael strangling a young boy to death (H4 & H5 had him trying to kill his niece who of course was a young child). However, this film was supposed to disconnect from previous sequels but mysteriously reconnects by adding a series of ""Easter Eggs"" from those aforementioned sequels!🤔🤔Overall, while NOT a perfect Halloween film, is by NO means the worst! I ALWAYS enjoy seeing Jamie Lee Curtis return and continue to breathe life into her character as Laurie Strode!

Perhaps coolest of all, we got an amazing movie that managed to be its own but to give us hardcore fans about a dozen winks throughout eluding to previous Halloweens (even the criminally underrated 4th and 5th). It was smooth in that it was so subtle. The newbies were oblivious. The only thing missing was throwing in a reference to the Rob Zombie films.

: The Godfather 2,
:The Empire strikes back,
:Terminator 2In my honest opinion, I will add Halloween 2018 to that list.I don't want to give too much away to those who haven't seen the movie yet, and are just browsing reviews, but rest assured whether you are a fan of the franchise or not, you will be thoroughly enthralled and entertained at the cinema.",Halloween

964,eveflower1970,"Happy birthday, Michael! 🔪",7,20 October 2018,"So, I just came home from the theater. Honestly, I don't regret a thing. ""Halloween"" (2018) is a pretty awesome remake. Looking at it as a simple horror movie, it's decent. But looking at it as a remake, since most of the remakes nowadays are extremely dissapointing, this is a well made remake.
The first half of it is below average, but don't judge the movie based on that.
The second half is really intense, and it keeps a lot from the original one, in terms of both scores and atmosphere.
I personally think that the key to enjoying this remake to the fullest is to see the original first. There are a lot of things you will notice and appreciate. Also, after watching this, my advice is to watch the original one, once again. Not because the remake is necesseraly bad, but sometimes it's better to go back in time a little and re-watch that good 70's stuff. Until then, stay thrilled 🔪",Halloween
965,brianaburton,"Not bad, but not good.",6,20 October 2018,"Halloween (2018) is one of those movies where you're not really sure how your supposed to feel about it. It's not necessary a good horror movie, but its not really a bad movie either. As a long time Halloween fan, I wasn't sure what to expect going into this movie since I had no idea who the director was or who the majority of the cast was. I wanted to believe this would be a fantastic movie, but I had to be realistic.The Pros: The music in this movie is great, John Carpenter, Cody Carpenter, and Daniel Davies did a really good job maintaining that classic halloween feel and mood with the music. There are some very good scenes with great use of music that really enhances the overall experience and sense that something horrible is about to happen.I also really enjoyed the cinematography in SOME areas of this film. There is one chase scene in particular where the way it was shot really showed how lonely the area really was and gave a huge feeling of dread.Michael Myers' acting was great. Nick Castle returned to play Michael Myers alongside James Jude Courtney and their body language, attitude, movements, everything was very spot on and nostalgic. I don't have any complaints regarding his re portrayal as Michael.Lots of easter eggs. There was a handful of scenes in this movie that replicated and paid homage to scenes in Halloween (1978), even the opening credits felt straight out of the original.The Cons: The colour grading is awful. A lot of horror films such as Saw, Martyrs, The Exorcist, and most importantly, the original Halloween, use a blue colour scale which gives a feeling of isolation, coldness, and anxiousness. This film uses a soft red/orange colour grade which makes everything seem to inviting and almost comforting? It just feels very out of place for the kind of film it is.The poor use of comedic relief. It does work in some areas of the movie where setting isn't supposed to be serious, but there are a couple of moments in this film where the use of jokes is extremely inappropriate and down right ridiculous. you CANNOT try to build a sense of dread and fear than throw in a joke 2 seconds later, it ruins everything.No sense of dread, no suspense, no build up. Every single time this film manages to start getting suspenseful it gets cut off instantly, everything happened way too quickly. There really is no sense of stalking in Halloween (2018), Michael just appears, kills someone, than the scene ends.Acting is poor. I wasn't really expecting anything amazing since horror movies nowadays have a relatively small budget with usually unknown actors, but some of the acting is really bad. I will admit some characters have their moments, but even Jamie Lee Curtis did fall flat in a few areas.I don't really have an opinion on the story. I think the idea and concept of it was very interesting, but I don't think the final product was executed as well as it could have been, but the ending of this film did seem to setup up a sequel in a very intriguing way.Overall, I give this film a 6/10, not good, but not bad. Would I watch a sequel to this? Yes. Would I recommend this movie? Most likely, since there really isn't any good horror movies out this halloween season.",Halloween

No back story to anything for this movie or strong details. If everyone has seen and paid attention to Halloween 1&2, Micheal killed 11 people, this movie they say he killed 6; Micheal NEVER would hide like in a closet or just kill random people, he had a mission; dr Loomis died in Halloween 2 by setting the fire to kill Micheal, but in this movie, they say Micheal killed him, which he did in Halloween 4, but this movie is only connected to Halloween 1&2; they say in this movie that Micheal and Laurie being brother and sister was a myth, ok explain that, provide proof, because ALL Halloween movies say they are related, we are just suppose to be ok with them not be related when that's how the movies have gone, said and admitted they were related, but also why else would he be after Laurie? The movie had some funny parts, that were made to be funny, and parts that weren't made to be funny but everyone laughed. This movie had stupid lines that just made no sense to the movie, parts of the movie that were just stupid and pointless.",Halloween

Positives
-It really felt like a sequal to the original and even had a 70's vibe.
It started off really strong-decent acting
-paid alot of homage to the original
Negatives
-Micheal was way more robotic and it looked weird at some points.
-the actors made really dumb decisions and I mean DUMB!!
-some of the kills were way over exaggerated

This film makes think they're making slasher films for families now, there were so many opportunities for this movie to be better. Where did the black cowboy come from? What was up with him? And how can you have a demented serial killer beat a woman to death with a hammer and walk by a crying baby and not stab it? The one unpredictable scene and it's for the worse not better! The film is filled with scenes that had potential and then were censored. WHERE'S THAT RAW SICK SLASHER FEEL? not here. The lovey-dovey grandmother mother daughter angle made me physically ill.

Rob Zombie's Halloween 2 was better than this horsecrap.,2,31 December 2018,"There's something about breaking the fourth wall in the wrong way that just sends an absolute shiver down my spine.When you think your audience is stupid enough that you need to assert a character as the ""new loomis"" more than half way into the movie when we already know he's the new loomis from the first 5 minutes, your garbage. I'm sorry, if that comes across as harsh, but thinking that, needing to assert that is harsh to us.Jamie Lee's performance, stellar. Mediocre granddaughter who i have neither the time nor ambition to look up the stage name for, eh. That cut rate actor who seems to popup a bunch of contemporary flick's like Jurassic World, even less so.This rendition of the Halloween franchise was as if Rob Zombie and John Carpenter had a baby (god forbid), and it tried to be aborted and it came out half ****** up and brandishing a kitchen knife. Why do they do this with a beloved series, I just don't get it. Leave a relic in the past if you have nothing more to add to it besides some stellar gore and culture bombed opinions. Don't just release it for the franchise name and the cash crop you can make off of it. This movie goes about how one would expect. I'll leave it to you to expect it.Halloween 5 was better than this shiz. And I mean that, really. Like I don't say that lightly here folks. I hated five. I hated it.

I enjoyed all the sequels to some extent including the Rob Z version.The main reason in my opinion is the Michael Myers character. This guy is pure evil and actually bad ass to watch.

Thought it was a really good movie and can't wait for the others to come out. I did not like the quick end and the Lauri versus Michael fight being so brief. Thought they could have done more with that. Also, not a fan that they made it to where she wasn't related to him. I thought that was perfect for his drive to kill her and everyone she loves. I had a bad feeling about the doctor after the crash too. Something told me he was behind it for some reason. Not a bad twist but one I saw coming.Now as far as sequels go this is too two for me. I liked it I'm just having a hard time figuring if I liked this one or H20 more. I may get blowback for it but I thought H20 was just as good if not a little better. Either way well done and I can't wait to see the new ones.PS. I do like that they made him more of a man again when he gets shot or hurt. He just do best keep taking bullets like in the other ones.

995,khughes1981,Should have left it alone,5,15 June 2019,"I had procrastinated in watching this for a long time, and when I finally did, I regretted it immensely. To put it simply, none of the films that succeeded the 1978 original were ever going to be a patch on it. Essentially, it's like T3 onwards in the Terminator franchise - it (Halloween) lacks Carpenter's touch, like how T3-5 lack Cameron's, and ultimately are all cash cows.I haven't scored a 1 or 2, as it did have some redemptions/positives. First of all, it was great to see Jamie-Lee Curtis reprise the role that broke her into the industry. The nods to Carpenter's original were also a good touch, as was the music. Some of the cinematography was reminiscent of classics such as Suspiria.The pacing, some of the acting, and the (at times, woeful) dialogue, made it lack the scares it was going for, ironically. Granted, I don't think the brilliant 'body swinging from the wardrobe' jumpscare in the original could ever be emulated.I read that there may be a possible sequel in the works.

There are only 3 things that I wish were different.At the asylum, after he twice said ""say something"", I think it would have had more of an impact if he then yelled ""Laurie Strode!!"" then Michael quickly turns around, us only seeing his shoulder then the Halloween theme kicks in. Since she was the one that got away before he was apprehended, that would have been much more powerful.The kid being babysat was completely unrealistic in that horrible moment. He would have been terrified like Tommy and Lindsay, not level headed enough to utter any words let alone be comical.Another thing that would have had a stronger impact is if they gave a close up & pause of Jamie Lee Curtis as she then says goodbye & tosses the flare. Given the 40 year history they tried to convey, that would have been powerful.Other than that, loved the movie and loved Jamie Lee Curtis and her brilliant performance of a PTSD victim. I CANNOT WAIT for the sequels in 2020 and 2021. However, if they kill off Laurie Strode, even heroically, I won't bother to go see them.

The writers for this Hallloween in comparison to all of the other 'sequels' really understands the natural progression of those characters which made the story that much more satisfying to jump back into.One observation I couldn't help but notice was how the teens/early-twenties crowd really wasn't into it. I guess If you grew up through the ""paranormal activity era"" of horror it's going to be a hard watch for you. Don't expect back the back jump scares like how almost every horror movie released nowadays lives & dies on.

1003,marvidpro,"Solid, though not as good as i'd hoped",7,23 October 2018,"I probably went in with really high expectations, but I left Halloween a little disappointed. It was a solid horror movie, I would rank it the 4th best of the Halloween movies. It just, IMO could have been better. I would still give the Carpenter original the nod as the best, followed by Halloween 2--not the Rob Zombie mess, but the underrated sequel. 3rd would go to the Halloween when Jamie Lee Curtis returned, set in a military school I believe, I thought that was a very solid movie. This one falls right after that.
BTW the following review contains spoilers!Specific things that I didn't like were the just randomly crazy physiatrist that had evidentially been working for 20 years and no one knew he was insane. It just seemed a little convenient to me that he was nuts and helping MIchael out. The other thing was the very promising duo of English medical journalists getting killed off mid movie. I found this fairly jarring, believing since the few adds that they were major players in this movie and finding out they were relatively minor characters. Why build up a character just to off them so unceremoniously?
But the good out weighs the bad. Jamie Lee Curtis is really good in this role. The ending is exciting and has some genuine suspense as she follows Michael around her fortress like house, and all in all the actors and director do a very solid job in this movie.
I just would have liked to see those two English characters having a more substantial role /storyline purpose, and definitely could have done without the cliché crazy for no reason doctor.",Halloween
1004,msmithlacunacoilfan1990,"A Frustrating, But Often Exhilarating, Horror Sequel",6,9 January 2019,"Halloween (2018)Director: David Gordon GreenWhat can I say about this movie? I love the 1978 original, it is tense, atmospheric and still to this day, very unsettling. When I found out they were doing ANOTHER sequel, I almost chose to ignore it. But then I found out they were erasing all the previous sequels from this timeline, and Halloween 2018 would be the official sequel, 40 years on. Now that really intrigued me, especially when it became apparent it was moving forwards with John Carpenters consent and input, and a returning performance from the original Scream Queen herself, the legendary Jaime Lee Curtis.But let's not forget that the previous sequels were, to put it as nicely as possible, a mixed bag. For me, only the first sequel and the 1998 surprise hit Halloween H20 (which also erased much of the franchises timeline, choosing to eradicate from canon all the previous sequels except the first) were any good. I am happy to say that, for the most part, Halloween 2018 measures up quite nicely to these two.I will start with the good: a really decent cast. Great soundtrack. Great build up. Great cinematography, which keeps the film looking and feeling a lot like the first. This is a very old fashioned (but not dated) looking horror movie.To keep this as spoiler free as possible, I will just praise the obvious: The initial killing spree once Myers returns is absolutely incredible to watch, and it's chilling to a level that matches the original. The deaths are inventive, but most importantly all the most horrific scenes are acted very well, whilst not being as gory as you might expect ( and no less effective for it either). For the first two thirds of its runtime, Halloween 2018 is a five star horror.But oh boy, it messes up on its way to the end. Laurie Strode (Curtis) apparently forgot she was in the Halloween franchise and stepped over into Home Alone; we have a really cheesy thread of story concerning a doctor (who at one point is referred to obviously as being ""the new Loomis"") who has a dastardly plan to observe and record Myers behaviour now he is free (ok I admit this is a bit of a spoiler), and then we have a very quick ending which left me with the impression the story isn't quite over.Again.Oh boy, this was a really frustrating movie. Jaime Lee Curtis returns, and does a fine job creating empathy for a character that by the end seems to be as crazily phycotic as the insane murderer she fears so much. It isn't the worst character development, and is handled quite well, but she came off almost cartoonish at times. We understand she went through a hell of an ordeal in 1978, but with the erased timeline, which indicates absolutely no traumatic events in the meantime, it is hard to understand why she has never recovered fully. As one character said at the start of the movie, in the grand scheme of things what happened to the town and Strode in the first movie is hardly the worst ordeal known to man. That this movie fails to fully justify her current paranoia and obsession with Myers returning, it's hard to really take her too seriously.Along these lines, her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) is portrayed as dismissive and in her own way very damaged by the intense fear and paranoia that her mother has never been able to let go of. This element had a lot of potential to dig deeper into the phycological nature of trauma, and with the right script we could have had a very different movie telling a stronger story of what it is like to live with PTSD and the very real horror that can come from it. Unfortunately, by the time things kick off, her role felt forced and the character appears to be the film makers desperate attempt to set up a new protagonist should Curtis ever retire. This brings us to Laurie Strodes granddaughter Allyson, played incredibly well by Andi Matichak. For me she gave a standout performance in a role that could easily have been phoned in. She didn't come across a typical scream queen, and I thought she lived up well to Jaime Lee Curtis original performance in the first movie. Nothing original going on here, just a really great performance that helps keep the show going.One of the minor issues I had with this movie was that there were no strong characters presented outside of the mother/daughter/granddaughter unit. All the male characters felt immediately like potential victims or comic side relief, and the police seemed far too comical at times to ring true. I did wonder if this was intentional, perhaps a commentary on how few horror movies there are where the girl wins without needing to resort to relying on a man. And had it been executed with more subtlety and stronger characters, it could have worked and been very clever. But it felt quite shallow, and whilst I hesitate to call this film sexist, it did feel a little frustrating that to make the female characters more convincingly strong they had to downplay the male roles. Perhaps I am just overthinking.There is good and there is bad in this movie. When it hits the right notes (which is fairly often), it is a great movie. I recommend the movie for the first half especially, but I think the ending is going to be divisive and split opinion down the middle. As far as cheesy horror endings go, I enjoyed it. It felt very hokey and reminded me of a lot of the horror movies that came out in the 90s after the massive success of the first Scream. Personally, it's a style of horror I always enjoy, especially when done well (Halloween H20, Urban Legend, Cherry Falls and the more recent meta-horror Cabin In The Woods come to mind as movies I enjoy, even if the quality does vary considerably).Halloween 2018 is just fine. It had the potential to be a very effective and scary horror, and I am sure for many less ardent horror fans it will work just fine. But it has its flaws, which left me wanting a lot more from the experience. One of my most anticipated movies in years ended up being a fun, yet rather empty, viewing experience.6/10",Halloween
1005,TheFewSick,Genuinely Satisfying,8,26 October 2018,"This was easily the best Halloween film outside of the original. There were little bits I thought it could have improved on (Haddonfield is still a one cop town?) and a minor plot twist that should've been handled differently but otherwise I really, really liked the film.The comedic scenes were actually funny, the kills were intense, the cinematography and use of the shadows was balanced and eerie, Carpenter's score was elevated and improved on and the general story was simple but effective.Without going into spoilers, I especially enjoyed the way this film flips the script and becomes more of a story about the survivor and the effects of trauma on the victim. This is what a soft reboot should be.

1008,mrharrybond,Halloween Reborn!,8,20 October 2018,"I went to see Halloween tonight at the latest showing. The cinema was hardly packed and this is actually great for Horror Movies as you don't have others screaming for the fun or making loads of noise, the whole cinema was silent which was great for HALLOWEEN.Halloween is a direct sequel to the original Halloween which made the pre-judgement of the movie very wary as I wasn't sure what to expect as I really enjoyed H20.Halloween 2018 began very slowly (as I felt) it seemed as it dragged on for a bit and didn't seem too much of a horror and more of a drama (which isn't all bad) however it kind of took a chunk of time up linking in storylines that were pointless, for example the lead teen girl's boyfriends relationship was actually a pointless involvement with the story line as nothing comes out of it.The death scenes were great and it was good to see a big movie feature with gory death scenes, the camera angles were some of my favourite, you didn't know what to expect within each scene and I was always waiting for a jump scare, I'm not sure if it was intentionally, however some scenes featured items on the side of the scene which you were never sure if this was Micheal or a item ready to jump out.This movie is definitely not a disappointment to the series and died hard fans will appreciate the movie more then past movies like H20, Micheal began becoming more of a supernatural element within other movies instead of a human serial killer, this movie has made Micheal be more realistic again and gives great character build between the main character however it would of been great to see more character build around the teenagers and the mother.",Halloween

1013,smmb-75867,Beautiful and Entertaining,8,31 October 2018,"The Halloween franchise is rich in different story arcs and interpretations of the main characters of the films. However, most attempts at writing these characters, especially The Shape, have fallen short of interesting and convincing. That was my opinion until Halloween (2018). The writing of the two main characters were approached in a compelling way and I feel the 40 year gap between this movie's story and the original film's story (1978) helped in a brilliant way.
Laurie is a different person 40 years later and is now a fearful, but prepared person. She knows that one day Michael Myers will escape which fears her, so she has done what she could to prepare for his return.
The Shape was the same familiar killer, but with added depth to his violence and figure. Even though he is now in his 60's, he was still capable of very horrific murders and it can be shown in his strength and aggression.
Technically, this movie is beautiful. The pacing, editing and cinematography were well put together and created a very stressful experience for viewers. The use of long takes were cleverly implemented to help with the flow of certain scenes and keep the viewers engaged and immersed in the film.
There are a few negatives about this film 's creative choices with the story, but you will have to view the film yourself in order to understand my opinion.
Overall, Halloween (2018) was a beautifully shot film with exceptional characters, but with a few faults. Easily one of the best movies in the franchise and one of the best horror films of this year (2018).",Halloween
1014,mlre,Wow! Halloween is back!,10,30 October 2018,What a thrill ride from start to finish this film is. The music was spot on and used correctly thanks to John Carpenter being involved. The early scene when the viewer is introduced to Micheal and his mask in Smith's grove really sets the tone of the movie. We got guard dogs and the patients going completely nuts. The camera angles used throughout the film did a great job of keeping Michael's face out focus but when he does put the mask on we get a lot of views of it. It reminded me the original and was just as scary. The ending was interesting and I'm excited to see the direction the sequel is headed. I definitely think Myers is dead this time.,Halloween

1023,RewatchersSalute,"Redeem Me Up, Laurie",8,20 November 2018,"Background.
Something far scarier than a knock of tricks and treats at the door lurks around another late October. The latest sequel in a franchise that began with John Carpenter, picks up 40 years after the 1963 murders on Halloween where Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) must once again face the masked, Michael Myers.Highlight!
Despite relying heavily on the 1978 original, this Halloween film slices off the non-integral parts and there are great reasons for it. The previous sequels were part of the over-saturation of slasher films causing audiences to no longer be surprised but in 2018, here is a film that fills a void not realized before. Halloween 2018 is a reminder to audiences of the impact that characters have on making sequels. Though its interesting to see the hauntingly, similar yet modernize take of the everyday teen unaware of eminent danger, it is the strength in Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode that makes the film as successful as the original, the cornerstone of slasher horror along with, of course, the knife of Michael Myers.Remarkable?
Though the original Halloween film made the slasher/icon, Michael Myers and united a generation of horror fans, it is David Gordon Green's 2018 worthy successor that boldly excludes the other sequels in favor of renewing the slasher for a new generation to understand how fear brings audiences together without trying to stab a history lesson of the franchise into them, notwithstanding some inspiration from the original Laurie Strode.Here's to fighting for the mindset that if the wicked never rests, we'll find a way to change that and it won't be in peace!

Little did I know, it had the perfect elements of a paranoid sister hiding her whole life from a psychotic brother(Boogeyman???). The paranoia that this movie gave Laurie Strode was amazing. It goes to show how the first movie affected such a loved character and made her even more badass. They stuck to the original storyline, and even introduced a new, more insane Dr. Loomis. Of course, his apprentice.
I think everything about this movie was amazing and stuck to its original concept. Much more character development, along with a perfect cliffhanger ending.

Fan PointOfView: In post-apocalyptic world if Halloween was the last movie preserved I'd still burn it and bury it somewhere deep in a forest. What could have been a great throwback to original with Jamie Lee Curtis back and big support from the studio turned out to be nothing more than a director's self pleaser. David Gordon Green kind of just meshed all the previous movies into one. There's bit of each Halloween movie put into this and it just doesn't work. Plot is falling apart by each passing second and there's so many subplots to follow but none that has any meaning or closure. There's this Loomis-like crazy doctor running around and he is even crazier than Michael Myers and just bunch of Strode family members who appear at random places and then there's Jamie Lee Curtis who's been waiting 40 years for Michael to come in her house which Macaulay Culkin booby trapped with... dolls? I'm actually mad at this movie for turning out so bad because it could have been great in hands of an adept filmmaker. There's just too many coulds, shoulds and woulds about new Halloween.

1046,terrywatt69,"Not as bad as it potentially could have been, but by no means great",5,19 October 2018,"Older, longtime fan of the series, who can remember when the 1978 Halloween was released and felt fresh. Having said that, the films that came after Carpenter's original have been, for the most part, wanting. Even the stronger of the sequels (1981's Halloween 2, Halloween H20, Halloween 4) still never quite measured up. What tends not to be mentioned regarding Carpenter's original film is that he kept it simple not solely due to an inventive masterstroke, but because he had to: he had less than half a million dollars to make Halloween. However, Carpenter also knew how to craft suspense and that what you think you see/your imagination is always more potent than explicit violence.
Halloween 2018 I will give credit for in terms of making a sincere attempt (in parts)at getting back to the core basics Carpenter utilized. It was clear watching Halloween 2018 that a certain degree of care was taken in not wanting to churn out another pointless sequel. What ended up happening was an inadvertent rehash of Halloween 1978. Sort of a mild soft reboot with some tweaking here and there as a nod to current tastes and some obligatory hardcore Halloween fan servicing in terms of quick shots paying homage to the films that came before it.
I'd say Jamie Lee Curtis aka Laurie Strode was the most interesting aspect of Halloween 2018. However, I went into this fully expecting (against hope) for it to go off the rails. About 2/3rd's to 3/4's of the way through, sure enough it did. Right about the time Michael's psychiatrist went homicidally looney, the movie took a sharp turn away from reality, and the concluding scenes in Strode's booby-trapped house were a letdown.
I have come to the realization I have long suspected, that Carpenter's original WAS a combination of a creative masterstroke and maximizing a limited budget. It took all the elements of Halloween 1978 (director/score composer/writer, actors, production crew, concept and the era in which it was made) firing on all cylinders to make it work so well. Those conditions were never able to be replicated with subsequent releases, and by now the entire Myers concept has been so diluted, reconstituted and recombined the whole business feels tired. As for Halloween 2018, I'll put it just a notch below 1981 Halloween 2, Halloween H20, and Halloween 4: at its best Halloween 2018 is able to echo some of what made Carpenter's version so effective...at its worst, just as silly as some of the lesser sequels despite the amount of concentration and care that so obviously went into 2018, In addition, Halloween 2018 is needlessly gory and a bit too wide-ranging in terms of trying to roll too many elements (visual homages to the original, fan service, pointless lengthy secondary character development) into the fold. Bottom line: clearly evident by now that Carpenter's version is the only version that worked really well - stop trying to recreate/replicate it. Come up with something new as opposed to pumping a dry well.",Halloween

I expected a good horror because of the rating, even though I'm not a fan of Halloween (or serial killer ""horrors* generally). But this movie is so bad that I had to write a review.
The movie starts well enough but then turns into ""what happened?"" situations.
For example, when Michael escaped the buss, I guess the whole situation was too hard to write, so they just left that part out.
Same with him killing two cops who had guns. Too hard to write, let's just leave it out and fast forward to the cops being dead.

It has a pretentiousness to it that is misplaced by filmmakers who claimed to have love for the material, yet have only produced what I'd consider to be weak, predictable fan service. Not even the slightest thread of logic can hold the narrative together. Things happen because ""reasons"". It's a series of ""REMEMBER THIS"" and ""REMEMBER THAT"" moments intermixed with what passes as ""humor"" in the modern era and what passes for horror (jump scares). Michael Myers has no reason, by the movie's own rules, to have interest in Laurie Strode yet Laurie has spent her entire life preparing for the encounter which only comes to be by some contrived plot twist. The twist itself seemed like the only creative turn in the entire movie, so of course it was dispatched with tout de suite. This movie was such a complete and utter let down upon seeing it at the theater, and upon a second viewing at home is almost sickening with the cringy, inept writing and lost potential. Again, I cannot help but reiterate that by the movies own rules the chances of Michael Myers, the now random killing machine, happening upon Laurie Strode or her family in a town of hundreds or thousands of people is infinitesimal. Do the filmmakers just assume the audience has an IQ of 10?",Halloween

The fact that it had Jamie Lee Curtis makes it worth seeing and gives it it's 2-star redeemability. First off, they keep showing Michael's face... that basically breaks one of the most important Halloween rules. Secondly, they claim that Laurie Strode (as portrayed by Curtis) is no longer related to Michael in the story, which is disorienting. Thirdly, I was disappointed with the music. Carpenter made his own iconic music for the original. While they did use ""the theme"" they had an overly sped-up version at times with the piano melody, and minimized or completely losing the ominous, classic, base synthesizer part. Then they supplemented it with modern and cheaply repetitive horror-dubstep-noise that will be almost entirely unused in 5 years. They followed Myers around with a camera to much, detracting from the sense of an always imminent mysterious presence. The movie wasn't really scary. Hopefully they use the profit for another better one.",Halloween
1056,wfjohnston14,The Sequel it Needed,7,8 November 2018,"While this didn't break new grounds in the way of horror or slasher films, it is about what I expected for a Halloween sequel, maybe even more. Michael Myers is perfectly portrayed and shot, bringing back all the tension from the original classic. Jamie Lee Curtis is bad ass, bring extra gritty, and a true hero. The only place the film falters in its newer aspects.Halloween follows in The Force Awakens footsteps: it takes the original film and tells an extremely similar but slightly different variation. A while ago, I would have seen this as a bad angle for a sequel but after the failed attempts, going back to familiar ground was rewarding. But the new characters are not great. Laurie's daughter is fine, with her grandchild being really good, but the high school friends, reporters, doctors, and police have little purpose. The doctor is a nod to Loomis (Michael's personal doctor). The head police officer was present long ago (though little is done otherwise with him). And the reporters get the story off its feet but that's it. The film flourished in the familiar areas. Michael Myers was terrifying. Plain and simple. He is a force to be reckon with. I am one for gritty characters too so seeing Laurie being where she is at the beginning of the story, it made me very happy. It was also very believable, because yeah, she did witness her friends dying 40 years ago. It's very traumatizing.The horror aspect relied heavily on suspense and gory moments with a few jump scares. The tension has high in two spots, his return to Haddonfield and final confrontation at Laurie's house. The long take was effective for showing Michael simply being a killing machine (also how he thrusted the knife in the woman's throat was bone chilling). The final confrontation was tension at its peak and then some. Even when we knew where Michael had to be, things still managed to get more uneasy. The violence is not always shown but extreme. None of it was unexpected, considering some of the content out there now, but it was still gruesome none-the-less.It didn't click on all cylinders but did what I had intended and went above and beyond in the horror part.

The original obviously being an all-timer but the rest of the sequels are, well.... not so good.But this 2018 sequel had a great feel to the original- it made you feel like this really was connected to the original events 40 years ago. Good story, good suspense, and really good performances from the cast- especially Jamie Lee Curtis.All that combined easily makes this the best sequel of the series.",Halloween

But with all high grossing movies, a sequel is inevitable. This sequel was just bad. Long drawn out scenes, many made no sense. Very little character building. Couldn't wait for this one to end.",Halloween
1059,stephanie-jones21,Halloween II: Part Two?,7,18 October 2018,"Halloween 2018? Halloween II: Again? The name isn't the only thing wrong with this movie. I want to start off by saying, I don't want my opinion to change the mind of anyone else that wants to see this film. I ultimately liked (not loved) Halloween. It was entertaining and fits in with the Halloween franchise. I had such high hopes for this movie and was a little disappointed. 
Here's what I liked: the classic Halloween movie vibes, Michael's mask, the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis came back for another, it's Rated R kills, and it had some seriously funny parts. 
What I didn't like: too many character stories to follow, not enough Laurie Strode, and the movie was very much predictable. I feel as though they tried to make it an old-school slasher from the 80's to follow the other movie, and to me, it didn't hold up against current horror films. But I DID enjoy it, I do want to watch it one more time to gather a final decision of how I feel about it.",Halloween

1063,jmayb1126,Fun but not as good as it was hyped to be,7,6 November 2018,"I'm a huge fan of the franchise, particularly the first 2 films. I'm a horror fan in general so when I first heard about this movie I was super excited to see it. I was one of the apparent few who actually loved H20 even with its flaws. I would compare this one to that.It was a lot of fun to watch and had many scenes that brought me right back to the original. The opening credits were enough to get me going by themselves. I'm always thrilled to watch Jamie Lee Curtis go head to head with Michael Meyers and she can really do no wrong in my opinion. I also thought there were some great funny scenes, particularly the child who was being babysat. Before I get into the negative part of my review I wanted to make it clear that I really did find the film enjoyable, despite the many issues it has. I feel that any other true fan will feel the same.The movie had a few characters that could have been left out completely and also a couple that I think should have gotten more screen time. Time to just develop their character a little more. The movie felt very rushed at times. You dont get the same feel as the first one where that is concerned. Michael seemed to just kill quickly without any rhyme or reason and without stalking his prey like we know he loves to do.The reporter journalist people in the beginning were pointless. Their whole thing made no sense and I feel that if they wanted to use that narrative that they should have either taken it all the way or just left it out completely. I also could have done without some of the weird high school scenes and the also pointless boyfriend character. I think a few tweaks to the script and an extra 30 minutes could have made a huge difference.The worst and I mean WORST part of this movie is the doctor. I cant stand what they did with his character. So stupid.Even with all of that though I'd go see it again and I'm sure I'll watch it every Halloween season just as I do the rest of the franchise! Any true Halloween fan will love it despite its flaws. If you're not super into the franchise or this is your first experience with it, It might not be your cup of tea.",Halloween

I've seen all of them, and they're all fun (or at least enjoyable) in their own ways. Even the REALLY bad ones. So I was really excited to see this movie, as it was marketed as a return to form rather than just another campy slasher. Some things were really good! I enjoyed the relationship between Laurie and her daughter, and it went in a direction that I thought was very satisfying! The end, though somewhat reminiscent of Home Alone, was a lot of fun for me! Michael was also pretty cool and intimidating in some scenes! Unfortunately, these were the only really captivating things about the story. A lot of the movie just drags on, and most of the story lines that are set up either aren't very interesting (like the subplot with her granddaughter) or just don't go anywhere (the knockoff Loomis) There are good things here, so check it out if you're curious, but for me, a lot of it just felt pointless.",Halloween

1067,technetium-94107,Please make it stop,2,20 December 2018,"Please please make it stop. No, not Michael Myers, these awful remakes of this once classic horror movie. Time and time again we are subjected to the same story, same killings, same everything. We've seen it all before, the only reason they keep making these movies is because they make so much money on such a low budget (in comparison to other movies) so why wouldn't they?There is nothing new here, Michael Myers escapes mental hospital again (Really lax security apparently for one of the most dangerous serial killers known to man), goes on a stabbing rampage and kills loads of teens (again).The thing that gets me the most about Michael Myers is his amazing ability to take direct headshots from multiple types of firearm and still survive. He's the boogeyman though right? So of course he can. Ok so why is he locked up in a mental hospital if he isn't human? Why has the doctor who has been studying him for 40 years not found out why he has special powers? Why are the government not trying to harness the bulletproof technology? But wait..whats this? He can take bullets to the head but he cant take someone biting his fingers? hmmm. Also his fingers can get blown off so why cant his head? Nothing, absolutely nothing about Halloween makes sense. I can forgive the first ever Halloween if they had left it at that but they didn't.So with all of these obscene discrepancies, you can no longer enjoy or take any of these sequels seriously anymore, they are parody, like all the Friday 13th Films.I hope this is the last ever movie to feature Michael Myers because if he survives that fire at the end.....i wont be able to cope.",Halloween
1068,egehanci,Quite Disappointing,6,3 January 2019,"Yes, I know Halloween movies generally don't get the highest of reviews - but I really thought they had stepped up their game for this after a different intro to the other movies.
Aside from some good spooky moments with the original soundtrack and Michael going on a rampage, the movie seemed to lack in general acting and some characters just didn't seem to fit in. I mean, how dumb can the mother be, shouting from the inside of the basement when he is going around the house? It's not realistic enough.
I thought the doctor, the grandmother and the lady journalist were very good (Jason as good as ever) but without the people acting in their roles, I would've downgraded this.
I liked the movie in general but I don't understand all of the hype surrounding it; hopefully the future director can take some of the successful points from this movie and create an even better film if there is a new halloween movie which I'm sure there will be.",Halloween

Every scene looks very obvious and you know what's going to happen next. Nothing surprise you. But in general, it is a good movie, it's not bad. It got that halloween spirit and that slasher spirit so if you could ask me if you should go watch it, yes, go watch it.",Halloween
1072,michael-48656,Well crafted studio film without the dark suspense of the original,6,21 October 2018,"Halloween (2018) is a well crafted film that manifests the professional filmmaking acumen we would expect from a major Hollywood production. Especially when the film focuses on the survivalist life Laurie Strode carved out for herself since her first encounter with The Shape, and the familial dysfunction that resulted, the dialogue and the visual storytelling are adept and, at times, even compelling. We believe that Laurie is trapped inside her fears. We care that her granddaughter tries to maintain a normal relationship with her. The theme of women's empowerment that becomes more central in the third act therefore has greater resonance than it would have had if this family backstory had not been pursued as well as it was. The film works then when focusing on Laurie Strode overcoming her own lifelong demon and, ultimately, turning the story's predator into prey.The problem with Halloween is everything else. As a horror, Halloween disappoints. Much has been written already about the lack of ""atmosphere"" and ""building dread,"" especially in comparison to the first two films. For the most part, those insights are true. Michael Myers kills, often much more viciously than in the first film, and since the film abandons Halloween II (meaning no sibling rivalry and no Samhain curse) he kills without any motive other than the fact that he is ""pure evil."" Nevertheless, in order to keep the story pace moving (perhaps in acknowledgment of the relatively limited attention span of younger audiences today) the film does not take the time to show Michael stalking his victims. He does not slowly creep out from the shadows. He just steps into the frame with his weapon of choice in hand and dispatches his next victim. In that respect, he is more like Jason Voorhees, and thus I was not all that surpised when I heard some people in the theater audience tonight chanting the ""ki ki ki ma ma ma"" mantra from the old Friday the 13th movies. Michael is an incredible force who can smash a human head with one stomp of his boot heel, as Jason could knock off a human head with one punch, but like his counterpart in the later Friday the 13th movies he is proportionately less scary as he is more violent.Graphic violence, like the infamous ""jump scares"" we see all too often in horror films nowadays (especially in the Blumhouse variety), actually releases tension in favor of the cheap thrill. Part of the genius of the original Halloween is that there is almost no blood in the film. Moreover, in that first film, most of the murders are obscured by darkness (the boyfriend stabbed to the wall) or haziness (Annie's death inside the parked car seen through a fogged up windshield), which invites us to extend our own imaginations to the scenes. Also, the murders in that first film always happen in one continual shot. There are no fast cuts which allow us to see the murder happen from multiple angles. The result is that we witness the murders as if frozen in one spot not too far from the action. The fact that we see multiple angles of the murders in Halloween (2018) makes those murders ""more cinematic"" and, therefore, ""less visceral."" We see the violence, but with all that sophisticated editing we are always reminded that this is a movie.Detractors have commented that there is too much comedy. If we see Halloween (2018) as more of an action than a horror film, then the comedy is appropriate. It is all too apparent that the filmmakers are trying to appeal to the post-Scream, meta sensibilities of younger audiences; and perhaps they are correct in acknowledging that audiences today would much rather be entertained than frightened. I prefer the dark menace and the slower, creepier pace of older horror films (Black Christmas, 1974; The Shining, 1980). I think that may have to do with the fact that as a man in my mid-forties I grew up before the Internet and social media. I read books (the old fashioned kind that are bound in leather and collect dust) and learned to appreciate the slow and steady build to the heart thumping climax. Today's instant gratification culture does not seem to have the patience for that, and I think that that is reflected in how films now are edited. That is also reflected in the preference of the sudden thrill or the cheap laugh over the ""slow build."" Would Kubrick have been able to distribute The Shining in today's marketplace? For that matter, would Carpenter have been able to find a mass audience for the original Halloween in our times? Or would those classic horror films, if released today, have been relegated to the niche community of horror enthusiasts. I suspect the latter.I have a few more quibbles with the film. Apart from Jamie Lee Curtis, who really captures the unsettling brew of weakness and strength in Laurie Strode, the acting is mediocre, though that is to be expected with a mainstraem horror or action film. There is virtually no character development for the victims, apart from the father, so we really do not care when they are dispatched. There is subtle foreshadowing of the plot twist with the doctor in the third act, especially in what the doctor says to the podcast interviewers before the opening credits. Nevertheless, the plot twist is too extreme and, as such, works against that suspension of disbelief needed for a film like this. I did like the ending, though. Fire symbolizes purification, and for Laurie in the end burning away the psychological entanglements of the past is frankly more important than making sure The Shape is dead. Ultimately, this is Laurie's story, so the redemptive value of the film is in Laurie freeing herself and her loved ones from that protective prison in which she has been hiding for the past forty years.",Halloween
1073,kawecx,I'm so disappointed John Carpenter,3,9 October 2021,I was not on the edge of my seat at all. No suspense! And Jamie Lee Curtis as a producer should have been better at channeling Laurie and know how the movie should've played out. Ohhh and I love my curse words but somehow all the F-words said by the teenagers made this movie all the more eye-rolling. I have this as a 3 star because of the Halloween theme song and I love Jamie Lee Curtis as an actress (.....but H20 was better than this). What made the first Halloween so great was the simplicity of it and the quietness....you always sat on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen next just based on the music playing and the cinematography.

The comedy isn't forced and is actually funny and acting is really good, all of this makes for a great sequal to the 1978 hit by John Carpenter. The story is compelling (apart from a certain twist concerning the Dr. in the third act) and the kills are better and more brutal than they have ever been - even better than Rob Zombie's Halloween. Danny McBride and David Gordon Green were miraculously able to mix Rob Zombie's Michael Myers and John Carpenter's Michael Myers together which makes this Michael Myers the best we have ever had - Even better than Nick Castles portrayal of the masked figure.",Halloween

Cliches left and right, with every male character bar the sheriff written as nuts, a loser or comic relief.
Making callbacks to the other films in the franchise (that it dismisses narratively anyway) does not make a good movie. Why would it?

1082,oanamiruna-64527,Movie of the year,10,19 October 2018,"This movie was either going to be garbage like rob zombie's remakes or it was going to be better than all the other sequels . And let me tell you , it's for sure better than all the other hallowen movies (Besides the original , that one will always be the best) . They kept releasing teasers , trailers and photos and i thought this was going to be one of those movies where they show all the action in the trailers and the movie will be boring as hell but no , i wasn't bored even for one second . I had my eyes glued to the movie the hole time . It had the action it needed to have , it had the terrifying factors in it that make you shiver , it had the feeling the first one did , it had the right atmosphere , it gives you the chills . I saw a few people say that they didn't like the movie because Michael is being thoughtless in here because he's killing everybody ...? Well , he's a serial killer and he wants to get to Laurie so he kills everybody who is in his way . It's a slasher movie , what do you expect him to do , sing them a lullaby until they go to sleep so he can continue his little walk in haddonfield ?
And if we're talking about killing now , i didn't expect Michael to have those brutal kills . I mean , no Halloween movie had so many and such brutal kills as this one did . They had some pretty good ideas for the methods of killing the characters , i got chills when i saw a few of them .
Another good thing is that they actually did a good job mixing comedy with the movie and the context of the scenes . I would've liked if they wouldn't have made a funny scene out of a scary scene *jumpscare scene* . If you want to make a funny scene , make one . If you want to do a scary one , do a scary one but don't mix them . It kind of ruins the mood when everybody in the theater starts laughing .
Jamie's acting is of course , even better than before . The acting in this movie in general was very very good . Great work with Michael's mask also , i think it will be my favorite now .
In the end , this movie delivers all it promises to deliver and it does all they said it will do , you will expect some things coming but you will also be often surprised . It's terrifying , intense , exciting , engaging . It captures the feeling from the original movie and it uses that very very well in most of the scenes .
And for a favorite scene from the movie , i'll chose the moment when Michael takes his mask back and puts it on . That moment was just incredible , you just know the evil is back and they won't get rid of the evil that easily 🎃

1087,peterskull,VERY STRANGE. Great movie with 1 BAD SCENE. A decent direct sequel to 78?,7,21 October 2018,"As the movie opens with the UNIVERSAL logos and so on, the eerie soundtrack by legendary John Carpenter begins. We are then introduced to the documentary team, 2 of them, and the inside of Smiths Grove sanitarium. The 2 are jumpy and worried. Feels like a quick version of the 'Once upon a time in the west' wait for Bronsons character to arrive, but in this case, we have glimpses of weird patients and guards going by day to day wondering. The fan spinning slowly with the great sound of bass waving with it. We are then introduced to this ''new Loomis'' psychiatrist with familiar moustache and voice. He describes to the documentary team how obsessed he is with the Michael Myers case. The psychiatrist then brings the 2 out into the court, which looks like a chess board, out in the open. But instead of chess pieces, there are crazed inmates surrounding this statue like figure with a damaged eye, which is actually Michael, now aged 61. The British documentary guy goes up to the silent man who is chained and unable to move out of the yellow square. The British man then pulls out a decayed mask in which, he knows, will provoke Michael. He then is allowed to provoke Michael even more by shouting ''SAY SOMETHING'' multiple times, which also disturbs the other inmates which causes them to react by screaming and barking. The camera zooms in to Michael from all different angles while the British man is still shouting ''SAY SOMETHING''. It then cuts on to a black screen with the ORIGINAL FONT of the 78 Halloween title, while blasting John Carpenters EXCELLENT SCORE, it then cuts to a decayed pumpkin which begins to inflate like a balloon, resembling Michael getting out of the catatonic state and wanting to go on a killing spree for a last time.The movie is worth going to see just for the amazing opening and soundtrack. Does the movie live up to the opening? Mostly.Michael Myers in this movie is very different from every Michael we have seen in previous movies, and YES, he his different from the original. He has become more evil than he was in 78, he doesn't care who he murders. In the original he only wanted to kill people around Laurie. Of course he killed the mechanic to don the outfit, but mainly he had a fixation around Laurie and her friends. Mainly because they lived near his area. Laurie was the one who came right up to his house, which obviously set an image into his head which reminded him of another teenage girl he previously murdered in that house, which was his sister. But of course, Laurie only resembles, not actually related. He's also fixated on Laurie and the others because of the driving past situation. Who knows really? But in this movie he seems to be slaughtering the neighbourhood one by one, mirroring what Sheriff Bracket said in the first about all the families being set up as a slaughterhouse. Back to Michael, he seems more stumpy and not relaxed like in 78. Maybe that is a good thing, as he was stabbed and shot by Laurie and Loomis.The movie was very decent all the way until this psychiatrist turns up again. We presume, even by Laurie, that he is the ''new Loomis''. But it turns out, he is not. More of a dark, messed up version. As we see him in the car with Lauries Granddaughter, and a cop. The psychiatrist warns the girl to watch out as the cop slowly drives down the street, trying to find Michael as he escaped the bloodbath in the neighbourhood. They then come across Michael and the cop proceeds and runs over Michael. Both the cop and psychiatrist get out the car and then this is where things become very weird. The psychiatrist then starts caressing Michaels mask and says he is dead. The cops then tries to shoot Michaels ''dead'' body in the face and the psychiatrist, out of nowhere, stabs the cop in the neck, kills him. We then see from the girls perspective, as she is locked in the back of the cop car, of course. Out of nowhere the psychiatrist pops up wearing the mask and the cop coat, looking pretty pathetic. While very eerie and weird, he somehow picks Michael or drags him into the back of the car, and sits him next to the girl as she is screaming. The psychiatrist then starts blabbering about how he wants Michael to stay alive just to study on him more. And then continues to talk about how he wants him to talk. Of course he is stupidly seduced by the girls lie ''He spoke to me, let me out''. Michael wakes up, puts the mask back on, then kills the psychiatrist in a Rob Zombie manner, stomping on his head.That scene really bugged me. Is it written badly or is it just me? I have heard many reviewers and Youtube critics criticise the same scene. Dave Mcrae and Chris Stuckmann.. and many other twitter critics.Overall, I really liked the movie apart from that scene. It's a shame because I waited nearly 2 years for this. I did watch this on the first day but I was confused for a few days on whether I liked it or not. I love the soundtrack I love every scene with Jamie Lee Curtis. I love Myers, even if he doesn't walk like Nick Castle in the first. It's a shame the documentary team was killed off, especially the girl. It would've been good to see Cops and others criticise her for provoking Michael. I didn't mind the ending either. I give it a 7/10. I hope I like it more on a 2nd viewing. I am a big fan on the original Halloween, I've seen it too many times, over 100 times. I wasn't a fan of Halloween 2 1981 either. Mainly because of the bad continuity with the look and the directing, editing and so on.
My favourite Halloweens are:

1094,thering-97827,It doesn't feel like halloween,5,4 August 2019,"This movie is unfortunately the victim of being a slasher movie in 2018. The original movie is cited as being an effectively suspenseful horror film and fully bringing the slasher sub-genre into the mainstream.Halloween 2018 is all around a fun movie but the suspense aspect of it seems to be lacking. There was a substantial lack of true suspense in this movie. A scene where Micheal Myers is standing over the baby hinted at something horrific, but I can only image that the film makers believed killing a baby was too far. Why even tease the idea?At one point before the climax of the film there is a twist that absolutely broke my faith in this movie. The shot of the Doctor with the Mask on absolutely ruined the momentum the movie was beginning to have.The comedy in this movie between the the baby sitter and the child felt natural and well done. I cannot say the same for other comedic relief characters who are either not funny, uncomfortable, or out of place. Especially the scene with the two cops in their car after Allyson and Michael were captured by the Doctor.I appreciate the scene when Michael walks through Haddonfield on Halloween night which was a long one shot which recaptured the directing style of the first movie. You could tell they put time and effort into the lighting movement and composition of the shot. One of the good reminders this is in the same franchise of that first 1978 film. Another of my favorite parts of the movie is when Michael placed a dead body under a Sheet like a ghost. It really reminded me of the original film. A lot of the kills I actually enjoyed especially ones that happened in the background or dead bodies people found. I just wish there was more of that in this movie.The criticism that this movie is either not graphic enough or too graphic to the point where Michael feels like Jason Vorhees I disagree with. Micheal choked and stabbed most of his victims in the original movie silently with little blood, which he then would display their bodies for Laurie to see. If you believe this movie needed more violence or disturbing content then I may ask you to re-watch the original movie to see what really made it work.I wouldn't watch this again unprompted but it is something I would watch at a party or with friends.",Halloween
1095,wigoqv,Probably one of the Best Halloween movies,7,14 April 2019,"I was super happy and hyped when I found out that Halloween was gonna get a reboot sequel, Since every sequel in The series pretty much sucked I was really hoping that it would be good. And luckily it was a pretty badass sequel! Definitely not better than the original, but it still delivers some fine kills and horror. If you have a chance to see this movie, you should definitely take that chance if you want to see a badass, scary and violent slasher film. 7,5/10",Halloween
1096,tommyinferno,A promising look at the future of the series!,7,7 May 2019,"Before I had seen Halloween (2018) I had heard great things and was really looking forward to watching the movie. Halloween delivers a great sequel with great characters, a good story and plenty of gruesome kills. Halloween is a direct sequel to John Carpenter's original movie, so starting this movie you don't need to have watched any of the movies apart from the original, although they explain the events of the original during the new movie (but as a die hard Halloween fan I highly recommend watching the whole franchise). Halloween was released and takes place 40 years after the original where Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode and seems more comfortable in the role than ever. She is supported by a great cast including her granddaughter, daughter and Sheriff Brackett, who also makes a return from the original. During the movie the characters portray their characters really well, especially Jaime who does a fantastic job at showing us how the events of the first Halloween has affected her character and she wants nothing more than to kill Michael and finally settle down. This brings us on to the star of the show Michael Myers, the sadistic killer who returns to wreak havoc on Haddonfield. Nick Castle returns as Michael Myers and does another phenomal job at portraying the killer, he has perfected Michael's blank expressions, movements and everything else that makes Michael Myers who he is. To sum it all up, as a die hard Halloween and slashers in general fan, this is a great sequel I highly recommend this movie to any horror fan and it's a promising look at the future for Halloween . It's a good idea to watch the original Halloween first but it's not a necessity. 7/10",Halloween
1097,dr-achris,Another addition in a stale franchise,4,13 October 2020,"The new ""Halloween"" installment was entitled as a sequel which goes straight back to the original, although David Gordon Green just used original Halloween's storyline without any new ideas or inspiration at all: Myers escapes while being transferred, returns to his hometown on Halloween night, starts killing babysitters and their boyfriends, then confronts Laurie (but no one knows why?). Fatally wounded but not dead, his breathing can be heard in credits (sequel alert). The only i can keep is some scenes of pure horror and a very good performance from Jamie Lee Curtis.
But there is nothing more to surprise you in this movie, every one knows the ending before it begins. The same scenario over and over again, ""Immortal psychopath who never be killed by anybody (police, doctors or potential victims)"" has been reproduced dozens of times all these years and not all of them were successful.

Halloween 2018 is one of the better Halloween movies that I have seen. It was a huge burst of nostalgia having Carpenter behind the scenes, Jamie Lee Curtis back as the bad a** Laurie Strode and Nick Castle as the Shape. Both Michael and Laurie has a vengeance for the other and the 40 year old fight was on. Carpenter showed that Michael was still just as ruthless and psychotic as ever and that he would stop at nothing to get to Laurie and her family. That was especially shown when the father and son came up on the bus wreck and Michael left no survivors during that. I do believe that this is the first movie where Michael as a grown man kills an innocent child. That showed that he really was devoid of empathy and remorse. The reporters that was making the podcast believed that he possessed some human qualities and would have some sort of remorse for the deaths he committed in 78 and showing him the mask would tap into those emotions. Carpenter showed us that Michael is truly an evil being and will stop at nothing to kill someone",Halloween

Resurrection was just bad, I still love the 1st Rob Zombie Halloween, though I think giving Michael Meyers a backstory to explain why he is the way he is was a mistake, it takes away from the character. Didn't care for 2nd Rob Zombie outing. I am glad this new movie wipes away all the sequels and is a direct follow up to the 1978 version! It takes Michael back to just being terrifying, there is no reasoning why he does what he does, you don't know his motivation or his triggers, he's the boogeyman, you're not supposed to know that. I think Laurie was handled very well as what a survivor may go through and her transformation. I really enjoyed this movie, and hope this will bring the franchise to a close.",Halloween

It had its parts but overall they could've done better but how can they when there is so many of them? Here are a few good/bad scenes that I noticed from the movie....1) Good: The 3rd person Michael scene. It just shows you how he is a killing machine and just purely and simply.....evil.2) Bad: Back of the cop car scene. So the granddaughter of Laurie is sharing the back seat with Michael when he is ""knocked out"" and when he comes out of it, he doesn't kill her? But instead he kills the doctor driving?4) Good: The backyard scene. This is a classic Halloween scene. Michael is lurking in the shadow stalking his victim and has that suspense like the original had.5) Bad: The trailers. Now this had nothing to do with the overall rating of the movie but the trailers and tv spots ruined this movie. You knew what was coming.

It doesn't beat the original, nor was it really trying to.It's 10/31, there's babysitters and teenagers, the cover of night, and Michael Myers is on the loose again. The formula is similar, but still different enough to feel somewhat fresh.The gore does not disappoint with some creative kills and plenty of blood.Most of the characters serve some purpose to move the story along, whether it's to stop Michael or point him to the inevitable, but largely predictable, final confrontation.There is a scene that I thought was really cool with how the lights and shadows move when Michael enters a random house through the side. His shadow moves up the wall as he disappears, only to reappear behind the woman. I'm sure you can guess what happens next...My biggest complaint would be the waste of screen time that is known as Ray Nelson, the cringey annoying husband and father.

1120,lpbott-102-817827,Decent but could have been better,7,22 October 2018,"Jamie Lee was fantastic!!
The movie was decent but padded in areas that it didn't need to be which left out areas where story needed to be.
1st: Where the man and his son discover the crashed bus, the was a 5 min conversation between them on how dancing was the son's thing. I know it's supposed to be just idle chit chat, but it was focused on way to long.
2nd : Allyson's friends' side story had no real connection to the movie plot, it felt like oh the original had a babysitter too.You didn't know her friend was babysitting until she was til she was. Then she was, and there little boy was great but what happen to him?
3rd: Karen Strode this was such a missed oppurtunity. I know they were going from being raised by a prepper to Super domestic. However there where no hints that she held on to this until the end, and very little backstory minus a 5 minute montage.
4th: Allyson's boyfriend what was the point?
5th: Karen's husband again what was the point
6th: The doctor's twist i really wish they had hinted at this a little more, heck focus on this plot and do away with the british documentarians.
Things that were fantastic.
Again Jamie Lee!
The action scenes were fantastic.
Judy Greer, while her story line was wasted she was great especially the last 15 minutes.
The look of the movie definitely had the feel of the original.
The little boy being babysat.
The homages to the original movies. From Allyson's shirt in her Clyde costume ( very reminscent of Laurie's from the orginal. The mask from Halloween 3. PJ Soles cameo. The dollhouse that looked very similar to the original Myer's house. The fact that they filmed it in spring/summer so there were all these dead leaves on the grown while the trees werw full of green leaves ( like the original).

1122,26obiht-c,Movie was not bad but not great either,6,21 October 2018,"The movie was not all that entertaining, which is the part that is supposed to score the highest on horror movies. Couple of scares here and there but not that many. The plot itself is very basic, but is in general more logical than most horror movies. There was a good plot twist, which gives the movie points (when the professor murdered the cop instead of Michael). The intrigue also adds a couple points because we still have a few questions once the movie is over (for example, is Michael really dead?). The acting was not bad and the graphics were all right as well.To conclude, the movie didn't have many flaws, but didn't have anything outstanding either. I give it the passing grade for that reason, but nothing more. The biggest flaw in the movie was the fact that it lacked thrilling action. You are not supposed to yawn during those types of movies, especially at the movie theatre, but it was the case here. It was good cinematography for a horror flick, but a bad entertainment factor for a horror flick. Had it been more terrifying, it would have been a 7.",Halloween

The film I thought took more of a look at Laurie Strode and how as a survivor and victim she has been affected and how her family has coped with her.

1134,bobbygyorfi,"Good movie, a bit overhyped",7,22 October 2018,"I'll preface this by saying I've seen the original Halloween and Halloween II at least 15-20 times, Halloween 4, 5 and H20 a solid 10 times, and the remaining three movies maybe 3 or 4 times each (not counting the Rob Zombie remakes, I haven't bothered to watch those). Everything I read was that if you're a fan of the original 1978 film that you will love this one. I have to say I was slightly disappointed. It wasn't a terrible movie at all, and judging it by itself it was actually pretty solid. But compared to the original, it just didn't have the same feel, despite John Carpenter being involved and some of the original actors (Laurie and Michael) reprising their roles. It didn't help that almost every jump-scare and kill was given away in the previews.One of the things I really wanted the film to address was how Michael got caught after Loomis shot him off of the balcony in the orginal film. Instead, all they say is that he has been in the asylum for the past 40 years, ever since that night. I am assuming that they are pretending as if that scene didn't happen, and they just took him into custody after Loomis shot him.They further clarify the timeline for us early in the movie by saying that Laurie and Michael being related was just a myth, confirming that every movie after the original did not happen. I didn't really have an issue with the whole ""Michael wants to kill his entire family"" story-line that the other movies present, it was really just the whole ""Michael is cursed"" stuff that they bring into the later movies that I thought was ridiculous. However, in the original story-line, Laurie endures the trauma of the original film's events as well as those in Halloween II. Then she fakes her own death, but her daughter Jamie becomes the target in Halloween 4, 5, and 6 (at least early on in 6). I don't think they ever address this in H20 (that Laurie's daughter was killed), but that, along with the events of H20, would be enough to drive Laurie insane and have a desire to kill this psycho. But in this new timeline, Laurie had to endure Michael's murder-spree of 1978, but that's it. Is that enough to make her build a safe-house and have a desire for Michael to escape so that she can kill him 40 years later? And is Michael not killing Laurie in 1978 enough to drive him to find her 40 years later to finish the job?The film starts by introducing the British investigative journalists who want to get to know Michael. I had no issues with these two, and the scenes they were in were pretty good. The only odd thing was Michael's doctor allowing the guy to basically shout at Michael while holding his old mask in front of him, getting the other patients completely riled up as if there was a full moon. The scene at the gas station was very similar to the ""he-escaped"" scene in Halloween 4. Michael switches out his patient gown for a jump suit that he takes from a mechanic that he kills, and then proceeds to kill both of the journalists (who just so happen to be at the same gas station). This entire scene was basically given away in the previews, so no surprise here that they both were killed.Up to this point, they were showing Michael from the side and back a lot. I can't remember if it was here or later in the movie, but they do show that he is missing his left eye, which is the one Laurie stabbed 40 years earlier. This shows that he is not super-human like the other movies indicate (Laurie stabs his eye in the original and then shoots out both of his eyes in Halloween II, but then by Halloween 4 he is fine and can see again...). They were making it seem like Michael was actually going to say something at some point in the movie, but I am so glad that he didn't. That would've been the biggest bummer ever, and I probably would've taken off four stars in the review just for that. The scene where the doctor kills the sheriff just to protect Michael reminded me of Dr. Wynn's character in Halloween 6, and I was worried where they were planning on taking it from there. The guy had a very unhealthy obsession with trying to get Michael to talk. Also, when Michael regains consciousness in the back seat, why wouldn't he have killed Laurie's granddaughter right then? Instead, he focuses on the doctor, and even gets out of the car to finish him off, allowing the granddaughter to escape. And, slightly off topic here, the granddaughter's boyfriend either was never killed or I don't remember him being killed. They set up the story for the jack@$! boyfriend to be killed, but then he never was.Some of the humor in the film was good, but a lot seemed unnecessary. The first interaction with the father was ridiculous, with him saying that the mouse-trap peanut butter got on his penis, directly in front of his 17-year old daughter. From the time he was introduced, I not only knew that they were going to kill him off, but I was glad that they would.There were plenty of nods to the previous films in the franchise, even if they had been nixed from the timeline. As mentioned above, they debunk the ""Laurie is related to Michael"" plot, and the gas station scene of Halloween 4 was similar to one in this film. (1) The new group of teenagers is basically the same as Laurie, Lynda, Annie, and Bob. The blonde babysitter (essentially Lynda) is killed and placed under a sheet like a ghost, just like how Michael wears the sheet and strangles Lynda in the original. Then her boyfriend (basically Bob) is stabbed to the wall so that his feet are off of the floor, just like Bob. They don't actually show him getting killed, though, which was kind of a bummer. It's not like they were afraid of being too gory based on a few other deaths, but I guess they didn't want to copy the original too much. (2) They also have another classroom scene where one of the main female leads is learning about fate and longingly glances out the window only to see someone staring back. In the original, Laurie sees Michael by the car, in H20 Laurie's son's girlfriend sees Michael by the gate, and in this one, Laurie's granddaughter sees Laurie. Fun fact, the teacher in this scene is the same actress who played Lynda in the original, though they don't even show her face. (3) The scene where the sheriff runs over Michael in the car and then the doctor goes over to his body only to turn around and kill the sheriff with the scalpel is somewhat similar to a scene in Halloween II, except backwards actually. There, Loomis (the doctor) shoots Michael, and then the officer goes over to his body to check on him. Loomis tells the officer to get away (just like the sheriff tells the doctor in this one), and then Michael kills the officer with the scalpel. (4) Another scene...Michael grabs a hammer from the garage and kills an elderly woman with curlers in her hair and then steals her knife. Similar thing happens in the first five minutes of Halloween II.Despite Michael being played by the same guy who played him 40 years ago, he just didn't have the same feel. Still creepy as hell, and still walks slowly (not as slow as in Halloween II), but just something about it didn't feel as scary. And that goes for the whole movie in general, really. The original movie gave me nightmares as a kid, but this one just didn't have that terrifying feel to it (granted, I am significantly older). The soundtrack was similar, but they made it more electronic and added a few variations that made it less scary, in my opinion. And I didn't see a single head-cock by Michael like he did when he killed Bob!Overall, it was a solid movie, it just didn't live up to the hype, in my opinion. The original is by far my favorite horror movie and is certainly in my top 10 for favorite movie of all time. I would actually put this new film behind the original, Halloween II, Halloween 4, and Halloween H20 in my ranking of the Halloween movies. Definitely significantly better than Curse and Resurrection, and I would imagine it's a million times better than the Rob Zombie remakes (never saw them, but I've heard enough about them to not want to see them). I doubt that Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle would come back for another movie, but despite the house burning down, they never actually showed Michael burning/dying. And I mean, without adding some sort of twist, the guy is already 61 years old, at some point the fear-factor is lost if a 70 year old is chasing teenagers around to kill them. Wouldn't be surprised if the granddaughter becomes the new female lead in any future movies, though.",Halloween
1135,anythinkfilms,Halloween,9,18 December 2018,"*SPOILERS*
Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis): He is a killer. But he will be killed tonight.
Halloween (2018) was an unexpected hit, I went into the cinema with low expectations due to the previous instalments which for me destroyed this franchise created by horror mastermind John Carpenter those forty years ago.
Fortunately David Gordon Green (known for Joe (2013), Stronger (2017) and Pineapple Express (2008)) done a great job in bringing back this franchise to be the intensely driven film it was intended to be. Then you've got a script by Danny McBride, the guy who's always playing the silly or humorous character, this just like 'Get Out (2017)' shows you that when people go out there comfort zones they can make great products.
Much like a lot of reboots (and sequels) that have come out in recent months there has been a lot of references to the previous films which was nice to see as story wise it didn't acknowledge the previous stories but it gave a nod to most of them.
Throughout this film there's a lot of good shooting - the lighting is incredible, there's good use of shadows. There's even a long single take (I love my good long takes) which you can see the start of here(this scene is also a reference to Halloween 2 (1981)-The film begins at the Smiths Grove sanatorium where Michael has been imprisoned, a couple of true crime enthusiasts go there to try and confront Michael and see if he'll talk but he doesn't. They also meet the Dr Loomis of this film Dr Sartain who just comes across as your average Psychiatrist at this point.
When Michael doesn't speak it motivates the enthusiasts to go and visit Laurie Strode in her isolated estate where she has an armoury, booby traps and some amazing lighting. But again this doesn't really go their way in terms of getting a lot of info, even when they bribe her.In terms of storyline it was fairly linear and not convulted, there was a simple amount of characters with pretty good development from start to finish, yeah some of the characters were fairly cliched but its the acting, directing and dialogue that made it better.Bonnie and Clyde role reversal
There's a theme throughout the film - role reversal and it starts of with Andi Matichak alongside her boyfriend in the film Dylan Arnold switching the gender roles of Bonnie and Clyde.
Throughout the film the others are including references from previous films like:I can't remember which film but in this one it's the girlfriend thats under the sheets and in the other film it's the boyfriend.
The psychiatrist Dr Loomis helps the good guys but in this one Dr Sartain helps Michael. Michael is being hunted by Laurie Strode where as previously she was hunted. There's a great scene at her house where Laurie is thrown out the window like Michael was and he looks out after being distracted and her body has gone (sound familiar).
Even the ending, the house was in the middle of nowhere so that Michael could one day be lead there to die and that's what Laurie does, then traps him and lights the place on fire. But is Michael really dead? I think no because I believe Michael is an idea a shape (film reference) and if people still remember him or know him then he's not going anywhere, anytime soon!
I'd also like to say John Carpenter's music in this was highly appreciated and helped make the film what it is, it wouldn't have been as good without the master himself being on board.9/10",Halloween
1136,Slobberman,Just an average horror movie.,5,9 November 2018,"My biggest problem with the new Halloween is the amount of so-called references to earlier installments of the franchise, especially to the original from '78. There is a thin line between paying homage to another movie and imitating another movie, and Halloween (2018) crossed this line. I can understand that the 'references' to the original are like a fan-service, but certain scenes are just copied in such a way that it is starting to look more like laziness from the filmmakers. And there are loads of examples: Laurie standing outside the school, looking at her granddaughter and disappearing when she looks away. Laurie being pushed out of the window by Michael and disappearing from the ground when Michael looks away. The kid getting pierced on the wall by a knife. The escaped insane prisoners walking around in white overalls. Etcetera.And it's a shame, because the movie starts promising with Michael murdering a child, which makes you think that everything is possible in this film. However, it doesn't take long for it to get right back on the predictable horror track. Furthermore, I did not find the movie scary. Except for one or two scenes, there was very little tension. At times I even found it boring. Not to mention the unbelievable and far-fetched plot-twist, which only exists to have a final confrontation between Michael and Laurie.Fortunately there are a couple of positives. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning. Carpenter really outdid himself. The long take with Michael going from house to house, murdering its inhabitants was beautifully shot (that's how you do an homage!). I also think they did a great job showing the impact of the events from 40 years ago on Laurie's character.All in all Halloween (2018) is a completely average movie, which might even be a compliment for the Halloween franchise.",Halloween

1138,bammyjastard,"I wasn't disappointed, great film!",9,25 August 2019,"As a massive Halloween fan, i was thrilled when they announced a sequel in 2018. To be honest i wasn't disappointed.
We are told to ignore all other sequels...thank god, as some of the previous attempts have been utter garbage....anyone remember Halloween Resurrection?!
This is now 40 years to the day after the original Halloween and Michael has been incarcerated for those 40 years after being captured that night in 1978. I'm unsure why they would want to transfer him to another mental institution after this huge amount of time, but i suppose the story has to give him the opportunity to escape somehow.
The acting is superb throughout and the plot has some great ideas. I absolutely love the fact that there are so many references to all the other Halloween films.
The only small disappointment for me (and it is only small ) was that they showed Michael's face too much. The 2 things we all know about Michael is that he doesn't speak, ever and we don't see his face (apart from the 6 year old child standing out front holding the knife in 1978) so i was a little disappointed with the way some scenes were shot.
Overall...9/10",Halloween

1145,TateJ3rd,Wanted to like it but...,3,19 October 2018,"Wasn't scary, don't think they even tried to make it scary as they showed damn near every ""jump scare"" in the trailers and tv commercials. There are a couple of moments that are supposed to be funny thrown in that made me sigh. This is a horror movie about a masked man going around killing, nothing should be funny here but that's just my take. It takes awhile to get going. I enjoyed the two reporters trying to get Michael to talk and following Laurie's relationship with her family and her struggles with PTS but it was like get to the point already after awhile.People are very, very dumb in this. Like, ""there is a bus crashed off on the side of the road and mental patients wondering the street!"". ""Let me leave my child in the car while I investigate"". Or ""I know we are hiding underneath a kitchen counter/trap door in the kitchen and Michael won't likely find us but let me make as much noise as possible with my crying to help him find us"". Or ""I am a lady in the ladies room using the bathroom but why is this strange man in a jump suit and steel boots in here""? ""And why is he opening every stall door?"" ""When he gets to mine I'll just tell him it's occupied"" ""Wait he won't leave...now he's just standing here, OH MY GOD TEETH!"" And the list goes on.I had high expectations (I don't know why). Jamie Lee Curtis did a good job I thought. As for Michael, this is a nitpick but he's unmasked a little too much for my liking. They never fully show his face but you see him from behind and from the side and he's an old, balding, white male with white hair. I kept expecting him to turn around and it actually be Richard Dreyfuss. The movements weren't Michael like, he moved almost like a robot or like someone was controlling him with a PS4 controller or something.I just wish the movie would have been a little better. Especially when Michael finally returns to Haddonfield. It should have really picked up there but unfortunately the movie went down with lame kills, unwanted comedy, and the movie actually being edited badly. There is a scene where Michael is struck with a cop car and it is shot so badly. I hate to nitpick on something like that but it was so bad and obvious. The ending was flat and it was clear that the directors didn't want to kill Michael off because they want to make another one. If this guy traumatized you that bad, why wouldn't you make sure he was dead for sure. Why catch him on fire (they never show Michael actually being on fire) instead of shooting him in the head? He was standing right there?I like the Halloween movies and hoped this would set them on a new better path but it might be time to FINALLY just let these movies and the Michael character be because this wasn't it.",Halloween

1147,austin-night,3/10 review vs. 7/10 review. For those who have seen it.,7,20 October 2018,"3/10 review1. Characters are introduced as a mainstay then just simply vanish from script (boyfriend should have been killed.)2. New Doctor is not a worthy character, maybe not cast right or maybe the character should have been omitted; not sure on this one.3.If Michael caused the bus crash as was stated in the film, that scene should have been included and could have been BADASS. (maybe a directors cut?)4.Laurie Strode has been training for 40 years to kill Michael, building a fortress of complete protection for her and her loved ones, full of secret rooms filled with unlimited guns and ammo to kill Michael. Every room has a locking cage mechanism to trap Michael. Again, she's planned for this, knowing it was going to happen, for 40 years. Yet she allows her son-in-law to foolishly get killed by Michael at the most important moment in her life??? WTF? Also the ""death"" of Michael was obviously an attempt at hinting at a sequel, which I get if you're looking to make more money, but it just doesn't make sense. Laurie's entire existence has been to kill Michael Meyers and when she finally has the chance to do it she just walks off and assumes he's dead?? DUMB.5. As a child of the 80's, I appreciate horror movies and the gore that came with them. Thing is, the original Halloween didn't have much gore and was pretty, pretty, pretty, scary without it. This 2018 movie used more gore than was necessary in my opinion (and I love The Walking Dead.) Sure, a little more blood this go around is cool but taking it to the Rob Zombie level (his movie sucked BTW) was just not needed.7/10 Review:1. Good stuff. Opening sequence was AWESOME. Felt like I was in a 1978 movie theater watching the original which was super cool.2. I've watched Halloween every Halloween for 25 years and can get scared every time. I've also watched all of Danny McBride's work from the Foot Fist Way to Vice Principles and love them all, so was pretty excited to find out that Danny was scripting a new Halloween. Credit is due and I appreciate his admiration. If he and his BFF want to do a second (3rd?) Halloween I'm all in.3. It is truly scary! If Michael Meyers scares you in the slightest way then this movie will scare you. It has some seriously intense scenes. I really like the idea of MM just walking through a neighborhood and killing random people. That was the PERFECT way to remind the audience that Halloween is about a human who's only desire is to kill. And that is scary. Again, a little overkill on the gore.4. To sum up I'd say go see it if your a fan. You more likely to enjoy than not!",Halloween

It has the same old tired cliches and a laundry list of moronic characters up to and including Laurie Strode. The great plot twist everyone is talking about didn't even make sense. Also everyone is saying Laurie messed Michael up in the finale. From my point of view she got her ass handed to her. The movie leads you to believe she has been preparing to trap and kill him all this time. She chooses the worst weapon for close quarters inside the house and turns off all the lights so she cannot see without a flashlight. The part that really ticks me off is that she set booby traps to seal off each room after she clears it. Why not just seal all the rooms after he gets in the house? After that she would be safe and can dispose of him at will. No no she has to get him in the basement then burn the whole damned house down haha. If the basement would have been fortified I would buy it but it is not! We never see a body or Michael even being lit on fire so I guarantee he got out. She literally chopped his head clean off in H20 but now we are to believe this fire will stop him before he breaks through the floorboards and escapes? I say BOO...not intended as a pun but as a discription of this movie. I wonder if the ambiuous ending means that we will get H60 in 2038, at least that one may be entertaining. Michael can break out of his nursing home and track Laurie down in a wheelchair...all of the houses in Haddonfield are handicap accessible so he can rack up his body count hehehe. Just stop already!

All the hype around its release, with the ""final showdown"" talk, led you to think this would be the final Halloween. Wrong. And this movie was all over the place, wanting to be so many different things. So many questions with this movie. We're ignoring the sequels...but we're going to literally steal/remake scenes from them? I can count several off the top of my head. Mrs Elrod making the sandwich from part 2, the ambulance crash (now bus) from part 4, the woman in the restroom from H20, even the violent smackdown in the restroom from Rob Zombie's remake. Now, Laurie...she's agoraphobic but you can't keep her in her house on the very day that traumatized her. Standing in the exact same spot she first saw Michael...hanging out in the schoolyard with her grand daughter...going to a restaurant...going to the gas station to see the carnage that the very guy that caused her all this pain has left a path of death...on & on. If we're ignoring the sequels, why all the fascination from everyone with Michael, and why Laurie's over the top trauma? If we're ignoring the sequels, then he basically was just a man that killed a couple of people...happens every day but we don't see this kind of reaction. And the reporter trying to work him up at the beginning with the mask...""It's a part of you..you feel it""...no, it was a random mask he took from a hardware store 40 years ago and wore it, like, five hours one night. Then Laurie's house...it's never mentioned she has a job, yet she has her house rigged up like something from a Saw movie. Where did she get all this stuff, and who installed it? Home Depot? Geek Squad? Did Laurie go to tech school to learn this stuff, even running natural gas lines?

1159,joshlogiudice,"Halloween aims for a lot, but misses far too much",5,4 November 2018,"As many other reviews have stated, this movie tried to be too many things, and ultimately didn't succeed in any of them. There were so many useless characters that had no development so we had no empathy towards them. Unlike the original Halloween movie, I can't remember most of the death scenes in this new movie. That's because they're all rushed and there is no tension. At no point during the movie do you think to yourself ""oh no get out of there"". Michael just shows up behind someone quickly and stabs them and walks away.
Another problem I have with this movie is basically everything.
If Laurie strode is really this traumatized by all the horrors in the world, why would she have a child? Throughout the movie they emphasize how Laurie trained her daughter to be ready for the horrors of the world (Michael Meyers) but wouldn't the easiest way to do this be to not have a child at all? There are just too many logic problems to begin to discuss with this film.
The twist towards the end with the new doctor? Dumb and unnecessary, what purpose does he play? He wants to see Michael out in the wild killing people so he gets him to escape, but how much of michaels killing does this doctor witness? It seems like none. So what's the point? Why does the doctor wait until now to decide he wants to feel what it feels to kill someone.
There are many nods to the original movies throughout the film, so much that it starts to feel like a remake more than a sequal. Laurie's granddaughter walking down the street with her two friends, her sitting in class looking outside like Laurie did, but instead of seeing Michael appear and disappear it's laurie herself. It came off more as cheap than admiring. Also, why does Michael return to haddonfield in the first place? When the bus crashed he could go anywhere he wanted. Did he specifically come back for Laurie? I like to think not, as there is no real reason he should as Laurie was just a random victim back in the original. If Michael came back to kill Laurie that contradicts the whole theology of michael Meyers, as this would show he is looking for revenge, which is something humans desire and that is not what Michael Meyers is, he is just the shape.All in all this movies a disappointment, there were a couple decent kill scenes and somewhat suspense in the beginning, but this is definitely not the greatest Halloween sequel.",Halloween

I'll keep this brief.
1. Michael is too tall (again)
2. The mask isn't good (again)
3. Why copy ideas from Rob Zombies movies?
4. What's with the loud clumpy boots? Michael should be stealthy.
5. Where did the kid go? He was shaping up to be a great character then disappeared.
6. Why is Albert Einstein Michaels new doctor?
7. Why bang on about ""returning to the original in basic style and music"" then use updated electrified soundtrack which has destroyed the claustrophobia of the original score since Halloween II?
8. Inflating pumpkin? Just nope.
9. Annoying English journalists were annoying.
10. 40 years prep and still made a pigs eat of it? I could practice something for about 4 hours and pretty much nail it.
11. If the 40 years prep was all about prep, why keep the true intention of the cellar a secret from the granddaughter till the last minute?
12. Laurie outside the school a la Original movie- no.
13. Laurie disappears after fall from window a la original movie - no.
14. As much as I love the idea of them not being brother and sister, why come back for her? The first movie's basis of terror was the sheer randomness of who he chose to stalk.
15. Michael is 'the shape', there was far too much screen time of him just pondering what to do next, only thing missing was a few head and chin scratches.
16. Far too many jump scares and none of them hit their mark.
17. Michael discovering the secret bunker was too much like a rip off of the ending of One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest.
18. I might have missed it but there was no explanation of how they recaught Michael after the first movie.
19. Not enough of a tribute to dr Loomis.
20. Loved the use of the original font for the titles but they ruined it by running them too fast (and that god-awful inflating pumpkin).
21. Complete lack of suspense.
22. No Myers house? Unless I missed it.
23. What was the point of the dolls house in the design of the Doyle house?
24. Crappy ambiguous ending.",Halloween

Unlike the 1978 predecessor, or Halloween II, this sequel is never scary. In fact, it's abundantly preposterous.The unintentionally hilarious tone is set right at the start with an opening scene pitting Michael Meyers against British true crime podcasters. That pop culture figures wield such journalistic authority is the perfect setup for a scene that left me belly laughing uncontrollably. Sadly, the film makers' intentions were entirely serious. Their attempts at deliberate humor are stunningly lame.Despite a ridiculous script, the cast are almost uniformly excellent, and it's a crime they should have to work so hard to validate some truly awful dialogue. Likewise the cinematography, editing and, of course, Carpenter's soundtrack are genuinely gorgeous. Sadly, they can't do much to uplift an overly long slasher film.In the end, we have a retcon vision of The Shape slicing his way through Haddonfield like an all-you-can-kill buffet, to face off against a Laurie Strode who's spent the last 40 years Sarah Connor Finishing School.

1166,tdmartinez-74233,Finally a brilliant sequel to the franchise.,10,20 October 2018,So glad we finally get a Halloween sequel from the last two decades that wasn't garbage. This movie took what John Carpenter did so well back in 1978 and made it a brilliant sequel. It actually wanted to develop a story not just see how gross of special effects they can make like Rob Zombies versions.,Halloween
1167,JoshBertie,This is how it's done.,8,22 October 2018,"So to start off, if you're a fan of the first film and the whole slasher type genre then you're gonna enjoy this film a lot. As many of you know this film is a direct sequel to the first film and the first film alone and the plot is (without spoilers) that Michael Myers has been captured and held in a prison for roughly 40 years while Laurie Strode has been recovering mentally from what had happened on Halloween night 40 years prior to. Now to cut this review nice and short, this film is a great horror/thriller/slasher movie but why is that? Well first of all it takes all the iconic scenes and stereotypes not only from Halloween but from them classic horror flicks, for example the font and the title sequence is almost identical to that of its original right down to how grainy and d the font and screen looks. Now what makes this film such a great horror film is that it builds suspense almost throughout the whole second half (Not long after he obtains his mask back) and it does this by NOT doing everything horror films are doing in this day and age which is forcing a jump scare upon its viewer, for example The Nun was horrific, it had no plot, not characters that were interesting and most of all it tried to force jump scares every 2 minutes so it becomes boring and obvious. Now Halloween 2018 builds this amazing yet scary suspense by almost recreating classic horror scenes such as not showing you the deaths of some characters, if you literally go to watch people die constantly not only is that kind of creepy but you're missing the whole point of the film and it's story. By not showing you how the characters are killed off, not only is this a call back of sorts to its predecessor but it also gives you that creepy vibe and the fear of not knowing what happened that really gives you a scare. It's not gore porn (especially the first half) it's simple stabs, knocks and thuds but it's the way you don't see the character that really gives it that classic horror vibe which a lot of the Halloween sequels were missing, it's the reflection in windows, the heavy breathing and the slow yet somehow scary movements from this character that really shine and make you appreciate the first one all over again. When the second half does kick in and you get finally get some on-screen horrific kills which some gore it shocks you because for the first half you don't really get it so when you finally see this happen you get shocked which sets your scare meter off again so the film keeps giving throughout by constantly adding something that will keep you on the edge of you or seat wondering. What was also great about this film and if you're like me you'll hate this in other films but it's the fact that you hardly ever see Michael properly, and by properly I mean full focus JUST Michael. If you look at films like the Sinister films, the first was quite scary in my opinion because you don't really know what this thing is or looks like you just catch glimpses of it and then the sequel was the complete opposite and you constantly see the characters and children so you're therefore not as scared? Well this film does it in a great while that again calls back to the original, you see shots of Michael walking from a side angle or from behind but hardly ever see him full on so you're again in that fear of the unknown state of mind and that's what makes the jump scares when they do eventually pop up, even more terrifying. Unlike most horrors these days the first time you think you're gonna encounter a jump scare isn't actually a jump scare but more of a build up to a jump scare if you'd rather, and the film while do this quite a lot so you prepare yourself to be scared or jump and then it doesn't happen, rather it builds tension and carries on doing this throughout a scene and then it happens and you do genuinely have a bit of a jump which is another reason I loved this film. Overall I would highly recommend this film and it's a great direct sequel to the original and everything about it screams slasher.",Halloween
1168,acroyer,Boring Overly Gory Nonsense,6,20 October 2018,"I cannot believe after all the hulla-baloo from the producers claiming to bring the franchise back to basics, this is what they came up with.I could tell this was not going to be the case even before the main title popped on, after a ridiculous prologue at the mental ward with a pushy podcaster shouting at Michael to 'speak!' Then a visual flurry of editing with shots of mental patients looking mental. Then the title comes on with an explosion of sound. Yeah, I knew from there this was gonna be another modern, smash you over the head with sound and fury 'horror' movie.This film utterly lacks nuance and subtly to create any sense of atmosphere, dread or suspense. It only connects with the original movie through character banter and snarky dialogue.The only time this movie is engaging is with the kills which are loud, over the top and quite frankly, pornographic. I can't say that I particularly want to see a man's head explode in graphic detail after Michael stomps on it. I guess people really get off on this kind of yuck. Just because society claims audiences are desensitized to violence doesn't mean movies have to keep 'upping the ante.' However, I get the feeling the producers realized this is all the movie had going for it since it lacks anything else interesting like story, character or plot. It is a montage of characters who speak in that 2018 'oh so meta' way. Jamie Lee is wasted here.The whole movie really comes off as indulgent and obnoxious. Do we really REALLY need to have our ears explode with a jump scare sound effect? Every time Michael comes on the screen?! Can the camera please just stop moving or rotating? Can you please slow the editing down?The producers sold me on a minimalist, back to basics Halloween sequel then pulled a fast one, delivering dumb, boring schlock. They have no business discounting the FAR superior Halloween II, let alone the superior H20.My 3 stars is for the music by retired director John Carpenter, which was very good but doesn't fit the movie at all, even with the old cues throughout.Sigh. If you've been a fan since '78, this movie is going to be a major disappointment. I hated it.",Halloween

Played with some interesting themes including flipping certain themes and scenes from the classic playing on the idea of hunter and hunted (predator and prey) I recommend for any horror/slasher fan however I believe fans of the 1st will admire this more than the average cinema goer.

It's great that they've maintained a lot of the originality with the font of the credits & theme music.
For those who are new to the Halloween franchise, I think it's essential to watch at least the 1978 & 1981 films.
Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as ever. I would rank it 4 on the scarometer i.e. not scary. There is more blood and gore in this one & no nudity compared to the originals.A great finale to the Michael Myers saga.Can you actually kill the Bogeyman though?

(10/10 amazing film do watch)
the cinemas has had a mass shortage of slasher films and this brings them back with a bang everything about this movie was new and refreshing from the awesome soundtrack to the filming technique and story development I loved this movie and I am
Hopeful for an even better sequel
However no movie is extremely perfect I have made a little list of my personal pros and cons of this filmPROS
1. Good story
2. Good special effects
3. Love the twist and ending fight
4. Good soundtrack
5.good pacing for a return to Halloween film
6. Same vibe as original
7. Mask design was by far best one outCONS
1. Needs more character development so you really feel more when theese people die
2. Not a lot of kills where shown onscreen witch left this movie a little toned down to try and try and get a lower rating but man Halloween has always been an R rated franchise KEEP IT THAG WAY
3. A lot of the scary kills weren't shown
4. Some story lines went knowhere (hence high school ,you'll know what I mean)
5. Film could benefit from a more darker and menacing Michael at times this film felt aimed at a teenage audience I feel Halloween works best as an all out adult violent horror
That was pretty much my weigh up about it
Overall I enjoyed this movie a lot and can't wait for the sequel hoping for a more adult based violent return to haddenfield next time round",Halloween

1188,TribalWho,Once more with feeling,8,9 September 2018,"Seen at TIFF. Almost entire cast was there, inc. the Shape.Halloween returns for it's final chapter, and manages to deliver everything you'd expect from a Halloween sequel, and some things you won't see coming. The film opens with the documentary crew visiting Michael, a scene that's been covered quite extensively in the trailers. You'd expect things to go bad immediately but the film pulls back (not before the intro played, to Carpenter's wonderful score) to introduce its key players and gives them time to breath, setting up the status quo and making them more relatable. With three generations of Strodes to choose from, there's certainly something for everyone to be able to relate to. Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie has spent the last few decades getting ready to take Michael out, isolating herself and destroying all her relationships in the process. She has two failed marriages behind her and no relationship with her daughter. Only her granddaughter seems to pay any attention to her, as much as she can anyway, as she enters the movie in the throws of teenage romance, with all the angst and supporting characters such a romance requires. Throw in the Sherrif, Michael's doctor and the documentary crew in the mix, and the movie certainly does a great job of setting up a diverse buffet for Michael to slice and dice his way through. And that, he does. Boasting some truly memorable kills, Halloween does not hold back on the violence and gore, instead using it to build up dread throughout the movie. In fact, the whole film is an exercise in dread, slowly building up tension throughout its runtime and exploding into a glorious, bloody finale. While the films comes close to going off the rails trying to keep all its moving parts together (there's an odd subplot that pops up halfway through and one that I did not see coming, but never really goes anywhere and is STOMPED out pretty quickly), it manages to hold it all together and deliver a fantastic (hopefully) final entry in franchise, with some fist-pumping moments sure to be memorialized in pop-cult history. Excellent performances by Jamie Lee Curtis and Judy Greer. Some points to note: 
-There is a lot of Scream 4 in here. From self-aware teens to a toughened-up, table-turning protagonist. Not necessarily a bad thing.
-I thought this was a sequel to H1 and H2, but early on they make a point of saying Michael Meyers has killed 5 people - which could not include H2's body count? 
-It's a pleasure to see Michael Meyers finally cement his position as the Boogeyman of Haddonfield, part of it done during a wonderful long-take.",Halloween

1190,zacharyklozik,Simply Slashing,7,6 November 2019,"Halloween (2018) is a satisfying throwback to the classic slasher, that avoids falling into the overly cliché instances that have been carved by this subgenre of horror. It attempts to do a lot by revitalizing a series that has been in the coffin for years, pulling cast members of the original movie back into the light, and coating the film in a new flavor while also capturing the aftertaste left by Halloween (1978).Halloween (2018) avoids many of the major pitfalls of the numerous sequels and delivers with a movie that establishes a more sophisticated backdrop. The film takes a look at the subject of the psychological mindset of a crazed killer, as well as the implications of the mental status of a victim in these situations. The inclusion of these elements fleshes out the story in an interesting way, and it adds something new that was more or less overlooked in the original film.There is still, however, instances throughout the movie when we see humorous scenes that bring levity in between moments of terror. The balance between suspense and humor is constantly being measured in the film, and sometimes it works well, but there are times when its use feels messy. Often the injected humor that is sometimes seen in the film can be jarring and cause a loss of the tension that was being built by previous scenes.Halloween (2018) is a good slasher that does justice for the original movie. It has broken open a door to new elements that have not been seen in the many other iterations spawned by the 1978 film. The movie, overall, quenches the bloody thirst that is required in a film featuring Michael Myers and is worthy of a watch.",Halloween
1191,sharbelbdawalibi,Well Made With Some Flaws,5,4 November 2019,"Halloween directed by David Green is a very interesting film when compared to past iterations of Michael Myers. The film surprisingly had what I thought was a decently entertaining story line with the grandmother and her experiences. This film incorporated elements of scariness very well into the lives of the characters through Michael Myers. The film refrained from showing the emotions or physical characteristics of Michael which played very well into the horror aspect of the film. This film also portrayed violence in an entertaining way such as the bathroom kill scene where Michael murders the two reporters. The lighting was usually dark whenever Michael was out to kill which helped conceal his identity. The sound throughout the film was often non-diegetic in a sort of sound montage way that thus provided the viewer with emotional sound that played into the violence of Myers. I also noticed that whenever a hectic scene was taking place, there were more camera cuts that covered many angles, which I believe got the viewer into a more intimate connection with what was happening in the scene. A scene that incorporates these elements was the bus murder where Myers somehow breaks out of his restraints in the transport bus and kills the inmates. The setting was dark and Myers is able to kill the little boy who was searching for his father. The fact that it was merely a boy that was killed helps build up Myers evil character much more than if it was an adult who he is seen killing first. There were aspects of the film that I did not really enjoy. I thought it was strange that the reporters were able to taunt him with his own mask at the beginning of the film, especially when they knew that he was very dangerous. I also did not understand how Myers' tracking skills were so good throughout the film that he was able to find anyone so easily no matter how far they were or hidden they were. These kind of questions were too plentiful and thus I do not think this film deserves more than an average 5 star rating.",Halloween
1192,Rosebud_Sled,Commerce shall always triumph over cinematic legacy,5,3 November 2019,"...but lets face it, if I had the rights to this title I too would have succumbed; turn it into a franchise and milk it dry which is exactly what the owners of this property have done since the original came out and will continue to do so in the future.I've come to the conclusion that the original '78 was a happy accident that owes much of it's admirable qualities to the zeitgeist of the time which simply can't be replicated. The makers behind this entry are most likely aware of that (as is Carpenter) but didn't allow themselves to be deterred by that simple fact.The end result: an action film masquerading as a suspense thriller complete with typical Bourne Identity/Mission Impossible themed musical score along with the mandatory splash of hard rock. Excessive usage of bright police lights not only cause temporary blindness but take away from the precious few moments of dread the cinematography was able to capture during the evening neighborhood shots. Close-ups of contemporary mobile devices ensure this film will have a dated feel within a few years after release.It maybe the ""best"" sequel to a film that never needed one to began with but when the bar is set so low, it's really not saying much.",Halloween
1193,rickypop_uk,"A good effort, but...",6,9 November 2020,"Halloween (1978) is one of my favourite films and I believe that any sequel would need to have a lot going for it to top the original. But for the first twenty minutes or so, I thought this latest offering had done just that.Following the brief but effective opening sequence, fans of the original are greeted as if by an old familiar friend; the bright orange lettering, that classic theme tune playing over the credits while (in a touch I really loved) the image of a pumpkin rotting in reverse, as if mirroring the down-but-not-out Michael Myers regrouping after being institutionalised at Smith's Grove Psychiatric Hospital for 40 years following the events of the first film.A little after the 11 minute mark (after unbolting the door of her home/fortress) Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) makes her welcome appearance. Her tone towards her visitors Dana Haines and Aaron Korey (who are true crime journalists hoping for an interview) makes it immediately known that this is not the frightened young Laurie from 1978. This is a tougher, heavier drinking and much more guarded Laurie; forever scarred by her night of terror at the hands of Michael Myers, seemingly just biding her time until their next encounter. A scene not long after this shows Laurie blasting away at several mannequins with a shotgun and then (whilst donning the requisite action hero vest) racking/prepping an array of guns looking more like Sarah Connor in Terminator 2: Judgement Day.We are then introduced to Laurie's family including her daughter Karen (who at aged 12 was taken away from Laurie by the state) and her granddaughter Allyson and some of her friends; all otherwise known as 'our potential victims'.The bus that is transferring Michael Myers and other patients from Smith's Grove to a maximum security prison is steered off the road (by Michael) allowing all patients to escape. Michael then kills a father and son who have stopped to investigate the accident and commandeers their car straight to Haddonfield where the expected killings ensue.But this strong start then proceeds to run out of steam very quickly.In Halloween (1978), John Carpenter took time for the audience to hang out with the characters and get to know them. Of course you knew they were going to meet a gruesome end, but you at least felt a little more for them when they did.In Halloween (2018) most of the victims are not developed enough to make us care anything for them and they serve as nothing more than disposable objects for Michael to hack, slash and beat his way through.The build up in the third act only leads to a fleeting and unrewarding showdown in which after some tense skulking around the house, Michael is trapped in a hidden cellar by Laurie (and other surviving members) which is then filled with gas and a lit match. As the cellar burns, Michael simply stares up at Laurie as she just stares straight back. Laurie and the survivors wrapped in supportive 'thank god we made it' embraces are then driven away from the scene.The final touch comes after the credits have rolled when we hear Michael breathing through his mask...I was prepared to judge this film on its own merits and not simply look at it as a direct continuation of the classic original.Despite some great acting from Jamie Lee Curtis and one or two other sporadic moments, Halloween (2018) fell short of the mark for me. It had a great deal of potential which for all its efforts, was sadly not fulfilled.Perhaps if you don't make the mistake I did of watching the two films as a double-bill, you will hopefully get more out of it. But my feeling is that you will feel a yearning to watch Halloween
(1978) straight afterward to remind you (as if you even need it) that classics are classics.",Halloween

I sat waiting for a good ""jump out of your seat"" moment and it never came. I do appreciate it staying true to the original in that it wasn't a gore fest like so many contemporary horror films but I have to say Michael was lack luster over all (maybe thats what happen when you're 60ish?)
I felt Jamie Lee Curtis' character was over the top with all the ""dooms day prepping"" not to mention I felt they made her look like she was pushing 70 not 60.

1204,aimi_sakuko,Friday the 31st,2,4 December 2018,"Very disappointing. The movie started out very well with little references and tidbits from the original but once the killing started, it steadily goes downhill.
Michael Myers is supposed to be a regular man who has aged for 40 years since the original event, yet this slow, plodding, old man goes on to kill a bunch of people including the police force, with ease. It is frustrating to see how seemingly easy everyone is to kill. To quote the comedian Pablo Francisco, ""you can choke them with a cordless phone.""
Not only are victims are easily killed, they are annoyingly dumb. One victim stands in the dark for several minutes, got stabbed, ran over to a nearby closed gate and yelling out for help while turning his back on Myers. All Michael had to do was walk slowly and stab him from behind. Two police officers go on to check a crime scene and easily missed Michael Myers who magically appears behind them and takes them out.
This slow old man got shot once by Jamie Lee Curtis early on and walked away like nothing happened. Got ran over by a car and woke up. Got shot again near the hidden staircase, stabbed again in the back, and still had the energy to fight. Overall the movie portrays Michael Myers as Jason Voorhees and almost everyone else as dumb college kids who have no sense or survival whatsoever. Completely unoriginal and I was more annoyed than anything.",Halloween

Boring, zero suspense, completely unlikeable characters every single one.I mean, there's literally no sense of dread - Myers just walks up and stabs people at will. It's just a mindless slasher film without any redeeming qualities. I've seen straight to DVD cheapo movies that were better than this. I made it halfway through this travesty and couldn't take it any more. I mean some of the latter Halloween sequels (that are ignored by this movie) were better than this.

I truly have no idea wth stupid critics and users are talking about when they rated this film. 7.9 right now with green metocritic reviews. The opening scene (where nothing happens) is so laughable. Reports hold a mask to micheal and the inmates go crazy. A smiling pumpkin? Random reporters that did and have no value to plot? A plot twist with the doctor? Not explained at all completely random. Why didn't Michael kill him on bus but killed him later on? The editing is a joke. All fast past cuts. Forget about slow burn stoking. Just micheal sees victim. Cut. Micheal kills victim. Did I talk about the random gore and overkill of every victim? Wow what a suspenseful movie... The only ""cool"" scene and I mean only is the drunk kid in the yard scene. Oh wait a secret underground basement? Let's go upstairs constantly and give away our position. Did I mention the characters? Completely unreliable and forgettable.

1218,tfitz24,A first act spent on developing disposable characters should've been used to set up a controversial twist.,7,22 October 2018,"Major spoilers. Move on. Read this when you're ready.I only want to review the plot twist of this newest Halloween sequel. The film in totality is pretty awesome and I have no real interest in diving into the rest since it's otherwise pretty good, but it has become clear to me after really ruminating over this film for the past couple of days after seeing it that the plot twist could have been a really interesting surprise as opposed to a poorly executed and near-fatal distraction from an otherwise good entry into such a celebrated horror franchise. Read on to hear my thoughts on how and why this could have been a better-executed twist.The character in question, the ""New Loomis"" as Laurie Strode mistakenly and questionably refers to (as I explain later), is Dr. Sartain, introduced in the first act as the doctor of Michael Myers who took the reins from old man Loomis after his passing.Sartain is introduced as a completely sensible and incredibly knowledgeable character who the screenwriters utilize as a tool for plot exposition in the first act, explaining to the British podcasting duo (and through osmosis, the audience) why Loomis is gone and why he is the guy who is looking after Michael now. He is never once given any sort of dialogue or unsettling scene that can clue us, the audience, in on what his true intentions are later on or why he matters so much to this film. It is a delicate balance for a screenwriter to give an audience *just enough* to anticipate a character's actions with dread, yet still morbidly satisfy the audience when a character lives up to our darkest expectations, and Dr. Sartain is one of those characters--unfortunately, we don't get the exposition necessary to give us something to suspect (or expect) about Sartain. The first act is crucial to laying out these kinds of connections, suspicions, and foreshadowing clues, and unfortunately, this opportunity is squandered.Instead, the entire first act is spent on setting up the motivations and developing the characters of the (entirely disposable and unnecessary) podcasters on one level, and on a more utilitarian and much more necessary level, the first act is utilized as a device to give Michael his mask and essentially get him to Haddonfield on October 31. It is crucial to get Michael from the loony bin and into the mask and overalls as expediently and sensibly as possible in these films, so kudos to Danny McBride and Co for doing this. Unfortunately, the characters used to do this were the podcasters, who are disposable characters and are given way, way too much screen time and are the first major characters we meet, which sets up certain expectations for these characters that are ultimately deflated and sabotaged when all that happens to them is they are murdered in the Halloween 4-homage truck stop bathroom early in the first act.Meanwhile, we basically see nothing of ""New Loomis"" until the bus crash that introduces act two, which he survives with some injury. Again, we have no reason to suspect anything of the doctor. I found myself as a viewer sympathetic towards Sartain when he is mistakenly shot by a bystander and seems to be on the verge of death as a result. If his arc were set up correctly, I would have felt somewhat of a sense of suspicion as to why the bus crashed and he was the lone survivor. Instead, I just watch the movie and feel for the doctor.Soon after, a major mistake is made by the screenwriter. Laurie Strode, upon meeting the good doctor near the end of the first act, refers to him as ""the new Loomis."" This is a huge problem with lasting ramifications given the character arc of Dr. Sartain. To fans of previous Halloween timelines, Dr. Loomis was a good man who wanted Michael to be exterminated, destroyed, removed from the world by any means possible, even at the expense of his life and safety. He saw Michael as simply an embodiment of evil who would only go on to harm others in his pursuit to kill and he wanted him wiped from the earth. So when the anchor of the entire Halloween universe, our most pure and trustworthy Final Girl Laurie Strode, explicitly names Sartain as ""New Loomis,"" we can rest easy knowing he, in fact, is *The New Loomis*. He embodies the same ethos as the late, great Donald Pleasance's character. He is the New Loomis and we have no reason to think otherwise, because we implicitly trust the character who bestows this moniker upon Sartain. Except, inexplicably, he is so totally not New Loomis, and we as the audience are subject to a horribly clunky plot twist as a result.Sartain, as we learn way, way too late into the second act, actually wants Michael to live, to go out and kill in Sartain's presence, so Sartain can see him kill ""in the wild."" He has absolutely no redeemable moral qualities whatsoever, unlike the good doctor whom he replaced. He wants Michael to kill innocent people and wants to study Michael doing so so intensely that he is willing to see what it actually feels like to do what Michael does--and damn it, he actually does. He murders a man in cold blood with a highly contrived scalpel-blade-hidden-inside-a-ballpoint-pen contraption he keeps in his pocket, and even dons Michael's mask to feel the full effect of his murderous actions. It is an utterly ridiculous turn of events and really sours the film until it is thankfully saved by the brilliant cat-and-mouse chase sequence inside Laurie's rural house in the woods outside Haddonfield that pits her against her ultimate nemesis, the *only* villain this franchise has room for, The Shape.And that leads me to my final thoughts on Halloween 2018. I give credit to the screenwriters for taking a major chance with a long-dormant horror franchise, I just wish that the first act was spent more on developing Dr. Sartain, a monumentally crucial character in this film, rather than the disposable and almost entirely useless podcaster characters. We could have developed a creeping, sneaking suspicion of Sartain's motivations throughout the first act that culminated in a satisfying murderous twist at the beginning of the third act, but instead we are treated with a highly questionable turn of events that come entirely out of left field that nearly ruin this film and raise some serious questions for the inevitable sequel. The Halloween franchise only has room for one villain--Michael Myers. Any attempt to subvert this unavoidable fact with a poorly-executed plot twist will only serve to muddy up the formula with convoluted film canon and put Halloween on track for more questionable sequels, which was the reason we had to wait all this time for such a good entry into the Halloween franchise in the first place. I sincerely hope the powers that be can learn from the mistakes of the past (and the mistakes of this sequel) to build upon and contribute to a horror franchise that continues to be as frustrating as it is promising. 7/10.",Halloween
1219,mafiaman9225,Giving a 10 to offset the bad reviews.,7,22 October 2018,I enjoyed this movie a ton. I would probably give it a 8-8.5/10 overall I loved the look of Michael Myers. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job as I expected the scream queen would! The kills were amazing to me. The John Carpetener score was really solid. Loved the feeling to it and the title cards look. There was obviously things I didn't like. Some of the comedy was misplaced and a couple of the young characters really bothered me. There's a few other negatives but overall I had a great time! I hope this is the end.,Halloween

1221,jaytheguvna,A really good movie,7,18 November 2018,"I watched this movie earlier today. From the start it felt very much like a follow on from the original movie. The characters were solid and pivotal to the plot. Now, as the movie begins, your thrust into the current timeline with a glimpse of Michael Myers. He's apparently been institutionalised for the last 40 years. We begin to see the current fascination in the character, as always its people sticking their nose into things they shouldn't.The character of Laurie Strode is fleshed out by showing how she has come to terms with what happened back in 1978. Her life is somewhat of a car crash as a result of the various traumas she's suffered at the hands of Michael. Jamie Lee Curtis plays the part extremely well. You can actually see the young girl that she was and sympathise as to her situation.The family are a very integral part of the plot. We see a young modern version of Laurie in her granddaughter. The past of Laurie bleeds into the relationship with her daughter and its rather sour. This is all explained in the plot.The new doctor in charge of Michael is a strange one, but a reasonable character. We get some back story on his predecessor, Dr Samuel ""Sam""Loomis, which is a nice touch. Its was almost inconceivable that this follow on wouldn't mention the great doctor from all those years ago. Theres a voice actor who simulates his voice for us to reminisce.As you've probably already guessed, Michael Myers goes on a killing spree on Halloween night. this isn't unexpected. However, the story doesn't suffer from this expected and unlikely plot twist. The killings are a constant and not as graphic as i expected. Many movies released now tend to go for the shock value, but Halloween 2018 sticks to its roots and is all the better for it.The ending is a good wrap but as you've already guessed, leaves the story wide open. I really enjoyed the film. Its a breath of fresh air, after so many years of the Halloween movies just being made for the sake of it. I give a strong 7/10",Halloween

1224,constantin-wollin,disappointed...,4,30 October 2018,"I really hoped this could become a good movie, mostly because they managed to gather the original cast. but in the end this
movie went down the hill ...It's the same problem that many other movies have. There was absolutely nothing special about Michael Meyers murdering people, because his motivation lacks pattern this time. also, his way of doing it is boring enough, so one should come up with some sort of a reasonable background maybe? There is none. Give us background to the people who die. So I might care about a death. Or give us depth for characters in general. We almost get no information on Lauries family. Or her friends. I almost felt asleep once. There is forced tension where it shouldn't belong. Some scenes that don't support plot are way too long. There are 2 investigators at the beginning who get killed way too fast. What happens to the male journalist, he was still alive when we last saw him. The structure is a mess: the lines of Meyers, Laurie, Lauries family, the doctor, the two journalists, Lauries friends, the police guy are all intertwined but do not seem to follow any particular order, they seem very arbitrarily connected and portioned in terms of screentime. It prevents the viewer from getting used to characters or anything really. the movie doesn't offer a single storyline with a little more depth. one time
we don't see Laurie for like 20 minutes. Is she the protagonist or what? If not, who is it we're supposed to identify with? Why use the most boring prison escape situation you can choose from? Because the first movie had it similar? 1978 references are okay as long as they dont effect the plot too much. Hasn't Laurie learnt from the past that shooting Meyers doesn't really work? Why the many shooting weapons? Just to somehow hope lure him into the trap cell? ok, but isn't it a bit inconvinient to use it as a panic room for her family at the same time, especially with that narrow entrance? why do that? its an awkward plot twist and it feels really forced and unnecessary. the ending was unimaginitive. Why can't we see Michael suffer? because it needs to be like in the first movie and you shouldn't alter anything about him at all? Ok, but then you also didn't have a problem with changing other ""rules"" of the slasher genre or at least Halloween in particular (e.g. killings have no pattern, doctor goes absolutely nuts and kills a cop). If you have an antagonist this ""deary"", there you have an aspect where you could potentially revolutionize Halloween. add something interesting to him we haven't seen before to make the ending a little more special maybe.So all in all, I don't like how it is written. Maybe others do, and thats ok. But to my mind, they could have done way better. i liked the music, the camera and the fact they gathered the original cast. 4/10",Halloween
1225,vytautas-pasvenskas,A superb slasher,7,9 November 2018,"I'm writing from the perspective of a person who hasn't watched the original Halloween(1979).
So what can I say.. Well I really like this sequel! In my opinion, there are a few pros and cons.
First of all pros:
The atmosphere of this movie is exceptional! Michael Myers truly is an unstoppable boogieman, something supernatural. A very familiar feeling to Predator or Alien- a creature which is the killing machine, with no
empathy. He is scary!
Furthermore, creators know what is scary and I'm talking about mystery. At the end of the movie Michael Myers face was still unknown and except breathing he didn't make much sound. He is the shape. This killer has nothing humanly about him. Unknown is scary and David Gordon Green knows that.
Moving on, the soundtrack, especially Michael Myers' theme song, is very cool and badass.
It is time for cons:
Characters in this movie are so dumb... They are a pile of cliches of every possible dumb character in horror movies. Some actions and decisions were so illogical that my brain start to hurt while remembering it.
In the nutshell, Halloween(2018) is amazing slasher and deserves positive reviews.",Halloween
1226,littlerinm,Slow,6,18 January 2019,"It's just so slow. I mean it was good when the bus crashed and from then on but it's just slow. I get why people like it, Its good but its also not scary. When I hear horror I think of like some psycho with a knife like Scream or a guy with a burnt face and knifes for fingernails like Nightmare on Elm street. Not some guy with a mask killing any random person. In Scream and Nightmare on Elm street they had targets and reasons why they killed people but in this he kills anyone. The ending was good when she shot him and set the house on fire and as well as how you dont know if hes really dead. Overall it was just ok. Would I see the next one? Maybe. We'll see if the next one is as just ok as this one.",Halloween
1227,randylebaron,Best movie since the original! Best mask period!!!,8,19 October 2018,"I watched it this morning, after binging all of the other incarnations this week w/ the exception of 3 which I don't recognize as being part of the series except for in name, and I can honestly say that I was pleasantly satisfied with it overall and sooooooo glad that they didn't use the ridiculously cheesy mask from 4-6. I actually thought the mask helped make the movie.The reason I gave it 8 versus a 10 are simply because some things were overplayed (spoiler: why build a safe roof if you won't ever stay in it) and I found the ending to be anticlimactic (which I hope means there WILL be a sequel). That being said there were some good twists (the doctor wanting to relate to Michael and see him in ""the wild"". It also begs the question if heather or not he actually let Michael free on the transfer bus), the kid being babysat added some comic relief, and this version of Laurie Strode actually makes the most sense since she is probably dealing with an intense and chronic form of PTSD.And, while they are all fresh, I thought I would rank the films since I am not in line with a lot of the typical rankings I have seen online.
1. HALLOWEEN (1978) The man, the myth, the maniac Michael Myers is born!
2. HALLOWEEN (2018) That mask though!!!
3. HALLOWEEN (Rob Zombie remake) Examining his childhood was interesting as was getting a much larger actor to portray him.
4. HALLOWEEN II Great ending but too much time spent in one location.
5. HALLOWEEN 4 Hated, I repeated, hated the mask but it was a good intro for Jaimie Lloyd and another good ending.
6. HALLOWEEN H2O Could've should've been better but scenes with Jaimie Lee were worth it.
7. HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION Everyone lists this as last but it was interesting seeing how he survived in between killing sprees.
8. HALLOWEEN 5 Did I mention the mask? Loved Dr. Loomis in every other one but this.
9. HALLOWEEN 2 (Rob Zombie Version) I watched it again and thought I would rate it higher if not considered a Halloween movie.
10. HALLOWEEN 6 Trying to ""explain"" Michael is like trying to explain Jaws. Both are better seen only occasionally and explained even less.

Did I really just spend twenty pounds on this? Maybe it will improve if I keep watching? Maybe the annoying teenage girl behind me will stop kicking the seat? But I digress.
The point is that this movie is painful to watch, the atmosphere is completely absent, it is not scary on any level and with no build up to a reveal it kinda felt like watching the movie version of a limping gazelle, fast at points but then utterly monotonous and tropey at other points. None of the characters are likable, theres a really stupid dumb 'twist' if you can call it that in the middle and the ending is just kinda meh.Sorry its awful but maybe this will finish off the series completely, nightmare on elm street 2010 was bad enough but this just destroyed the last lingering remnants of hope I had left.",Halloween
1231,itsnotemy,A fantastic homage to all of the films!,10,30 October 2018,"When I first heard this film was being made, I was skeptical that it would just be another failed reboot. I was so wrong.Not only does Jamie Lee Curtis return, but so does Nick Castle, the original actor behind the Shape.John Carpenter also signed on to do the music and help with executive producer next to Jamie Lee herself. This movie had all the backing it needed to become successful and David Gordon Green/Danny McBride KNOCKED IT out of the park.The film itself is billed as a true sequel to the original. We all know the story behind Halloween II (1982) and that John Carpenter did not want a sequel. That's why it wasn't as successful as the first and it opens a sibling story-line that no one really was happy about including Carpenter himself.This film attempts to erase that story, and all sequels after it and it does so in an effective way. It returns to the roots of the original. Michael has no motive, and that's what makes him so terrifying.There are many Easter eggs in this movie that reference all of the Halloween Films, check out trivia for info on those.The film itself is very well paced, and the music is very refreshing. While Halloween brings back some of the original score, it adds some newer music as well and it's just as good if not BETTER than the original ones, seriously, listen to the soundtrack if you haven't, my favorite was the Allyson chase scene.There are many similarities to the original as well. Without revealing any spoilers, all I'll say is there are mirrored scenes from the original (and other movies for that matter) but with a twist.Don't listen to the negative reviews, people only expect jump scares and gore these days, but this movie is not just that. There are some bloody moments, and scary moments as well, but this film relies more on psychological horror than cheap scares, just like original.If you want a well paced story, a powerful message, and some good ole fashioned Michael Myers bloodshed. This movie is for you.Be sure to stick around to the end credits! :D",Halloween

1234,Ancient-Gamer,Happy Halloween,8,2 November 2018,"David Gordon Green thought, what if we just ignore every Halloween sequel ever made (even the respectable Halloween II) and make a direct follow up to the original. A thought that turned out pretty good because it actually worked. This Halloween is by far the best sequel in the series.Jamie Lee curtis once again takes on the role of Laurie Strode and Nick Castle (and a few others) reprising the role of our beloved incarnation of evil. The story takes place 40 years after the events that happened on Halloween night. Laurie is now a mother and grandmother, but the emotional scars she suffered are still clearly visable. Michael has been locked up all this time, never speaking a word. Two podcast journalist want to get the whole story of what happened and even (try to) interview Michael as well as Laurie. The night before Halloween Michael, and a bunch of other patients, get transfered to another facility and of course all things go bad from there.So the setup for the story is not original, but it works for the movie. Jamie Lee does a great job portraing a Laurie who is truly scarred for life by the boogyman. Preparing herself and her daugther (Karen) for when she would ever face him again. Karen has a different view on life and doesn't want her daughter (Allyson) to really bond with grandma Laurie. Giving an fairly interesting broken family dynamic. Of course a Halloween movie is not complete without teenagers babysitting and trying to get their freak on. There is a bit of comic relief, that actually works, provided mostly by Julian (the kid that one of the teens is babysitting). Maybe the only sore thumb in the cast is Dr.Sartain. Although he is not completely afwul, he feels like the weakest character and the twist he brings is a bit out of place.But what most viewers want to see when watching Halloween is Michael Myers in action, and they will not be disappointed. The shape is brutal and shows why he is the boogeyman. It's not all gore, most of the time we get to see the end result instead of the actual deed, but it works. Halloween has always been about the fear and suspense of being hunted by a relentless killer, instead of bombarding us with gory kills. This Halloween respects what the original did and raises the bar for violence just a bit with a modern touch.In general fans of the series will not be disappointed by Halloween. Although not very scary, it is entertaining. One thing that has to be mentioned is the soundtrack. It's updated beautifully and used very effectively, making the mood for the movie spot on.

Amazing acting especially Andi Matichak! I cant wait to see where her career takes her!Overall an incredible movie.,Halloween
1236,scowy68-758-640859,Ok nothing special,6,30 October 2018,Started off quite well instilling that feeling of foreboding after Michael's escape and the atmosphere was building nicely just like in the original movie. However it dipped a bit in the middle and kind of got a bit silly toward the end. JLC done her best to carry the movie and she is still a wonderful actress but it's so difficult to capture the essence of the first movie all those years back and I couldn't help but feeling a little underwhelmed after leaving the cinema. Still for those of younger age and different era taking it as a stand alone movie it should be good fun.,Halloween
1237,snopek-758-908561,Different but Worthy Sequel,6,21 October 2018,"This film almost entirely keeps Michael Myers' faceless and speechless which keeps his mystique, despite an effective humanization, in tact.
-WHICH IS KEY
This film toes that line masterfully despite somewhat elongated POV/ tracking shots of MM's initially neighborhood killings.
Where Rob Zombie horribly over humanizes MM and the original makes him almost equal to the Devil, this film finds that sweet balance.
And in my opinion, that's where this film will either fail or succeed with critics.
(It succeeds)
The casting choices were spot on.
(The young actor who plays the kid being babysitted almost steals the movie)
And the updated score is both true to original and masterful form but refreshingly modern.Best horror film of the century, second ONLY to Hereditary",Halloween

Watching it, I try to analyse what decisions and choices they have made for effect (i.e. the horror side n' the spirit of the franchise) and structure (what surprises were installed); and in the end there is literally really nothing - the plot 'means well' but doesn't stand strong with its failed aspects, such as re-used ideas of killing, scaring and surprise twists in the plot. Minimum effect to depending how much hope n' effort the production simply had tried to put into this film. Its characters n' ideas are dried-up even for the younger generations to see this as their first taste of the franchise. The aim didn't have the right people; the original was raw n' breath taking to cinema (horror cinema especially), the new technology of filmmaking today can't 'likely' save or come close to it.

I grew up watching horror/thriller movies with my parents and Halloween became our all time favorite! I was truly amazed at how they kept it up to today's culture but still made Michael as ruthless as ever. Like he gave zero damns about who he needed to kill. While there were some parts that needed some minor editing (first off why the heck would any Doctor allow a patient to see something that will make the patient go bezerk. Yeah let's just show and remind Michael that he is a killer by showing him his mask...what could go wrong?). I think they casted all the right people for their respective parts. The granddaughter was amazing! Everyone that needed to die(except for the kid in the truck) died. The end kept me looped in. The doctor made me mad as hell all throughout the movie. Who gave this man a Doctorates in Behavioral Psych? But I guess the question is, did I love it? Well, I cried when Michael was one on one with Laurie. Enough said.",Halloween

The soundtrack has a modern touch to it since they changed some of the music parts, others remained the same. For me, the killing scenes could have been a bit more brutal. The movie is not better than my all time favorite Halloween remake by Rob zombie (don't hate me for that lol), but we also have seen worse in the past.",Halloween
1243,kybandit78,Best Halloween film since the original ... 40 years in the making!!,9,19 October 2018,"I went to both screenings on Thursday, October 18, 2018. From the start. there were lines and sold out theaters. It is rare in my town that a film will sell out for both initial screenings, sometimes it will be close, but never a sale out crowd.I knew instantly that this was going to be a magical night for horror fans. I am one of the biggest Halloween fans there is. I love all the films ... yes, even the bad ones. I tried to avoid as much news about this film, but I did watch the two main trailers, which did give some stuff away. At the same time, the trailers got my hyped even more, which usually worries me before a film that I really want to watch.Once the film started, I was back in Halloween fanboy heaven. I loved the nods to the previous films, and was able to catch some small details throughout that made me smile. I did have a couple of issues with two or three scenes, but the redeeming value of the film as a whole made up for those brief lackluster scenes.The cinematography, the score, the acting, and the story brought me back to when I first watched John Carpenter's Halloween.Sure there are some flaws, but guess what ... Michael Myers is back on the big screen and it is everything a Halloween fan should love and enjoy. There is a rejuvenation of horror films on the big screens of late, and with Halloween 2018 that train keeps on rolling.I can't wait to do a spoiler filled review on Land of the Creeps Podcast in the coming days. It will be a blast to dive into this one with Greg, Justin, Jessie, and Doc.",Halloween

1245,fierfek,Good.. but not Great,7,28 December 2018,If you watched the movie and didn't like it.. don't pretend it is a 1/10. While it lacked a real scare factor.. it wasn't a bad movie. Giving it anything less than 6/10 just means you only see in black and white.While it could have been a better horror film..

Recommended for any Halloween fan or horror movie fan overall, Michael Myers is back and ready to stalk his prey.",Halloween
1247,bjordan396,Undoubtedly best sequel to the original!!,10,25 November 2018,"I'll admit that I had some reservations about this movie when I first heard it was being made. There have been good and bad sequels to the original Halloween (1978). However, while this movie is not perfect, it truly feels like an authentic sequel to one of the scariest movies of all time.It follows Laurie Strode forty years after the first movie. While she lives in fear, she is ready for Michaels return to Haddonfield. She is visited by two crime podcasters and paid $3000 for her time. She uses the money to give to her granddaughter. She lost custody of her daughter and has a rocky relationship with her.Meanwhile, Michael escapes and heads back to Haddonfield to continue what he started decades ago which leads to one hell of a showdown between him and Laurie.Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent and I appreciate the women empowerment theme here with three generations of Strode women participating. Also noteworthy is the lack of nudity. The other characters are also well acted as well. The movie is an hour and forty five minutes long but it is never dull. It is scary, suspenseful and has a lot of references to other movies in the franchise. For me, the highlights include a steady cam shot of Michael on Halloween night, a babysitter scene, a death involving motion sensor lights and the climax. The kills are brutal without being gratuitous and the gore is not over the top either.I've seen this three times already and I can't wait to own it on blu ray. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 🎃",Halloween
1248,mjfc1980,Pepole is overreacting to this,6,26 October 2018,"The truth is classic horror movies were done at his time only to entertain people always meant to be type b movies with not much valuable artistic content and then they adquire value because of the time, they become clasic movies and i respect that, but they are very overrated.

1252,andy-segerman,Horrifyingly Amazing,8,11 November 2018,"Unlike some of the original Halloween movies, this one got right to the killing and the suspense. The sheer brutality of these murders is what made this movie great and all the more horrifying. I myself am a much bigger fan of these psychological horror films rather than the paranormal ones for one reason. This could actually happen. This movie was so real to the viewer that it left me checking the back seat of my car after I left the movie just to make sure The Shape wasn't in my back seat. This was a must see movie that leaves you wondering how safe you really are.",Halloween

1254,mark-doster,I couldn't wait for it to be over...,3,19 October 2018,"It blows my mind that I am saying this but this movie just is not good at ALL. It had no idea what style it was trying to be. It involved characters that weren't needed and were fleeting. It still acts as though Laurie is Michael's sister even though she isn't and I did not believe that Laurie could be that crazy after 40 years, still stuck on that one night. The characters were not interesting or likable. They snuck in comedy at wrong moments. The pacing was off. It would rev up, slow down, take a sharp left turn, then slow down again, rev up for a second. There was little to no suspense or build-up. It was as though they just hoped having the Myers character would make everyone happy and they did not care to make anything else enjoyable. They just did not know what they were going for with this one. I compare it to sitting in a room with 3 TVs that each have completely different programs on each and you're taking turns watching all 3 at once. That's how inconsistent this movie felt.
I could not wait for it to be over...",Halloween
1255,Patrickjohnson859,Worthy,8,19 October 2018,"Not perfect. A couple of uneven scenes in terms of characters, perhaps a little too much editing to get to an hour and a half runtime. It was thankfully not just a Jamie lee Curtis vehicle which H2O was to a certain degree. I'm just sayin that Laurie's presence in these flicks preordaines certain events and removes some tension throughout. What if there was no particular last girl?You do not get up to go pee 30 minutes into this one so plan ahead.So the cussing is fairly low given the genre as was the sexual content. There were several good jump scares and several good scenes where Michael slips in and out of view. For me these were all pluses and matches the tone of the original.There is some humor that seems to be present in all things these days but here it bordered on parody. While funny it pulled me out of the disbelief a bit and kind of broke the spell but that ushered in the third act which had virtually none.The ending came as it must. Not my favorite but certainly the hardest part of these and given you cant copy the originals it will suffice.the classic theme music is there updated in some places and even some of the sound effects from the original are there to serve as cues or perhaps a nod to the fans. The contemporary song choices however leave plenty to be desired for this now 44 year old reviewer. Might be age but time will tell.All in all it's a good flick. I got to watch it the night before release in a small town in a small theatre which was straight up out of 1978 that did plenty to set the mood. This was all totally by chance at the last second which probably upped my vote from a 7 to an 8.",Halloween

Back to basics. No more outlandish plot lines. Simple horror.... Instead we get foolish sub-plots involving a clownish new doctor, awkward pubescent humor, complicated booby traps, and a 61 year old Myers pummelling people like Schwarzenegger in Raw Deal.The few highlights are Carpenter's new score and the subtle tributes paid to parts 1,2 and 3.Overall, not horrible but simply disappointing in several ways.

The acting performances are phenomenal and Jamie Lee Curtis proves once and for all that she is one of the best actresses out there. The soundtrack is a masterpiece with the legendary John Carpenter at the wheel. There is humor in this movie and it surprisingly works very well. I was shocked that I was laughing out loud during a Halloween movie. However, don't let the humor paint the wrong picture. This movie is a terrifying, emotional, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Michael Myers remains one of the best characters in fiction, and he hasn't said a word. This film isn't just a movie, it is an experience.",Halloween
1265,austinharbaugh,I loved it,10,20 October 2018,"I went and saw Halloween last night. And I have to say I was impressed. The best part about it is this movie is they cut out all of the BS middle Halloween movies. They made it were it's just the original 1978 Halloween and 40 years later it's this one. The story line flows well defines its characters with ease and it creates a realistic environment making the movie believable. There are no possessions or supernatural monsters in this, it's simply a psychotic murderer that does not stop. It brings back all of the old gruesome deaths that we all remember from the old one and takes it up another level. Simply put this will give slasher movies a bump that they need, just as the first one did. Jamie Lee Curtis was superb as to be expected she embodies her character making you feel sympathy for what she is going through along with giving you reason to root for her. Surprising the film dives into the workings of the inner mind in a way creating something different for you to process during the film. In the end, if you are a horror fan, old school slasher flick fan, or just a movie fan go see it in theaters and enjoy the ride.",Halloween

1267,tylerdixon-53081,It's Just Okay...Not Awful...Not Great,8,3 November 2018,"As a huge fan of the Halloween franchise, I could hardly contain my excitement & hype for this movie. With all the great reviews pilling up before I had gotten the chance to see it for myself I thought ""wow, this actually might be the best movie in the entire franchise"" & as much as it pains me to say...I was wrong. The movie is really just okay, it's not awful by any means but it's definitely not great. I will say that Laurie Strode played by (Jamie Lee Curtis) once again absolutely nailed it out of the park with her performance. She was fantastic, Michael Myers looked awesome as well. My problem I had with this particular film was some of the characters. There was this certain character which just annoyed me to death & really boggled down the film for me personally. I feel as if they focused way to much on Laurie Strode's granddaughter played by (Andi Matichak) who was really good in the film but she just became the main focus after a while instead of focusing on Laurie Strode. I will say the last half hour had me glued to my seat for the Laurie Vs. Michael showdown. I was very happy with the ending & the humor in this film was actually good & didn't hurt the movie in anyway but really in the end this just didn't live up to the hype for me personally. This is not a bad film but it's not great either but if you're a fan of the Halloween franchise in any way. I recommend you check this one out...you may enjoy more then I did.",Halloween

Why are movie makers killing off horror",Halloween
1273,dreadfullyfunny,Helpless woman....ugh,3,24 March 2019,"First the scene with the reporter in the bathroom where she is huddle in a corner with a crowbar screaming helplessly while her friend is getting the snot knocked out of him by Myers. Why isnt she doing what any woman would do in and taking the crowbar and beating the stuffing out of michael. Most of the scenes with woman seem to write them as helpless victims. Really i thought we where living in a more enlighten age where woman have proven themselfs just as fierce as any man. This scene in the bathroom was dumb because nither had to die as long as she actually used the crowbar to help her friend.
Then dont get started on how dumb the doctor was for protecting Michael after the cop hit Myers with his car. Saying he needed to be studied. Then pulled a knife and killed the cop. Really? I mean this is a little lesser atrocities the writing in this movie comits.
But the ending where they have myers trapped in the basement and he is looking up at them threw the bars. Instead of just putting a couple of bullets in him and maybe even cutting off his head to make to make sure he is actually dead this time they instead have grandma start the gas then drops a flare down between the bars which sets the whole house on fire. This was the dumbest ending i could think of. This pist me off enough to write this review. I mean the only reason i could think of for ending the movie like this is because if they ever make a another Halloween they could write it off as him escaping or they didn't find the body. So this was just so they have means for another story. Also why on earth is grandma going to make herself homeless when she doesn't have too? That was the other thing that upset me about this ending because again a couple of bullets in his head and maybe even decapitating him would haven have worked and she could live in the house free of the fear of Michael ever finding her again.
Yet it is this kind of junk that really takes me out of a story because a story has to be somewhat believable and the characters to act what real life people may act like if in the same situations as the characters in the movie.

1276,bunnylaff,An awful addition insulting a classic movie.,1,3 November 2018,"With so much to dislike about this appalling offering of a movie it's hard to find anything that was done successfully.Between the atrocious acting, multiple paper thin characters, a Michael Myers COMPLETELY detached from the original premise of pure evil and displayed unmasked multiple times, it was shocking to hear that John Carpenter was in any way affiliated with this movie.The one scene that seemed to keep the original sense of claustrophobic dread from the original was the scene in the toilets with the two journalists/podcasters, but besides this the rest of the movie was desecrated with cringey pitiful comedy.There was a complete lack of dread and suspense which traditionally surrounded the ominous and looming character of Michael Myers. We simply followed him around as he picked and choosed who to kill and inexplicably overlooked others.The sickeningly blatant 'girl power' ending was equally pathetic, and the token black kid character just completely detracted from this movie. Laurie's complete lack of fear or concern towards Michael also totally undermined what was previously terrifying about his presence.Overall, this was disgusting. A sad sign of what modern horror has become, designed for kids, completely out of the spirit of classic movies and riddled with inconsistency.I could go on, but won't.

But anyway jamie lee gives another great performance as does nick castle, no one has quite mastered the myers movement since he departed the mask so glad to see him back. Some great deaths and a couple of jumps along the way. 2 minor issues, one, the trailer gave away a huge chunk of the film and two, a needless plot twist 3/4s of the way through.

The story is awkward and contrived, and the characters make every poor decision possible.

I was therefore very hyped for this version, taking it back to it's roots and a return of Jamie Lee Curtis as the iconic Laurie Strode.
I wasn't dissapointed at all! It captures all of the masterful suspense and tension of the orignal with Michael back on form as an unstoppable mysterious force of nature. He is violent, brutal and truly terrifying, but in a way that keeps true to the classic, rather than the Rob Zombie version. The famous musical score is back and updated and it's really, really awesome.
There was some concern that this was written by people usually involved in comedy. There are funny moments - but it is not humour for the sake of it, it all fits in well with the film and make no mistake - this is definitely a horror movie. This is the scariest rendition of Michael Myers to date.
I removed 2 stars becuase I thought the Dr. character was out of place and his story arc didn't fit in with the film.
I definitely reccomend going to see this, they did a really good job and you can tell it was made with a genuine appreciation and admiration of the original. Fantastic performances from all actors, well directed and a great, distinctive plot.",Halloween
1288,jansundstedt,Avoid at all costs!,2,1 November 2021,"I turned this off after about 40 minutes (blu-ray). I couldn´t stand any more of this garbage. John Carpenter must have been paid truck loads of money for agreeing to do the score. The writer and director should be driven out of Hollywood forever. This is just another WOKE- and PC-movie. I don´t know why they keep on making them? One thing I do know though; it is not about making great (or even good) films.Michael Myers has become a random killing machine. Killing people here and there whenever he feels like it. Killing spree deluxe, if you like. He was never like that in the original. Everything he did served a demented and twisted purpose. In the original he even hinted some sort of humanity, when Tommy Doyle bumps into him at the school yard (after Tommy´s been bullied seconds earlier). He didn´t kill children (Judith Myers was a teenager). In this piece of garbage he does. That just sickens me. And of course all males are; wimps, useless, lame and weak. The character of Laurie Strode should be locked up at the same asylum as Michael. As far as I am concerned, she is as deranged as Michael.For me, the ""Halloween"" franchise consists of the 1978 original, ""HII"", ""HIII"" and the quite decent ""H20"". My rating of two stars is for..well, I don´t know? Nostalgia? The music?By the way: ""Halloween III"" is a great little horror movie (to the ""HIII"" haters out there)...",Halloween
1289,cabotlboyd,Cinematic masterpiece and a fun watch,9,3 November 2018,"One of the best horror movies I have ever seen. Sequels are usually not as good, just look at the previous Halloween movies, but this one replaces them all. It takes place forty years after the original and takes place once again on Halloween night. This movie did a great job of setting up Michael's escape during a transfer and a return to Haddonfield as he tries to kill Laurie Strode who has been preparing for his return for decades. This installment does a great job of taking what's great from the original and implementing it again here. The return of the classic sound track helped build the atmosphere and kept audiences on the edge of their seats.
Another thing that this movie did very well was using every inch of the screen to tell the story, hiding Michael in the background in a few scenes, just like in the original. One scene that comes to mind is the scene at the gas station where Dana Haines and Aaron Korey, the reporters doing a podcast on the babysitter killings, are taking a break from the road. Dana goes to the restroom while Aaron fills up the car. Meanwhile, in the background, you can see Michael Myers walk across the screen and into the mechanic shop and kill the worker while Dana askes where the bathroom is. The scene is creepy as you watch Michael kill while the characters in the foreground have no clue what is happening.
The second scene that I want to talk about and my personal favorite is when Michael is walking around while kids are trick or treating around him. The entire scene is shot with no cuts, using a flying camera as he goes in and out of houses, trying to find his preferred weapon, an oversized kitchen knife. The cinematography in this scene is incredible, having him in the middle of the screen and then having him disappear around corners to commit a murder. One of the best visuals in this scene is when the camera shows Michael walking onto a porch and looking through a window then leaves, but the camera stays on the woman in the house. You can see Michael walking to the back of the house through another side window and then come in the back of the house to kill the woman.
As a casual movie goer, I loved it because it was terrifying and fun to search the entire screen trying to find Michael or other hidden storytelling devices. As a critic, I also loved the movie. The combination of the camerawork, the music, and the dark lighting contrasted with flood and headlights created a terrifying atmosphere that made you turn your head away because of the suspense but you couldn't stop watching because it was so well done. I highly regarded the original Halloween as one of my favorite horror movies but this one might have just passed that.Casual score: 9.7/10
Critic score: 9.2/10",Halloween

This movie was smart, it was well crafted with a stellar soundtrack, and the inclusion of the original director, John Carpenter, ensured that it was a faithful and solid remake.

It's brutal (more brutal than the original), contains quite some blood, but at the same time it has a good story. Great role models in the movie (the Strodes), and it also contains tons of references to the other Halloween movies (the original and the ones that aren't counted). It's overall creepy, awesome. The music is such a throw back to the original. I want to see it again.This movie captures the 40 years of life between Laurie, and her daughter. Also the granddaughter.

They kept it simple, and simple worked. Of course they added the predictable jump scenes, but nothing too cliché. Every scene was used correctly to build up the right amount of suspense. This film seems to serve as a means to an end. Whether it's truly the end of an era for the Halloween franchise, or just an end for Laurie's storyline, is questionable. Whatever the case, it was enjoyable to watch.",Halloween

1312,emmanuelgzz-90926,"Terribly written, even for a slasher film!",1,2 December 2018,"No logic, full of contrivances, gross death scenes and poorly written characters placed in poorly written case scenarios.
The story tells us about a maladaptive woman coping with her trauma by isolating herself at her own house, which has a sophisticated security system, booby traps and weapons hidden behind the wall, using them to practice targeting shooting in her own patio, destroying mannequins' heads and torsos. Her trauma didn't prevent her though to get married and procreate. That's Laurie Strode for you. I liked the H20's Laurie Strode better, she at least was socially functional.
Michael Myers isn't hiding this time around eating rats, dogs and whatnot between the sequels. He is secluded in a mental institution after killing the astonishing amount of 5 people! 40 years later, staff at the mental institution is preparing to transfer the boogeyman at a maximum security prison so he could spent the last days of his life imprisoned there. But after an unexplained bus crash (thanks Mcbride and Green), he escapes and goes to Haddonfield to kill people once again.
The majority of the characters serves only for the death scenes, and there's one particularly irrelevant that by the third act reveals his evil side and helps Michael to escape and kill but since he is so unconnected to the story nothing can be said about him, only that Michael crushes his head with his bare foot and explodes like a watermelon, brain matter and all that is shown on screen.
From start to finish, the movie centers the story to different parts that it is so distracting you end up not caring about anyone. Death scenes are gory but most of them happen off screen and aren't suspenseful or scary. This movie lives in a little universe where the other sequels don't exist, however, there are moments within this one which tell the audience these sequels are recognized and that can be confusing. (The ""Resurrection van, with a strange woman after the blonde guy does the peace sign but you can tell he is saying ""2"" as in, we are in a Halloween 2 movie and we are ignoring Resurrection... yes, this movie is full of itself as well).
There's one scene in this film I find hilarious, and that's when Michael is being chased by a policeman and Mr. Irrelevant while he tranquil walks down the streets, only to get ran over by the police car and left unconscious on the floor. So many opportunities many characters have had to kill Michael and this is by far the luckiest and easiest one and all ruined by Mr. Irrelevant.
Halloween 2018 lacks what made the first one so scary, I want to think that other than making this film for the money, it had the same intentions as H20 had before it was filmed, to put an end to a disgraced franchise and close it with dignity... but two things... this movie isn't good enough to enclosure anything neither is going to be the last one.",Halloween

After seeing a 10 rating - I have to ask if these people were paid to review this awful movie. But after a misleading trailer - I had to.
First and foremost - I am a HUGE Halloween fan and tonight I am disappointed.
Movie sucked. 2 hours where it dragged, no climax, no story. Haddonfield was more like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It had a very ridiculous ""plot"". Laurie Strode is NOT new Sarah Connor. Jamie Lee Curtis going around saying this is a film about trauma and plugging in the MeToo movement is completely idiotic.Gory scenes and a few jump scares. Do not believe the hype.
I gave it 1 star because watching the trailer & watching the movie you can see the rumors about an early screening were true! (Trailer had scenes that the movie didn't). And it did not go well back in April. Well the final product is trash!Reason I didnt walk out the theater was because I believed it would get better. It didn't. Stupid, boring movie.",Halloween

I shouldn't have broken my own rules and read the reviews before seeing it. I was was pleasantly surprised with what they have done. It has so many elements of the original, from camera angles to the atmosphere. It's far scarier than I thought it would be and some of the kills are very graphic. It also has some laugh out loud moments. Now I am also a fan of H20 which of course has nothing to do with this Halloween. I see H20 and this Halloween as two different ways Laurie Strodes life could have gone. In H20 she has run away and changed her name in a bid to escape the evil. In this Halloween she stays put and fights for he life and the lives of her family. A great success as a sequel and as a stand alone movie.",Halloween

The original was full of suspense, tension and atmosphere. The same can't be said for this sequel.On some occasions this movie tries too hard to appeal to the youth market and be comedic. The only solid characters are Laurie Strode (strong, flawed, human), Michael Myers (dark, brooding, relentless) and somewhat Allyson, Laurie's granddaughter. Everyone else is disposable or a cliche stereotype. For example, one of Allyson's friends is a so called ""edgy bad boy"" and Michael's new doctor is a discount Dr. Loomis. A lot of the kills are also off screen. Some of the dialogue is terrible. At times the movie felt like it lacked focus. The ending is kind of anti-climatic and feels sort of abrupt.There are also some positives to this film. The Strode family, the kills that are shown are brutal, Michael Myers is sick and there's also a funny kid that kept the audience laughing.",Halloween
1321,annitaylor,5 for fantastic actors. 0 for the film,5,27 October 2018,"First, I want to say that all the actors were great. Especially JLC. They all acted their parts well and were believable. JLC was fantastic to watch.It started so well. The two reporters going to the secure property owned by Laurie Strode and trying to convince her to meet with Myers and put her demons to rest. Laurie's lifetime fear and preparation for the return of Myers was over-the-top but hey, it's a movie and not meant to be true to life. But it was believable that someone would be severely traumatised and not be able to get past what happened. And the part with the reporters in the jail trying to talk with Myers was great, too.But after those opening scenes, the film itself was so silly. I couldn't believe the writers had written in so many plot holes and silly bits. Also so many wasted scenes.A bus is escorting prisoners on Halloween night crashes. The prisoners escape. (Let's forget the laughable security)The escaped Myers just happens to come across the two reporters who tried to talk to him in jail and who just happen to have his old mask. The female reporters sees a man come into the petrol station toilet acting creepily while she's sitting on the toilet, but she just rolls her eyes and isn't scared at all. When he rattles her toilet door she just calls out that it's being occupied. A woman alone in a bathroom who sees a man slowly walk up and down, let alone try to get into her stall (when the others are empty) is going to be seriously freaking.Two police officers look at the list of escaped prisoners and note that Mike Myers is on the list. One of those police officers was there back in the 70s when Myers was last on the rampage. What do they say? They say they can't shut down Halloween and then they have a chuckle. Yep, let the kiddies go trick or treating while a serial killer is on the loose! Don't ruin their fun!When the keystone cops realise Myers is killing people, you'd think they'd bring in masses of police, including SWAT teams. I think it might have been mentioned at an early point. But did it happen? Ummmm....no. It's all just local police bumbling about, including the two police who were sitting in a police car and looking at each other's lunch boxes and giggling.Laurie Strode says she prayed every night for Myers to escape from jail so she could kill him. Huh? She was happy for him to get out so he could kill a crapload of people just so she could kill him? Wouldn't she pray for him to die in jail or at least stay there?When the parents of the teenage girl (Strode's daughter and son-in-law) find out Myers is on the loose and their daughter is missing, what do they do? They go and hide away in Strode's house. What??? ANY parent would be out there driving around and searching for their kid, not in a bunker protecting themselves. The father was actually playing with a yo-yo just before he was killed - and no wonder. Too dumb to live.Strode brought her daughter up like the kid in Kickass. Taught to shoot and fight and outwit a killer. But the daughter (now in her 40s) is a useless sap, all the way to the end. She does finally pick up a gun. (Why are guns so damned scary to women in movies?Strode being so terrified of Myers that she was screaming was disappointing, too. She'd had all those years to harden herself.Strode had all that equipment in her house but still didn't have a headlamp to use instead of the stupidly awkward flashlight? Carrying a flashlight and a gun together is just plain dumb.Why the script didn't call for the three generations of women to work together to outwit Myers is beyond me. Instead, it was just a dribble of events. Did the three women have to turn into a screaming mess? It was such unsatisfying ending.In the beginning, Strode believes Myers is supernatural (the bogeyman). She goes to watch the prison bus leave that night. She's been waiting all these years for her chance to kill him and should have a pretty good idea that a supernatural being is gonna escape from a bus. But what does she do? She goes to a restaurant where her family is and starts raving about Myers - instead of, oh, tracking the bus and seeing for herself if Myers escapes or not, and then luring him back to her house and trying to trap him (not that this was ever a solid plan, but it was her only plan).There was no real plan. If you want to lure someone and trap them, this is not the way to go about it, folks.",Halloween

1324,kregmcm,rest easy this Halloween!!!,5,13 December 2018,"The good things about this sequel are obvious to any Halloween franchise fan, the score was great (Carpenter slays any score he touches), the homages to the previous films (although it removes all sequels from its canon) and having Jamie Lee back, made it a film that felt familiarly comfortable enough to enjoy. That being said, for me that is all this sequel got right.40 years after murdering Laurie strodes friends, Michael Meyers returns to Haddonfield for another vicious (mostly offscreen) merry go round of horror. Unfortunately for the film, his pursuit of Laurie is no longer warranted or logical given the removal of his sibling ties with her, established in the sequels previously. It feels like he is now simply targeting her for essentially no reason, none at all.
But now Stode is a PTSD ridden, agoraphobic (thanks Rob zombies H2) survivalist who has prepared the rest of her life for a moment like this, this being his escape and sudden return to Haddonfield.
While this does serve the plot, it also is a bit illogical, if she truly was that PTSD ridden she would not have remained in such close proximity to where her former assailant was housed, and Curtis performance ranges From excellent to disjointed in some scenes.The addition of her daughter (Judy G) and her grand daughter (Andi M) provided two new generations to be terrorized at the hands of Meyers, and both actresses succeed in my eyes at playing these roles, however the film could have entirely survived without the grand daughter character with a few simple line changes and name swaps, which makes her role a bit redundant, as it does feel when watching, as she serves nothing to the plot beyond coaxing her grandmother out of reclusivity.The opening shot with the two pod casters at the psych ward was far fetched as no professional establishment would have allowed them to come in and wave that mask in his face and taunt him the way they did, however these two characters were my favourites of the new faces in the film, albeit short lived.The plot seems to stumble for the majority of the film, with essential Meyers traits being eradicated from the film itself, no more stalking of his prey, and very little character development which in itself lets the film down massively.There was only one character who was murdered that we feel anything for, in my opinion, that being the babysitter who did a very good job of what little she was given, when she slips because of the type of socks she is wearing, I could feel that fear in my bones because it was a very natural incident that could happen to any of us, very well done.Unfortunately the film holds very few scares, if any, this film was definitely made just to squeeze a few more bucks out of us movie viewers, because there was very little in the film that warranted its production, twenty years later was a far superior film to this one, curtis is clearly lying through her teeth saying it was the idea of the film that had her jump back into the role, it was clearly the money because the film holds no genuine unease or tension beyond a few pop up jolts which you can predict coming.It isn't as bad as those who disliked it feel it was, but it was nowhere near as good as the ten star reviews I've been seeing. It is a wholly watchable film, but to me most of the sequels are, and in fact I could say I would watch it again because it does hold nostalgic sentiment, but it could have and in fact should have been a scarier, superior film than it wound up being.",Halloween
1325,thebishopv,Scary as hell.,10,8 September 2019,"My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece.Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael has come home to murder again.The story is perfectly simple, Michael stalks and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.The dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing.The acting is roundelay good. PJ Soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. And of course there is the perfectly cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. Combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.Never the less, I have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Highest Reguards.",Halloween

1327,sonofnick,Halloween noir?,6,9 December 2018,"A Halloween movie that made me think. Huh. Usually I just enjoy the mayhem and the violence. Very little thinking involved. Then along comes this movie where they seem to throw out all the supernatural elements and make it more realistic? I don't know if I want to think during or after a Halloween movie, but this one did.
On the downside, I think they followed Michael around too much. The best part of these kind of movies is not knowing which is getting harder and harder to do well. This movie didn't do that even during the closest scenes. Maybe I have just watched too many horror movies.
Overall, it was a good movie. I don't think it was a Halloween movie. It was a Michael Meyers movie. It personalized the monster making it more human and less ominous.",Halloween

1330,OakTreeConspiracy,Worthy an well executed. I liked it!,7,26 October 2018,"Going back to the Mid-80s, when I first saw Halloween on late night TV as a young Teenager, this new installment brings back some memories. It has the dark look and feel of the the original that made it such a feast. Ratingwise, I may not be the average Halloween fan. I did like the back to back idea of H2 right away, I did like the Producer Cut of H6 (not the theatrical version), I still don't like H3 and H20 very much. Rob Zombie.... don't know really.Now back to the present: Jamie Lee Curtis IS Laurie Strode, it's her Life role and she inhabits it once again with a great performance. Michael has aged equally and - at first - seems more human but maybe that's just the broad daylight. But that changes as soon as the bus crashes. This is where this movie differs big time from the original: the bodycount and the gore, which I felt were too much at times. I get that Michael has been locked away for 40 years, is angry and needs to quench his thirst but the randomness of his victims and brutality of his kills feel unnecessary at times and are rather on the level of the sequels. But maybe that's just the Zeitgeist of the 2018 horror/slasher movie and I didn't get it.The movie doesn't try to explain Michael's motivation or background and neglects the ""Laurie is his sister""-storyline that was established in the sequels. This of course makes sense as the new movie ignores all of them. Well kind of, as it still pays all sorts of homages to some of the sequels which is pretty cool. The doctor-storyline is a bit of a mystery to me. Did he trigger Michael's escape? Was he mental all the way or did he lapse at some point during the night? Not a very satisfying part of the story. Also Sheriff Barker, he must have had more screen time initially. He just disappears after 2/3 of the movie. Or maybe he's saved for a sequel?Nevertheless, it's a pretty good and solid movie and I liked it.",Halloween

1334,lacalleveloso,Not aging too well.,5,26 October 2020,"The first time I watched this in theaters, I thought it was an awesome movie and the best Halloween sequel of all time. Now rewatching it for the second time on Prime Video, I don't think it is aging too well.This movie has several problems. Firstly, the connection between Michael and Laurie is not the same when they aren't siblings. They turned the character of Laurie into a paranoid freak and it just didn't work. She's even more paranoid here than she was on H20.Secondly, this movie has a lot of characters who randomly appear(or disappear) for no reason. We have no idea what happens with the boyfriend of Laurie's granddaughter. They kill off the two British journalists right in the beginning, even though they were more interesting than most of the other characters. They introduce the obnoxious character ""Dr. Sartain"" right in the middle of the movie, and try to shove him as a new Dr. Loomis, something the character of Laurie even mentions right after the character is introduced for no reason at all. Also, the twist that he was the villain was cringeworthy as hell, especially considering that we don't even get to sympathize with the character.And last but not least, the pace of the movie felt way too rushed. They introduce us to way too many characters that we don't have the time to start caring for.Overall the movie is aging terribly in my book, and I wouldn't be surprised if I lower the rating of it a few years from now. I'll take Halloween 2, Halloween 3(even without Michael), Halloween 4 & 5 and Halloween H20 over this one at any day.",Halloween
1335,netkiffing,Horrible Movie,1,13 November 2018,"This movie is horrible. The amount and size of plot holes could be used to drive several trucks through. Laurie Strode has been waiting and training for this moment for a life time and yet still comes off as inept. Micheal Myers has some of the best GPS, he must have come loaded with Google maps because he knows where everyone is and the location of everyone's homes. This movie could have been so much more. Laurie Strode could have been so much better.",Halloween
1336,bmwalker-03960,The 2nd best film in the series...,8,27 September 2019,"Before I start on this film, I need to get it out of the way that I am a diehard fan of the series and it holds a place in my heart for many reasons. I'll try to keep my bias out of it and review it like any other horror film...That being said, I loved this movie. It didn't quite hit the heights I had hoped for after seeing the trailer. The hype it built within me was insane. But in the grand scheme of things, it's the only film in the franchise that got anywhere close to the quality of the original.I saw it in the cinema and felt like it was very short but the runtime says otherwise. And I think it felt short for two opposing reasons. Firstly, it's simply as fun a slasher movie as you'll find in today's horror market. They let Michael off the leash (or someone did) and he does what he does best, casting a shadow over Haddonfield and slaughtering his way through locals. Secondly, on a negative note, the film feels short because it felt like the final, inevitable showdown between Laurie and Michael was slightly anti-climatic and devoid of a satisfying end, it felt like there was more to go. Although if the reports of the ending being changed due to the unexpected popularity and interest in the revived series is true (and it certainly seems so when you re-watch early trailers) then I can at least understand why it went down the way it did.The fan service is great. I turned to my girlfriend in the cinema and got all giddy as soon as the original score hit and the pumpkin started to inflate and I exclaimed ""they're using the same font as the original!"" to which my girlfriend called me the biggest geek on the planet. All the callbacks through out the film to previous entries are well placed, there for fans to dissect without alienating the casual film fan. Another example is Laurie's grand-daughter being revealed to be in a relationship with the son of Lonnie from the 1978 movie in a throwaway line at the dinner table. That made me smile and alerted me to look out for more as the film went on but to people getting their first taste of a Halloween movie without any prior knowledge, it's a simple sentence that builds the character up a bit more.There are 3 scenes that could arguably be considered the best. Personally, I love the garage/bathroom murder. An obvious call back to H20 and building tension of showing Michael lurking in the plain sight and seeing glimpses off him through the gap in a bathroom stalls door before the brutal assault and grand ""re-masking"" finish. The other 2 scenes would be the over-the-shoulder tracking shot of Michael going house to house, which is a masterpiece from a technical standpoint, and the scene where Laurie sees Michael in the mirror before Hawkins chases after him.The most divisive thing about this movie seems to be the character of Dr Sartain. Now, I saw his turn coming from a mile away. As soon as Laurie said ""you're the new Loomis?"", I was convinced he was destined to be evil or twisted. Because nobody can be the new Loomis. And as I said to my girlfriend, ""he even has villainous eyebrows"". Some people hated the turn. And I mean, REALLY hated it. Most of the arguments seem to be about how unwarranted it was and how he took out a really good character in Hawkins in the process. But we never really knew enough about Sartain prior to the film to say that it's unwarranted so I don't understand that argument. He's a man who spent 40years taking care of a psychopath, obsessed with hearing him speak. All the evidence was there. I'd love to ask David Gordon Green if Sartain was intentionally written as a reflection of the fanbase. In the way that the good doctor has cared for and maintained this killer for all these years, pouring over his motivations in the same way Halloween fans have discussed Michael in real life. ""Should Michael be supernatural or would that ruin it?"" ""What would Michael say, can he even speak?"" ""What drives him?"" - all questions a Halloween fan has spent hours discussing with others. And then Sartain is responsible for his escape... And again, mirroring the fanbase since it was their love of this evil figure which saw this film be made in the first place. And what does Sartain get for his troubles? The most gruesome kill in the film. So when I think about Sartain as a metaphysical representation of the hardcore fans, I can't be mad at how his role in the film went. It didn't make me angry at the film or change my opinion of the quality of the movie.There's some brilliant cinematography, it feels like a seasonal film for the right reasons. The cast are fantastic, Jamie Lee Curtis ruling as per usual. I would have liked to see more of Judy Greet but I may get my wish with the sequels coming.Special mention for the score, Carpenter again delivers and it's one of the movies strongest traits. It's always building and when Alison is chased by Michael for the first time, I got goosebumps from the music, an original piece as opposed to the iconic Myers theme. A brave, bold move that paid off.Overall, I give the film an 8. It would have been higher had it not fell flat at the end but again, sequels need to be made and the Shape needs to live on. Long may it continue, I say.",Halloween
1337,patpiw,He's Back! A Great addition,9,4 November 2019,"Michael Myers is back, so you better watch out! Halloween (2018) by David Gordon Green is an amazing addition to this great legacy that John Carpenter began. Bring back Jamie Lee Curtis not only gives it the authentic feel from the original and not just a typical addition to a legacy with a whole new cast. This production was done very well with the different aspects of camera angles, lighting, sound, editing, and camera movement. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat during the whole movie with the non-diegetic music that was used. Every time something was about to happen the leitmotif that is heard throughout the whole movie with Michael Myers is played which makes the audience understand something is about to happen. The use of the different camera angles as well as movement was done to not only show the story through some people point of view but also the horror of this movie. The man responsible for this amazing work is credited to the cinematographer, Michael Simmonds. The use of a steady cam as well as a dolly were used in a fantastic way. The use of a handheld cam is used also though which give the movie a feel of realism because the audience almost feels like they are there watching. The use of the dolly though was done very well to follow some characters in a smooth way to not distract the audience. This movie is a masterpiece in my personal opinion due to the fact that one does not see Michael Myers face at all during the movie and only see him lower half of his body or him in the iconic mask. When seeing his mask, one does not see his face behind it or his eyes which makes it almost seem like he is not human. This is done by the lighting which was done also very well in the movie. The movie is not recommended for people who do not deal with blood due to the fact there are a lot of murders.",Halloween
1338,seanpcarey-48035,"Halloween 2018 is scary, funny, and a great film",9,3 November 2019,"Halloween (2018), directed by David Gordon Green, is another installment of the 1978 John Carpenter 's brilliant slasher movie franchise of the Mike Myers and Laurie Strode horror film Halloween. The 2018 film is a great production. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat in horror fashion style and at the same time makes attempts at comedy, which is a little confusing. The cinematographer, Michael Simmonds, uses many typical angles and slow pans. The film uses special effects for blood/gore and lighting to tell the story with many handheld and steady cam shots. The lighting on the white mask on serial killer Mike Myers with deep black eyes is always well done. The sound of the film has an incredibly high-quality music score and is a production of its own keeping the audience in suspense during the scenes and carried most of the film. The editor, Tim Alverson, is nothing short of brilliant, bringing all the elements together of sight and sound to show violence of a serial killer. The actors of the film poke fun at all the typical horror scenes but did a great job in their roles and finally Jamie Lee Curtis is a seasoned veteran and great actress.
Overall, Halloween (2018), it is a great blood filled, horror, slasher movie in the theme of Mike Myers and Laurie Strode. The film is guaranteed to scare the viewer and at times make them laugh. I rate it 9/10 because I didn't know if I was supposed to laugh or be scared.",Halloween
1339,chanonpenvari,"Great acting, average plot",8,4 November 2019,"This film is not a remake film of Halloween 1978, this is the story that taking place 40 years after. Since Micheal Myers was first introduced in Halloween (1978), Micheal Myers become one of the most iconic serial killers of all time. As I mentioned before, Halloween's (2018) timeline is 40 years after the first Halloween (1978), which means Micheal Myers only has killed five people and Laurie Strode and Micheal Myers are not a sibling. Micheal Myers in Halloween (2018) is hungry for blood after being locked up in the hospital for 40 years. Halloween (2018) uses a lot of closes up shots that make the viewer felt uncomfortable and a long take scene that fulfills thrilling and beauty. In Halloween (1978), Micheal Myers's signature act was standing still in the background waiting patiently for the right time to execution. For this scene, the director usually uses rack focus to increase the excitement for the viewer when they sees Micheal Myers blur in the background then disappear. The negative side in the film is that there is excitement but many of them can be predictable. There was not a lot of change from Halloween 1978 and there are multiple scene that does not make sense. For example, Laurie Strode was preparing for 40 years for this moment but when its time to kill Micheal Myers, she chooses to burn him alive. I was expecting some more action such as an explosion or more action between Laurie Strode and Micheal Myers. One of my favorite scenes from this film is the long take scene. In this scene, the camera movement uses a steady cam and attraction shot following Michael movement. During this long-take scene, there is a time when the camera went the opposite direction from Micheal to create a german expression shot, showing Micheal shadow walking by and prepare for execution. Lastly, I believe most of the people who watched this film assume Micheal Myers has died from burning alive. But I don't think so, right at the end of post-credit when the music ended, if you listen carefully to background noise, you can hear that Micheal Myers is still breathing. So the big question is, Is Micheal Myer dead? We'll have to wait and see what will happen next.",Halloween
1340,edgarjvallejo,great addition to the series,9,4 November 2019,"Halloween (2018) is a great addition to the Halloween movies. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the film with some unexpected twists and turns. Throughout this film you see the true nature of this unstoppable being which is a person just like us who had a childhood just like us but somewhere along the line he became the monster he is today in this film. It is never explained what makes him into such a vicious murderer but his doctor who becomes obsessed with him murders someone while using his mask and it appears he will become something similar to Michael because he describes the thrill of murder and thinks he understands why Michael does what he does but Michael is a monster of his own kind. He does not discriminate he kills anyone and everyone without any apparent motive and shows dedication to the killing. When he sets out to kill, he will not stop until they are dead. The movie uses a lot of lite motif following Michael which has become one of the simplest yet most recognized sounds from film throughout the years and it is used throughout the film foreshadowing the presence of evil and murder when Michael is around. It is also used to keep the audience on edge, so they do not know when to expect the next kill. They also use a lot of low lighting which is a common thing in horror movies and side lighting or backlighting on Michael to give him a more sinister appearance. overall the film is greatly put together and has a great storyline to it with twists and turns to keep you on edge and keeps you wondering if this could ever happen in real life or if someone you know could become like this.",Halloween
1341,salmanalajmiusa,Halloween 2018,6,4 November 2019,"Halloween 2018 is a horror movie that picks up 40 years after the 1978 killings that shook the town of Haddonfield, Illinois. As far back as Laurie Strode survived the Boogeyman's fury, she's been preparing her daughter Karen for Michael Myers to escape psychiatric care and get his revenge. Laurie's house is equipped with trap doors and it is very well lighted. Honestly, I believe that this movie was made for the fans of the original Halloween movie. On the other hand, I do not think the movie used a clever logic because there were things that were not well matched. For example, Laurie has a house full of trap doors and a hideout room but she did not think of the easily shattered glass windows that the house has. Also, the narrative story was pushed too hard so that they get to the end where Laurie and her daughters fight Michael.Overall, the movie was great in terms of sounds, camera angles, and lightning. First, the movie used a lot of non-diegetic sound and silence which was the main sound of Michael Myers. Also, we witnessed a great work on camera angles. For example, whenever Michael Myers was on screen, we saw him through a low angle camera to make the audience feels weak and insignificant. Also, we saw some close-up shots to show us how scared the victims were when they sensed someone was behind them. lastly, lighting was mostly low key which is something very common for horror films.",Halloween
1342,arhamkhan-69543,Badass Jamie Lee Curtis,9,4 November 2019,"Halloween (2018) was a sequel to the original Halloween. The movie was directed by David Green. This movie showed the life of Laurie after 40 years with her granddaughter. It really showed the psychology of the character as at the end of the original Halloween we thought how lucky Laurie was to have survived, but really she wasn't that lucky. She was left with this huge fear that the boogie man is coming back for her. She was so stressed that he was going to come back she spent her whole life waiting and practicing to be a killing machine. She raised her daughter in this fear as well and eventually lost her to child services which is a sad realization that even though at the end of the original movie we think she is going to be ok in reality she is just so messed up from the experiences. These experiences give her the experience to be able to protect her family, and she is able to help them survive in the end.Horror movies are made scary by the non-diegetic music in the background which increase anxiety over the character's future. Good horror movies put the music in so well the audience does not even realize that they are doing this. This movie was no different- the music was laced throughout the movie perfectly to keep the audience in suspense. There was high key lighting on Michaels face in scenes where he was the main focus. Overall, the movie quenches the audiences's thirst for action in this movie portraying a badass female lead.",Halloween
1343,kasandravelasco-99486,Halloween,9,6 November 2019,"""You must be ready for him... If you don't, it's your funeral"". Halloween 1978 by John Carpenter set the stage putting Halloween as a top thriller movie by creating a serial killer that will make you think always remember, but the sequel of David Gordon Green is what is making the legacy of Halloween live on. The way David Gordon Green continue the story line with the iconic Jaime Lee Curtis to play her role as Laurie Strode is what made the movie be what it is. The director uses many difference angles to draw in the audience, the use of the camera through Michael mask is an iconic touch from the original film which gives us as the audience to place our selves in Michael shoes. The use of a handheld camera is what horror films are all about, because it gives a touch of realism allowing us to feel like we are living through it. The creepy non diegetic music that is used to let us know Michael is around and its not going to be a happy ending is what adds suspense to the movie, the music in my opinion is what has made Halloween so iconic even till this day. In the film there are a lot of mise-en-scene, one major mise-en-scene is Michael Myers mask, his mask is what allows us to know he is not human he is an evil thing that we never want to encounter. Another mise-en-scene is the knife, the knife is the iconic choice of weapon for Myers as its used in both the older and newer film. The use of the knife is what gives the touch to the film as a slasher film. Overall, I rate this film a 9/10.",Halloween
1344,matthewhardin,Must see!!!,8,4 November 2019,"Halloween (2018)The famous and notorious Michael Meyers is back, and this time is seeking blood and revenge as he is been held captive for the last 40 years. This time it is displayed in the film Halloween (2018) directed by David Gordon Green. Before watching this film, I was very eager, as well as nervous for the reboot of the Halloween franchise. I was very pleased as the film wasn't just a remake of the original Halloween (1978), but instead takes place 40 years later. This is an untold story and completely resets the timeline for lovers of the franchise of Halloweens. This film continues with the reputation of being an 80's slasher movie but incorporates modern techniques to enhance the audiences experience. There is a remarkable blend of comedy, horror, and suspense throughout the film that reveals a lot of unanswered questions from the original film. My personal favorite aspect from the film, is the evolution of the character of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Seeing her character again is a complete 180 difference, as she has been training since the end of the last film for her next encounter with Michael Meyers. She has become a complete Marksman and will not rest until her mission is complete. Another overlooked feature of the film deals with the work of the Cinematographer Michael Simmonds, who utilized camera angles to never allow the audience to see his actual face. This film offers so many connections from the original, and as a result is a must see for any fan of horror films.As a result, Halloween (2018) was a phenomenal film that incorporated comedy, horror and suspense in a perfect mixture. Personally, I am a big fan of horror films containing bits of comedy, but not so much that it takes away from the horror aspect. So, I rate this film an 8/10 as I believe there was almost too many elements of comedy and not enough horror. But overall a fantastic film and a must see for anyone who has viewed the original Halloween!",Halloween
1345,lucy-clark-99653,Halloween,7,4 November 2019,"History begins to repeat itself in the thrilling remake of Halloween, the 2018 version. The gorey horror is one of the most brutally graphic films I have ever seen, making it the critically acclaimed film it is. Michael Myers is made to look inhumane by the use of the famous mask. The cinematographer, Michael Simmonds, does an excellent job with the mis-en-scene by the use of the mask and the camera angles of never showing his face. This method was a perfect way to show how his brutal urge to kill innocent people takes away his humanity. Another key aspect to the film is the sound and music. The constant leitmotifs originally used by John Carpenter creates a sense of fear knowing that every time you hear the high pitch ringing, you know Michael Myers is about to appear and cause evil. As well as leitmotifs, David Gordon Green uses the motifs of the famous knife from the original film. The use of the knife overlaps into the comment that Dave (played by Miles Robbins) says mentioning how a few deaths with a knife is a norm in today's society. David Gordon Green does an excellent job of differentiating this Halloween from all of the other horror films. I rate this film 7/10 and would highly recommend to fans of the horror genre.",Halloween
1346,shermanmclawhorn,A Worthy Sequel (SPOILERS),8,4 November 2019,"Re-makes, or sequels of classic Hollywood films, typically fall short of the original and do not give the audience the same sense of satisfaction. However, the 2018 installment of Halloween directed by David Gordon Green, lives up to the legendary status of the original film that we all know and love. The film is not only about the terrors that Michael Myers, or the boogeyman, causes against Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, and the rest of the town, but also about the struggles they face as a family. Laurie is forced to be absent from her granddaughter's life because her daughter, Karen, believes she is a bad influence on her due to her neurosis and obsession with Michael. Laurie tries to explain how everything she has done was for her own good and to prepare her for Michael's return. This makes them divided as a family and also makes it the perfect time for the boogyeman to strike.Speaking of the boogeyman, Michael Myers, played by Nick Castle, was portrayed perfectly in this film. Even though we are accustomed to the use of suspenseful music, such as in Jaws as well as the original Halloween, it still has the same affect whenever Michael appears on screen. There are two things that are kept from the audience when it comes to Michael Myers. Those two things are his face and his voice. He does not utter a single word during the film and while you get glimpses of the side of his face from time to time, we never actually see what his face looks like. They only use a straight on angle when he is wearing the mask. This is done because Michael is not supposed to be a human who murders people, he is the embodiment of evil. Evil does not have a voice, it does not have a face, you cannot reason with it, and you cannot make sense out of it.",Halloween
1347,dinanashed,A thrilling experience!,8,4 November 2019,"Forty years later and the remake of Halloween is just as thrilling as the original. In 2018, the story of Laurie Strode versus Michael Meyers continues under the director David Gordon Green. Laurie lived in constant fear and paranoia which has caused her to lose connection with her daughter who did not believe the reality of her fear. After he escapes prison, Michael Meyers did what he is best at by continuing to kill until he reaches his target of the Strode family residence. All events throughout the movie were fast-paced and kept the audience intrigued the entire time through the changes of camera angles and the use of handheld cameras. The eerie non-diegetic music completes the tone of the entire movie because the music that signifies that Michael is unchanged and becomes a staple associated with his character. Because the characters are unaware that the music is occurring, they are also unaware of the danger that is about to face them. This also makes the audience feel on edge because they feel helpless that they are unable to aid them. A motif that is a crucial part of this movie is Michael's knife that he uses to kill all his victims. It's a symbol of his evil and destructive nature. A difference between this movie and the original is the visibility of blood. Though both movies have a violent nature, what distinguishes the newer version is the blood that is shown several times throughout, and it was stated that not a drop of blood was shown in the original movie. Overall, the movie is a thrilling sequel to the original Halloween (1978) that I would rate as an 8/10 due to its impressive ability to keep the audience engaged throughout the entire experience.",Halloween
1348,ceciliajuarez-55831,Not a complete fail,6,4 November 2019,"* warning: spoilersIn Halloween (2018), the Jamie Lee Curtis steps back into her role as Laurie Strode as she faces Michael Myers for a second and final time since she narrowly avoided becoming one of his victims forty years ago. Having seen the original, Halloween (1978), I expected another spectacular thriller but I'm not exactly sure that director David Gordon Green delivered just that. Regardless, I think that Cinematographer Michael Simmonds and the sound production crew did a great job of creating suspense in this film through the lighting, camera movements and angles, music, and sound.
One of the scenes that stood out to me is when Michael Myers is reunited with his mask because I feel like it marks his official return. Up until this moment we never get a straight-on medium shot of Myers. The purpose of this may be to keep his identity a mystery or maybe it's because he doesn't have an identity without his mask. In other words, without his mask, he is insignificant.
What I enjoyed most about this film was the way that Laurie Strode was portrayed, its evident that she is no longer the fragile and vulnerable woman she was four decades ago. Although she was left paranoid, she is now more prepared than ever to take on and defeat Myers once and for all. We realize this as we see a montage of her handling her guns like a badass after she's learned of Myers escape. Another thing that I liked about Halloween (2018) was how it had a few call backs to the original. Specifically, when Laurie falls off of the balcony we see Myers looking down at her body on the ground, he looks away for a few seconds and then she is gone. In the original, the same thing happened except with Myers on the ground, apparently defeated and from one shot to the next, he was gone.
What bothered me most in this film was that unnecessary humor was thrown in every now and then. While it was somewhat funny I feel like humor shouldn't be mixed in with a horror movie because I'm not looking for a moment of relief, I want to feel anxious and be constantly on the edge of my seat.
Overall, I am rating this film a 6/10 because I think that certain parts of it have great potential but then again, there are other parts that just don't make sense.",Halloween
1349,lukemickelsonflight,Valiant Effort,6,4 November 2019,"David Green's Halloween (2018) was a revival of the fabled Halloween (1978) directed by John Carpenter. Attempting to follow such a distinguished film can be a daunting task no doubt, and although Green made a valiant effort I believe this film falls short of expectations. Green's Halloween ignores all other sequels and presents us with a forty year gap between the original. As such all of tension and stress has been continuously bottled and building pressure. This creates some interesting character arcs specifically in Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who has been preparing for the inevitable. Curtis's performance is one of the few enjoyable aspects of the film and I am glad they included the same actress with the character from the original. The tough female lead takes Michael (Nick Castle) on in a battle of wits on her part and overwhelming brute force from him. Considering that these characters have been harboring feelings for more than forty years the completion of their story arc must be astounding and without giving spoilers I again think the film falls short on this account.
Acting aside there were some other aspects that carried over from the original including shots, lighting, atmosphere and my favorite the sound motif. The soundtrack is another saving grace of the film and Michael Simmonds utilized it to great effect. Constantly keeping the audience on their toes, never sure when Michael is about to commit a murder as we follow a trail of twists and turns, sounds were used to exceptional effect throughout the film. However, as much as I wanted to enjoy the film it just felt too much like a cheap remake for me to be too impressed. Recycled shots and scenes, poor acting (save Curtis), and an unsatisfying ending were not enough for me and the expectation I came in with.",Halloween
1350,paigeksmith-99994,Halloween,8,4 November 2019,"The camerawork of this film was excellent, as well as its use of music and the themes in the film. This slasher had some scenes that were cringe-worthy, but I still believe the overall scary part of the entire series is that it takes place in suburbia, Illinois and literally follows you home. It takes place where many of us live, and since Michael is unstoppable, there seems to be no escape.
The camera angles constantly show the victim before Michael arrives, the victim's point of view as he enters the room, the view of his weapon and then the slashing. When the audience first sees dead bodies in the scene, the audience expects to find Michael or his next victim. The camera from inside the mask mirrored the original film so the victims could be seen literally from Michael's eyes. This is crucial to the film because it makes the audience empathize with the victims while putting us in Michael's shoes. The camera also was crucial in portraying the shape, or Michael's shadow, that was repeatedly shown throughout the film. This is important because it adds to the suspense of the film.
Music added to the suspense of the film but also foreshadowed Michael's presence. I love how the theme song is so simple but everyone can identify it right away. Even if someone hasn't seen the film, they have undoubtedly heard the song and immediately associate it with Halloween. The music is part of the film that made it so iconic because it prepares the viewers for a frightening scene, which scares them even more.
The themes in the film are relevant to today's society. One was the theme of feminism. Laurie Strode single handedly knows how to fight and how to save her family. Men in this film are shown as officers, detectives, doctors and husbands/boyfriends, but none of them stop Michael or protect the people. The film showed Laurie in a light of strength and power and it really emphasized her intelligence. While many characters in the film say Laurie is paranoid, I think it is actually an instinct. Laurie's gut feeling shows that she is cautious and prepared for any horrific event involving her safety. Michael left an everlasting scar on Laurie after her friends were tragically murdered.",Halloween
1351,justineszaflarski,I expected a little too much...,5,4 November 2019,"I give this movie a 5/10. Being a big fan of the 1978 version, I came into watching this movie expecting amazing. It was a little underwhelming due to the many plot holes I could not avoid. Michael's classic slow walk/never getting hurt was a little dramatic in this movie. There were so many instances where Michael could've been caught/killed. I know this is only a movie, but it is just impossible. Another hole was when the reporters came to visit Michael in the asylum, no one in their right mind would allow that kind of thing to happen. They were screaming at him and no police department would hand over Michael's iconic mask to random reporters. Having SUCH a scary, and mentally ill individual being transported on a bus with hardly any security at all would never happen.
I did not hate the movie, but this was so anticipated and the advertising was phenomenal, so I just expected more.
Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job, acting like an ""insane/paranoid"" grandmother, and I'm glad all the original cast members were in this film. BUT she had 40 years to prepare for this, and her house looked so cool, so prepared, and all of her guns were on display, but when Michael got there, I felt like so many of her decisions were stupid. Her house is not all that big and having all those mannequins that look like Michael was just awful. I felt like I was getting less scared due to her stupid decisions.
I am a huge fan of horror films, so this just did not top it for me. It was good blend of suspense and comedy, and the film wasn't the worst... I just think for such a franchise, it should have been fantastic.",Halloween
1352,halimaxoxo,Halloween,4,4 November 2019,"I personally don't enjoy the horror genre but this film wasn't too bad. I really enjoyed how this film made me laugh but also made me scared for what was to come. Michael is a merciless killer without a motive. This particular element made the film even scarier to watch because it made the audience question their own lives and how something random like this can occur at any moment.One element of the film that added to the horror was the addition of blood and showing the actual scenes of death. The original film did not show any blood but still had the ability to scare the audience. However, in this day in age, it would be extremely difficult to make a horror film that impacted the audience without showcasing any blood or gore in the film. The other aspect of the film that stood out to me was the ability of the filmmaker to make you cringe at your seat while looking at the death scenes. Before watching the film, I wouldn't have thought of half of these ways to die.The scariest part of the movie was seeing Michael murder people without any sort of prior skills or having any type of real weapon. He relies on household items that are seemingly found anywhere.I didn't LOVE the movie but I did like it. It wasn't something that I would go towards but I enjoyed watching it once. I found the film to be very underwhelming and funny when it shouldn't have been funny. This may have been more scary in the past but with everything going on in the world, this wasn't something that I would be that terrified of.",Halloween
1353,asmaticc,Great sequel!,8,4 November 2019,"Halloween (2018) which was directed by David Gordon Green was a sequel to the original Halloween from 1978 which was directed by John Carpenter. The original one set the stage for this one and I am so glad it was made. As a viewer, i was curious to know what happened to both Micheal Myers and Laurie. Watching Jamie Lee Curtis play her role again was a truly iconic moment in film history because it is not always possible to get the original actors for sequels like this. Although I felt the plot was overdone and not that scary, it was still an excellent film! I enjoyed the use of the original music to signify Micheal Myers coming as a leitmotif. Overall, this cinematic experience was done well and showed a contemporary point of view of what the future for Laurie and Micheal Myer's looked like. In the original film I wanted more information on Micheal and his mental health, and I believe this film somewhat satisfied my curiosity for what was wrong with him. The director's misc-en-scene of Laurie's home was incredible as you were unable to tell at first glance the craziness which she had locked away. I thought the scene of her granddaughter running through the woods and through the shooting range was done very well and had a scare factor tacked onto it. The gore and blood added a good element of how ruthless Micheal is despite all the years he was locked up. Overall, it was a good movie and worth watching.",Halloween
1354,kaileycparnello,Halloween Review,8,5 November 2019,"David Gordon Green's 2018 film, Halloween, is a thrilling horror production that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film's use of non diegetic sounds allow for intense suspense. Halloween uses low lighting throughout the film to perfectly portray the darkness of Micheal Myers. You learn very quickly that for Micheal Myers second escape no one is safe. Even as his victims scream for him to spare their lives, Micheal still shows no emotion and never speaks a single word. In the film, Micheal's face is never shown. This adds suspense to the audience and the character within the film trying to figure out who this monster really his. People within the film start to go crazy just trying to understand why Micheal kills so ruthlessly.
In this production of Halloween, after 40 years of waiting Micheal Myer escapes and has come back for Laurie Strode. This time, however, Laurie is ready for him. Laurie is portrayed as a paranoid individual, who has surrounded her life around preparing for this moment. This preparation, however, has come at the cost of hurting the relationships with her daughter and granddaughter. As an audience you start to empathize with Laurie because you know that she is not crazy but actually well prepared for what is to come. When Micheal and Laurie finally meet again, it is filled with action and suspense. This is shown through the editing of this film that creates a heart racing thriller with its uses of fast cuts. As the film concludes, Green's use of a high angle shot with Micheal looking up at Laurie and a cut to a low angle shot of Laurie looking down at Micheal shows the power the Laurie has gained over someone the once caused great fear and chaos to her life.",Halloween
1355,rossmccormick-35396,Great Film,8,6 November 2019,"David Green's Halloween (2018) Is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. His ability to create fear and suspense basically from every cinematic aspect is incredible. He uses specific music, lighting, camera angles, and many more aspects to completely capture the darkness of Michael Meyers. Even without the visual representation of Michael Meyers on screen we feel his presence with the high pitched piano play. This non diegetic sound alerts the audience that Michael Meyers is lurking and able to viscously kill whoever crosses in his path. Green is able to depict the chaos that the town is going through. The piano melody that is heard when Meyers is present is in 5-4. This doesn't contain a typical rhythmic appeal. This non typical pattern is used to show how unhinged Michael Meyers is and what grave danger anyone in the town is in. There is many moving shots in the film to show the chaos and how unsettling the night will become. The dark lighting and shadows add to these shots to create suspense about when Meyers will strike.John Carpenter's (1978) Halloween displays the immense horror of Meyers by showing us his one goal was to kill. His psychopath tendencies are brought out because he didn't set out to kill anyone specifically. He would just kill whoever got in his way. David Green's Halloween develops more of a story between with the unfinished business of Meyers and Laurie Strode. It is fate that continues to draw the two together. Meyers last interaction with Laurie completely transformed her into devoting her life to stopping the monster at hand. I rate this film a 8/10. The energy and creepiness that Green showed in the film was showed his mastery as a director. He creates actual fear within audiences through simple strategies.",Halloween
1356,rimasfaruki,Finally a decent Halloween Film again,7,29 October 2019,The reason for the title of this review is because as well as loving John Carpenter's Original I liked 1981's Halloween II except for the subplot of Laurie Strode being implied as Michael Myers' sister that was really unnecessary and cliched but they squash that anyway in this film which is why I wish this Halloween was more of a sequel to Halloween II. By all means this film is not perfect but a far better Halloween Film than 4-6 & the bloody awful Resurrection (H20 was not too bad but it's gotta go too for continuity). Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as this version of Laurie Strode with that survivalist/Sarah Connor vibe. I'm so glad Nick Castle returned as The Shape despite never having any dialogue his performances as Michael Myers in his movements and kill scenes say so much more about the character which he conveys the best. Will Patton is always the best go to for playing Deputy's and authority figures in films such as these and in this one he does not disappoint. Judy Greer was very believable like she could be JLC's daughter in real life too. I wasn't so sure about the younger new actors of the cast but I guess we see what happens with them (the ones that lived) in Halloween Kills. Now for the questionable to bad parts: The Doctor wearing Michael's mask was the one cheesy scene they could have done without and the scenes with the two English crime podcasters speaking as an Englishman myself was cringe worthy and the only good thing about them is when they are finally killed. Is this film overhyped like some reviewers have said maybe but not as awful as many have made out. Overall I would recommend this film especially for fans of the first 2 Halloweens who hated the other sequels that came after those films (Although I personally place Season of the Witch as it's own standalone film and ignore the Halloween III top title that accompanies it as it's a pretty good story by itself which I wish they would also rectify). I give this a good!,Halloween
1357,keoseyan-66002,No better than any of the other sequels it attempted to blow out of the water.,6,19 November 2019,"Short Take: Despite some good scenes here and there as well as a compelling showdown between the main characters and convincing acting by the lead, this movie falls tragically short of what it attempted to do, which was recreate the glory of the original Halloween and become a solid conclusion to the Saga. Basically, I would consider it no better than any of the sequels it attempted to blow out of the water.
Review: While being a long time fan of the franchise and an expert on the Halloween movie series I certainly enjoyed watching this film, as I have mostly every single one in the series (despite how bad some are), this movie is among the worst ever in the entire saga of Halloween pictures.
Certainly better than either of Rob Zombie's films, but of roughly the same quality of Halloween 5 and 6, Halloween fails to do what it set out to do, which was become a solid sequel of the original one.
While I certainly commend the filmmakers for attempting to create a sequel that would be superior to all the ones ever made and to drift away from the genuine pieces of garbage that were Rob Zombie's films, the reality is that their attempt falls tragically short.
Despite some good scenes here and there, particularly the one of the murder of the drunk kid in the grounds of a mansion, as well as that in the Hospital when Michael is presented his mask, as well as the personal vendetta the sheriff has against Michael, as well as creating a heroine that, for the first time in all Halloween films, is a genuine foe to Michael Myers and provides an actual strong and worthy adversary, and a masterful acting job by Jamie Lee Curtis (particularly portraying someone who suffers from PTSD) the movie has a lot more negative aspects than it does positive.
In terms of characters, there is no development whatsoever. Aside from Laurie Strode, whom we know from other movies, all the characters are simply flat. The pathetic attempt for a new Dr. Loomis fails miserably and angers the viewer, as his rudimentary attempts at a revolutionary psychiatric treatment are straight out of fantasyland. The three generations of Michael Myers hunters (except for Laurie) is also completely lifeless and dull, and the sherriff, who seems to be the only characters genuinely motivated to stop Myers out of sheer virtue and righteousness, is not given enough time to become the hero he deserves to be due to a stupid plot twist that leaves the viewer shaking his head in total negligence for the screenwriter and director, who did everything to shoot themselves in the foot.
Structurally, the film is poorly paced. Aside from the fact the whole shenanigan regarding the investigative journalists takes up a good chunk of screen time via a set up that is simply too long to create and could have been used in a much better way, the suspense is simply underwhelming. Of course, there are points where you do feel on the edge of your seat, but those points fail to climax, and all one can feel is frustration. Repeatedly, through the movie, you see scenes in which you naturally expect something bombastic to happen, but it never really does, therefore, you feel empty and wondering when the hell something worthwhile will happen.
Furthermore, the movie is so poorly paced that it feels as though there is no second act. There is only a long first act and a short third act in which the victim and victimizer confront each other for yet another cliché Halloween ending. Of course, it's nice for the Killer to be set up in a trap, but there are so many plot holes in that final showdown, such as questions like
Why didn't Laurie Strode truly fortify her cage?"" and ""Why doesn't she just shoot him with a hand grenade?"" that it too, is ultimately unsatisfying.
In addition, some of the supporting characters are so pathetic that you're almost glad when Michael wipes them away. The movie fails to do anything it anticipated, desired, or planned, and while there are some worthy scenes, the reality is that it fails, and that it does so miserably. To be honest, the movie trailer promised a film that was not delivered.",Halloween

1364,TheeMovieeGuyy,Michael came home,10,17 October 2021,"Listen, as much as there are negative reviews, there are also the positive ones. Halloween kills in my opinion was fantastic. Was it cheesy at some points? Sure. Was it predictable at times? Of course. However over all I think it was exactly what I needed. Here's why.From the original in 78, Michael Meyers was this shape, this being driven by evil, a machine. In the franchise he's been shot, stabbed, hung, ran over, drowned, blown up, crushed, and burned...yet he doesn't die. You can't kill him, and that is what makes him an iconic slasher. His motive is purely evil, and feeds on the fear of his victims. As much as people try to have stopped him, he continues to emerge from the ashesLet's get back to this movie....
Halloween kills was awesome. From the opening scenes, Michael showed us why he is the all time great slasher. Through out the whole movie, whenever someone came across his path they knew...they knew they were in the presence of evil. The flashbacks and Easter eggs i thought were awesome, and the back drop of us finding out why he came back home was interesting.We kinda knew that Laurie was going to be in the hospital based on Halloween 2. I think that it would have been poor planning to have her go toe to toe with MM badly wounded. The story is more of a massacre party this time around and very gory. MM is a true badass in this one. One of my favorite scenes was when the town mob caught up to him and had the showdown they all wanted...and the ending they all feared. Remember previously in Halloween they did touch on angry mob, but didn't dive to much into it. Now, this time they all banned together to take on the beast. Was this scene predictable at times? Yes, but over all was a staple in the series. The towns people came face to face with the monster who had terrorized their town 40 something years ago before that night. They thought they had finally taken him down, just to be decimated by the man they call Michael.The ending, well I won't go into that and totally spoil it but I think was very interesting. The iconic window scene, the location where it all went down, where it all started....it definitely sets up for next years move Halloween ends.End.",Halloween

I was willing to play along with the whole ""we're hitting the reset button and pretending Halloween II through Halloween: Resurrection never happened"" bit... but the filmmakers totally let me down. I'm baffled by the fact this was produced by Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter. WHAT??!! Did they just need a paycheck? Because that's what this film felt like. This film felt like not just an insult to the franchise, but an insult to the genre as a whole. I still can't tell you who the main character was... maybe Jamie Lee Curtis? Maybe Judy Greer (why was she even in this film)? Maybe the granddaughter? The script was like they took three different scripts and a whole bunch of catch phrases and just threw them into a blender. I'm mostly upset with the other horror buffs in my news feed who have posted about seeing this film not once, not twice, but three times. I'm seriously baffled by the fact you think this is quality film making. I've taken film classes with some of you. This goes against everything we were taught and is an insult to our degrees. Shame on John Carpenter. SHAME ON JAMIE LEE CURTIS. And shame on you for making me believe that they were successfully resurrecting THE SHAPE for one final installment.

The directors of all the Halloween franchises seem to miss the blindingly obvious, Halloween had one thing that set it apart from all other horrors, suspense and atmosphere. The original obviously had an easier audience to cater for, more naive and less exposed to violence in general.
What really made the original so creepy and original was that Myers was scarce throughout and even when he did appear you mostly saw brief flashes with heavy breathing. This cause d the viewer to imagine where Myers was and heightened suspense. The latest iteration takes away the mystique of Myers, far to many moments with Michael.
The plot was thin on the ground as was the direction. There were moments where the film almost achieves the sense of intimidation of the original only to be lost by overindulgence.
The presence of the original film will loom large over any subsequent attempt at recreation. However, what really made the original effective was the fact nothing looked manufactured, Haddonfield looked like a real town that even if you had never visited America you could imagine really could exist.
The modern take on Halloween just oozes to much ""Hollywood"" production values, unrealistic actors, unbelievable storylines and cinematography that's too polished.
What will it take for another classic to appear? Maybe just everyday homes in an everyday neighbourhood with plain actors and a boogeyman who is always lurking but never quite present.",Halloween

I have been to the theaters three times in the last eight years, to see The Shining in the big screen, Deadpool, and The Dark Knight Rises. I am not a big movie goer. However, I do appreciate good film. I have been a Halloween, Michael Myers fan as long as I can remember. I have appreciated all of the entries to the series but nothing comes close to the original. I refused to watch any spoilers, I saw one preview, and I patiently waited. I am not saying I was disappointed with this movie but I definitely feel like it could have been far better. I hate to be a negative critic but this movie seemed so much like a great sequel, it dragged me out of the house to see it. Spoilers. I absolutely hated how much it focused on Laurie's granddaughter. I absolutely hated how much it focused on building up Laurie's granddaughter's high school. I absolutely hated how the movie felt like it needed twelve characters who had nothing to do with the plot. There were only four characters that I actually cared for; the two journalists, who spend 15 minutes total on screen, Laurie, and of course, Michael. I absolutely hated Laurie's daughter, son in law, and granddaughter, they had no substance or any real reason for being in the movie. I hated the penis jokes. The only ratification for the granddaughter was watching that one kid get killed on a fence. I absolutely loved when Michael when door to door killing people. I loved the opening sequence at the institution. I really loved the journalists and wished they had more time in the movie. I hated the new ""Dr Loomis,"" especially the scene where he put on Michael's mask and jumped up in front of the car. Overall, the movie fell flat. It could seriously be called H40 and it wouldn't bother me. The ending was pretty lame, it would've been cool to see Laurie take Michael on one on one but since she had the help of two characters I didn't care for, it didn't really make me feel anything.

1381,litltingod,"A thoughtless, hollow film with good cinematography",5,21 October 2018,"Last night I was lucky to see an advanced screening of the new Halloween movie. The film is a mixed bag. It's a solid effort and nowhere near the depths of junk food cinema the franchise has sunken to in the past. This is certainly one of the classier entries in the series, and not one any of us should miss. I wholeheartedly endorse anyone and everyone to see this film. Just know that while it tries really hard, it does stumble at times. But that's ok, Michael stumbles all the time. I will remain spoiler free, but I am going to talk about plenty of scenes that we saw in the trailer and to what degree I feel they worked in the movie.The movie opens with the name Maleek Akkad in bright orange letters and I know I'm in for a treat. Before any more credits roll though, the movie cuts to a pair of investigative journalists. They're arriving at a mental health facility to interview Michael Myers, and this scene plays out pretty much as we saw in the trailer. They hold up his mask in the prison yard and all that. Then we're finally given a credits scene, and it was really well done. It opens with a pumpkin (obviously) and what they chose to do with it was really clever. The opening titles get an A+. I think they would have been better in the beginning, before the prison yard scene, but whatever. Then we're back to the journalists. These two characters are ok I guess, but they only exist for two very obvious reasons: 1. Expository dialogue. Lots of it. So much of it. A bit too much maybe. 2. They needed to explain how he obtains the same mask and this is the best thing they could come up with. They conveniently brought it to him for the 40th anniversary of his historic murder spree. It's a bit far-fetched, but whatever. He gets his mask back. Fate, right?Then we're treated to a bizarre number of scenes lifted straight out of other Halloween movies. He's being relocated the night before Halloween. There is a car crash. He escapes. Characters visit a graveyard. Michael finds a gas station. He really hates mechanics. He goes into the bathroom and kills someone in the stall. A character finds everyone in the gas station murdered. Does any of that sound familiar? Well this is all pretty ok because I was honestly having a lot of fun reliving these moments. The film feels a lot like a remake of other Halloween sequels, but it's well made and so I was completely willing to embrace that. I was totally on board and having a great time. There is a family making breakfast and having playful banter as they discuss their plans for Halloween, three girls walking to school, and reimagining of the classroom scene that makes an interesting change. That's when I realized why I didn't mind all of the lifted scenes. Just what are they doing with Laurie's character? They seemed to be going some place really interesting and unexpected, beyond just making her a Sarah Conner character.Laurie Strode completely steals every scene she is in. I can not stress enough just how incredible Jamie Lee Curtis is in this movie. I can compare it to Mark Hamill's incredible performance in The Last Jedi, which was amazing regardless what you thought of the rest of the movie. In each case these actors are giving us their best performances in years. I loved her in this movie, and you really want to root for her. Without giving away anything that wasn't already in trailers, we learn that she is a survivalist living in a fortified home. She has a strained relationship with her daughter, which has distanced her from her granddaughter. One small thing I will share: about halfway through there is an amazing scene where Laurie embarrasses her family in a restaurant, and there was a heartbreaking moment where I wanted to cry for her. Her daughter and son-in-law are talking over her and down to her and yelling at her, while her granddaughter is the only one trying to listen to her. It was great! Characters were yelling but there was also so much non-verbal communication being shared between them. Sadly, these moments don't really lead anywhere because the third act doesn't have time for that kind of character development. By then the movie barrels ahead at break-neck speed, all shotguns and stab wounds. The movie almost does some really cool stuff with Laurie's character. but in the end it's happy with her just being Sarah Conner. It scratches the surface of where this movie could have gone. They almost had Michael escape in a way that would have shocked everyone, but no, it's just the basic car crash. They almost had Laurie do things that were dark and real and tragically relatable, while setting her apart from the basic Sarah Conner/Ellen Ripley mold. But no, they don't.The ride started to change about 80 minutes in. Up until then I was honestly having a really good time still, and ready to give this movie a glowing review. The movie had already fed us enough member berries to put most people into a diabetic coma, even including silly easter eggs that do nothing to serve the film, like the Halloween III masks. But it hadn't done anything to actually damage the film yet. The movie's desire to be a greatest hits of the Halloween franchise jumps the shark when it suddenly reintroduces what was one of the most laughable storylines of the later sequels. I really really want to talk about it but I can't. Lets just say I was left with my jaw dropped because of how monumentally stupid this movie suddenly becomes. It actually made me sad. It's as if he needs to shoehorn in at least one scene from every previous film, even if it makes no sense. And in doing so he needlessly disposes of some really excellent supporting characters that would have been great to have around for sequels. At this point I'm waiting for Busta and the white horse to show up.The movie never recovers after this point. It devolves into an action movie, with Michael breaking into Laurie's fortress. All of the great character development between Laurie and her family is pretty much over. The heroes are all very well armed and prepared, and Michael is always in an equal level of danger that they are. It was epic. It was even funny at times. There just wasn't anything scary about it. It wasn't a chase or a murder, it was a battle royal. It doesn't hold many surprises. It wasn't anywhere near as frightening as the frantic chase scene at the end of the original Halloween II. At one point the movie mimics the famous sit-up scene from the first film, but without proper pacing to let it resonate. There isn't that pause where the audience can see but the hero can't, and we all gasp while the scene builds tension. Here it happens so fast it has absolutely no effect other than to check off another entry on the director's list.One problem with this movie was most on display during a babysitter attack scene about halfway through. We've all seen the scene in the trailer where the babysitter is trying to close the closet door. Instead of long, drawn out, nail-biting suspense, it happens really quickly. The little kid that she's babysitting is hysterically funny, so hysterically funny that the audience laughed throughout the entire scene. This was one of the biggest kill scenes in the movie and the audience laughed from start to finish. For reasons I won't say, the same thing happened at the end of the movie. During the climax the audience was laughing hysterically.As for the rest of the cast, Judy Greer is excellent. She's perfectly cast as Laurie's daughter. Andi Matichak is great. Will Patton and Toby Huss are great. Dylan Arnold was really great and it's a shame the character of Cameron was so underused. Some of the supporting characters are really wonderful but were sadly wasted.Its not a terrible film. It's not a great film. It's not the best this franchise has to offer but it's not the worst. I think Halloween 2 and 4 are both better sequels. In particular I think the original sequel from 1981 does a much better job of building tension. Michael was always hiding behind things, around corners, and on the security cameras. He was like a shark and you never knew when he was going to strike. This movie doesn't really have that same feeling. Instead Michael tends to just kill and then get on with the next one. There is a playful scene using motion lights that could have been great, but here it plays out like some annoying 30 second Facebook video that urges you to turn the sound up and play until the end.The movie is so concerned with giving Laurie her big tough girl moment that it never built up any scares, and dropped the ball on where it could have gone with her character. It's not a movie that takes chances or has any sort of new creative vision. It's just a series of recycled ideas brought to life with really good cinematography. Oh, and they finally got the mask right. I give this movie one thumb up. 👍",Halloween
1382,sierrajo724,Not As Expected,8,19 October 2018,"Let me preface this review by saying Carpenter's 1978 Halloween is my favorite movie of all time. I love all the sequels, but only for the mere fact that they are continuing the legacy of my favorite horror villain. Going into the new movie, I expected more. Michael doesn't even put his mask on for 1/4 of the movie, which I felt made him seem more human, something Dr. Loomis clearly stated he was not. Also, the attempt to replace Dr. Loomis with a less than impressive psychopathic doctor was just a disappoinment. Also, the way they made Laurie seem like a psycho doomsday prepper upset me. I wish they would have let her move on with her life, only for Michael's return to be a surprise. I feel they could have gotten further with that. Overall, the homages to the original series were enough for me to give the film an 8/10. The kills were also all brilliantly done.",Halloween
1383,jo_thomas85,Why?,5,12 November 2018,"I get that this was meant to be a direct sequel to the original... but why? Why did they bother writing a daughter into the story when she already had a son in H2O. This film could've easily been a follow on from that, with characters that we already knew and were familiar with.
I didn't read too much on this before watching, I was just excited for another Halloween film. And when there was no mention of her son, but a daughter, this confused me. To the point I had to google to find out why.
Don't get me wrong the film is ok, not very ""Michael Myers"" though. He seemed more violent bloody murderer than being stealthy and stalking his prey which is what we are used to. A few jumpy bits in the film, but not scary.
Not to mention the pointless teenage storyline, which really didn't belong.
Unfortunately this film didn't blow my mind like I hoped it would.",Halloween

Great return to form for our favourite masked serial killer, makes him seem menacing again, amazing continuation of the original story but still lacking, tries really hard to be more than it is (have you ever known a horror sequel to be greater than its predecessor?) I get the gimmick of ignoring all the previous sequels and appreciate it, tries to be true to the original while also trying to be modern horror, big fail in trying to keep it modern, the whole psychotic doctor was a bit too much for me and made me miss Loomis a whole lot. If you are a Halloween fan there is a lot to enjoy but for the casual viewer and die hard Michael Myeres fan you will be simply enjoying another run of the mill slasher simply in the vein of a guy with a inside our William Shatner mask.",Halloween

Once again, the writers fill in all of the gaps that one may have about why we are here. Again.SPOILER:
I was almost disappointed at the end (as a true fan), that Laurie didn't finish it. She didn't stay to see his ashes. If you keep up with the story, you would know there's nothing that would have kept her from seeing his ashes. So, maybe we will see a 50 yr reunion?

1405,notfol7,Online movie rating systems need a refresh,5,20 October 2018,"I think this movie should fall anywhere between a 3-6/10 depending on your preferences. With a quality writer it could have been bumped up to a 6-7.5, but it never had a chance to be an 8-10.Pros: All of the women's performances were solid, there were some very suspenseful scenes. and the score (music) was enjoyable.Cons: Terrible writing, dumb characters, and sadly the most memorable takeaway from the whole movie is a funny little black kid.To elaborate on the cons:Incredibly poor writing - Here's the things a good writer would have done:1. There would have been a reason why the reporters and Michael both end up at the gas station; not just an utter coincidence. It's not a hard thing to do (i.e. Michael is out of gas, reporters needs some snacks, etc.).Michael has to turn around in the opening scene to know what the reporters look like. Otherwise they're just random people he's slaughtering at the gas station, and would have no idea his mask is in their car.2.The granddaughter's boyfriend would have been completely cut from the movie. He added nothing, he wasn't motivation for anything, and is last seen about halfway through.3.Inappropriate humor would have been removed. The dad is 100% cringe-worthy anytime he talks. There is a humorous line delivered from the little kid as the babysitter is getting brutally murdered in the same room. It's awful. The two cops comedically talking about their lunches right in between dramatic, intense scenes. Why? It's so out of nowhere and a good writer/editor cuts that from the film.Stupid characters/cliches:1.When Michael escapes the cop with the cowboy hat says something like, ""what're we gonna do, cancel Halloween?"" Yes, that's exactly what would happen if a serial killer had gotten lose in the area. The military would be brought in looking for him everywhere.2, When the girl exits the police car she heads straight for the dark woods instead of just running on the road until she finds someone. Remember the villain literally walks 1mph and can't drive a car, it shouldn't be that challenging to get away. He only gets his kills through surprises or trapping people.3. Another cliche instance of character tripping over nothing when the babysitter is trying to escape from Michael. Also, another cliche where character was thought to be dead, camera pans away, pans back and they're not there anymore.If Hollywood wants to keep creating reboots and sequels, fine, but we really should be demanding better quality from them.",Halloween
1406,bolingerross,What a disappointment,4,19 October 2018,"Green is a decent director, but this was a terrible slasher flick. Cheap jump scares, crap character story, random sequences that made NO sense to the main story at all. Maybe I went in to this expecting much more than a sleazy early adult movie that. The worst part was the doctor's character.....why did you have to go there?I mean, this literally had NO STORY whatsoever. No motive from Michael for the killings; he kills random people that are not tied to the main characters at all. WHY?! And the chemistry between the main characters is non-existent.What I did like about this movie is the soundtrack and the final sequence/showdown. That was the most entertaining part of the whole film. Just stinks you had to wait almost 1.5 hours to get there. Acting was...meh. Wasn't terrible, but it could have been much better.My suggestion:
If you're a follower of the series, go see it to see how it all ends. Just wait until a weekday showtime when your theater offers a reduced price on your tickets (or just wait until it comes on video...trust me, it won't be that long).",Halloween

The transport bus crashing is so played out, they could've came up with something else. Second, the cops don't want to cancel Halloween even though the most evil serial killer is leaving gruesomely dead bodies everywhere. Third, the psychiatrist killing the cop was a definite twist but didn't go anywhere and made no sense, didn't contribute anything. Fourth, burning the house down and not seeing him after. Let me guess, is he coming next Halloween but with his body all burnt up now? Why didn't they explain it more on a psychological sense? The relationship between Michael and Laurie. Why didn't they add maybe Michael speaking for once or just something new? Something exciting.

1411,metalgearsolidx17,Laurie & Michael: 40 Years Later,8,19 October 2018,"After Rob Zombie' s Halloween films, the Halloween series went into limbo, not knowing when and if our favorite William Shattener masked psycho would return. To think that 40 years after that famous Halloween night of 1978 that Michael Meyer's would return but, more surprisingly with Jamie Lee Curtis returning to play Laurie Strode (for a 4th time I think). Also, it is considered ""definitive"" and cannonical sequel to the original (for how long we will see) that this film was envisioned and directed by the man who made Pineapple express (David Gordon Green) and co written by him and Danny McBride (who also co produced with Gordon Green) as well as John Carpenter giving his blessing (also co composed the score with his son Cody). Plus, the the trailers were so well paced and shot that I couldn't help but be excited and what I got was exactly what I thought it would be, a well made, nostalgic slasher film.Pros:Unhinged Jamie Lee: I love Jamie Lee Curtis from her good (True Lies, 1978 Halloween) to her bad (Christmas with the Kranks) but, this may be her best performance she has ever given. Curtis sells this deeply disturbed version of Laurie who 40 years prior saw all her friends die and narrowly escaped the clutches of a ni unstoppable force of pure evil and instead of lying down, she has made it her life mission to put Meyers in the ground (sounds a lot like another women with the last name Connor). Simply put, Curtis effectively portrays a broken women who has only one reason to live, to see Michael Meyers dead by her hands. Sacrificing everything including her family relationship with her daughter Karen (Judy Greer) and being overprotective of her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) to get the solace she wants and deserves.Psychosocial Meyer's: This isn't your parents Michael Meyers who killed people for doing no no things (sex, drugs, and alcohol) or for just being a douche. This version is a more real as in Michael kills whoever Michael sees (and he doesn't age discriminate). The manner of which he kills his victims is not as convoluted (strangling, stabbing, crushing just to name a few). This makes for a more grounded Michael that is much more closer to a deranged psychopath who is only motivation in life is to kill.Score: It's John Carpentar and his son Cody doing it, so there is not much to say.Effects: All practical from what I can tell which is a big plus.Cinematography: Numerous creative shots (that amazing one take of Michael breaking in and killing people in the trailer just to name one) and seeing movement in the background helped build tension in certain scenes. Overall, well shot.Slasher Movie Tropes: Because we all love them (and hate them as I'll mention later).Parody? And Refrences: Numerous references to pretty much every film in the series (especially to the first film). Good comedy for the most part that gave a breather to the suspense.Cons:Slight Uneven Tone: While I thought the comedy did work for the most part, I thought there were a few times that it would either include or cutaway to a joke in a tense scene randomly, which would kill the atmosphere and tension.Slasher Movie Tropes: The usual, dumb characters make dumb decisions, which makes a slasher movie what it is.Overall, Halloween 2018 is probably the best made film since the original from a filmmaking aspect. With Jamie Lee coming back to kick some Michael Meyer's a**, why wouldn't you see it. If your a Jamie Lee, Halloween or a slasher fan, then this is a must see (though, do try to see it at night).Verdict:Go see it in the theater and have fun, just don't overdose on Candy or end up like Ben Tramer.",Halloween

Unfortunately the rest of the movie is a desperate, boiling mess of a film. It contains every single cliché and trope of all previous Halloween movies. This would be fine, if they were at least done well. But they are not.The ""important"" scenes with Myers like discovering the mask are just clumsy and not effective at all. For a similar scene that actually works and has the impact it needs check out Jason discovering the hockey mask in the Friday The 13th remake (2009).The script runs from completely uninspired to cingryworthyly dreadful. The cinemetography has no flair, no atmosphere and David Gordon Green's directrion feels like he watched the original Halloween film, got really over excited and then tried to copy it, and not in a lovingly homage way either. Scenes are flat out lifted from JC's film and shoved into this movie, losing all of their creepyness and impact and making little to no sense at all.Honestly, I dread to think how bad the two sequels are going to be. It concerns me a great deal that this movie appears to have a lot of positive reviews, when its just plain bad.Even Will Patton can't save it.

Disrupting a years-long hiatus of Hollywood's premier slasher genre, this film is a return to form with vintage feel interwoven with a modern spin. Truly a film to end the drought of worthy slasher flicks, 'Halloween' (2018) will certainly satisfy if not exceed your expectations.",Halloween

1426,kurtboyd,A little disappointed-H2O on steroids,4,21 October 2018,"I wanted to like this, I really did, and based on the trailer, I thought I would, but it oversold itself.As a fan of the other movies, I was willing to suspend disbelief over yet another ""retcon"" and go with another continuity switch. The trailer pretty much gives away all the ""jump scares"", and while I didn't have a problem with the violence (though it was a little more on Rob Zombie level compared to the previous non-Zombie ""Halloween"" movies), I was a little disturbed when Michael snaps a little kid's neck. I mean, come on.Also, everybody reacts to trauma in different ways and on their own timetable, but it seemed a stretch for Laurie to spend forty years booby-trapping her survivalist fortress of a home over the circumstances of the original film alone. Maybe if H2 and H2O were included in this storyline it would be more believable, but in this viewer's mind it was a little much.Overall not a bad movie if you're looking for an old-fashioned slasher flick during the Halloween season, but as a fan of all the others, I felt a little slighted. Now with the great box office this is doing, we will undoubtedly face another sequel and have to pick which alternate continuity in the series we Halloween fans want to follow.",Halloween

If you just want to see Micheal Myers kill a bunch of people and are also fans of the original, you probably won't be disappointed.

But it is true, it feels like too much different movies into one and the real Halloween idea it's not on across the film and it's very disappointing. Besides that I liked... as a Halloween fan. If you didn't liked it might be because you didn't watched the 1978 film and you're not a full fan. Cheers",Halloween

I read a couple and I think some bad reviewrs just lack some logic.Ignoring all the lame halloween sequels. Being this one a direct sequel to de original is,
#1: best horror sequel EVER!
#2: best recent horror franchise revival.
#3: best slasher/horroe movie horroe year.Being a slasher movie these days... oh dude it's hard to please the entire audience. Of course there will be clichés. The jokes. The jumps. The silly decision making. But guess what? People really make stupid decisions in real life too. Not just in slasher flicks.Overall, for me, for a horror freak and huge fan of this franchise since I was five, I really enjoyed it. I actually loved it. The kills, the tension. The atmosphere. The match. Even though I didn't like the ending that much, I still feel it's the best Halloween sequel EVER.And if you ever compare a film to others, make sure you do it under the same genre. And in horror movies you gotta know there are several subgenres. 😊Go see Michael Myers on the big screen. It is definatelly worth it.",Halloween

So the ret-cons they made didn't bother me. I had only seen the first Halloween movie before seeing this, so I was pumped that this was a direct sequel.This is, to me, the new standard for slasher films. This is exactly the way to make an old-school slasher for the modern era. Michael Myers is still as ruthless as he was 40 years ago. The updated score bridges the gap between that time and now perfectly. (But don't worry, the classic is still there too) And the masterful cinematography shows how Michael can be anywhere, at anytime. Even if he's just barely in the frame, with no focus put on him at all.This movie is exactly what it needed to be; a phenomenal follow up to one of the best horror movies of all time. I strongly recommend it.",Halloween

Laurie struggling with PTSD and being agoraphobic was pure genius. It was very interesting to see that dynamic. The podcasters who came to interview Michael and Laurie were Incidental to me. All the events that transpired could've still happened without them.The one big complaint I had was the choice they made to have Michael's Dr to kill Hawkins so they wouldn't hurt Michael. I just thought the whole angle was dumb.The last 45 minutes of the movie were by far the best. Judt Greer was phenomenal in the final act pretending to be weak and not able to take on Michael. I will definitely be picking this up on 4K when it's released.,Halloween

1457,jacklittler-19012,If you watch this as a comedy - its halerious,6,29 January 2021,"Hard spoilers - just beware.So this movie is fantastic if you find inconsistencies and utterly stupid characters funny.
First off. A dad and his son go hunting and come across a crashed prison bus, with multiple convicts in full prison attire walking around. What does the dad do? Gets out and goes for a walk and leaves his kid in the parked car with all the convicts walking around. The doctor in the bus with them, who's completely okay with strangers coming into his facility to wave murderous objects in front of his patients btw, is left unharmed by all the convicts. Obviously they have killed all the guards, but not the doctor. The kid then shoots the doctor at point blank range with a large hunting rifle through the chest / shoulder area.
Then the 2 almost main characters so far are instantly killed off and we're given new characters to root for.
The doctor appears again after only a few hours of being shot with a sling and no other issues, seems the bullet barely affected the small old man at all.
Then Jamie finds out he's escaped. Tries to tell her daughter- doesn't manage to, then gives in trying, and decides a long car ride would be better than a phone call. Doesn't even bother trying to tell her grand daughter for a couple of hours.
The police know he's escaped, but rather than go to the town where he's heading they just wait at the police station until he's already killed half a dozen people.
Then Jamie manages to shoot him through the chest, but rather than chasing after a man she could safely assume she has seriously wounded if not killed, she just let's him walk away and has a chat with the police. Bare in mind, she still hasn't told any of her family a psychopathic murder is in town killing people.
Then the doctor, with one arm, after being shot only very recently, manages to carry and unconcious Michael- a very large man, and put him into the back of a police car with the grand daughter. Michael's favourite thing to kill - teenage girls, I mean, he'll kill anything he can, the moment he can, but he definitely loves killing teens. So anyway he's in the back of this police car with this teen, the grand daughter of his most hated target, and when he wakes up, he simply puts his mask back on, and kicks through the reinforced police grating. Then with the teenage girl screaming next to him, he simply gets out and leaves her...
He heads towards Jamie's house, must have sat nav and her address I assume, the girl decides it would also be a good idea to go to the same place as Michael. Shes running for her life through the woods even though Michael isn't even chasing her... then when she gets to the house, and just in case Michael changes his mind about killing, she kindly let's him know where she is by screaming.
None of the family go looking for the teen and leave her on her own, the dad, whilst a psycho killer is on the loose, decides to open the gate and go check on the police in the dark, then hangs out for a bit without looking around him after seeing the police are dead. I'd also like to point out that at no point does he go out looking for his only child, despite her not answering her phone and being no where to be found. Actually none of her family go out to look for her... at all. Savage.
Jamie and the mum are in the panic room now. Shes also put cameras all around her house. Are the screens to the cameras inside the panic room you ask? Nope, every panic room on the entire planet puts its screens in there, but not our Jamie! They're in the living room. The panic room is in the basement and is very well hidden, must of cost a fortune for that door. So when Michael is in the house the first thing they do is shoot through the floor at him, kindly letting him know where they are. Yes. Shes spent thousands on fortifying her house and decades doing naught but preparing, and decides the best thing for a panic room ceiling.... is a thin plank of wood.
Jamie decides to use a long shotgun for close combat in a very narrow space. And goes after him, the mum, who has also been well trained and has access to several firearms, decides it best to leave her elderly grandma to face Michael alone. Surprisingly enough she doesn't have enough time to point the long gun at Michael before he grabs her. However, as an old lady, when pinned against the wall, she does manage to push the giant unkillable man off her. The same guy that just kicked through a reinforced police car cage. Adrenaline I guess.
She's set up locked doors around the house, but no cameras, no traps, just. Doors.
The teen finally enters the house and calls for help. Her mother? Oh she's just chilling in the panic room. Does she arm herself and run to her daughter to warn her of the killer in the house that could murder her at any second? Nope. She waits a little then opens the trap door.
With all the guns to choose from - the women wisely choose a single knife to defend themselves.
They manage to trap Michael in the panic room. Then rather than using a shotgun to blow him to tiny pieces, they decide to destroy her entire home by setting it on fire. Do they shoot him first? Do they make sure he's dead? Do they watch him die? And come on, Jamie really wants to kill this guy, really wants to watch him suffer, but decides she'd rather burn her house down and leave it to fate.Needless to say - I was howling with laughter the entire movie and was routing for Michael to kill all these pathetically stupid characters. Im a little surprised there wasn't more backlash for portraying women as such weak and dumb people, I know I'd be a little offended if I was female. Nothing about this movie made it feel like a horror apart from the blood.
But like I said - if you're looking for a comedy horror like scary movie, this is a great film.",Halloween

They built a plot in the beginning, but then everything went downhill. By halftime, we're just watching who Michael Myers will kill next. The ending was terrible, and every character was unlikeable.In case you didn't read all of that, trust me: Don't watch this movie.",Halloween

But I just had to see this. Reboots of classical horror films usually end up being quite bad, but this is an exception. I'm not a follower of the halloween series, so I don't know a whole lot about it. But for me, it was an almost perfect horror/slasher movie. Of course, there are some problems, for example dumb cops and people and there is a plot hole here and there. Sometimes the movie could be quite predictable as well. But other than that, everything was good. I heard someone in the cinema say:
For the first time in a long time, I could relate to the characters in a horror movie!And honestly, that was exactly what I felt. There was actual character build-up in the movie, and I cared for them. Myers was brutal, which he should've been. He is a psychopath, a mentally ill serial killer. Of course he would kill them like that.Both sound and picture was excellent, with the soundtrack being extremely good. It fitted perfectly in most of the scenes. The acting was also very good, and Jamie Lee Curtis did an amazing job.",Halloween

1461,joecarmody-02089,Not worth the Hype!!!,7,22 October 2018,Was excited to see this film. Billed as the definitive sequel to the classic 1978 masterpiece of the same name. Unfortunately the rave reviews that I had read in the run up to watching this seemed to have been for a film we deserved but didn't receive.It's a quite boring standard run of the mill slasher to be perfectly honest. There is no real innovation in the story and the acting is quite wooden surprisingly. Barring the iconic music I didn't really feel any nostalgia for the previous instalments and I actually got quite heavy eyed as the plot plodded on in a way that leaves you not really caring what happens after the hour mark.I don't know how with so much material they made such a boring film but that's what sadly has been produced here.,Halloween
1462,rogerdornyep,Not Halloween,1,18 January 2019,I'm sorry but this movie sucks. Very boring. The best cast member is Jaime Lee but unfortunately she is only in the movie for ten minutes. My biggest problem was Michael always had an affinity for children however spoiler he kills a twelve year old. Within 18 minutes. Anyone after the kid in they original after he was bullied and lost his pumpkin would agree that Michael although crazy would not hurt a kid.

The death scenes are distrubing and bloody and the suspense was all there, especially the showdown between Laurie and Michael. It's also great seeing Jamie Lee Curtis back as Laurie Strode and seeing how Laurie has changed and still dealing with the trauma that happened 40 years ago. Newcomer Andi Matichak as Allyson Strode is terrific and earning herself as a final girl.

Michael Myers returns as a brutal killing machine, some parts made it feel like it was the original Michael back and others didn't. The movie would be ok to watch as a stand alone movie as the recap on the original is detailed perfectly. The soundtrack to the movie is absolutely amazing and definitely my favourite soundtrack in any movie by far. Not too many jumpscares which is also ideal as I feel movies lately seem to just rely on the jumpscares to be scary. This movie is more intense and the scary parts of the movie are knowing Michael is a killing machine and can strike at any time. Jamie Lee Curtis also pulls off her character perfectly playing a crazy old lady who knows what's coming and is more than well prepared for it.The ending of the movie I think they did perfectly. Kind of guessed how it was going to end before I went to see the movie but I still think they did it perfectly so that it leaves the door open for a sequel which there has been a lot of discussion about recently.",Halloween
1480,tbwhitman,"5.9, but really not that good whatsoever.",6,26 October 2018,"I would rate Halloween a total of 5.9 out of 10. Many reasons explain why it was as bad as I think it was opinion wise. I do think there were some actual good and even great parts in it and I'll go over those first. The two great parts I noticed was Michaels creative way of killing people definitely advanced in the best way possible making it extremely cool to see during and the after result. A lot of jaw breaking kills and the creativity with the flashlight and tearing the teeth out to scare his next victim was great. Another great part was when Lori was searching for Michael towards the end, it honestly had me on the edge, anxiously waiting for Michael to come out and it wasn't predictable at all when he'd jump out. A pretty good part was the few comedy it had but that's not bad at all that it was few cause too much comedy in a horror thriller movie doesn't make it a horror thriller movie anymore. Also Lori being aware and prepared kinda made the movie seem like it was going to be very good, but onto the cons. To start, it completely disregarded the last 6 movies (minus the third movie), which I understand, to make it more realistic cause Michael should have died a long time ago. So they skipped over him falling off the roof and somehow he got captured. He literally got shot 6 times and fell two stories (so much for trying to keep it realistic, an average human with even extra strength would suffer getting back up if alive), and just walked away but was captured right after and held for 40 years. It took Michael 40 years to leave that facility? He could've whenever but I mean it's not a big deal. Not only did they skip one major key but they also skipped how he even escaped? Obviously it was on the bus ride but that could have been an awesome scene to watch. Like one of the best scenes to watch, personally I enjoy escape scenes on a vehicle. Also what even happen to those other maniacs that escaped? They all easily could have done as much damage as Michael if not more, but I guess that doesn't matter? So the movie completely skips over important information, it was almost as annoying as thanos just showing up with the power stone randomly at the beginning without showing an awesome scene of him destroying everyone to get it. Although it is a scary movie and almost all the Halloween's are pretty predictable. It was almost more predictable than the other Halloween's, they had 40 years to fix that and they made it more predictable than the others, Lori falling off the roof like Michael in the first one, then disappears as he did. Michael showing up behind people way too many times and the lights scene with the teenage guy Was just way to predictable. Almost all of it was a big prediction from the beginning with the fire trap and loris granddaughter ending up holding the knife. I probably could have fallen asleep and guessed what would have happen. Also there was just 0 Halloween feel to it. Like the comedy and actors didn't make it feel like a Halloween spooky movie. The first 5 Halloween's just felt right. Like they were just made to be, this one really didn't give off that vibe. Also Lori was preparing for Michael to come and completely almost died before Michael even came into the house. But it was cool how she blew off his hand to be honest. Halfway through the movie the fake ""Dr loomis"" is with a cop and runs Michael over, michael is said to be dead, fake dr loomis stabs the cop and puts michaels mask on and at that point I almost gave up on the movie cause I seriously thought he was about to take over michaels role and the whole plot would have just been destroyed. But he drags that large man, even tho this is the smallest character in the show with an injury, up into a cop car and seriously thinks Michael will team up with him. Ends up getting killed by michael from his boot which was really cool with the effects and gore but honestly not sure if a half applied pressure would smash his head like a smack with a very large hammer would. Another random observation that doesn't make a lot of sense is if this is Halloween 2 technically then why is it just called Halloween?? So it goes Halloween and Halloween ? It's just kind of confusing if you and you're friends are trying to watch and you say, oh let's watch Halloween, that's when you'd say, the good or the trashy one?? Also the realistic parts kind of end when he gets hit with a car and shot in the head and stabbed multiple times. You'd think, okay well I guess they're going the path where he's evil and can't die. Bu a wimpy fire kills this man. I'm sure he could've escaped but they avoided the Halloween ending where he lives. So loris granddaughter is going to kill now? Honestly who even knows... Halloween basically felt like a 30 minute movie with the actual good and relevant parts in it. It almost felt like walking dead season 7-9 where they just fill up parts of it with random stuff that no one needs to know about such as a podcast crew having nothing to do with anything, a black kid seeing michael and disappearing, loris daughter training to fight, loris granddaughters love life and honestly the list could go on and on about non relevant items which could have just been used to show stuff such as the bus escape and how Michael gets captured in the first place or what happens to him at the end. Generally in thriller horror films there are actually pretty decent jump scares but in this movie there were literally 0-1/2 of one. They were so awful that sometimes it would just cut into another scene while it was happening. There's so many things wrong with this and coming in with really high expectations I was disappointed.",Halloween

1483,PennywiseTheRatingClown,Stunning Sequel With Disclaimer,8,12 November 2018,"This is the first Halloween I've seen after the original, and it didn't disappoint!Much like the original this sequel manages to create a very dark and threatening atmosphere. While still capturing enough of the original scary vibe, this film focusses a lot more on the psychological aspects of the characters and similarities between Laurie and The Shape. It's a risky choice of the director, but in my opinion it paid off.I also love the way they went with Laurie. Instead of going for the more cliché treatment female characters often get they chose to make Laurie a strong and pragmatic woman but with lots of personal troubles. It feels very realistic and makes total sense in the story. Jamie Lee Curtis once again does a fabulous job at portraying the iconic character.The thing I believe is dividing the viewers so much is the treatment of Michael Myers and his antics. In the original he is almost like a shadow, choosing his victims and stalking them a long time before finally killing them.
In this film Michael is much more visible, and he doesn't really stalk people. Some killings are fairly random while in the original every kill served a purpose. I understand why people see this as bad writing, since it's kinda untrue to Michael's character. My guess is Michael just doesn't care anymore after being locked up for so long and just wants to murder again and finish his business with Laurie. Also, later on in the film it's shown Michael is still capable of using his old ways. The chilling scene when he's hiding somewhere in Laurie's house is the best example.Overall, the paranoid suspenseful moments that made the original so great are still present in this film, but fragmented and shorter. If you expect a total frightening paranoia play from start till finish like the first one you're gonna get disappointed.Finally two great points that need to be addressed: all the great little easter eggs and nods to the original, and the stunning score by John Carpenter himself!9/10",Halloween

1485,AmadoAmado,A comedy in every scene,6,18 November 2018,"Halloween 2018, a ""senseless fun"" movie that focused hundred percent on women's power, setting aside the men who ended up doing nothing in the movie but dying in grotesque ways, thus having no impact on the story of the film, jumpscare in some situations were well introduced but in the course of the story is repetitive and reaches a point are ""forced"",
Positive point is the nostalgia of the movie soundtrack that makes you shiver
From a horror / suspense movie to an action movie, terrible choice.
Because of the nostalgia feeling you get 6/10.
Concluding, Halloween 2018 is rather a movie to watch and repeat, containing scenes that can hurt the male pride of many at the same time pleasing the feminine pride of many.",Halloween

So, let's say I give the original 10+/10, easily. My expectations and hopes for this one (going by the trailers and everything I heard about it) was 9.9/10. And it wasn't. 9/10, yes. Was it fantastic? Absolutely. I just wanted it to give me the same feeling I had (and still have) when watching the original. And it simply didn't, unfortunately.But then I realized, nothing is ever going to and my expectations for it were unreasonable. On it's own, I did love it. I plan on going to see it again, so maybe I'll change my mind upon watching it a second time.Still a must-see, but don't expect it to be as good as the original.",Halloween
1489,dalejennings-07005,Such a disappointment,1,21 October 2018,"I was so looking forward to this movie having been a big fan of the original and getting hyped by the awesome trailer, but what a big let down.
The movie lacks the suspense and mystery of the original, it is very confused in its tone and delivery for example there is a lot of comedy in this movie which instantly takes away any suspense they were trying to build.
The acting and dialogue is so bad it made me cringe watching it, with such lines as ""get back in your house I'm a doctor"" and ""I spilled peanut butter on my penis"" . Also the police in the movie are completely incompetent, from the black cowboy commander, to the two idiots in the police car having a 5 minute conversation about a sandwich, while a deranged murderous serial killer is on the loose????
And why is every young male character in this movie extremely camp?? The scene where the father and son driving down the road and come across the crashed bus and his son is saying that he ""doesn't want to go hunting"" he ""just wants to dance"" in some weird Billy Elliot mini story???
This movie totally missed the mark. With Michael Myers less is more, you see him way too often. He should be stalking his pray in the background building suspense and tension ready to jump out, this version sees the camara following him around in the 3rd person taking away the mystery.
This movie had a good premise but was poorly executed.",Halloween

1491,vanderklokt,Liked alot but 1 major flaw,8,24 October 2018,"As a Halloween franchise fan I've been very much anticipating this movie. Finally a sequel to the amazing Carpenter Halloween Original. Halloween 2 was in my opinion also a great film, but after that......the franchise went of the rails and by Halloween 6, it was just an atrocious franchise. So now we get Carpenter Back, a great directing crew, and Jamie Lee and Nick Castle back to play the two iconic Roles. I thought it was VERY clever to make the movie just as much about Laurie killing Micheal as much as Micheal killing everyone else. I thought the movie was very well done. The only problem I had with it was, they very much ""Humanized"" the shape (Micheal Myers), Where we were always lead to believe he was immortal evil just in human form. Other than that 1 (but major) aspect, I really liked the film. Alot of people are mentioning flaws like ""no hospital would allow reporters to interview a mental patient"" or ""police would not give a couple reporters the mask"" and although they are correct, name a horror movie that isnt a bit far from reality!! Great film....Jamie Lee Curtis was BRILLIANT!!",Halloween

1495,OliviaJackson_JO,Myers and Strode Reunite to Deliver A Quality Horror Sequel!,8,2 November 2018,"I watched the original Halloween (1978) the night before Halloween, then bought tickets to this release on Halloween afternoon. I stepped out of the cinema after watching an early viewing of this movie, masked children trickling out into the streets as dusk approached. I didn't plan for it, but after watching the newest installment of Halloween, I couldn't have asked for a better post-horror film atmosphere.Halloween (2018) was not only true to the 1978 original, it was a great sequel - in any genre. It was the same premise but this sequel evolved to match the style of movies today - in a good way. If this movie and the original were the only two in the franchise I wouldn't be disappointed; as a sequel, you couldn't ask for more. There were similarities to the original - it's hard not to compare - but they weren't overdone and nothing felt copied or 'already done', like in the latest Star Wars movies.
The film starts out well, the acting was good, and they were successful at creating empathy for the core characters. In the original, the kill scenes were scary and ominous, but it was difficult to feel any great loss for any character other than maybe Loomis or Strode. This film even had you rooting for Strode's son-in-law to survive - you felt it would be horrible for several of the characters to get caught by Michael, which is great. Many of the characters in this film were well played and very likeable. Even the minor characters' dialog was good (in the original, the dialog was painful and flat).The pace of the movie was good and held your attention throughout. Michael is back for revenge in a big way, but this time he's also the one being hunted, but in no way was Myers weak. This version of Myers was scarier, more terrifying, more efficient, calculated and brutal in his kills. You never get a sense that any character could ever get close to stabbing Myers with a crochet needle - it seemed to be an impossibility. If you were within a ten-foot radius of Michael, you were dead. Period. I thought this was the scariest Michael, by far. The moment he put his mask on, the mask looked like it was smiling as Michael put it over his head as if having a life of its own, happy to be with its owner again. The scares and kills in this film were well written and executed - the motion light scene was really well done. I was so happy to watch a horror movie that didn't rely on jump scares, and the ones that were in the movie were mostly silly on purpose. The famous Halloween tune wasn't overdone and the overall sounds and music in the movie were really good.I thought there were some things in the movie that were predictable, but that could be because I have a bad habit of analyzing movies as I watch them. I could nitpick at things about the movie that didn't make sense, think it's just that never-ending writer vs viewer thing I never like getting caught up in. In one scene you could ask why the floodlights weren't turned on earlier, but there could be a hundred reasons. But I will say that having a safe house littered with creepy mannequins - even if they did have a small use in the film - seems really bad for the mental well-being of anyone in the movie. One character's scream (the granddaughter) was horrible - and she did it twice, the second time seemingly for not really any good reason. Shock and silence would have been more effective in my opinion.The thing I really liked about this movie is that more than one character had an arc. There were struggles, there was change through obstacles, and some things that seemed impossible in the beginning fought their way toward trying to make changes. The women in the movie kicked some butt, but at no time in the film was I thinking any of the women were Mary Sues. The movie was very much about accepting your fate and having important people's lives rely on the decision of accepting it or not. Halloween showed great realism with the acting, sounds, and actions of the characters. The movie didn't pull any punches, unlike ""The Meg"" which had the potential to be terrifying, but played like a pro boxer with 80-ounce gloves on. The writers and director made you care for the characters deeply and then murdered them mercilessly right in front of you.A surprisingly pure joy to watch!Horror/Thriller Movie Reviews

Perhaps you're 12 years old and your favorite horror movie contains Jennifer Love Hewitt as the star. Or Nemo. Or that guy who played Shaggy... those of us that are mature horror movie watchers; those of us that sat at 6 years old with a bat every Saturday watching horror movies for hours with Dr. Paul Bearer (not the 'wrassler') did any of you people know anything about that what is great? THANK YOU to every critic that said this was not a good movie. Now I know that I can watch your critiques and know what to watch cuz if you don't like it it's probably a good flick if you do like it it's probably got the kid who played Shaggy as your favorite horror movie. Because if you paid attention... maybe you should have watched more than the ones that had Busta Rhymes in it...maybe you should do a little research on John Carpenter and the 21 days he had to make the original and have this sequel -which is the only NESECCARY sequel- whitch negates all the other sequels, you idiots! Maybe YOU should go back and watch it. My God! I'm so happy to know who you are because every movie that you review when you said it's scary I know it's not cuz it doesn't have Shaggy or Jennifer Love Hewitt in it but if you say it's not scary or not good enough then I know I need to put some investment into that because clearly you have no idea what you're talking about. Do you know what it's like to be scared in the dark?!I don't think you do. I don't think you even watched the movie.

Plot
I find this as one of the best stories from the Halloween franchise as it pays a massive amount of tribute to the first, and i feel audiences can see patterns. There's something that happens near the end that I didn't really like and I guess most people didn't also.
Characters
There are way too many characters in this film and I think that was more for the audience, younger demographic, but if they are planning to have a sequel I pray they cut down the number of characters, but the main characters are great.
Michael Myers
It's been a long time since an iconic horror character has been portrayed as terrifying, I feel like the director really did get Myers right as when he was on screen it was chilling every time.
Scares
Like the first, it's more psychological horror (as i saw it) than the norm, but it also elements of modern horror but does it right.
Comedy?
Some of it works and some of it doesn't

1507,anon-12295,Ruined The Legacy,1,27 January 2019,"I've always been a huge fan of the Halloween movies and their legacy. I've watched all of the movies, the original and their sequels, everything, and I'm in the same age group that the makers of this movie were obviously targeting. I think they altered the legacy of this movie because they didn't think anybody would notice since they assumed only younger viewers who never watched the originals would be seeing this. But they were obviously wrong.The way that this movie was filmed did make this movie scary whatsoever. In all of the previous movies (not including Rob Zombies) they always made me jump. This movie has absolutely no suspense, no scares. Nothing. They made almost every character in this film so unlikable that I don't think I was ever rooting for any of them to survive. On top of that, they chose to completely erase the fact that Michael and Laurie were related. Which honestly doesn't make much sense because this movie shows Michael hunting down Laurie to kill her. That was the point in the original film as well. He broke out, stalked Laurie, she saw him everywhere, he was hunting her down. So, why her? Why her specifically? If this a direct sequel to the original movie, where the whole point was Michael hunting her down and killing everyone in his way to get to her, than what is the point? I guess some could argue that he wants to finish what he started but this is supposed to be 40 years later to the original film, and in the original film he is hunting her down specifically, so this movie doesn't explain why. Erasing that one big plot point was a huge mistake. It is made Michael Myers even more evil, that he would want to kill his own last surviving sister who he didn't even know. Also, I did some research into this movie after seeing it and found an interview Jamie Lee and the director did where they decided to throw some politics into the mix. Apparently, in this movie, they state that unlike H20, this shows Laurie ""taking her life back"", which also, makes zero sense. How is Laurie taking her life back when she spent the last 40 years obsessing over Michael and losing her family in the process, taking her life back? They said that in H20, that movie was more about Laurie losing her way and ""alcoholism"", when this movie is exactly that as well. At least in H20, she somewhat built a life for herself and attempted to move on. In this one, her entire life revolves around Michael. She lives in a house that she built specifically to prepare his return. And, has issues with alcohol apparently as you can see in the dinner scene and the car scene outside the hospital when Michael gets transferred. If any movie is Laurie ""taking her life back"", it's H20, not this one, which says a lot because H20 wasn't very well received in the first place. I also don't understand why every movie has to contain some sort of political message. Movies are what we come to so that we can escape for a little while, not be reminded of the sad reality we live in. This movie has so many problems wrong with it, it's not scary whatsoever, not even a little bit, and too many mistakes were made in this one. I hope there is no sequel, and if there is, I hope it either comes from different people or they learn from the mistakes. Which I highly doubt. It seems to me like every movie that was made after the originals, including Rob Zombies and this one, just didn't understand what made the originals so great. This movie makes me feel like it was a very obvious cash grab exploiting the Halloween legacy, which they succeeded with since it made a decent amount of money. I guess it's safe to assume that we won't ever really get another Halloween movie that has the same feel to it which is what made Halloween special, ever again, which is sad.All in all, this movie could've been really great, I love Halloween and always want to see a new movie of that story, especially when Jaime Lee is in it, but this isn't it. I don't recommend this to anyone, either people who are fans of the Halloween story, or horror fans, because this movie is neither.",Halloween

I really just wish that there would have been more time spent with the lead actress, and more time developing her character, almost as if she were stepping into the shoes of the original ""Laurie"". There just was not much depth to her, with her storyline - she was a fine actress though.

It's been 40 years, a lot has changed and therefore the characters have changed. The 3 main actresses made a strong impression in a genre where the lead Male (the killer) is usually who we root for.

1514,caanany,What not to do when there is a serial killer,2,5 March 2019,"Every single scene was a total cringe. It seems like they purposely didn't do things that a normal person would to make the movie go on. First was when the Grandma did not explain why her daughters family needed to be worried, she just said ""The bus crashed,"" and didn't explain what she meant before leaving the house. It wasn't until people were dying that the daughter and family finally figured out Myers had escaped.
There were also many opportunities where he could've been finished off, but they dragged it out by having the Grandma do stupid things. For example, she see's him in the middle of the yard through the window, yet backs away as if she doesn't have a gun against a melee fighter. I also don't know why the daughter didn't put another bullet in his head to finish him off when he fell down the stairs, i'm guessing it was to make a dramatic exit with the whole house going down in flames.
The acting was also OK, the only reason why I am giving it 2 instead of 1 stars is because the scene with the cops talking about sandwiches was pretty funny, it was actually the only scene I enjoyed. Very predictable, not scary, almost laughable.",Halloween

I get it, the 1978 version is and always will be special but we gotta kill this character already. Mans done survived countless feats, my god he even went to space ! Any nostalgia the directors were trying to pull is being ruined with these remakes and sequels. The story is bad, it had an interesting premise and some promise the first 20 minutes but just turned to sh#t after. We gotta petition Hollywood to honor Johnny carp and his legacy and not allow them to continue to prostitute his characters for a Halloween box office pull, whoever is dumb enough to buy that ticket- I wasted a good hour of my life watching on cable.

1519,evjco,Wanted to like it,3,20 October 2019,"I tried my best! I tried to suspend my belief and get immersed in a slasher flick and I maybe could have if the one line by the millennial ""5 murders isn't that bad"" that made me think how much things have changed since the 70's. I didn't mind most of the characters even tho some story arcs made zero sense. But I can't let a few things go:1) there is NO WAY podcast reporters would get a hold of states evidence or be allowed to bring it into the hospital 2) IF they decided to transport the most dangerous psychopath in state history it wouldn't be on a bus with other patients and it wouldn't be so lax on security. 3) When he got loose and bodies started turning up there would be more than one police officer roaming around in search of him. There would be tactical teams, armored vehicles, helicopters, multiple K9 teams, state police and probably the FBI. 4) the doctor??? wtf? A totally unnecessary character and even more unnecessary attempt at a plot twist.
The likes? Laurie Strode was fantastic! Very believable with the PTSD and how it ruined relationships and changed her life. The deaths were a little gory but at least not the 2007 remake kind of over the top gory.
I really wanted to like this movie and watched it several times hoping I might see it differently or see something I missed before but I just can't give it a good rating. The scares are typical jump scares with no suspenseful build up or slow burn like the first one. I have my hopes up for the 2020 and 2021 movies tho!

Then the doctor looking after Michael Dr satan mmm that's one hint then the pen/knife he used to kill the sheriff look at the blade it's one of those demonic symbols .
So watching this it reminds me a little of the original Halloween movie and doesn't seem to follow the other movies in the franchise we get to h20 and was good for the era then we went Halloween resurrection and yeah ok wasnt bad but then it's all remade again through rob zombie and now back again to this one kind of think the eye has been taken off the ball here and need to rethink before it comes like Friday the 13th and gets dragged out .
For a serial killer to be shot and stabbed then shot in the eyes and set on fire (Halloween 2) then in part 4 shot to death 5th installment again killed off onto the 6th and so fourth this time fingers cut off and set on fire now end of the film we here breathing of Michael now what do you think did he or didn't he escape .
On top of this I really think before they jump in and make the next movie hey please think about it dont rush as the next movie could be made in such a way that it could be yet the best Halloween ever taking Michael back to the original stalker and hunter/killer",Halloween
1522,markytea,"This massive John Carpenter's Halloween fan wanted to love it, but was left cold. SPOILERS.",5,28 September 2019,"First, let me say, I am a massive, massive fan of John Carpenter's original classic, Halloween. I'll say in fact, the movie changed my life. It made me want to make movies, and it also made me want to prank scare people whenever possible. I made my own cheap version of the infamous William Shatner mask and would go out during Halloween trying to spook people. I tried getting into the mindset of The Shape. Whatever I'd imagined that may be. I would stand from a distance, let people see me, then when they looked away for a second, I'd run like hell as if to disappear. On one occasion, a girlfriend/boyfriend who I was friends with were making out in my local graveyard. It was misty, and the moon was shining through the haze. I walked up to within about 12 yards of them, stood there for about ten seconds and then slowly walked away. Disappearing in the mist. I then met up with my best friend who was watching from a distance and we waited a little further up the road, sniggering. The couple then came out of the cemetary. both shaking and they were convinced they'd seen a ghost. A man who seemed to float in the haze. Almost supernatural like.
Which brings me to what The Shape was to me. In my mind. A possible supernatural being - in the 'shape' of a man. John Carpenter confirmed this in interviews I read throughout the years that followed, as my obsession with the character only grew.
When I heard that this movie was being made, I was cautiously excited. Especially on hearing John Carpenter say 'These guys get it'.
October 19, 2018 arrived and I was there.
Immediately I was frustrated. A couple of irritating pod casters trying and failing to goad Michael into saying something. Then the opening credits rolled, and John Carpenter's score belted out. It was awesome. His music means as much to me as his movies. Hearing the Halloween theme being performed by him again was reason alone for this movie to justify its existence in my book. I dug the credit sequence too.
As the movie went on, there were things I felt were successful and other aspects frustratingly close to awful.
Jamie Lee Curtis stated in her promo interviews for the film, that this is a film about trauma. But the feeling I got, was that that they could have gotten much deeper into Lauries story. I feel like Jamie Lee Curtis, barring a few smallish scenes early on, was largely just in action mode. Curtis, was clearly on top form, so for me, its a shame we didn't get to have some real emotional scenes with her. The scenes where this was touched on felt too brief.
Michael's escape from the asylum. I read this scene was changed and that alternate events that were filmed may have changed this, but when Michael escapes and Laurie is watching him board the bus, almost breaking down, convinced he would escape... Why did she not follow the bus??! Surely she'd have tailed that thing every inch of its journey to its destination!?
Dr Sartain. An appallingly realized character. It would have been fine to have him in the asylum scenes, but when he reveals his obsession with Michael and seemingly aiding his escape from the bus, there is a scene where he feels the need top feel what its like to be Michael... So he puts on the mask. This was abysmal for two reasons... For me, nobody else should have put that mask on other than Michael in this film in my view, if only to help give the film the vibe of the original, and two, the guy looked ridiculous wearing the mask. You could hear many folks in the audience groan at that moment... Unintentional laughter was heard also. The films so so momentum was stopped dead in its tracks for me at that point. It just wasn't needed. This film should have been totally about The Shape returning to Haddonfield. No stupid, distracting twist required.
Which then leads me to did they even need to have Michael locked away anyway. At the end of Carpenter's original, The Shape disappears. I'd have left out the asylum/break out scene and just had him return from nowhere. Where he's been the last 40 years is something that doesn't need explaining. He is the Boogeyman, right?? Its the not knowing that helps make the character scary and effective. You could have had Laurie on edge... always expecting Michael's return... Had more time to go into her and her families back story and it would have made the whole safe-house element more believable. The fact they humanized Michael so much, makes it all the more ludicrous that Laurie would go to the extremes she did with that house. Would you really do that over a guy who killed a select few people forty years ago and has been incarcerated since??? If he were to have never been found after the events of '78, then I could buy it. Laurie has seen him shot six times etc... She KNOWS he's The Boogieman. David Gordon Green screwed it up here.'This isn't a man' - Dr Sam Loomis (Halloween 1978)Michael in this movie really was just a man. David Gordon Green went out of his way to prove that, and the result often felt closer to Rob Zombie's Halloween than Carpenter's. And the killings reflect that too. Sure, audiences wanna see violence, but this Michael had almost none of the prank playing, prowling, watching from the shadows or even hiding behind hedges in broad daylight that even the poorest sequels had. In the moment played often in the trailers, where Nick Castle cameos's seeing Laurie from the window, there was no tension at all. That should have been one of the greatest scenes in horror. But it was screwed up by showing too much of Michael and moments moments that interrupted any tension. As funny and scene stealing as the little kid was, his joking killed the tension of the scene. The audience was laughing while Michael was still being seen leaving the house in the moments that followed. Very poor horror film making I felt.
As was the moment before the 'Dr Sartain moment' where they just blatantly see Michael walking on the side of a road and try to run him down. Michael wouldn't have made himself that obvious. He'd have been looming in the shadows. Usually a step ahead.
The finale. This is where i felt the film stepped up a gear. There was one moment where Michael is fighting Laurie and gets distracted, when he looks back, Laurie is gone. Its such a brilliant nod to the original that it did give me chills. I also felt James Jude Courteney was a brilliant Michael, and I loved the mask. The lighting of those final scenes gave us some cracking visuals of Michael. Though why would Laurie be keeping mannequins inside that house is beyond me. She clearly still has a little stupidity about her. (Remember the knife dropping moments back in '78?).
But, much like his arrival to Haddonfield, his arrival at Laurie's house felt rushed. They could have eeked out the tension there surely. He got in the house way too quick for me.
I came out of the film feeling it felt oddly rushed. I believe had they just had The Shape return, out of the blue, without the asylum segment, it would have given potentially more time for tension through the rest of the film.
Its a shame. There is potential still with The Shape. The film had moments during the finale that proved that to me, but I just hope David Gordon Green has learnt from some sloppy mistakes here for next years - Halloween Kills.",Halloween

1526,abdulrahmaalbatili,Real Scary,6,5 November 2019,"Halloween is iconic horror series that made so many people from different generations attached to it every single Halloween because it added a special taste of the Halloween every year it drops. What made this series that iconic because it not only scares people, but also have a realistic sense of it. In other words, the monster which is the buggy man who could be any psychopath serial killer, that made it scary to the people and more realistic than any other horror movies, which the majority of the are about the surprise factor and scary colors not the story factor. Halloween 2018 added a fantastic end piece to this iconic series which made so many people from different generations attached to it. In addition, Halloween 2018 soundtracks and theme music played a big role to this movie legacy . The angels and the low key lights added a horror experience were the audience is expecting any character to be murdered at any moment. With the high advanced filmmaking techniques Halloween 2018 is a better horror experience than any other horror films. It could be more scarier if it has the surprise factor to the murder scenes.

It has a solid plot with a decent script with some comedic touches to the film which really make the film more realistic in a good way as it does not sway too far from the classic slasher genre but just adds some more funny or lighter moments to the overall darkness of the movie.
The movie also really well replicates many of the camera shots/scenes from the old original film with maybe slight twists (keeping it spoiler free).
The acting is pretty good, not the best I have seen but still adds a little more essence into the plot.
So overall it is definitely worth a watch if you are into the horror or slasher horror genre.",Halloween

A pure masterpiece and what made it great was the suspense, the music, and the stalking done by the shape. Halloween 2 was also excellent and every other halloween movie in the franchise after that in my opinion was garbage. Rob zombies versions were pure gore exploitation. So when i heard about this movie i was excited by everything i read as far as john carpenter being involved and starting off as a direct sequel to the original. So first im going to start off with the positives. I thought the storyline of the two reporters investigating the murders from 1978 was interesting. If you allow yourself to suspend realism and common sense it was good. The shape i thought was good and michael looked good in the new mask. Their were a couple of scenes i thought were done really well with the shape walking in and out of houses and killing people. Now for the bad. The new loomis character was over the top kooky and more of a cartoon character. Laurie strode was way over the top and i thought curtis did a lot of overacting. The rest of the cast was just there to be expendable. Overall it had potential but the writers and directors dropped the ball. The ending was also disappointing.

I went on mind and with further viewing it just sagged. Bland, uninteresting characters, messy micro plots, overdone gore/kill scenes and a villain that I was just bored of seeing creeping about anymore.The original was a very simple film with bags of tension due to Dean Cundey's ground breaking cinematography (steadicam shots), lighting and Carpenters score creating a really brooding watch without the need for excessive gore.IMO the first three movies are the only ones worth bothering with.

The film has the basic Slasher formula but with a few modern touches which works great. Its not as brutal as Rob Zombie's remake from a few years ago but still has some scenes of graphic violence. Michael Myers was well played in this too, he moved around just like the original Michael from 40 years ago. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job also, playing a terrorised yet strong survivor. I recommend this film to anyone who loves or enjoyed the original movie. I'm glad they wrote off all the other sequels because they were pretty weak. 8/10 :)",Halloween

Curtis' character was just a hysterical mess who really wasn't likeable. The DR of M. Myers had questionable character development. Michael Myers was not all that scary, frankly. Some of the vintage sounds and themes, from older Halloween movies, make the scenes almost funny rather than scary - because they just have not aged well.The thing they did right was pivot from previous Halloween films and make Michael Myers someone who will kill anyone for any reason rather than people connected to his family.Overall 4/10.

Michael gets hit by a car, shot twice, stabbed and has part of his hand chopped off and he's somehow still alive. And he doesn't make a peep. I was laughing at the end.
Jamie Lee Curtis was good, but the fact that her character prepared for 40 years and managed to still be unprepared for the moment was head scratching. ""Let's hide in this secret lair for 30 seconds and then shoot at him from below the floor and then I'll go up and check to see if he's there."" Yo, how about you stay in the lair, the only place where he cannot get you. STAY THERE. But nope. Let's search the entire house in the dark. The decision making was baffling. I get it, it's a slasher and that's how they all are, but it really took the scare factor out of the way because you couldn't root for a character. You got to the point where you just said ""they deserve to die at this point.""

Who is rating this film? This was probably the worst Halloween movie I've seen. At least the other bad ones were interesting.I was expecting to see the fictional yet iconic strong and indestructible like superman killer. He was still kind of strong, but very wimpy and looked wimpy. Did he cry when Jamie Lee Curtis bit his hand? She like shoves his face and it staggered him..lol.I'm used to slasher films being super fake. Like the killer has all day to kill someone, but likes to stare for 5 hours and moves in slow motion. Or people screaming helplessly for their lives when it's just one man 5 miles away and no one tries to defend themselves. I'm sure you're all familiar with the cliche's. I'm okay with all of it, but this movie took these things to the highest level of ridiculousness there can be.Nothing makes sense. The stories within the stories are pointless. Every other character other than the grandmother, mother and granddaughter were pointless and these 3 characters were borderline pointless. You won't care about anyone in this movie.

1576,oscarscottay1966,Not much to like about this film.,2,19 October 2018,"A couple of small spoilers.
My disappointment started at the beginning of the movie when I saw that John Carpenter did not write or direct this movie. Didn't realize at the time that this was a foreshadowing of how bad this movie was going to be. Still at the beginning despite this, I kept an open mind. The first thing that bothered me was that this movie lacked any real tension. Second, most of the death scenes were over the top bloody, violent, & gory. The original 1978 film had an abundance of tension & there was no blood or gore in the death scenes (which is what made it a classic). After getting home from watching this disappointment, my Daughter & I watched key scenes from the original & we discussed how incredibly well John Carpenter built tension in all of these key scenes. We also watched the death scenes & commented how well they were shot & that the lack of blood & gore did not take away any of the effectiveness of the scenes. The characters in this movie were ok. Laurie was, of course, played well by Jamie Lee Curtis. The one character that I absolutely loathed & really did not fit well at all in this movie was the ""new"" Doctor."" Terrible character not played well at all by the actor. I have the 10 disc Halloween Blu-ray box set. There is, obviously, some not very good movies in this box set (Rob Zombie's films are the worst of the bunch). That being said, I WILL NOT be buying this movie when it comes out on Blu-ray!",Halloween

1578,DRgam1,Wish I had waited for the Redbox release,4,21 October 2018,"I've seen every Halloween film, excluding the Rob Zombie versions, and each one had some redeeming qualities about them. The first two, imo, still reign supreme in the Myers' universe, as they defined the roles between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers. Both characters needed the other to exist and have meaning. But this latest entry made it abundantly clear to me how needless the other seven films--plus Mr. Zombie's two reboots--really were.I hate writing spoiler alerts and I won't ruin this film for anyone willing to pay to go to the theatres to see it, so I won't go into any real details. There were plenty of kills--on and off screen--but it just felt like the filmmakers were rushing a dying story along to it's inevitable end, but not doing a good job of taking its audience along for the ride.A few good jump scares, to me, does not equate to a very good horror movie.Laurie Strode has been reduced to a binge drinking, neurotic, gun-toting momma with zero people skills. Michael is still...well, Michael. Good old, non-responsive, non-speaking Michael. Both have aged but still can hold their own against the other. And if it had been just the two of them, mano a mano, to the very end--much like Neo and Agent Smith in Matrix Revolution--I would have rooted and cheered them on.But, instead I found myself squirming in my chair, wondering how did I allow myself to get suckered into yet another senseless slasher film with no strong plot, no strong characters, and no strong ending. Even the plot twist near the end of the film involving Myers' doctor was weak and did nothing to move the story along, seeming out of place and time, much like the rest of this movie.I went into this wanting to love this newest installment of the franchise. But I can't sit here now and lie--much like I lied to myself in that theatre chair--and say that this is going to get better. Believe me, it's not. I did like the few nods the filmmakers gave to some of the earlier films and John Carpenter's signature score.Trust me, this is not one of the Halloween movies that has to be viewed on the big screen to be fully enjoyed.

The writing is very lazy, they incorporate in every iconic moment from the first film in a attempt to please the fans but it comes off as pandering and uninspired. The kills are repetitive and not very original or gory except for 1. Whenever a little tension is building it is ruined with lame jokes which shouldnt be so surprising since Danny McBride is a co writer. It had major tone problems. You dont give a Damn about any of the teens unlike the original. At least the rob zombie movies tried to do something original. Maybe i just had my expectations to high.

The movie does fail in some regards like not supplying a breakthrough in terms of added depth to the story and not adding interesting characters apart from a reimagined Laurie Strode. Plus, it's clear the old slasher formula has lost its luster with audiences in a day and age where demons, spirits, and boundless gore rule the big screen. But, with that being said, this particular Halloween sets itself leaps and bounds above the myriad of sequels and reboots that have come out since the original. The scares are genuine, the action and atmosphere nerve-rackingly intense. Michael Myers is still just as terrifying now as he was 40 years ago, and Jamie Lee Curtis's Laurie Strode is an absolute force of nature. All of this, buoyed by John Carpenter's legendary and spine-chilling score, amounts to Halloween 2018 being a worthy sequel that deserves a special place in the genre, succeeding where so many others had fallen short.",Halloween

There are many references to the original throughout and it will be enjoyabble for any big fan to spot them all. It definitly feels as though this film is in the hands of people who respect the original and willing to pay homage throughout.Jamie Lee Curtis as always is fanstastic and reprises her role with aplomb.

Stuck in my mind is that these people are being killed by this old man who somehow grew mid-film and is all of a sudden 10 years younger but still an old fart.Also how many times does Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie Strode have to die? This time around she's not even related to Michael. The writers/director want us to accept that none of the other films post-Halloween (1978) ever happened. Not until Halloween II was it revealed that they were related. Well, now The Shape is back for his revenge, and Laurie has spent 40 years preparing for this moment. Again, really?!If it were not for all of the laughs I had in the expense of this terrible film this would tread into The Curse of Michael Myers territory. This is a film that should never have happened. Michael Myers/The Shape doesn't need any more films. If someone is going to make a film they should do something more original like Rob Zombie aspired to do. This is just more of the same from the first Halloween, but it's far too late.

Explore Laurie manic state after the attack 40 years. Why is she off the screen for 90 percent of the movie? Why?

1604,maverick9xx,"An extreme departure from the series, much to the disappointment of fans...",6,22 October 2018,"This film can essentially be characterized as ""Halloween"" with a feminist twist. The mystique and intrigue of the original series - and around Michael Myers himself - has been replaced with a tone of overwhelming darkness and dread, with Michael more a symbol of preternatural male rage than supernatural evil.In the classic series, one got the sense that Michael Myers lacked full autonomy, that he was under a dark spell and guided by one objective: killing off his bloodline. His target of Laurie Strode was precise and not random, and he did not deviate from his target. All killings were incidental to that aim.The new Halloween dispenses trades that intrigue for the mundane plot of a psycho killer on the loose, guided by nothing more than a mere human mind run amuck. There is nothing even remotely supernatural about this Michael Myers. He is simply a sick, deranged killer who relishes disposing of other human beings, valuing no one target over the other.The forces that ultimately conquer him are the three generations of women of the Strode family, extinguishing the figure that left such trauma on the eldest and imposed endless hardship on the other two. One cannot doubt the catharsis of this moment, but at what cost? Pursuing a route meant to cater to the mores of our time - three powerful women destroying a sick, evil man - completely upends the dynamic of the series, leaving us with the impression that Michael Myers was indeed just a ""man,"" and that the Boogeyman was a figment of our imagination.",Halloween

It's not like I DIDN'T enjoy the movie; I got my slasher thrills with the tense scenes, the classic 70s music and the creepy Myers shots. But there were so many plotholes and ridiculous moments (I found some of the humour well-placed but the Dad's peanut butter comment was really bizarre?) that just killed the vibe a little.I love Jamie Lee Curtis but Laurie Strode's house full of traps and gadgets seemed a little far-fetched and bordering on silly to me. For all of her preparation, the final showdown was not what we deserved and it's clear they wanted to leave it open for further films. But come on, he's RIGHT THERE in your basement and you're just gonna torch the place? Put a bullet through his brain?! Stab him again and again?! This was marketed as their 'FINAL SHOWDOWN'. why have her burn the house down when she had prepared for this so extensively? No end of guns and knives but it's a lighter she turns to?I had fun watching this movie for all its ridiculousness. There are a couple of fantastic scenes (when Michael looks out the window and Laurie has disappeared was extremely satisfying) and luckily every character I found annoying as hell got stabbed three ways from Sunday, but it was missing the true horror of the 'Halloween' history.",Halloween

1627,b_imdb-732-699681,Utterly stupid,3,15 August 2021,For somebody unfamiliar with the series it is just unbelievably stubid. I get the Genre and what and who the movie is made for. But if you're not one of the fans you really have to turn off every feeling of logic to be able to make it through this one. Didn't enjoy. In fact one of the worst ratings I've ever given. I even wrote this review...,Halloween
1628,lashayp17,Loved it!,7,21 October 2018,"As a die hard Halloween fan, I really enjoyed this film, and I believe that if you liked the John carpenter movies in the franchise, then you'd enjoy this one as well. I think it did a good job of regaining the suspenseful feel that the original had, it also shyed away from the overly gory killings and stuff that many horror movies these days, including the halloween sequels, seem to be drawn to. It focused more on building suspense and leaving a lot of brutal things to the viewers imagination. Personally this is a plus in horror for me. It even recreated a few scenes and paid homage the original and Halloween II, which I liked. Also, Jamie Lee Curtis is back, so huge plus straight out the gate. I really liked how a few of the situations in the movie, or reactions from some the characters were a bit different than the usual norm you would often expect In a film like this. To avoid spoilers, I won't delve into detail, but I think the writers did a good job with this, although yes, there are many clichés as well.You may have noticed that I didn't give the movie a 10/10, because of course, no film is perfect and it had its flaws. I will try not to say much to avoid any real spoilers for anyone wishing to see the film, but the things I say after this may be minor spoilers so if you want to go in will no reservations, you should probably stop reading at this point.
Ok enough warning. This one is obvious, from the campaigning of the film, but one of the drawbacks for me regarding this film and many others in the franchise, is the fact that the writers often cherry pick which movies they want to acknowledge and which ones they choose to ignore. For this movie, they completely ignored every sequel, and only acknowledged the original. They completely brushed off the major plot point of Halloween II and all the movies thereafter which state that Michael and Laurie are brother and sister. In this version of Halloween, 40 years later, Michael and Laurie aren't related at all, and that rumor was just something that people in the town made up. Luckily in this new film, the characters did choose to address this topic, although very breifly, and whether or not Michael and Lori are actually related doesn't really make a difference to the overall plot of the movie, so I wouldn't get too hung up on this issue.Another thing that irritated me about this movie was the addition of unnecessary characters. I won't say who specifically, but it seemed they just introduced some characters to only kill off, or worse, they only introduced characters to be douchebags to other characters and do NOTHING else. Needless to say, I could have don't without one character specifically. They served no real purpose to the plot and honestly had no real effect on the storyline.Finally, an issue, but not really an issue. The ending. I neither loved it nor hated it, but considering the endings to other movies in the franchise, I feel like they could have picked a better way to end, but I guess if you're just gonna ignore the other 9 movies, this ending can be pretty defacto.In closing I really did enjoy this movie, and I believe it stayed true to the original and would be an awesome place to end the franchise... or not end the franchise, I mean they found a way, regardless of how dumb the explanation is, to reverse the ending to H20. (I'm not gonna spoil it, also if you haven't watched it you should, it's one of the better sequels).It's a solid 7.5 out of 10 in my book. Not spooky scary, but a great thriller!",Halloween
1629,Dustin-bell88,It's about the EVOLUTION,10,10 February 2019,"Michael and Laurie are back. A new doctor watching after Michael. The expected miscues that lead to Michael returning home. The traumatized Laurie awaiting his return. And all of the innocent bystanders who were barely alive or not the first time Michael went AWOL. In my opinion this is definitely different than the original, but just as great of a horror movie. They allow Michaels pure evil to shine through. The original was shot in the 70s in a different America. People used to go to sleep with unlocked doors! So the original had all day to stalk and slowly build toward the events of that night resulting in 5 deaths. In today's world, people are much more untrusting and observant. Stalking is more likely to be noticed! So while this movie moves very quick after Michael is home, it holds its own as a worthy sequel. It shows off his darkness and the pure evil within him by his lack of caring for who is in the way of his path to Laurie. Comparing to the original will always lead to failed sequels, but realizing it's 2019 will help you see the movie a bit differently.",Halloween

(No real spoilers except in the end of the review).,4,20 October 2018,"The movie started off very exciting and you always wanted to see more of what Michael would do next, however the movie did become predictiable. Michael goes on a scary, at the same time fun killingspree, but i had hoped there would be a plottwist or some kind of deeper plot. When you have watched over half the movie you realize that they just wanted to show you slashing scenes. They did however manage to make pretty good slashing scenes. The creators had no mercy to kill off characters too innocent, young or old. This gives the movie a suspense, because you have no idea who might die or survive.They could easily given some characters a deeper backstory and motive for their actions aswell, but they creators did not care for such things, so some characters (like the doctor) just ended up being completley dumb.The ending is what ruins the movie. The movie goes from this cruel plot and how Michael ruthlessly kills off any character in the movie he comes in contact with, to becomming a girlpower action-movie in the end. I did like what they did with the grandmother's character who had survived Michaels latest killings and the idea of making her some kind of warveteran, but the movie just ended in ridiculous action. It is like we are stuck in time and nothing have changed for decades in movie writing. The main girl characted ALWAYS survives in the end and in this movie it was not just one main girl character that survived but all three of them.

1655,dzwilliams,"Massively overhyped, overpraised, and underwhelming",4,19 October 2018,"I'll start by noting that the 1978 ""Halloween"" has long been my favorite horror movie, and beyond that, generally, one of my favorite movies of all time. I've followed the development, production, and marketing of this sequel very closely and have been rapt with anticipation to see it, given that the director, cast, and crew have long cooed about the project's return to the simplistic menace and terror of the original. Well, I'm not sure what happened to that vision, but it wasn't actualized. And I'm really perplexed as to why audiences and critics are universally lauding it as the sequel ""Halloween"" has deserved for the past 40 years. While I'll openly acknowledge that no sequel could probably do justice to John Carpenter's singular mastery, I dare say that ""Halloween II"" was more tonally consistent with the original (excepting its considerable flaws, including the addition of the bloodline motive and Michael's portrayal as a glacially paced, unkillable bogey), and if we're talking about awaiting a long-overdue Laurie-and-Michael reunion/showdown, I legitimately think ""Halloween H20"" may have surpassed this film in quality had Michael been outfitted with a less laughable and cringe-worthy mask.This film's director, David Gordon Green, has sold himself as a lifelong admirer, lover, and devotee of John Carpenter's original, and while glimmers of that fanboydom shine through periodically, if not continually, they do so in the most ham-handed fashion imaginable (as when Laurie's thrown from a second-story balcony, only to disappear from view immediately thereafter, a la the conclusion of the original). I applaud and was nerdily delighted to see that the opening and closing credits were captured in the same orange font as the original's, but that fact is hardly worth praising when weighed against the sheer stupidity of the bombastic opening sequence (featuring the deplorable British podcasters producers) and the lackluster, anticlimactic conclusion.A lot's been said and reported, too, of this film's significance in its depiction of a female protagonist dealing with the long-term effects of trauma and striving to reclaim her narrative. Fair enough, but that places upon Jamie Lee Curtis the onus of delivering a pretty bare, fierce, and no-holds-barred Laurie Strode performance. And does she? Well, if you've seen the trailers, you've seen the best of it. But JLC can hardly be blamed for the travesty that is hackneyed writing. Perhaps not every traumatized woman would resort to reclusion in a heavily militarized hermitage and restless rumination over and obsession with an event that occurred 40 years earlier. Laurie's struggles with PTSD are every bit the caricature that the ad campaigns suggest, with her booby-trapped home and arsenal of semi-automatic weapons. In point of fact, she feels more like Ellen Ripley or Sarah Connor than Laurie Strode, and whether or not that's a desirable transfiguration is, I guess, in the eye of the beholder.But above all, I think this film's major transgressions are (1) that is isn't in ANY remote way scary, and (2) that it totally fails to capture any of the original film's essence of simplistic creepiness (which was, after all, the entire point and vision behind retconning out the sequel mythology that followed). Lest we forget that, in the original, Michael slit a chick's throat after choking her, stabbed a guy (once), and choked another chick with a telephone cord. Here, he brutally massacres victims in a manner that's totally on-brand for all of the stupid sequels that were so painstakingly left behind: he rips out teeth, decapitates, impales, and bludgeons, much like Rob Zombie's incarnation did. There's nothing simple, sophisticated, or high-brow about anything that's being served here. And while it may be a stretch to categorize any horror movie as ""classy,"" Carpenter's original came damn close to that distinction. The ""genre-defying"" Green is fundamentally a humorist, and I don't think that he and his retinue, despite their admiration of and purported respect for the source material, were up to the task of producing a sequel worthy of the original (and when you forcibly scrap every intervening entry in the franchise, for better or worse, that's an expectation you set).",Halloween
1656,julianvargasrivera,REALLY REALLY GOOD(SPOILERS AHEAD),9,12 September 2018,"Let me start by stating that this movie blew my expectations(in a good way of course). The new theme by John Carpenter is immensely memorable, the cinematography is top-notch, and the kills are intense. For instance, my favorite death is when Michael brutally obliterates his doctor's head(stomps on it repeatedly). However, this is when my problems with the film become apparent. The doctor storyline felt out of place and unnecessary. There was no need for him to set up the bus crash. Just felt out of place. In the end, the movie was the best Halloween movie behind the original. For those wondering, the deaths were brutal, but not obscure like those in the Rob Zombie movies.

Awfully boring movie seen hundreds of times in different type of slasher movies. The only difference is that other horror movies have tension, build up, eire and dark atmosphere as well as an occasional scary scene here and there. This has NONE of it! The funny thing is that the first scene is at the same time the best and the worst scene in the movie. The best in terms of filming and editing. They used old school zoom effect as well as it was nicely edited. The worse in terms of that immediately shows you what to expect. Bunch of cliches, awful dialogues and cheap and predictable situations. Michael being shown way too many times with his mask on didn't help either.

My favourite one was when Jamie Lee Curtis put his head against the door while Micheal was standing right in fron of the house.... Ang guess what? Yeah Michael broke the windows of the door and grabbed her head. This movie is awful, trust me.",Halloween
1664,joepmesman,It is a great sequel but not worth the hype,9,21 October 2018,"I'm a huge fan of the franchise and the original Halloween has been my number one favourite movie of all times. I was so excited for this movie and, based on the reviews, had very high expectations. Well, perhaps a bit to high..
The movie is still entertaining but it is not ""the best horror movie of 2018"", or ""the best Halloween sequel ever"". In my opinion, Halloween 2 and H20 were more intense.
Also, they gave us fans so many trailers and video content to see before the release of the movie, so I kinda already knew what to expect from basically each scene and timeline (meaning, who was ready to be killed next). But, it was obviously my choice to watch all the video content myself ;)",Halloween

They were not - they ranged from on the nose to mostly peripheral. No spoilers - there was only one plot point I was not thrilled with but I imagine it was mostly a slight wink to some of the lesser plots that played out in some of the sequels and was dispatched quickly enough to let this brilliant film thrive on its own. Jamie Lee Curtis is in a class of her own, sending a love letter to her fans and her movie while also giving a heartbreaking performance. Run to see it!!!",Halloween

1671,cfrasu,best of the sequels by far,8,20 October 2018,I say best of the sequels to exclude the Rob Zombie films as those I consider separate. I enjoyed this one as it's references to the original were subtle and appropriate. The film really brings something new to the franchise and I honestly didn't think that was possible. It also leaves with a possibility for more but the film still stands on its own as a sequel to the original film.,Halloween
1672,mineprod,Let's try this again...,10,27 April 2020,"Halloween like it's horror counterparts have not been the most reliable when is comes to continuity or canon. Fans of the franchise have spent countless hours trying to make sense of what has been retconed or just ignored by past writers. It's easy to get frustrated at the series for not making sense at times. The original Halloween (1978) hinted that Michael's psychotic behaviors care from teen promiscuity when he saw his sister having intercourse on Halloween night the original sequel (1981) had us believing Michael had the Devil inside him and he was the brother to Laurie, Jamie Lee Curtis. Then a wide swing in Halloween III, Season of the Witch (1982) taught the viewers that it was the masks that were creating this evil in society. Michael Myers wasn't even the main subject. In future sequels we see the return of Myers and his sister on and off but he was more of just a human that used trickery to return in future sequels. By the time it's all over we are so frustrated in the lack of continuity that Rob Zombie tries to retcon it and we welcome the hopeful change but the style left fans wondering if this was even Halloween at all in the end.Long story longer it brings us to Halloween (2018). No a sequel to the series. But to the original one. Talk about frustrating viewers. You know how dedicated you have to be to a sinking ship in order to be angry that it's happening yet welcome the impending doom that might happen? Fans on the internet made quite a fuss over the fact that they'd dedicated so much of their lives finding sense in the sporadic story line. This story finds Michael and Laurie having never experienced any of the sequels or reboots. This was starting off fresh, a new timeline acting like the was the sequel to the original 1978 Halloween.Michael has been in intense psychiatric wards or the past forty years and inevitably escapes like we knew he would after seeing his mask by a journalist. The journalist's are only in the story as a way for Myers to retrieve his mask. And to show the audience that he is deadlier than ever. Laurie has been preparing her daughter, Karen Stroud, in hand to hand combat, weapons and emergency drills in the literal death trap of a house Laurie has created in preparation in her mind of an impending attack by Myers. this has created a dynamic where the daughter has cut ties with her mother yet Lauri's granddaughter has to keep a secret from her mom in order to see her grandmother. This is a great story that creates the obstacles that we as the audience know Myers is coming but Laurie, her daughter and granddaughter need to start trusting each other again before it's too late to try to defeat Michael Myers.I would recommend Halloween (2018) because it reignited a flame in the story that makes sense. I'm excited to see if we'll get a new movie from this one and hope it's as great.On the Mick-O-Meter five star scale I give it 5-STARS",Halloween
1673,lovelylynda_k,RUBBISH,2,24 October 2018,Why all the raving reviews??? Did we watch the same film??? We've got Jamie Lee Curtis running about like Sarah Connor (terminator 2)!!

1674,nightshade-96931,This isn't that good of a movie.,1,24 October 2018,"I have watched a ton of Horror movies in my life. This wouldn't even rate in my top fifty. There were a few cheesy parts where the camera would have something come around a corner and time it to cause a jump. Then again if you watch Eight Below you might jump with something pops out of a hole as well... That does not make a good movie. The beginning started off ok enough, working the storyline and gets you wondering if Michael will react or when he gets an opportunity if he will actually say something but beyond that I just have to say I was disappointed.Maybe I expect too much but at most I would rate this a three and I was checking my watch twenty minutes in to see how much was left. Near the end it went all derp to me though. So many bad decisions that someone who supposedly trained most of their life for should know better and would have learned that the weapon choices they walked around with were crap at best. For those who don't understand I will put it simply, long weapons work poorly in close quarters situations unless you have multiple people to cover angles. They work great however when you have longer sightlines. So why in the world would you attempt to sweep a house with a lever action rifle?????All I can say is that if The Nun is in theater and you are contemplating going to this and you know even the smallest bit about self defense go to it instead. If you think that officers will always be there to save you this will suit you just fine so enjoy the movie sheeple.",Halloween

(The grandma in a cheap Sarah Connor-like made me laught).I honnestly think that making movies like that is a shame to the horror culture and culture in general.People consume only what their are given without even think.

It had a very original feel to it! Jamie Lee Curtis was nothing short of incredible in this film! The score was the best since the original film. It even threw in some comedy that makes you feel at ease at some points, but that doesn't last long. I have never seen a movie twice in theaters, but that is now going to change. Thank you to everyone who made this film possible! It was for sure one of the best ever made!",Halloween
1686,ralphkeefer,Halloween (2018) offers up a strange blend from a rusty cauldron,2,19 October 2019,"Halloween (2018) is presented with a legitimate, almost shocking, sense of seriousness and reality that none of the other sequels really have going for them. The film contains a downright bone-chilling score, and the best look for Michael Myers since the 1978 classic. Jamie Lee Curtis is badass, vulnerable and powerful in her performance, and shined brightly throughout as well.However, I found it severely lacking in almost every other aspect, unfortunately. Featuring absolutely zero suspense, oppressively unscary, and worst of all.... copying moments from every single sequel that came before while pretending that it was superior to them by erasing their existence. It owes almost every concept within its story to another film in the series. It's shocking how it was played off to be original and worthy of forgetting everything else before it, yet borrowed every beat from another entry.It's a strange film for me because at moments it plays as a shockingly great follow-up, while the rest of the film seems flat and hollow. Still, I hardly know what my rating for the film would be. Having the series back, with a huge following based on those box office numbers, and being treated seriously is amazing. I felt it left a lot to be desired and needed more moments of genuine terror instead of action and shock. No balance.It's certainly a cut above low-tier entries like Halloween Resurrection and Halloween 6, but I'd put it pretty low near the bottom of the pumpkin in ranking. I do love watching any Halloween film in the series, no matter how good and bad they may be, though.All that aside... you bet your last Rabbit in Red match that I'll be seeing Halloween Kills on opening night, as well as any future sequel in the franchise that is made.Overall, I'm half and half like coffee on this promising sequel that was given everything it possible could be to succeed. It almost does, until it fails to conjure up any sort of fear or chill during the musty old story it shoots at you.",Halloween
1687,supernatural-14449,Really Disappointed,3,19 October 2018,"I have loved the Halloween franchise. All of the movies have been great but this one.... I'm very disappointed. I went in with the hopes of being scared and to enjoy this classic return of Michael Myers. I have just walked out of the cinema after seeing it on opening night and felt robbed. It was extremely over hyped for what we got. There was some good elements where it made sense and pieced together well with the previous movies. But it left me feeling like there was a lot missing and that it had been thrown together to make a rushed job.There was barely any scares, and most of it was too dark to even see the screen. I wish there were more real scares. My older sister enjoyed it but she is really easily frightened by horror movies. But I really am disappointed with the whole movie over all. I would not recommend to those who really love the franchise, it'll spoil it all.",Halloween

1692,wmdbrooks,"""What's the Boogeyman...?""",1,29 October 2018,"Well, it certainly isn't Michael Myers in this latest reiteration of the Halloween series.
Basically, it's Jason Voorhees chucking away the hockey mask in exchange for the William Shatner mask. Halloween was more than your run-of-the-mill body count horror movies. It was the fears we had, what lurked in the shadows late at night. What was hunting us as we went about our usual business.
Clearly the new people have chosen to dispel with all of that setting the bar lower.
The Carpenter revised score is harder, more angry. Again lacking the eerie charm the original had.
One redeeming quality I will give is Jamie Lee Curtis's performance. It's first rate as the trauma embattled Laurie Strode looking to resolve unfinished business between herself and Michael.
If the audiences are looking for a Halloween that at least tried to come close to a resemblance of the original, they're going to be deeply disappointed.",Halloween

1694,kcardozavii,As a die hard horror fan...,5,21 October 2018,"Initial thoughts.
Okay, so I am a die hard horror fan. I love the original and rob zombie's remake. And for this being a direct sequel to the original film, it doesn't feel like it..You know how the studio credits roll and lights go down and you settle into your seat. The trailers are finally over and you're excited to watch the opening scene, especially an icon like Michael, but the opening scene here was boring..Like okay, I feel like they're trying to humanize Michael in this movie and that's not okay to me. Michael is the boogeyman. This movie tries to strip that away and make you sympathize for him and not blame him for what happened and blame the mask instead.For the first half of the movie he's not even wearing a mask which doesn't make it scary.
Jamie Lee Curtis needed more screen time and more backstory, beings that it's a direct sequel.
As for the new teens I thought the granddaughter was a good addition but the rest of them were forgettable and you really didn't care about them.
The reporters also, like what was the point of them? After they died their story ended. Like their podcast or something should've blown up on the internet or it should've showed what happened to their show. But once they die the story just moves on and forgets that they were even a part of the story.
The Kills...
The kills were brutal and realistic, but the fact that he didn't have his mask on for most of them, just didn't feel like a Halloween movie.
And then once he put on his mask the kills that did happen were off screen and you just got to see the aftermath.
So what's the point of an R rating?
I liked the Strode's I just felt like Laurie needed more backstory. Not just flashbacks to the daughters childhood.
I can go on about what makes this movie good and what makes this movie bad.
But in the end, it was an ok movie but it wasn't a ""Halloween"" movie.
The aesthetic, the music, Jamie Lee Curtis, and the opening credits are the only thing that saves this in my opinion.
Regardless, It's a good addition and I'm sure I'll buy the dvd and merch and watch it regularly like the others.
Final thought...why did the doctor put on the mask? It honestly made me mad and made me want to leave...but thankfully that scene ended in minutes but like WHY!?",Halloween

(I get it, horror movie, but this was too much)The kills however were pretty good and I applaud the actor that played Michael Myers, because he made the character feel known and familiar. The breathing against the latex mask, the brutal kills (really brutal), but that was it.A friend of mine fell asleep during the movie and our group was laughing a lot because of the dumb decisions and the foretelling of the next scenes.

1707,MikeGrossman34,God awful . . . a complete disappointment.,1,1 November 2018,"Where to begin. This movie was such a complete disappointment. I had high hopes for this film since it was billed as a true sequel to the original. My first clue that this movie would be a flop is when I entered the theater for the only showing on 10/30 and observed that it was nearly empty. On the night before Halloween?? The movie itself required you to suspend so much logic and common sense. Why did Michael Myers have to be moved to a different institution? That wasn't explained. And knowing how dangerous he is, why was he not transported privately with far more precautions? And who's one of his first kills? A child. That's practically taboo in American horror films. While it was interesting to see the film challenge that taboo, the kill was so random and pointless it came off as tasteless.We're told that Laurie Strode is so traumatized about her experience she has spent 40 years reliving the horror and preparing for the day when the Shape comes for her. Why the hell would she have stayed in Haddonfield???? What was holding her there? A sense of duty? That she, and only she, could put a stop to him? Preposterous. And then when she and her daughter are hiding in the basement and the Shape is in the house looking for her, she draws attention to him by shooting into the floorboards?????? Why would she do that? Preposterous. And then this incredibly anticlimactic confrontation we've waited 40 years for and all that happens is that she traps him in the basement and sets the place on fire??? And then doesn't even wait around to make sure he's gone?The movie made this big point about how Myers had the ability to speak but chose to be silent. So you would think that was leading up to something. The Brits tried to get a word out of him and failed. The new Loomis begged him to say something with his dying breath to no avail. Would Laurie be the one person who could reach Myers where everyone else failed? Wouldn't the fans of this franchise appreciate it if she could get one word out of him . . . something for waiting 40 years for this showdown. Nothing. How boring.Was there any merit to this film at all? Any shining light in a sea of blah? Just one - the black kid. He was hilarious. He's got a career ahead of him.

James Jude Courtney's portrayal of ""The Shape"" is fantastic, really enjoyed his performance.The last 15 minutes are good, and what the movie should've been the whole time.The Mask is pretty damn good and there's a scene where he looks straight out of the first movie.Jamie Lee Curtis gives a pretty solid performanceHomages to the first movie are everywhere, but it can come off a little too forced at times.The black kid was hilarious, he should've been in the movie more.Dislikes:
The twist with Michaels Dr was just stupid, I really didn't understand where they were going there.Absolutely ZERO suspense throughout this film!!!! Michael robotically kills people just for the sake of killing..there is no buildup to the kills at all. That really disappointed me!.The ending was weak. Spoilers here. So Laurie traps Michael down in the basement of her house. He is literally just standing there staring at her as she sets her little fire trap off ultimately burning her whole house down (???)...WHY NOT JUST SHOOT HIM IN THE HEAD!!!! we don't see Michael burn, instead it cuts to her and her daughter and granddaughter escaping and it just abruptly ends...wtf???Enough with the sjw subversion points people...it's become annoying to the tenth degree and it's not something I want to see in a Halloween film.Overall it had its moments, but didn't deliver the way I thought it would going in. Starts off strong, and really nose dives towards the ending climax. That whole Dr thing I'll never understand, just a stupid side plot they should've cut out way back suring shooting. I mean it's rob zombies wife on a white horse bad.Michael doesn't stalk anyone!!!! Honestly the closest he comes to a stalker is the bathroom scene where he toys with the British woman. Other than that, he's just a Jason walking around and randomly killing teens mindlessly without and rhyme or reason. Disappointing.5/10. I'm going to see it again just to make sure I'm firm, but I feel very good about my rating. I'm a massive Halloween fan who had huge hopes for this film, and I came out let down. Go see it, and judge for yourself.",Halloween

1716,samsnavely,Weak,4,21 October 2018,"Kind of dumb. Its basically a remake of H20 (like that was necessary) written by Danny McBride (what does he know about horror).....Rob Zombie's version was way better.
Same weak plot. I'm surprised Carpenter put his name on this. Jamie Lee Curtis/Laurie has ptsd from her run in with Michael Myers from so many years before but everyone thinks she is irrational until he breaks out and starts slicing up babysitters again. Only difference is 20 years, lack of imagination and LL Cool J. At least Rob Zombie did something original with the source material and explored the psychology of something like that. Direct to video snore fest cash grab repackaged as a blockbuster release because........they can get your money if they get Jamie Lee and Carpenter to sign off. Should have at least tried something original with a talent like McBride.....maybe make it a dark comedy? Idk stick to what you know.

The Halloween franchise was good but started getting less and less enjoyable as the series progressed, and I have no idea why they even made Halloween 3. However, Halloween 2018 was a great sequel! It stood toe to toe with the original. Jamie Lee Curtis is a badass in this movie! It really shows the toll all of the encounters with Michael took on her but she has fight left in her.

1718,bobbyirby,Had so much potential,4,20 October 2018,"As a true Halloween series fanatic, I went in expecting way more than I bargained for. The reviews and trailer definitely duped me. This movie jumped all over the place unnecessarily. Too many cut scenes. He killed just as many people on screen as he did off screen. I dont understand the so called ""twist"" with his doctor now becoming a killer. That definitely didn't add anything, if any, it confused me even more. Of course some of the characters did the silliest things, the police were inept, the town's Sheriff was a waste of screen time, and the ending was horrid.What I did like about the new Halloween was Michael's appetite for killing and his shear ruthlessness. Some didn't like the fact that he didn't stalk his victims long enough. I however loved the fact that there was no stalking involved, no time wasted staring at you, and hiding in the dark shadows. He just went for the kill. If he saw you, you were as good as dead.Overall, I wasnt thoroughly impressed and It could've been a much better film. There was such great potential with this but it was wasted.",Halloween
1719,shanonmcnab,Movie has it's flaws,3,26 June 2019,"The movie has some flaws. The first being Laurie Strode has a son not a daughter let's not forget Halloween H2O. This movie isn't clearly a remake as Strode is a grandmother and Mike Myers kill count in the movie is mentioned only as 5 as he adds to the number as the movie goes on. Dr. Loomis has passed away but is referred in the movie as calling Michael Myers a monster with a 5 kill count when Serial killers have a higher number and how will it ever fit into Halloween H2O in the franchise?
The cast I found was poorly chosen like Laurie Strodes daughter and her daughters husband clearly don't fit as a couple and Laurie Strodes granddaughter and her boyfriend are not compatible either and neither is the creepy friend. I just found that the husband, boyfriend and creepy friend could've be played by more compatable actors for the movie. It just seemed like a rush job on character selection unlike Rob Zombies version of Halloween.",Halloween

I would agree with that. The problem is that saying as much is like saying having the common cold is better than having stage 3 terminal brain cancer.The last few entries to the Halloween franchise have been dumpster fires, so saying that this is better is only mildly appraising. In all actuality, what we have is yet another run of the mill slasher flick complete with all of Hollywoods typical BS to go along with it. Overused comic relief, poor character development, and lack of any real suspense or tension, all attempting to be masked by graphic CG and some pretty solid acting.I will say though, that any scene with Michael or Laurie was really fascinating and well worth seeing, especially in the last half-hour, which included some great nods to the series roots as well as the badass final showdown between Michael and Laurie. All in all, it's not horrible, but wait until you can rent it for $5 on Prime Video. Don't waste money on tickets and popcorn.",Halloween

I was happy to hear that this Halloween would be a recalibration of the series rather than a reboot. This movie definitely lives up to all of the hype and does not disappoint. I have seen all of the original movies and can say that you do not have to watch the originals to enjoy and understand this one. I can honestly say that I left the theatre with zero negatives about this movie, and I wish that it was another hour or two longer. The suspense was nonstop, but not too intense. It was not saturated with humor like many current horror movies tend to be, but cleverly timed the comedic moments to allow recovery from sequences of terror. The storyline was also as unpredictable as slasher movies can get, so I left pleasantly surprised with the creativeness of the plot. This movie is a MUST watch for any kind of horror fan. I will even go as far to say that this movie should be watched by everybody, so they can see what a perfect revival of a legendary franchise is.

Comparing this to Halloween H20, it was a lot more believable that Laurie strode would fake her own death and move to California instead of staying in haddonfield for 40 years. There were a few scary parts but mostly just frustrating that the characters were so stupid. I love Jamie lee Curtis and I love the original but this one didn't even come close.

1741,john_baldaccino,It's was ok. Could've been better,7,27 October 2018,"I wish this movie was a 10/10. I was really hoping for an amazing sequel. It's not terrible but it could've been better. Any Halloween fan would probably agree that Halloween H20 was the best sequel in the series and the perfect ending possible. So H20 still remains the best sequel/ending for me.Jamie-Lee does a great job with the Laurie Strode character in this movie, however, I found her booby-trapped house a bit over the top for a guy that tried to kill her on one night 40 years ago. He's apparently not her brother, so to set her house up like that, waiting for him, seemed a little too much.Michael Myers vs Laurie Strode fight was not long enough. There was a lot of build up to it but I wanted more of a fight between the two. That's what we were all waiting for after all.The ending..... nothing can beat the ending of H20 when she decapitates him with an axe. That WAS and I think will remain the best way to end the series. When it returned after H20, I was disappointed that they went back on that ending. But this ending... well, does not compare at all to H20. It leaves some questions open and of course, the possiblility of him returning. I really hope it doesn't come back again. Don't get me wrong. The more Myers vs Strode, the better. But I don't want them to destroy the storyline. Unless of course they can top the ending and put the series to bed once and for all. I still feel it should've ended at H20.",Halloween
1742,shenmuephoenix,Brilliant sequel and the best one along with Halloween II.,8,21 October 2018,"Halloween (2018) is truly worthy of the Halloween franchise. This is certainly not true some might say, with a few past releases.
I enjoy anything Halloween, but a few of the entries, notably Resurrection for one, were not good at all and cheapened the series, in my mind.
This is not true at all with Halloween 2018 and everyone involved deserves a lot of praise for delivering the best Halloween film, along with Halloween II and since the original.
Nothing can compare to John Carpenter's original, but this film does a damn good job at trying. And it may win over a few sceptics in the process.With the welcome return of Jamie Lee Curtis and John Carpenter, Halloween 2018 packs a mighty punch.
There is an extraordinary attention to detail, that reflects the level of care taken with the film. The clever camera work and different views are at times terrifying. Same can be said of a few of the quicker type kills and the build up and aftermath on show.
There are real vibes of the ""lunatic has escaped the asylum"" and the chaos that ensues, is truly gripping.The acting throughout is great, as is the score from Carpenter, which really racks up the level of anxiety while watching.
Jamie Lee Curtis' character brings a great sense of a broken being and someone who seems to have lost everything. Her acting, with strong conviction, really brought across the tormented soul of Laurie Strode.I'm a big fan of the Youtube Channel ""We Watched A Movie"" and they are massive fans like me, of the Halloween franchise.
They remarked on their channel about many characters being likeable and being sorry to see some go, during the film.
This is very true and a very clever device, which made many kills even more harrowing. Certain characters felt like actual rounded people rather than cardboard cutouts, as some slasher type films have opted for in the past.
This would be credit to the script and the acting, of even minor characters in the film.As some critics may have also said, Michael Myers showed a level of brutality comparable with the later films and the same kind of creepy stealthiness, which was apparent in the first film.Everyone can have a different viewpoint, but I thought all actors and actresses involved, accounted for themselves brilliantly.
The best compliment I can give, is that nobody felt out of place as such, or was there as a ""token"" character.There were a lot of great nods to other films in the franchise and they kept a good feel of Halloween throughout. Comparable possibly, to the real seasonal vibes of Halloween 4.Nothing is over done, but the way it is done, is chilling and brutal.
There is a level of entrenched in reality which makes parts of Halloween 2018 very scary indeed.
As with the original regarding Michael Myers, there is a level of, is he real or is he supernatural?
The film cleverly doesn't lead itself down a dead end, as with Halloween 5. It keeps things simple, yet perfectly so.
Sometimes the beauty is in the simplicity and it's this gritty style which remains true to the originals.I strongly recommend Halloween (2018) to all die-hard fans of the series. It is just my opinion and that alone, but if you call yourself a fan of the series, then there is no massive reason why you will not enjoy this great entry.Congratulations to all involved, in what is an impressive entry in the Halloween series.",Halloween
1743,Social-Justice,Poor predictable outing weakens franchise,6,24 October 2018,"Grotesque unclever volgarity lose this film any sense of creative cinematic horror. Halloween fans have been sold down the river with this weak, predictable and withdrawn outing for Micheal Myers. Creating parody shots from the original only further induce a lack of creative imputus on a franchise which could easily have brought the suspense of the original to older fans, whilst engaging a new generation. However, weak scripting, poor predictable acting, overly visual gore at the cost of sensory suspense, leave this film diluted in an array of failed reboots, relying heavily on fans to fill cinemas whilst never rewarding the loyalty with a true cinematic experience in this genre and epic Halloween franchise. The only winners here, yet again, are corporate profits. Shameful! Lets hope this time Michael Myers is dead, but sadly I suspect, like profit over production value, he is not!",Halloween

The music/score of the film did dissapoint me. I had listened to it twice before seeing the film but didn't want to give an opinion until seeing how it matched up with the film. It works for a few scenes but overall it feels forced and they can get rid of the ""tikka tikka"" that underlies a few of the tracks.

1758,jimanctil,Uninspired boring disappointment,5,21 October 2018,"I watched the original Halloween with my daughter a few days before seeing this movie. With the original fresh in my mind, I was able to get the many references to that film in this movie, but also see how this movie fails in its story telling and directing.
The original was genuinely creepy and frightening with minimal actual violence and hardly any gore. I'm not saying that violence and gore necessarily detract from a good horror movie, but this movie is a rampage of violence without any real story telling. It's boring.
Jamie Lee Curtis' character is not very believable. She was intelligent and strong in the first movie but apparently her one evening of violence left her so emotionally scarred that she has dedicated her life to a possible final confrontation with her demon. This plot line weakens her character and removes any sympathy that the audience may have had for her.
Her son in law is a dope who baits mouse traps after he sets them. Her daughter is any annoying whiner who for some reason leaves an arsenal of guns in the basement in the final scene, thus having to finish off Michael with a kitchen knife and a fire trap. Her granddaughter is a moron who doesn't retrieve her cell phone from a bowl of party mush (we know it is not liquid because the phone was still working after it was dropped in), and runs into the woods when Michael is attacking instead of towards the police, down the road, down the driveway to her grandmother's house, or any other more logical escape. In short, the main characters are as dumb as any other stereotypical slasher movie characters. Any other characters are killed off or exit the movie before you can care for them.
I was a child in the seventies. I remember seeing, as a child or young adult, the original and ground breaking movies that launched so many franchises, like Star Wars, Rocky, Jaws, Alien, Halloween. This latest Halloween movie is one more regurgitation of the same themes and plot lines that has become an insult to the intelligence of my generation.",Halloween

1765,cadeis-1,"Once again we get ""Walking Killing Machine""",4,4 November 2018,"Michael is the terminator and Laurie is Sarah Conner only this story takes place on Halloween. That's pretty much what this film is. He just walks around kills people then battles Laurie in her house that she has spent 40 years rigging with traps. The end.Not scary. No atmosphere or creepiness that the 1978 film had. Why not make a Halloween film where the characters don't even know who Michael Myers is. That's one thing that made the original so interesting. They didn't know who this guy was. He was almost like a ghost. I say make a film like that. Dark and scary similar to The Strangers only with Michael Myers. No Haddonfield. No Laurie Strode or anyone related to her. A new storyline with new characters.As for this film it may have been better if they started the film showing how they captured Michael Myers. Did they just show up and arrest him? Or maybe have Laurie go see Michael. Anything but having those annoying English reporters there and one yelling at him. It was a bit absurd. Jamie Lee Curtis was okay in the film but I didn't have the same simpathy for her character in this film as I did in the original. The only character I kind of liked in this film was the sheriff. The whole deal with the new doctor didn't make any sense at all by the way.The film is a step up from part 5, 6, and resurrection but that's about it.

1767,andershamstad,Horrifying bad,2,28 October 2018,"The only scary thing about this movie is how bad it is. Its bland, generic and really poorly constructed. It´s been a long time since I've watched a movie in this genre, because I've watched so many bad and easily forgettable horror movies. And this certainly didn't help.The storyline is amazingly both predictable and badly constructed. The characters are easily forgettable, and not likable at all. This, with the great support of poor acting, results in a movie where you just can´t wait for the characters to get killed and the movie to end. No big surprises, no scares, no funny moments, nothing to remember at all. Just another predictable, bad movie with no originality, quality or anything to it. Just utter meaningless.Spend your money on something else people!",Halloween

Being a huge Halloween fan myself, I was immensely happy to see how well they respected the source material and the characters. Fantastic job to the entire team on this film.

Ignore the poor reviews, if you are a true horror fan you will love this, The movie kept the authentic feel of the original, whilst ensuring it kept up with the times.

1779,jivanjack,Pathetic,1,29 October 2018,This movie is a garbage horror movie thats milking off of the halloween name. It made no sense and made michael a joke. There was no suspense or chase scenes just boring one stab killings with a pathetic effort to kill michael at the end. This movie was pathetic. Do not waste your time,Halloween
1780,catjbrownstone,Expect a comedy,3,19 October 2018,Worst dialogue ever. Really disappointed with everyone's performance and the lack of creativity with most of the kill scenes and jump-scares. It was as though McBride tried copy the style of the Rob Zombie films but did a horrible job. The movie seemed as though it was written and directed by someone who is unfamiliar with the original franchise. Danny McBride should stick to comedy because that is all this film was.. A joke.,Halloween
1781,claudiatavares,Disappointing,6,21 October 2018,"Well...I loved the ending. The random killing was a turn off, yes I know in the original he did kill random people BUT there was a motive, and in this one there isn't. Not to mention that they finally reveal Laurie isn't related to Michael at all!!! So then why chase her for 40 years?! Maybe someone can help me understand, but overall I was expecting more. Jamie lee Curtis was awesome though! There was a lot of cool bits and pieces and the original song brought total nostalgia!",Halloween
1782,Welkin_One,Halloween: Again?,5,10 September 2018,"We saw this at the TIFF World Premiere and felt it to be a decent slasher and a serviceable Halloween film but it really fails to deliver on a story or mood that justifies the return of the incredible Jamie Lee Curtis. 
The kills are plentiful, as are the jokes. 
The gore looks great post-kill but most kills are either off-screen or barely shown aside from a couple glory shots which do satisfy. 
Overall, as a Halloween fan, you will probably enjoy the watch but what this movie entirely wants to do - was already done 100 times better with the epic finale of Halloween H20. 
The main problem with this movie is that it lacks a why, a purpose. 
In the end, a decent horror film, meh Halloween entry. Not quite a recommend but still fun enough for slasher fans. Plus, Jamie Lee Curtis makes it watchable as long as it isn't Halloween: Resurrection.",Halloween
1783,markgibson-10982,Danny McBride's Halloween,6,19 October 2018,"Halloween has always been my favorite horror series. I love the first 3 but after that the movies kept getting worse and worse. So I wasn't sure what to expect with this especially with Danny McBride involved. I've always been a fan of his work especially East Bound and Down. He has a unique style that follows him from project to project as it did here but oddly enough it worked here. There was a surprising amount of comedy in this film that didn't feel out of place and was actually funny. As a huge fan of the original I thought this movie did a terrific job of updating the story to the modern day. You could feel the tension in the theatre and the crowd reaction felt more like a sporting event because they were so into the movie. The suspense in this is incredible, maybe even possibly matching the original.This film has a lot of positives going for it. First off after Halloween 2 I've always felt Michael lost his mystery and ruthlessness, becoming more over the top and cartoonish. Now we have the return of the Shape, pure evil and it's amazing. Secondly there are so many great scenes to the film. Besides the ending which got the crowd going there was another part that was very unexpected that also got a huge reaction. I was so happy to see this film not follow the generic formula of horror movies we've been seeing for the past two decades. This time we have it done well. It references the original while still making the story fresh with things like quality characters, atmosphere and a killer soundtrack by John Carpenter himself. Finally the kid getting baby sat is the best non Michael highlight. He is hilarious giving us some of the best dialogue of the film.I really only had one strong flaw with this film as a whole. There was no real clear explanation as to how the original ended and how we end up here 40 years later. The original ends with Michael on the loose but here they just say he was captured that night. It didn't really make sense since he was just got stabbed in the eye, shot off a balcony, disappeared and then some how got captured. It just didn't click with me.Overall I strongly recommend this film. It has beautiful cinematography. As well as plenty of well placed humor, classic gore and genuine suspense. Welcome addition to the series, I'd love to see Danny McBride return on a sequel or spinoff.",Halloween
1784,clarkkellog,Don't understand the bad reviews,10,21 October 2018,"If you are a fan of the series you will love this enstallment. I've seen every other enstallment at least 5 times over. THIS IS THE BEST SEQUEL TO DATE. In ways I thought it was better than the original. The only thing that could have made it better would have been if it had Donald Pleasance back as Dr Loomis. (Which is what/who carried most of the sequels)
Jamie Lee Curtis steps up big time to fill that void. People that are saying it is a comedy, must have a very morbid sense of humor. Perhaps they enjoy pointless, plotless, snuff films like Hostel & Saw; and consider it horror. But, for the true horror conosuier - who appreciates mythology, good acting, and great storytelling - you will be delightfully terirified...",Halloween

Michael Myers is brought back so well and he is chilling as hell. All of the characters are believable and likeable (something that slashers don't tend to do well) and Jamie Lee Curtis is an absolute tour de force.

Is a good movie. BUT it's in my opinion they, tried to fix something that didn't need fixing.Number one is that I hate is that they took away the story of Michael and Laurie not being related. Is a joke to me because it's like what's Michael's motive now, them being related Was a good story should of Stuck with it,and was not a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis turning in Rambo.Number 2 character development Well there is none. For example what's the point of the child and the babysitter? Well it was put into the story for Comedy relief and I just don't think it needed to be there. And the bloke that was looking after Michael in the asylum,Well am glad he's gone. Because when I was watching this movie and that stupid seen in the police car and the doctor decide to put Michael Mask On I thought we had a bit of the thorn trilogy coming back
but Honestly there was nothingGood things about this movie I have to say that Jamie Lee Curtis was good in this movie decides turning into Rambo. And I have nothing bad to say about Michael Myers He was really good in this movie. Love the kills
loved everything about him.
And of storyI've have to say that Halloween H20 is a much better movie, better story line, and better ending between Michael and Laurie But as a fan still go and see this movie because it's still a good time.

1793,vhristov-81024,"So much perfection, so much thought...I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THIS MOVIE!",10,21 October 2018,"I see that the review section of Halloween consists of either very negative or very positive reviews. While it may be true that the hype might influence a person's opinion, the fact that it did live up to the excitement of viewers and led them to writing a 10/10 review speaks for the movie itself. Anyway I am going to keep this free of any spoilers and also as short as possible cause long reviews are too boring and tryhard. Halloween does pay a tribute to the first movie and it has a great amount of references to it. Also it is filled with metaphors, symbols, foreshadowing, scenes that have hidden messages and deeper meanings. This horror DOES NOT use cheap and stupid jumpscares to unnerve the viewer but rather builds up tension and inflicts terror slowly and throughout the whole movie. And yes, it is true that there are little doses of humor so it would not be gloomy and completely serious but that is nothing that compromises the movie or that makes it less great, scary, etc. Oh no, this review is getting long but i ain't finished yet! Jamie Lee Curtis surprises everyone with great acting and badass scenes, Michael Myers does his job perfectly - he stalks, he is sneaky, he is scary, he is brutal, and oh boy he is angry and obsessed with Laurie. Other characters fit in well and help with the not-that-smooth but truly smart development of the movie. Overall, I am so proud and happy that I went and saw Halloween. It is a slasher the way it is supposed to be done and it is worth every cent that you are going to pay.",Halloween

Historically the music is unforgettable, original and in this one, I thought, ""did they team up with The Purge?"", I don't want to give anything away for people who haven't seen it, but I'm sorry, ""spoiler alert"" It should have ended with ""JLC telling her daughter (who BTW had the initials of KS? Really?) to leave she staying behind with him to make sure he died and that way it puts Halloween (Carpenter) to rest.

1797,jdamaso-50871,"Extremely, extremely overrated by overhyped fans. VERY disappointing.",4,18 October 2018,"*Very minor spoilers*I saw this at H40 last weekend. When I left the screening I couldn't help but feel as if there's been a lot of marketing and misdirection thrown out there about this film, because watching the trailers and then the film itself it becomes obvious that Halloween (2018) was heavily reworked and edited.Aside from that, the script is laughably bad (wait until you meet one of the new doctors from Smith's Grove and Allyson's horribly written father, Toby), the character of The Shape has been reduced to a really dumb, careless random murderer behind a mask (goodbye stalking scenes), the pacing of the film feels entirely like an action movie and lacks the ""slow burn"" of the original, and some characters just disappear from the story and you never hear from them again. It is NOT at all the dark, brooding film suggested in trailer #2.Only positives, for me: Andi Matichak is fantastic, as are many of the teen actors. The first 1/3 is actually very good. When Michael arrives in Haddonfield, however, the subpar writing and direction really begins to reveal itself.Overall, it's so disappointingly bad. The positive reviews seem somewhat disingenuous, probably because of the #metoo subplot (which is nice, but doesn't in and of itself make a film ""good"") and less of a reflection of the actual quality of the movie overall. All of the TIFF viewers that raved about this should be ashamed, they clearly got caught up in being at the premiere and having the actors in their presence, so they overhyped the movie to the rest of us.So, so disappointed. The original ""Halloween II,"" somehow, is the far superior film.",Halloween

Without spoiling anything, It not only was an amazing standalone horror film, but it was a great film for returning fans. This was truly the sequal Michael deserved. Having returning cast members and character storylines, as well as a bit of humor, Easter eggs for fans, and a perfect ending, this was truly an amazing addition to the Halloween story.

Didn't really care for the new doctor, and I was delighted to see the shape share the same feeling. All in all I loved it, still on the fence about the ending though, good to see an Akkad, Carpenter, Curtis and Castle come together for this film and among the several nods to the other movies it was awesome seeing a reference to Halloween 3, which is probably my second favorite of the whole franchise!",Halloween

The actors perform horribly in some points. In my theatre more people laughed than jumped out of their seats, ten times over. There are too many jokes and not enough scares, barely any at all. A lot of this movie seems as though the just needed to fill up the script to get it to an hour and forty minutes.

For a film that wants us to forget everything that happened after the original, it's not nearly good enough. It would pass as just another sequel, though... (in terms of quality).I did appreciate that they didn't overuse the F bomb every five seconds... and there certainly are a few stylish scenes and scares, but the whole thing felt shaky at best.Spoiler ALERT here: The whole Dr. Sartain going crazy only to be killed himself shortly thereafter was the most pointless subplot in a Halloween movie ever and Will Patton deserved a better death, quite frankly. Way too stupid.Anyway, I'm done here. No way anyone with a critical eye or longtime fan gave this 10/10, they had to have been paid because it's just not that good.

Best in the Series,10,20 October 2018,"I truly enjoyed this movie after recently watching every single one of the Halloween movies with the exception of Halloween 3 which has nothing to do with anything. After 40 years, they have done a good job of honoring the first film while giving just enough to make it fresh and entertaining. There is some comedy but it is far and in between so don't listen to the others who are complaining.A lot of attention was given to the story while not complicating itself with too much detail; trust me, this is a good thing as it adds a lot of mystery to the mythos of who this killer is.Also, there is an interesting point made about the mask....that is all that I will say.Overall, this is a great horror movie and you will enjoy it unless you have some sort of brain damage....or you are a liberal....which equates to brain damage.",Halloween

The only scares are cheap tricks. Myers doesn't act like the original Myers. He's not even scary -- I didn't think that was possible, but they managed it.I rank the Zombie movies last, but this is right there with Resurrection as the worst of the others. However, I can re-watch Resurrection, as bad as it is.

The movie should have concentrated more on Laurie and less on her grandchild. All of the young cast except Allyson were unremarkable and badly written. The ending siege saved the film and makes this a rewatch. The dread that made the original so great wasn't there. Also, I never got a Halloween feel which the original had in spades. I won't give away any spoilers but one character nearly brought the movie to a screeching halt. This character acts in a completely ridiculous manner. I am being rather hard on Halloween because I was expecting something spectacular. On the plus side there were several easter eggs from previous Halloween movies and I especially liked the several callbacks the original. Several times Laurie is seen doing actions Michael did in the original. Overall not bad not great but okay. On a final note saw it with a full audience Friday and there was little to no reaction thru the entire movie. A rather flat experience. Looking forward to Suspiria next",Halloween

The camera angles made it as if this was a camera crew who did those episodes of mtv cribs.

He walked funny and the movie had jokes? Then major plot twist just mentioned off hand? This did not live up to the original and I believe scoring had a lot to do with it. Too modern and just turned him into a psycho who kills kids, Michael doesn't kill kids nor does he torture his prey but in this crap of a movie he does. Just call it something else if you're gonna change everything. Oh yeah not a Michael movie because they changed the shapes character but some guy claims he was there the first night and stopped loomis from killing Michael.. uh no you weren't. So young people who have no idea who Michael is go for it but if you love Halloween and know what rob zombie did was a tragedy, save your money.",Halloween

1824,winstonsmith-08223,I have no idea why this has been getting rave reviews,1,21 October 2018,"This movie was what I expected it to be. A hokey plot with thin characters including Michael. As another reviewer pointed out this movie tries to be TOO MANY THINGS and FAILS at all of them.It also relies on too many throwbacks to the original classics that everyone has seen before and so there is zero newness to it.Again, it was what I expected out of hollywood these days....a thin storyline that has shallow characters who you don't really care if they live or die.I think it is really pathetic that people were obviously paid or told to go out and hype this film as something other than the mediocre failure it is.I'm not saying it's terrible, it's just not what it is hyped up to be, but we all knew that is par for the course these days.Do yourself a favor and save yourself the hassle and rent Halloween or Halloween 2, or even Halloween H20 OR even Halloween 3 any of which are better than this movie that is just not that good at all.",Halloween
1825,dylan-48889,Blumhouse Production,3,21 October 2018,"This movie was a huge letdown, I am a Halloween fanatic, the original 1978 film was and always will be a masterpiece and most of the original 5 (excluding season of the witch) were all great films, this movie being directed by John Carpenter gave me hope that it was going to be a modern version of his great movies, but I was sadly disappointed in thinking so. This movie was a blumhouse production and was fitting to all other films they produce, most well known being the insidious series, Annabelle, and the conjuring. This movie was very dark, hardly any daytime scenes, it relies on a lot of dark, silent to quickly loud and violent jump scares, most of which are EXTREMELY easy to predict, the plot, if you have any horror movie knowledge, is relatively predictable as well. Overall, I didn't care for this movie because of the blumhouse spin that was put on it, it was quick, lacked a really good story, and was not a scary film itself, but instead was too worried about jumpscares to focus on an actual scary movie. Very big let down!",Halloween

Easily the worst film of 2018 and the lousiest decision of anyone who contributed to the film. I always thought Curtis was an awful actress, I now know for sure. Do not touch this turd.",Halloween
1829,DireWolf12,It has a groovy vibe,8,21 October 2018,"After spending some time reflecting on this film and reading the polarizing reviews posted on this fine site my conclusion is simply this: I liked this iteration of Halloween.Admittedly I went to the theatre opening night with boat loads of trepidation. I left the theatre feeling amply satiated. It far exceeded my expectations. It is atmospheric and scary with a nice moody vibe maintained throughout feeling, in some ways, like Halloween 4 which I've always enjoyed. The odes to Halloweens gone bye are tasteful and appropriately used. As a fan I appreciated them immensely.I even kinda liked the Sarah Connorization of Laurie. Jamie Lee's alternate version of traumatized Laurie works well given the context. It's very different than H2O and though I liked that film, I enjoyed this Laurie more.My only criticism lies in the Vicki scene. Overall I thought it was particularly well done I just wish the f bomb wasn't used as a way of inserting comedy to a scene that was meant to be frightening and gruesomely macabre. In my opinion it did not work well in the new It film and it does not work here.It's an entertaining movie that I'm glad to have seen on the big screen. I can't wait to read what Luisito Gonzales thinks about this movie. He must be one of the biggest Halloween fans on the planet.",Halloween
1830,nanacj,Great remake or whatever they're calling it.,8,21 October 2018,"I loved this movie, I loved the original, I loved Halloween II, I kinda got away from slasher movies after that. This was really a fun movie for me. Went as a ""family"" outing (4 generations)! I thought the movie was as good as the first, Jamie Lee Curtis brought back her scream queen roll, and Michael was perfect. There were a few folks the movie really could have done without (like the doc & reporters) and a few questions left unanswered, like what happened to Julian? Michael killed everybody else in the house, but I don't recall seeing Julian at all in the aftermath. Anyway, I loved it!",Halloween
1831,calgee-98188,A great new take on tradition,7,21 October 2018,"Halloween 2018 brings a whole new life to a character who all horror movies fans hold dear to their heart. Laurie Strode, who has spent the last four decades preparing for the impending final show down with her nemesis Michael Myers, quite clearly suffering from PTSD and extreme anxiety (especially with her family). To see the transformation of Jamie Lee Curtis's portrayal from 1978 to now, is truly incredible.
Halloween 2018 takes an entirely different approach than the original (plus all the sequels) on the subject of a psychopathic serial killer. Halloween 1978, was a fun, exhilarating, eerie mixture of a brilliantly scripted storyline, perfectly timed jump scares and death scenes, with a very minimal amount of blood shead so that the theatre of the mind was what gave Halloween its reputation.
Halloween 2018 is much more in depth and at times, quite disturbing in the way it portrays Michael as much more of a human rather than an entity. One of the most powerful scenes, was when Laurie Strode was stood outside, knowing that Michael was being transported to a new mental institution. Although the bus journey was supposedly heavily secured and monitored by police, Laurie could feel deep in her soul that something was not right and that Michael was going to come back and find her one way or another.The only negatives for this film would be that most of the death scenes are more or less the same. Michael was very quick to dispose of his victims rather than to scare them before he would inevitably kill them. In the original 1978 Halloween, there was a huge emphasis on Michael stalking his victims before confronting them which gave Michael his scare factor. Halloween 2018, although saw more deaths than the original, they were all very abrupt and very little atmospheric and suspenseful formula was used.On a side note, I feel if you are going to srap sequels to an original film, the new sequel needs to be better than all the other sequels. Halloween 2018 was better than Halloween 3 up to Halloween resurrection. However, Halloween 2 (1981) I feel is still the best sequel. It might have been a smarter idea to do a sequel to Halloween 1 and 2 since they both go hand in hand. Halloween 2018 was not good enough to completely ignore Halloween 2. Halloween 2 is probably one of the only slasher sequels in history that lives up to its original. Halloween 2 was scary, suspenseful and lots of fun. Unfortunately Halloween 2018 (although good) does not supersede Halloween 2.Overall, a great film and a breath of fresh air after all the disappointing and sometimes laughable sequels (except for Halloween 2 which still holds its own as a fantastic original sequel). Jamie Lee Curtis is phenomenal and a true display of female power and determination. Is it the greatest horror movie of all time? Absolutely not. Definitely should not have scrapped Halloween 2. But after decades of disappointing sequels and duplicants, this movie is pretty darn good. Definitely recommend seeing it if you haven't already.",Halloween
1832,oddmediagroupllc,Fun and worth viewing but leaves me wanting more.,7,21 October 2018,"I was really looking forward to this movie and honestly was somewhat let down. Maybe the story has been remade so many times that we are left with unrealistic expectations. To be a sequel, I felt like they tried to relive too many moments from the previous Halloweens. The asylum, people following Michael's story, the bus wreck, etc. It all seemed similar to what we have seen before. I was really wanting to see a fresh look with new ideas. Why not have Laurie be diagnosed with a terminal disease and her mission is to kill Michael for the safety of her daughter and grandchildren? I'm just saying I felt like they could have continued the story but had fresh ideas.There were also odd scenes that felt out of place. Dr. Sartain's character was very annoying which made his scenes hard to watch. Throughout the movie the Doctor and the Journalist kept referring to following the Michael Meyer's case. What was there to follow? The guy has been in an asylum for decades and Laurie became a doomsday prepper. To have spent 40 years of their life consumed by this case just seems boring.One last note, if you are going to kill Michael Meyer's then do it. The way Laurie had been preparing for this day I would have thought she would have a more sure proof way to end it. The use of a wood chipper seems to be really under utilized in horror movies. Just saying. 🤷‍♂️Overall the movie kept my attention and was easy to view regardless if you have followed the franchise or if this was your first movie.OMG rating 7/10",Halloween
1833,melodicjimmy-14781,AWFUL. TERRIBLE.,1,22 October 2018,"I've been a fan of this series since the early 80's. I've watched every new sequel that's come out since then (except the Zombie films, no thanks).Although each film got further and further from the original's intent and style, they STILL felt CONNECTED to the original. Maybe off course at times (H6), but you knew it was that universe.This new one is awful. Michael walks around Haddonfield in plain sight, blatantly killing people for absolutely no reason. Once in Haddonfield, he enters the homes of two women and violently murders them. It's absolutely pointless. He only kills five people in the original movie: Lynda, Bob, Annie, the guy driving the truck for his mechanic outfit and Judith Myers (15 years earlier). But, there's a LOGIC to his murders. There's a REASON. It's not just because he feels like it. This movie has him killing people like he's playing a video game.There's no suspense or tension. One woman is pulling down shades, Michael grabs her hair from behind and slans a huge knife through her neck. Why? Michael wouldn't do that. It's completely out of character.There's a ridiculous plot twist. Dr. Loomis' student took over as Michael's doctor after Loomis died. Halfway through the film, the doctor reveals that he's obsessed with why Michael kills, wants to know what it feels like and murders the Deputy of the police force as he's about to finally kill Michael. Then, Michael beats the doctor up and stomps on his head, completely crushing it like a watermelon (blood, brain matter, mush everywhere). It's disgusting and serves absolutely no purpose. The doctor is never mentioned again.Here's the biggest problem: Michael gets trapped in Laurie's basement, like a prison. They light the house on fire and exit the house. They signal a nearby pickup truck who just HAPPENS to be driving down this ultra remote road that no one ever drives down. But, they don't stay and make sure Michael is actually dead. They just leave.This movie is terrible. Halloween Resurrection makes more sense. I'm not kidding.",Halloween

Without getting into spoiler zone the bad things with the movie are:
-STORY. The story is very basic, very mediocre. The people, the police, the whole town are so stupid you actually root for the killer to slash the mall just so you can go home. Their actions are so bad, you will face-palm yourself once every minute
-CHARACTERS- this story has some interesting characters that could have improved the plot alot, but they are killed very fast, their potential going to waste
-COMEDY-this movie has some funny scenes that made me giggle from time to time
-HORROR- this I think is the most non-horror horror movie I ever saw...nothing about it was scaryConclusion. If you never saw a Halloween movie, don't start now. You will save your time and your money.",Halloween

He's been resurrected by inane scripts, money grubbing hollywood producers and the story of myers has been recycyled, repackaged to various forms. The campy sequels literally reek of cheese. None of them even come close to the horror simplicity of the original. Until now...This movie can be summed up as a rollercoaster ride with dips and turns and leaving you without almost taking a breath. The artistic merits of this movie has to be acknowledged. Mr. Green knows his way around the camera. The opening is erratic perfection while the track sequence of myers roaming around in hadonfield is what true horror movies are made of. Fortunately, i wanted more of this track sequence. I do think he could of added more atmosphere such as to remind us that it's Halloween. I would of loved to see Laurie dazing outside watching the leaves drop and focusing on those dreary mannequins. It would of given the movie a looming sense of dread which was the centerpiece of the original.All in all, Mr. Green knows how to do horror right. This is HIS Halloween - treats wrapped and stuffed with gut busting tension, killer suspense and brutal slayings. Thank you, Mr. Green",Halloween
1838,aanzalonejr,Excellent movie.,8,22 October 2018,"Long time movie buff here in my early 40's never felt like reviewing a movie until now, not much of a review just more of a comment, this is a great idea and a great film, erasing 30 + years of mostly lousy sequels with a few decent ones in between comes this one which I enjoyed even more then the Original although it could have used a bit more in the story department, it was good enough for fans of the Original, much faster paced, more action and even had some very lough out loud funny moments, I see why they brought in Danny McBride for this at first I was puzzled with the choice as a writer.
Jamie was excellent has the broken down older self who was never ale to move on with her life at all and spent the past 40 years obsessing over killing Michael.

The actor did NOT study Michael enough or something. His movements were all wrong. From the way he walked and moved. It was very disappointing. I'm also very upset at the fact Michael killed a child.

I rarely get excited for new Horror movies because although it's my favorite genre it is almost all misses and Halloween is no exception. I can't believe there are so many positive reviews in here and on RT. This movie was utter garbage, a complete waste of time. The script was bad, the acting wasn't any better, the injection of corny comedy was uncomfortable and the situational realness had my head in my hands. It was NOT scary in any sense of the word and to even be affiliated with the powerhouse the original was is a shame. It was nothing a great or even good horror movie should be, slasher or not. Leaving the theatre with people speaking positively about it had me ashamed to be a moviegoer, but then again I guess it doesn't take much to entertain a generation that gets excited about picture filters.

I was excited to see this but it just did absolutely nothing for me. In the original you got to know the characters, the story line made sense. These characters you just couldn't relate to whatsoever they were boring to say the very least! The comedy was weird especially during the part where you knew Michael Myers was in the closet from the trailer, the last thing before that lead up you want to see or hear is comedy. I really enjoyed Halloween 2 from 1981 if anything they should have left off from that one. They burned him in this one so obviously he could have survived that one also and picked up from there and kept the brother sister story line. Watching these movies and having so many of them made it was hard for me to erase all of the concepts over the years . I also didn't like that they showed him unmasked so many times it took away from the creepy Michael Myers factor for me. It was just to predictable, so disappointed sadly.",Halloween

The normal things you might miss in a movie, I catch.I was really excited to watch Halloween because I expected it to be better or just as good as the original. When remaking a movie or creating sequels please make them at the very least just as good as the original. To me, this movie was a big disappointment. I do not blame the actors because the acting was just fine, it was more of the scriptwriter's fault.There were a couple things that I noticed in the movie that either made me cringe or left me confused. There were a lot of unnecessary characters in the movie. We did not need the reporters in the beginning, Halloween would have ended the same way without them. As well as Allyson's boyfriend, it was absolutely pointless for him to be in the movie for 4 minutes and to be comepletely honest we all would have been fine without Allyson in the movie because all she did was give us mad anxiety. I also noticed a lot of unsolved sense.We never found out what happened with Allyson and her boyfriend, when the school evacuated did anyone get hurt, why did the doctor turn into a weirdo and why did no one care about the Allyson's dad dying? So many things that I had questions for and no answers.In this movie I also noticed that the actors were kind of dressed as if they were in the 80's BUT PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY EVERYONE HAS NEW CARS AND IPHONES?I left the theater so disappointed wanting a refund. I give this movie a 2/10 because I need to give the actors credit, they did a good job. I would also like to give credit for the killings although, there were some unnecessary killings, I thought it was all realistic.

1857,russell-owen,Had potential... but somewhat wasted,8,26 October 2018,"Personally being a teenage horror fan, and major Halloween fan, it fueled me with excitement to watch the new H40, and i was filled with positive emotion entering the cinema but left with raher mixed feelings towards the end. The reason i say this for is because i felt as if too much was given away in the trailers, and a major twist plot completely shamed the whole movie which was so unnecessary. Adding to that i feel that michael was way too of centre from how he should have been played.Personally, as i feel many halloween fans would agree, Michael is a killer who stalks his victims, letting them be engulfed in fear from his presence before being shocked by their realisation that they are the next victim, when its too late. Unfortunately Michael is no longer the stalking psychopath that we once knew and is now often seen walking around for most of the movie, however there are some glimpses of greatness within the movie where michael is seen being the killer we once known if watching the movie, such as the garden scene and in the house with the babysitters which should NOT have been given away in the trailer. I believe this movies ending scene went way over the top and was unrealistic, but now is the perfect way to add onto a follow up of the movie with a sequel. The way i believe they should approach this is through the use of michael escaping through the broken floor boards, which Laurie shot through when she was in the basement when michael first broke into the house. additionally they should now play off her granddaughter as the main character as then we, as an audience, will be able to gain the same character development to Allyson (lauries granddaughter) as what we have with laurie strode. Additionally to michaels scenes they need to incorporate the tence theme music more, to when michael is involved to increase the intensity for fans.I believe this is a new breath of fresh air for the halloween franchise as although somewhat disappointed in parts of the movie, overall i was impressed with how the movie was presented and what was made of the movie, i am happy with the movie as well as frustrated with just how great it could have been.",Halloween
1858,robinnz,How is this getting a high rating warning spoilers inside,4,26 October 2018,"Why did a waste money on this one i a huge Halloween fan and i really looking forward to this one but the movie was ok i will stick to the original and i won't be buying this one like i thought i would. some of the things disspointed in spoilers ahead one it was too long i getting bored near the end. so the backstory is that Laurie Strode wasn't Micheal sister it was just a rumor but didn't go into much details Laurie was just someone Micheal went after so if she was just a person why go after her now is it because she survived and he wanted to kill her and how did Laurie know that he would go after her again. Laurie Daughter the way they wrote her was bad not much character details same with the daughter but at least the grand daughter was more involved character. what pisses me off with most horror movie and it happened with this one is when a Female Character is running away from the Killer why are they screaming down the street they makes the Killer find them more easier i happens all the time. the other thing i didn't like was the Doctor who was treating Micheal he became obsessed with Micheal and wanted him alive. Loomis was a different story he was Obsessed with Micheal but it was a different way he knew how dangerous Micheal was and wanted him dead. The Killings were not that Orginal the only cool one was the babysitter and then the others not so great. the Ending wasn't that Great.so all in all not a good Movie, too long, boring in parts.

Though for a horror film I thought it was pretty decent, just not the hyped great movie I was hoping for. I didn't get the build up suspense I got from the original. and I didn't find it to be as scary as the first or even the original sequel. I am glad it is doing well, since I am a true fan of horror. I didn't hate it, just wish I loved it. I would actually rate it a little higher maybe a 6.5",Halloween
1861,swatso-05005,"Strong story, weak dialogue",6,27 October 2018,"This anticipation of this film brings feeling of nostalgia of childhood movie nights, but unfortunately doesn't deliver the most appealing screenplay. Especially compared to a nother remake such as IT. The film begins with cheesy lines such as ""now I've got peanut butter on my penis"", I suppose this line would be comical to your typical 8th grade at best. Also, Laurie Strode explains that she prayed michael would escape so that she could kill him, but at the price of how many people dying? The logic of that statement was inconsistent with her character. Overall the movie was fun to watch, but I reccomend waiting until the film released to DVD and streaming apps.",Halloween
1862,stephentylerjones,Bitter Sweet,7,27 October 2018,I went into the local theater with my hopes high. I pumped myself up by having a few friends over and watching the entire franchise (minus 3). I left the theater with a empty feeling. I enjoyed quite a few things about the film particularly Jamie Lee Curtis's performance. However even her amazing acting couldn't feel the void I had leaving the film. I think a lot of people will like this film but as for me I have to just settle with a bitter sweet feeling.,Halloween

An unparalleled disappointment.",Halloween
1867,reamerelise,Horror =/= Humor,3,28 October 2018,"My first qualm with this film begins very early on. The characters who open up the film are two people who are making a podcast and decide to do some research about Michael and Laurie. They open our film, they bring him back the mask, they seem overall important. However, their only /real/ importance in this story was the fact that they needed to somehow return Michael's mask to him. The podcasters die early on, beginning a string of characters who are built up to be very important and then turn out to be nearly irrelevant.
Allyson's boyfriend is another great example. Her relationship with him, her induction into honor society, and their dance all seem like they will be large plot points. The honor society is used as a reason to get Laurie to show up to a family event, only to ruin it and piss everyone off within seconds. The dance is only used to inconvenience Allyson to not have her phone. Her boyfriend cheats on her and then what? He is never seen again, despite being what seemed to be a big part of Allyson's character.
Again with most of Allyson's friends - the blonde and her boyfriend who get killed off, the chubby awkward kid who tries to be a rebound. None of her friends are relevant other than to either give Michael a kill or inconvenience a main character in stupid ways. Why didn't she just get her phone out of the pudding?
The most infuriating part of this movie other than the characters who went from relevant to irrelevant in minutes was the overuse of humor. A little bit of comedy to lighten the mood is okay, but the use of jokes in this movie were too much. As a spoof horror film, I would rate this at about 8/10. The kid that Allyson's friend babysits is purely comedic relief. One joke from him was enough; the rest was overkill. And again, he becomes irrelevant after hardly any screentime. He runs out of the house and is never seen again. Does he escape? Do his parents come home? We don't know because his only purpose in the movie was to get laughs.
If you are going to have a movie with so many irrelevant characters, you need to rethink some things. They should have more of a purpose than to exist solely as a kill for Michael. If you are going to include humor in a horror movie, don't go overboard. This movie with the combination of irrelevant characters, acting that I won't even begin to touch in, and humor seems closer to a Scary Movie type. I would not recommend this movie to a friend, and I would never watch this again. No matter how much I love horror movies and the Halloween franchise, I feel ashamed to call this one.",Halloween

1869,staceyvamprina,Too overrated only liked the mask,3,29 October 2018,The only reason they remade this movie was cause John Carpenter was not happy about the other sequels to to Halloween 1978 and he wanted to make more more money with Jamie Lee Curtis. I watch this Halloween 2018 movie it felt like story line was so different and boring I almost fell asleep to it. Yeah the pumpkin thing was alright in beginning and the soundtrack was alright. I love the Michael Myers mask but I didn't like this movie as much as the Halloween 1978. I am so upset they had to take out the brother and sister thing which sucks. I was so disappointed they had to put the new doctor in and he had a Michael Myers mask on that made no sense then ended up being killed? No one can replace Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasence) place. I wish they never remade this move stupid. I just love the mask and soundtrack that's it. Save your money don't go see it in movie. It's all about money. What's next the new Friday the 13th again?,Halloween
1870,dazzler-02295,Really disappointed,4,29 October 2018,"I really don't understand how a fan of the original could praise this film, having re-watched it last night I was very excited to see this sequel. The atmosphere from 1978 was nowhere to be seen, a complete mismatch of genres. It didn't seem to know what film it wanted to be (had the director even seen the original!?). It did have a few twists I didn't expect but I'll never have any interest in seeing this again.",Halloween
1871,kromanr,40 years later...,3,30 October 2018,"To start with, we waited 40 years for the perfect continuation of John Carpenters Halloween only to find that 2018 Halloween has taken a beautiful baby, 40 years in the making, and slaughtered it. In an unfortunate attempt to cram too much into a single film, the story line was spread far too thin to appreciate. Jamie Lee's acting was disappointing to say the least, as was the new Michael Myers. Michael lost his eerie, casual stomp about him and instead was replaced by a clumsy, ordinary, run of the mill serial killer. One thing we used to fear most about him was, no matter how fast they ran and how many twisted turns the victims took, Michael was never more than two steps behind them while seemingly, casually strolling. He used to truly be A monster. In this film, he became easy prey to everyone who fought back. Down to the fact that he actually reacted to pain in this 2018 sequel. The scene where he is finally trapped in the basement cage and set on fire feels like a scrambling attempt at destroying a monster that 40 years earlier would survive gunshot wounds, stab wounds amongst other things. The fact that a simple fire could put him out, is questionable. Finally, the closing scene of Laurie Strodes granddaughter menacingly gripping the knife a la Michael just lets onto the fact that this story that is Halloween is yet to take another painful, unnecessary turn towards another film. If anything is to be appreciated about the film is the kid being babysat by one of the victims and his whimsical eff it all, comedian like approach to situations. The musical score also was fairly good.",Halloween
1872,alex-68498,"Had original movie vibes, awesome sequel",9,30 October 2018,"Halloween was absolutely riveting! I'm a big fan of the franchise and seeing that all the other sequels were not very good, I'm happy they made this as if none of those existed. They really tied everything together and even had a bunch of references to the original. For example, when Michael killed the babysitter and put a ghost costume on her, that was an awesome reference to the original! I also loved how they kept the same music and sound effects. Very nostalgic. Michael was still the same Michael we know. Sneaky. Creepy. Stealthy. Keeps to himself. Warning: much more graphic than the original but it does the trick. One negative aspect was how Laurie Strode changed personalities every two seconds. ""Oh hey I'm in hiding and I'm never talking to anyone. I'm separated from my family and I'm the wisest woman blah blah blah"" 20 minutes later she shows up at a restaurant in public with her family and starts having a mental breakdown at the table. That's the only real flaw. Overall, a must see!",Halloween
1873,alurajenson,HORRIBLE.,1,1 November 2018,"Michael Meyers, in this version of Halloween, is humanized. The grandest mistake that can possibly be made with his character. The reason Michael Meyers is so scary is BECAUSE he seems somewhat supernatural.

1876,zuzubookgrapher,A true horror of a movie,1,5 November 2018,"I've seen many many horror movies that were bad, but this one was an epic failure.
The characters poorly developed or unnecessary. Cringing plot and no real feeling of terror.
There were couple of scenes that blew my mind for its sheer stupidity:
1) ""The woman in the bathroom."" I understand being afraid and all, but why grab a freaking crowbar if you're just going to cry and do nothing at all. At least, run outside and yell for help.
2) The Grandma making a fuss and seeming badass about how she prepared for Meyers return, only to be thrashed senseless by him. And stop with the senseless onelines ""happy halloween Michael?!""
3) Her daughter and granddaughter were equally cringe worthy. For someone that was trained rigourlessly by her mother, she was an inept and unbelievably lousy shooter. Aim at list for his torso!
4) This final point was later mentioned by my sister. It's about the poor murdered husband (already forgot his unimportant name) that remained in the closed while the house was set ablaze. And none of the ladies thought about fetching his body?!

I been traumatized by the Halloween, H20 series ever since I was a toddler and still traumatized till this very day 28 years later.

1878,egproductions,Mr. Sandman.... give me a break...,1,13 December 2018,"Moustapha Akkad and Dimension Films should have stopped after H20. What does Resurrection, H1 & H2 by Rob Zombie and this one have in common?
Yup, non of them are quite good. So why bother on doing another one?
Mr. Akkad Jr., just make a press conference, at your own house if you will, stating ""None of the Halloween movies after H20 counts, that was the final movie and ignore the rest, we won't be making another one. Thank you, come again.""
Now... my review of this film. Horrible and unexplained plot device to put Michael on a killing strike once again, Laurie Strode is annoying as hell in this one, her offsprings are annoying too, specially her loud daughter (If I hear her screaming MoOoOm once again, I swear...), death scenes are horrid and unmemorable, no suspense, no terror, no sense of dread, male characters are reduced to nothing while all females are glorified. Lighting, cinematography and sound effects are superb.... as of the rest? subpar.
Halloween, Halloween 2 and Halloween H20 are the best movies with Laurie Strode in all of them, seriously a great trilogy among all the mess the other movies are. I won't consider this story cannon, you should do the same. Don't watch this trash.",Halloween

When the movie came out i went and watched it and it was not the best. There was absolutely NO horror theme in the movie. There was not one jump scare, only comedy. Yes comedy is not a bad thing, but when you plan to see a horror movie you don't want to walk in there and expect to hear everyone in the theater laughing.

I think some people are over exaggerating with their dislike for the film. It's perfectly okay if you didn't dig it, but calling it ""atrocious"" or ""the worst one in the franchise"" seems like a bit of a reach. While I do agree that it could've been better, it's still an improvement compared to the other sequels we got in the 20+ years.

I think it delivered on the aspect of the thrills..the killings were well done..the killer did as expected and killed..
However there werent new ideas..
I was surprised though when they werent cancelling halloween even with a killer on the loose and with people turning up dead..
Just pointing out some issues I have with the movie..
Some scene as it played out was cringeworthy..gotto blame the direction for the way the scenes were acted out
Judy Greer looked out of place as the daughter..Overall I think 5 stars is a fair score..right in the middle.

We had high hopes for the film and were hoping to be spooked before the holiday arrived. But when I left the theater spooked it was for different reasons than I had hoped. The film contained an aspect of evil that I had never witnessed on screen, but also reminded me of a sobering thought for the world we live. This wickedness seen in the film has entered our world and is now being seen more frequent than ever. School shootings, mass killings, extreme racists, and other forms of pure evil are filling news headlines each month. While this movie did not exactly encourage this evil, it made the topic a sort of entertainment. Michael Myers, the main antagonist and mass murder in the flick, internalized the anger that he had felt from a child. He chose violence as an outlet of his frustrations. Hollywood created this fictional story to scare viewers and create a sense of thrill. But in all reality, the film revealed the worlds need for the gospel. There is no outlet for frustrations Michael felt other than the gospel. School shooters, mass murders, and violent racists need Christ, not counselors or therapy. The need for Christ in our broken world is becoming more evident as each day passes. The film, Halloween, reminded me of the need for Christ in our hurting world.",Halloween

1897,RhinestoneHammer,Dr Green's Greatest Hits,7,22 January 2019,"From the opening sequence's immaculately tiled top rate loony asylum where oddly British, seemingly inconsequential journo/podcaster couple attempt to catch a rare glimpse of long term resident and world reknowned psyxhotic; Dr. Erm... whoever that guy was supposed to be... In a series of monologues leading to the lament for a disinterested Myers, ""I still know so little about you Micheal,"" we too glimpse the only real consistent theme in Ha11oween. Besides Laurie's ""Trap House"" the film is a collage of rehash, almost verbatim scene caricatures from previous sequels (opposite the movie hype as an ORIGINAL spin off of 78's original material, disregarding all previous sequels). Just because most the ""homage,"" or plagiarism, plagiarizes the first film, doesn't excuse the fact that our NEW vision is a sampled ""best of"" already existing scenes from the previous installments. There is no new insight into our slasher whatsoever. Somehow he intuits after 40yrs lockup that Laurie has a granddaughter, and decides she is good as the real thing and this begins the wandering. The rest of the movie is what comes between Micheal and Laurie's granddaughter, he wouldn't have even knew existed... Completely at random amid the copycat scenes from the sequels supposed to've been disregarded, lucky for her Laurie has snapped to the detriment of all friends and family to become Sarah Connor of Terminator.Any new or inventive material is meant more or less as a device to sustain the enormously contrived Laurie as Sarah Connor, Terminator treatment. The only seemingly narrative string that lasts. The ""homage"" ploy recycles old material, the rest is empty space making blind stabs in the dark at random. Like the comedy features this writing team is familiar with, the plot is background to the punch-line, stab-line where the characters play out so so badly, so despicable, that you find yourself cheering for Micheal Myers or better yet, hoping they fall on a knife before the next scene and any sympathy with the victims is dashed and quickly swept away... Sympathy which just happens to be the motor behind what is scary in any good horror film.Micheal wore a mask in the first film so nobody would know he came home. This time he came back, mistaken for the terminator, supernaturally driven to claim a mask he no longer needed, to kill a girl he never knew existed, & become the hero of the film through discarding meaningless, no, offensive characters nobody can identify with. In the special features Jamie Lee addresses the appeal of the original film. It is the relatable middle America we all know, until the night we met the monster we had prayed we would never have had to meet. The Boogeyman. If only she had time before shooting to help explain. I read this film was intended as a learning experience for the production team, to look for a sequel and... Bullshit!!! It was a dishonest cash grab. Period. So don't get caught in the hype.
