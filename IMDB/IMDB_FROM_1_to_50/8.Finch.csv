0,SnoopyStyle,"Johnny Five, Wilson, Legend, plus stuff",6,9 November 2021,"The world has been devastated by solar radiation. The ozone layer is swiss cheese. Finch Weinberg (Tom Hanks) is roboticist survivor in St. Louis. He collects supplies during the day to avoid people during the night. He is dying. He creates a robot (Caleb Landry Jones) to care for his dog after he's gone. There is a powerful storm approaching and he has 40 days to search for safety in San Francisco.This reminds me a lot of Castaway and I am Legend. The robot is very much Johnny Five. It's a lot of bits and parts from other more original material. It will probably be forgotten soon enough in the constant flow of streaming TV. There are basic problems with this world construction. Quite frankly, Finch should be carrying a giant umbrella with tin foil covering. Even if he's avoiding direct sunlight, he should be hiding from reflected radiation. That's why the RV makes no sense. The windows should be covered. There are more than a few things that feels wrong. What's right is Tom Hanks. He is the every man no matter what the situation. Jeff is a little cute as a hapless Johnny Five. The dog is a dog. This is fine but nothing to remember.",Finch
1,bombersflyup,"Could've been something, but fine as is.",5,6 November 2021,"The core or meat and potatoes of Finch will hit close to home for most and resonates, the rest fails to deliver.The dialogue isn't great, along with liberties taken, like a robot exhibiting excitement and joy. The surrounding context's secondary and going to a bridge isn't exactly a fulfilling destination in the end, but never bad or anything.",Finch
2,ops-52535,tom hanks is the sole...,7,5 November 2021,"Survivor of this , indeed utopian apocalyptic sci-fi drama, making new friends out of what he has at hand, hes very well equiped both on material and intelectual capacities, a lot more than as a sole survivor after a plane crash in the pacific that made a film some decades ago.Its a film full of special effects, and exploding visual colours, allthough the atmosphere is dazed out by dust and dirt, the filmographers do give this film a solesurviving glow of hope. Its a film about artificial friendship, may feel slow at times, but it gives more than it takes thinks the grumpy old man. Mr finch is the sole survivor i do wanna be. A recommend.",Finch
3,Tweetienator,So So,5,6 November 2021,"Robinson Crusoe embedded in an en vogue (post)apocalyptic scenario, spiced up with a dog (how cute, dogs work always), and Number 5 (Short Circuit, 1986). The only thing I miss is E. T. ;) Finch is not a bad movie but it is one of those ueber-generic movies they produce en mass these days. Everything we get we already got served in many other movies, maybe in another context, maybe not, nothing is really new, besides maybe the blend and dose of the ingredients well known. Tom Hanks is solid, the production pro, the humor sometimes forced, and Jeff, the robot is the equivalent of mini Yoda. In a sequel Jeff maybe will get the job of WALL·E done, and clean up the mess mankind left. Verdict: all in all okay but nothing memorable. Movies like The Omega Man or I am Legend are the better ones. The movie business really needs some talented writers and not those hired copycats who depend on formulas and really have not a tiny drop of own creativity at dispose.",Finch
4,XweAponX,"What's this about ""no story""?",10,10 November 2021,"I had no trouble of following a very touching and sensitive story in this film.I have seen other movies that involved AI, well, AI for one- and Chappie, the Terminator franchise, I Robot...But this is the first time I have seen elements of ""damnation alley"" used in a basically ""robot dog sitter"" film.Because basically, that is what this is. We think that the Finch character is making a joke when he is programming Asimov's four laws of Robotics into the robot, with the fourth law focusing on the welfare of his dog ""goodyear"", rather than ""mankind"".The dog was Finch's sole focus, and he explains why to the robot ""Jeff"" about halfway through the film. What I found pleasant with this film was that the robot picked up humanizing traits from Finch as they traveled.But at the same time Weler and some unfortunate things about the man, Finch. Which explains mostly why he is doing what he is doing.It is one thing to program intelligence and knowledge into a computer. What about compassion, what about common sense? This is another thing that provides a stark difference between this film and most other ""robot"" films.""Jeff"" is being taught common sense- and that lesson is learned at too high of a cost, much too high.There is another aspect to this film: what would our world look like in the aftermath of a climate change event as severe as what happens here? Finch barely escapes a storm which is traveling at him at a rapid speed. One of the interesting things that he says about this world, is that the climate change, the solar flare, did most of the damage but we ourselves as people provided the killing blow to the human race.But there is also a glimmer of hope in this film as well.There were all kinds of stories in this film it's just that there weren't very many characters: it's just Finch, Jeff, the dog, and another dog robot, Dewey.We really don't see anybody else but you can feel their presence.There is also a little bit of Harlan Ellison's ""a dog and his boy"" here as well. Except that Jeff is less than successful in learning how to speak ""dog"".",Finch
5,kwenchow,"A bit intense at certain point, but overall full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Should have done better!",1,9 November 2021,"This film start with a man ""Finch"" walking at the desert, and he talking with his robot scene! As turnout, this film is about Finch need to survive with his robots, and dog in the world full of UV radiation! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the warning sound scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the barking scene, overuse of the coughing scene, overuse of the repairing scene, and overuse of the telling story scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, Finch died, and Jeff eventually bonding with Finch's dog! That's it! Another disappointed film!",Finch
6,andrewchristianjr,LOVED IT.,8,6 November 2021,"Loved it. It's Tom Hanks, a robot and a dog - what's not to love? From the life lessons, tender relationships portrayed between human and robot, human and dog, and the action-packed suspenseful scenes - it's a fun wild ride that had me laughing and crying and hugging my dog.",Finch
7,arungeorge13,"A man, his dog, and a robot take a road trip! [+59%]",6,10 November 2021,"Finch, the newest Tom Hanks flick, is set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with harmful UV radiation. Early on, it becomes obvious that the film will be a one-man-one-robot-one-dog show. While science only explains the plot's backdrop, the screenplay focuses more on the heart-warming, emotional connection between human, animal, and robot. We've seen bits and pieces of this in other films such as I Am Legend, Cast Away, Wall-E and more. Still, Miguel Sapochnik's 1h 55m film carries enough tenderness to see it through. By now, Tom Hanks can do these characters in his sleep, so there are no surprises there. What impresses is the CGI, world-building, and a great dog-actor (Seamus).There's a relatively unexplored character arc in terms of the titular character Finch (Hanks) not trusting people for whatever reason. He comes up with excuses to stay as far away from the post-apocalyptic survivors as possible. But, like every other human, he craves social connection, conversation, and the feeling of belonging to someone, somewhere. A few scenes of Finch and his crew deflecting from the presence of people aren't convincing enough, especially a road-chase scene. Some routine shots of eating, drinking, driving, and repairing also appear repetitively, extending the run-time. What's noticeable is that the robot can process complex human activities and information swiftly yet act very clumsy at times. Also, why the funny voice/accent? This isn't 1998. In the age when voiceover technology has advanced so much, it seems a rather odd choice.But the climactic stretch is beautifully done - both from an emotional as well as a cinematic standpoint. It makes you shed a tear when you see the gratifying connection between man and machine come to fruition, even when the plausibility of it happening in such a short span remains questionable. One can call it the perfectly wrapped cliché; pretty enjoyable nonetheless. Also, the soundtrack helps!",Finch
8,martimusross,"Good Acting, Silly Story, Tedious & No Target Audience!",5,10 November 2021,"FinchSurviving the apocalypse Tom Hanks tries to make the best out of things for him and his dog.With incredible presence and working with very little Tom develops Finch's character with micro gestures, physicality and method, it was an acting masterclass that's sucked the viewer in, we were invested from the start.The tone and jaunty music belayed the catastrophic situations that befell him, I'm not sure this really worked. However Tom's interaction with his robots was faultless and entirely believable.The subject material was adult the story was childish so this movie lacked a target audience, my guess 8 to 14 year old boys would be interested. For me the constant repetition became tiresome, although I have never been a fan of a road-trip!Overall, whilst excellently played and produced this movie lacked rationale, why did Finch want to make a robot to look after his dog, the movie suggested that there was nowhere on the planet ""safe"" for humans, however later on it became clear there was. At best this is 5 outta 10 and that goes to Tom for his brilliant acting, but seriously has this story not be done before and better!",Finch
9,leftbanker-1,Post-apocalyptic Winnie the Pooh,6,9 November 2021,"Before I have watched a single frame of this film, I can see that it's too long at 1h58 minutes. It should be a tight 90m, although it doesn't really have the legs for 90m.Why does the robot (Pooh) sound like Borat? He has an astounding array of technology at his disposal and he's using a voice software from 1998? And if Finch is such a wonder boy with science, why doesn't he make a super-hot robot, you know, to kill two birds and all?""We're on the Road to Nowhere."" Get it? Using the lyrics of a pop song to inform the audience is just about the lamest and most clichéd tool in film making.There was nothing in this film that made me want to keep watching it. Too long and too shallow. Had it been 30m shorter, it would have been more enjoyable while leaving out a lot of maudlin doggerel, no pun intended.",Finch
10,Xstal,Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep Dogs?...,1,5 November 2021,"A paradoxical, inconsistent and unoriginal dystopian tale that has a lovely dog, a kind afflicted old man and a self powering childlike robot - the perfect ingredients for contrived metaphorical tooth decay that will stay with you for at least five minutes before reality extracts it from your consciousness and the two hours you've sacrificed leaves you reaching for your dentures.",Finch
11,ketgup83,Tom Hanks carries the film like a boss !!!,7,7 November 2021,"Tom Hanks is such marvelous actor that he can get into the skin of any character and does it with so ease that convinces the audience.Finch (played by Tom Hanks) is struggling to survive both mentally as well physically in the post-apocalyptic world in the company of a dog and a robot. He knows that he is getting old and will not be able to make it through, so he invents another AI based human-like robot who imitates the activity of Finch so that they can travel as far as possible away from storms which tends to threaten them.From the director of Game Of Throne series, Finch is a heart-warming and compassionate film which will make you smile, laugh and cry with its moments. The film could have been better just like Tom Hanks's previous classic Cast Away, but looses the steam towards second half. Nevertheless, the powerful performances and few brilliant scenes and Finch can be a pleasant watch with your family.",Finch
12,thekarmicnomad,Not awful - just much too slow for me,5,8 November 2021,"This is kind of a Walle meets Castaway which in theory I should love as they are great films.I found this really boring though.The robot was not endearing to me and I found its Borat voice grating. The level of his understanding is inconsistent which made it come across as a bit of a dick. It seemed to understand really complex concepts then suddenly misunderstands something simple and causes a big mess.Tom Hanks is as Tom Hanksey as always - which is good.But I didn't really care for his character his existence in this dystopian world is as pointless as the plot of the film.The sum of this adventure is pretty much zero.As are a lot of the scenes which are draped in sunsets and shots of the open road.In that respect the world also is a little inconsistent too.It is absolutely awful and terrifying, unless you take two steps over here -then its fine.My girlfriend liked this more than me (although she did spend a lot of time playing on her phone) but I found it quite dull and pointless.All the time it was on I wished I was watching either Castaway or the Martian or something with some direction.",Finch
13,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Another one man show,6,6 November 2021,"As others have said, this is another Tom Hanks one man show like Castaway (2000). The film is funny and touching. It's just isn't amazing. Although I would love to know how they train the dog to pee on the robot's legs upon command. 🐶",Finch
14,Snootz,Great film- lousy reviews,10,5 November 2021,"When I read some of the low reviews for this film, I weep for this society. Jaded, sophomoric, wouldn't know a good film if it bit them in the butt.This is a slow-burning, slice-of-life movie. It doesn't have to have amazing CGI, nudity, foul language or gore to make it a great film. Excessively ""cutesy"" in some areas? Yes... but those are humor elements. They're meant to be a bit over the top, and throw a bit of humanity into the film.I disagree the robot carried the film. Once again, Tom Hanks pulls this through all the way; the robot and dog were ""supporting actors"". This isn't an action adventure film, it won't fill one's adrenaline addiction, and isn't for Transformer fans. It's a film about friendship, regrets, hope, and renewal. If someone doesn't get that, doesn't appreciate that... there is plenty of testosterone-filled, brainless drivel coming out of Hollywood that people can go watch instead. Those who gave this 1-star... I rate such senseless reviews 1-star because well... they're just ridiculous.This was a very good movie, full of emotion and simple humanity, presenting the good side and bad. It's not flash bang; it's more a simmer with a wonderful flavor. Great job by Hanks in what was basically a one-person show (four if you count the robots and dog).",Finch
15,pietclausen,"About a man, his dog and a robot",1,7 November 2021,"The high ratings given by viewers is for Tom Hanks, but don't be fooled by that. If you like watching a man walking, driving and mainly talking to himself, than it's for you. A total bore, achieving nothing, and nothing more.",Finch
16,kuarinofu,Exceptionally bland drama full of clichéd scenes,5,5 November 2021,"Finch doesn't feel like a sci-fi film, nor does it feel like a survival one.It's just a rather slow and bland drama with empty dialogue and an expected ending. By the end of the movie, you get a distinct feeling that the movie could have worked, but they only focused on the visuals and forgot about engaging the viewer in the story. The world looks beautiful, but it doesn't feel dead, there is no sense of hopelessness, the need to survive.Hanks' character hardly catches on. Jeff could have been interesting, but since this is not a science fiction movie, he is not written like a robot, but as a teenager. This is probably done on purpose, but it is not clear why this is not reflected in the dialogues, there is no father-son dynamic. They could have chosen one of two things, either make him a robot and have Hanks explain the world to him through human logic, or make him a full-fledged child and develop the appropriate dynamic. They threw in a little of this, a little of that, and ended up with nothing.In its current state, Finch (2021) is a visually pleasing 105 min long character introduction that surely won't retain your attention. I cannot rate it lower than 5/10 since the production and all the visual stuff were great. Can't say this for the music though.P. S. And yeah, closing a dramatic scene with rain isn't such a fresh move in 2021.",Finch
17,Neptune165,I have no desire to see it again,4,8 November 2021,"This movie is depressing. Earth is devastated, he dies and leaves his dog with the robot, and that was it. It was pretty bad, if you would remove Hanks out of the equation it would be a 4/10 IMO. Crappy, sappy and edited by an amateur.. what a mess of a movie. Plot-wise it has more holes than Swiss Cheese. It feels very clinical and yes, a lot of stolen concept. If this film is not acted by Tom Hanks, no one would see this crap. Depressing movie with an annoying robot. What an idea for a film that even beloved Tom Hanks couldn't save. The way it tries to promote A. I. as a benign thing and how it can become more and more human if ""we properly educate it"" is simply ridiculous. This is a long, boring and lame movie. The only thing that made me watch it in its entirety is the fact that Tom Hanks stars in it.Other than that, there's not much to watch.",Finch
18,Neptune165,I fell asleep watching this. Something about a bridge,4,8 November 2021,"Predictable from start to finish. Even though the movie tries to sell the whole ""knowing about it and experiencing it are two different things"" message, that doesn't work in this movie. I had expected a twist of sort, didn't believe a movie could really follow the line that bluntly, but it does. Nothing unexpected ever really happens. There are moments where I thought that's where the movie is heading but that is barely touched on and Jeff is reduced to ""the dog doesn't like me"", literally slapping you across the face with the arc of his character. So disappointed Tom hanks agreed to this junk.",Finch
19,msbreviews,I highly recommend watching this subversive take on the world's ending.,7,7 November 2021,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Finch is far from being the most impressive, imaginative post-apocalyptic, survival film, but it's still a captivating, character-driven story that boasts an emotionally resonant, meaningful personal journey.Tom Hanks proves to still be in shape by delivering a genuine performance as a man who teaches and learns about companionship, human bonding, and perseverance of love and life.Focusing on the relationships between Finch, the adorable dog, and the witty robot (excellently voiced by Caleb Landry Jones), Miguel Sapochnik takes good advantage of stunning cinematography, exceptional VFX, and one of the year's best scores to elevate an otherwise generic, somewhat slow movie.Despite some world-building elements being foreshadowed and not receiving a satisfactory outcome, I still highly recommend watching this subversive take on the world's ending.""Rating: B.",Finch
20,Alexander_Blanchett,Another One Man Show for Tom Hanks,7,5 November 2021,"It was a decent movie. The premise was not the most original one, as we have seen elements of it in previous films. I think this is a film that again suffers a little bit from its marketing and the expectations it arises. If you expect an action loaded film like ""I, Robot"" you will be disappointed. This is rather a melancholic story about a dying man and his dog who creates a robot as a caretaker. Its a film about life, loss and moving forward.It does have some action and tense elements that are typical for a SciFi adventure, and it does have fantastic visual effects and a beautiful cinematography. But the core of it is the characters (including the dog, which has its own character) by which the film is driven.Its truly another one man show on Tom Hanks' resume and he has more than once proven that he is great at that. This is no difference. Tom Hanks gives a very touching performance. Its not constantly brilliant as he sometimes sleepwalks a bit through it, but in its essence very good.I also liked he dynamic between the three characters which was nicely done.Good film, not legendary, not a 100% must see but a good way to pass 2 hours with.",Finch
21,Littleman95,"Nothing Special, Mainly Boring",4,5 November 2021,"Plot: I sincerely expected something more deep, moving. It turned out that the story is nothing really special. I'm sorry to say this, but I've found it very stretched and boring.In particular on the topic of ""what was the cause of this post-apocalyptic setting and what's next, how to survive.Actors & Pets: well, nothing to say against Tom, I'm just sad that they didn't exploit well his acting skills.Visual Effects: at the level of a 2021 work!Soundtrack: very good, it brings you through the movie very well.Conclusion: aside the lacking and boring plot, everything else was very good. So it's up to you: would you like to enjoy a long and not so eventful journey? You can give it a try. Do you like movies with a well developed sci-fi plot? Search it somewhere else (sadly). Or do something that will keep you awake while watching this movie :)",Finch
22,lareval,"Funny, tender and emotional",8,7 November 2021,"A pleasent surprise I had with this movie. One that triggers the emotions really good and owns a good pacing from start to finish. Tom Hanks proves once again he is a legend by giving his all once again. It's a movie that hooked me from the beginning, that blends intimate moments (Finch and Jeff), with tension and funny bits. One of my favourite moments is when he is telling the story of a mother and her daughter (no spoilers, only Hanks could make it work that gripping). The ending is both emotional and sweet, I couldn't help but cry. A movie that should be seen.",Finch
23,Draysan-Jennings,If Cast Away & Chappie had a baby,6,6 November 2021,"Not the most exciting movie but it flowed well and kept my attention. I just thought the story needed more human interaction. Other then the car chase scene all we had was two robots, the dog and the main character. Would of been nice if we actually got to see the people hiding in the shadows. It would of made the movie a little more suspenseful. Either way it's still a solid one man show. 6 stars.",Finch
24,Dragonborn64,Wilson is a Robot in this one,4,8 November 2021,I found myself getting bored quite quickly with this cliched ( why is it always a can of peaches?) schmaltzy tale.

Is it the Best or Most original movie I've seen? NO! There have been tons of End the World scenario movies for decades. But overall I found it entertaining and well done. He was doing more than most people finding themselves alone in an apocalypse with deadly radiation that has basically made the planet a bit more HELLish, than it's felt the Last Few Years. Had good special effects, and tugged at the heart strings and again, I just luv Tom Hanks, Animals and cute robots.If your looking for some marvel universe, action packed voyage, or The Walking Dead, where the characters are always fighting, killing, running, A Blood Fest Galore, then this movie isn't for YOU! If you want something that makes you ponder our future predicament on this dying Rock we call earth, and a thoughtful and Smart main character then you may enjoy this as much as I did.",Finch

27,daisukereds,"""Bad news on the doorstep""",7,7 November 2021,"While a very simple and objective-less story, it is not all bad. It's one of those plots where the journey is more important than the destination.Ponders a lot on topics such as to what we do with the time we are given, the legacy of a dying man and the things that were important to him (in this case : a dog), and others. But by no means deep in any department. The setting and context of a dying world is very present (but not enough), but is not the focus. Whoever wrote the story wanted to talk about dogs, and dying.Sadly, much like with the world these characters inhabit, there's not much else to look forward to. The robot is the main focus of the movie, and by all means, it is very well written (although 100% unbelievable by today's standards). With plenty of wonderment for a ""newborn"" and lots of human-like personality. But it's nothing we haven't seen before.I would like to see this expanded into a story worth remembering, though. Otherwise, it was just a fun and well-acted watch, that might leave you thinking about things and stuff for a few minutes. Maybe, make you feel like you need to pet a dog.",Finch

30,efd-10467,Pretty but flat,5,5 November 2021,"The Tom Hanks man against the world character has been a bit overdone, a bit marooned, a bit Captain Phillips, a bit Gump, this is worth watching simply from the technical quality but fails to engage the viewer at an emotional level. Robots or non human characters are either bland or childish so this film was always going to battle connecting, it's all down to special effects and Tom Hanks, it delivers but not in a particularly satisfying way.",Finch
31,pranayjalvi,All about Man and his love for his friend,7,7 November 2021,"Finch isn't the most original or exciting sci-fi movie you'll ever see, but it's a charming road trip adventure anchored by yet another incredible performance from Tom Hanks.The setup is remarkably simple given what we've come to expect from sci-fi stories revolving around the end of the world; a man surviving along with his dog and a robot created by him.Movies that focus almost entirely on just a handful of characters are almost obligated to feature strong performances to keep the attention of the viewer, and that's very much the case with Finch given that the only other three figures seen onscreen in the entire 115-minute running time other than Finch himself are two robots and a dog.Finch is a decent film, with no complexity, but with few emotions and moments that will please you (as well as the VFX) for straight 115 minutes.",Finch

34,grlym-46849,Touching movie,7,6 November 2021,The movie was much better than what I thought at first (in the opening of the movie)I wonder if Tom Hanks desires isolation as this kind of felt like his movie Castaway...although this movie was so much better.,Finch
35,nidhunmoviebuff,"An emotional, cathartic post-apocalyptic drama",7,9 November 2021,"You would think Tom Hanks as the lone survivor/warrior against the environment trope has been done to death after classics such as Castaway (2000) and Terminal (2004). But it is testament to the greatness of the actor that he still finds ways to display new shades and levels to his characters within similar plotlines and catch you surprise with the feelings he can generate within us, the viewers.Finch is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller that follows the journey of a former robotics engineer who is fighting for survival in a world devastated with ionic radiation after a cataclysmic solar fare. With no humans for company, the titular 'Finch' finds solace in his faithful pet dog, Goodyear.When the going gets even tougher with food and shelter growing harder to find, Finch embarks on building and training an advanced humanoid robot only to face many hardships and obstacles in his journey for survival. Being a one-man film is never a shortcoming with a performer of Hanks' caliber, with the two-time Oscar winner excelling in his combination scenes with the dog as well as the newly minted robot.The human-robot interactions generate a lot of natural, spontaneous humor as they both struggle to understand each other. But things take a drastic turn in the second half as situations get more dire, subjects such as existentialism and the legacy one leaves behind after death come up and are dealt with deftly by director Miguel Sapochnik.One of the finest directors to work on the iconic 'Game of Thrones' franchise, Sapochik paints a canvas bereft of CGI or gimmicks to tell us a melancholy yet irresistible story of battling against insurmountable odds, survival and ultimately, sacrifice and selfless love.Caleb Jandry Jones is a revelation as the voice of the robot 'Jeff', imbuing a sense of wonder and inquisitiveness at the beginning and that of enlightenment and fulfilment towards the climax. From what appears initially to be a supporting role Jeff emerges to be on par with Finch in terms of the connect he manages to make with the audience.Finch won't be everyone's cup of tea. Ultimately, it is not your formulaic apocalyptic thriller but a more earnest exploration of emotions and companionship. For me, it was a cathartic, life-affirming experience that reinforced my beliefs that it is the little things that make you happy and bring a smile to your face that truly matter and makes our life worth living.Companionship and brotherhood can be found in the strangest of places. Recommended!",Finch

One of the issues was the Wall-E type behavior of the robot. Another is the behavior of Finch. The man has spent how many years surviving on his own in a dangerous and deadly wasteland and he behaves like a fresh faced recruit in his first battle. It does not make sense that he would not have built up some resolve and fortitude during his travels. There is nothing wrong with caution but he was in absolute panic mode and that is not how a person survives. I also find it hard to believe that Finch would not have tried radio etc to contact others or at least see what was happening elsewhere in the world. Then we have the ending. Disappointing.,Finch

42,Spartan_1_1_7,"Tom Hanks, A Doggo, and a Couple of Robots on a Journey in a Post Apocalyptic World. Fresh and Enthralling.",8,8 November 2021,"Finch (2021) is an Apple TV+ film starring Tom Hanks as the titular character, a couple of robots, and a dog. Set on a post-apocalyptic Earth, it is about Finch and his companions trying to survive while they set on a journey for a better location. I legitimately decided to watch it just because I saw a solo Tom Hanks with a Robot and a dog on the poster, thinking at worst it will be a middling watch. It turned out to be a heartwarming and somewhat original experience and I'm glad I made that jump.Tom Hanks, to no surprise, delivers a poignant performance as an old survivor in a desolate landscape desperate to find some way of safeguarding his only biological companion, particularly in his absence, a doggo named Goodyear played wonderfully by Seamus. He is also accompanied by a four-wheeled helping hand robot Dewey, and the best part of the film, Jeff, the humanoid bot with true artificial intelligence voice nicely by Caleb Landry Jones. Together, you set out on a journey with them that'll give make you laugh and give you the FEELS!Apart from the group, the thing I loved about this movie is that it sets itself apart from other films by focusing solely on the group and does not dive into what you'd normally expect from a post-apocalyptic setting. The meat of the experience is from small subtle things instead of having big thrilling set pieces or the typical Human conflicts. Seeing Jeff learning what it means to be Human from Finch and Goodyear in his newfound conscience had me smiling most of the film. I do wish the movie delve deeper into those Human elements and themes but I'm still satisfied with what I got.Directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who directed some of my favourite episodes from Game of Thrones, the movie is competently made. It can be a looker at times. Written by a duo of newbies when it comes to feature-length films, Craig Luck and Ivor Powell, I admired their venture into doing something different with a setting that could have been by the numbers story. Also, while understated, the musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla added a layer of poignancy to the entire experience, especially in key scenes.Now, it is almost 2 hours long, you hardly get any detours and instead just simmer in the experience, so the entire thing is slow-paced, which I can understand can be a turn off for a lot of people but for me, it just worked. I was enthralled by it and was enjoying the characters and their journey. So if you get bored by slow-paced stuff easily, I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, I'd suggest giving it a try, the movie might surprise you. You leave it feeling content. A slice of life experience in a post-apocalyptic world. Something original or different, at least for me. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a solid 8/10.",Finch

After a while, I was rooting for its battery to die, or for it to have a catastrophic short-circuit in its memory banks.But, alas, the robot keeps on ticking. So we are offered a meandering sequence of ramblings, irrelevant musings and whatnot by Finch and his mechanical friend. In no time at all, after Finch meets his electronic friend, the movie become too tedious and pretty much an uninteresting affair, with Finch and the robot driving on a wasteland (the type of which we have seen in countless other dystopian films), until its abysmall ending.So instead of ""Cast Away"" remake we have a ""Wasted Away"" opportunity.It is not worth your time.",Finch

At times the movie is funny and fond of non-human characters, it also tells a compelling and emotional story. The special effects are good, as is the CGI, the locations where it was filmed and the few performances are good.The film entertains and develops well the situation in which the protagonist finds himself, but the main character lacks a little more development, just as his attitude and the way of being of him can be annoying at a certain point.",Finch

Apple cannot make a film or video that is not deeply tainted by Apple. This film is so predictable, artificial and empty of real moments, I found it unwatchable. Two: Hanks needs to give it a rest.

Want proof? Skeet Ulrich and another actress were originally cast for Finch, in addition to Hanks, yet they are no where to be found in the final product.That's a shame, because I think this was a pretty good film as it stands, it just could have been so much more.There were a few times my mind began to wander while I watched it, and I found myself ""clock watching"", so I know there were more opportunities to give this film more life.Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor. One of the very few who can pull off a film like this, but there were missed opportunities to flesh out the story more, and I'm assuming the ""missing"" actors were in flashbacks that were never filmed in the end.All in all, emotional, interesting, and somewhat boring, at times.P. S. Hollywood rant, use ""real"" dogs!!

The robot was a little too humanly stupid, at various parts of the film, which was daft considering it/he had just been activated and, had no character formulated at all.You sense very quickly that the end is not going to be a happy one but, the friendship that was developing was very believable (it made me sad because I know that the majority of humans would never try to bond with a robot/android etc when, they are eventually integrated into society...if humanity lives that long!). There is a superb segment that is so strong in showing how close they were that, I'm sure there will be a few tears shed.Its a lovely looking film, well acted, full of little reminders of other films you'll have seen of solo characters i.e. WALL-E, I am Legend, No.5 from Short Circuit and even the classic Bruce Dern film, 'Silent Running'!",Finch

How unfortunate because the concept is great, albeit not original; Tom Hanks's masterclass acting is again on display; and the way the movie successfully humanizes a robot with just two dots on the face, without even a nose or a mouth, is very impressive. It all boils down to the clever use of body language and the vocal intonations of the robot. You really get to develop an affinity to this mere heap of metal.

58,BijeshNagesh,A Simple Perfectly Balanced Tale,8,7 November 2021,"When a movie with Tom Hanks comes along, you'd best believe I'll watch every second of it. Miguel Sapochnik's directorial excellence with ""Finch"" for Apple TV+ put Hanks in the shoes of the titular character, and in a story that was surprisingly stunning despite being so simple.As post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi goes, several of them contain wondrous grandeur but only a handful succeed in capturing a core emotional angle through its characters. ""Finch"" succeeded in doing that through not just Hanks but also a dog named Goodyear (real name Seamus, probably an Irish Terrier mix breed).Finch was a robotics engineer who learned that he did not have long to live after accidentally being exposed to ionizing radiation. The world has ended - something to do with gamma rays and the Sun. The man's experiences with a mother-daughter in the supermarket during those dark days when the world was about to start dying in earnest... Those scenes were quite heart-wrenching and meaningful.The love that Finch had for his dog made him create a robot named Jeff (voiced by Caleb Landry Jones) that would take care of his pet companion when he no longer could. Jeff brought his own distinct touch to the plot, one that was thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming to watch.Craig Luck and Ivor Powell wrote quite the adventure in ""Finch"", which was blessed with Jo Willems's larger-than-life cinematography and Gustavo Santaolalla's from-the-heart musical score. Soundtracks like Don McLean's ""American Pie"", Perry Como's ""Papa Loves Mambo"", Benny Goodman's ""Sing, Sing, Sing"", and Talking Heads' ""Road To Nowhere"" were all wonderful.Costume design was neat, kudos to the brilliant Kurt and Bart. Between production design and art decoration, I couldn't quite tell who did the better job of making this movie feel so incredibly real. Hair and makeup did good work too, and so did the stunt, sound, and editing departments. The VFX and special effects crews deserve high praise. Much the same can be said for what animal trainer Raymond W. Beal brought to the project.Though far from anything you'd consider original, ""Finch"" had memorable entertainment value and is guaranteed to tug on all the right heart strings. It's how they told the story more than what story they told. Besides, it's a Tom Hanks movie.",Finch

And if you buy this premise, you will buy anything that Apple dare sell you.The production value is great. No question there.The plot is easy to summarize: Live-action WALL-E with Cowboy Woody.Finch lives in a world where you can create your own machines with compatible parts form different machines, a world where Apple does not exist fortunately.

His films are still quite watcheable and the producer is Robert Zemeckis.Overall I think the film could've improved greatly from better editing. Some parts were too slow, too much talking, and it drags. Running at almost 2 hours, it could benefit from a shorter 1 and a half hour run time. Also, the pivotal scenes such as the storms and the danger scene could've been done better with a lot more action. Finch's storytelling scenes should all be done with visuals rather than listening to him talk, only one story was shown visually.

Other like Joe vs. The Volcano rank on a stinker scale as ""REALLY stink!""This movie had a LOT of promise, though it was an Apple TV+ movie, so it would never see the big screen.

The synopsis is: ""On a post-apocalyptic earth, a robot, built to protect the life of his creator's beloved dog, learns about life, love, friendship and what it means to be human."" You read that and think ""wow.. this might really have great potential"".. and it MIGHT have had the story been good. But it really wasn't.I watched it with my wife, and we both said how disappointed we were with this movie. Too bad. Well.. at least we know that with Tom Hanks one of his upcoming movies is going to make up for this one.The story wasn't developed well.. and we really never got to really CARE about Hanks' character. Can say the little robot garnered more affection than any other character (or the dog). As good as Tom Hanks IS, he just couldn't carry a weak story.On a 1-10 scale (10 is best), I'd give it a 5.5.

Anyway, another copycat film in a world of mostly copycat films.

Not to mention that the Earth's magnetic field would probably recover after a CME, just as it did after the Carrington Event in the 1860s (teaching moment for your kiddies).Hanks is better here than in that dumb Saudi film I don't remember the name of, but that plot and script are snoozy, though he's not as effective here as he is in Greyhound.

The message of trust and companionship is very powerful, inspiring and incredibly moving.The emotions I felt throughout this movie were simply unbelievable.I think I'm biased, Tom Hanks' performance was flawless, as are ALL of his films.This is one of those rare films which can be rewatched and rewatched countless times and continues be just as rewarding as the last time watched.There were moments I felt like crying and I did just that. The fact that Finch loved his dog so much that he made a robot to care for him after passed away, was enough to make a grown man cry.I'm far from good at writing reviews but I can say is you wont be disappointed !!I'll bold enough to say if Hanks doesn't get the Oscar for his his masterful performance then there's something seriously wrong with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science.My only regret is that I'm unable to give this movie more than 10/10.",Finch

It makes no sense, doesn't follow its own rules (the 40 day storm which lasts 4 seconds, the sun so hot it blisters skin in seconds yet out behind a windscreen Tom is not even sweating and many more preposterous inconsistencies.

82,Behnam-A,Shallow,3,7 November 2021,"I didn't like it, Neither I hated it. It can't be considered as a story of apocalyptic survival. There is no details in that matter. Also, it can't be about humanity, relationship between humans and nature and moral lessons for the same reason. As for the sci-fi aspects, it only shows the humans had been advance enough to create learning adaptive robots easily.So, what is it about? Nothing deeply but everything shallowly. The movie is also relatively slow in which It may be amusing in overall but it may bore you as well. I have to admit that Tom Hanks' performance is excellent but even that is not enough to cover the lack of a good story.",Finch

If anyone has watched Borat then it will either ruin this film for you or turn this post apocalyptic tearjerker into a comedy.For some reason they've given Jeff the Robot a similar accent and clunky mannerisms which turns this into something it isn't.Not that it's much to begin with. Tom Hanks can act superbly amongst others or with just a volleyball but this film is as empty as the derelict landscape it is set and offers nothing in its 2hr run time. The more interesting aspects of the movie are rushed through for some really drawn out and pointless scenes; all played out within a questionable plot which plays fast and loose with the dangers of this new world they've created.This review started out as being 3*s but on writing and thinking it's now a 2*!,Finch

I don't think today's audience of a certain age can enjoy a film like this without been critical about anything. If it was made in the 70s, 80s or 90s it would of been a box office hit, or cult classic. I find some films that actors of a certain era doing now are better then some of their work when they was huge stars. It's a film about a man, his dog and his robots....

I wonder why they couldn't fully develop that good idea?With all that knowledge it gained, the robot could've been able to save Finch, or at least to try to. No?At the moment when it entered the hospital I thought that'd be the plot twist. But the twist went into destroying the ""silent"" robot, which I honestly - did not understood what happened and why.The story is moving like it's going to reveal something BIG, but it fades away fast and keeps going boring and slow, until the next moment you'd think it's going to reveal something, but it fails again to...So, this movie was called ""Finch"", but it's about a robot named ""Jeff"" who was created to protect and care care about a dog named ""Goodyear""?Why it wasn't named ""Jeff"" or ""Goodyear"", instead of ""Finch""? Could've be a better title, no?And there was a few things that are very nonlogical:#1. Temperature is 40-60C - but there was no fires anywhere.#2. The asphalt wasn't melting, but their bus tires also didn't melt or got destroyed by the extremely heated asphalt.#3. Finch wasn't sweating at all, and never drank water.#4. The dog also didn't drank any water and never had it's tongue out, to cool off. The writers probably never had a dog and know jack **** about dogs....#5. Despite the food shortage - the dog wasn't eating its food fast, but was eating slowly, like it did ate 5 minutes ago, of the same, double portion.#6. Radiation is danger when one stays under the sun rays, but not danger behind the windshield and side windows of the bus.#7. Enters a random abandoned building and everything inside is well preserved and clear - including the food they find - it's still good to be eaten, despite the extreme radiation and heat.#8. It wasn't clear what energy source the robot was using.#9. The robot knows who Napoleon and Shakespeare are, but didn't know how to drive a car and needed a lessons.That's enough flaws?Please don't tell me that ""This a fantasy maaan, everything is possible in fantasy!"". No, it's not a fantasy, it's listed as a Sci-Fi movie.Below mediocre production. I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends.My rating: 3/10.",Finch

92,bobetjo,Very Wall-E and The Martian. I liked it.,9,6 November 2021,For me this movie had a lot of fun similarities with the first part of Wall-E. Tom Hanks is on his own in New Orleans. There's no one else around. The dust storms and having to lock down and take shelter. It plays to the part of us who would be quite happy if the rest of the human race perished.There is also the element of the engineer surviving by his knowledge that Andy Weir wrote into The Martian. Survival as a puzzle. Hanks does his usual excellent performance as a slightly misanthrope systems engineer who builds a robot to look after his dog if he does not survive.Jones' performance as the robot is pretty impressive. His voice changes from Stephen Hawking to more human through the film. Also full marks to the CGI technicians who resisted going over the top and kept the mechanical look and feel as the robot learned.All round a great film.,Finch
93,Westeire,Cast away II.,2,9 November 2021,"Finch seems like the sequel to Cast Away. Just a whole lot more depressing. If you are wondering if its worth signing up to Apple + to watch the movie, well I can say you can safely save your money and time. This semi woke American movie does not have many redeeming factors. An hour into the movie I was wondering when was the plot going to take off.. This dystopian sequel to Cast away is a dull monologue.

The other reviews are downright bad. 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 stars.I have been duped before by fake high ratings. So I tread with care. Watching the first 10 minutes of the movie, it does seem like a pretty good movie.From the ""birth"" of Jeff, the AI robot, every scene is fun, comedic and entertaining! I have no idea why some people hated this movie. Perhaps because it is produced by Apple (there are many Apple haters out there).It is also NOTHING like Cast Away. Though I can see why some people make that relation - just Tom Hanks alone, with some apparatus. But I promise this movie is awesome to watch, even more entertaining than Cast Away.What's interesting is the character development of Jeff. And the interaction between Finch and Jeff. It is something familiar, if you have children.All in all, Finch is an awesome movie, suitable to watch with your kids (apart from a moment of Hank's nudity, but in non sexual way).Highly recommended.",Finch

99,SeriousMayhem,"Decent and risk-free, inoffensive drama that doesn't quite achieve its goal",7,5 November 2021,"When I saw the trailer I said to myself: the trailer is probably going to be better than the movie. As it turns out, this is true, but ultimately I was not too disappointed by the overall experience.For a movie that is meant to touch the viewer on an emotional level, I feel it fell a bit short of the mark. It also doesn't seem to really try, as it stays mostly on the surface, prefering risk free, somewhat cheap and shallow sentimental moments over digging deeper into the emotions and feelings of this man called Finch. It does try once, and it does it well. Why leave it at that?If it weren't for Tom Hanks, I'm not sure the score would be as high. Hanks carries the movie; he really shines in solo roles like these.As an overall experience I wouldn't say it's boring, but at times it did feel rather bland, with a good number of missed opportunities.The CGI is very well done and production values are good.All that said, the movie does have its moment and it's definitely not bad. It just could have been a whole lot better and it's likely not something you'll remember 5 years from now.6,5/10, rounding up to a 7.",Finch
100,jwcstorage,Dont let the intro fool you,3,8 November 2021,"I decided to give this flick a go, liking the idea of it all.It opens up with a good scene that makes you feel like you are going to have a quality movie ahead of you.Unfortunately, the opening scene is about all that happens, as this is essentially a walking dead man and his dog. Very quickly its obvious where the story is going to go, but it is disappointing in how straight of an arrow it would fly in that direction.Aside from temperature and solar radiation spikes, theres not a whole lot in this movie.If you have watched any movie where there is a child-like (mentally at least) robot, you already know whats going to happen. YEP! Tom Hanks has to teach it about 'growing up' and 'responsibilities'.It meanders from story point to story point, with little to explain the ""how"" of a lot of important points. For instance, water is the most important substance for humans to live, yet once he leaves behind a robotics(???) lab that is shown to have some kind of water filtration system, water is never a problem again in this VERY dry world.Then there is the problems with Hanks' character, who allows for serious and nasty radiation burn on his hand as opposed to saying ""Robot, living things die in direct sunlight"". He does a bunch of small but irritatingly inconsistent things, which contradict his seemingly genius intellect.You know Hanks is never making it to California, which is picked because there are ""no people""(???) while the east coast is ignored because I guess there ARE people there? And of course, they run into unseen ""people"" that are the only real threat in this movie.If you want a melodrama with an annoyingly dumb robot (the way it talks, the way it ""thinks"", everything about it really) then you can probably turn off the higher thinking in your brain and just enjoy another Hanks vehicle, as Hanks does his normal everyday man as he has in almost all his recent roles. He's fine.The movie is also ""fine"" but what takes 2 hours here is typically taken care of in a montage in any normal movie.",Finch
101,Aria_Athena,Grew on me,7,6 November 2021,"I wasn't very warm in the beginning, but it really grew on me. Without spoiling too much, it is about a highly intelligent man who builds a robot with a very advance AI, capable of even ""dreaming"", for no reason other than taking care of his dog after his death. But at the same time the dog in the movie is symbolic for what mankind left behind after it finished itself off. So in the end we have a reclusive and antisocial man securing with his last breath the future of mankind's ""survivor"".",Finch
102,yooniverse,"A little dull, but likable",6,7 November 2021,"Nothing particularly clever or moving about the story. It's a slow-moving drama that's trying hard to convey a sense of hope, despair, and the human condition, in a not too distant apocalytic future, much like Midnight Sky. Finch feels very familiar--perhaps parts from Cast Away, News of the World, and Saving Private Ryan? The subject matter is a bit of a scifi trope--a robot that is learning and wanting to be human--i.e., Pinocchio, and a human who has forgotten his sense of humanity through isolation. It makes for a predictable movie that lacks originality. But much like other actors we've grown up with over decades (e.g., Harrison Ford, Clooney, etc.), we can't help but wanting to like Hanks in everything he does, no matter what it is. So, this is just another one of those movies, and you'll probably like it, though you don't know why.",Finch

enough and all systems go for an adventure.That is what should have happened.Then we get a new character. A robot. A robot that sounds weirdly like Borat, an Eastern European character rather than a robot.Roughly about 1hour 20 minutes in the director must have decided the accent was odd and change it completely for a non robot style voice. This voice is now done in the style of a late teenager.As there are only two voices in the film it is glaringly obvious there are 2nd character voice problems. It is a shame as put on any robot voice and the film would be good.

All other aspects in the story were covered reasonably, but not amplified to avoid causing a distraction/diversion from the main theme.Some have mentioned in the reviews that this film was slow, boring or predictable... Well, for me, it certainly wasn't... I believe that such a story is meant to go at a relatively relaxed pace to generate the emotional effect intended.All in all, I loved everything about this movie...

106,Jim_Screechy,Underdeveloped and somewhat annoying,6,9 November 2021,"There are a lot of good things going for this movie, but some of the problems with it are difficult to ignore and ultimately cause issues with the screenplay.Tecnical details on the atmospheric and solar issues should have been better advised but the core problems are with Finch's character and speciality. He's created a sentient being, and though he's uploaded vast amounts of information to its personal database, the education it receives from him amouts to a handful of anectdotes and half an hour of arbitrary instruction on nothing meaninngfull. Seriously! I can only imagine the horde of AI specialists squirming in their seats watching this plot unfold. This man is a coder and roboticist? About as likely as me being a brain Surgeon.Additionally, Finch's mental disposition and character traits are unteathered and unsubstatiated. He simply adopts the behavioural characteristics required for each scene with no refernce to the personality defined for the characters. It's problematic because it's difficult to establish a connection with the character as things progres and shifts the focus of the movies entertainment to a rhealm of discomfort and unease.Of course Hanks' performance is spectacular, and as is that of the Robot Jeff, voiced by Celeb Jones, but there needs to be more to this film to really make it work as there isnt' really enough 'essence' to carry the movie off. Its really just a walkabout film with a robot.The direction is good, special effects spectular, and cinematography impressive, but it's a bit like one of those video games where the graphics are everything but actual playbility has been overlooked and the result is a barren underwhelming experience that you play for a few hours then give up on.It's worth watching but not as good as I thought and hoped it would be. Its just not ready yet, and needs another half hour in the oven to ensure its well done.6/10.",Finch

Hanks explores the boundary between intelligent artificial life and a sentient ""being"", a big leap in technology that might just happen one day where the student exceeds the teacher.

111,jamuckley,What Would You Do for Those You Leave Behind,8,7 November 2021,"""Finch"" is a post-apocalyptic, sci-fi about doing everything you can to take care of those you love.The film stars Tom Hanks as Finch, who builds an AI-learning robot (Caleb Landry Jones) to take care of Goodyear (Seamus), his dog, after he is gone.The film is directed by Miguel Sapochnik (Game of Thrones) and is written by Craig Luck and Ivor Powell. The film features some epic ""wasteland"" shots of a dying world, including some realistic views of what the city of Denver would look like if it were the end of the world as we know it. The strength of the film, however, were Finch's moments with his robot, Jeff, as he teaches him to care for his dog, Goodyear.The earth has been ravaged by a solar flare that has rained down cosmic radiation on the ozone layer punching holes in it and causing surface temperatures to rise to around 140 °F, mere exposure to the sun now leaves painful first-degree sunburns. Finch is slowing dying of the radiation poisoning from the sun, but he animates a robot with AI-learning capabilities to take care of his dog upon his impending death.As Finch teaches his robot how to take care of his dog, how to stay ""alive,"" and the new rules to live by, I couldn't help but see the parallels of parenting, raising kids, and how you want to pass on your beliefs, your values, and what you found most important in this life to your loved ones that remain behind. From learning to walk to playing fetch with Goodyear, it is interesting to see how learning these basic skills are absorbed by a robot, but it also demands an introspective look on one's own values in life.It begs the question, ""Why?""Throughout the film it is actually the relationship between Goodyear and Jeff the robot, that is evolving and growing. The dog at first is completely afraid and wary of the robot. It is constantly growling and barking at it. At one point Jeff convinces himself that he taught himself ""dog language"" and imitates dog sounds he has heard (or learned), but that only leads to the conclusion that Goodyear hates him. Jeff has to learn of both Finch and Goodyear's limitations with the hazardous environment they live in. He has to learn what they need and how to help them.The most important and difficult concept that Jeff has to learn is trust. Goodyear needs to trust Jeff if he wants to be able to protect the dog. Trust is not something easily explained, but rather it is a concept one knows by experience.Ultimately, Tom Hanks puts in a typical stellar performance. There are some humorous moments. There are also some touching moments to reflect on the ""human experience."" In the bigger picture, the film asks the question, ""What is it we are passing on, and how will we do that.""",Finch

We are invited in at a point where everything suddenly changes for him. And his dog. Goodyear. Knowing his time is short, he builds a robot, Jeff, that will take care of his dog. That is Jeff's prime directive. When atmospheric conditions force them, they leave home, and head towards the Golden Gate Bridge. Jeff has a lot to learn on the way. As we all do. I loved the dialogue in this. The conversations between Finch and Jeff. A great deal is spoken about trust. And responsibility. The destination is the same for everyone, but what we do on the way and what we take from the journey varies from person to person.

123,transientdreams,"Not Great, But Not At All Bad. Certainly Worth a Watch...",6,6 November 2021,"Everything about this film is almost under-done in ways. The suspense was certainly ok, what little there was. But I can see why there were no other actors in it. Then it would have had to become a television series. Lots of unexplored potential here, so it makes sense why the disparity of opinions regarding the film. The ONLY problem that I had with it was that ""Jeff"" the robot sounded exactly like the insufferable character 'Borat' (by Sacha Baron Cohen). Truly irritating and definitely NOT a happy coincidence. I say that because obviously someone involved in the filmed had the voiced changed completely at the one-hour mark. My deepest gratitude to whomever made that decision! It's a brainless little adventure that is a nice escape from the now constant insanity that surrounds us daily, and globally. It's not worth a second thought...just enjoy it.",Finch
124,pbstarman,Heartwarming,7,8 November 2021,"At first, I thought I wouldn't like this movie, but I kept watching it anyway. As the movie progressed,I began to enjoy the film and liked it overall. I am a dog lover, so this movie plucked at my heart strings.The acting was good, not great. The cinematography and cgi/special effects were phenomenal. There was one thing that did not make sense.....supposedly Hanks or his dog would be burned by the direct sun....why weren't they burnt by the sun's rays coming through the windows of the van?I wished there were a better ending to the movie. Still. I give this movie 7 stars for being different than the usual HOLLYWOOD SCHAGER and was a dog lovers movie!!! Perhaps there will be a FINCH 2??",Finch
125,nincubura,Good Production & Acting Can't Save Horrible Writing,3,9 November 2021,"Perhaps this was intended to be a comedy, analogous to Laurel & Hardy, and I just didn't appreciate the humor? Ultimately, this is a rip-off of SILENT RUNNING (1972) with a landmark performance by Bruce Dern. One of the characters even shares the same name, which cannot be a coincidence, and is a clear homage. For a better version of the essential plot, younger people should watch SILENT RUNNING.Very competent directing, cinematography, sound, editing. And as usual, an excellent performance by Tom Hanks. Unfortunately, it is obvious that Mr. Hanks did not read the script before signing on to the project. He has kids, and knows exactly what they need hear, and would have found this script full of deep and wide chasms.Thinly credited writers Luck (primary) and Powell seem unable to recognize intelligent writing, artificially or otherwise; and, the script manifests a hideous illiteracy in science, technology, and engineering. I question whether even an 8 year old would find any fundamental premise of the technology to be plausible. E.g. The batteries for electric machines keep getting recharged, even when there is no source of electricity.When Sci-Fi has no Sci, then its credibility is lost. It's worse than a comic book shoot-em-up, where you expect one gun to shoot 25 rounds without reload (Kate, 2021).",Finch

It's a simple story with some really nicely played dramatic moments and a little bit of humour. I really liked how understated the more serious moments were. The subtlety of these parts of the story were contrasted well against the not so subtle setting.The special effects were pretty nice too. I thought it all looked great and I never felt like I was watching a movie with a lot of CGI even though it was definitely full of it.Post apocalyptic stories can be a bit too bleak for me sometimes, but I feel this one has just the right amount of bleakness and just the right amount of hope.And of course, being a dog person it was lovely to see a real dog playing a main part in a movie and giving such a wonderful performance.",Finch

I think that he typically finds quality movies to act in so have high expectations for them. (I do miss his comedy from the 'old days' like Big and Splash and Bosom Buddies.). This movie did have some good funny bits that made me laugh and I had to rewind like when Jeff made sure to copy Finch and when he first asked if he should drive. Tom Hanks as Finch wasn't always so wasn't so likable this time. He could be downright ornery. I get it though. It's probably a realistic portrayal of someone stressed about living in the apocalypse, worrying about providing for his loved ones, and being in pain. However, I just didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. It did draw out my emotions (teared up some), but also left me feeling bleak about life and society.",Finch

When you look out over the rivers, the hills, and the far horizon with a profound sense of your own littleness in the vast scheme of things, and yet have faith, hope, and courage - which is the root of every virtue. When you know that down in your heart every person is as noble, as vile, as divine, as diabolic, and as lonely as their own self, and seeks to know, to forgive, and to love your fellow humans.When you know how to sympathize with people in their sorrows, yea, even in their sins - knowing that each person fights a hard fight against many odds. When you have learned how to make friends and to keep them, and above all how to keep friends with yourself. When you love flowers, can hunt the birds without a gun, and feel the thrill of an old forgotten joy, when you hear the laugh of a little child.When you can be happy and high-minded amid the meaner drudgeries of life. When star-crowned trees, and the glint of sunlight on flowing waters, subdue you like the thought of one much loved and long dead; when no voice of distress reaches your ears in vain, and no hand seeks your aid without response.When you find good in every faith that helps any man to lay hold of divine things and sees majestic meanings in life, whatever the name of that faith may be. When you look into a wayside puddle and see something beyond mud, and into the face of the most forlorn mortal and see something beyond sin.When you know how to pray, how to love, how hope. When you have kept faith with yourself, with your fellow man, with your God; in your hand a sword for evil, in your heart a bit of a song - glad to live, but not afraid to die!

Tom Hanks is in solid form, playing a solitary survivor traversing a post-apocalyptic world crippled by extreme radiation, while in search of a future home for his companion dog and newly designed robot. Finch is pleasant enough for a quiet Friday evening viewing but I'm not sure there are enough surprises or excitement in this Apple TV+ release to qualify it as a memorable sci-fi movie.",Finch

If not for a couple of scenes, I would have bet that this was a children's movie. Absolutely no depth, been there, done that kind of script, predictable and flat. The main character's stories were so boring, I'm surprised that the robot didn't fall asleep. Speaking of the robot, why make it's voice so annoying? Couldn't Tom Hanks' character have used Alexa's vocals instead? We are beyond the monotonous era already. Movie ""science"" was totally bonkers as a whole, something that I would have forgiven had the script been any more engaging. The only good thing about this was the rendering quality of CGI, albeit even it wasn't very creative. It's an ok watch for a weeknight but pretty sure I won't remember this by tomorrow.",Finch

If you don't like robots like someone in my family does, you will probably not like this movie, but maybe the movie could change your mind. Tom Hanks was great, but the robot stole the show, and even with a dark tone there was some humor, just enough and in the right parts which is important. Through much of the movie I'm saying just what is this about, what is the payoff going to be? You just have to wait until the second half and the end to get the payoff, and it was totally worth it.Some of the reviews really give away too much about the tone or direction. I went in knowing absolutely nothing, never even looked at the trailer, could have been Star Wars for all knew, um it wasn't. I will tell you if you're looking for explosions, gunfighting or edge of your seat excitement you will be disappointed. It's just a good little story about a Man, his dog and a robot. I liked the way it ended, stories have to end but I will play out in my mind what happens after the movie ended.

142,ednk,"Mèh, nothing new, nothing spectacular",5,5 November 2021,"A man (Finch), a dog (Goodyear), two robots. Apocalyptic times on earth, somewhere in the future. What's the story? Finch creates a robot with human features, so that this robot can look after his dog Goodyear, once he dies. Yes, Finch is dying of radiation poisoning. First hour of the movie is about the robot learning to become human. Finch acts out like a grumpy old grandpa. The robot has childish behaviour and needs a learning curve. (Not quit believable, but for the sake of the story, let's get along with it).Into the second hour, there is a revelation how earth became so apocalyptic. Don't expect an intriguing story there. It's pretty plain and simple. The robot finally learns how to act and behave. And the story takes half an hour to become a Disney magic moment. The end. Seriously? Yes, seriously.This type of movie would have been a big succes in the '80s or '90s, but not today. The emo, drama, suspense, it has a all been done before and before and... before. Is this the movie that Apple spend so much money on? Once again, it proves that money and top actors (like Tom Hanks) are not a recipe for success. Don't get it wrong, Tom Hanks delivers like he should deliver, but it all feels too much like a written character on paper.

It's astonishing that a movie directed towards a teen audience has Tom Hanks in it.. they should have gone with a cheaper 20-30 year old and call it quits.

It's also possible for a script to borrow too many ideas from other films (in this case I Am Legend, Silent Running, Chappie and WALL-E) and produce an incoherent mess. Add to this potentially volatile mix the world's most well-known actor simply reprising a role he's already played in another successful solo-performance film and you'd be forgiven for thinking you've seen it all before and just scrolling past Finch. If you do, you'll miss a well-produced, emotionally engaging, very memorable film with top-notch effects and a story so simple a child could understand it: A post-apocalyptic survivor knows he's dying and wants to build a robot to take care of his dog. This leads to a road trip where the robot learns the value of trust and finally builds to the single conceptualised scene that may have been the inspiration for the whole film: Jeff the robot playing fetch with Goodyear the dog in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Minus the zombies and vampires, Finch combines the most well-known elements of post-apocalyptic lore and assembles them in harmony.

163,rich-mac,"A road trip - robot, man, and dog.",8,5 November 2021,"I suspect that expectation has a lot to do with the different responses to this movie. That and the fact that some people seem to demand revelation and ground breaking earth shattering 'events' before they'll move the needle into a reasonable zone of approval. The irony is that Finch does deliver revelation. But because it's subject is the human condition and self reflective, the journey of the soul is looking for and showing different things on this journey on the road than a literal reading can provide.The non-verbal communication recorded between Goodyear (the dog), Jeff (the robot) and Finch (the man) is extraordinary. The make an interesting gang for a road movie, a movie about transformation, acceptance, surrender, about our imagination and it's innate ability to create tangible experience out of intangible elements, and to make the end result seem both plausible and oddly inevitable.The true beauty of this movie lies in how it creates space for it's non-human participants to create pathos and meaning - Finch is the anchor, the point of reference, but it's Goodyear and Jeff that go on the transformative journey, who grow to find acceptance and purpose.So in the end Finch is actually quite a gentle and moving story comprising of a 'telling' in well contained vignettes - a story that doesn't over-reach, but that probably over-achieves. But all the things that I loved about it will be things that someone else uses as their justification for harsh criticism.As a final note, the rendering of Jeff is brilliant - and a pleasant surprise that the subtle gestural movements of a human actor survived the transition into CGI robot. Based on that fact alone, this movie demonstrates how much subtle non-verbal communication we read and understand.8.5/10.",Finch

This time out however, his non-human sidekicks are two robots and a dog, while the paradise Island setting is replaced by a bleak post-apocalyptic world.Forced to hit the road in a solar powered RV from St Louis to San Francisco in order to escape killer weather, Hanks and co run into a few dangerous obstacles along the way, but alas the thrills and spills are few and far between and it all gets a bit dull and boring by the second half of the film's two-hour runtime.Hanks is as dependable as ever carrying the movie while other plus points are the impressively shot apocalyptic vistas, some decent CGI and the endearing (real-life) dog flawlessly played by a former rescue dog called Seamus.

He is a lonely old man who never married, had kids, or any significant relationships. He rescues a puppy named Goodyear from certain death and then becomes obsessed with providing for his welfare after he dies, which will be soon. To that end he creates a cobbled together monstrosity who names himself Jeff for no reason other than he likes the way it sounds.The main body of the film concerns Finch and his rag-tag family which also includes Dewey, an earlier robot, and their quest to reach San Francisco. The destination seems arbitrary but Finch agrees to it in order to get them out of the blighted area where they had been sheltering, a blasted post-apocalyptic St. Louis.The heart of the film is Jeff's development which closely mimics that of a human boy growing from child, to teen, to finally a young adult. He is often disobedient, not a good trait for a 7-foot tall creature with significant tonnage. He is overly remorseful and has to be told repeatedly to stop apologizing, just learn from your mistakes and move on, a conversation I have had with my own son more than once.For most of the journey Jeff's persona is that of a teenager. When he asks to be taught to drive, Finch says he's not ready. Jeff sneaks off and drives anyway because what teenager can resist a set of keys and a quick joy ride when dad isn't looking? In a heartbreaking adventure gone bad, Jeff and Goodyear set off exploring a new city while dad is asleep. Jeff finds a fur lined jacket he falls in love with and puts it on ignoring the obvious signs of danger. As a result, his robot brother Dewey is destroyed. Jeff is despondent, Finch is furious, and Goodyear is frightened. But Jeff still has his beloved jacket which he wears proudly although he knows it is ridiculous.In the end Finch is hopeful if not exactly confident Jeff and Goodyear will be just fine after his death, which comes suddenly. Jeff grieves the old man's death but mindful of his instructions, he moves on with Goodyear in tow.There are those who have branded this film as overly sentimental, saccharine sweet, and nauseatingly sappy. On a certain level they are right, but on a deeper level, Finch is a wonderful exploration of what it means to be truly human.",Finch

But whoever either wrote this film or misinterpreted the screenplay, there are just so many flaws all throughout this film. My first grunge to it was so he feels he must flee far away to avoid this '40' day storm - whether its because he cant feed himself that duration or because his shelter wont withstand it - though soon after his RV can sustain a huge tornado for a few min and boom the storm is gone? If he is such an intellect who can build and create robots why is he not smart enough to have a simple sustainable garden to survive off of? So not sure why he really fled in the first place. But then there's the simple changing of a tire - any person who has ever changed a tire knows the vehicle should be on the ground to tighten or loosen the lug nuts, not lifted up... Just i dunno maybe get super stoned and watch this as a visually cinematic experience and try to ignore all the basic logistical flaws in it.",Finch

186,sad_otter,Can be difficult but it's good,8,5 November 2021,"I think our culture is going askew (shocker, I know) with the post-apocalyptic movies. There's this feeling like they should still follow normal movie beats. Sure life after devastation will be horrible and roving street gangs will eat your cat etc but there's going to be heroism triumphing adversity blah blah. Except that really doesn't work when the best day you can look forward to is a slight break from malnutrition and so on.Point being, it's bleak. It's also a big impending problem that could end up being very real. So fiction is a good place to illustrate that, sure. But don't expect a movie or show dealing w/these topics to leave you feeling good or fulfilled. Rick Grimes isn't going to show up and save the day. Finch does a good job but in doing so it is pretty rough. Some people criticize movies like these for the characters being in unrealistic situations. Finch just happens to be able to build robots in this case. Well, it is realistic because ""normal"" people are going to end up where most people do in these scenarios: Dead.This does give you some hopeful points at the end. I can't really cover any of the story safely. But if you like Tom Hanks and the preview looked good, and you can look at our future semi-objectively, then you'll very likely appreciate Finch.(Zombies are a slightly different thing. I suspect the appeal there isn't the corpses but rather the simplicity of a life where work is rewarded, anyone can do a heroic act, and problems generally have simple solutions e.g. Eat this, shoot that, find somewhere you'll feel sane enough to fool around. Plus almost zero corpses have ever developed a hankering for brains son it's safely fictional)",Finch
187,tlvx,Voice Actor Change?,5,8 November 2021,"I would have probably rated this a 6, considering that it's standard fare entertainment; but there's a point in the film where it seems like an entirely different voice actor takes over the robot's voice, and it's not even all that subtle.Perhaps this gaffe was due to the pandemic. But still, the producers should have ensured that the robot's voice was consistent, throughout. If the initial voice actor couldn't finish the project, for whatever reason, they could have certainly just dubbed right over the initial voice with the second voice actor.As far as the story, it's pretty much what you see in the trailer. Except that it didn't seem quite as thrilling as the trailer portrays it.There are a few easter eggs from previous Hanks' films, but that's the extent of this film's cleverness.Overall, it has a warm undertone, but the film tries to force the viewer into feeling something... and so it doesn't really hit home in the end.",Finch

There are clever homages in Finch to that earlier film, as there are in other movies that employ this well-worn plot, both live-action and animated, like Wall-E.As long as one can set aside the 'silly science' this movie is based on, ignore the many suspension of belief plot holes, and if you're a Tom Hanks fan, you will enjoy this film.

The moment Dewey gets it hurts you and the scene Jeff hugs Tom breaks you!Not what I expected but an unexpected suprise!,Finch
229,mewener,Really enjoyed the time watching Finch,8,8 November 2021,"A nice story about a not so nice future. Tom Hanks is made for roles like this one. Great relationships between Finch ,Goodyear the dog and Jeff the robot. Oh yes and Dewey. I felt the pace was good and the story believable. Solar flare happened to the earth and global warming doesn't help. Finch builds a robot to take care of his beloved dog Goodyear for when he is no longer around. They go on a road trip because where they are is becoming more and more inhospitable.",Finch

That's like saying the movie Paul was just another Simon Pegg / Nick Frost movie and forgetting Seth Rogan played any part in it at all.I loved the movie, but I'm a sucker for robots so perhaps I'm partial. The special effects are great and simply put, it's 2 great actors in a very heartfelt story that speaks so clearly to how fragile our humanity really is.",Finch

But it would have worked if the writing was stronger in regards to character development. IE the relationship between Finch and robot Jeff who was a miracle of robotics too good to be true. Particularly its strength was impossible given the size of the hydraulics on the unit.And it was annoying as hell the way he constantly yelled at Jeff for making understandable mistakes.Oh.

If you did, you'd understand how profound this film is, despite how simple it might have looked on the surface. People this day and age like big, extravagant, shiny, new stuff... But underneath it all though, if you really think about it, it's really the core that matters.

Uhhh... that's the whole basis of this damn movie! 🤣What revelations about humanity did this story unearth that hasn't already been taught by Dr. Seuss?There's so much bias favoring the status quo in Hollywood, it's no wonder there's so much back-patting for less-than-mediocre projects like this one.",Finch

I see some people on here complaining about the cgi but actually I found the cgi to be impressive. There were moments when I forgot it was CGI (I am specifically talking about Jeff the Robot here, the landscape cgi was mediocre.) But i think that comes down to the lighting technicians and designers doing an excellent job blending Jeff into the world with the natural lighting and coloring.Tom Hanks also performs brilliantly as usual, not a complaint about his performance from me.Yes, the movie is cliched and easily predictable but I still enjoyed it.",Finch

Oh well, you cannot please everyone. I didn't have any expectations and absolutely LOVED the film.The philosophy, the Isaac Asimov notes and the possibility our world can end up like this where people will be afraid of each other is depressing but somehow the film was actually hopeful.

258,ictmax,I just couldn't!,2,7 November 2021,The movie tried to humanize a robot but I just couldn't sympathize with the premise. The film was stretched with emptiness to fill the required time. I found it very boring with a cliche role I have seen before by Tom Hanks.,Finch

If a person is going to set a giant bear trap and lure someone to their death with donuts, why would that same person put a pad lock on a cabinet and store a bunch of food in there?Makes no sense. The type of person who sets traps does not store all their food, even behind lock and key, in plain site.This writer is good at explaining things, yet he does it in a way that lets you know he is aware. When Tom is camping outside, within 1 min, Tom starts to explain why he would not travel at night.This reveals to me that the writer is not that aware of how people act. Smart people are predicable.He can build robots, yet he can't store power with batteries?You could of used the wind turbines to store power and grow a butt ton of food inside. Someone smart would do that and it does not makes sense that they would not.Huge gaps where there is no explanation. Probably because the writer lacks awareness in real life. Had 2 writers. One of them is brand new and one of them has no written in 20-30 years.",Finch

Hanks, the voice actor for the robot, and 3 people that show up in ""flashback scenes"" - I suspect the Casting Director was overpaid.?3. I guess the ozone layer is healthier closer to the ocean?

LIVE A LIFE in the whole sense, can't get the whole range of emotions you could have by seeing this movie.We, humans are molded by our experiences and, since the point of view of Science, Robotics and stuff, being able to transfer the the ability to comprehend and understand this to a sentient being, even if it's ruled by algorithms and computer-generated neural networks, should be enough to get a life fulfilled; of course Finch couldn't be more than agreed with me.It's the dynamic between Finch, Jeff, Goodyear and Duey, that makes it a beautiful film.DON'T expect to see an Oscar award worthy (Tom Hanks perform is awesome, don't get me wrong)... this movie is about treasuring what we have, what is really meaningful, important in life, not material stuff, it's soul-rewarding experiences what's make this movie a journey to your most cherish thoughts.GIVE IT A TRY!",Finch

Can't believe Apple, Hanks and Sapochnik thought this would be a good story to work on. And what is with Apple and these horrible soapy, melodramatic, boring content they've been pushing out. Mediocre at best, most of them, apart from Ted Lasso and Mythic Quest. But like their devices I guess they want to play it safe.",Finch

I had not even read what the story was about before watching this one and it lived up to the Hanks' standard.A heart warming story that made me laugh until I cried. There were a few questions raised, like how did the motorhome survive without the solar panels, and where did the robot get its energy from. However, it's fiction, but when there are details that aims to relate to reality, one ponders over the other details too.Anyway, all together a wonderful story.

People posting cynical reviews saying that the line about elbows on the table is Apple preaching morality miss the entire point. They were pretending to dine as families did back before the end of the world, and elbows on a table is something a parent would say to a child when dining out. People going on about it not being an action film also miss the point. It's not trying to be an action film. Those saying it failed to engage on an emotional level must be pretty hard-hearted. It is enjoyable family entertainment, funny in many places,with emotional scenes and lessons about what makes 'family' and what 'trust' really is. There were echoes of 'Short Circuit' and even a bit of 'I am Legend' as well, of course, of 'Cast Away'. Love every minute of it. Another great result by Tom Hanks.",Finch

I haven't written a review for several years but I couldn't help myself. I'm a huge Tom Hanks fan, he put on a good performance. I agree with all of the Castaway comparisons. He carries the whole movie alone.Tom builds a robot in the apocalypse but there really isn't a good back story on how he did it or why he is only one who survived.But this was such a depressing story from beginning to end. Tom is one of the only people left on earth. Other than the supposedly evil people that chase him that we we never see. His goal is to make it to San Francisco and he never makes it. Half of the movie is spent seeing Tom in pain, coughing, and throwing up blood. His robot and dog do but no hope of finding others.",Finch

331,awpawp,Hard to say the feeling,4,8 November 2021,"I watched the 40min or so then turned myself to fast forward mode. It is true that it is a predictable story. It may guess this is more a cinematographic movie than a director's movie. This story could be shorter. You can tell it is a grow-up type of story, but imagine if this a simple boy and father story, it would have been more touchy. It is new spark to use clockwork robot again after ""Number 5"", but It loses the human connection with each other. Jeff's character is built and triggered by Finch's dialogues all the time, which made the grow-up not believable. There is truly no really conflicts in this movie. It is so visible that it is almost like Deus ex machina over the whole story. For example, do Finch must see the butterflies before he dies? Or would it be better to have more Finch's monologues at the beginning to show the ""travel in the day"" "" and "" people killing each other for food preserved"", than getting Finch deliver it by talking to the robot directly for a 5-10min campfire scene. In other words, teach the robot something deeper please. If a robot knows how to joke at birth, don't you think he also knows what is ""trust""? Joking is more advanced than defining. My 5 year old son would know trust but he won't understand some adult joke yet. Or you say trust then you say don't trust. That just confuses people. Is trust build on interest? After I wrote this, I changed it from 5 to 4.",Finch
332,alexreser,"No narrative, no orignal ideas, no respect for the audience.",5,5 November 2021,"I felt very optimistic as I began watching this movie, eventough I was not expecting it to supersede WALL-E or any other well recieved movie of this kind of genre. I simply came in for a fun experience, hoping for a bit of fast pace action with some justifiable underlying story. The movie would probably be entertaining nontheless for me as I generally just appreciate robots and engineering portrayed in films. Well, the engineering part was maybe five minutes during the assembly of the robot. The robot part I will get into on how it failed terribly. But the rest, the part about a somewhat action packed story? Nonexistant. The whole synopsis of the film can be condensed in to this one sentence: ""Man builds robot to watch over dog when man dies from cancer."" Apart from that you have quick bits of spectacles when the protagonists are trying to endure harsh weather conditions, escaping from some thugs whom you never even get to see in person and Hanks trying to teach his robot some day to day stuff. This movie solely relies on the audience's love for Tom Hanks, human empathy for cute, whimpering dogs and the comedy of a super silly robot that takes everything too literally. This was not clear to me untill I entered the second half of the movie. So far, I had had my hopes up for some interesting plot to unravel where Hanks and his team had to work together against some superficial threat that wasn't tornadoes or UV exposure. Rather something like the typical good guys save innocent people, good guys deal with bad guys scenario. Sadly, Hanks had to make a hasty left turn and the movie went down a completly different route. Instead of even a single interaction with some other characters, Hanks and his crew drove of for Hanks to die from radiation poisoning and getting buried during a 4 min long sequence with the same sad aucustic melody played all throughout. After I had endured that painfully long and inauthentic sequence I realized this m ovie was just a complete joke. A bet between producers of whom could come up with a premise so bad that would be marketable regardless thanks to an audience consisting of Tom Hanks loving, animal loving, ignorant morons. Then of course, Tom Hanks wasn't the problem with this movie at all, in fact it was quite the opposite. Without him it wouldn't have worked, the movie would have been unwatchable from the beginning. But finding an A list Hollywood actor and giving him a dog and a robot are far from the sole ingrediants of a compelling movie. Comsidering the early reviews however, people don't seem to mind how poorly the plot is executed and the countless hollywood cliches that appear along the way. Sad to see how far the standard has sunken and how tolerable people are to these kinds of movies nowadays. Shame on Hollywood and shame on poor taste.",Finch

Sounds good on paper, right?Sure does...except the movie missed out on important plot points like character development and background story that could've made it far more entertaining to watch. It would've done a far better job if it could have had Tom Hank's character explain his backstory in more detail before the solar flare apocalypse. What happened immediately after the apocalypse? What did he do during the subsequent societal collapse? How did he survive for so long? Instead, the viewer only gets some scattered exposition about what he did and some lousy flashback when he was looking for some food. Talk about a wasted opportunity. And that's not even getting into how little the robot's character develops because of how short the movie is.Overall, still a good flick, but the movie's plot wasted a lot of its initial potential. It would be far more fit for a multi-season long TV series than squeezing it down to a rather short movie.",Finch

You see a robot who operates without any energy for many years. Pull up cars with 1 hand? No problem. Why? How? No one explains. But at the same time they need solar/wind power and gas for no reason. Can't you just find and use another ""source of infinite energy""? Instead Finch rides regular Komatsu hd465 truck that consumes enormous amount of gas he gets from nowhere I guess. And if that guy was so smart and has a huge wind turbine why he don't grow vegetables in his bunker with aeroponics? And water is still available under the ground. All that's so obvious and at the same time not important to the authors. If feels like a costumed party not sci-fi. Snotty stories is all this movie is about. What a shame.",Finch
366,sarrmd,SUCH A DECENT MOVIE,10,7 November 2021,I really enjoyed watching the movie. I noticed a small odd things when Finch entered the Restaurant and the cops were still on the table after the fact that so many storms occurred in that city.,Finch
367,annieeastie,Fabulous film !,10,7 November 2021,"I can not understand the bad reviews! This film was excellent...not one bit boring. I seldom write reviews & nearly did not watch it, because I read the reviews on here. I am so glad I did watch it.It is heart warming..heart felt..wonderful. Tom Hanks is amazing. I really hope that Geoff will carry on this tale! Watch it.",Finch
368,galvanicmass,Just watch the film and judge for yourself,8,7 November 2021,.......that's alllllllll I need to say. I hate people that moan......... 150 characters to explain how people moan about a movie.......let me see.........well.... Tom hanks..a robot and a dog.......kids will love it no doubt.......... I always say give anything a watch once. If u like it watch it again. If u don't....keep it to yourself. Doesn't spoil the fun for others......enjoy.,Finch
369,bebedoc-30174,Movie feels rushed...,6,7 November 2021,"The movie has great acting from Tom Hanks, good visuals, soundtrack, etc. But the most problematic aspect is that it seems to be missing a central narrative plot. This makes the movie have a very superficial, underdeveloped story. It would seem as there was pressure to release it early which prevented the team from filming all scenes and making a complete movie.",Finch
370,kaizerarush,Though one man show...but it worths every penny.,9,8 November 2021,"What a movie I must say,a machine,a man and a dog...and bonding between them. A must watch for kids and if you are sad feeling everything in your world is going haywire.....watch Finch.It's very tough to depict the most complex things;our feelings in a simple way. But Mr. Hanks is best in it.",Finch
371,falahammar,A HUMAN JEFF,10,8 November 2021,The director of the film focused on instilling hope within every person who loves life and peace and kept away from all scenes of violence in this film despite the harsh nature of Cairo.. There is always a ray of hope that every person can find if he makes an effort to survive and abandon despair.. Having a friend by your side is a matter Positive make you able to overcome all difficulties. Greetings from the heart to the wonderful actor Tom Hans.,Finch

It's one of the best films of the year, and I'm glad I was able to see another strong film from the King of Worlds, Tom Hanks. I'm glad I was born to watch Tom Hanks play As a young actor, I learned great things from this emotional film. I hope Tom's brilliance continues and thank you for your good site for doing this poll.",Finch
373,shanfan-58371,Bit soppy for sci-fi but Tom Hanks is good!,7,8 November 2021,"The concept is really interesting, and scenes like the hospital scene really had me hooked. I felt like the robot developed far too quickly to make the development meaningful (how did it know to build a pyre like that?!), and for a dying man Finch was not all that sick. Though if you don't like gore I suppose that's good, but they could have ramped it up a little bit more solely for some drama. But for a feel-good post-apocalypse, a solid choice.",Finch
374,dqdkwgqrg,Boring as hell,3,9 November 2021,"And yet another movie where nothing is happening, it seems they did not even have enough money to pay more than one actor, what a waste of time... I do not call this sci-fi, there is no sci-fi elements, just boredom...",Finch
375,zorrpop,Movie with a Soul,9,5 November 2021,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and found it to be a breath of fresh air. It is a short list of actors whom could make this story work .Tom Hanks and I don't know who else. It wasn't at all what I expected and for that I am grateful. A heartfelt adventure tale in the future.,Finch
376,jvoelke,CASTAWAY WITH ROBOTS,7,6 November 2021,"This movie is the same as castaway with robots, but with more dialog. I did however enjoy it. The robot part is very well done. I think another actor would have done better. If you're bored and have nothing to do, this is Worth a watch.",Finch
377,gonengokalp,It was just painful to watch,1,6 November 2021,Story driven by vey easy solitiouns. They are all cliche and it is really hard to stay focused since it doesn't offet anything new at all. I like the design of the robot and how it is executed but you cannot watch a feature to just enjoy this.,Finch
378,Tommy238,Robot sounds too much like Borat.,6,8 November 2021,"Anyone else think the robot sounds like Borat? I liiike. Not sure what to make of it I wanna hear other people's opinion on it. Besides Borat the film was fine, but on the whimsical side of things rather than the blood soaked volleyball, so realize it has all the weight of a sports movie.",Finch
379,rcline-2,Best performance by a robot,7,7 November 2021,"No real spoilers here, but aimed at those who have seen the movie.Caleb Landry Jones gives a superb motion capture and voice performance, with a natural comic timing working together with Hanks. Combined with the post-processing excellence, I totally bought into the character.The Jeff character started the movie using an emotionless robotic voice with an obvious software-programmed quality. By the end of the movie, he had developed his own personality and, interestingly, displayed clear internal human emotions. We've come a long way from Robbie the Robot.",Finch
380,doulosjj1992,Emotional Greatness,10,7 November 2021,"For whatever reason folks seem to disregard this film and seemingly wish it did not exist. I read a review on the L. A. Times and because of that overly negative review I was going to completely skip this film. I am very thankful I didn't. The film was two hours but it felt like 40 minutes. There are a lot of modern films that truly fit the definition of boredom, this is not one of those. The film highlighted the character's surroundings wonderfully and honed in on the emotions of Finch, the dog and Jeff. The trio of characters and their relationship, which ultimately culminated in the end was phenomenal and the positive and powerful emotions brought out by this film make it worth the watch. Tom Hanks is truly brilliant in this and there are not many actors who could bring out what Caleb Landry Jones did with Jeff. Jones was present with Hanks every day during the shooting and you can tell. I wonder which films the people who trash this one love and why they love them. I assume that they hold films like the Avengers saga at the top of their list...",Finch
381,author-jamie-dodson,AI to the rescue,10,8 November 2021,Tom Hanks delivers Another marvelous performance as on the last people on earth and his dog. As good as Hanks was I think the robot named Jeff stole the show. It's dystopian but I think you could let your kids watch too.,Finch
382,mib1424,Exactly what expected from Tom Hanks,10,5 November 2021,The movie has amazing story. It feels like another season of the legendary cast away movie. It has a lot of emotions with an excellent mix between sad and happy feelings.,Finch
383,ghanim_yas,The credits are for the dog,7,7 November 2021,"The film is OK, Tom Hanks performance as as always, brilliant, but best actor in this one in my opinion is the dog, he made the film soft and and interesting to watch, I recommend.",Finch
384,tehreem1990,One of the best for me!,8,6 November 2021,"Like so many other reviewers who liked the movie, I'm a bit baffled by those who didn't like it. For me it hit all the right spots and sure it's not the most original dystopian movie with a mixture of WALL-E (I am all for Tom Hanks in the role of WALL-E, one of my favorite animated characters ever) and The Martian, but what is original anymore? Even Squid Game wasn't really original but masses of people still liked the show. Anyways. I'm not OK with the ending. I will never be OK with an ending where THAT happens!!! Now I shall go and hug my cat.",Finch
385,ntabbert,Tom Hanks never disappoints,8,10 November 2021,"All though there are things I would change in this movie if I was the producer... overall, I Iiked this flick.The movie was spot on with what an apocalyptic world would look like... with stores bare and the few survivors being ferocious.I think Hanks' character could have been a little softer on Jeff... BUT his objective was engineering a robot to take care of Dog... as his death from radiation exposure was inevitable. A feel good movie... making you appreciate human devotion.A touch slow at times... but not a bad thing, as I never want a Tom Hanks movie to end.",Finch
386,leroyjnr1,Can Tom Hanks ever be in a bad movie?,9,10 November 2021,"This movie was something else, it is not your normal sci-fi movie with endless action packed nonsense. This is a feel-good ""great"" from Tom. I recomend it for anyone wanting to drif away for a while from a heavy action packed kick and shoot movie.",Finch
387,drddutcher,Wilson?,1,6 November 2021,Never thought I would see Hanks trade Wilson in on a robot. Nothing about this movie deserves more than a rating of '1'. Sorry to offend all Hanks' fans.,Finch
388,cm-fraser,Exactly what you think it will be,5,5 November 2021,"Just ok. In every sense. Nothing new, nothing interesting, but Tom hanks is charming. There is nothing else deeper. Just a bit dull. Direction, cinematography? All great. But it's like a team thought? How can we sell Tom hanks in an apocalyptic world? Then just made the story about that.",Finch
389,m-nickahd,Are we just the place holders?,7,9 November 2021,"In a world that is not suitable anymore for humans, something that isn't that far off in our own reality, a man, the only human we see in the present, prepares his dog and a robot for life without him, all the while keeping them away from any possibility of meeting other humans ""who mean you harm"". It certainly seems like the only good thing the man can do is to leave the world to these nonhumans who will be to able to adapt and leave in peace. However, the most important part of the movie is when all three of them, human, nonhuman animal, and robot, all leave together and take care of each other without any form of master-slave relationship. The robot is treated as a person and won't accept ""a tool's name"" and the dog is "" a he, not an it,"" and is ""not my dog, he's his own dog"". If we can't live in peace with the others, we eventually can be, at best, place holders for those that can live after us.",Finch
390,hwereda,Finch is the icon of intimacy,8,7 November 2021,"Although his solitude but Finch helped to create that hidden sympathetic bond ""the machine"" which will stay for a while. Tom hanks still giving the intimacy of life the huge contribution that should be.",Finch

393,pgregory-63701,Uninspired Cliché in a Fancy Packaging,2,6 November 2021,"I suppose anything with Tom Hanks will make a buck and that's what producers saw in Finch but from a narrative point of view, and you have to know audiences have seen heaps of post-apocalyptic movies by now, this is uninspired and unoriginal. What bothered me during this film is how much it borrows from other films such as Wall-E,The Road and, well, Cast Away! This movie adds nothing to the genre whether from a storytelling perspective or a technical perspective. It's well made because it has ample budget but it's forgettable and feckless.",Finch
394,karonionik,I've expected more,7,9 November 2021,"First half of movie i was so excited and didn't think i would bad.But in second part movie turned the wrong way with cliche and unreallistic drama related to the robot. There are some things like: robot started to see dreams, fee pity etc. And it supposed to work for drama, but it didn't.7\10 only for Tom Hanks and nice first part.",Finch
395,shorooqmohd,The movie of the 2021 year,9,8 November 2021,Thanks alot for Tom Hanks and his brilliant messages and works that he all the time gives to us.Actually I do believe that Tom knew that this is not only a science fiction movie but it's also a simulation of our world now and how people became hungry and ready to kill each other not because of COVID19 but because of ourselves and how we dealt and still dealing with it..,Finch
396,ntonamadora,One-Man-Movie,10,9 November 2021,It's a good movie that don't deserve 1-5 rating. The message is loud and bold it is must watch movie for all ages. This is another archieve of Hanks good movies and even deserve an acting recognition.,Finch

398,felipeandrescinema,"Love the dog, love the robot, and love the human.",7,9 November 2021,"""Finch"" from 2021 is the new Apple TV movie starring the beloved Tom Hanks. This story shows us the desire of a human to have a specialized caretaker to protect his dog, within a post-apocalyptic time.I don't want to be too specific in the plot of this film, so you will enjoy the experience better and enjoy it more.This movie is as moving as it is moving. With the passing of time, robots have become more adorable beings than human beings themselves, they show that within a robotic body, various characters can be stored to understand the true meaning of life. On the other hand we have Finch, a human being who has survived an apocalypse on planet earth, one of the few living souls who still have a heart and consciousness within such a complex time, he is like Forrest Gump in a very distant future.In conclusion, if you are a lover of Tom Hanks movies, you will definitely love the movie in all its splendor, full of a kind heart and that will make you aware of our present time, we must take care of our environment.",Finch
