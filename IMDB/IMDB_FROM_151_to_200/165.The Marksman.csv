0,SnoopyStyle,needs a few changes,6,11 September 2021,"Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson) has a shrinking property on the American Mexican border. The bank is foreclosing on what's left of his property including the hill where he spread his late wife's ashes. Her medical treatments had drained their life savings. He often finds illegals crossing his property. One day, he comes across Rosa and her son Miguel. They're on the run from the Mexican cartel. Jim gets into a gun battle and kills one of the cartel gunmen. Rosa is killed. Eventually, Jim is on the run with Miguel. Jim's stepdaughter Sarah Pennington (Katheryn Winnick) is a border agent.This needs a few script changes including several situations during the final confrontation. There are some bad old fashion holdouts with the ending. Jim would never lay down his gun. As soon as that happens, both him and the kid would be killed. The biggest change I would make is to get rid of the money. It muddies Jim's motivation in helping Miguel. It would also heighten the danger by taking away a resource. In addition, Jim should have used the money to buy a car. The bad guys know the car and he knows the bad guys know it after the corrupt cop. It's also shot up to heck and on its last legs. Another change is Miguel's declaration that he wants to go home. Here's the deal. The kid is written as a real smart character. He wouldn't be dumb enough to want to go home where he can expect certain death. Overall, I like this lone marine who wants to do the right thing and Liam Neeson playing it. The script for this simplistic story has a few flaws that needs cleaning up.",The Marksman
1,claudio_carvalho,Reasonable Thriller,5,2 July 2021,"In Arizona, the rancher Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson) lives alone in the Mexico border. Jim is a former Marine and widower that misses his wife, who died of cancer, and is completely broken since he spent his savings in hospital bill. His stepdaughter is Sarah Pennington (Katheryn Winnick), who is a border patrol agent, and Jim usually reports illegal crossings nearby his lands. When he sees the Mexican Rosa (Tereza Ruiz) and her son Miguel (Jacob Perez) attempting to cross the border, he reports to the border patrol but soon he learns that they are trying to escape from the drug cartel. Jim protects them and kills the brother of the cartel's leader Mauricio (Juan Pable Raba). However, Rosa dies too but she gives the address of her family in Chicago and asks Jim to deliver Miguel to her family. In return, she offers her bag that is full of money. The border patrol takes Miguel but soon Jim finds that the Mauricio wants to revenge the death of his brother and decides to help the boy, driving him to Chicago but with the cartel on their tail.""The Marksman"" is a reasonable thriller with a formulaic plot. Liam Neeson has great performance in a depressing role of a former marine that has no spot to die since he lost his lands and savings in the medical treatment of his beloved wife. The plot has holes and maybe the worst part is when Miguel and he burn the cartel money in a campfire. The conclusion is very sad. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Na Mira do Perigo"" (""In the Target of Danger"")",The Marksman
2,nogodnomasters,I didn't have a choice,4,1 February 2021,"James Hansen (Liam Neeson) owns a ranch in Neco, Arizona on the border. He hasn't made any payments in six months and is surprised when the bank forecloses. The cartel is chasing a mother and child across the border and we all know the script from here.It seems all Liam Neeson films are anti-climatic since ""Taken.""

3,sunwarrior13,Our Late Career Action Hero Liam Neeson Is Back As Clint Eastwood In The Marksman,7,21 February 2021,"Our late career action hero Liam Neeson is back in what Clint Eastwood have starred decades of his acting career as Jim Hanson in ""The Marksman"".Katheryn Winnick co-stars in this film directed by Robert Lorenz.In it,we get to see an Arizona border patrol member who protects a young Mexican boy who is desperately fleeing from the assassins of a cartel. As he gets to the border in Arizona,we get to see the cartel pursues the young boy as the latter gets to land in the US.The movie was definitely serviceable at best. No question that Liam Neeson delivers as Jim - the marksman - which is enough to make it entertaining. Also, we get to see him morphing into the new Clint Eastwood. Evidently, Neeson will continue to delight his movie fans (me included) with the future action thrillers that has yet to come.",The Marksman
4,CinemaSerf,"Same old, same old!",6,8 November 2021,"""Jim"" (Liam Neeson) is a former US Marine who has a failing ranch on the Mexican border. When he encounters a couple of illegal immigrants that are being pursued by some thugs from a drugs cartel, the mother is killed and he flees with her young son only to be pursued across America by these gun-toting' hoodlums. This film is a dreadfully routine vehicle for the star that reeks of implausibility from start to finish. Leaving a trail (that a blind elephant could follow) of murder and devastation behind them, they spend a couple of days trying to reach Chicago whilst there appears to be little effective sign of the law enforcement folks led by the sparingly used Kathryn Winnick - this time without her Viking garb. The kid ""Miguel"" (Jacob Perez) and the baddie-in-chief ""Mauricio"" (Juan Pablo Raba) are really straight out of Central Casting, and the whole thing just has an inevitability about it that robs it of any jeopardy before an ending that you just knew was going to happen. It's poorly scored, and adequately photographed - just don't expect anything new.",The Marksman
5,zardoz-13,Misses the Mark,5,6 February 2021,"The cliches fly like bullets in ""Trouble With the Curve"" director Robert Lorenz's formulaic cartel thriller ""The Marksman,"" with rugged Liam Neeson as a troubled ex-Marine who swaps lead with murderous Mexican cartel killers on a road trip to Chicago. Tom Hanks took an orphan girl across Texas to her relatives in ""News of the World,"" and Neeson takes a Mexican boy from Arizona to Illinois in this modern-day crime melodrama. When a mom and her son scramble across the border on foot with cartel gunmen at their heels, a widowed American rancher, Jim Hanson intervenes with his rifle and thwarts their pursuit with gunfire. Now, ""The Marksman"" isn't a movie bristling with wall-to-wall violence. Several people die, and some die off-screen. Nevertheless, this predictable but complicated, PG-rated, pursuit yarn often stretches credibility to the breaking point. Lorenz and freshman writers Chris Charles and Danny Kravitz give us nothing we haven't seen already in gritty, suspenseful sagas like ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007), ""Savages"" (2012), ""End of Watch"" (2012),""The Last Stand"" (2013), Sicario"" (2015), its sequel ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" (2018), ""Miss Bala (2019), ""Peppermint"" (2018), and ""Rambo: Last Blood"" (2019). Instead, Lorenz and company recycle moldy cliches and stale stereotypes, with few surprises. Occasionally, our seasoned hero has some ""Rambo"" moments, but few and far between are these. Our protagonist often behaves like he has never seen a television crime show. This 107-minute movie may unravel your patience. Not only has our hero forgotten everything he learned in two tours of Vietnam, but he also doesn't realize they are tracking him via his credit card purchases. Indeed, the Liam Neeson character makes several appalling mistakes during his flight that will infuriate audiences who craved his ""Taken"" movies.
Jim (Liam Neeson of ""Cold Pursuit"") has fallen on hard times with no relief in sight. After cancer claimed his wife, an avalanche of medical bills descended on him, and he cannot pay them. Now, his friendly banker warns him he is 90 days away from eviction from hearth and home. Basically, Jim is a lost soul when he nearly runs down a young migrant woman, Rosa (Teresa Ruiz of ""Bordertown""), and her 11-year-old son Miguel (newcomer Jacob Perez) who have abandoned everything in their flight to Arizona. Rosa's ill-fated brother Carlos (Alfredo Quiroz of ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"") who served as a courier for the cartel let his greed doom him. Moments before the cartel catches up with him, Carlos warns Rosa to vamos before they come for their pound of flesh. The cartel makes examples of their own when they betray them. Jim didn't have enough to worry about before he nearly collided with Rosa and Miguel in the road, he does now. Basically, the border wall fence lines Jim's ranch in southern Arizona, and the rancher is dutifully making his rounds when he catches these innocents trespassing. During a brief firefight, Jim drives off the killers, but not before poor Rosa takes a slug and dies at the scene. Mind you, things are about to get far worse. Now, Jim wrestles with his conscience because he feels responsible for Rosa's death. The cartel retreat to lick their wounds, and Jim calls the Border Patrol. Before she died, Rosa had pleaded desperately with Jim to help them. Now, as guilt sets in, Jim realizes he must help Rosa's son. If Miguel is deported back to Mexico, the cartel will turn him into one of their own.
Up until this point, ""The Marksman"" has shown promise. We want our tough guy hero with a heart of gold to save Miguel and slaughter these cartel crazies. However, everything falters when Jim asks to see Miguel at the Border Patrol Station. Just before he walks into the facility, Jim spots Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba of ""Peppermint"") and his minions waiting outside the station. Now, all the Border Patrol Agents are chummy with Jim because his stepdaughter, Sarah (Katheryn Winnick of ""Failure to Launch""), works there as a Border Patrol Agent, too. Inside the station, a Border Patrolman against his better impulses gives Jim a moment with Miguel because he must catch an urgent call. Our hero displays his sense of audacity when he ushers little Miguel out of the holding room as well as the Border Patrol Station in plain sight of everybody. Nobody spots him on the surveillance monitors, and he cruises off with Miguel sitting beside him in his battered pick-up truck. Mind you, during the abortive firefight at the border, the cartel riddled Jim's truck with a hail of gunfire. Incredibly, Jim hasn't bothered to repair the damage, so he has been driving around with a punctured radiator, but he hasn't noticed it leaking! Jim plans to take Miguel to his relatives in Chicago, but Miguel isn't talking to him.
Miguel holds Jim responsible for his mother's death. Nevertheless, these two will forge a friendship that defies ethnicity and age. Jim makes his second mistake when he trusts his truck to hold together with a patch job after Mauricio and company had peppered it with bullet holes. Incidentally, Jim doesn't have a cell phone because he has no one to call. One of the grimmest scenes occurs when Mauricio pumps a vulnerable female gas station clerk full of bullets when she refuses to help him. Like Mauricio's hoodlums, we are outside the convenience store when the gun shots ring out with ominous clarity. If the villains were despicable when they strung up Carlos from an overpass, the murder of the helpless girl makes them cold-blooded dastards. Eventually, our noble hero catches a slug in the gut, and Mauricio dices him up with a knife to ribs. A sentimental saga with a dreary ending, ""The Marksman"" never scores enough bullseyes to keep us engrossed in his plight. If you abhor movies where you can guess the outcome long before the heroes and the villains, you're going to be grumbling throughout ""The Marksman.""",The Marksman
6,ferguson-6,Liam on the move again,6,18 January 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Liam Neeson's particular set of skills, and his grumpy face, seem to show up on screen most every January. If there is a surprise to this year's entry, it's that the annual Liam action movie is not directed by Jaume Collet-Sera, as were THE COMMUTER (2018), RUN ALL NIGHT (2015), NON-STOP (2014), and UNKNOWN (2011). Mr. Collet-Sera has apparently traded Liam in for The Rock as his go-to action star. Instead, it's director Robert Lorenz (TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE, 2012) who co-wrote the script with two other first time screenwriters, Chris Charles and Danny Kravitz. As with most (not all) of Mr. Neeson's aging-action-hero films, this one is both watchable and forgettable.Jim Hanson (Neeson) is a struggling Arizona cattle rancher. He's also a flag-flying former Marine, who carries a walkie-talkie so he can immediately inform the Border Patrol whenever he spots ""IAs"" (illegal aliens) crossing his land. Jim is a shell of his former self ever since his beloved wife passed away. He spread her ashes on the hill next to his rundown home ... a home that sits on land in the final stages of bank foreclosure. Her daughter Sarah (Katheryn Winnick, ""Vikings"") is part of the Border Patrol and periodically keeps tabs on Jim.Although he never seems to care much for those crossing the border, Jim's quick to offer a drink to anyone stranded and injured, even as he calls the Border Patrol. A young boy and his pleading mother are no different until a carload of cartel boys show up. The subsequent shootout leaves a couple of people dead and ignites a cross-country cat-and-mouse chase. A previous scene from Mexico taught us that the mother, Rosa (Teresa Ruiz), and her son, Miguel (Jacob Perez), were sent on the run thanks to her brother's crossing of the cartel. Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba, THE 33, 2015) is the intimidating cartel soldier sent to kill the mother and son.The story covers Monday through Saturday, in what would be considered a stressful week for just about anyone. Jim had promised Miquel's mother that he would take the boy to her cousin's home in Chicago, and being the good soldier, he is committed to fulfilling his duty. Along the way, the grizzled old man and the angry young boy bond while driving in Jim's bullet-riddled pickup truck. Hot dogs and hamburgers play a role, but mostly a late confrontation in a barn attempts to add some character development to a story that, to this point, had very little.Filmmaker Lorenz has a history with Clint Eastwood, and offers up a respectful nod to his mentor by including a grainy scene from HANG 'EM HIGH on a motel television. There is surprisingly little political commentary included, which actually adds to the slowness and dryness of the material. Liam Neeson is now 68 years old, and he has developed a nice little niche for himself with these action movies that are interesting enough to burn a couple of hours for viewers.",The Marksman
7,ksf-2,gotta get the kid to safety,6,27 August 2021,"Jacob Perez is Miguel, little guy crossing over from mexico into the U. S. with his sister. And ""the cartel"" is after them. For some reason. Miguel hangs with rancher Jim Hanson (Liam Neeeeeeson), who has his own issues. So rancher Jim promises to take Miguel to family up in chicago. From the border. Every now and then Jim calls Sarah at the Border Patrol (Katheryn Winnick) to say ""Don't worry, I'm taking him to family"". With the cartel still after them. So he must run the obstacle course to get the boy to safety. Philosophical discussion with the gun store owner. Directed by Robert Lorenz. Nominated for Three oscars! And all with Clint Eastwood. Neeson has FIVE projects currently in production, as of today. This film is just very okay. It does have suspense, but there are just too many coincidences to be plausible. Lots of bloody violence.",The Marksman
8,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Above average Neeson action vehicle,7,9 November 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJim (Liam Neeson) is a former Marine, who's recently laid his wife to rest, and whose ranch is about to be foreclosed on by the bank, unless he comes up with a considerable sum of money. As if his life couldn't get complicated enough, he crosses paths with Miguel (Jacob Perez), a young Mexican boy who's fled across the border with his mother, from the drug cartels, led by Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba) who want them dead. After Miguel's mother meets a tragic end, Jim finds himself taking the boy on an erratic cross country trip to get to safety, while rediscovering himself in the process.Liam Neeson is now a certifiable action star. It's hard now to recollect a time when he was ever known as a versatile performer, able to lend his talents to a wide array of different roles and genres. From Taken onwards, he has re-invented himself in this new persona, and there's no going back. It's simply now a case of whether each entry into his action CV will be a good or bad one, and The Marksman, while far from without it's flaws, is certainly a cut above the average.Neeson's Jim has a fairly standard set up for an action hero, the widower who's fallen on hard times. ""It's hard to figure out how a guy can follow the rules all his life, and still come falling down"" (words to that effect) as he muses at the beginning. It compliments this with the equally standard gets-suddenly-plunged-in to-inexplicable-situation plot line, throwing some typically improbable plot devices and generic, one-dimensional villains in to the mix for good measure. What sets it a cut above the average action caper, however, is the deft little touches of depth and nuance that develop between man and boy on their road trip, that gives it an added human touch, such as Jim with sudden cruelty, crushing the boy's belief in Heaven after suffering a personal tragedy (which he later clears up with him) or a more casual discussion, about things like hot dogs in Chicago!At heart, it's still just what it says on the tin, a Liam Neeson action movie, but thankfully it's a cut above the average, with a bit more too it than just the standard fair. ***",The Marksman
9,westsideschl,Cliché,4,23 May 2021,"Very uncreative storyline of an ex-military barely scrapping by on his Texas ranch (of course the nasty banking industry wants to foreclose). The usual family tragedy to add to his woes. The usual daughter in police to aid in his battles. Since he's on the Tex-Mex border his battles are with the cliché cartel characters chasing the stereotypical border crosser.Oddly, cartels making tens to hundreds of millions per year seem unusually concerned about a few thousand being carried by our immigrant. Very cliché chase & fight scenes - not at all realistic.",The Marksman
10,The-Sarkologist,Slow and Dragiing,5,27 January 2021,"At first I didn't really think too much of this film, namely because it was certainly not what you would expect from Liam Neeson. Normally, such a film would have him single handedly take down an entire Mexican drug cartel because, well, he's Liam Neeson and he does things like that. However, this isn't that type of film. In fact I found that it was rather slow and dull. That is until you sit down and think about what they are trying to get across.So, Neeson happens to be a rancher, and an ex-Marine, and he spends his days dealing with Coyotes and reporting illegal aliens that have made their way through the wall (or should I say fence). Anyway, one day he encounters a woman and her child, and as he prepares to take them to the border patrol, some cartel members rock up, and a shootout begins. Neeson then realises that he simply cannot send the boy back, so decides to take him to Chicago.I guess there are two takeaway things from this film, the main one being that many of us really don't understand why it is that people are attempting to enter the United States. There are cases that it is a life and death event, though the suggestion is that while the kid might not be killed, he would certainly not be going back to the world that he once knew - instead he would no doubt end up being another foot soldier for the Mexican cartels.Another thing is the suggestion that the cartels have a lot more influence than is made out. Just because they are based in Mexico does not mean that they have influences, and bases, in the United States. Nor does it mean that the guards along the border are all that pure either, and act to prevent them from entering the US. In fact the suggestion is that the reach of the Cartels, and the ability of many of the soldiers to get into the US is much easier than is realised (and this has been explored in other films as well).Another interesting thing is that Neeson's wife died of cancer, and while it isn't a big thing, it is another subtle thing that exists in the background. It follows the idea of 'don't get sick in America', meaning that a sick family member can easily bankrupt quite a lot of people. This is the situation that Neeson has found himself in, particularly since his farm is on the verge of being repossessed.Okay, it does have something thought provoking aspects to it, but still, I did find that the film was a little slow, and a part of me would have preferred the old style Neeson action flick where he basically single handedly takes out an entire cartel.",The Marksman
11,Floated2,Slow build to a solid drama,6,28 July 2021,"Perhaps this film was mislead to several people as they were expecting a typical action thriller like the Taken films. However this film is more so a road trip type drama with few action scenes in between.It starts off relatively slow but does get a lot better and becomes quite an interesting watch. Liam Neeson is still great at these roles and although the film may be somewhat predictable, there is a certain joy by the film's end.",The Marksman
12,Tweetienator,Rather a Miss,4,7 October 2021,"I don't know what happend to Liam Neeson - his name stood for solid to good movies but in the last few years he starred more and more mediocre to subpar movies. I really like some of his movies like Taken or The Grey, but lately only The Commuter and Honest Thief were okay, other movies rather, well, lets be tender, forgettable entries to his line of work (The Ice Road, Made in Italy, Cold Pursuit). The Marksman belongs to the latter - not a total crash but rather weak boring.

But even his acting isnt top notch in this movie.The bad: this story is so incredibly predictable that I could bet (and win) a thousand dollars for predicting what would happen in every next scene. That's why it never becomes really suspenseful or thrilling. Never.

14,paul-allaer,Liam Neesom vs. the Mexican drug cartel: and the winner is...,5,25 January 2021,"""The Marksman"" (2021 release; 108 min.) brings the story of retired Marine Jim Hanson. As the film opens, a Mexican drug cartel is hot on the heels of Carlos, who calls his family that they need to flee the house. We fo to ""Naco, Arizona"", where Hanson shoots a wolf from long distance. Upon returning to his ranch, he is served eviction papers by the bank for being 6 months late in his mortgage payments. We go to ""the US/Mexico Border, Monday"", and as Hanson is driving his truck, a young boy and his mom are crossing the border just as the cartel arrives on the scene and demand their return. Hanson refuses... At this point we are 10 min. into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Oscar-nominated producer Robert Lorenz (""American Sniper"", :Letters From Iwo Jima""), but only his second movie directing. Here he brings the latest action hero vehicle for Liam Neeson. Nesson, bless his heart, give his all but even he cannot save the weak script that he has been dealt. The entire film is so utterly predicable from the get-go, and feels like it's done strictly by the numbers. Liam Neeson takes on the Mexican drug cartel all by himself. Truly a one man army against the might of the Mexican drug cartel. I wonder who will win that battle... Don't you wonder also? This film is from the same production house that just 4 months ago released the previous Neesom action flick ""Honest Thief"". In fact these Neesom films are coming at us so fast and furious, they now seems to blend in from one to the next. And yet, I and many others kep turning up. Why? Because Neesom is really good at this, for one, and it is like comfort food (comfort film?) in difficult times. Reason I still rate 3 stars when all is said and done.""The Marksman"" opened in theaters in mid-January and I just saw it this past weekend (2ne week of release). The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 10 people, which is above average as COVID-19 continues to rage from coast to coast). If you are in the mood for another serving of Liam Neesom as action film hero and ready to save the world, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventuallay on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Marksman

This is a Liam Neeson action movie, only a Lite version. It's good but you can tell that Liam is getting a little tired and just might be getting too old-I think he is around 68-to be doing action movies. He plays a rancher that lives on the border of Arizona & Mexico-his wife died recently of cancer so he lives alone-and he sees a lot of people sneaking across the border. In fact, he has a walkie talkie that he calls the Border Patrol on whenever he spots any trespassers-they are even on a first name basis. Katheryn plays Liam's daughter that is in Law Enforcement herself. Liam comes across Jacob and his mother crossing over and so he calls his Border Buddies. But before they can show up, Liam runs into Antonio & his friends-who happen to be Mexican Cartel members-looking for Jacob & his mother. The mother doesn't survive the encounter but she does make Liam promise to take Jacob to some relatives in Chicago. From there, the chase is on. Can Liam outrun the Cartel and make it to Chicago, without spreading too much carnage and dead bodies along the way?
It's not a bad movie but it's no 'Taken'.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.

20,kirbylee70-599-526179,THE LAST HERO,8,28 June 2021,"We live in a world without heroes. Not exactly since there are the unsung heroes out there in the military, fire fighters and police forces saving lives on a daily basis. But we don't have those larger than life heroes that people grew up with in the past. No John Glens, no Davy Crocketts, no George Washingtons. Today even some of those heroes are being dismantled by angry protesters who want to judge the actions of the past on the morals of today. This makes people shy away from being a hero due to the microscopic nature of the media both social and mainstream.So we find ourselves living through heroes that are created from the atmosphere instead. Some come at us in the form of game playing. Others through literature. But most come from the movies. The adventures and heroics of larger than life heroes, some who volunteer to do so and others forced into it. THE MARKSMAN tells the story of a hero from that latter category.Liam Neeson stars as Jim Hanson, an Arizona rancher struggling to bet by. Jim works part time in co-operation with the Border Patrol as he rides along the border fence and spots illegals entering the country. Having lost his wife the year before and about to lose the ranch he gets some support from his step-daughter Sarah (Katheryn Winnick) who works for the Patrol but things look bleak.One day while riding the fence Jim comes across a woman and her young son. Rosa (Teresa Ruiz) and Miguel (Jacob Perez) are on the run from the cartel after her brother steals from them. Jim calls in the Patrol and tells her he will take her in, that she should be safe. Before he can do so cartel members led by Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba) arrives. A shootout follows leaving Mauricio's brother dead and Rosa mortally wounded. After they escape she pleads with Jim to take Miguel to her family in Chicago.Still thinking the proper way is the best, Jim takes Miguel to the Border Patrol. Things change when he realizes that someone there is working with the cartel and that Mauricio is about to get his hands on the boy. Entering the facility Jim sneaks Miguel out the back but not before he's seen by the bad guys. The story is set and now it's a race to Chicago with the bad guys in hot pursuit.This film should be an easy one for Neeson. He's perfected the role of the tough guy who knows how to handle a gun and deal with situations like this. Each one has specific talents to quote his line from TAKEN and here Jim is an expert marksman with a medal to prove it. His character spent two tours in Vietnam and he has no problem taking out the bad guys from a distance. But that's the ideal situation and ideal situations are rare in films like this.Knowing up front what type of movie this is going to be the question is how do you put a spin on it that we haven't seen before? In this case it's the young boy Miguel. Neeson may be the down on his luck ex-Marine with the skills but why put himself at risk? It is because of the boy Miguel, an innocent who is in need of someone, a hero, to stand up for him. He does so because it's the right thing to do.At first confrontational the pair eventually come to grips with their situation. On their journey they bond and get to know one another. It is this that makes the movie something different from other Neeson films.With the controversy about the border these days one would think that would have been the main issue here. Thankfully that's not the case and the movie focuses more on individual placed in situations beyond their control instead. In other words no political posturing is seen here, just an action film that delivers the goods. At the same time it feels sort of routine. So if you're a fan of Neeson films like this enjoy.",The Marksman

It's sad to give any liam film a 1 hes one of my all time favorite actors but this film was just not NECESSARY!! Also not giving anything away but the final straw was them burning the money!! What a waste and makes everything they did worth nothing. If I have to tell you why you're a little slow!! Dont bother with this film go back and watch taken or even cold pursuit.,The Marksman

24,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Marksman,7,3 February 2021,"""I don't scare easy"". Of course you don't. You're Liam freaking Neeson. You're the butt-kicking ruler of the AARP. Neeson looking like Sean Penn's older brother with scruff and mustache in tote, stars in 2021's The Marksman.""Marksman"" is another Neeson actioner where Neeson is the antihero, preserver, and everyman all rolled into one. As something about a rancher who tries to protect a kid illegal alien from a nasty cartel, ""Marksman"" is veritable Neeson comfort food. You want to see him in this role, you know he can carry the proceedings, you know he looks cool handling a firearm, and you know he'll deliver a certain level of badassery. At 68 years old, Liam Neeson makes the villains (who are decades younger than him) bow down with bruised envy. All I gotta say to them is ""good luck"".So yeah, The Marksman is also assembly line Neeson. And yup, the film feels improbable with a few plot devices that might have gone AWOL. Still, there's entertainment value to be had with ""Marksman"" being an old, comfortable show a la the man with ""a particular set of skills"". In truth, ""Marksman"" is a savage road trip flick with inching tension, snarling thugs, and roving danger right around the corner. And oh yeah, you never mess with a broken down, former Marine who loves his guns, his steaks, his late wife, and his swigged whisky.""Marksman's"" director (Robert Lorenz of Trouble with the Curve fame) moves things at a fast, tasty clip. Along with the insertion of a paternal relationship, there are unwanted killings, well-staged gunfights, a house burning, and a car chase or two. Lorenz fashions The Marksman as a pseudo Western combined with a version of Gran Torino that doesn't take place in one city. Bottom line: You can ""mark"" The Marksman as a must-see.",The Marksman
25,rannynm,"Disappointing, slow paced, mildly suspenseful",5,5 February 2021,"The Marksman is a slower-paced action film set on the road from Texas to Chicago. The film stars Liam Neeson as Jim, a retiree who's seen better days. There is a strong action storyline but those expecting a shoot-em-up adrenaline rush may want to look elsewhere.Jim's wife has passed away, his finances gutted by the cost of her medical bills, and his decaying ranch adjoining the border to Mexico is under threat since he can't keep up with his rent. Now all he's got is his loyal canine companion and a few days left with his property. On a drive surveying his land, Jim finds a boy named Miguel and his mother Rosa, crossing the border. Members of a drug cartel are hot on their trail, eager to capture the mother and son. A shootout between Jim and their pursuers occurs and Rosa is mortally wounded. As she passes away, Jim makes a promise to get Miguel to their family in Chicago where he'll be safe.The Marksman is a conundrum as an action movie - as for action, it's sparse, save for a few shootouts here and there where Neeson's character gets a chance to live up to his Marksman moniker. When you hear Liam Neeson and action movie within the same breath, you picture Neeson defiantly doling out revenge to those who have wronged him and the people he cares about, which to some extent is what The Marksman becomes. But it plods along its course, steeping you in the everyday life of Neesons' Jim, before putting into perspective the predicament Miguel faces from the cartel members who killed his mother.Jim's encounters with the cartel is only mildly suspenseful. So much of the The Marksman doesn't fully develop Miguel and Jim's dynamic, either. These characters spend so much time together, but, by the end, they only manage to get each other where they need to go, and nothing more. There's humanity, but there's no spark to it. I don't fault the performances, as much as I do a script with not enough meaningful moments for the central pair's bond to supplant itself deeply in the fabric of the movie.I give The Marksman 2 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 for some mild violence and the killing of a dog.

26,nancyldraper,Not quite an action flick or a thriller,6,21 September 2021,"Of course, people will watch this for Liam Neeson and, maybe, Katheryn Winnick, but may be surprised by the talent of young Jacob Perez.

I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Drama}",The Marksman
27,omendata,Road movie...nothing more,5,23 April 2021,"Well it seems Liam has gone down the Nic Cage/Ron Perlman/John Cusack road and just taking any old movie for a paycheque these days. Very sad for such a good actor and still well capable of pulling off a good one!This is just another anti-trump, poor immigrant road movie.Hardly much action and even the action is a bit tame and lame and Liam just seems to sleepwalk his way through this, perhaps he realised it was going to be a bit of a turkeyburger after the first 10 mins.It has its positives with quite lush photography and is more like a travelogue across America than a movie and contains more relatively boring dialogue than the usual Neeson vehicle; some scenes however; particularly regarding his dead wife are quite sad as it must have been quite hard for Neeson to perform them as it was exactly what happened to his real life wife and you can almost feel this in his delivery of those lines. The young chap who plays the boy hardly says a word and his acting is dreadful.It is still a fairly interesting watch and it still gets a fair average 5/10 from me on this one.",The Marksman
28,arungeorge13,More of the same from Liam Neeson! [+42%],4,14 April 2021,"I have no idea how many more of these Liam Neeson's going to keep making; the storyline is basically an excuse for Neeson to play ""good shepherd and saviour"" to someone. While that makes for a believable excuse, given we all like Neeson, the situations get increasingly predictable and dull beyond a point. The action is certainly there but it doesn't form the core of The Marksman. I'd say it's more of a character-driven drama with elements of a road thriller. Strictly speaking, it's standard Liam Neeson fare where only his character undergoes an emotional transition. Nothing, I mean absolutely nothing else really counts here. Is it still watchable? For sure, as is the case with most Liam Neeson flicks. If you've seen any of his work in the last decade, you've seen it all. Only names, settings, and situations change. Also, they really need to stop writing scenes with Neeson on the phone. That's an oversaturated niche in itself.",The Marksman

Reminds me of personal cravings, experiences, issues.",The Marksman
30,IonicBreezeMachine,A serviceable neo western with a good performance by Neeson that overcomes its predictable narrative and lack of emotional weight.,6,23 May 2021,"Widowed Rancher and former U. S. Marine, Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson), operates a struggling ranch near the U. S./Mexico border dealing with financial pressures, unsatisfactory cattle yields, and illegal boarder traffic from drug cartels and struggling migrants that often leaves dead or wounded upon his land. When he comes across Rosa (Teresa Ruiz) and her son Miguel (Jacob Perez) on the run from a gang of cartel enforcers led by Mauricio (Juan Pablo Raba), Jim becomes their reluctant protector and stokes Mauricio's ire when he kills his brother in a shootout. With Rosa killed in the crossfire, Rosa makes a dying request of Jim to deliver Miguel to her cousin in Chicago in exchange for the cash in her possession and along the way elude the cartel enforcers and their connections.Released in 2021, The Marksman marks the second feature film collaboration between Liam Neeson and producer Mark Williams following their previous effort in Honest Thief (which Williams also directed). The Marksman is directed by Robert Lorenz, a frequent producing collaborator of Clint Eastwood having produced a number of Eastwood's directorial efforts since 2002 and even directing Eastwood in the baseball drama Trouble with the Curve. Lorenz is in familiar territory with Neeson playing a similar character to many of Eastwood's later era characters and even utilizing a neo western framework that Eastwood would fit right at home in. The movie is a lean and effective film with good performances and well-staged action sequences and well integrated western iconography into a contemporary setting, but viewers will note its familiarity and how it pales in comparison to other similar contemporary westerns.Liam Neeson is well cast as the weary gunfighter archetype who wiles away his remaining years on his ranch, even if the type has been well worn since the Alan Ladd days of Shane. Neeson plays the character with both the signature intensity and also quiet sadness and anger from his days as a soldier. It's a really strong performance and overcomes its familiarity. Jacob Perez is also quite good as the young boy Miguel and plays off well against Neeson. Juan Pablo Raba as Mauricio is also good as an antagonist who tries to kill our protagonists is effectively chilling and serves as a good counterpoint to Neeson playing the character not too dissimilar from how a bandit leader would be played in a classic western (complete with Mauricio's mocking name for Neeson's character Jim ""Marine Corps"").The movie's script is unfortunately where the film falters. The build-up of the relationship between Jim and Miguel which should be the crux of a film like this pales in comparison to contemporary films of a similar nature such as Logan or News of the World. While the two actors do give strong performances, the script doesn't have much in the way of relationship building moments that give much emotional or thematic weight to resonate with audiences. The movie also has some leaps in logic such as how Jim is able to free Miguel from Border Patrol's custody and extraneous plot elements such as Jim's stepdaughter played by Katheryn Winnick who doesn't add much to the film and could've easily been cut from the movie with no real impact.The Marksman is a serviceable action thriller thanks to strong performances, tight direction, and thrilling action scenes. The movie's familiar and leaps in logic in the opening act undermine some of the stronger points, and there's some extraneous elements that feel like they should've been removed to further develop our two leads and their relationship. The movie pales in comparison to other contemporary westerns such as No Country for Old Man or Taylor Sheridan's films such as Wind River or Hell or High Water, but as is, The Marksman is basic but effective action thriller that'll prove a suitable time killer for most.",The Marksman

The story ain't bad, yet very cliché, the acting is decent, the chemistry between Liam and the kid co-star is alright altough not great either, but the movie itself is a slow drag. Liam Neeson captured lightning in a bottle with Taken many years ago. Not to say he was not a great actor before, but peoples started to see him as a legit action movie star after that movie, yet he keep appearing in what are mostly slow dragged ""thrillers/drama"" these days sold like action movies ?Yes Liam is not really young anymore, i am not expecting full on fist fight goodness like a Scott Adkins flick, but they could certainly have him shoot more guns, have more stunts and car pursuits, exiting stuff that could be done easily with stunt doubles or respecting his age.This movie is VERY slow pace, there is a few action scenes but they are far in between, and altough the premise is mostly the 2 lead on the run of the cartel, there is never much tension.Yet despite all of this, it manage to just entertain you enough to not bore you. Mostly because Liam Neeson has a great presence, he is a recognizable name and like i said the chemistry with the kid is believable. But its obvious this is another ""chainmade"" scripts like the movie industry pull out a gazillion times each year that they feed to a ""big name"" to sell purchases/rentals and make a decent ammount of $. The surprising part is that this movie actually released in theatre as well. No idea if its because there ain't much movies right now due to Covid, but it has everything to be a low budget direct to VOD movie, the likes you see countless times from Nick Cage or Steven Seagal.Overall nothing much else to say, it filled one of my movie nights while being ""ok"" but i will certainly never watch it again.Oh and Katheryn Winnick fans... well she is barely in the movie at all and don't do much, so don't get your hopes too high.",The Marksman

Unfortunately, in the last few years, Mr. Neeson has starred in a string of mediocre movies. ""Taken 3"" is bad beyond description, mainly due to its atrocious editing style. ""Cold Pursuit"" attempted to go the dark comedy route, and in my opinion, missed its mark. ""Honest Thief"" was painfully banal, filled with stilted acting and a noticeable lack of action. And now we have ""The Marksman,"" another entry in the mediocre Liam Neeson movie genre.""The Marksman"" is less of an action thriller and more of a drama, and that's not inherently bad. However, the movie boasts an astounding lack of suspense and tension throughout, plodding along from scene to scene until the inevitable final confrontation - which to the film's credit, is exciting. However, before you have the pleasure of watching that, you have to sit through a long, slow, road-trip style adventure, that lacks any type of thrill. Sure, you'll find one or two intermittent ""action"" scenes during the course of the movie, but these scenes barely contain any worthwhile action. There is a poorly filmed fistfight that lasts about 10 seconds, as well as a mild getaway type of scenario that our hero has to escape from, and that's about it.Because of its lack of action, the main draw of ""The Marksman"" is its actors, namely Liam Neeson and Jacob Perez. Liam Neeson is good with what the script has him do, and I enjoyed his character. A previous member of the Marine Corp, Liam's character, Jim, struggles with alcohol, and is unapologetically atheist, which I found interesting for a character in a mainstream film. While I was originally opposed to watching a movie with a child actor in it, because of how bad child actors usually are, Jacob Perez was, to my surprise, pretty good. He could pull off emotion when he needed to, but mostly he was likeable, and it was enjoyable to watch him and Liam interact. There was some good comedy throughout, and some interesting conversations between the two characters, but that leads me into some more negatives.Unfortunately, for a movie that is so dialogue heavy, a lot of the dialogue was very boring. There were so many opportunities for the characters to argue or engage in a verbal battle because of their own respective beliefs and morals, but the script took the easy way out it seems, instead employing a large use of exposition. Additionally, for a movie that takes place on the road, it doesn't look very good. The cinematography and directing is very basic, almost as if this was originally a made for television film that at the last minute the studios decided to release in theatres.When the action starts, it is exciting, specifically the battle at the end. Liam pulls off some badass moves, and he puts his rifle to work. However, at this point the movie was too little, too late, and I was so disengaged that I was more looking forward for it to end. In case it wasn't clear - I still love Liam Neeson, and I'll never stop watching his movies. However, at the end of ""The Marksman,"" I almost found myself asking if I should even bother anymore.",The Marksman

Rosa is hit and dies leaving Jim to care for Miguel to take him to his family in Chicago. The Cartel wants the money that Miguel's uncle Carlos (Alfredo Quiroz) stole and gave to Rosa.The rest of the movie is Jim and Miguel on the road to Chicago. Maurico and his men monitor their path all along the way. Jim constantly makes the mistake of using his credit card and the Cartel people are watching for this to see where Jim and Miguel are. Jim and Miguel learn to trust each other.Notables: Katheryn Winnick as Sarah, a Border Patrol Agent who constantly tries to help Jim; Dylan Kenin as Randall, one of Maurico's men; Charles David Richards as the gun store owner who Jim buys guns from: Vic Browder as the Trooper who stops Jim and waits for Maurico and his men; Tommy Lafitte as the Minister who says comforting words to Miguel for Rosa his mother.A very pretty Katheryn Winnick is a master in all kinds of Martial Arts disciplines (check her out on Wikipedia), but her role here is kind of limited and she doesn't do any martial arts. And, yes, Liam Neeson's ""skills"" aren't fully shown in here as we are used to seeing in other movies. Bummer.This is a good Road Movie with Jim and Miguel trying to get to Chicago with Cartel men on their tails. There is limited action until the end, but it is spectacular when Jim takes out the vehicle Maurico is in. (7/10)Violence: Yes.Sex: No.Nudity: No.Humor: Kinda.

59,ivanmessimilos,Standard Liam Neeson movie,6,25 January 2021,"This is only the second film by director Robert Lorenzo. Who's he? Exactly. He is best known as an assistant director and producer of mostly Clint Eastwood films and some great ones like Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. His first solo film is Trouble with the Curve where the main role is played, surprisingly, by Clint Eastwood himself. I really liked that movie. The difference between this and this film is the script, this time he wrote it himself and it is not good at all. It is often predictable, one-way, and uneven. Overall though, I can't judge the film with Liam Neeson where he plays himself badly. He will turn 69 this year, and he is still making films like this. I call this a typical Liam Neeson movie, if you've watched one in the last ten years, you've watched it all. A gloomy man with a difficult and vulnerable past who does not look for troubles but they find him, and he possesses special skills that he is forced to use. The good thing about movies like this is that you know you're going to get what you expected, and all of those movies are good or very good, they won't disappoint you. Same thing with this movie. If you're going to look for holes in the script or criticize the characters, then this is not the movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that will entertain you or take a break from your commitments for a hundred minutes, and you're a fan of Mr. Neeson like me then I can definitely recommend this movie to you.",The Marksman

61,Lewis_Heather787,This film offers nothing new !,4,3 February 2021,"""The Marksman"" has the promise of being a good film, however then you realise its got Liam Neeson staring, its an action film and its being released in January (a notorious dumping ground for nothing but quality product lol) The funny thing is I think I've seen this film a million times, well at least a version of it. It is one of the most stereotypical, dull, boring, re-treads about the US Mexican order and the cartels. This film doesn't really offer anything new to that very unique genre and trust me there are so many better films than this one.The only thing saving this film is Liam Neeson, without him this would be a horrifying disaster. There is an attempt to create a relationship with his character and the little kid but its just boring. I just hope this is the last time I see Mr Neeson in an action film being the prominent star. That time has past now, please move on and go back to being involved in some great drama or some ensemble films. I still think he is a terrific actor however these days he is coasting along staring in B-rate action films. There was also an attempt to build development between him and a cop but that failed as well.Overall its 45% out of 100 or 4.5 out of 10. Its a really poor attempt at the cartel genre along the Mexican/US border. Dull writing, boring story......so basic and nothing new whatsoever.

There, it had to be said. Liam Neeson with a gun, to be more specific. A dusty, grizzled war veteran. A trusty dog. The evil Mexican drug cartel. A barb-wired border wall. A sack of money. A doe-eyed kid. An American flag waving in the desert wind.

And yet, it doesn't play by the set out cookie cutter pattern. The old coot never resorts to any macho posturing, instead he reluctantly slips into dangerous waters as circumstances dictate. It's a bit of an acting transformation for an actor who clearly owns some chops, but has been saddled with his current robotic action hero stereotype.The plot may be pedantic dumb, but who needs smart when Neeson is commanding the screen, and we have the classic good guy vs. The bad guys showdown with sides oh so easy to take.Next up: the comedy we all know thespian Liam has deep within his stone cold soul.hipCRANK.",The Marksman

Other than his portrayal, the incoherent script, and poor acting took a rare 2021 movie and turned it into barely better than direct-to-DVD fare.The plot is full of holes. Among the more egregious is the idea that someone supposedly world wise would continue to use his credit card to lay a breadcrumb trail to allow a known enemy to follow him halfway across the country. Even when direct evidence of this was clear, the actions never changed.And while the corruption of many law enforcement officials in Mexico is a known reality, especially with cooperation with the drug cartels there, the notion that this corruption has transferred itself north of the border is a reach.One more contentious issue with the plot is that a retired Marine would find himself bankrupted by the medical bills of a family member. Didn't this ex-Marine have himself medical care provided by the military? It may not pay for all the bills, but it pays for the vast majority of them, more than enough to keep someone from being bankrupted by medical costs. That sort of contrivance would have played much better had it been used for a civilian, vice a retired Marine.One final beef is that no matter what one thinks of the US government, and in particular the US Border Patrol, having known that the boy's mother was murdered by cartel thugs, there is no way this kid would have been sent back to Mexico immediately, given the very clear threat against him.The problem with such a lazy script is seeing so many other more interesting and complex plot options left on the floor, with this ball of wax deemed the best movie candidate.Combine it with other more or less pedestrian production qualities, and the movie really has one thing going for it -- an A-list actor who tried his best, but was still unable to make this pig look pretty.",The Marksman

With action man, Liam Neeson, proving you're never too old to rock'n'roll, but you might be pushing it at 68 in this genre.
Still more power to him.
I hope i'm still reviewing movies at his age.
In the words of Elvis Costello, my aim is true.
And so is Liam's as a former Vietnam Veteran with not one, but two tours of duty as a God Damn US Marine...he mentions it occasionally plus the ever present tattoo on his forearm is a giveaway.
He's pretty handy with a repeat action rifle and with just one lesson from him you too can become a sharp shooter just ask the Mexican kid.
This movie could be the reason Trump wanted to build a real fence on the border between Mexico and the good ol' US of A.
Instead all they have is rabbit proof wire construction that couldn't even keep out a Mexican Single Mum and her young son, let alone the Drug Cartels foot soldiers.
This action, thriller, road movie is directed by Roberto Lorenz who has a strong background as a movie Producer for this class of film.
Basically Liam is a rancher on the Arizona border who finds himself baby sitting a young Mexican boy from cartel assassins intent on making sure he doesn't get to sing in a High School Musical.
Despite the movie being full of goofs and huge oversights like: burning cartel money instead of using it to avoid an online paper trail that will inevitably lead them straight to the boys on the run in the pick up truck that should be peppered with bullet holes.
Plus everyone seemingly has an endless supply of rounds and every cop and border patrol is on the cartel pay roll.
Push all that aside and you've got an entertaining nearly 2 hours shoot em up.
The moral of this story is we've all got choices to make in this life, so make sure you choose the right path and you might not have to share a burger with a crusty old cattle farmer who's wife has died, his stock are worthless and the bank is foreclosing on his mortgage.

His performance is good as another tortured soul haunted by the loss of his wife and potential loss of his farm. True, the story is formulaic, but the movie is eminently watchable and the digital cinematography is excellent (especially evident towards the end of the film). I reserve ratings 4 and below for movies that are technically incompetent or completely incoherent, which this movie is certainly is NOT.

I'm now beginning to understand why so many people in the US are demanding for a wall to be built.As for the movie itself, it's another Neeson style movie where he's on a mission. The difference,...this time he's the one being hunted, rather than doing the hunting. The movie showed enough pace to keep me somewhat interested. But it also frustrated me on how (sometimes) clueless and bad luck Neeson's character was having, which kept providing enough clues for the bad guys to continually track where he's heading.I guess if it weren't for these blunders, the movie would be less dramatic.SUMMARY:

They didn't really show that he was some kind of expert shot or had a career in it or anything, so it really had nothing to do with this movie. Also, there so many logical issues with this film that I couldn't take it seriously. Right from the beginning, when the mother and her son were running from the cartel, they got to the other side while the killers were right behind them, but when they run into Liam they don't scream out that the killers are 3 seconds away so they all just stand there talking! Makes no sense. Then they go thru all the trouble to explain how Liam is losing his ranch, but then after that it has nothing to do with the story. And the cartel can track him but the US authorities can't! And neither the cartel or the US authorities thought about the fact they were probably going to the kid's nearest relatives - duh. Also, even though Liam paid the hotel in cash, the cartel still tracked him to that hotel! The logic issues go on and on. And then the ending - what ending?

Was that on purpose to make him so stupid? It is mind-boggling. You mean, he wasn't smart enough to rent a car? Let's get this straight. He has a Mexican drug cartel chasing him. They have ID'd his truck. His truck is full of bullet holes. But he doesn't know enough to ditch the vehicle. Not only that, but he gets drunk and passes out in a truck, leaving the kid alone in the bar. The kid the cartel is trying to kill. So he's trying to save the kid but does that? There isn't a single person on earth in this situation who would make the decisions made by this leading character. The movie is plodding and boring.

Now we just get a rightful man that tries to do a good thing for this boy. The boy also gives a solid performance and their chemistry makes the predictable story a lot better. The only thing that really bothered me was the antagonist. His original goal doesn't really make sense. He gets way too much screen time for such an uninteresting character and would have worked just as well with half of the scenes. The main problem however, is that there is nothing new. Everything in this movie is something we've seen before in one shape or another. The movie doesn't try to bring anything new to the genre and that makes it very predictable and even at times a bit boring.

In this film he just went on autopilot after the opening scene, and the other actors look like they're completely asleep. Out of all the auxiliary characters, the kid's mother, the girl at the gas station and the main villain's driver emote the most. Those are barely even speaking roles.It's hard to even call this a movie, since there is barely any plot to the whole thing. Most of the setups go nowhere. Neeson's relationship to his cop friend ends up being pointless filler, his house is burned down after he already chose to leave, he loses his rifle at one scene only to immediately buy another in a scene later. Hardly anything in the film is of consequence. It's basically Neeson and the kid, who share absolutely no chemistry, on a bland road trip and the bad guys slowly gaining on them, because they track his credit card usage.There is no ticking clock element, no hard choices to make by any of the characters, nothing of consequence. Add to this the fact that the film has barely any score and only two action scenes, one of which consists of guys walking slowly before being shot through a scope - off screen.The film feels like it's trying to make a point about the border, but I can't even make out what it is. Farmers shouldn't report illegals, because the cartels may be after them? But at the same time the official border checkpoints are corrupt and the cartels just pass through? Buying an unregistered gun is good? All of these scenes felt tacked on and again have no bearing on the main plot.Rarely have I seen a script with so little thought put into it.

The action scenes were a disappointment, except for only one scene where neeson makes a car flip over. The movie is slow and boring and the ending is the cherry on top, with liam neeson basically dying (tho wikipedia says ""unconscious"" but stupid nonetheless how he didnt even call 911 right away and go to the hospital. Its unrealistic that the mexican cartel would have its hands on every police/hospital in the U. S. and he couldhv easily gotten help right after the ""big fight"" at the end.) besides, if the cartel is so powerful with its hands stretched out so wide then how does he know its safe for miguel once he is with his aunt in chicago?? Cant the cartel easily find him there if they are that determined to find miguel? I guess since the boss guy died theres less danger of that, but this movie had poor writing nonetheless.

202,joshuarenealvarez,The Marksman (2021),6,22 February 2021,"The Marksman is an action-thriller co-written
and directed by Robert Lorenz. He is best known
for his collaborations with Clint Eastwood as assistant director and producer in iconic films such as Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River and American Sniper. This is his second feature-length film to date. The plot follows a former marine-turned-rancher named Jim Hanson (Liam Neeson) who stumbles upon Rosa and Miguel, a mother and a son who are being hunted by cartel assassins along the Arizona-Mexican border. Thus he brings it on himself
to stage an intervention. The narrative is reminiscent
to Road to Perdition and Logan where the titular
character forms an eventual bond with a youth in danger.But I would recommend that you watch those films
instead as you will receive far more satisfaction as opposed to The Marksman which is a pretty forgettable film,
in my opinion. The storyline is straightforward, predictable, and as clichéd as it sounds. It contained recycled material that we've witnessed over the years and it's the reason why
I would not advise anyone to consume their precious time with this film. Only if you are an avid follower of Liam Neeson's filmography and you personally enjoy seeing him in these action-fueled roles which is still astonishing to me given his age. The actor clearly has more fight in him before he decides to hang up the boxing gloves.He was only the benefactor for this experience as the
film lacks many redeeming qualities. Especially with the selling point for this film which is the relationship between Jim Hansen and Miguel. I didn't fully accept it as their characters weren't fleshed out enough, and that same issue contributed to my dissatisfaction with the supporting cast members as well as their uninspiring performances.This isn't the worst of film of the new year.But it isn't an exceptional one by any means.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

One of the reviewers here wrote ""this is by no means an exceptional movie"". This should get the Understatement of the Year award. Cliched script, plodding direction, bad acting: Katheryn Winnick, in a pointless bit part, was the only female presence of any note and most of her acting was done by her low-cut tops (which every self-respecting State police woman wears as standard issue). Mr. Neeson's character looked genuinely tired and frustrated with his life, but this did not require any acting on his part, the script took care of it. Everybody else looked like they were doing a chore. Dialogue was awful and seemed like teased with pliers. Action was sparse and not entertaining, and the chemistry between the lone old man and the boy non-existent. And then, there were the plot holes... Oh my, where does one begin: seasoned cartel enforcers walk casually uncovered on open fields knowing that may be targeted through a rifle scope. A man shot and stabbed several times can, of course, typically drive for several miles afterwards. Nobody even bats an eyelid when a person covered in blood marks gets on a public bus staggering. One can go on.Shame for Liam, really, who has given us some very decent and entertaining movies, even late in his career.

Are you looking for a movie that tells a story which has no basis in reality and only exists as a piggyback to Liam Nieson's career? Hope so!I'm a huge Liam Nieson fan. Unfortunately, he seemingly will forever be in ""Taken"" remakes of various varieties. Even worse, BAD Taken remakes with terrible plots. Well, if you've found this review, you've also found 'The Marksman' (or, Taken 10).Another unfortunate outcome of this movie is the predictable acting. Liam Nieson plays the role which they hired him and in true fashion, he does it very well. But, we've seen this role about a million times now. I like Katheryn Winnick as an actress and would like to see her in more films. However, like Nieson, her acting chops can't fill the gap of a boring, pointless character who has no real purpose. Waste of talent IMO. And, I think that's the underlying story here = BORING characters and predictable Hollywood plots.This story feels recycled and we've seen this one over and over again. Even worse, it has no basis in reality. The story is nonsensical and feels like Hollywoods take on what they THINK happens at the border. Well, if you can imagine how uninformed they are regarding average ordinary life... you can imagine their take on the border situation.In summary, if this film had any other starring actor other than Liam Nieson, it would have been on Lifetime or some obscure cable channel. Waste of good acting talent. Waste of good West Texas scenery. Waste of your time. If you like Nieson, go see Cold Pursuit.

267,darangulafilm,THE MARKSMAN. WORTH A LOOK.,8,21 January 2021,"Other reviewers have given the makers of this screen story a bit of an undeserved caning.Is it genre-fare written to an apparent familiar formula? Yes. There is a practical limit to how many stories can be really original any more.The story backbone has been told in many forms before and being a writer, I had a fair clue how it was going to conclude. The characters were drawn well by their respective actors.Was the story well executed? Yes I think it was. It was also raised beyond slam, bamm and drink the bourbon. Any more detail and I will be publishing spoilers.Contrary to the genre, the young character wass written without smart backanswers, emotional hystrionics and generally unlikeable behaviour towards adults.The writers wisely avoided the cliche of victim aggression and acting out towards the rescuer in some sort of emotional and revelationary rehook into a new story chapter. That has been overdone so much over the years as to be maukish.The young actor gives a surprisingly restrained performance, maybe influenced by Liam Neeson or carefully directed or both.There were opportunities in the story for a director to be tempted into a few clammy cliches which were thankfully avoided.The locations were not recognisable from other movies so that was a refreshing change.With the music underscore, I was quite impressed. Part of the head and tail bookends seem to be homage to two other films from the 80s and 90s in their arrangement and tone colours. However they were entirely original and skillfully woven.The underscore through the film does not draw attention and may have been even left absent for all I know. That is when underscores work best. No musical distractions were necessary anywhere to ""save"" the film. That speaks for the work done by the writer and director more so than folk may realise.If you have the opportunity to see the film in a cinema, I recommend you do so.",The Marksman
268,Claimant,Why Liam Neeson?,4,29 September 2021,I really like Liam Neeson but I am disappointed to see him in a movie like this. Movie script is very poor. Some scenes are really nonsense. No action. The movie doesn't even deserve its title. It is just a disappointment.,The Marksman
269,Josiah23,"As with most action movies made today, it carries the scent of loftier ambitions",10,19 January 2021,"I think there are several compelling factors about this movie that need to be pointed out, if they haven't already been done so. Number one, some fresh takes on some old themes. What I liked most among these was the soldier mentality and code of honor exhibited by both the main villain and the hero, the fact that they both have something in common... or, at least, it is perceived that way. The fact that the villain keeps one of Henson's military medals, offering it up to him in the end, relinquishing his envy for the man and in return, gaining a little bit of respect... enough to have earned a 'soldier's choice' (how you die).
The young boy with the deep soul. The first thing we learn about him is that his ambitions in love give him a kind of divine confidence and the ability to see beauty anywhere (even from a sunlit gummy bear). He understands his mother's death and is able to process it in such a way that guides Liam Née son's character. After the death of the dog, the trip to the church to pay respects to Miguel's mother, was a much needed reprieve in the storyline and one you don't often find in this type of action-thriller.
I thought this movie was well blended with action and drama. Enough action to create suspense, enough drama to keep your attention. Overall, I would give it ten stars because I would like to see more movies like this.",The Marksman

271,mellonmationsyt,Severely dissapointing,5,18 March 2021,"I should preface this review by saying I saw this movie in theaters, with my mom who said it would be a good movie and people were saying it was good. The way it was described was misleading, the trailer made some very questionable choices so walking into the theatre I went in completely impartial, I wasn't expecting good I wasn't expecting bad. The film is extremely mediocre and safe, you don't learn anything or come away with a different point of view, which is what the film intended. The frame rate was extremely high and while that sounds like a good thing it was genuinely nauseating. It felt like a rollercoaster with how everything moved and happened. While the cinematography was great the story wasn't. The Villans make unreasonable choices that drive the plot. While at the end there's a decent character arc for the main villain, the hero doesn't. Most characters don't really change and the morale and character traits feel very forced. The film seems somewhat political and while that's not necessarily a bad thing or a film killer it wants to change the opinion of boarder control activists. It boarder line shoves the message down your throat. If your a film buff you may have noticed the plot isn't original, it's leon: the professional. The plot is very similar except for the ""on the run"" aspect of the film, while I don't think it's bad for it to take a little inspiration it doesn't feel original at all. Genuinely it's not as good as I've heard people call it, it's an overbudgeted, safe, unoriginal movie. The characters lack personality and plot feels unnecessary. Good background noise.",The Marksman

The clash at the border seemed so overly obvious that it was setting up the movie that it was almost laughable. To think that someone speeding away from a shootout with the Cartel wouldn't look in his rear view mirror even once was just dumb and then to believe that killing the bad guys brother (who barely had a reaction when he found out he was dead) was the reason the Cartel is chasing a little boy and an older man across the US. Liam, of course was great and I enjoyed a bit of it, but in the end, if they were trying to gain my sympathy for the cartel soldier who killed a teenage girl and a dog, they fell very short. There was no possibility of a redemption arc for him.No matter what, Liam always brings his A game and I agree with someone else's review where they compared him to Clint Eastwood.

It was predictable and painfully cliche. Nothing was explained in any basic detail and characters decision making was ridiculous at times. The little kid ""surprisingly"" knowing english was so predicable and lame I almost quit watching after that scene. Being that fluent and without an accent made it so much worse. How lazy of script could you make this film?The bad guy might have actually been the worse character in the film.

Trite characters, a plot that makes oatmeal seem spicy and exotic, a very obviously over-pushed central message, all to the tune of limp acting from one and all.

385,canchonhot,DONT WATCH THE MOVIE,1,24 June 2021,The movie was sooo bad I'm on the cinema right ow writing a review so anyone has to go through this ever again. SPOILER ALERT: worst movie ever done do not watch 😡😡😡😡😡,The Marksman
386,Derekwares,Marksman who apparently has never handled a gun.,3,30 October 2021,"Very predictable. Jacob Perez, who plays the kid, did a wonderful job and saved my score from being a 1 star. It's called ""The Marksman"", but doesn't really have much to do with Liam Neeson being a ""Marksman"". In fact it's very cringe worthy to watch him handle a gun in the movie. From slapping the trigger wildly, to inadvertently pointing his pistol at the kid a number of times, and in general performing poor gun handling/safety. Any actor that will be using a gun, prop or otherwise, should go through at least some gun safety/handling training. You want me to believe your a marksman, you better hold your gun like a marksman, aim down sights like a marksman, pull the trigger like a marksman. Maybe if Alec Baldwin knew how to check if a gun was loaded he wouldn't have murdered that poor woman. Some producers have no business making movies involving guns.",The Marksman
387,ctaylor222,Decent,6,5 November 2021,"So many opportunities to kill the big boss, but he chooses to kill all the nobodys first. Needed for the final speech I reckon.Decent film. Total nonsense. But I'd watch ten thousand more like it.",The Marksman
388,shep2016,They kill the dog.,1,21 June 2021,"Save your time, they kill the dog. Total party foul. Also, probably the worst acting I've seen from Liam Neeson.",The Marksman
389,berserker05,Deserved,3,19 May 2021,Just for kill the dog... really very bad writted...,The Marksman
390,jacob-malmskov,Took me 3 nights to get to the end...,2,13 October 2021,... of this very poor movie. I would say it ranks as a top 3 of all time worst for me. Love Liam but with the corny lines and poor directing even he is helpless.Only positive is that from here things can only improve.,The Marksman
391,bradnelson1989,A movie about an anti gun guy who carries guns,1,13 May 2021,Well this washed up now b-list actor has yet again made another movie with the same premise. The script sucks and the acting is complete crap. Stop hating on guns Liam you use them to make a living.,The Marksman
392,robdelage,Waste of time,1,17 August 2021,"Liam Neeson will make any movie now, especially ones with really predictable plots. This movie is for sure the worst movie he's been in.",The Marksman
393,tarun_john,This can't be real,4,19 April 2021,"This is my first time writing a movie review, because I just had to. Character building is ok, pace of the movie is ok, story is predictable, but the execution is the worst. Take for instance, at the end of the movie Liam is shooting a rifle with a scope, and his face is far away from the scope, and he has both eyes open - & the name of the movie is called Marksman. I can't 😂😂😂",The Marksman
394,arklein328,Gripping and Emotional,10,18 May 2021,"The Marksman is a gripping movie, and not only in the ways the genre expects of it. Sure, it is suspenseful and exciting, but it also grabs the audience in emotional ways that are completely unexpected and that take this thriller to the next level. Too often ""action"" movies are so concerned with the suspense and thrill of it that they forget to put the same energy-if not more-into the story and the characters. But The Marksman knows that emotion is the key to genuine suspense. If we have an emotional connection to these characters, we will care what happens to them. The movie uses that to its advantage, and really successfully. The action truly means something here-the stakes feel real, and they feel personal.But it's not just the action or the life-or-death stakes that pack the punches. It's the quieter moments. The acting really sells these smaller scenes. Liam Neeson's work is so subtle, and yet he conveys so much emotion that it's clear exactly what he's thinking and feeling in every scene-even if it's just a small heartbreaking moment by himself (and there are many).Overall, The Marksman provides a captivating experience for the audience in more ways than the average viewer might expect-be prepared to get emotional. (I might also suggest having a palate-cleansing comedy lined up for afterward.)",The Marksman
395,smithhugh759,Heart & Suspense,9,13 February 2021,"Absolutely great, had so much fun with this. Neeson perfectly fits into his character and works extremely well with the young lead, with both of them providing some amazing heartfelt moments in between the incredible action sequences. So glad I was finally able to see something in the theater again, and I'm so glad it was this film.",The Marksman
396,noevivesmadriz,Animal cruelty in this movie,3,16 September 2021,The movie was good so far until they started to kill animals.,The Marksman
397,pynerb,This is a very entertaining movie!,10,12 February 2021,"The Marksmam is a very entertaining movie! Liam Neeson plays an extremely likable character one that you are pulling for right from the start! The same goes for the boy that he is protecting! I feel that I also learned about how things work on the Arizona-Mexico border which I also felt was worthwhile! This movie is good and there is definitely some action in there too!

398,frankrw,Honestly. Slow. Disappointed,6,8 June 2021,Movie was slow. To be honest. Not Neeson's better roles. Predictable plot and scenes. Two unexplained situations.WARNING SPOILER!!How did the cartel locate the motel that Jim and Miguel were staying at? They specifically made a point to show Jim realize he should not use his credit card. So the cartel just randomly picked the right motel? Lame.And Hernando took a very uncharacteristic u-turn to show Jim respect by giving back his medal. He was obviously devoted to the cartel and would never have backed down as long as he was alive.And they should have at least given Miguel a hotdog at the end. I was expecting it!,The Marksman

Even if they're done a little wrong. Listen your Grandfathers, hell your fathers wanted to be him. Your Grandmothers wanted to do other stuff with him.! LolSecond: Am I the only guy that grew up with a Dad that watched westerns 24/7? It is very possible. Lol
But needless to say I grew up on westerns, and this is a good modern day western.Third: Open your mind watch movies, be a movie connoisseur. A decent movie is a decent movie. This movie hits the mark it was trying to hit. Hell it might even do better than it wanted to.",The Marksman

402,tjdoubek,Perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever see,1,18 June 2021,"Nothing good. The story was boring and predictable. I can't imagine who read the script and thought it was worth making this film. The acting was bland across the board. I kept watching, thinking that something unexpected would happen. I was hoping that Katheryn Winnick would turn into Lagertha and kill Liam Neeson. Just terrible.",The Marksman
403,pamela-austria,Modern Western,10,6 February 2021,This film is a modern western with a familiar feel of Clint Eastwood films of yore. It's character driven and focuses on actual relationships rather than stereotypes or current political issues. Even the villain is someone you can sympathize with! The pacing felt great and the acting natural. So much better than the shoot 'em up typical action films.,The Marksman
404,yakimatt,Just okay,6,26 June 2021,I'll watch Liam Neeson in just about anything and he really carries the movie. I thought the production quality was a little low and the pace of the movie was on the slow side.,The Marksman
405,wittmonk,Anything but Formulaic,10,23 January 2021,"I found myself surprised at every turn. Whenever the movie made me feel like I might be able to predict what was going to happen next, it subverted my expectations. Well done!",The Marksman
406,stellarockc-57448,Please STOP Liam...,2,7 February 2021,"This movie is so predictable and to be quite honest...horrible. The director must have taken this project out of boredom because it shows in every frame, the movie could have been made in thirty minutes if the dull boring scenes had been removed and the predictable and unrealistic scenes had been combined to the conclusion that we knew was coming. Regrettably, we opted to see this as our second choice because our preferred showing was near full and we opted to be safe and not take on the crowded theater ...we made a bad decision! Liam, you deserve better and please don't do it just for the money anymore.",The Marksman
