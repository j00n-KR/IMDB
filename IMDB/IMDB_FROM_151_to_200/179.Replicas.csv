0,TheLittleSongbird,Obsessive replication,3,28 February 2019,"'Replicas' was yet another example of a film where an excellent, promising idea is enough to draw anybody right in. Also appreciate sci-fi with a touch of thriller and do not mind films made on a modest to low budget. Despite what some of my reviews seem to indicate otherwise, namely due to seeing too many of those that don't show much or any signs of effort. Am no fan of Keanu Reeves, but don't hate him as much as others do. He has given the odd above serviceable performance when the material allows, but too many of his films betray his limitations.Very like what 'Replicas' does. It is very frustrating when a film does nothing with good potential or botches an idea that could easily have worked, regardless of what the budget is, and there are many of those around. 'Replicas' does this and is one of the most disappointing recent examples for me. An example of a film that had one of the best ideas for any film seen recently, one that could have made for an intelligent, tense and interesting film, yet was none of those things and ended up being ridiculous and dull. Which does leave me somewhat annoyed.What stops 'Replicas' from getting a lower rating from me, being somebody who always strives to see the good in everything (as well as pointing out things that could have been better in other above average and more films/television series/dramas/episodes/productions), is the production values. Here the production values, considering the budget, were really quite good, being remarkably slick and atmospheric with no real signs of choppiness.Also thought the music avoided being intrusive, repetitive or monotonous. It is not exceptional and doesn't stay in the mind forever but it was at least tolerable and fitted rather than worked against.Everything else on the other hand doesn't work...at all. And it is difficult knowing when to start with the criticisms. Do have to completely concur with those criticising the acting and script, both elements were never more than risible. Reeves' limitations have not been this obvious in quite some time, while nobody else seems remotely interested in their roles and give lifeless at best performances. Alice Eve in particular, showing the emotions of a robot. The characters though do have nothing to them, no depth or personality and found myself frequently bored and annoyed by them as their behaviour became increasingly stupid (a bugbear of mine and committed a lot). The script was written by somebody with very little prior experience and that comes through loud and clear, everything sounded so forced, so unnatural and as soggy as particularly wet cucumber sandwiches which are inedible in my mind.The story is an absolute mess. It doesn't even start off well, from the start we are hit by poor acting, dialogue and characters getting worse all the time. The first half is ridiculous and causes unintentional laughter, and there is a feeling that the concept was rather over-ambitious because there is a lot of convolution, loose ends and lack of sense and logic as a result of severely under-explaining everything. The second half includes thriller elements that are anything but thrilling and has no tension or suspense, with the pace getting more and more tedious and the confusion and stupidity rises to fever pitch. To add insult to injury, there is an attempt at a third act reveal that was not a surprise at all and enough to make one want to hit their heads on a wall in frustration at having their intelligence insulted. Then the film ends on a rather pat and too easily resolved note. Inexperience shows in the direction too.Concluding, disappointingly weak for something that had such great potential to work and should have done. 3/10",Replicas
1,Leofwine_draca,"Interesting, until it becomes a different movie",5,24 October 2019,"REPLICAS is a sci-fi drama starring Keanu Reeves as a family man and cutting edge scientist forced into extreme action when he loses his entire family in a car accident. The setup is highly predictable, but the story is handled in a surprisingly sensitive manner, at least for the first two thirds of the running time. We're in dark, moral dilemma territory here, with Reeves convincing as a man pushed to the edge and an interesting look at the rights and wrongs of the action he takes. What's a shame, then, is that the last third becomes a different film entirely, a routine action thriller with so-so CGI effects. It's like they're not allowed to have any moral darkness in the Reeves character, so bring in a stock villain instead, and the film loses something as a result.",Replicas
2,SnoopyStyle,flawed sci-fi,5,8 January 2019,"Will Foster (Keanu Reeves) and Ed (Thomas Middleditch) work under Jones (John Ortiz) in an experimental bio company developing a way to download the human mind. They try to download a dead man into a robot and fail. Will gets into a car accident which kills his family. With Ed's help and three stolen pods, he decides to resurrect his wife Mona (Alice Eve), daughter Sophie (Emily Alyn Lind), and son Matt (Emjay Anthony). He doesn't have a pod for his daughter Zoe and he has to erase her from their memories.This is a flawed sci-fi story. The science of the downloading needs some more exposition and seems contradictory. It's a lot of flash and waving of the hand to excuse any inconsistencies. Downloading into a robot and into a clone seems like completely different technologies. The only part I truly like is hiding their deaths from their friends. I expected the movie to get pass the techno babble and get to them trying to re-enter society. It never gets pass the sci-fi complications. I'm not sure if anybody is doing things logically because I don't understand the details of the science. This needs a few more passes with a good script doctor.",Replicas

The experiment does not work and the body is rejected by the donors, and the manager Jones (John Ortiz) is pressing Will telling that the government will shut down the experiment. While traveling with his family to Ed´s boat in a stormy night, Will has a car accident on the road and his beloved wife Mona (Alice Eve) and their three children die. Will calls Ed and convinces him to develop clones of his family members to transfer their memories. They have only four pods and the youngest daughter is sacrificed. Now Will needs to make his experiment work since he will not have a second chance.""Replicas"" is a flawed but highly entertaining sci-fi thriller.

5,kosmasp,Life after death,6,5 July 2020,"What are we? What is our essence? And what can be done with our ""being"" after we die? A lot of questions that may not be easy to answer - and this is not here to answer all those questions. It is here to entertain more than be a definitive guide to anything.While it sort of achieves that, it is also quite simple in nature. The beginning drags itself with an introduction and an explanatory talk by Keanus character to people who already should know what they are doing and why they are there. Of course Keanu says that to give the viewer context and to explain it to us. But even if you didn't read what the movie is about, it is unnecessary. You'll be able to catch the drift.Anyway the movie is decent, especially if you are into Science Fiction. Performances are ok too ... but if you feel there could have been more, you are not so wrong - no pun intended",Replicas

I was sure I had seen this before, but I was wrong, bigger sci fi enthusiasts will I'm sure know the film I mean, where a woman dies, and is brought back by her husband.Plot holes, plot holes galore, maybe the script editor had a day off, at times it is quite laughable.The concept is quite nice, but the realisation want perhaps the best, at times the acting seemed a little bit off, even Keanu himself.Some nice special effects, but not enough to save the movie. 5/10.",Replicas
7,paul_haakonsen,Enjoyable sci-fi thriller...,6,3 April 2021,"I hadn't even heard about this 2018 movie titled ""Replicas"". I stumbled upon it and saw the cover briefly, thinking that was Keanu Reeves, so I picked it up to further investigate. And true enough, it was him. So of course I managed to find the time to sit down and watch this sci-fi thriller.And sure, while this movie's storyline is a bit out there and outside the realms of what is realistically conceivable, it does make for some good old fashioned sci-fi thriller entertainment. And I mean that in a good way. Because while ""Replicas"" does attempt with jabs at science and being all intellectual and all, it is all meant for entertainment purposes. So just brush aside anything that would make you put the movie up against what is actually realistically possible and within scientific grasp, and just enjoy the movie for what it is.The storyline is pretty straight forward and writers Chad St. John and Stephen Hamel does manage to churn out a storyline that picks up the viewers and take them on a slightly futuristic thrill ride of cloning and family love.While ""Replicas"" is by no means a milestone in the career of Keanu Reeves, it is a noteworthy movie though, because it does offer more than just mindless entertainment, given the underlaying morale issues and dilemmas that the storyline presents.Visually then ""Replicas"" is good. Not a movie that relies too heavily on special effects. But those that were in the movie were nice to look at and pulled off quite well, serving the movie well in its favor.""Replicas"" is an entertaining movie for what it is. But it is hardly a movie that has the contents to support more than a single viewing though. I am rating ""Replicas"", from director Jeffrey Nachmanoff, a six out of ten stars. If you have the chance to sit down to watch it, do so. Just don't expect it to be a movie that is overly realistic.",Replicas

He quickly sets about using the technology and know-how from his lab to try to resurrect them as clones but it isn't quite the secret he thought it was, and soon all are being chased down... It looks like it could all have been done in a week; the dialogue is stilted - as are the performances, especially from John Ortiz (""Jones"") and Reeves who really does seem to be just going through the motions. It's all a bit disappointing, really - could have made much more from quite a decent premiss.",Replicas
9,zardoz-13,Abysmal At Best,3,22 January 2019,"When he isn't making entertaining movies like ""The Matrix,"" ""Speed,"" ""The Devil's Advocate,"" ""Point Break,"" ""Constantine,"" ""Street Kings,"" ""River's Edge,"" and those ""John Wick"" movies, Keanu Reeves occupies himself with movies so marginal they head straight to home video. Anybody seen ""Exposed"" (2016), ""The Whole Truth"" (2016) ""Siberia"" (2018), and/or ""Destination Wedding"" (2018)? Surprisingly, ""Traitor"" director Jeffrey Nachmanoff's half-baked, sci-fi/crime hybrid ""Replicas"" (* OUT OF ****), landed in theaters! Clearly, with all its lapses of logic as well as its countless plot holes, ""Replicas"" should have missed theaters. Imagine Keanu Reeves cast as a 'mad scientist,' and you'll have the gist of this superficial, second-rate, B-movie thriller. A gifted neuroscientist watches his wife and three children die tragically in an auto accident. Taking his cues from Dr. Frankenstein, our grief-stricken protagonist turns a blind eye to ethics. Not only does he dare to clone his family, but he also transplants their brains into those clones! Clearly, this far-fetched, but lukewarm melodrama about human cloning and memory implantation bristles with pseudo-scientific dialogue. Something about this movie lensed on location in Puerto Rico bothered me, because it was made before Hurricane Marie struck. ""Replicas"" doesn't do double-duty as a scenic vacation travelogue. Rarely are we shown landmarks of distinction. Indeed, it could have been shot in Florida, and nobody would have known otherwise. Incidentally, the $30-million budgeted ""Replicas"" languished on the shelf for two years. Apparently, the only reason it saw the light of day was Entertainment Studios paid a cool $4-million for it. Despite its upbeat ending, Nachmanoff and ""Peppermint"" scenarist Chad St. John, working from an original idea by Stephen Hamel-Keanu's partner at Company Films, have fashioned a wannabe Mike Crichton science project. Interestingly, Reeves delivers a conscientious, straight-forward performance as the grieving scientist who overlooks the myriad obstacles involved in concealing the deaths in his family from the outside world. Earlier movies like ""Replicas"" include ""Godsend"" (2004) about a father who wanted his deceased son brought back to life, ""The Island"" (2009), where clones were confined offshore, and ""The Sixth Day"" (2000) where the hero clones himself. Meaning, there's nothing new about the premise.Dr. William Foster (Keanu Reeves of ""Dangerous Liaisons"") conducts amoral biomedical research for a privately-owned company, Bionyne Industries, with its headquarters in Puerto Rico. Foster has been struggling to implant the memories of a human being into a robot. Foster's colleague and close friend Ed Whittle (Thomas Middleditch of ""The Campaign"") assists him with this research. Ed provides the cloning expertise. When ""Replicas"" opens, Foster transfers the mind of a dead soldier into an ""I, Robot"" like android. Initially, the experiment shows signs of promise. However, the human brain rejects its robotic body and goes berserk. Foster pulls the plug on it. Foster's boss, Mr. Jones (John Ortiz of ""Kong: Skull Island""), warns him that he must achieve positive results, or Bionyne will shut them down permanently. All of this occurs during the Christmas holidays, when Foster plans to take his wife, Mona (Alice Eve of ""Men in Black 3""), and their three children: oldest daughter Sophie (Emily Alyn Lind), next-to-oldest Matt (Emjay Anthony), and youngest daughter Zoe (Aria Lyric Leabu), on an ocean cruise. The night they leave for the harbor, a torrential storm swamps them. Narrowly, they avoid a head-on collision with a tractor-trailer. Without warning, a tree plunges through the front windshield and impales Mona through the chest like a pin stuck into a lab specimen. Careening off the road, Foster plows into a pond. His children drown before he can rescue them. Rather than calling for an ambulance, Foster contacts his buddy Ed, and the two decide to attempt the impossible. Secretly, they appropriate lots of high-tech Bionyne equipment without permission. Foster extracts each's consciousness and stores them, while Ed assembles three clone incubation pods. Sadly, Foster realizes he will only be able to restore his wife and his oldest children. He removes all traces of Zoe from their home. Seventeen days elapse, and the clones emerge, virtually identical in physical resemblance. Foster implants their minds into the clones. During those seventeen days, Foster never realized to his chagrin that concealing the death of his family could have jeopardized his plans. Essentially, he had to maintain a steady stream of social media data, so nobody would suspect that Mona, Sophie, and Matt were dead. Afterward, Eve, Sophie, and Matt awaken none the worse for wear. Interestingly, reconciles his lack of success in the lab with his success in cloning his family. Meanwhile, poor Ed must dispose of their corpses. Hovering suspiciously around Foster, Mr. Jones reminds him about the absolute critical need for success. Abruptly, Foster cancels the second mind transfer. Instead, he decides to use himself as a guinea pig, hiding in a toilet stall, enduring the torture, so he can be certain that his brain will accept the robot.Rampant lapses in logic and plot holes sabotage ""Replicas."" Initially, after they install the clone incubation pods in Foster's basement, Ed warns William that the power can never blink or fatal consequences will follow. Sneaking around his neighborhood, Foster steals every car battery, and uses them to maintain a constant source of power! The baffled local constabulary question Foster about this bizarre theft, but he claims to know nothing. Meantime, Foster and Ed take it for granted that the Bionyne brass, particularly Mr. Jones, won't discover their missing inventory. Most of the scientific shenanigans here amount to utter hokum. Indeed, ""Replicas"" seems like it would have fared better as a comedy of errors. ""The Wrap"" classified ""Replicas"" as ""the worst wide-release box office opening of his career."" ""Business Insider"" called it ""the worst opening weekend for any Reeves movie that has opened on at least 2,000 screens."" The film grossed a feeble $3-million during its first week in release. Mind you, ""Replicas"" doesn't look like it will enjoy a long theatrical release, so you had better snap to it or wait for Redbox. For the record, ""Replicas"" lasted for a week in Columbus, with about 20 tickets sold.",Replicas
10,view_and_review,Movie was D.O.A.,2,13 January 2019,"This movie was so bad. Its first and primary problem was that it thoroughly lacked originality. There wasn't a single original idea throughout the movie. If you're not going to be original then you truly need to give a creative spin to the borrowed concept. As I was watching I saw Minority Report, The Sixth Day, Self/less, Chappie, Ex-Machina, iRobot, and sooooo many other movies that dealt with cloning, transferring consciousness, and other hi tech stuff.The unoriginality, the slow moving plot, the poor writing, and Keanu Reeves all made this movie unbearable. Keanu has put out some good movies but when he's in a bad movie it only amplifies his inability to act. Keanu is great as a Neo or a John Wick; horrible as Bill Foster (the main character of this movie, not to be confused with Dr. Bill Foster aka Goliath of Marvel who appeared in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" played by Laurence Fishburne). The movie was forced and had to make huge assumptions, gloss over gaping holes, and really defy logic in order to advance the plot. Honestly, it should have been a non-starter.This movie was D.O.A. Bill Foster tries to imprint the consciousness of a dead soldier onto a robot number 345. He fails to make the consciousness accept the new vessel it's been dumped into--then come the threats of being shutdown. Necessity is the mother of invention. The threat of a shutdown coupled with a tragic accident that kills his entire family kick Bill Foster's genius juices into gear and gave us the steaming pile called a movie.Bill Foster had failed to successfully imprint consciousness, the folks behind this movie lacked consciousness.",Replicas
11,bombersflyup,"Watchable, not great.",4,23 August 2020,"Replicas has a decent premise, but doesn't venture into enough interesting or fun places.To get to the state of the premise, feels forced and rushed. Deleting all associated paths to the daughter isn't going to work, as the world around them knows of her existence and it's going to come up. The clones started noticing things and that should have continued and in more detail, in daily routine and social situations instead of the flat ending scenario we get. We didn't need a villain, William's already in a grey area, that could be explored more. His wife even said to think of the subject and yet clones her only thinking what's best for himself. The characterization, dialogue and performances fairly weak.",Replicas
12,phd_travel,The actors sound dumb,5,17 August 2019,Cloning a dead loved one is always a fascinating subject. It's not fun to demand perfect logic but some doesn't make sense. A lot of time is spent on the process but there are holes. Would their hair be the same?Keanu and his dude speak just don't cut it for a scientist. Alice Eve looks alternately petulant and blank.

13,deloudelouvain,Cloning or not?,7,19 March 2019,"I honestly have no clue why people would think this is a horrible movie. I wanted to watch an entertaining sci-fi movie and that's exactly what I got. No super high tech features but a story that makes complete sense and that is futuristic but not that utopic. What would we all do if we lost loved ones and we had the capabilities to bring them back? It's an interesting story, easy to follow and to understand, keeping you interested until the end. Some reviewers wrote the acting was terrible but I can't agree with that at all. It might not be Oscar winning acting but it was for sure better than the average.",Replicas
14,siderite,"Another story about a mad scientist solving ALL of humanity's problems, but caring about stupid things instead",3,16 December 2020,"Against all odds, I like Keanu, and not because of the John Wick series and not because of a nostalgia for Bill and Ted, yet the only possible reason they had him in this film is his proficiency with silly augmented reality interfaces. In other words, he is good at hand waving in the air while looking very serious about it. His casting is almost as bad as Alice Eve's, who seems even more of an introvert and that in a movie about people dying and being resurrected in either robot or clone bodies against their will and with no preparation. She takes it all in with a British stiff upper lip and no emotion. ""We will have words over this!"" There is a particular scene at the end (the beach scene) that is hilarious because of all of its implications, but was not meant as such.Anyway, this film is about a guy who struggles to transfer human consciousness into robotic bodies, but because of a sudden crisis, he not only does that, but he solves the riddle of death, transferring it to fully grown clones that he can create in a week, complete with muscle tone, skin tan and perfectly cut and painted hair. And he has to stop and run because his boss wants to use all of this... to make weapons.In conclusion, it is a really bad story, with a really wrong cast. The acting is not bad, but it's just completely wrong. It fails on so many levels that I had to move the movie to a ""so bad it's funny"" rating. I can only imagine that, by being completely wasted, one would find it hilarious. With the same actors and the same technology and probably the same budget, but a completely different story, this could have been great. Instead, it's just one of those meh films that is closer to Sharknado than to Surrogates, the movie that it presumably tried to ... ahem... clone.",Replicas
15,thesar-2,Parts: The Christmas Horror,5,1 August 2021,"Funny, with the dozens, hundreds?, of movies this is like, the four that just kept coming to my mind were: Frankenstein, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Source Code and 1986's The Fly.So, that should tell you all you need to know. Mad Scientist is selfishly attempting to help all mankind, but no good deed goes unpunished, naturally.Hated comparing this to the masterpiece The Fly, but it did give me those vibes. Not to mention, The Fly II, as well. That said, this movie is littered with flaws, corners cut, too long on certain topics and severely lacking screentime for the goods and plot holes big enough to teleport through.And...I still liked it. Keanu still can't act outside of the John Wick & Bill & Ted franchises, but the rest of the cast was...acceptable as well. I got the idea to see this thanks to the podcast: How Did This Get Made? I listened to about 20 minutes before I realized I wanted to see this and to stop listening to their spoilers.(Sadly, there was one major plot twist that occurs in the final seconds of the movie that the podcasters ruined, but it was pretty easy to figure it out, regardless.)Basically, incredibly dumb Dr. Whoa Keanu is attempting to transfer the recently departed into an A.

19,ops-52535,i think this was an interesting film,9,25 December 2018,"And having read the reviews before seeing this tonight,i simply cant understand,why this is so terrible, if so then star wars,star trek,avatar,and soforth to be showed under the same comb.this isnt a documentary,aka giving a true and revealing description of truth, its a fantasy film en masse,even though some says its possible.i'm an IQ at 130-136,pretty lame that i do not know the truth here......that was nearly a joke,or maybe im cloned,who knows... these days. its after all just entertainment......the film reminds me of the animation films of wall-e and nexgen,when it comes to imaginative skills and i think we all should draw the comparitions to this animated fantasyworlds,rather than concluding that this is just junk and a big lie..
i liked the film, it has an immersive score, colourfilled filmography,a good enough storyline and maybe best of all a very probable sequel to this family saga. there are some loopholes and amnesiac solutions to some practical problems in the plot,but its entertainment, if you had got this film in the early 1990's it would have been a revolution.the acting are above average,but not solid bullseye.well back to basics, cloning and biomedicinal experimentation,are for the grave and very ethical to decide. what i have come to realize is that doing the deed of making a human the natural way are far easier,less expensive,and much more pleasant to do,if you cant there are the egg-way,if you cant there are the adopted way, so if you will wait for the possibility of cloning a perfect you,well hasta la vista , baby.",Replicas

21,cruise01,"Interesting ideas that falls short in laughable script, performances, and forgettable direction.",6,18 January 2019,"Replicas (3 out of 5 stars).Replicas is a decent science fiction thriller that has some interesting concept and ideas but falls short from a terrible script, logic, and dull performances. Without trying to give away many spoilers. William (Keanu Reeves) works for a biomedical research in trying to transfer a mind of a dead person into an android. After an failed attempt. William's wife Mona (Alice Eve), his son Matt (Emjay Anthony), Sophie (Emily Alyn Lind), and Zoe (Aria Leabu) are involved an accident. William becomes a mad scientist that will do whatever it takes to save his family.The film could have been so much more. It has an interesting concept at play such as cloning a human being and transferring their minds into the new body. Also some scary ideas of deleting memories. William becomes a mad scientist that wants to go beyond the laws of nature to save his family. He steals the lab equipment and has it set in his basement. Even his coworker/ friend Ed (Thomas Middleditch) becomes worried of Williams obsession in his research.Sadly, the film does have its fault. It has questionable cgi/visual effects that looks terrible. Especially on the scene with the android coming to life. Looks like a bad Claymation. Second, the script has some laughable dialogue that seems out of place or unbelievable. The first hour of the movie is dull and boring when just watching Keanu Reeve's mad scientists behavior with his experiments. Sure, his actions does get a little messed up and may have trouble trying to find emotions to the character.Keanu Reeves did deliver an emotionless mad scientist in this film. Sure, it may work for his performance as a one dimensional type of character. Alice Eve was decent as her character. Thomas Middleditch was okay as well. And John Ortiz playing the typical corporate bad guy was forgettable.Overall, Replicas is a fair film. It has some entertaining science fiction moments with the concept after the first hour of the movie. The script and visual effects are bad. The performances are stale.

As a whole the film starts off relatively okay and interesting then gets suddenly worse and it's climax isn't very mysterious or suspenseful.There's a reason as to why this film was released in January and why it was a box office flop. It could have been better but it didn't quite amount it much and seemed to get boring and drag on after a while. It became too predictable.,Replicas
23,lisafordeay,Well its not as bad as The Room,5,24 October 2019,"Replicas is a 2018 Sci Fi film starring Keanu Reeves(who also produced this film) and Alice Eve and tells the tale of a a neurologist who's wife and kids die in a car crash and brings them back to life as clones.

Think of this movie as The 6th Day which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as a man who cloned his family. The effects are bad (the robot design is like something out of Robocop from 1987.

This is an updated Frankenstein story. You know, using science to give life back to the dead. Keanu plays a mad...errr, I mean a scientist that works on transferring dead people's brain waves-or their consciousness-into new mechanical bodies. Theoretically, it could help save dead soldiers, sick people, etc. So far, his attempts have been unsuccessful. Alice plays Mrs Keanu and when she and the kids die in an accident, Keanu thinks he can use his research to bring them back to life and save his family. It's lucky that he was just working on something that could solve his problems, if only he can get the kinks knocked out of his previous work. Thomas is Keanu's friend and coworker-his own Igor-and John is Keanu's boss that just wants results.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, disturbing images and sexual references-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.

At great Personal Risk to Himself, he took the Point Man Position in passing along life-saving rolls of Brawny to a beleaguered population. To minimize the sort of chaos and panic gripping America after Hurricane Katrina, Leader Trump held firm on a Maria Death Toll of 14, even though the actual number of Provisional Fatalities soon topped 11,000. As REPLICAS so well illustrates, Leader Trump's Special Edition Brawny Towels--when dipped into the DNA of Maria's would-be victims and nuked for 33 seconds in a special microwave--will bring the Lost back to Life better than New!

26,Pairic,OKish SF Thriller but had the potential to be much better.,6,31 October 2019,"Replicas: It's the old Frankenstein tale retold again with Keanu Reeves as Dr Frankenstein (Dr Foster) and Thomas Middleditch as Egor (Dr Whittle). Foster is working on transferring human consciousness to artificial brains, basically uploading the minds of recently deceased soldiers. But the artificial brain is in a robot and when the latest test subject reaches consciousness (a break through) he can't handle it, mutilates his robot face and attacks people. Foster heads off on short break with his family but the car crashes and he's the only survivor. The lab he works in has a sideline in producing clones, consciousness transferal has worked on animal clones but has never been tested on humans. Whittle helps him to transport clone growing Pods (so suggestive of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, will they be the same?) to Foster's home. But their company is in danger of being shut down if the consciousness to robot transfer doesn't succeed! All may be discovered! Oh,and they're one Pod short so it's bye-bye to one off his kids.It's all a bit far-fetched and more than a little suspension of disbelief is required but apart from a few plot holes it is entertaining. Good performance from Alice Eve as Mona, Foster's wife who is a medical doctor and not that easy to fool. There are also various conspiracies going on at the company Foster works for. Some really violent scenes and a few shocks. All in all an OK SF/Thriller but could have been better. Directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff. 6/10. On Netflix.",Replicas
27,TdSmth5,It had potential,6,16 June 2019,"Keanu is a bio scientist working on implanting the mind (?) of dead (!) soldiers into synthetic bodies. As the movie begins they are working on specimen #345. The mind implant works but when the body is booted the creature rips itself apart. That day his boss informs him that unless they make it work, the project is over. That night Keanu takes his family on a road trip. They suffer a bizarre accident right out of Final Destination which kills the wife and the 3 kids but doesn't harm Keanu. So he decides to ""revive"" his family or at least 3 members of it with the help of colleague Ed. Because at turns out, Ed has been working on some speedy cloning. And sure enough 17 days later, the bodies are grown to the size they were when they died and Keanu after some challenges successfully implants the minds into the cloned bodies. This makes him realize the solution for the 345 body. Of course things with the family aren't entirely smooth.When they bring in another dead soldier, Keanu opts not to implant that mind because there is too much brain damage. Instead he decides to scan his mind. By this point, his boss confronts him about his family, lets him know that the clones are the corporation's property and they can't have some specimens running out in the wild. The family escapes, but is grabbed, and Keanu has to find a way to save his family, himself, and the technology he developed. There are some interesting revelations and a neat ending.Replicas teams two unremarkable writers with a decent director who hasn't directed a movie since 2008 and Keanu in a role entirely not suited for him. The result as expected is less than stellar. I am fond in general of sci-fi movies because they tend to surprise occasionally. And Replicas, too, has a couple of good ideas and some good lines here and there. But why did they have to be so sloppy with the script? They spent a lot of time on irrelevant story instead of ironing out some rather unnecessary plot holes. At a running time of 1:47 they had plenty of time to do so. For a sci-fi movie this one is pretty light on science and replaces it with goofy visual effects of the typical CSI-Miami/Iron Man gesture-driven augmented reality interface. The movie looks good though, Middleditch's character and performance are entertaining. A shame the scriptwriters didn't put some more effort in their work.

High concept on paper that is actually pretty ridiculous, a big name actor who's really better than what they're in and some very sloppy storytelling.

This movie could legitimately be a real thing if we can get the technology more accurate.Regardless, this movie works its butt off establishing the premise, the setup, and then once we're in the action, its all in. The movie is possibly a little smarter than it should be, and (to be honest) there aren't a lot of surprises, but the concept is delightful and the execution is fantastic.Alice Eve is probably my favorite part of this: you'll notice she's angry with him, but doesn't want to do in front of anyone.

That is what makes it more realistic, meaning sometimes only one thing is enough to control to achieve desired result. Although there is lack of some good intro, details of how stuff works, and not based on any specific real scientific theory but rather mix of different basic theories, the fact that it has extremely positive ending, and better than i thought outcomes, it is worth 10 stars rating! It is positivity here that accounts for my rating.Characters, although not the best actors, look realistic and immersed into their own worlds, as if it is all reality for us watchers. No fake or obvious acting or behavior here. This movie has bad beginning, but insanely good ending. It inspires us to never give up, stop believing into, or stop chasing our ""dreams"". It motivates us to discover new (undiscovered) things. The best thing about this movie is the topic, bringing dead people back. Emotional, empathy, religious, lots of hope.This movie is better than most movies because unlike of typical cliche where everyone accepts death and feels bad for it and goes to funeral, there is something better, something more. Hope, faith, strength, and the fact that it is unreal and not explained in detail does not make it in any way worse as sci-fi movie.Also beautiful and realistic look of people, meaning husband looks like real husband, wife like real wife, kids like real kids, boss like real boss.

38,jrarichards,"Wrong on timing and script and packaging, slightly saved by premise ... and Alice Eve",7,5 January 2021,"Jeffrey Nachmanoff's film ""Replicas"" hits the ground running, immediately offering us a lush and quite specific (exotic/claustrophobic/slightly freer of constraints) Puerto Rican location. Indeed, it's Arecibo, so for a subliminal moment we're thinking SETI or something. But no, that's not it. Instead it's high tech (biotech) of a kind we (presumably) don't quite have yet in our world - transferring the consciousness out of fresh (military) cadavers into a (pretty derivative-looking) robot-like entity. This is done by Keanu Reeves as William Foster, assisted by a team that will mostly remain invisible for the rest of the film, with the exception of sidekick Ed (played by Thomas Middleditch).In making such transfers (so far unsucessfully), Foster sticks on his headset and does a ""Minority Report""-type lightning-like series of shifts and selections and moves, all done in nowhere-space - though we CAN see it and it WOULD be impressive ... had we not seen it before ... in ""Minority Report"".So within a few minutes we have the driven genius verging on mad scientist in place and we also soon get to see the consciousness newly present in the robot body reject that scenario psychologically and physically by acting to destroy the fusion in a frenzy of desperate self-abusive and frenetic violence.Now if you've got any kind of consciousness, conscience or brain yourself, and if you've had any experience with sci-fi, you're going to be in a position to think up (or even feel in your bones) at least a dozen scenarios that this film could pursue - and all of them would be worthwhile. And, since cloning comes into it as well, even more so.But in doing so, you'll also be taking a look at your watch, to work out how any of these can be developed as they deserve to be in a 107-minute movie.This is going to leave you - or anyone watching - surprised that the film then has a scenario to set up around the Foster family, and takes a CONSIDERABLE amount of time to do this.Though there is a spoiler warning here anyway, I'm not really going to spill the beans about the end of this ""meet the Fosters"" segment, but it takes a while (as indeed it must, since even then we only get a merest outline of this family); and we move on to the most crucial issues with not much more than an hour left to run.A good-looking Alice Eve plays good-looking wife Mona, but the actress goes beyond the superficials to perform her task of imbuing this character with some depth; and it's pretty good (by the standards of this movie, anyway) - inter alia raising a point about where the soul goes when hubby makes those transfers from dead person to machine. Of course one dubious purpose that serves is to make seasoned sci-fi readers and watchers think about yet-more aspects this movie could go on to explore, even as the clock on it keeps ticking...But another achievement of Alice Eve's here is to make us think that this hot, but also determined, forthright and capable woman brings so much to the Foster marriage table that William is going to do whatever it takes to keep her and keep with her (even though he has certainly been neglecting her up to now for the sake of his work). The film's closest pass with brilliance (not very close, but still) comes in this sense, as at various stages in the film Mrs F proves adaptable, resourceful, resilient and tolerant in a way that hints, even semi-erotically, at a powerful need and bond between the two of them - which she is very much responsible for, even as it is he who keeps taking the action. Frankly, and meanly/sadly, the presence of the kids in the family adds little to that, though of course not zero - especially in the case of the youngest (but no spoilers here). But the fact that there are three more key people-motivators shoved into this piece means our attention gets divided even further, even though there is just no time here for that.Indeed, the treatment of all those potential moral dilemmas about cloning and transferred consciousness and souls and imprisonment (which ""Black Mirror"" naturally dealt with expertly in its inimitable gloomy way) is largely inadequate; with the film's brevity counting hugely against it. While we cannot say that NO issues are explored here - for indeed several actually are - there is never any real time to savour (or plumb greater depths of) what is being sketched minimally, before we hurry on to a next pretty banal and predictable action-cum-conspiracy theme. The failures are plain for all to see when a necessary and quite understandable fugitive/let's-go-into-hiding plot-strand lasts all of 5 minutes (literally!!), before collapsing.The movie also tries to spare a moment or two for a hint of William-Ed buddy comedy, and that is a right and necessary decision ... but still takes up more of those valuable seconds and minutes.Since the script is mostly done and delivered VERY straight (to the point of dullness), and since Reeves is as he is in somewhat-unconvincing mode, we don't really reap many rewards from this film. However, I can't quite bring myself to say ""don't bother"".While Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks in ""The Next Three Days"" do a far better, classier and well-paced job of presenting a hopeful/meaningful message on how marriage really can produce a rather powerful sexy symbiosis of need and willingness to transgress all conventional boundaries, one cannot say this is entirely absent from ""Replicas"".

46,phenomynouss,Can Keanu act?,6,7 November 2021,"This is the sort of film that puts up front and center the question; can Keanu Reeves act? It's been some 20+ years since he made it big with ""The Matrix"", where his character didn't really require much of him in terms of acting ability, but since then he's found a good niche and been making good use of himself in movies since then.In pro wrestling parlance, Keanu's career has been hugely successful because his choice of roles has largely followed the routine of ""accentuate the positives, hide the negatives"" in terms of his acting ability. This film seems to have been a major misstep in that routine, or else Keanu seems to be sabotaging the film with his performance.On its own, this is a serviceable film, largely forgettable unless you are REALLY into the genre of cyborgs and/or cloning. Smart scientist guy who tries to transfer minds from the recently dead into robot bodies is having trouble getting it to work properly, has a wife and 3 kids, and then a car accident takes the lives of his wife and 3 kids.But then due to the nature of his work, he ropes in a guy who works with him who also specializes in cloning, and plots to clone his dead family and then transfer their minds into the clones.A sizeable chunk of the film is devoted to this, to the degree that if it were written to be a moody, creepy ""uncanny valley""-ish horror thriller, it would fit in well and work out. But the mood of the film isn't that at all and it goes a completely different route which is not boring, but not quite as good as it could have been.All of that is secondary though to the big weird throbbing thing that stands out horribly; Keanu's acting. Whether it's intentional or not, his acting when it comes turn for his character to lie is laughably bad, and the scene with him crying over his dead family is just one of the worst I've ever seen.All throughout the film, Keanu is very shaky and stiff in his acting, and at one point near the end, where ""345"" comes into play, his acting gets abysmally worse.

Even in a Sci-fi movie there has to be some logic and this one has some serious flaws in it. Like for example, in what time period is this movie taking place? Nowadays scientists are nowhere close to fully understand how our brain works (and personally I don't think they ever will), yet in this movie they are somehow capable of cloning bodies and replicating consciousness. If it's a futuristic movie then why is every thing else (clothes, phones, cars, homes etc) looks exactly the same? Also, the genius scientist can figure out how to bring his family back to life and erase their memories but can't think of the fact that there are other people out there who may notice when his wife and three kids disappear for almost a month and one kid just vanish into thin air? Even a mad scientist couldn't be that stupid. Those are just two examples, there are so many more. I think the actors knew that and that's why their acting is so bad. It's like they are not even trying to sell the story because they know there's no way to do that. Keanu Reeves is so stiff and emotionless in the movie it almost unbearable. Seriously, I felt more emotions coming from the robot. Also, the dialogue is so SO bad. Especially between William and Ed. Although I must say the evil boss was kind of stupid too. He was like a cartoon and it's ridiculous to think he would actually make a deal and keep it later. Why would he or who ever send him just give up on their plans? Especially since they can have it all. Sorry but the whole movie was just ridiculous, so ridiculous it was actually somewhat entertaining in a comical way. It's watchable as a late night movie that you can laugh at with your friends while drinking beer and eating popcorn, nothing more. Just let your friends know what to expect. I expected to see a good film because I read this movie was made by the same creators who made ""Passengers"" (2016) which is one of my favorite sci-fi movies.

51,HelenMary,Enjoyed it,6,20 May 2019,"I enjoyed this film. It was interesting, entertaining and made you think. There were interesting moral dilemmas to think about. It was mostly well acted and the SFX and set design were believable and good.It was reminiscent of William Gibson (Johnny Mnemonic) or Philip K Dick (A Scanner Darkly) science fiction. Thing is, the story appears to be set in the future (given the tech the characters are using - consciousness transference for example) but everything else in the film is completely current, so the viewer is confused as to when the film is set, how these things are possible.The film isn't perfect, and I can't put my finger on why it doesn't feel like a big sci-fi blockbuster... it is good, but misses something. Maybe because it's not entirely original - it is perhaps derivative, lots of elements that we've seen elsewhere.Reeves was good. Yet again playing the grieving husband, intense, driven, determined and with moral flexibility. Despite other reviewers, I think Reeves was believable as the mad scientist.The only thing frustrating with the film was the cheesy ending. I don't know what a better ending would've been, but it took a predictable and slightly more unbelievable denouement and I would've preferred a continuation of the more cerebral and psychological/ethical dilemma sci-fi thriller theme.Overall a good film that I'd happily watch again.",Replicas

Sorry, this movie can't be indroduced more excitingly.",5,7 December 2018,"What if all those nearest and dearest to you happened to suddenly die but you had a way to bring them back?By which I mean copying the essential part of themness - what makes them them exactly - into freshly cloned biological bodies.Sounds intellectual? This is where this new psychological thriller starring Keanu Reeves and Alice Eve starts but don't worry about it getting all too intellectual and thus boring.I have just managed to summarize it in more interesting way than it actually is. Truth is, ""Replicas"" gets to turn boring in good old-fashioned way - via hammy storytelling and acting.In fact, ""turn"" is an entirely wrong word here. ""Replicas"" doesn't turn boring. It is quite limp and unexciting from the start, then at several points hints at possibility of evolving into something... but then just coils into fetal position on the floor and starts sucking its thumb.Reeves's character - the modern Frankenstein - takes the central place, and his performance is appropriately lifeless and uninspired, just as the story.Which doesn't come as a surprise, for he's always had a limited range as an actor, thus fitting better into action than anything dramatic (such as this role where he has to mourn the death of closed ones).Then again, it's hard to tell what exactly gets Reeves going in front of the cameras. There are other comparably badly written movies where he seems perfectly adequate, such as 2016's ""The Whole Truth"" to offer a recent example.But ""Replicas"" is not one of those successful projects. The material doesn't ignite, and neither does the leading man.Alice Eve, on the other hand, gives a convincing and relatable performance as a good wife wrestling with doubts and difficulties to forgive her husband for certain terrible deeds.But she doesn't have much screen time, so she's does not get nowhere near a chance of rescuing the movie.The problem is that despite the movie's eagerness to imitate other, better sci-fi stories, most of what happens goes by without any adequate explanation or logical progression.One minute the hero does not know how to move the human consciousness between bodies without horrible results, very soon he already succeeds at first try, and several times in a row. One minute we learn that the security chips can't be taken out of clones bodies, the next they do just that without any problem, etc.In a story like that, there is also always an intriguing question of whether the clones would turn bad or fail in some major way.The wait for something along these lines gives the movie some suspense but... let's just say that the authors have not searched for or found meaningful ways to explore that topic.The coolest thing about ""Replicas"" may be the fact that us Estonians get to see it in cinemas full two months before the US. Doesn't sound that cool? Sorry, that's all I've got...Oh well. Let's hope it's not gonna be successful, so the producers are not tempted to clone this into a franchise or something.",Replicas

It provides no meaningful follow-through with all its intriguing set ups, while most of its action and meant to be tense scenes end abruptly, almost as if the director was aching to finish the movie faster than the 17 days it must've taken to write this script, like cloned bodies in a pod.Replicas is ridiculous on several levels; the acting was lackadaisical, the story was shamefully, woefully and regrettably superficial and under developed, the plot holes were so big, they could've been movies of their own, the CGI exposed the film's financial constraints, the action was underwhelming at best and the directing, was choppy.Nevertheless, because I am a fan of Keanu Reeves, I did to some extent, enjoy this movie, and Alice Eve is a fit Brit whose a pleasure to look at, even when she isn't in the mood to act.

He may be able to do this because his job at Biodyne based in Puerto Rico is to take a dead body and imprint that person's brain into a Robot. Will and co-worker Ed Whittle (Tomas Middleditch) have cloned animals before, but to clone a human would be the first of its kind. Ed is always leery with what they are going to do, but is supportive and goes along with Will.There is nothing uncomfortable in here story-wise. Ooops, well the procedure involves a needle into the eye of the person being imprinted (for memories) be it a dead person or a live one (that you will see later on). I turned my head when this happens as I am quite squeamish. You don't miss anything by turning your head except a few bad dreams.There are some bumps in the road but Will figures things out. You will notice much tension and suspense throughout and that is a good thing.There are 2-twists, one being when Will ultimately finds out the company he is working for is not what they say they are; and the other twist is the very last scene in the movie. You will like it.Notables: John Ortiz as Jones, Will's boss; Emjay Anthony as Matt, Will's son, Emily Alyn Lind as Sophie, Will's daughter; Ana Lyric Leabu as Zoe, Will's other daughter.This may be a glimpse into a possible future for humanity so don't poo-poo it too quickly. As you go along you will have many questions you think will be answered in here, but no, they will not be answered.This is a very well done SCI-Fi movie. Keanu Reeves out does himself in here as does Alice Eve as Mona, Will's wife, who - as you know- is extremely beautiful and a very good actress. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

There are way better films like ""The Sixth Day"" , ""Godsend"" and even ""Replicant"" which this film generously borrows from.The unoriginal story is filled with unexplained plot holes and the characters do the most unbelievable things. Because of that, you are never drawn into the story because it all simply makes no sense. You don't care for the characters because the humans don't act like human beings.I Love Keanu Reeves in ""The Matrix"", ""Point Break"" and ""John Wick"" but here his wooden acting can't hide the fact that he was bored throughout the entire film. That also goes for the rest of the cast. His wife acts like a replicant even before she becomes one. That's some acting at an all time low.The special effects are limited to scenes where Keanu does the ""Minority Report"" thing with the CGI screens and the robot that directly walked away from the ""I Robot"" set. The robot in question hardly moves and when he does, the effects are lousy compared to ""I Robot"".

64,kingofdanerds,L-A-M-E. That spells Replicas,2,14 September 2020,"Replicas is a 2019 Keanu Reeves sci fi thriller. It was released in January and upon release was already considered one of the worst films of 2019. The film had a $30 million budget but flopped so hard that it only made back a little over $9 million. The film recieved negative reviews from critics and audiences alike and it is very easy to see why.The film follows Keanu Reeves who works at this company where they are working on transfering the minds of dead soldiers into robots. But when he goes on a car ride with his family, a car accident occurs which kills his wife and kids and somehow leaving him unscathed. Reeves and his friend Ed (played by the guy who is in those Verizon commercials and Silicon Valley) to clone his family and bring them back.Wow. This film is sooooooooooo lame. First, the story. The little synopsis that I just gave looks good on paper but has a few problems. I was expecting a sort of Frankenstein type of film where cloning has some negative repercussions. It appears that way at first, but the film dissappoints and basically says cloning your family is a great idea. Another thing is that we start with transferring minds into robot bodies and for some reason we head to cloning. It makes no sense whatsoever. But with this story comes plenty of plot holes as well. There is one big plot hole involving the erasing of memories of one of the family members and it's like ""Hello? There are literally hundreds of people who will remember that she existed?"" In all, the story is just lame, dull and boring. The acting is horrendous. It is even sometimes laughable. Keanu Reeves gets often casted in the wrong roles and this role is one of those times where he was casted wrong. But he gives it his all. As for the other actors/actresses, WHO EVEN CARES????? Well, except for the Verizon guy. He was alright I guess. While this film is not full of special effects, when there are special effects (really just with the robot), they are bad. But at this point, I am not very surprised by this film. The runtime luckily is only 107 minutes but wouldn't have been great if it was even shorter? The ending is dumb and actually quite hilarious if you think about it.Replicas is just a lame sci fi film. Had it went along the lines of maybe Frankenstein, the film could have been a little better.

The acting is, at it's best moments mediocre. The CGI is laughable for a 2018 movie. The designs are quite poor too, the technology definitely doesn't look credible, the robot is the worst in terms of realism and design.
The basic story line is interesting, and there are good moments as it develops, add Keanu Reeves (which let's be honest, his presence gave this movie so many extra rating points by fans!) and you've got something to watch for a couple hours.
The script is bad, it goes from good moments where (with a little bit of forgiveness) you even believe what's going on, to totally dumb moments that seem to be situations that the writer couldn't manage to figure out how to solve in a credible way.
In my opinion, this is a case of bad direction, see the poor performances, the weird setting (tropical place? why?! cheaper?), overall poor designs, bad writing...
Too many things wrong, but maybe a good choice (or luck) on casting Reeves has saved this movie from a way worse rating.

There's no way a high tech company would make the necessary investment in a place that was so unreliable with infrastructure. That fact aside there are many other issues with the plot line. Early on the Keanu scientist has to decide which member of his family he will not bring back from death. He erases the memories of the the child that doesn't survive in the minds of his family. It never occurs to him that other people knew the child existed. Those tidbits are from the beginning of the movie and it gets more complex and convoluted from there. What bothers me most is that this technology is certainly under development as I write this but there was little to know discussion or debate about the ethics of what was done. That may be humanity's downfall in the end. We have no respect for God's creation and think we can just photocopy his design. I think not.,Replicas

Fear not as he and his trusty scientific sidekick Ed Whittle (played wonderfully by Thomas Middleditch) hatch a plan to transfer the minds of his family into cloned beings. The movie spends about half the time setting up the story and growing the clones.I should mention that four family members die in the crash, but he has enough clone juice for three of them, so he wipes the memory of their youngest child from everyone elseNow he has the bodies, but not the minds. The ""mind"" is saved into a hard drive, but he has to figure out why previous attempts of mind transfer have failed. But he eventually figures it out in a flash of insight.He revives the family and everyone lives happily ever after. Except they don't. His wife finds out that they're clones, his boss, ""Jones"" finds out that he's cloned his family, and now it becomes a chase scene. Boss wants the family dead, and the algorithm for the mind transfer.More stuff happens, a robot Bill foster kills all the bad guy, but revives the main bad guy so he can make tons of cash transferring minds from old rich people to younger clones.Oh, and now the family lives happily ever after, along with their cloned youngest daughter, who Bill was able to bring back to life.Sigh, this movie had potential. They could have gone the route of the cloned family remembering the daughter. They could have gone the route of the ethics of what he did. They could have followed his internal struggle to deal with a replica family. Instead, they went for a boring first half with a boring chase scene near the end.Moreover, Keanu Reeves is simply just not right for this role. And Alice Eve, who plays his wife, comes off as just wooden. Really the only bright spot was Thomas Middleditch, and maybe a couple of chuckle lines from Jones.5/10.

The dialog is a little drawn out and the writer Stephen Hamel should've thought a little more about fleshing out this idea because I was totally lost. Some scenes made no sense. Too bad Reeves talent as an actor is wasted here. This type of film would've been better if the part of William Foster went to Matt Damon or Kevin Bacon because Reeves just doesn't work here! I kept watching the film to see how it developed and was so glad it ended. It's a much better movie. The moral of this story is ""Don't mess with physical laws of science.""

And let's be honest if your whole family died you may be in shock, when you lose your child, hysterics is what happens, maybe catatonic? You don't immediately say well ""F$&% it, let's clone them, ""hey coworker/family friend, can you chop up my family and dispose of them? Thanks, I owe you one."" And who chooses their wife over their children?? A crappy parent. Then he adds insult to injury and deletes Zoe. Why wouldn't you save the kids and explain away mom?

Overall, the movie is enjoyable to watch. However those science technologies are so brainless and easy to find loopholes. The movie involved many different science topics, they're entertaining in some ways, but very fake. At least clone starts from an embryo; this movie's clone only needed 17 days and produced a fully grown human, regardless adult or kids, all matured in same time length, this plot is so fake.Also if we dig further about the replica's self conscious and moral conscience, it's hard to believe that the replica wife not even questioning her identity after being told she's a clone. And the most interesting part is to convert human conscious into database, and memory can be edited and deleted, unfortunately the movie didn't expanse this idea.Anyway, it's a nice popcorn movie with interesting sci-fi concepts, but after all, it's still a typical Hollywood family story, a man will do everything for his family, an action/drama movie with science outerwear.",Replicas

Sadly this character did not, but it was not just him, even Alice Eve looks tired and limited her repertoire of expressions to mild agitation and disbelieve.

There are some nonsensical plotpoints in internal logic as well as in the science parts.
The script itself however is really good. You don't notice how long the movie is despite not much happening throughout, because it keeps you engaged throughout.
The acting comes off as slightly off but this could be a deliberate creative choice seeing what the subject matter is.Where the movie really shines is how it deals with its topic. I doubt a single person would have expected things to go the way they do in the movie. All this completely without cheap twists and gotcha moments, just toying with audience expectations.

Keanu Reeves is a poor choice for the lead actor. His acting, his voice, his manners, all come out fake. He definitely should restrain himself to his typical roles: Constantine, John Wick, The Matrix, The Day the Earth Stood Still.
Being a fan of Science Fiction movies, I generally will give low rating movies a chance. Well ...
In addition to the poor acting, the director thought that some gibberish science was needed to make it more ...?
The top of the top of the movie happens at the end, on a paradisiac beach with coconut trees and the return of the so much beloved one. As a ridiculous cliche, one cannot do better.

170,qljsystems,An entertaining and clever movie lacking in emotional depth,7,5 November 2019,"I disagree with the poor reviews given to this movie. I think the basic problem is that this movie fails to deliver a satisfying emotional experience, which arises from more subtle reasons than the premise and plot.So, to start with: the premise. A scientist is working on a solution to capture a recently dead person's personality and memory from their brain and imprint that personality into a new host. This in itself isn't necessarily an original idea. It's been done before in various guises - there's a number of movies that either edge towards or directly intersect with this concept.You'd be hard-pressed to find truly unique story ideas, given that there's only about 34 of them as defined by Georg Polti, and most fictional stories have been told before in one form or another. But what distinguishes movies is their emotional payoff. For that to happen, you need to feel invested in the story people and in their success and safety.This is the basic difference between an action spectacular knights-in-armour movie and Braveheart. The former is likely to have an unengaging story with big battle sequences that leave you emotionally confused as to their significance in an otherwise unconvincing plot. The latter is a sweeping panoramic movie that slowly builds up a compelling movie of revenge and betrayal and final, bittersweet victory. The difference? Character portrayal and development in which the audience can feel invested.I really like Keanu Reaves, I really do. I have a lot of admiration for him. He's experienced personal tragedy. He's a truly humble individual, who recognizes he's richer than nearly everybody else on Planet Earth. I love many of his movies - Bill & Ted, The Matrix Series, Johnny Mnemonic, Speed, Point Break, Dracula, Devil's Advocate, The Lake House, A Walk In The Clouds, A Scanner Darkly. I think he's a convincing drama and action actor, and has the presence and authenticity to carry spectacular and epic movies. But for all of those strengths, Keanu simply isn't a character actor.The problem with Replicas is that it's a character story dressed up as a tech/sci-fi action flick. For all the technical wizardry and robotics, the story is at heart one about an emotional journey and a cat-and-mouse pursuit denouement.The way this movie could've played out was predictable, because of its intrinsic nature, and there was little drama to be found in the plot that would surprise the audience. We pretty much preconceive the decisions Dr William Foster will take, whether it's the replication of his family killed after a vehicle accident or to activate his personality in the robot to help beat up the bad guys and protect him and his family.Where the movie's focus was aimed at was the agony Dr Foster experiences in the loss of his family, the hard decision he has to make to eradicate the memory of his smallest child because there are insufficient clone pods to replicate his entire family, the disconnectedness his cloned wife feels, and the interplay between Dr Foster and his voice-of-his-conscience gatekeeper character colleague Ed Whittle. Unfortunately, these aspects of the film were too lightly brushed over in terms of character development. This gives the movie a whole painted-by-numbers feel. We get to experience little of Foster's grief and pain as he makes one difficult decision after another, in favour of instead progressing the plot and solving the mystery of overcoming the hindrances to successfully replicating a dead human being. It's suggested that this movie was offered to Nicolas Cage before Keanu decided to play it himself, and it's probably for the same reason as above that Nicolas turned down the movie. It fails to develop the character and attract our investment in him.Keanu is very good at what he does and, though I'd say some of his more recent movies like John Wick 1 to 3 are pretty flat and one-dimensional, he's starred in some spectacular movies, and what he's good at he's very good at. But he simply isn't able to carry a character study. And this is what Replicas is at heart.",Replicas
171,t-unknown-one,Get's one star for the idea...,1,26 December 2018,"...but that's about all. The concept of bringing back dead loved ones (what could go wrong?) is as old as The Monkeys Paw written in 1902, but it does leave open the possibility of great emotional drama if handled correctly. So they get one star for that possibility but this film drops the ball at the whistle and never recovers. One reviewer said it sucked and Keanu Reeves does a great job of making it even worse. I laughed so hard at that one because it basically took the words right out of my mouth. Reeves cannot act. Cannot even pretend to act. His dialogue delivery has always been wooden and awkward, now he can't even run convincingly. There is one scene where he almost becomes emotionally believable but by then it's far, far too late.

One particular scene when 2 police officers knock his door explaining that car parts have been stolen - OMG i was shocked at his acting skills. He was like an emotionless statue through most of the movie. It felt like someone had their hand stuck up his a** and was using him as a sock puppet.I know its a movie but so many things were unrealistic and just wouldn't happen.***************************** MAJOR SPOILERS****************************For instance:His entire family die in a crash and he doesn't even have a scratch on him?How many times is he going to ask his friend to help?

181,Victreebong,"Not a 2, but a clunky third act hurts it.",7,13 January 2019,"A lot of people have written ""poor acting"" and ""bad CGI"", but I disagree. Reeves has always had a stoic disposition. The three other main actors span between sociopathic, culpably invested, and literally brainwashed. So range of emotions isn't supposed to be light-hearted and cheery. As far as CGI... the movie could have used a little more polish in the end but the first and second act have CGI similar to Iron Man's HUD.The movie follows the plot line of mad doctor obsessed with bringing back the dead. The Frankenstein trope. Keanu plays a greiving father who loses his family during the start of a family vacation. He is of course a lead scientist for a secretive biotech facility. His coworker who is a fellow genetics tech and family friend (an Igor if you will) comes to his aid during the eve of the incident. The obvious ensues.The movie's strengths are in the first and middle act, where Reeve's copes with loss and balances the forces against him. At no time did the movie feel out of sequence, and it actually moves along fairly well. The third act though, is when plot A and B cross paths, and then a plot C somehow evolves through the middle. It goes from drama to a chase, and ultimately something out of iRobot. The finale is straight up absurd, but it's science fiction. Not science fact. My guess is they were torn between how to end it.I'd recommend this to anybody who has lost loved ones or sci-fi buffs. It may feel familiar, but it was definitely not a waste of time. Keanu is never a waste of time, catch it at Redbox or on Netflix if you don't see it in theatres.",Replicas

The premise is good and familiar, going back all the way to Robocop and Ghost in the Shell, the idea of merging human with machine is interesting. The technical aspect was OK. The rejection of the robot body by the subject mind was plausible and the answer was also good, ie. Use someone with foreknowledge and agreement to lessen shock and mimic body function responses to make the brain think it has a body.Then the movie spent a lot of time goofing around with minutiae of growing the bodies, destroying memories, evading the employer, trying to figure out if the employer is an evil giant or what. Toward the end, it became interesting. Alice Eve's portrayal upon finding out she had died was the most convincing scene and deserving of more dramatic time. The family reaction and the new business conducted by the resurrected corporate guy and android was the last 15 minutes of the show but offered more story potential than the Frankenstein beginning. I like Keanu Reeves, in roles that work well for a stoic. He presents a stoic image to the camera, period.

200,Janebo,Terrible,3,26 November 2020,"Just read some of the longer reviews that are 4 stars or less, they tell you everything I feel about this messy mess of a film.
Great concept, I love sci fi and horror both, but the script, acting and execution, were the absolute bottom of the barrel. I'm laughing at the gushing 8+ star ""reviews"", they couldn't have possibly watched the same movie. Or don't watch many movies and/or are friends of Keanu.
I know 5 year olds with more depth and intelligence than this movie and like somebody already mentioned, the only thing that would have made it worse, is if Nicholas Cage was in it. As it is, Keanu is his usual self, the wooden actor we all know. Alice Eve, atrocious and the kids, well, hopefully they have other things to do besides trying to act.But I'd never tell people not to watch something. Just be warned, it's painful.

I just don't get how the actors weren't made to reshoot most of the scenes until they did a good job of it.

Cons - graphics....the robot is about 5 years ahead of The Lawnmower Man I would say. Very poor for a movie that was made in 2016 (released 2019).William (Keanu) makes a decision which I felt needed more exploration and conflict. It seemed far too an easy decision was made without the character weighing it up - you'll know when you see it.Acting - as mentioned in other reviews - not the best but to be honest I would blame the script, it is very poor and the dialogue is atrocious in some scenes.Pace - I found the first act to be slow paced, the second was very enjoyable and if it would have remained at this level it would have been a much better film - Third Act - I found I was looking at my phone. The pace really slowed and didn't seem to find its rhythm again.Ending - slightly satisfying albeit i found some questions unanswered. A very weird end to the movie which didn't really fit.

Exciting with a very believable concept of human cloning and transferrance of consciousness. Several unexpected twists that I did not see coming. I was glued to the big screen from beginning to end. Maybe closed my eyes for that car crash and one other moment. Even knowing how it turns out will not stop me from viewing Replicas again. Keanu is brilliant at dragging me kicking and screaming out of my own mind and into his vastly capable imagination. This emotional rollercoaster seemed utterly believable to me.

231,zampino-2,Not very credible and not very loveable,4,28 January 2019,"I like the overall idea behind the movie, and had it been presented on a smaller scale perhaps it would have worked better--did they have to try to replicate the entire family? The CG android was perhaps one of the least remarkable I've seen in a modern movie, and the scope of the lab - both organic cloning & android mental transfers - was inexplicable and overreaching. Apparently the writers and directors thought they could appeal to a number of sci fi interests at once, but it just comes off as ridiculous, under-explained and extremely far-fetched. The acting was rigid and unimpressive, and I found myself completely detached from every character. The family was roundly unlovable, the villanous boss not particularly hatable, and the side character's death just a footnote with no emotional weight. If the science fiction was a bit implausible at least they could have tried to make the viewer care about, well, anybody in the movie.Despite their trying to highlight some of their character's own plot errors along the way, there are so many inexplicable errors and disconnects in this movie that eventually you have to just accept it as fantasy. The entire family of disparate ages was cloned in 17 days to the exact age each had been at death? All of the equipment needed to clone 3 people was quickly moved and setup in one night? The transfer of memory only takes moments? The ability to selective erase experience and memory is some kind of trivial exercise? Keanu was able to steal dozens of car batteries and create a backup battery for them in a few hours? It goes on and on, so many plot holes or suspension of reality. Why did they even bother having the police stop by and accept his ridiculous denial when he was the only house not affected? Not a single person stopped by in those 17 days to check on the family after 5 days went by without a word?In the end I found myself comparing the movie to Douglas Trumbull's ""Brainstorm"" with Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood, which has parallels in the ability to record and retrieve memories from people. There the director and writers introduce a level of credibility in the mechanics of the science, explore the direction and misdirection of the concept, and made us care about the characters and the issues between them. ""Replicas"" instead relies on computer graphics that don't adequately support the ""science,"" quickly introduce the corporate corruption of the concept at the very last moment, and never create a compelling family dynamic.

In fact, I am quite surprised that the twist we see at the very end was not the major plot: instead of spending all that paid actor time on a rather shallow sequence of events on how to save his family that could have been dealt with rather quickly at movie start, building on the aspect of ""any mind into any body"" would have made for a much better plot as the main storyline. The rich guy at the very end was clearly being injected with Reeves' mind, just like the corporate guy before him. Creating infinite replicas of the scientist would have made for a much more thrilling twist to the outcome of events, instead of a few pistol-armed security guards being wiped by some robot, that for some unexplained reason gets the physical abilities of a battledroid.

I am someone who appreciates the art and I appreciate how much work goes into a film and I am sure the director poured his heart into this. Sometimes writing can let you down and to be fair the writer is still learning, I have tried writing a screenplay and it is really hard. The cinematography was great and it had so much potential.

And I often think critics and people alike exhibit a herd mentality-fawn over certain films and actors (The upteenth remake of A Star is Born;only the manner of Cooper's demise differs from previous versions ) and reject others because hey no one wants to be seen/perceived as not being relevant.Against this backdrop, I attended a screening of Replicas and found it not to be as horrible as has been suggested. Science has mapped the human cortex, cloned animals have been created, robotic arms are used in surgery, businesses use robotics to reduce the human worker and cinema has long held a fascination with conscious upload/the innate desire to prolong life/to conquer death, virtual reality, altered states of consciousness, pods, tabula rosa, genetic editing, what constitutes or defines us as human. And would we really want to live forever?Hamel's writing of Replicas was inconsistent and like Siberia could not decide what theme/idea and the implementation of that idea it wanted to pursue and focus its energy on. It might have been a meditation on grief and how grief shapes the decisions we make, the nature of returning a loved one from death and the affect it would have on those who have been resurrected. Would they want to return? There is a singular scene in which this issue is raised then discarded.Replicas might have been more effective if Reeves' scientist had simply transplanted the brain (s) into the robot/pods rather than imprinting them. Strictly speaking, he doesn't create clones. The film veers late into Obadiah Stane territory. Shoddy direction doesn't help. Reeves was at his best when having to decide who could be saved and then having to erase the memory/existence of one of his children.Somewhere therein was a decent film struggling to get out",Replicas

However, there is a point after which the gaping holes in logic begin to tear away at that world we've let the filmmakers create. Replicas destroys that bubble and then some.The most egregious example is the 'missing' person. The protagonists' solution to it really pushes our tolerance of plot armor but its radiating effects are just too absurd to be ignored. Tragically, the entire subplot was seemingly shoved in for no fathomable reason. The film would have been just as compelling without that absurdity and would have been more believable, too.I like Keanu but this was a terrible choice of film, my man.",Replicas

261,cinswan,Sci-Fi With a Couple Dropped Threads but Still Makes You Think,8,28 January 2019,"Spoiler alert: to review a sci-fi movie as sci-fi, can't stop with just one spoiler...William Foster (Keanu Reeves), obsessed neuroscientist along with friend (or is he really?) Ed (Thomas Middleditch) go from being dutiful employees of a mysterious biotech company (or is it?) to mad scientists cloning a dead family in the basement. Includes stealing billions of dollars' worth of equipment from the employer, and seventeen days of no sleep for obsessed and sometimes grieving Foster, who sleeps with his youngest daughter's stuffed unicorn during the basement vigil (a cute, funny, and subtle homage to Blade Runner, where the unicorn was a key). Oh, that youngest daughter? Not part of the original clone party. Drawing lots hurts even for a brilliant neuroscientist. Three plus one (him) yields four, and the fifth member seems lost.All the relevant philosophical and ethical questions are brought up in the first part of the movie (so don't skip the opening dialog scenes). A horrible crash on a dark and stormy night renders corpses ready for cloning (though who collected the DNA matter isn't explicitly laid out). The special effects used to transfer neural patterns from a brain donor to a host (first and last, a robot, for a nice plot twist) are well done, an homage and further refinement of those used in Minority Report.Like any creation, however, beautiful wife Mona in the tradition of her nineteenth-century literary predecessor - Frankenstein's Monster - calls her creator on his crap more than once, providing the noble (or is he) scientist a couple servings of humble pie.But wait! Before the heavy questions can be addressed, much less answered, the thicken plots (pardon the spoonerism). In sci-fi movie tradition, there's the danger, the chase, the suspense, the unmasking of the boss (John Ortiz) as being a nefarious capitalist who hasn't been honest with his intelligent workers about his business plan.There are a few details, in addition to the unicorn, that show the kinds of writerly touches sci-fi writers employ, such as the name of the uncloned daughter Zoë (meaning life); symbolic use of numbers, in this case 345 (numbers in divine sequence with implication of the importance of the wholeness of the body); and an homage to Johnny Mnemonic, when William Foster hides in the men's room to transfer his own neural network to its little box so it can be transferred to robot William. Better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick...but you know the boss is going to walk into the men's room just when a neuroscientist needs to have a steady hand.Continuity flubs happen, so I wasn't looking for those. Even Casablanca has a major one - no, Ilsa wasn't wearing a blue dress in Paris; she was wearing a suit, which Ted Turner's TNT Classic Film coloring revealed. However, there are a couple of plot lapses that go against the science outlined in Replicas that make you go 'hmmmmmm...'One: If transferring the brain patterns of a person to a halo that's then going to be put on a clone means the brain needs to be intact (hence the boss giving the order to NOT shoot William in the head - did you really think he wouldn't get duplicated himself?) then you have to ask - after blunt force trauma that would cause a TBI thanks to robot William bashing boss Jones against the tile floor, would transferring his neural network to his clone yield a fully functional Jones? Certainly his reptilian hindbrain is left intact...Second: if the cloning process algorithm is designed to yield a clone of the original person at their same age if incubated for the seventeen required days no more no less no power interruption in cloning goo, then why would an ailing rich man want his own body to be cloned? Or, was his neural network destined for a different clone (which goes against Foster's discovery that the neural network would only work if transferred to a body that would feel familiar, which he creates for robot William by transferring his physical algorithms to the machine)? Then there's the bullet between the eyes for brownnosing Ed (karma's instant) so does someone else have his cloning skills? Robot William?As a sci-fi writer, I do the best I can to make sure that the science part of my plot lines is consistent and makes sense within its context, even though fiction by its very definition requires a suspension of disbelief on the part of the reader/viewer. It's hard work and yes there can be flaws despite a writer's caution to avoid them. Despite these two gaffes, this movie is good cheesy fun with a few holes like a slice of Emmenthaler, paired with some dialog that gives a yummy and salty taste of ham. Put them between two slices of French Toast and you've got a Monte Cristo sandwich for brunch.The happy ending gives the impression that all the loose ends have been tied up, but have they? The philosophical questions remain, the ethics still debatable. Beautiful clone Mona questions William's wisdom, recalling Mary Shelley's premise: just because you can doesn't mean you should. As Thomas Brophy Ph.D. said, ""the mechanism demands a mysticism"" and William Foster, like Victor Frankenstein, in a moment of grief turns to desperate anger and fails to see the truth, found in quantum physics not bioscience, that what makes us human is our soul, not our brain. The ghost in the machine defies the 17th century Cartesian logic upon which the biosciences with their mind/body concepts rely, much to the chagrin of Schrödinger's cat, who walked into a bar and didn't.Isabeau Vollhardt

262,dequalizer,Isn't that bad,7,28 August 2019,"Despite all the negative reviews I found the movie entertaining, yes it has a lot of plot holes, bad script and not the best acting but the story is interesting , all in all it's a watchable movie as long as you don't have high expectations.",Replicas
263,griffo-86546,Lower your expectations,3,17 July 2020,"The goodThe movie feels like a straight-to-DVD or TV movie but it works ok as long as you're expecting a brainless and low quality popcorn flick. Despite it's many flaws, the movie maintained enough interest to watch it to the end.The acting by Thomas Middleditch was solid and his character was relatable to the audience as he brought much needed grounding to the story and particularly the irrational behaviour of William.Not having enough ""pods"" for everybody was an interesting twist. If they hadn't gone down the path of a typical Hollywood happy ending, this could have been further explored with the protagonist continuing to be racked with guilt over this decision and having to find a way to eventually accept and live with it.Although many other cliches were present, including the double cross, the big bad corporation and so on, as other reviewers have noted the ending deserves credit for originality in delivering a mutually acceptable resolution for both the protagonist and antagonist rather than taking the easy way out with one of them dying.The bad:The subject matter of transferring consciousness from human to machine has been done before and much better in many other films and TV shows, including Transcendence (2014), Source Code (2011) and Black Mirror (2011-), although that isn't saying much.Acting by Alice Eve was garbage and we weren't given enough time with the family or reasons to really care about them.Keanu Reeves had the emotional range of a bag of flour, although if you've seen any of his previous movies, you wouldn't be watching for his acting skills.Suspension of belief is definitely required for this movie. That in itself is not a problem, but I found myself accepting certain absurdities as believable such as the consciousness transfer and human cloning whilst others I simply couldn't because of lazy scripting and execution with notable examples as follows:For anybody who has worked on an algorithm in real life, the idea that it could be ""finished off"" by one person in an evening let alone retained in that person's memory is laughable.An algorithm that requires at the very least a detailed knowledge of engineering, biology and computing and the interactions between them would require an army of people working for years and millions of lines of code. Instead Keanu Reeves waves his hands around Minority Report (2002) style whilst calling out random areas of the brain combined with letters from the phonetic alphabet in a hopeless attempt to make the scene credible. Although I didn't particularly like Transcendence (2014), at least it doesn't insult your intelligence in this way by leaving the 'how' part up to your imagination.I also don't know how this scene could have been better handled, but let's be honest, a cheesy montage at this point wouldn't have made the movie any worse.Another thing that bugged me was the idea that a hugely complex system like memory could have sections targeted and deleted by a simple keyword search. It's a human brain, not Notepad.",Replicas

I believe we will be in shock and react in that manner. Instead he is composed and finds a fix for this. Kind of unnatural reaction, don't you think? Big fan of Keanu Reeves, but in this one, it's like I see a steamed down, family version of John Wick, not a real human being.Then, this friend comes along and helps him with 4 dead bodies, with little conscience problems. As if this is a little problematic, but I'm ok of hiding 4 bodies and steal 8 millions dollars of equipment and nobody asks questions. True, they try to justify this in a way, but still it feels farfetched.I can go on with this, but I think there are short videos called what is wrong about this movie in 2 minutes or something.Thus, my opinion is that this movie had potential if they tried a bit more to be convincing and the characters would have been more human.

I must say that the actual cinematic execution was not the best, but the tech credits were all fine with me. It looked good, the acting was satisfactory and the CGI wasn't bad. But my main reason for loving this story is that the concept of cloning and transferring the brain has been a sci-fi idea since maybe mid-last century, but no one has brought it to the screen in this way. This is exactly what was predicted so long ago, and may be an actuality in the future. There was no preaching about the morality involved, which I relished. It was just a straightforward account of the possible science involved. (oh, and I made a guess about the problem they were encountering and how it might be solved before the movie revealed it.) The ending, which I was sure would end badly, was upbeat, as far as I'm concerned. I'm glad to see Keanu chose this. I'm sure he's aware of the scientific possibilities and the hope it inspires.

If you liked ""The Sixth Day"" and the 90's ""Outer Limits"" TV show then you'll love this movie. I gave it ten stars to try to boost the rating, but it deserves a 7 or 8. The story is about a scientist working on transferring human consciousness into a robot body. His family is tragically killed in a car accident and he brings them back through cloning and sci-fi. He can't do it alone so he has to drag his friend into it. He only has three pods so he can't bring one of them back. Will it work, will he get caught, will there be complications, maybe his company is evil, etc. The basic plot isn't unique, but this story is a new twist on that plot. Critics are panning the acting. Keanu Reeves was great, not epic, but it's just a movie. The rest of the acting was very believable too. This movie uses CGI as it should, to create things like robots, labs, and crashes that could possibly exist, but would be too expensive. The critics didn't like Robo Cop when it came out and that's a classic. Anyway, critics love a lot of crap movies and sometimes they're too picky about good ones.",Replicas

My eye is sharp on CGI, and I can spot it without a problem whether it's a good or a bad CGI. In this movie CGI was bad, you don't even need a trained eye to spot it, amateur work. But the good point is that the CGI is not heavily used, it's very minimal thorough the movie besides the Augmented Reality usage here (of which I am unsure if it counts as CGI or not, since it is in a sense an Computer Generated Imagery).
Basically only at start where it's(the CGI component) the most active, and at the end. And the only such amateur CGI component is, is the robot itself, and it wasn't the focus of the movie too, so the influence of bad CGI was forgiving and not much taken into account. It could've scaled the rating up to 8 probably if it was high grade CGI.Overall I liked the idea of the movie, didn't noticed dialogue problems and acting, except maybe here and there, those were small confusing places without huge impact, but that would've been a nit-picking stuff, since overall acting was good. It sure isn't a high budget John Wick sequel, but it's done well to scale at least on 7 mark if not more, or 6.5.Sure there was some weird logic behind one or two things, or something that didn't made sense, yet it wasn't a huge deal anyway, but if you want to watch a movie for decent enjoyment at late evening, then this wasn't an disappointing movie, and was enjoyable.",Replicas

Yes, they do human cloning.Now if we don't jump into the details on how and why, the movie will fascinate you.But if we decide to go into the details as the our human brain will ask us that how such a complicated process of human cloning can take place in the basement of a house and all subjects of different ages can take 17 days to fully grow? (Because a child should take less days to reach his/her age than someone who's much older like a mother).I can list many and I'm sure those who will watch will also find these issues with the storyline but the bottom line is that this is an intriguing idea which is poorly implemented but still I would recommend it to people to watch.",Replicas

You have 3 children and wife, but only 3 pods for replication, and you immediately ""save"" your wife (wtf?????), and have to make a choice between your children.

If your hoping to put your brain on autopilot and have a pleasant little romp into Sci-fi, Replicas is for you. This had a very simple plot, likable protagonists, and a villain that didn't show his true agenda until the 3rd act. The script could have used a few more rewrites as it was rather stunted and unnatural. The acting was weak, particularly Keanu's. On the plus side, the special effects were good (not spectacular, but good), and the cinematography was very good.Here is my chief complaint: Alice Eve cast as Keanu Reeves' wife?? With a teenage daughter??? Did they meet while Keanu was babysitting her, and she had their first child when she was 15 years old? Ms Eve looks more like Reeves' daughter, not wife. I looked up their ages, and she is 18 years younger than Reeves. I know movies have had more heinous age differences, but Eve looks like she should still be playing 20 year olds (kudos to her!). Add to the fact that she and Reeves had zero chemistry. Shame on the director, Jeffrey Nachmanoff, who is obviously threatened by an strong, age-appropriate female. His ideas about female roles couldn't be more obvious if he had dressed the young actress in a cheerleaders uniform.",Replicas

Some scenes are creatively shot and lit - though these scenes are few and far between - and at times the score can be decent. And Thomas Middleditch's performance is actually alright.Do I sound vague? That's because there's honestly nothing more I can say about this film, because the rest of it is god awful. I like Keanu Reeves as an actor but somehow in this film he's nothing more than a hunk of word that occasionally spouts science terminology and pouts. A lot of the other actors are no better.
Awful acting aside, this film is quite literally a compendium of every single sci-fi film on the planet. If can think of anything to do with sci-fi, quite literally anything at all, it's in this film. Robots? Check. Cyborgs? Check. Cloning? Check. Holograms? Check. Question the ethics of science? Check. There are many more clichés but I'd be touching spoiler territory if I listed them all. And I'm sure you already get the point. It gets to a point where you just tune yourself out of the film because you already know what's going happen. It's boring beyond belief and yet somehow so frustrating with its lack of creativity.Honestly, it's so hard to write anything about this film because there's nothing to talk about. It's boring, it's annoying, it's nothing new, and you'd be better off avoiding it.",Replicas
374,somersaultclemency,New Approach: Robots Do Not Necessarily Have to BE ENEMIES!,8,19 January 2019,"I wasn't expecting this much from the movie when I first decided to see it. However, Keanu once more proved that he is a flawless actor and he was very suitable for this role. The movie was quite realistic and conciving except for the exaggerations at some scenes. The plot reminded me of Frankenstein but on a different level.Bill (Keanu Reeves) was the creator of the 3 monsters (his family members) and he didn't only settle with this result, but he also brought a new approach to what is called new life in a robotic body. Bill actually replicated himself into a machine so to speak. However, on the contrary to the belief that robots will be enemies of the human beings, the movie brought a new perspective about turning technology into some kind of an emotional bond between humans and robots. Therefore, the movie reflected the idea that the synthetic future does not have to be completely separated from the emotional, on the contrary it can be adapted to humane emotions and morals. Moreover, it approached the technology in a realistic way in terms of combining good and evil between robots and humans and reflecting them with flaws and fragility.To sum up, the movie was deeper than I expected it to be. It reminded me of Gertrude Stein's ""A rose is a rose is a rose..."" idea, and Marilyn Manson's ""You are just a copy of an immitation"" notion. So in a way, deep down the message was to reflect and express the fact that you do not need to become a machine in order to be counted as ""replica"" as you already are an immitation of an immitation.",Replicas

And no one mentioned it. Or a bank heist movie where they played animated cartoons over the security cameras, and the security guards just watched the cartoons and never triggered the alarm. You would go... what? That makes no sense. Why is this happening? How is this happening? Is this some alternate universe where logic and consequences have no meaning?It's as if the writer/s were either incapable of writing their way out of the corner they painted themselves into, or just didn't care to bother.

First off... they bit off a bit more than they could chew by having him revive his entire family. This movie could be cool if like... you know... it was just him and his wife... and she died in the accident and he had to revive her.The problem is having to account for 4 human being's just suddenly disappearing for weeks. Oh the kids are now home schooled? Sure. What excuse did he make for his wife missing from work again? Did nobody else in the world know who Zoe was? Like what happens when the school asks the wife what happened to her youngest daughter? You can't just erase a human from existence even if they are just a child. They don't have like... other family that knows about her? No cousins? Uncles? Aunts? Neighbors?Like if it was just the wife missing for a few weeks he could cover that up pretty easily. Oh she had a bad illness and needed to recover. Then write off her lack of memory to her just sleeping through it or something.But he doesn't even bother to think about how he's going to erase this child from the house... all the family photos, sure he trashed those... but isn't his wife going to wonder why there's all these empty spots where pictures were clearly hanging on the walls? The kids clearly have social media... did he scour all of their social media and the internet for any mention of Zoe or photos she might be tagged in or exist in? I doubt it.So sure, we can just say he figured he'd have to tell them eventually. I can almost look past all of that, but then the movie just gets really dumb as it continues. The whole reveal that the company knew all along, and that they are ""evil"" and then the ridiculous hitmen wearing sunglasses and ponytails feels like it's straight out of a Disney Channel Original Movie.I was honestly hoping the movie would go in a more interesting direction with the wife and kids... Like they hinted at something not being quite ""right"" when they first woke up. The boy was absentmindedly making messes... they were ingesting a ton of food, the wife had a moment while running where she didn't feel ""right"".That could have snowballed as they progressively got worse... Maybe the son just starts losing control of his body or something. Maybe the wife becomes mentally unstable. I was kind of hoping she'd lose it and try to kill herself like the original robot did when it figured out it wasn't real. I dunno... anything would have been better than the direction of ""the company is bad and now we have to run!""The ending was even goofier with him and his family magically being safe now on a beach somewhere... somehow the wife totally remembers the completely deleted child she once had... I guess he did some magic with their brains to un-delete memories? What happened to the evil boss? He got cloned and now is reprogrammed I'm assuming to assist in making... money for some reason? I guess the family gets some of that money to live or whatever, but... didn't the evil boss say they'd send more people after him? What happened to that?The movie ends like everything is great, and all plot holes have been wrapped up, but it just leaves me asking way more questions.I wanted to see more aspects of... realizing you're a clone... realizing you died, all of that. The wife's performance after coming back was so odd... It's like someone told her to act like an emotionless robot. She would still be like... emotional right? After her whole talk about him crossing the line with a robot she was just like ""oh you cloned me and the kids and we died? Well... I'm mad but hey, who can stay mad at you, Keanu?""",Replicas

A very good effort by the creators of the film! I recommend watching the movie!",Replicas

411,oliveruschmann,A flick that should've been a show,4,1 November 2019,"I'm saying this with all my love for Keanu Reeves, whose acting is regularly underrated by all the know-it-alls: This movie doesn't function at all. Although it has so much potential! The motivations are plausible, the emotional stakes are high and the story is an acceptable interpretation of the classical ""mad professor""-motif. But the whole plot around the technology itself, the company which produces it and all the ethical and philosophical questions which rise around this cannot be worked out in a movie. At least not like that. Within the 107 minutes running time of this flick it becomes an unplausible, overhasty and clichéd construction. But: It could all be very well worked out within a show of 8, or better, of 16 episodes! ""Replicas"" demonstrates the main problem of storytelling in movies today - as we all got used of the brillant, slow-paced but substantial world-building of good shows, most movies can't keep up with that standards anymore.",Replicas

413,dakotadarkfire,Good Sci-Fi with some interesting ethical questions,7,1 January 2019,I think this is a great Sci-Fi flick that brings to light some very interesting questions. It is not a 10 star film by any means and Keanu Reeves is not at his best. In fact I could feel very little emotion from Keanu in this film and longed for his Matrix days as an actor.However that aside the film brings to light some very interesting ethical questions we might some day have to ask ourselves. It also shines a light on things not yet thought of when someone goes down the road of copying themselves into artificial bodies whether biological or not.In the end I did manage to enjoy the movie and look at it from a technological point of view. I also felt that everyone in the film was more believable then Reeves who seems to have lost his touch with age. Reeves fans might need to skip this one but for Sci-Fi fans its a must.,Replicas

The loving father had to make a decision which was to bring the family back to life. And then the sorrows and pains that comes with finding out the truth ..ensues.The premise of the story was a sad, intriguing, ethical, and lots of other thing combined. The execution and direction it took to plot this out could've went a better route.I was hoping that the protagonist would have had revived his family in a more legitimate way instead of lying. The cover up and lies gave openings to the plot to turn the story into an action pack drama with killers and sadistic hedge fund sociopath. I had rather instead of going that route, they could've went into the ethical version, explore the tragedy and pain of the truth iltegarding being revived as a replica in the family. That would've been sad and heart wrenching.Anyways - turning the businessmen into a killer with his cronies was just offsetting to what could've been a great ""thinking"" movie.Explore the ethical questions, explore the family's take on finding out the truth, explore what happens when this scenario becomes public. How does society react to it? Things like that.I thought about how sad it would be to lose a family abs having to revive them into clones. Knowing they're not themselves, not the original. The replicas are another person who look, think, and act like the original. Very sad and intriguing.A somewhat wasted potential.

If (big if) you like Keanu Reeves (of course); if you like Tarentino flix; if you like ""hard sci-fi""; like interesting family pix; like ""what if"" stories ... this may be a pic for you. That's quite a mix but I thought the script, the director, the actors, all pulled it off very well. I saw it with not much in the way of expectations: mostly went because it was a Keanu Reeves movie. Turned out to be a good Keanu Reeves movie even tho a bit different for him. The ""what if"" features were great. I like a movie that actually has an interesting story, and this definitely has one; and one of my favorite kinds of stories comprise those in the wide range of ""what if"" stories that include sci-fi. Like any good Tarentino movie, it's full of salutes to cool B movies of the past, combines deeply moving, comedic, and stylized features; and is so free of artsy hi-brow ostentation. Also believe it or not this is really a very cool family movie. We need more movies that can deal with some tough family challenges and play out the ""what ifs"" of life in humane and believable ways. Oh and on top of everything else: there are some cool Jason Bourne type sequences and Bourne music tributes at Bourne-like moments ... very awesome IMHO but then I enjoy tributes like those. Likewise, there were cool ""I Robot"" elements - very appropriate and very well handled. All in all: think Tarentino-does-SF is a good description of this movie.

Although this story is fictional, in his real life, he has been through some of the grief and loss that occurs early in this film that for me made his performance very believable. It also might be as a parent, that I can relate to his ethical dilemmas as well. I also don't want to give spoilers, but I think scientists and mathematicians may come closer and closer to the viability of this at some point in the future, and for me that made this a psychological thriller to think about a combination of intelligence, science, and love for humanity.

So many people have called Replicas a terrible movie filled with plot holes and inconsistencies but I ask you, above all, have you ever seen films like A Quiet Place or Looper? I mean, come on, they may have been entertaining to an extent, but they're filled with so many holes that I can barely even count them on my fingers. In Replicas, however, there are around 2-3 logical issues, depending on your view on rationality. Sure, the acting may have not been the best (other than Keanu Reeves, of course) and the CGI wasn't unbelievably good, but you can't be putting blockbuster standards on an indie film. For me, the story is the most important thing for a film and this one (for the most part) nailed it. If, for example, the acting is amazing, but the story is trash, then what's the point of watching a film like that? If you think Replicas' story is absurd, then watch Bill and Ted Face The Music (which is also PG-13, by the way), see if you'll like it and hopefully, like me, you will.",Replicas

Should you grow a person synthetically and then program memories into them? Would they want to come back? There is a certain magic with a movie like this. It's pure entertainment. You might like the movie, but more than likely you will enjoy laughing at the cheesiness of this move. Disclaimer : Also baked while writing this review. Not sure if any of this applies if you aren't baked. Maybe it's not even watchable. It's also funny watching Kuno Reeves from the amazing movie that was the matrix From 1999 Star in this laughable sci fi. I know I spelled his name wrong.

They have her children in another room and when Keanu Reeves asks her where the kids are, she just nonchalantly says, oh they're OK, they're in the other room.

It had humor and wasn't scary or suspenseful, which I assumed it would be given it involves cloning his family. So if you are looking for a thriller, this isn't it. But if you want to watch a movie with Keanu Reeves that isn't scary, this is certainly worth watching. Also, you cannot overthink this - or think at all actually - because it falls apart.

Its very hard to relate to their ways of acting and reactions.
This all aside from how bad the dialogues are. I was facepalming through this movie frequently at all the stupid stuff that was said.
Especially when Keanu was trying to explain his scientific train of thought to the viewers, or how he reacted after a car crash with this family. Then Alice who suddenly goes questioning Keanu's morals about cloning, his lifework, after all these years. On barely any grounds at all. Her dialogues were the most unrealistic. And then the showcase of the worst evil villain in 21st century movies, John. His ""sudden"" overseeing masterplan is just a joke and his motives are just not logical.The pace of the story and timeline are also laughable. Keanu suddenly being surprised by how the cloning process works, even though he is the lead science guy in the department. Next thing you know it there are 3 clones being grown in his basement. The car chases, with armed men going after a family who somehow outrun, outdrive and outsmart the guards is plain stupid.The movie tries to create some scientific background to cloning and braintransfers and tries to make it look cool with the insensible HUD driven computersystem, which is not believable at all.Music, least worst of all, but can't really save this.I can keep ranting on and on, here's just a little taste of how bad this was.

This is the case with most cult classics. They are not really appreciated until years later. Here is an opportunity to watch a cult classics in the making...",Replicas

549,andy_renda,Great B-Film,8,18 January 2019,"This is a fun pulpy science fiction film, it has cult classic written all over it. It obviously had a limited budget and the pace of the movie is a little odd, that being said I enjoyed it thoroughly.",Replicas
550,neontetrafilms,This... is extraordinarily bad,1,22 December 2018,"I honestly just don't know where to begin. I think I'm just going to ask... how did a script like this get made. How. This is beyond mind boggling. A script so incredibly bad that it brings down pretty cool production design, cinematography and acting to an embarrassing level. This quite literally feels like a 5 year old child wanted to write a science fiction movie. Everything about the story, the dialog, the sci fi conceptual framework, it was all written horribly. Wish I could be more positive here and forgiving like I am with nearly every movie I see but this was confusingly bad. I don't understand how a script in this condition could possibly get made. Keanu Reeves and the production team are certainly not at fault here, they did what they could with such an embarrassingly bad story.",Replicas
551,aewius,Worst movie Keanu made in 20 years,2,24 January 2019,"Worst movie Keanu made in 20 years . It has something from all of his movies and from personal life , but what it does not have is a plot , do not watch waste of time",Replicas
552,uberfasih,I loved this movie,9,23 December 2018,"I liked the story of a father trying his best to save his family, not aware of the consequences ahead. The use of special effects was ok, other elements like cloning and technology to map mind and memories was good too.",Replicas
553,calejandro-80522,Excellent movie. Unfortunately not everyone understands it.,10,28 July 2019,"People who low rated this movie is probably just because they didn't understand it. They probably focus in minor details because they were not understanding what was really happening. So, the natural response of the human against something that they don't understand is the rejection.",Replicas
554,riverschimney,Bill & Ed's Not-So-Excellent Adventure,4,1 October 2019,"Yes, in a tongue-in-cheek twist, Keanu's character name is Bill and his sidekick is Ed and they embark on an adventure that is overwhelmingly subpar. Come on, guys! We all knew what we were getting into when we decided to watch this movie! It's worth watching just to make fun of. Although, I did only make it halfway through before I went to bed. I'll let you know if the last half redeems it in any way.",Replicas

What would you do if you lost your family in one night
Answer, You would do anything to have them back
That's what a Mad scientist would do
Yes, we are all mad when it comes to Family
They are who makes us and what we are
We love them we hate them, yet we can't live without them
That's what this movie is about,
Thanks Keanu, great story-line and evasive thinking",Replicas

It was a story about complex endeavors and needed to be told in an abbreviated manner to fit into a movie format. I watched the trailer and ignored the low score. Very enjoyable...",Replicas

560,contactshalon,Terrible movie!,2,9 January 2019,"I viewed this as an early release event. The writing, directing and acting was sub-par. There were so many glaring plot mistakes that it appears to have been thrown together by a bunch of amateurs. I could not suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy it because there were just too many stupidly glaring problems to overcome.",Replicas
561,gilbertlopezrios,In the bowels of tomorrow keanu reeves,10,5 November 2018,"Replicas tries to insert itself in the dynamics of the moral stories about the ethical correctness of science.
The demential story of Replicas is about the loss that leads to extreme measures that precipitate the fall to the abyss but unleashing the intellectual capacities to the maximum and, incidentally, surprising when giving the right weight to the accident in scientific experimentation.",Replicas
562,jordeinternational,Let's talk about deep emotional mood...,10,7 November 2018,"In the vein of other richly depressing worlds created in cinema, this movie can bring you to real sadness. A man loses his family... Darkness... Obsession... Serious mood.From start to finish I felt the weight. I found his characters solution to be smart and eventually heroic, yet the darkness never left the screen.Like ""Black Moon Rising"" ""Runaway"" ""Terminator 2"" ""Lawnmower Man"" and ""Brainscan"" .... This film will really pull you in with the cold dark mood. If you connect with that then you will see a piece of high art that only a few films can become, where the story is so real and close to life because the ""fiction"" of the story is truly so close to our world that it comes across more as a documentary than a fantasy.Acting was great. Lighting was the real star... Or rather lack of it.... Use of shadows was top form. The logic of science was present. And the driven pulse of a desperate man fueled the scenes... The ending was worth the wait.10",Replicas
563,parijsiszoleuk,OMG,2,4 December 2018,"What a terrible movie... The story sucks in itself. But Keanu does a great job making it even worse. We went to the sneak preview, so we watched it with a discount, but I kind of feel like I should have been paid to watch this 😂",Replicas
564,antigap,Very Dark Movie...,2,26 December 2018,"Frankly I was disappointed from this movie and the message it tries to spread out and commune to our society. Since this movie was not specifically designed solely for entertainment purposes but with a specific agenda. Any sentient being, even a half brain can I believe see this when watching this movie.Thus it degrades humans to simple neurochemical connections, one more device that can be manipulated like your smart phone or computer and replicated with science, trying to remove any ethical barriers from our society on this matter, defying death reality and ""promoting"" humans as Gods or else superhumans.A quite disgusting and disturbing display of what some of the entertainment industry has become today.Besides that the movie was technically excellent and acting was great, specially by Keanu, which however I despise for his decision to take part in this damaging movie, I would expect better from him.The movie has a PG-13 rating although in my opinion it should be PG-18.In an nutshell, If you self aware of the above mentioned go watch the movie to see for your self but keep your young people away from it.",Replicas

This wouldn't even have made a good TV movie. Mind boggling to think more than one adult watched this and thought yeah let's put this on the big screen. Do yourself a favor....clip your toenails, organize your cabinets, or finally get around to some early spring cleaning. All would be better options than wasting 2 hours of your short life in this drivel and that's putting it mildly.",Replicas

569,cornojansen,What a ghastly movie,1,5 January 2019,"I never have done any review on IMDB for any movie, but today i felt to urge to create an account after i saw this movie.I personally believe the Matrix and The day the earth stood still are quite good movies and Keanu portrays believable characters in compelling stories.I haven't watched the John Wick movies just yet, and I just decided it will be the last chance I will give Keanu since every single other movie i have watched in recent years in which he starred were either mediocre or just plain amateuristic. His acting has gone bad somehow:wooden charactersplotholes the size of the Grand Canyonstoryline that indeed isn't predictable , l ll give it that, but then again this flick doesn't make any freaking sense at alla movie that has such a fast pace you start thinking that the first 45 min portrays a back story and the best is still to comeit never comesThis story is a waste of everybody's time, I just wasted another 15 minutes to it, just trying to make sure nobody is going to watch it.Every rating higher than a 2 is written by either a family member of the cast and crew or gets paid for it.Worst thing I have ever seen in my life!",Replicas
570,tonerivera,This was bad!!!,1,9 January 2019,1st the cast n script was horrible..the things that main character did after his family died in an automobile accident is unbelievable. He didnt mourn..then told his science partner to get rid of his dead family bodies..lol..really????? This movie is morally wrong..n you shouldnt waste your time on it..unless you have nothing else to do..,Replicas
571,erikweston,Terrible,1,11 January 2019,This movie was absolutely terrible. I have no idea why this movie is being released In theatres. The plot is so filed with holes it's ridiculous. Keanu turns in an awful performance. Alice Eve is no better. Even if you have A-List or another subscription service don't waste one of your films on this one.,Replicas

I didn't have an imdb account and made one with the sole purpose of warning other people to not go see this piece of crap.
And I tried to give this movie a chance I went in blank but my God was it boring. You don't care about any of the characters the plot is super predictable and the acting is horrendous.
Don't get me wrong I love terrible movies, like the byebye man and even movies like skyscraper get a pass, but this abomination isn't even so bad it's entertaining/hilarious...
I'm serious watching paint dry will be more entertaining.
For all I care visit your grandma or goldfish or your pet rock for two hours it will be more entertaining.
Its just a bad and boring movie.
No fun.
Trust me just don't go see it.",Replicas
