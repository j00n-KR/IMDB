0,MartinHafer,"A slow, gentle sort of road picture.",8,12 October 2021,"""Cry Macho"" is a pretty amazing film that in some ways reminds me of ""Mackintosh and T. J."", Roy Rogers' last movie that he made when he was elderly. Both films are about aging cowboys who befriend kids who are about 13 and both have a very slow and deliberate pace....which is all you really should expect from aging actors.Clint Eastwood directed and stars in this story. It begins with Mike (Eastwood) being asked by his boss (Dwight Yoakim) to go to Mexico City to bring back the boss' 13 year-old son who has been living off and on with his mother. I saw off and on because the boy often just wanders the streets because the abuse is so bad at home. The mother, at first, agrees to let Mike take the kid but later she changes her mind...apparently just to be a jerk! But because of the abuse, Mike takes the boy north...which isn't an easy thing because the mother is rich and has thugs looking for Mike and the kid. To make it worse, the kid is very street-wise and wild...and it seems doubtful he'll stay with Mike for long.The film seems like at times there isn't much in the way of script....just a lot of small talk and small moments. This is NOT a complaint...and I actually liked these moments. The acting and direction really helped to carry the movie for me.By the way, the film was not actually filmed in Mexico but in New Mexico...near Albuquerque (in Belen and Polvadera) .",Cry Macho
1,boblipton,I Was Disappointed,5,18 September 2021,"Clint Easwood is an old man, his career as a champion rodeo rider long vanished with a busted back, his wife and child decades dead in a car wreck. One day, Dwight Yoakum shows up and points out Eastwood owes him. He wants Eastwood to go down to Mexico City, where his 13-year-old son is living with his ex-wife. Bring the boy to the border, and they'll call it even. After some back and forth, Eastwood does. He discovers the situation is not as Yoakum portrayed it, but close enough. He talks the boy, Eduardo Minett into coming north, and they start an erratic road trip, pursued by the ex-wife's goons, back to the US border, accompanied by Minett's fighting bantam.The problems with this movie are sizable, and they come down to the two leads. Clint Eastwood can't move with any sense of strength. He's in his 90s, and he walks like he's about to fall down and shatter into a million pieces. As for Minett, he delivers every line in English like he is laboriously translating it. That's probably not a bad decision for how a real person might speak, but for a lead role in what is essentially a buddy road movie, it palls very quickly.Even with those two key flaws, I had a good time. Eastwood's line delivery is simple and elegant, the story makes a good deal of sense, both emotionally and in terms of character development, and Ben Davis' shooting of the high country in New Mexico as background, is quite lovely.Given Eastwood's remarkable five-decade run as a director, including his last five all being great, it would have been nice to lengthen the string. However, the miscasting, and particularly Minett's awful acting choice -- or perhaps it was a directorial order -- make this one only watchable.",Cry Macho
2,nogodnomasters,Take him,4,30 September 2021,"The film takes place in 1979. Mike Milo (Clint Eastwood) is a washed up cowboy who had a bad rodeo fall. He is requested by a former boss to retrieve his son (Eduardo Minett) from his abusive mother in Mexico. He offers his son life on a big ranch with horses. The hobbling Milo manages to convince the son to come with him. Mom sends out goons to get him back. Most of the film consists of the two guys sitting and eating in a cantina off the main road.I was thoroughly bored. It is nice to see that Eastwood finally sits in chairs as opposed to talking to them, although it may have more entertaining the other way.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Cry Macho
3,classicsoncall,"""Look where you're goin', and go where you're lookin'.""",8,18 September 2021,"As a Clint Eastwood fan, I keep looking for another film in the same league as ""Unforgiven"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", or ""Gran Torino"", but if the only pictures we get are those like ""Trouble With the Curve"", ""The Mule"" and this one, ""Cry Macho"", I'll still be a happy camper. And I don't use the word 'only' in a negative sense. The aging, or maybe I should say, aged actor, is still capable of producing entertaining and meaningful pictures now into his Nineties, and that is a mean feat for anyone. There's a scene in the picture where a Mexican woman brings a dog to Eastwood's character Mike Milo because he has a reputation for being good with animals. In an aside to young Rafo (Eduardo Minett), Mike says that he 'can't cure old'. I'm pretty sure that was Eastwood's way of describing the way he sees himself in a young person's world, making movies that appeal to his sense of good story telling without resorting to insane car chases and mind numbing explosions.The movie in a way pays tribute to Eastwood's career as a Western TV and movie star, citing his character's status as a former champion rodeo rider, laid low by a career ending injury and the death of his wife and son many years prior. By returning a thirteen year old boy from Mexico back to his father in Texas, Mike Milo finds a sense of redemption to his wayward life as a ranch hand for Howard Polk (Dwight Yoakam). Their relationship grows throughout the journey, interrupted at one point when the father's hidden intentions are suddenly made known. The distrust this creates on the part of Rafo is slowly eroded by Mike's patient handling of the boy, along with the influence of a café and saloon owner who takes an interest in Mike. The age disparity between the two initially works against the idea of a romance, but the skillful handling of Eastwood's directorial hand eventually makes it seem credible. My favorite scenes were those in which Mike and Rafo mingled with Marta (Natalia Traven) and her surrogate daughters, taken in when Marta's sister passed away. They're humorous and charming in a way that helps Mike understand how much he's valued by coming into their life.The 'macho' theme is consistently raised throughout the story, as all throughout, Mike by his words and actions, attempts to teach Rafo that being macho doesn't always have to mean being manly and strong, that it's alright to be emotional when situations warrant. Adding further resonance to the title of the picture, Rafo's pet rooster is named Macho, raised by the boy from a weak bird into a rugged cockfighting warrior. The rooster earns his wings so to speak, when he intervenes at a critical point with the strongarm thug sent by Rafo's mother (Fernanda Urrejola) to retrieve the boy back to Mexico. Successfully emerging from that altercation, the story ends with Rafo's reuniting with his father, although to be honest, it comes as sort of an underwhelming reconciliation. One's expectation is that the moment would be more of a triumph, although Mike's return to the little village which Marta calls home was to be fully anticipated. It brought to fruition what Mike once said to Rafo while on the road, and quoted in my summary line above.",Cry Macho
4,searchanddestroy-1,Eastwood about Eastwood by Eastwood starring Eastwood,6,10 November 2021,"You have to be a die hard fan of Clint Eastwood, very very die hard buff of this icon of the movie industry to really appreciate this film where there is no surprise at all, unless you have never seen a movie with Eastwood as an actor. The directing and acting, of course, as usual with him, are flawless, I would say awesome, but sooo predictable. You can also see it as a kind of testament feature, as if he knew that it would be his last performance, at the age of 91. A kind of summary of his life and career. Some poignant moments between him and the young boy, no one could deny it. But for me it remains a film with, for and only about Eastwood. I will never say it's a bad film, no, but that's exactly what I was afraid of. Because I have never liked this actor, nearly always the same kinds of characters; ALWAYS. But he is a legend, a myth of the movie history. And an awesome director too, gifted, sensitive, unique.",Cry Macho
5,zardoz-13,Clint's Back!!!,8,25 September 2021,"Most Hollywood superstars aren't around long enough to topline as well as produce and direct their own films after celebrating their 90th birthday. Indisputably, Clint Eastwood is the exception. The ""Rawhide"" TV star filmed ""Cry Macho"" during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with New Mexico standing in for Mexico. Not surprisingly, ""Cry Macho"" may contain Clint's final words on the subject of machismo. At one point, Clint's character complains, ""This macho thing is overrated. Just people trying to show that they've got grit. That's about all they end up with. It's like anything else in life: you think you got all the answers, then you realize, as you get older, you don't have any of them."" Front and center most of the time, Clint displays considerable physical agility for what this role demanded of the 90-year-old star. When he isn't cruising in vintage automobiles, he sits tall in the saddle and reminds us he punched Hollywood steers for eight seasons on CBS-TV's ""Rawhide"" from 1959 to 1966. He still makes a cowboy hat look good above his wizened scowl. Violence is held to a minimum in this laid-back, neo-western, but Eastwood also orchestrates it in ways you would least imagine. For the record, he does sucker punch one bad guy. However, he doesn't shoot anybody in the eye. At the same time, Clint corralled Albert S. Ruddy as a co-producer. A seasoned Hollywood veteran, Ruddy produced both versions of ""The Longest Yard"" (1974 & 2005) with Burt Reynolds as well as ""The Cannonball Run"" (1981), and Clint's Oscar-winning girl-fight epic ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004). Ruddy's claim either to fame or infamy is as producer of ""The Godfather"" trilogy (1972, 1974, & 1990). Meantime, Clint doesn't cut himself any slack in this 104-minute, PG-rated, picaresque yarn about a broken-down rodeo rider who crosses the border to find his boss man's son and bring him home. Indeed, this constitutes a journey of hardship with our hero escorting an unruly teen and his game fighting rooster. Comparisons between the recent Liam Neeson road trip ""The Marksman"" are inevitable, but ""Cry Macho"" stands its own ground and engenders greater feelings of optimism at fadeout.""Cry Macho"" takes place between the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Michael Milo (Clint Eastwood of ""Unforgiven"") is a washed-up rodeo champ who has weathered his share of hard times. Not only did he break his back when a horse threw him at a rodeo, but he also lost his wife and son in a tragic auto accident. He squandered everything in his abysmal grief and relied on the charity of his few and far-between friends. Now, his friend and former boss Howard Polk (Dwight Yoakam of ""Sling Blade"") asks him to drive down to Mexico City and return with his 13-year-old son, Rafael (newcomer Eduardo Minett), so the latter can live with him on his sprawling ranch. Shifty-eyed Howard doesn't tell Milo that he dispatched two younger guys earlier to do the job. Neither made it back. First thing Milo does after he agrees reluctantly to embark on this odyssey is head straight to Mexico City in a late-model Chevy truck to see Howard's tempestuous ex-wife. Neither Howard nor Leta can stand the sight of each other, and Howard fears he would be incarcerated if he sets foot across the border. Turns out Rafael spends more time on the streets than he does with Leta in her palatial estate where the parties never cease. Leta (Fernanda Urrejola of ""Bring Me The Head of the Machine Gun Woman"") suspects Rafael frequents underground cock-fighting arenas. She sends two of her bodyguards to shadow Milo, but he eludes them. Milo ambles into one cock-fighting arena moments before the dreaded Federale Police raid it. Barely escaping arrest himself, Milo lucks up and finds Rafael hiding nearby with his fighting cock rooster named Macho. Milo is surprised when Rafael is eager to accompany him back to Texas. What neither realizes is they will become the object of a widespread manhunt because not only Leta but also the Federales want them. When they aren't dodging Leta's henchmen and the police, our heroes tangle with car thieves. The road back to Texas is no picnic. They encounter obstacles from the get-go and things grow even more complicated before Milo turns Rafael over to Howard. Ironically, the most surprising thing for Milo is his snake-bitten luck changes drastically when Rafael and he encounter a wise widow and her brood of motherless grandchildren.""Cry Macho"" benefits tremendously from British cinematographer Ben Davis's virtuoso lensing. Davis shot both ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) and ""Captain Marvel"" (2019). He makes the Mexican landscape look spectacular but forbidding. Moments arise when you can forget about the plot and savor the sentiments of the moment. For example, Milo races past a pasture and watches as a herd of galloping quarter horses gallop alongside him. ""Grand Torino"" scenarist Nick Schenk adapted N. Richard Nash's novel ""Cry Macho"" for Eastwood. The novel is far bleaker than the film. Just to show you the tortured trajectory some literary properties endure, Nash wrote his book as a screenplay initially, but 20th Century Fox turned it down in the 1970s. Later, he converted it into a novel. ""Jaws"" star Roy Scheider tried to make it in 1991, but the project lacked momentum. Similarly, Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted it as his comeback picture in 2011 after he finished his term as California's governor. Eastwood himself had a crack at it in 1988 but wound up making ""The Dead Pool"" (1988), the fifth ""Dirty Harry"" feature film. Earlier, Eastwood had expressed interest in helming it with actor Robert Mitchum who had starred in the neo-western rodeo epic ""The Lusty Men"" (1952). Whether Eastwood keeps on starring in his own movies or not remains to be seen. All in all, the predictable but entertaining ""Cry Macho"" captures the venerable spirit of those Saturday Evening Post magazine covers painted by Norman Rockwell about American culture in the 1930s.",Cry Macho

While the bare bones of the adaptation by Nick Schenk & N.

7,deloudelouvain,I was hoping for better coming from Clint Eastwood.,6,18 October 2021,"I think it's time for Clint Eastwood to enjoy his last years on earth in all tranquility and leave cinema forever. I love Clint Eastwood, as an actor and even more as a producer but Cry Macho is maybe the movie too much. The whole thing is too slow, kinda boring to be honest, and with actors that were not that great. I'm thinking about that kid played by Eduardo Minett which annoying to listen to, and the woman playing Martha wasn't that great either. The cinematography was good on the other hand, but that's not good enough to make Cry Macho standing out. We're used of much better from Clint Eastwood.

10,Cineanalyst,Eastwood Continues to Get Mileage Out of His Macho Image,5,17 September 2021,"I assume when one is 90 years old (and since turned 91), there isn't much to do but look back, most of their life behind them. Most don't make it that far, although director-star Clint Eastwood has been playing on his iconic image created by a past oeuvre for some time now--at least since ""Unforgiven"" (1992), made when he was just a sexagenarian whippersnapper, and especially since he inverted even the image of that film and masculine persona in ""Gran Torino"" (2008). Remember when critics were speculating that'd be his last performance on screen? That was almost thirteen years ago, and this, ""Cry Macho,"" is his third starring role since. All of those, including besides this one, ""Trouble with the Curve"" (2012) and ""The Mule"" (2018), are road trips of one sort or another concerning his coming to terms with his past and with a new generation as he continues his craft--whether baseball scouting, horticulture, or cowboying--long past the time people expected him to.Far be it from me, then, to ponder whether this will be his last rodeo. I hope he keeps going, although it may be best if he hangs up the actual saddle, as it's too suspenseful merely to see a man of his age, hunched forward, shuffling gait, hand tremors an' all, on horseback, and the old tricks (distanced camera, low-key lighting, quick cuts, head down) to substitute a stunt double during the horse bucking are obvious. Ditto the unbelievable physical confrontations with young men or teenagers. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro (""The Irishman"" (2019)) and the MCU and Samuel L. Jackson (""Captain Marvel"" (2019)) couldn't entirely convincingly pull off old men throwing punches and stomping bodies with all the CGI in the world and some concealing edits won't manage it, either. It's wonderful--inspiring even--to see actors of advancing years continue in such starring roles, but if you're 90 years old, perhaps act like you're 90 years old. It's hard enough as it is even with pharmaceutical advancements to buy a nonagenarian being of sexual interest to women up to a third that age.Maybe that'll be another aspect of his macho image to deconstruct for the next road trip (although he rather did so already in ""The Mule,"" on both accounts). This one does away, however, with the politically-incorrect humor of ""Gran Torino"" and ""The Mule,"" among others. Eastwood making fun of the wordplay of the boy naming his, er, rooster ""Macho"" doesn't come close. Whether this absence is just playing the character, as based on a novel, part of the picture's calculated unraveling of the machismo, a continuation of such surely would've been met with increased controversy nowadays and for a narrative that is about reconsidering masculinity for a younger generation.Much like the relationship between Eastwood's cowboy and the son of his former boss, ""Cry Macho"" is a bit awkward and a tough-go at first, although I appreciate the business with the news clippings on the wall extolling this version of Eastwood's past rodeo glory and how his downfall is rendered as a photograph-turned-motion picture. As well, their charms do eventually make for a breezy, neo-Western road trip in Eastwood's characteristically economical filmmaking style, especially after they settle down for a while in a sleepy, Mexican border town, although it'd hardly be of any interest without the great cinematic past that Eastwood brings to it.",Cry Macho
11,Thanos_Alfie,I liked it...,6,9 October 2021,"""Cry Macho"" is a Drama - Western movie in which we watch a former rodeo star going from Texas to Mexico City to take and save the son of a friend of his fro his alcoholic mother. On their journey they face many difficulties and obstacles but they have to surpass them in order to reach their destination.I have to admit that I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and his movies so, I had high expectations from this movie. Despite its simple plot Clint Eastwood who directed and produced this movie presented it in a very good way without creating any confusion or plot holes. His interpretation was also very good as Mike Milo and he succeeded on presenting the bond that was created between him and Eduardo Minett who played as Rafo. In addition to this, I have to admit that I enjoyed the interpretation of Eduardo Minett and I cannot understand why some people in the reviews say that he was not good at all. Lastly, I have to say that ""Cry Macho"" is a nice movie and I recommend everyone to watch it especially the fans of Clint Eastwood. I am not saying that ""Cry Macho"" is the best movie of his but another good movie to spend your time with.",Cry Macho
12,cruise01,Decent western drama that is slow and empty.,6,21 September 2021,3 out of 5 stars.Cry Macho is a fair western drama film that follows Clint Eastwood who is a burnt out rodeo star. Giving one task to go to Mexico to bring back his boss teenage son. Which turns out to be a long road trip when him and the kid come across roadblocks.Decent plot. The film does have some great characterization with Clint and that teenage boy. As they are learning from each other.It is what you can expect from a Clint Eastwood movie. It is slow moving. Great acting with the cast. Decent story. And the script does not offer anything else with the journey these characters are going through. Not much happens throughout the film which can be boring when these characters dont face any challenges or conflict. Besides being a long road trip movie.,Cry Macho
13,zkonedog,All Caricature & Little Substance,3,19 September 2021,"Despite a few duds--Richard Jewell & The Mule--of late, the aura of Clint Eastwood (especially now as a nonagenarian!) is still enough to get me into the theater to see his works. Unfortunately, while Cry Macho isn't abjectly bad, it is far from great--or even good, really--due to its caricature approach to character, setting, and themes.For a very basic overview, Cry Macho tells the story of Mike Milo (Eastwood), an age-appropriate ranch hand sent to Mexico to retrieve the estranged teenaged son (Eduardo Minett) of ranch owner Howard Polk (Dwight Yoakam). En route, Mike and the boy both learn a little about each other from their romp through Mexico.The good news about Cry Macho? It isn't Eastwood wagging his finger at the younger generation (like in The Mule) or wearing his politics on his sleeve. No, here things are played pretty straight down the middle. Just seeing a 91-year old individual act is in part admirable, and there are a few solid cinematic shots or moments along the way.The easily-identifiable problem in Cry Macho, however, is that nearly every character or scene is a caricature of the real thing. In other words, every interesting nugget is given no more than lip service and never really shown or developed in any meaningful way.A few examples include:-The father/son relationship the whole premise is building towards? Absolutely no payoff whatsoever.-The son in question? Touted as a ""rough kid"", but once met is little more than flip-flopping between comically recalcitrant or moony-eyed over Mike's exploits.-The portrayal of Mexico? As overly simplified as it can get.Even Eastwood himself is essentially playing a caricature mashup, if you will, of performances both young and more recent. Truth be told, he is almost certainly too old to add anything to the part, yet his essence puts the film's onus squarely on his shoulders--which no longer are broad enough, metaphorically-speaking, to handle such a load. As much as I hate to say it, there is not one thing he does here--whether punching out men a quarter of his age, romancing a Mexican widow, or just going on the expedition in the first place, come to think of it--that is even remotely believable without taking into account his previous exploits and sort of transposing them over the plot.In essence, Cry Macho largely consists of Eastwood doling out little pearls of wisdom (or humor) both reluctantly and through gritted teeth or with his traditional sneer. A little bit of everything is covered (family, legacy, aging, religion, love, etc.), but none of it adds up to anything in the end.Like I said, Cry Macho is better than, say, The Mule simply because it tones down the harshness of the generational rhetoric quite a bit. It feels less like a lecture and more like a leisurely siesta, albeit one completely at odds with the thematic material. While not a fun or notable watch in any sense, it does just enough to keep itself from being truly terrible,.",Cry Macho

I mean really, look how Eastwood is shuffling around the sets, trying not to fall...More bad: there is a lack of chemistry between the leading kid actor and Eastwood.Even more bad:the story is slowburning, bordering on tedious many times.It would be advisable to retire gracefully, because Eastwood's macho character looks painfully ridiculous at his age...",Cry Macho
15,paul-allaer,"Very bland, and even boring",4,19 September 2021,"As ""Cry Macho"" (2021 release; 104 min.) opens. It is ""1979"" and the Clint Eastwood character, a guy named Mike, arrives at a horse farm, only to find out that he's been let go as the horse trainer. We then go to ""One Year Later"", and Mike is approached by the very guy who fired him a year earlier to go to Mexico to retrieve that guy's 13 yr old son, who apparently is out of control. Mike reluctantly agrees and hits the road to Mexico City, where the 13 yr. Old and his mom live... At this point we are less than 15 min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: Eastwood, now a crisp 91 yr. Young if you can believe it, directs, produces and stars in the big screen adaptation of the book of the same name by Richard Nash. I did not read the book so I can't comment how closely the movie sticks to the book. Eastwood's output over the last decade, when he was in his 80s, was remarkably solid, steady and diverse (think ""American Sniper"", 'Sully"", ""Jersey Boys"", ""The Mule"", ""Richard Jewell"", etc). Eastwood's reputation as a director is frankly one that few directors could ever hope to achieve, and it long has surpassed his reputation as an actor. The is a long-winded intro to tell you that I was very surprised with ""Cry Macho"", which turns out to be a very bland, and frankly even boring, movie of an old guy teach some life lessons to a 13 yr old as they are driving north towards the US. There are no memorable scenes, the dialogue is ok but just ok. And Eastwood at this point should give up on the acting altogether. Bottom line: I was very disappointed with this film. One of the few times that I can remember watching an Eastwood-directed film that I felt I had wasted my time on.""Cry Macho"" opened in theaters this weekend but also started streaming on HBO Max, which is where I caught it. Eventually it will expand onto other streaming platforms and also as a DVD/Blu-ray. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan, I'd suggest you check this out, albeit with low expectations, and draw your own conclusion.",Cry Macho
16,stevendbeard,Slow,6,19 September 2021,"I saw ""Cry Macho"", starring Clint Eastwood-Gran Torino, Francis in the Navy; Dwight Yoakam-Logan Lucky, Under the Dome_tv; Eduardo Minett-La rosa de Guadalupe_tv, Como dice el dicho_tv and Natalia Traven-Soulmates_tv, Collateral Damage.This movie is based on a book-by the same name-that people have been trying to make into a movie for quite some time. Clint was offered the role back in 1988 but was busy doing 'The Dead Pool'. Anyway, Clint-who also directs this movie-plays a retired rodeo star in 1978 that lost his wife & son in a car accident and spiraled into depression. His friend Dwight helped him get back on his feet by hiring him to work on his ranch. It seems that Clint is good with animals. Dwight has a son by a woman that lives in Mexico and wants Clint to go and bring him back to Texas. Eduardo plays the son. Clint has to avoid Eduardo's mother and Mexican Federales after he acquires Eduardo and tries to head back to Texas. Along the way, Clint meets a friendly Natalia, who offers them help, as well as being a love interest to Clint. I love Clint Eastwood movies but this one was a little slow. My wife liked it better than I did. It's not a bad movie, it's just that Clint is 91 and it's hard to show him doing things now that he used to do when he was younger, with ease.It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.I don't think I would buy this one on DVD but if you are a Clint Eastwood fan, it would be alright as a rental.",Cry Macho

24,kluseba,Nostalgic drama with creative diversity,9,27 October 2021,"Cry Macho is an emotional road movie and western drama that is much better than its lukewarm reception might suggest.The film revolves around old rodeo star Mike Milo who has lost his family in a terrible accident and had to fight addiction and loneliness in order to stabilize his life on an isolated farm. One day, the man who has given him purpose and supported him throughout the years forces Mike Milo to bring his estranged teenage son from Mexico to the United States of America. However, the job turns out to be much more complicated than initially revealed since the teenage son is a rebellious runaway who has already been in conflict with the law on multiple occasions. Things take an even more complicated turn when it becomes evident that the boy's mother is a selfish femme fatale with ties to criminal organizations who doesn't hesitate to use violence to keep her teenage son under control. Tracked down by the police and hired guns, Mike Milo and the rebellious teenager must put their differences aside to make it to the border.Clint Eastwood's movie convinces on numerous levels. The acting performances are great and especially Clint Eastwood himself convinces as tough, resilient and grumpy man with a sinister past but a true heart of gold. The relationships between the characters are very profound and especially the rebellious teenager portrayed by Eduardo Minett and the widowed restaurant owner played by Natalia Traven are easy to empathize with. The latter character also shows that you can develop a wonderful relationship with a person of a foreign culture whose language you barely understand since emotions break down barriers. Another strength of this film is the settings varying from lush mansions in Mexico City over impoverished villages in the country to isolated farms in Texas. The use of accessories, cars and clothes bring the seventies to life in authentic fashion and add a healthy dose of nostalgic atmosphere. While this movie is first and foremost a very human drama, it also includes thrilling elements such as sinister bullying, realistic car chases and even occasional fights with fists and guns. These brief and efficiently used thrilling moments keep the movie entertaining from start to finish. Let's not forget about the amazing rooster that gives the movie its name and that offers some comic relief in many tongue-in-cheek moments throughout the film.At the end of the day, Cry Macho is a profound drama in a positively nostalgic road movie meets western style. Its characters are unique, its settings are authentic and the brief moments of thrills make the film entertaining from start to finish. Cry Macho is one of Clint Eastwood's greatest movies in recent memory and would represent an excellent conclusion to his impressive career that has left its mark on three generations and counting.",Cry Macho
25,pensman,Not for the Fast and Furious crowd,8,19 September 2021,"If this is Eastwood's swan song, then Clint has had a 180 degree turn away from the Fistful of Dollars films that made him an international star. Mike Milo, Clint, is an aging rodeo star and cowboy who looks and moves like he has broken every bone in his body. Howard Polk, Dwight Yoakam, has been footing the bills to keep his old hand housed and fed. Now Polk has a final demand: Milo needs to go to Mexico and bring him his son who has been living with his mother. Mike feels his obligation and heads off to find. Rafo. The journey back to the Texas border take on various meanings. Milo finds a purpose to his life as his candle flickers. This is a sweet film wherein the backstory is ultimately more important than the issue of reuniting a son with his father.There are several touching moments in the film and the subtle humor gives a sly nod to the man with no name. Ultimately we get an answer to what happens to a man who gets more than he deserves, a happy ending.Clint's audience, the one there from the Rawhide days, will like the film; Gen Z and Millennials probably not so much.",Cry Macho
26,AudioFileZ,Still Plays A Damaged Hero Like No Other,7,21 September 2021,There's not much one might say for Clint Eastwood left to conquer. He made the definitive western plus created the blueprint for all cop movies afterall. Even gave us some comedic relief. Yet at over 80 he's still a creative force. What seems left is just to wind down and enjoy himself. That's the feeling one gets when watching Cry Macho.Cry Macho is a very humble little story. No action to speak of and insertions of the warm and fuzzy instead. He still comes out a hero if on a small scale in a western motif. So lower your expectations and let the man entertain you with a heart in hand victory lap. I actually enjoyed the ride.,Cry Macho

Dwight Yoakam's pissed-off rancher Howard rattles off a laundry list of Eastwood's character's various faults and troubles to the man who has lived through them all.

31,maurice_yacowar,Old cowboy heals abandoned child and himself,10,20 September 2021,"""Guy wants to name his cock Macho, it's OK by me."" Thus Mike Milo responds to his young charge having named his fighting rooster ""Macho."" The line encapsulates the film's central theme - the vesting of manhood in sensitivity and healing, not in supposedly masculine aggression and force.It's supported by his advice to the youngster's learning to break and ride horses: ""Look where you're going, and go where you're looking."" That is, follow your better instincts instead of being directed by some outside force.The aged cowboy/trainer was himself broken when a bronc ride broke his back and he lost his wife and child in a car accident. The ride is played as a still newsphoto dissolving into the real life action. Just as the cowboy is brought back to life by his mission, to bring an abused 13-year-old boy from the wild street life of Mexico back to his father's ranch in Texas.Mike completes his mission, but only after the father's intentions and the boy's future have been brought into serious question. The happy ending provided Mike may prefigure the boy's eventual return too.While we meet Mike as the broken man, arriving late even to be fired from his job, the drama reveals him to be a healer. His love for animals equips him to salve their troubles and solve their ailments. Extending himself for the boy, he manages to heal himself as well, finding a new life with a new family and a recovered self-respect.As befits the 91-year-old Clint's 41st feature as a director, it opens on a landscape of autumnal foliage. Though he's a cowboy again this is modern times, with massive old bush and cars. Mike has picked up many things over the years - like the sensitivity of sign language. But there are still waters he's a fish out of, as we see when he can't understand the Spanish Marta. There Mike needs the boy as the boy needs his manhood as a model. The language gap is no abyss, though. The couple connect through glances, a touch of hands, reciprocal cooking - climactically, a dance.We could read this as perhaps Eastwood's last film, a valedictory view back upon a career of Macho roles. But that's how we read his brilliant Unforgiven - 19 years and 24 films ago, when he was but a strapping 70!The film's romance plays against tensions hovering on violence. The boy's father is a brute, as are his mother's henchmen, the border police, the general society divided into sun-hungry beauties and cockfight fans. Trust Clint to bring his hero to a desert oasis where he can find fellow survivors in warmth and love.The title is resonant too. In tying crying to macho it enforces the definition of manhood by emotions and sensitivity.It also evokes the line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar: ""Cry 'Havoc"" and let slip the dogs of war."" Often resurrected for war movies, here the 'havoc' is replaced by the dangers of the Macho ""mentality."" The old cowboy teaches the wild deracinated boy what makes for true manhood.As Will Bannister declares in the opening C & W song, it's never too late to find a new home. Because home is where the heart is, not the ... rooster?",Cry Macho

The bad people in this movie barely had any scene, and they seemed like they didn't even care enough to get their goal.The main duo had little trouble in their journey, and I didn't really care much for them. I don't like the kid character, as he was too naive and acted like a spoiled kid even though he spent a lot of time on the street. Even though Clint Eastwood's character was decent, his acting was pretty off in certain scenes, especially with his monotonic voice.The decent part of the movie was the time the duo spent with a woman and some children.

There were two 40 year old women in the film who wanted to make love to gramps. He is 90... not the good looking, handsome stud from years past. The boy who co starred was supposed to have been a hardened criminal at 13... yet he spoke like an honor student from the suburbs. As a retired teacher, I look back on the years working in youth detention facilities, as well as tough inner city high schools. Real juvenile delinquents do not talk or act like that kid. Not by a long shot. And Dwight Yoakum simply cannot act... even when you just hear his voice on a phone conversation... really bad.One more thing..Clint's character was hired by a man to drive from Texas to Mexico City to retrieve his son.

But honestly, Rafo was peculiarly painful to watch. I kept wondering whether he would ever get another acting part.Aspects of the story were also utterly ridiculous, such as the whole mother of Rafo thing--I mean, is she supposed to be a nymphomaniac,or what? Really? More horrible acting. The widow who fell instantly in love with Clint was equally risible. Note also that the film ends before closing the frame of the opening sequence. Again, bad writing.As for Clint, he did all right and was in fact the only redeeming factor to the whole production. But I do not recommend Cry Macho at all.

42,MrDHWong,"A straightforward, predictable journey from A to B that does little else than what it says on the tin",6,28 October 2021,"""Cry Macho"" is a neo-Western film based on the novel of the same name by N. Richard Nash. Directed by and starring Clint Eastwood in the lead role, it is a straightforward, predictable journey from A to B that does little else than what it says on the tin.In 1979 in Texas, popular rodeo star Mike Milo (Clint Eastwood) is forced to retire due to serious injuries sustained after falling off his horse. One year later, Mike's old boss Howard (Dwight Yoakam) asks him to cross the border into Mexico to bring home the latter's teenage son Rafo (Eduardo Minett). After arriving in Mexico City, Mike eventually meets up with Rafo and discovers that he is a delinquent surviving on money won in cockfights by his pet rooster Macho. Despite some hesitance, Mike successfully persuades Rafo to return to his father and the two of them set off back to Texas.Aside from maybe John Wayne, the one actor best associated with the Western genre as a whole is Clint Eastwood. His appearances in classics such as ""A Fistful Of Dollars"", ""For A Few Dollars More"", and of course ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" have helped cement his legacy as an icon of pop culture. Although it is nice to see Eastwood return to his Western roots, albeit in a more contemporary setting, ""Cry Macho"" lacks the visceral impact required to leave any real impression on the viewer.The film's plot is nothing more than a typical bonding story between an old man and his younger travelling companion. In a regular old road movie, I wouldn't mind this too much but the issue here is that hardly any problem they end up facing along the way feels like a genuine threat to their safety. Despite the odd obstruction on their journey, they prove to be little more than minor inconveniences for our main characters. For example, one scene involves Rafo's former guardian threatening them with a gun but he is so easily overpowered and dealt with that there is no tension to be felt whatsoever. Even something like their vehicle being stolen earlier on isn't treated as an important problem since they conveniently find an abandoned car on the side of the road a short time later. As a result, it hardly feels like the two are actually growing as people on their journey because there isn't anything teaching them new things. I think this story would have benefitted greatly from including more challenging predicaments that force the two to step out of their comfort zones to overcome them in more practical ways, as things aren't always this easily dealt with in real life.As much as I've enjoyed seeing Clint Eastwood on screen over the years, I think he is better suited working behind the camera. Here, Eastwood again shows his skills as a director by likening the 1980s setting to that of the old Western films he helped make famous. He makes good use of the wide empty desert surrounding the area of the Texas/Mexico border to establish how things have remained visually the same even after more than one hundred years. There were even moments where I couldn't help but imagine the characters on horseback rather than driving around in a car. He also does a nice enough job of pacing the film, considering that it is virtually action free and relies mainly on lengthy conversations between the characters.In the lead role, Eastwood proves that even in his nineties, he is still capable of holding our attention for the complete duration of a motion picture. Notably, his character Mike is much less violent and more pragmatic compared to most of his previous roles. I liked his interactions with young Rafo, whom he teaches some important facts about his own life up to that point. However, it's easy to tell that his advanced age has been taken into account for a role like this as he barely does anything that could be considered athletic. The very fact that Mike has been injured and hobbles around slowly seems to have been factored in greatly for Eastwood's performance. All he can really do now is yell and swear at anyone who bothers him, which is a far cry from the man of action we know him best for. As for Eduardo Minett, he is clearly inexperienced with English speaking roles. His delivery of his English dialogue sounded jarringly off-putting, almost as though he isn't aware of how to emote properly in a different language. On the other hand, whenever he spoke Spanish, he sounded perfectly fine.At this point in Eastwood's career, I guess it doesn't really matter what type of movie he makes anymore. The man has four Oscars in his possession and I assume a large bank account to go along with it so if he wants to make something as mediocre as this then I believe he should feel free to do so. And that's not to say this film is bad, it's just one of those harmless, forgettable, formulaic stories of an intergenerational friendship we've all seen many times before.I rate it 6/10.",Cry Macho
43,statuskuo,A Droning Outdated Project From A Legend,2,21 September 2021,"I think Warner Bros. Just tells Clint to take a few cameras and a few no-names and go keep yourself busy. The worst part of this project is that Clint tosses out so many old tropes presuming we would go along when none of the emotion is earned. Here he plays a ol' cowboy who use to be a rugged horse trainer until a moment of ego turns him into a drunk, painkiller popping grizzled old jerk. None of which is shown here. Simply because Clint, in his 90's, shows zero evidence he ever had that fire in him. Instead, it all talk and no show. And, of course, the typical Eastwood brand of female interaction where clearly every Mexican woman wants to jump his bones. It's really embarrassing. Since, he gives nothing in terms of why they should even like him, just that he's a ""gringo"" from America. Granted this takes place in 1979 where our society is a little more aware that Americans aren't the center of the universe. It's just cringey. Now look, the entire movie had me wondering who is the worst actor, Dwight Yokam who reads his lines like he's in some high school play, or the kid who has zero personality, screen presence or whose Mexican accent needs to be retired. Or perhaps it turns out it's actually Clint's direction. People show up and disappear. They have the standard corrupt Mexican Federales. And so forth... zzzzz... This felt like it should've been Clint's first film. I mean, it seriously felt like he just started to direct. And I'm glad he didn't make this horrible mistake coming out of the gate. Otherwise we might not have ever gotten ""Unforgiven"" Here, it seems he fell asleep at the wheel. This is just such a blah lackluster movie, and would suck if it were the nail coffin in Eastwood's career. It falls hard. But, I'm sure this was simply an exercise to keep Clint moving forward in life. Nothing worthwhile but to allow Clint to move around.The bright spot of the film is Marta played by Natalia Traven, the small town Mexican woman who has had a world of tragedy come down on her. She bounces through life with a buoyancy and hope. And has such a good natured quality about her, its hard not to want to cheer for her happiness.The rest is...lingering dullness.",Cry Macho

Woody Allen was at least smart enough to take himself out of his movies. This wouldn't have been good no matter who played Clint's role, but it was especially bad with him in it. And the poor kid who played the co-star will likely never act again, so I hope he was well-compensated for this one. That probably goes for everyone else who was in this as well. Yikes Clint - maybe it's time to try knitting to pass the time.",Cry Macho
47,Draysan-Jennings,Simple film,6,18 September 2021,It's always great watching a new Clint Eastwood film but this might be my least favorite. Don't get me wrong. It was an easy watch with some good acting and a decent storyline. But nothing really memorable happens. It seemed as if they were just kinda hanging out during most of the film. And what happened to the ending? Did they cut it? He just drops the kid off and that's it? That was way too short. This film definitely had another good 30 minutes of story left. Either way it's still worth checking out.,Cry Macho
48,sweidman-28016,Nothing Eastwood Hasn't Made Already,4,29 September 2021,"""Look where you're going, and go where you're looking.""Based on the book of the same name, Cry Macho stars Clint Eastwood as a one-time rodeo star and washed-up horse breeder who takes a job from an ex-boss to bring the man's young son home and away from his alcoholic mom. Crossing rural Mexico on their way back to Texas, the unlikely pair faces an unexpectedly challenging journey, during which the world-weary horseman may find his own sense of redemption through teaching the boy what it means to be a good man. Clint Eastwood is 91 and still directing and acting. That is amazing. However, we've gotten to the point where he's been at the same story over and over again, just different versions. That's partially why I had no interest in Cry Macho. Had it not been on HBOMax, I would've skipped this and never watched it. I'm sort of glad that I watched it just to see where his direction is at and how Nick Schenk, who's written many features that Eastwood directed, would write this. I can confidently say this is such a bland movie. Not an inch of my body cared about it. Maybe if I liked westerns, and there's only a few that I truly like, I could've had slightly more interest in this, but I ended up multitasking and completed some work during the 100 minute runtime. If you couldn't tell already, this is a bit of a white savior movie. Nowadays, filmmakers will try to hide that fact with all the negativity surrounding it, but I don't think they cared much here. It's a lazy trope that doesn't teach anything more than a superficial lesson.Clint Eastwood can still act which is a good thing. It's kind of fun just to watch how he's doing. However, what he did behind the camera is partially why the movie suffers. All the scenes were one takes and they went with what they had. This affects the delivery of lines, acting in general, and flow of the scenes and story. It's like there wasn't enough passion to make something good out of it. The kid in the movie played by Eduardo Minett is new to this and it really shows. I got annoyed by the acting shortly through. None of the characters are that compelling because they're all in a set trope. The first scene literally has to explain to us who Clint Eastwood is and it's both bad writing and bad characterization. From that moment, I didn't raise my expectations any higher. Warner Bros. Had been quiet with the release of this and I think it might be because they knew it wouldn't be that great. Audiences have moved away from this type of story and the genre in general. It was never bound to be a hit, but it's a shame. In a different world, this could've been something at least alright.",Cry Macho
49,PedroPires90,Honest,6,29 September 2021,"I know it's cool to hate Clint Eastwood, but I respect the man. Like a lot. He clearly comes from a different time, but I honestly don't care about his politics and that doesn't influence the way I view his films. He is an absolute legend, one of the best as an actor and then also as director.This Cry Macho is not a Gran Torino or Million Dollar Baby. It's not one of his best films and has some issues. The initial plot is not that captivating, the relationship with the kid is not as strong as it should (probably because the kid is well annoying), the mum of the kid is very stereotypical like a Bond villain, some scenes are a bit overlong and messy (especially with that cock).However, it's still a very enjoyable ride. There is honesty here, there is a message, there is something about different cultures and mixed cultures, something about the past, about grief. There is something Clint wants to tell us and it's important that he had the time and the possibility to do it. Curiously, when it slows its pace - when they need to stop on a village - is when it becomes a better film. Last but not least, what a great cinematography that nobody is talking about.",Cry Macho

51,Mike_Devine,Might be time to hang up the cowboy hat,5,27 September 2021,"Clint Eastwood has had a great run in his twilight years. From his iconic delivery of ""get off my lawn"" in 'Gran Torino' to portraying an octogenarian, accidental drug smuggler in 'The Mule,' Eastwood's dramas have been crowd pleasers among audiences and critics alike. Enter 'Cry Macho' - a formulaic family drama that's supposed to evoke the same ""tug at the heartstrings"" feelings, yet it doesn't succeed as well as its predecessors.The plot of 'Macho' is straightforward enough - an old, washed up rodeo star is sent to Mexico to ""kidnap"" his friend/former boss's son (who has a prize-winning rooster who happens to excel at cockfighting). Got it. Despite its simplicity, the execution of 'Macho' comes off as being pretty sloppy, which is surprising since Eastwood also sat in the director's chair for this film. It feels pretty uneven, and there's nearly a complete dearth of action or suspense. One would expect a cowboy hat wearing Eastwood - even at 90+ years old - would be up for some excitement, but there's not much to be found.Aside from the Hollywood legend, we get to know newcomer Ivan Hernandez as Lucas, who seems like the furthest thing from a friend to Eastwood's Mike. The two actors do not have much chemistry, and it shows. Despite the warm message that's at the heart of 'Macho,' it gets swept away like the desert dust due to the laziness of the film.'Cry Macho' is perhaps a sign that Clint Eastwood should begin to wind down his acting gigs after a long, storied career.",Cry Macho

53,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,7,6 October 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.Honestly, this isn't the best Clint movie ever...it doesn't have to be. It's a small story told in an intimate manner. Anyone expecting Clint to somehow reverse time and become Harry Callahan or Josey Wales again are going to disappointed - much in the same way McCartney fans were disappointed that the Wings weren't as good as the Beatles...and Wings fans were disappointed by Paul's post-Wings tunes. It's all relative. He's competing against himself.I applaud Clint for his dedication to the craft and for continuing to work...impressive. With that......this movie started out pretty rough. Yoakam is an excellent actor and does great in his small role. However, the opening scenes between him and Clint were awkward. The dialog wasn't natural at all. It felt like they were running lines instead of filming the final cut. When Clint arrives in Mexico to retrieve the teenager, it got worse. The kid just isn't ready for a film featuring a living legend.Once the two hit the road, it got a little better and by the time they became stranded and meet café owner, Marta, who is outstanding, it got much better. Much has been said about the age differences between her and Mike (Clint)...get over it. They had a bond and I thought it was entertaining.Overall, I enjoyed it enough and it was better than The 15:17 to Paris, which (to me) is the worst movie he's Directed.If you're a Clint completest like me, of course you're going to watch it.

Like the opening scene's dialogue to give you Clint's background was weird and very unnatural. Then the whole set up of Clint even going along with going to Mexico to kidnap a kid. And who would hire a 90 year old to do that? The boarder guard macking on the girls? Then the mom trying to have sex with Clint was weird. And when the cops bust the cock fight and Clint hides behind a crate? The cops don't search the place but they are out in the streets looking?I haven't seen a Clint movie in a while because they haven't been too great. They're overly slow and he's lost that ambition he used to have and comes at every movie the same way. The only reason I watched this was because it was on HBO Max. And I want to like Clint's movies.

A would be action thriller about a grizzled old cowboy battles the bad guys when taking a Mexican boy to the US. It is a clever different film. It is a quiet, gentle, and even endearing film. Clint Eastwood is very good as a weathered, broken and lonely former rodeo star that takes a mission to find his boss's son who lives in Mexico. His father wants to get the boy to the US. This film is mostly a road film. Where the 91 year old cowboy get ls to know the boy and shows him certain lessons as well as learning from him.

Mike is asked to have someone bring his lost son Rafo (Eduardo MInett) back to America from Mexico and rescue him from his alcoholic mother. During the journey, Mike sees that Rafo has never really had a good father figure in his life and sees this as an opportunity to take on this role to teach Rafo what it means to be a good man.This film comes across as a passion project for Clint Eastwood, who is still trying to make a good movie in his old age. Unfortunately, Clint Eastwood seems to copy previous films he has directed in this film, losing the originality of this film. For Clint Eastwood fans, the film can seem fun, but familiar and at times a bit predictable.The script is based on the book by writer N. Richard Nash and further written by Nick Schenk, who has previously written scripts for Eastwood films, but also does nothing new or special with this story. The film can be a bit long-winded at times.Clint Eastwood still seems to have fun making movies like this and then starring in them. Clint Eastwood likes to play an older man trying to teach a younger boy how to live his life.

Its an average that's has funny and heart warming moments, but it's more your run of the mill cross country film. Clint Eastwood even at 91 still gives a likeable performance delivery quirks and all around a likable guy. Who's an old grump who might make a difference. While the movie is rather fast brushed over who he is and want he was like. The opening immediately just throws it at you real quick and moves on.. He does give insight just not that much. The chemistry between him and Eduardo is special in a way, but it's not the same as gran torino or million dollar baby.

As a director, he is still a master of the trade, but the stories he tells - either mesmerizingly beautiful or painfully utter crap. The older he gets, the worst it is.

While still a good actor, his body movements look noticeably wobbly, but there's still screen charisma and the story was mostly interesting aside from an unnecessary subplot of Clint healing animals so to speak and they tried to have a romantic relationship between Eastwood and a waitress. The problem is she doesn't speak English and it would be tough for him to understand since he keeps needing translations. Subtitles appear very randomly in this movie.

The scene with the mother was laughable. It took me out of the film completely.

Sure it's amazing to see Clint at 91 still out there but he's literally hobbling through this role, knowing that curiosity about seeing what this old man can still churn out will be the main draw. He's selling his name.It is impossible to make comparisons to earlier work and to separate out your reflections on the obvious cosmetic work that he seems to have only applied to his upper face , which often gives him the appearance of a smiling infant, the character lines around the forehead and eyes, the famous squint , all gone.The film ""Lucky"", with Harry Dean Stanton at 90 years old, is 90 times the movie this is in every way, and he died a few months after making it.It's kind of sad. It's great to see Clint out there being productive, but one is thinking about that, and rationalizing the obvious weaknesses of this production away, almost feeling guilty for thinking the obvious thoughts that will keep cropping up.It's actually a back handed compliment to the great career of this great person. Like Elvis past his Prime, or so many others, you go anyway as a tribute and just to be in the presence of the person, even if it's film.There is a genuine sweetness to the film, and a genuine sweet spirit to Eastwood, the man, that is obvious here, and in that way it may well be his most transparent and least actorly performance ever.There are stutters and slight vocal slips, that are just the normal things that happen with age, and when Clint says of the Deputy's dog, ""I don't know how to fix old age"", it's really sad . And this sort of thing is happening all through the film.And because it is Clint Eastwood, it is worth seeing, and is a nice movie,
and it's like you are watching a ghost of the man, it gains a morbid interest.I really don't want to be negative about this profoundly terrific person, in all the paths he's been such an enormous talent and success in. He has given and got a huge amount in this life, and there is nothing to feel sorry about.

Plus throw in to the story the two absolute boobs who are the bodyguards and enforcers for villianess-they are about as efficent as Abbott and Costello, eventually being taken care of by kid's rooster (Macho!)Clint...you've had a great career, but please stay behind the camera.

The characters are clichéd and every single women that lays her eyes on Mike immediately falls in love with him. It was a bit too much.Overall, this movie will be too slow and event-less for most people's taste. It is so slow that the story doesn't even reach full conclusion at the end of its 100 minutes.

123,cschultz-2,More Elegy Than Western,6,19 September 2021,"""Cry Macho"" Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, 104 Minutes, Rated PG-13, Released September 17, 2021:""I'll tell you something, kid,"" movie legend Clint Eastwood's character tells his young traveling companion in ""Cry Macho,"" the new movie from Warner Bros. Pictures now playing in theaters across the country, ""This macho thing is overrated."" It's a startling admission from an actor who in the course of some 72 motion pictures over 66 years has staked his career on proving exactly the opposite.In ""Cry Macho"" elderly former Texas rodeo star Mike Milo (Eastwood) is compelled by his landlord and ex-employer Howard Polk (a whiny Dwight Yoakam) to travel into Mexico, snatch his estranged teenage son Rafo (Eduardo Minett) from his irresponsible mother (Fernanda Urrejola), and spirit the boy illegally across the border into the US. Little does Milo know that Polk is motivated not by fatherly love, but by clandestine financial concerns.Adapted by Nick Schenk from N. Richard Nash's 1975 novel of the same name and directed by Eastwood, ""Cry Macho"" is mostly a by-the-numbers enterprise, a minor western that would likely attract little attention without the participation of its director and star. With a plot that's about halfway between 1920's ""The Kid"" and ""The Marksman"" a century later, the picture moseys along a predictable trail precisely where you expect it to go, allowing star Eastwood to bond with the teenaged Minett, impart a few of life's lessons, and share a few adventures and campfires along the way.Of course, when Mike and Rafo hole up for a few days in a sleepy Mexican village about halfway through the picture and encounter a kind and attractive middle-aged widow (Natalia Traven), the owner of the local cantina who's raising her own orphaned granddaughters...well, you know the picture might not end up in Texas after all. Milo hires on as a sort of all-purpose animal whisperer and even repairs the cantina's broken jukebox so he and the widow can have some music to fall in love to. And by that point in the movie, that's more than okay with the viewer.At age 91, Clint Eastwood has aged amazingly well. But he can't perform miracles, and it's impossible to watch ""Cry Macho"" without realizing almost every step of the way that he's exactly that--a 91-year-old man. Stooped and bent, Eastwood walks slowly, and his movements are tentative and halting. His voice is reedy and he's frail, as a 91-year-old has every right to be. When he throws a punch or, even worse, climbs up onto the back of a wild stallion, the audience gasps and holds its breath. In the context of the movie's narrative, the star's age becomes a real distraction.Oh, there are brief flashes of the younger Eastwood, to be sure--if you hold your head a certain way and sort of squint you can sometimes almost see shadows of Dirty Harry or Josey Wales, or Bill Munny...or even Rowdy Yates, from all the way back in ""Rawhide"" days. Plainly Eastwood is attempting with ""Cry Macho"" the same feat John Wayne barely carried off in ""The Shootist"" and Henry Fonda won an Academy Award for in ""On Golden Pond""--that is, to script a graceful end to his film legacy and ride off into the sunset of motion picture history.But he's only half successful. Since Eastwood's debut as a director with 1973's ""Breezy"" (in which he did not appear), he's matured into one of America's premier filmmakers, a modern equivalent to the legendary John Ford. As a filmmaker, Eastwood still has a viable contribution to make--and he does. ""Cry Macho"" unfolds briskly, but Eastwood's a seasoned enough director to slow down and linger on the more soulful interludes. Photographed majestically by British cinematographer Ben Davis, the sum total of the picture is beautiful and elegiac, a tribute to Eastwood as a filmmaker.Maybe the real problem with ""Cry Macho"" is that the film's poster tells the whole story. Rendered in classic sepia tones like the cover of an old dime novel, the poster shows an ancient-looking cowboy staring with steely resolve into an uncertain future. Only after a moment does it become apparent that the cowboy is Clint Eastwood. It might've been best if the movie company had just released the poster instead of the movie, and let it go at that.Or even better--if Warner Bros. Had retained Eastwood as director and hired 57-year-old Brad Pitt to play the aging cowboy, maybe with Salma Hayek as the widow. It might've made ""Cry Macho"" an even more poignant picture. Or at least a less awkward one.""Cry Macho"" is rated PG-13 for language and thematic elements.",Cry Macho

Clearly, having Clint Eastwood (a 91 year old man) as both the protagonist and director contributes to that, but there is more to it. Everything about this production is slow and mellow, never getting too intense. The story is straightforward, small, and predictable. The editing is calm. The acting is gentle. Honestly, many viewers will find Cry Macho boring and they will have good reason. However, that doesn't make the movie bad.In fact, Cry Macho is proficient from a technical perspective. Although it is rather passive, that is its goal. The story is of a tired, old cowboy who is somewhat defeated by life. It is fitting that the film would embody these resigned feelings. Add in apt themes addressing toxic masculinity and the result is concrete messaging. It's conventional and understated, but this film has its merits. Therefore, even though Cry Macho is certainly not a movie with wide appeal, it should be generally respected.Writing: 6/10

129,dannyrovira-38154,A WONDERFUL ROAD MOVIE WITH A BRILLIANT TURN BY EASTWOOD,8,19 September 2021,"Clint Eastwood's elegant, bittersweet, heartfelt road movie is a slow-burn that is marvelously crafted and beautifully acted. 91 year old living legend Clint Eastwood delivers a wonderfully low-key charismatic performance as an aging ex-rodeo rider and horse trainer named Mike Milo, who has had a tragic hard-bitten life of drink and despair, especially after losing his wife and child in a car accident many years ago. He takes on a job from his ex-boss Howard Polk, nicely played by Dwight Yoakam, to go to Mexico and bring his 13 year old estranged son Rafo, superbly played by Eduardo Minett, back to the United States to free him from his wealthy and abusive alcoholic mother, well-played by Fernanda Urrejola. When Milo locates Rafo who has runaway from his mother, he is living on the streets and making money at illegal cockfights with his prized rooster 'Macho.' He explains and convinces Rafo to go back with him to Texas to live with his father, but his vindictive mother sends one of her hired thugs after them. Milo and Rafo's perilous journey will become an odyssey of self-discovery and redemption that will develop into a deep bond between. Astute direction by Eastwood, with exquisite cinematography by Ben Davis, and fine supporting performances by Natalia Traven, Ivan Hernadez, Marco Rodriguez, Ramona Thornton, Elida Munoz, Cesia Isabel Rosales, and Jorge-Luis Pallo. This wholesome little cinematic gem is Eastwood's 39th film as a director and it is filled with warmth, humor, and good-feelings. Highly recommended.",Cry Macho

Most of the mexican towns are so bleak with outdated cars and it wasnt even filmed there, Clint goes back to the mom, why, he didnt know what she had in mind. He is told to look less gringo so he gets a new mexico style indian design jacket. He had plenty of money but they steal cars to be even more suspicious. They spend way too long in mexico knowing they are being pursued, like over 2 weeks. He says he is an animal lover yet he worked in rodeos, animals are not treated right in rodeos. People bring him animals to cure for no reason, one is scratched and one is old. People in small rural town wouldnt know how to deal with that? He is calling the police names.

There is a bit to like: all of the performances are surprisingly good, particularly Eastwood's and Macho the rooster's. Additionally, the cinematography provides some gorgeous-looking shots. That's about it.This is one of the clumsiest screenplays I've ever seen produced. Character backstories are delivered with some of the most on-the-nose exposition I've witnessed in years, and the script never provides us with any scenes to make us care about these characters' relationships. There are no scenes in which the characters relate to one another or find true companionship in one another. There's nothing here.Speaking of nothing, this movie contains NO conflict, stakes, or emotional tension whatsoever. Every single scene plays out exactly as you would expect it to. There are no real antagonists or threats to the characters' progress at all.Every time a conflict or obstacle is introduced for Mike and Rafo to overcome, it is resolved within the same scene. The conflicts in this story are ones of minor inconvenience, and thus there is NOTHING to keep us invested or concerned for our heroes' journey.This story does not build at all. It's a series of scenes in which characters go from one place to another until the movie is over. It's nothing.Clint Eastwood...how did you allow your talent to be wasted on something as dull as this once again?",Cry Macho

It feels like another version of 'News Of The World' but without the good cinematic moments that would enrich the film. The best in my opinion was the cinematography with that chocolatey color and the music for its subtlety, the rest was a disappointment, not because it was bad, but because there was nothing really relevant, when I see a movie I want it to make me see, feel, listen, think, cry, laugh ... something; but unfortunately I was more aware of how much time was left to finish it than of the same story, as a general rule it is never a good sign when one wonders while watching a movie ""how long will it take to finish?"".",Cry Macho

138,zacdawac,100 Minutes I'm not likely to get back!,3,23 September 2021,"Clint Eastwood was a great filmmaker once, before he started talking to chairs, supporting insane politicians and managing to make boring, tedious movies about fascinating subjects like J. Edgar Hoover, Nelson Mandela, Richard Jewell and Sully. He even figured out how to totally desecrate the brilliant and compelling Broadway smash hit, Jersey Boys. In this one, amidst awful dialogue, bad acting, inconsistent characters and shallow scenes that don't go anywhere, a ninety one year old saddle tramp beats up a thirty year old gangster, engages the police in car chases, steals cars, seduces beautiful, much younger women, communicates with animals and even rides and breaks wild horses. At least he stepped back from his typical Clint Eastwood role of easily taking out the villain and saving the day. He had a large rooster, or was it a chicken, named Macho to do that.Does contemporary political correctness not apply to Clint and do the animal rights groups that monitor filmmaking also give him a pass? We have Mexican women who make their children into sex slaves as a matter of course and Mexican teenagers who naturally drink, take drugs and get involved with cockfighting. And we have chickens, or are they roosters, that battle each other. Were they able to throw in the disclaimer that no animals were harmed in making this film? Honestly, I was so relieved that this was over, I didn't stay tuned for the credits.My three stars are for effort. Part of me admires the fact that Clint keeps trekking on as an actor and director. People finance his films and as much as I've disliked some of his more recent efforts, even I continue to watch them. For all of that, Clint has my sincere admiration. However, there's also the idea of retiring with grace and dignity. Again, he directed and acted in a considerable number of truly great films, in his time. I can watch Mystic River over and over again and Play Misty for Me set the standard and paved the way for Fatal Attraction and many others like it. Clint deserves to be able to point to these films and numerous others, like Unforgiven, Bridges of Madison County and High Plains Drifter as his legacy.I wish Clint a long life and I'm sure that I'll be going to see his next six films and wondering how he can win saloon brawls at age ninety eight.",Cry Macho

The story seemed very promising and heartwarming and knowing Clint Eastwood I expected to cry my eyes out inside the theater. That's not what happened. At all. I almost fell asleep. The movies starts off pretty straight forward and the main story kicks of immediately. It continues to remain interesting for the first half hour but after that it seems like the screen writers had run out of ideas. The plot kinda stops and the only thing we are witnessing are Mike Mailo and Raffa hanging out. Nothing happens to move the plot forward. It's so forgettable that two days have passed and I'm struggling to remember what happened in order to write this review. The acting is also not good at all as Raff's lack of talent is obvious (Eastwood is great as always of course but unfortunately he is not alone in the movie).

I get so sick of movies and tv shows forcing their sexual preferences on folks who don't care for that preference at all.

169,kstice-25195,Decent Eastwood film weakened by screenplay and acting,6,19 September 2021,"If you watch Cry Macho expecting a classic like Million Dollar Baby or Gran Torino, you will be disappointed. However, Cry Macho still tells a quality story. It also needs to be said that regardless of the movie's imperfections, being able to direct and play the lead actor in a film at 91 years old is extremely impressive. First, there are numerous positive aspects to this film. Cry Macho beautifully depicts the deserts of Northern Mexico and uses the film's setting to its full advantage. Although many actors gave below average performances, it's always great to still see Clint Eastwood. Additionally, Macho the rooster provides a nice comic relief to the film and helps make the relationship between Clint Eastwood and Eduardo Minett more special. Ultimately, I enjoyed watching the relationship between these two develop.Unfortunately, there are some pretty big flaws in this movie that can't be ignored. The screenwriting needed significant improvement. The movie fundamentally suffered from lacking a strong conflict. Eastwood and Minett are half-heartedly chased by some police officers and one bodyguard. This poor writing really weakens the climax, as there isn't an important conflict to resolve. The small amount of action is easily resolved without much fuss. Also, many of the film's actors give poor performances, including co-star Eduardo Minett. His acting was more on par with a daytime soap opera than a major motion picture.Overall, Cry Macho is a decent film that Clint Eastwood fans will appreciate despite its clear flaws. 6/10Pros and Cons Summary+Beautiful cinematography and setting+Clint Eastwood+Macho the rooster-The screenplay is sub-par-Acting could have been much better, especially Eduardo Minett-The climax is disappointing, anti-climatic, and has quite a few plot holes.",Cry Macho

173,trav123,Kudos for Clint at 91 yet this story is milk toast hallmark film,5,19 September 2021,There is a lot of merit to watching good ole Clint at 91 still cranking out films looking more like Bruce Dern but as a big fan of all of his films this one unfortunately does not have grit.It almost feels like a hallmark or cheesy lifetime movie done in a few locations almost like a cheap indy film rather than a master like Clint but it is mostly due to a lackluster story/script.The acting by Clint is always steady yet you feel like he might fall over at any time and his side kick the mexican kid is not worthy of carrying this very simple story but does a decent job looking like Karate kid.It has great meaning and purpose yet not enough depth to really carry the entire film and Clint does his best but this is one of those stories/scripts that should have stayed on the shelf or maybe made into a tv movie. Watch it with low expectations and the horse scenes and Clint dancing are enjoyable.The cock Macho deserves an Oscar!Looking forward to Clint's next movie and kudos for still cranking them out esp in the heat of New Mexico.5 stars for Clint.,Cry Macho
174,danny-prichard,Bad Movie,3,2 October 2021,"Well, I read many of the bad reviews for Clint Eastwood's latest movie, Cry Macho. But I'm saving the new Sopranos-based movie for tomorrow night when Teresa and I can watch it together so I figured ""Hey, it's Clint Eastwood. How bad can it be?"" Well, the answer is really, really bad. Listen, I don't need for a lot to happen in a movie as long as there's a good plot and acting. But this movie not only had nothing going on but anytime something started to move along a bit the absurd dialect and absolutely horrendous acting job by the child star who performed opposite Eastwood, Eduardo Minett, ruined any chance this movie had of even being adequate. Maybe Eastwood owed Minett's family money otherwise there's no logical reason why he got this part. Simply put, that kid cannot act. Most of the time when he was supposed to be showing a deeply hurt, abused, sympathetic kid, he instead came off as a pouty, spoiled moron. And excuse me if I have trouble swallowing the fact that a 91 year old Eastwood attracted not one but two babes during the flick. One offered to hop in the sack with him not 5 minutes after meeting him. And the other made google eyes at him that would have embarrassed a 12 year old girl. I've been an Eastwood fan my whole life and that hasn't changed. With that said, it might be time for Clint to hang them up.",Cry Macho

Not afraid to be spare, to be personal, to relish the small moments.But he is old and so is Yoakim. The pace of the movie reflects that. No shots fired, no running chase scenes. There is a very easy on the eyes seductress that is a character lost in the movie. There is a young actor - who can't carry any scene in the first third of the film - then he grows a little into the role.But the film builds suspense and builds humanity. When the film closes - it was satisfying and the good spirit of it stays with you - I realized I enjoyed a film without CGI and flaming stunts.

It would've made more sense if Clint's character had a large upbringing in Mexico, but even then the whole leading scenarios aren't as believable. Clint's character still acts like he's trying to be a 30 year old stud. And all the Mexican characters feel like something out of a cheesey modern soap opera instead of the 1980 lifestyle at the time.

It's hard to really pin point to be honest when I think about it. He is an icon. What I do know however is that this movie is a travesty. In my eyes, this is not an Eastwood film because it lacks all of the important points that would make it so. In closing, He should not have acted in this film in the least.

The posture, the demeanor, the movements, but especially the breathing and weak voice (Picard came to mind) are all understandable for someone his age (and not many of us will reach it, let alone looking like that), but that is exactly why he should not have been cast as the lead, brave as though that is. Once I noticed it this the plot and all subplots come tumbling down, nothing seemed believable, and I started to complain of details I might not even notice with a different lead dynamic. The story, the romantic undertones, the Oedipus issues, even the acting. Clint Eastwood is still a very good filmmaker, surrounded by talent.

Eastwood is a confident director who knows what he wants, and he delivers a solid picture here. And for fans, it's good to see his cowboy persona get another kick at the can with this nicely understated performance.While it's a decent film I still felt it unsatisfying somehow.

This one, IMHO, was hobbled by the script. At the beginning, Dwight Yokum gives us Eastwood's back story in an artificially jam-packed bit of ""dialogue."" Amateur hour. This is followed by many leaden exchanges throughout the film. The lead role is meant for a man 30 years younger. The things he does are simply implausible for a 90-year-old. The attempted seduction scene is just beyond belief. Even the love interest is young enough to be his granddaughter. Decent people who love their partners hang in when they decline. But few sincere significant others sign on for a relationship as caregiver from the outset. Was he trying to remake Grand Torino? This script is trite and offers few surprises, well-intentioned though it may be. What I don't get is how this story got Eastwood's approval...he's proven himself to be more discerning. And it having gotten past him, why didn't his people speak up? A sure-fire payday perhaps.

There are so many moments in this movie that we are expected to dismiss reality. Firstly, if Dwight had a kid with a Mexican woman, the kid would not look one hundred percent Mexican.Also, you don't ask your ninety-year-old friend and ex employee to kidnap your kid that you have never bothered to be a parent of. Later in the movie we learn it is so Dwight can extort money from the extremely rich mother. The request had merit, in that Dwight was concerned for the kid's well being. He was being abused. Not sure how the he knew, but sure enough the kid was no more important to the mother than the next meaningless fling.That is the first twenty minutes. After that it is all downhill. The comely mother who takes great offense to Clint coming to take her son away, seemingly does a 180 and says, ""If you can find him, you can have him."" Clint finds him and upon taking the kid back home to gather belongings, the mother tries to seduce ninety-year-old Clint. Clint refuses her advances and she threatens to have the Federales arrest him for kidnapping.

The car is stolen, Clint fights the mother's thug, they steal a car, and later steal another car.Eventually, they make it to the border and somehow the kid is reunited with his absentee father.

Any scenes involving him fighting or breaking horses seem ridiculous because of this, as well as him being sent on any sort of mission in the first place.My favorite part was his relationship with the barkeeper and her grandchildren.

As for his acting, I wish he would cast another actor in the roles he casts himself. He's always been a pretty one dimensional actor and early on in his career it didn't make a difference because the roles only really called for an actor without much depth.

The stereotypes abound in this shallow story of an elderly man who despite being out of his element (physically, culturally, socially, generationally) can set everything straight by merely uttering a word. The women around him swoon, upstanding men doff their hats to him, the children gambol around him, and the bad guys (yes, there's no grey area in this fictitious world) get their comeuppance--all just because, well, he's a gringo who knows better than everyone else and can strut around a modern Mexico--that somehow still seems stuck in 1930s no matter when he turns--setting everyone straight.

As a drama it is as believeable as a comedy as it is a drama. Clint at 91 is still attempting to protray himself as a sexy macho guy, being seduced by thirty somethings and riding bucking broncos. If he lived from being thrown from the bucking horse he was supposedly riding, he would be in a wheel chair for the rest of his life if he lived. It was a ludicrous couple of minutes.

Reviewed 100 times. Flat & non credible (I can't tell you without spoiling). Stop using scenario-making softwares or cheap marketers instead of good scenarists. What is this, film-making for dumb dummies ? Excuse me, i'm sad and angry. The scenes are cut with an ax. Everything is just crude clichés: the music, the landscapes, the light, the police, the Mexican mamma, the lying and thieving behavior. The mother of the little one is rather eccentric than useless. The film is flat, it looks like a cut of scenes with no strong glue, no flavor. The role of the wild ""demon"" kid is failed, The complicity between the kid and the old man is failed, between the old man and the horses is failed, between the mamma (sister of E.

It tries to have a Gran Torino style relationship between Clint and a young kid he wants to guide, but unfortunately the supporting actors in this film are wooden at best and the story is too basic to really keep you interested.

But for most of the cast, the acting is pretty bad (Eastwood is mostly good), direction and editing seem pretty bad. Worst part of the movie is the writing which often comes off naïve and laughable - most of the characters lacks debt and often their behavior makes little sense. The movie's pacing is very slow and that's totally fine by me, I expected that, but when the characters are paper-thin and story development is off and doesn't interest me, the movies come off as dull and boring instead of thoughtful and interesting.I hope this will not become Mr. Eastwood's final movie and he still has the drive and stamina to make great movies again.",Cry Macho

295,maiderekk,Boring and definitely NOT a Western,3,21 September 2021,"I fail to see how this movie falls into the western genre. There is NOTHING even remotely western about this film. It takes place in 1979 not 1879, yet it's being marketed as a western film, and all the media outlets are screaming ""Clint rides again!"" What a joke.The only element in the film that even comes close to the Western genre is the Mexican desert setting, and then of course there's Clint Eastwood, a western star. You do the math:Western movie star + Mexican desert setting= Western movie?? 🤔Just because 90% of the film takes place in the desert and the leading actor is a western star, that doesn't make it a western film. I'd like to know what the writers/marketing team were smoking when they came up with that conclusion.That being said, I'm a great admirer of Clint Eastwood's films, but Cry Macho falls incredibly short on Eastwood's filmography. And when I say short, I mean bottom of the barrel. Which is a shame considering this is the same mastermind who gave us films like:The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)
Unforgiven (1992)
Mystic River (2003)
Million Dollar Baby (2004)
Gran Torino (2008)To name a few...There's not much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said, but I think the overall feeling amongst moviegoers and Clint fans has been one of great disappointment. Especially when you compare it to Eastwood's previous achievements, whether it be acting, directing, or both, it leaves you wondering... Why? With the possibility of this being his last film ever.. This is how he wants to wrap up his career?________________________________________________
CRY MACHO in a nutshellWe're immediately introduced to Clint Eastwood's character Mike, an ex-cowboy and one-time rodeo star, who's just been fired or rather forced into retirement by his boss Howard (Dwight Yoakam). Howard insults Mike, tells him he's lazy, and doesn't take the job seriously anymore, and let's him know he's being replaced by a younger guy.Fast forward a year later. Same boss begs Mike to go to Mexico to bring back his 13-year old son who he feels is in trouble. Mike is 90-years old and barely speaks a word of Spanish, but sure he'll be fine in 1979 Mexico according to Howard simply because he ""used to be a cowboy.""Mike heads to Mexico and finds out his bosses son is a rough kid who participates in cock fights with a rooster named Macho. Mike learns this after visiting the boy's mother who awkwardly tries to persuade the 90-year old into staying and having a drink with her.Mike finds the kid (Rafo) with little effort and when the Police arrive to break up the cock fight, Mike simply stands and hides behind a stack of shipping crates. It's so silly and obvious that all the cops would have to do is look around the corner, but they don't.For the second time, we get to see Rafo's attractive 39-year old mom unsuccessfully try to bed the old man who is more than twice her age. The scene is so cringeworthy and uncomfortable that I have no idea how Fernanda Urrejola was able to act like her character wanted to bang a 90-year old man.From this point on the film turns into a boring on-the-road style movie where Clint Eastwood is essentially doing nothing with this kid except traveling from place to place and encountering only minor inconveniences that have little to no effect on the characters journey back to the American border.Mike and Rafo meet a sweet woman in a village who takes a liking to Mike. Mike tells Rafo his father has ulterior motives for wanting him back. Rafo gets upset and says this is why he doesn't trust anyone, but it's resolved in a matter of 5 minutes and he's back on the road with Mike.Before reaching the border Mike and Rafo have a brief standoff with one of his mother's bodyguards, but they're able to get out of the situation in such an easy, goofy way that it just amounts to nothing but bad writing.Mike drops the kid off with his father at the border. Rafo let's Mike keep Macho. Mike then goes back to the sweet woman in the village. The end. Cry Macho in a nutshell.________________________________________________You may be wondering, ""come on there has to be more to it than that."" Well, sadly there isn't.This IS the entire story, and I honestly couldn't wait for it to end.Cry Macho, in my opinion, is by far the worst film Clint Eastwood has ever made. The only good thing this film has going for it is the cinematography. There are some gorgeous shots of scenery in the Mexican desert. That's about it.The story was very weak, but the acting was even weaker. I have to tip my hat to Clint Eastwood for still doing this at 91, but his age is really starting to show and at times it seems like the poor guy can barely stand up.But that's nothing compared to Eduardo Minett's performance as Rafo (the kid). I know he's young, but he seriously needs to go back to school and learn how to act because he can't even display the slightest bit of emotion and it really shows.Bottom line. The movie is just not good at all. I hate saying that because I love Clint Eastwood, but I can't ignore how sinfully boring and unenjoyable this movie is at the same time.I could go on for hours about all the little things that bothered me, but the single most defeating factor of the entire movie is that it's just plain boring. Probably one of the most boring movies I've ever seen in my life. Nothing exciting ever happens throughout the entire movie. No action, no suspense, nothing.I can't imagine Clint Eastwood watching the finished product and actually being proud of it.",Cry Macho

So, he presents a story (jam-packed with insulting Mexican stereotypes) in which an American rescues a Mexican teenager by bringing him to Texas. Talk about shooting himself in the foot.

305,gringopaul,Disconnected From Reality,2,20 September 2021,"Clint Eastwood barely missed creating a great ""so bad it's good"" comedy. He tries playing an aging but still virile cowboy, but cannot pull it off. He's 90, and supposedly ended a rodeo career with a broken back. He's sent into Mexico to retrieve the worst Mexican child actor they could possibly find and bring him back to his backstabbing ex-employer, supposedly the boy's father. He goes to Mexico City to get the boy, but other than a brief shot of city lights of a city of maybe 200,000 (not 10,000,000, like the real Federal District), it portrays Mexico like a rural backwater. All the Mexicans are like a Frito Bandito ad came to life. They are the worst racism you can imagine. The bad guys are afraid of Clint, who is so frail he can barely walk. Every Mexican, young or old, is incompetent or stupid beyond belief. They almost all speak English. The leading lady is 50 years younger than Clint and smoking hot. She tries seducing him twice, and he acts like it would be doing her a favor that he's not going to give. Big white Clint shows those Mexicans who's boss. It's like a farce, except old Clint isn't in on his own joke.Not one scene was believable. Some of the cinematography is OK. None of the dialog rang true. No characters connected with one another, especially Clint and the terrible young actor Big White Clint rescues. Moral of the story? I guess it's that all Mexicans are stupid, afraid of dried up old white guys except when hot chicks are horny for a caucasian savior. I cannot believe this is the same guy who helmed The Unforgiven, Flags of our Fathers, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and Gran Torino. Everybody makes mistakes.

As a result, the movie is unrelatable. If you consider it a fairly tale (there are many implausible turn of events), it still doesn't carry any deep morals. It is directed badly starting from the rushed early scenes just to get the man and the boy on the road that don't have any character development to emphasize with either of them.

334,jabox-oneandonly,Crying Average,6,6 October 2021,"Clint Eastwood is an enigmatic and iconic director and actor. His films often are filled with his many passions and hobbies to the point of admiration. His storytelling is usually maculate and even when you know where it's going you're still colored impressed. Sadly doesn't happen that much here. What separates this from his other works is it's hook which is simply an old washed-up cowboy helps bring a son to his father all the while teaching him like one. Very similar to Gran Torino. And like Gran Torino it offers a buddy-buddy adventure through the lens of an old wise man teaching his young but tough kid pupil. Pretty simple when said aloud, which unfortunately happens too, literally so; it being very exposition heavy especially in the beginning. I guess what makes this different is it's many takes on being tough, ""macho"", and Gran Torino is more about how our cultural differences don't make us indifferent as a whole. Unlike Gran Torino, Cry Macho lacks that energy and edginess. Not that it's terrible but it feels like it's missing something. It's got Clint Eastwoods performance but what it doesn't have is a good supporting actor and interesting story. Lot of it feels superficial and surface level, which to be fair is most of his films but this one lacks all the grand positives that make his other films feel so great. Yet it's not unwatchable too. What keeps your attention is the dynamic between the two (despite the kid sucking). It's snappy and quiet funny when the pace picks up but also stagnates and is repetitive when it doesn't. And outside the two actors are alright performances but the majority are cartoony. Also for a movie that say's it takes place in the 80's it sure doesn't feel like it. There were points where it was too modern. Couldn't really differentiate it and without the dates, I honestly couldn't tell.Sorry, it's just in my opinion this is his weakest and safest film. Filled to the brim with convenient exmachinas. Ones filled with the rooster they carry, whose obvious foreshadowing and symbolism were already enough annoying, it seemed like being a vocal point.. It's just I don't disagree with any of the politics behind the film, it's more on how it was shot and how it played out I have a deal with. Some of it feels genuine through the guise of an average movie but I overall it's just a boring story. The ending is good though, not surprising. Clints typically good with saying things that aren't alright said.Finally, I don't dislike this film, it's just it feels so safe. Almost like he listened to his critics of Gran Torino. Average at best. Good performance from Clint of course but god awful performance from the supporting actor. Their dynamic was at times fun but mostly mundane because of the heavy exposition.

I was happy there were no love scenes.Eastwood shows his age with shuffling around instead of walking and all bent over; but at 90 that is an accomplishment but not for this movie.

However, the writing can get a little juvenile at times, as if a lot of inane filler was added for no reason.

The story and Traven's portrayal of Marta saved this film. At points it was easy to predict what lied ahead but it was still entertaining to watch it unfurl. Dwight Yoakam's delivery was the first sign that it might be a long night but it turned out to be worth staying until the end. Yoakam's performance was difficult to watch in almost every scene he was in. There were also several points where Eastwood showed his chops aren't quite what they used to be but if I can remember lines and deliver them even half as well I'd consider myself very lucky. I guess it's hard to live up to such a magnificence of youth just as his character states at one point in the film.

408,gayathmikariyapperuma,Cry Macho - A story of being lost... and found,8,10 October 2021,"Over the years of Clint Eastwood's career, the Western is a genre which he has made a considerable impact. Starting from the tv show Rawhide in 1950's, Eastwood has remarked his career in Westerns. His career expands from an actor to an academy award winning director which also involves the same genre, Unforgiven. In Cry Macho, Eastwood returns to his director's chair and as a producer while appearing in front of the camera.The plot is quite familiar to the Clint Eastwood movie fans. It is a The Gauntlet: a story of a man who is assigned to bring a wild person back to the authority. It is a Gran Torino: Eastwood becomes the mentor of a lost boy. It is a The Bridges of Madison County: two adults fall in love. It is a The Mule: a long trip along a dirty road with illegal stuff(fugitive) onboard while the federals are following.No matter what it looks like, Cry Macho is once rejected script. It was almost becoming an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, but he turned it down due to his duties as the governor of California. Then it came after Eastwood, but he selected Dirty Harry movie instead. Later the script was converted into a novel by the same author, N. Richard Nash. Over the years the script was tossing around and until Eastwood took a one last sight at it. Eastwood said, ""It's fun when something's your age, when you don't have to work at being older"". The novel is barely seen in the movie as it has more Eastwood facts in it. But the story is interesting.The first ten minutes of the movie brings us the former Texas rodeo star, Michael ""Mike"" Milo (Clint Eastwood), gets fired from his job at the ranch. While Dwight Yoakam as the boss Howard Polk reminds the down fall of the hero, Eastwood shoots some dashing words which cues some shadows of Harry Callahan. Anyway, the time fast-forwarded to one year, when the boss returns to assign Mike to the job of bringing his only son, Rafael ""Rafo"" (Eduardo Minet) back to him from his abusive mother Leta (Fernanda Urrejola) in Mexico.From that moment onwards Mike is on his mission: sanctioned kidnapping. He finds the ""nutcase"" Leta at her bungalow, partying with people. Later he realized that boy he seeks is more than a teenager. Rafo is a gambler, thief and cockfighter who lives in the gutter. Surprisingly, the boy is crazy about cowboys which is later proved through the photograph with his father at the ranch which appears only for few minutes on screen when Mike sneaks into Rafo's room. He agrees to come with Mike though Leta does not allow them.Mike has a risky job to do but, his approach does not reveal that he has taken it as serious as the audience take. He enjoys the clean air and beautiful wide-open spaces. After some evasions from Leta's bodyguards and federals Mike says to the boy ""This looks like an interesting town. Maybe we should check it out."" It feels like Mike takes things simply and eventually, he likes the companion.The movie experiences a plot twist since they enter the little town. Our travelers receive a load of warm hospitality by the middle-aged widow Marta (Natalia Traven) who runs the cantina in the town. Mike finally finds out his long-lost romantic moment with the help of Marta. Hopefully, they do not end up like Robert and Francesca.Being a Clint Eastwood western, the movie should include some scenes with Clint on a horse. Fulfilling this fact, Clint appears not only on a horse but also breaks some wild ones (with the stunt double). According to Clint, he being a 91 years old man riding a horse caused some nerves on set since he has not been on a horse since Unforgiven. But, the rodeo hero, Mike looks comfortable to be back on horse, displaying his macho side.The movie has many stories ""from long time ago"". But it is quite simple and any attempt to dig deeper ruins its beauty. Mike is a lone wolf who is a reminder of a world that once was. Rafo is a broken spirit who is looking for someone to trust. The mixture of these two is the reason for the success of the story. The mutual understanding and trust between the characters build up the strong relationship which is the main theme of the movie. They both are strong in their own ways. Rafo is fulfilling his need of father figure by Mike while Mike is returning to be a family guy.The character of Mike senses like some kind of a mirrored image of Clint Eastwood himself. Clint's life in westerns and he being an animal lover are some highlighted facts in the character of Mike. ""This macho thing is overrated,"" Mike says. ""You think you have all the answers, but then you get older and realize you don't have any. By the time you figure it out, it's too late."" It feels like these words are originally by Clint Eastwood not by Mike.The stunning views of Western sunrises and beautiful desert plains alternate with the scenes, captured by Ben Davis add more beauty to the story. Mark Mancina's music illuminates the feelings and emotions of every frame. Though Natalia, Yoakam, Fernanda have lesser parts in the movie since the story mainly runs with the characters of Mike and Rafo, their performances are incredible. The portrayal of the 13 years old Rafo by Minet is elegant. Eventually, Eastwood does his part in his style. The chemistry between the old man and the young boy is gorgeously presented by the two actors.Looking through Clint Eastwood's filmography, it always involves with gunfights, car chases, violence, justice and catchphrases. Cry Macho may not tick all the boxes for you. But if the old man takes the wheel, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Cry Macho

This is an easy, enjoyable watch about a cowboy beyond his prime who does a little soul searching while on a mission. If you go into it understanding that it isn't a Michael Bay action thriller, you will set more realistic expectations.

Watching a weak, arthritic arm and fist limply punch a bad guy was cringe worthy. In real life that would have gotten Eastwood killed.

Fortunately, it was free on HBO max for me. Clint Eastwood is one of the best actors of any generation, and it was miserable to watch this movie knowing it could be his last. The only thing worse than the acting is the plot. A shady Dwight Yoakam asks his 90 year old former employee to travel to Mexico to kidnap his son. The only thing missing was a unicorn for Clint Eastwood to fly on to get to Mexico. Sure, there are some vintage Eastwood tough guy talk moments but how can anyone take him serious in this role at the age of 90. It is sort of like Biden being the President, in which Eastwood is well past his prime to be considered for any type of role like this. There is a reason it took so long for this movie to be made, and after watching it I know why. Is Dwight Yoakam the best co-star the studio could get? Was Randy Travis unavailable?I wish he ended his acting career on a high note, but this is probably the worst movie he ever made. It was painful to watch him walk in this movie, hunched over and in need of a walker.

440,TantraLover,I love Clint - but he shouldn't have made this movie,2,22 September 2021,"REVIEW OF ""CRY MACHO""I love Clint Eastwood, but he shouldn't have made this movie. It's like a big ego trip - ""look at me, I can still act, pretend to be a tough guy, pretend to be attractive to women...""The writing (dialogue) and acting are not good.But worse, there are many huge logical gaps in the story - for example:(1) How does Mike find the boy at a cock fight, when there are probably dozens of cock fights in a huge city like Mexico City? Mexico City is not a little village - it's almost 10 million people. For example, if I only knew that you played poker in backroom games in New York city, what are the odds that I'd find the right poker game in an evening? In a month? Ever?(2) And how does Mike then recognize a 13-year-old boy from his picture taken when he was 6?(3) When Mike walks away from his vehicle in the countryside, why does he leave the keys in the ignition so it can be stolen - when Mexico is famous for crime on its country roads? Who leaves their keys in the car most anywhere?(4) Why do they sit in that little town for weeks when they're so close to the Texas border? Why don't they get the car repaired? The boy's father has money enough to fix the leak.(5) Why does the boy's father put up with them taking weeks, without any explanation? Why doesn't he just send a friend across the border to get them, or have their car fixed?(6) Watching how the character Mike walks (and dances), and his history of a broken back, it's difficult to believe that he could break wild horses without breaking his old, brittle bones. Talking to animals, calming animals, healing them - yes. Physically breaking wild horses - no. That's just Clint Eastwood crying ""macho"".(7) Why do the Federales never check the license plates and figure out that they're driving stolen cars?(8) Why do the police never ask for license and registration, and figure out he's the man and kid they're looking for?(9) How does the mother's goon find them on a side road close to the border (toward the end)?(10) How does the black Mercedes that banged into them and knocked them off the road, afterward (at the border and parked in front of the cafe) not have a single scratch or dent on the passenger side that hit them?(11) How does Mike let the kid go with his father, knowing the father is going to trade the kid back to his mother in return for some money from a property sale, where the kid will again be abused (or run away to the street life like before)? Isn't he condoning child abuse?I could name more of these. The story just strains credibility, and it isn't good enough, or powerful enough in it's ending message, to justify overlooking all it's logical holes. These holes just insult my intelligence and my emotions.I watched it all the way through, rooting for Clint and the movie, but in the end I felt cheated, like I wasted my time, and was taken on an ego ride by Clint Eastwood. Even the title doesn't make much sense - it's not a movie about being macho.

But there's no way a 91 year old man is going to go to Mexico and get some kid. That's just ridiculous. You should have just cooked the roster at the beginning and ended the movie there.,Cry Macho

Of course he has had some misfires in his career, and I don't love everything about him. And yet, I feel like generations of film and culture students will study his work and find much to praise. His gaze is still powerful. Interesting relationships with younger characters; everything with more meaning because of the history of this man as an actor, director and cowboy. Grateful that he has so much work worth revisiting and exploring.",Cry Macho

475,wjhilton-26727,A worthy addition to the Eastwood Cannon,7,25 September 2021,"My wife and I saw ""Cry Macho"" opening day at the first showing as I've been anxiously awaiting to see it since it was announced last year. I went into it knowing full well that this was not going to be another Dirty Harry or Man With No Name action flick. I was just grateful to know that I was getting to see my favorite actor one more time in front of the camera. He's made some great movies that he didn't act in but there's nothing like seeing Clint in a new movie. The man was 90 years old when he did this last year so I give him a pass for looking a bit frail and slower paced these days. We thought it was a nice story that had a great moral lesson to it with many warm and tender moments. The majority of reviews picked it apart like a pack of buzzards for every little thing such as the acting, the predictability of the story, how slow it was and how some scenes were just too unbelievable to take it seriously. The acting was nothing spectacular but was very good in many parts. I thought the acting was worse in Gran Torino but it didn't seem to ruin it for me or most people who saw that. This was a story kicking around since the late 70's and movies were a bit more predictable then....surprise! I think too many people are over stimulated with today's CGI, non-stop action movies to slow down and really enjoy a good human interest story about an older man taking a young, confused teenager under his wing and teaching him some good life lessons. One complaint I read about over and over was how unbelievable the mother trying to seduce Clint was at his age. First of all, her character was half drunk and it seemed more about having power over him than anything sexual going on. Another is the punch Clint threw knocking down the thug. I'll grant you that might be a bit over the top but again, this is a Hollywood movie where fights are pretty embellished all the time so I can overlook this one. There were some real tender moments like when Clint and the kid were sleeping in the Shrine and Clint explained how his life was in shambles after his wife and child died and his boss gave him a reason to live saying ""You're the payback kid"". I believe Clint got pretty emotional in that scene. When he and Martha were dancing and the beautiful Spanish music played, it was very nice to watch 2 older people fall in love like they were kids again.I guess there is a lot of nostalgia watching a new Clint Eastwood movie for me since my Dad and I loved to watch them together as I was growing up and even into adulthood. Since my Dad is no longer with us, it always brings back some great memories. I think a lot of the bad reviews were written by people who are still butt-hurt over Clint talking to the ""empty chair"" . In any case, I've watched it 4 more times on HBO and I've enjoyed it more each time. I don't understand why people can't just settle down and enjoy it as it was intended. Is it an instant classic? No. Is it among his best work? No. It was an enjoyable little film that Clint didn't have to give us, he's not doing it for the money obviously but for the love of entertaining people with his art.",Cry Macho
476,jennkaypope,Meh.,3,26 September 2021,"Clint Eastwood is one of the greatest, but you can only do so much with so little. The story is trite, shallow, & predictable, probably because the novel was published in 1975 & not updated for today's audiences. Besides Eastwood, Traven, & Macho, the acting is amateurish, including Yoakam who doesn't usually do so poorly. Having loved Grand Torino & The Mule, I was really disappointed to have wasted an hour & forty-four minutes on this. My high hopes were dashed pretty quickly but I kept watching because I thought surely at some point it would improve. It didn't.",Cry Macho
477,keithmacbook,Ugh,2,26 September 2021,"Bad bad bad, it was just all around bad. Mr E is too old to be even acting like any of the women in this film would be into him.

480,npuccetticpa,HORRIBLE!!!!,1,18 September 2021,"There aren't words to describe how awfully bad this movie is... except it's 104 minutes of pure torture. It's horrible all the way around starting with the script that's chalk full of contrived dialogue. Acting is horrendous by all in it starting with Dwight Yokum who never had a lick of acting talent. Eastwood is probably at his worst in this and the kid is cringingly horrible. I'd be furious if I had paid to see this movie (thanks HBO Max). However I do resent that I was robbed of 104 minutes of my life. Frankly I'd have turned it off after 20 minutes but I kept waiting for it to get even a smidgen better. Sadly it only got worse. Sad end to Eastman's career, he should have quit while he was ahead. One star is being kind!",Cry Macho
