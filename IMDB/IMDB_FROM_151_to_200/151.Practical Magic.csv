0,SnoopyStyle,Witches' Brew of Mismatch Genre,4,9 March 2014,"Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian Owens (Nicole Kidman) have been told by their aunts (Stockard Channing, Dianne Wiest) early on about the family curse. Their ancestor Maria Owens was hung as a witch, but she survives. She was exiled to what is now their home Maria's Island in Massachusetts with her unborn child. She casts a spell to never fall in love. The curse has endured killing all the men that Owens women love. Gillian is the wild child and she wanders away from home. Sally stayed home. Against all odds, she falls in love with her husband and has two girls. Everything seems fine until the curse strike her husband dead. Then drunken mess Gillian calls one night for help. Gillian's boyfriend Jimmy (Goran Visnjic) takes both sisters hostage. Sally tries to dose Jimmy with belladonna but an overdose kills him. So they bury his body in the yard. Police detective Gary Hallet (Aidan Quinn) comes investigating the missing Jimmy. Only Jimmy's spirit is now haunting the sisters.This movie is a witches' brew of mismatch genres. It wants so desperately to be a rom-com. But there are some really dark fantasy elements that would probably be better off as a thriller. And then there are real slices of horror. It's a wildly inconsistent mess. For so much of it, director Griffin Dunne is using such a delicate light touch to the tone that all the murder and mayhem seems weirdly fake. Bullock and Kidman are great actors who has good chemistry together as sisters. However, the chemistry between Bullock and Quinn is questionable. The main reason being that the love may be spell induced. I just don't know what to do with this mess.",Practical Magic
1,mark.waltz,Women become witches because men are jerks or far too nice. Take your pick.,3,19 April 2016,"A fabulous foursome of award winning actresses couldn't save this amoral view of the dark side of the gentle sex, minus the morality and right over wrong viewpoint of ""The Witches"" and ""Hocus Pocus"". Veterans Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest are the eccentric spell casting aunts who take in orphaned nieces and turn them to the light side of the dark side. Growing up to be Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, they end up in bad relationships thanks to an ancient curse where any man who marries into their family will die a tragic death. Of course, Bullock ends up with two daughters (obviously no sons allowed), and the pattern threatens to be repeated.Sweetly filmed, there is still nothing that hides the fact that this really is spiritually ugly. Even in the two films that I mentioned, as well as 'The Witches of Eastwick"", there was no denying the fact that the witches actually were up to no good. Here the two older aunts are presented as fun- loving Auntie Mame types, and the two younger women are presented in such heroic aspects that it is difficult to see past the fact that they are involved in dark forces. A scene where Channing and Wiest meet with a client determined to make a man fall in love with her just gives the insinuation that a woman has to turn to the dark side in order to find love in her life, and that is a very disturbing precedent, especially in a film that has such a family air about it. One of the major issues with this ""chick flick"" is that it doesn't really do any service to the advancement of women and any reason to take stories like this seriously. Certainly, Bullock's ill-fated marriage to a really nice man is emotional, but the one dimensional lover that Kidman ends up is written with absolutely no redeeming values. Aidan Quinn, as a detective on the sister's trail, is believable with a variation of qualities, but his sudden transformation under a witches spell falls short of believable. The gathering of local women in the conclusion is very anti- male, and the very final scene proves that this was just an attempt to sugarcoat what the witchy women of this family was really all about. While I can enjoy films which tackle horrific, supernatural or macabre subject matters, I strongly believe that the movies have a strong obligation to present certain ideas in a moralistic manner. There is nothing moral about showing unnatural ways of controlling another human being, and certainly any kind of magical spell to control nature is wrong. I'm guilty of adoring Channing and Wiest too much to judge them, and the fact that I liked them so much in this was very disturbing to me. They ain't no ""Rosemary's Baby"" type coven, and certainly not getting the come-uppance of the three sisters from ""Hocus Pocus"" made this questionable as to the motives of the filmmakers. And when they say that there's no devil in their craft, the only word that I can think of in response is, ""Bull!""",Practical Magic
2,gavin6942,Something of a Precursor to American Horror Story,6,11 December 2015,"The wry, comic romantic tale follows the Owens sisters, Sally and Gillian, as they struggle to use their hereditary gift for practical magic to overcome the obstacles in discovering true love.I have to give this film a 6 rather than a 7 or 8, because it seems like it was trying to go in different directions, which made it never strong enough as any one genre. It could be fantasy, but it's not. It could be PG-13 horror, but it's not. It could be romantic comedy, but it's not. There should have been something more here than what we got.What is interesting is the inclusion of music from Stevie Nicks, the ""White Witch"". This makes me think the film had to be a strong influence on the writers of ""American Horror Story"". The hereditary witches, the mixing of potions, bringing the dead back... and Stevie Nicks. This can't just be written off as generic witch stuff.",Practical Magic
3,jboothmillard,Practical Magic,4,3 November 2008,"I would need to see it again to write a better review, but this is the basics and what I remember. Sisters Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian Owens (Nicole Kidman) are witches, Gillian is the wild one with abusive boyfriend Jimmy Angelov (Ice Age's Goran Visnjic), and Sally is the home-loving one falling for detective Gary Hallet (Legends of the Fall's Aidan Quinn), who is trying to find Angelov. Also in the story are the Owens witchy aunts, Frances (Grease's Stockard Channing) and Jet (Edward Scissorhands' Dianne Wiest). Apparently this is meant to be a black comedy, but I don't remember laughing, so obviously seeing it again would help. Okay!",Practical Magic
4,moonspinner55,Mild magic...,4,30 December 2006,"Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are well-cast as estranged sisters in the present day who reunite, only to become involved in a murder, covering their tracks while dodging an out-of-town cop who's hot on the case. After rocketing to stardom with her co-starring role in ""Speed"", Sandra Bullock has struggled with her celebrity and the results on-screen have been mixed, to say the least (""While You Were Sleeping"" was cute, but I barely made it through ""28 Days"", which felt like it). ""Practical Magic"" is a mild fantasy with dramatic and comedic overtones, admirably more of a character-study than a special effects-induced outing (which probably turned many viewers off). The attempt is certainly there, the production design is handsome, but the characters don't really come off. Bullock is truly appealing, though Kidman and Aidan Quinn have very little to work with, and the supporting actresses (Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest) are forgettable, much like the film. It's a time-filler, leaving no lasting impression. *1/2 from ****",Practical Magic
5,blanche-2,Light and entertaining,8,13 July 2009,"Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest indulge in some ""Practical Magic,"" a 1998 film directed by Griffin Dunne. Bullock and Kidman play sisters, Sally and Gillian, both of whom are witches. One (Kidman) is free-wheeling and out in the world, and Bullock is a widowed mother with children who refuses to have anything to do with magic. One of their ancestors put a curse on any man involved with a woman in her family, and the curse lost the sisters their father and Bullock's husband. Her two aunts, however, Francis and Bridget (Channing and Wiest) still practice their spells. When Gillian takes up with the wrong man (again) (Goran Visjnic), she calls Sally. As a result of Sally's help, they find themselves in a lot of trouble and have to take drastic measures. Things don't work out as planned.I'm not sure what the problem is - it appears that some people on IMDb expect every film to be Magnolia, and if it isn't, they reject it as junk. This movie is what it is intended to be - light, with some suspense, some scares, some fun, lots of warmth, and great characters. If you read the book, disappointment is more understandable, and I feel your pain.The acting is excellent, with four top actresses as the stars, and the relationships between them are excellent as well. As others have mentioned, the best part of the film is when they start calling neighbors so they can have a coven.Highly recommended.",Practical Magic
6,edwagreen,Practical Magic: How Stupid Can We Get? 0*,1,7 November 2009,"This movie is beyond the pits.Stop already with the Salem witch trials, condemnation and the ultimate curses placed by witches that are inherited through the years.This picture was almost a dumb take-off of Hocus-Pocus of several years back.Hard to believe that great actresses Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest would play two relatively benign aunts in this horrible mess.The curse is that through the ages, a beetle comes along to bring the demise to husbands of the women. Their children are ostracized by others.Sandra Bullock tries hard but she has such ridiculous material to work with. Nicole Kidman doesn't even look like herself as she vamps around. How many times do you have to kill her boyfriend? 3 strikes and you're out in baseball. This hodge-podge of a movie shouldn't have even reached strike 1.",Practical Magic
7,view_and_review,Miss Me With This,2,2 December 2020,The opening scene a narrator was telling the story of their ancestor Maria. She was a witch. She escaped a hanging. She waited for her love and he never showed. She was devastated. She then cast a spell that love would never come near her again. This spell became a curse for her and all of her female descendants.That's all I needed to hear to know where this movie was going. I watched about an hour more just to see if I was wrong then turned it off. Just another romance story of a different color. Miss me with this one.,Practical Magic
8,anaconda-40658,Practically Works With Leads and Visuals.,6,16 December 2015,"Practical Magic (1998): Dir: Griffin Dunne / Cast: Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, Aiden Quinn, Dianne Wiest, Stockard Channing: Black comedy that may be referencing Sandra Bullock and her practical daily living or her instructions to her children not to use magic. It can mean love, which is much more powerful than magic. Bullock and Nicole Kidman are sisters plagued by their mother's curse after dying of a broken heart. It is said that any males they love will surely die. Bullock is married and has two children until her husband is struck by a truck. Kidman hangs loose until her boyfriend becomes abusive. Held at gunpoint Bullock accidentally poisons him. Bullock states that there is no devil in magic. She obviously obtains her's out of a box of Lucky Charms. Witchcraft is treated as a game as oppose to dangerous. Director Griffin Dunne bypasses predictable storytelling with exquisite visual elements. This is an improvement over his previous film Addicted to Love, but neither films clash humour and their dark elements very successfully. Bullock and Kidman survive the hocus-pocus bullshit with fine chemistry but Aiden Quinn as the investigating officer is standard. Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing play their crazy aunts. Despite its seemingly free spirit attitude, this film is not for children. Interesting yet unfocused, which fades the real magic. Score: 6 / 10",Practical Magic
9,The_Void,Just as disappointing as you've heard it is,5,26 September 2005,"I decided to ignore the negative comments that this film has received and just make up my own mind. After all, witchcraft is always an intriguing subject and films with two strong female leads often interest me...but I'm sad to say, this is one of those occasions where it's better to listen to what you've heard. Actually, for the first hour or so; Practical Magic isn't all that bad. It's not all that good, but it sets itself up well, and constantly seems to be hinting that better is to come. The plot revolves around two witches bringing one of their boyfriends back to life, and I thought that once this got put into action, the film was going to pick up more; but to my surprise, once the plot gets going; the film just falls apart. Throughout the film, we know that the family of witches is hated by the local community because they're ""different"" - yet once we get past the halfway point, the neighbourhood is coming round to help the girls cast a spell! This is just one of the inconsistencies of this film, and throughout I got the impression that Practical Magic doesn't think much of it's audience's intelligence.The plot revolves around two girls that are witches. They grow up into Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman; the former being happily married to a man she loves, while the latter has found herself in all sorts of trouble with a nasty boyfriend played by Goran Visnijic. However, a curse on the family means that any man they love will meet an untimely death, and that's what happens to Sandra Bullock's husband. Kidman's boyfriend dies too, only it's by her hands and despite trying to bring him back to life; he becomes an evil entity that haunts the sisters. It doesn't sound all that engrossing, and it isn't. The plot has the potential to give way to an interesting flick, but it's themes are all over the place and, as mentioned, the film becomes ridiculous after we get past the halfway point. The two leads are good, however, and give the film it's only solid positive element. Casting Diane Wiest as an aging aunt was something of a stroke of genius, as I cant think of anyone that fits the bill better - but generally speaking, any form of genius is something that this film is very much lacking.",Practical Magic
10,SimonJack,Was the comedy label to help market this dud?,2,6 September 2019,"The only reason I purchased the DVD of ""Practical Magic"" was because it was billed as a comedy first and foremost. And, drama and fantasy with comedy has been known to work in movies in the past. So, what a let-down and utter sham this movie turned out to be.For comedy there is the beating of a woman (fortunately it doesn't show much of this, only the physical damage on Nicole Kidman's face), an attempted strangling of a woman by a guy gone nuts, a couple living out of cesspools in motels (thankfully, not too much of the film), a couple of killings (if not murders), and a guy getting hit and killed by a truck. With tongue in cheek, one must note all the chuckles and humor in that.There is the drama, of course, in the girl being frightened of the guy who beats her up, and in the vehicle death. There may be more, but it's hard to tell the way this film moves in and out of the fantasy in witchcraft and sorcery. But that may be where the producers intended the humor to be - because the film treats some of the occult stuff rather whimsically.This story is supposed to be based on a novel. If the book is half as convoluted as this film is, it would be a wonder if anyone would read the whole thing. This is one goofy, twisted and mix of a film with a mostly plotless story. That might be what one should expect when filmmakers begin dabbling with the occult for movie plots. It's too bad the writers couldn't do better than this.I was surprised that Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman - two talented actresses, would take on the roles they did in such a lousy screenplay. Stockard Channing is another very talented actress, but this type of strange stuff is more up her alley. It's not that movies about witches or magic and such fantasy can't be good and entertaining. Those that have had genuine comedy have been quite good and fared very well. My favorite early such film, was ""Bell, Book and Candle"" of1958, with Jimmy Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon, Elsa Lanchester and Ernie Kovacs. And for fantasy with comedy and drama and more with witches, who could ever forget or not enjoy ""The Wizard of Oz) of 1939?""Practical Magic"" was a flop. It barely covered half of its $75 million budget in the U. S. box office. The promoters should be taken to task for advertising this as a comedy. Hollywood sometimes is as much a shyster as a subject or person it characterizes as such in its films.",Practical Magic
11,whpratt1,DIANNE WIEST'S SQUINTY WITCH EYES SAVED THIS PICTURE!,10,25 May 2003,"Sandra Bullock(Sally Owens)(""Murder by Number 2002"") and Nicole Kidman(Gillian Owens)(""Dead Calm"" '89) as sister's were fantastic in their acting skills together.  They both did dramatic roles, comedy and very sexy romantic roles, they made it look so easy to act in these rather difficult roles to play. It actually looked like they had a ball making this picture and I am sure they did!  Dianne Wiest (Oscar winner for:""Bullets over Broadway 94'"" and ""Hannah & Her Sisters'86) was a fantastic Witch with her famous SQUINTY EYES which made her acting role very believeable.   This was a very funny and fast moving picture that does not need any criticism, just try acting out these characters on stage yourself!   Enjoy viewing this great film, it takes you away from reality and makes you a kid again.",Practical Magic
12,JamesHitchcock,If this film were a person it would have a severe case of multiple personality disorder.,3,23 April 2008,"We are all familiar with films that feature magic and witchcraft in fairy-tale or fantasy settings. ""Practical Magic"", however, is one of those films (other examples include ""The Witches of Eastwick"", ""The Craft"" and ""Bewitched"") which make use of magic and witchcraft in an otherwise realistic, modern-day American setting. Sisters Sally and Gillian Owens are two modern-day American witches. Besides the hereditary ability to perform magic, their family also live under a hereditary curse, placed on them by a distant ancestress. Any man with whom they fall in love is doomed to die young, but this does not prevent Sally from falling in love with, and marrying, a young man named Michael.And then one day she sees a beetle in their kitchen. Now you and I might think a beetle portends nothing more serious than ""time to call the pest control people"", but to witches it is apparently a harbinger of death, so Sally rips up the kitchen floorboards in an attempt to squash the pesky critter before it can work its evil magic. Unfortunately, too late. It might have been a nicely ironic touch to have Michael come into the kitchen at this point and either fall to his death through the hole in the floor or to drop dead from a heart attack brought on by the sight of the devastation his wife has wrought, but the scriptwriters evidently lacked any gift for irony, and Michael dies in a road accident.Gillian is also experiencing problems with the man in her life, although of a rather different nature. Her Bulgarian boyfriend, Jimmy, is a violent and abusive thug. (Jimmy was originally intended to be a Texan, but the script was altered when the Croatian Goran Visnjic was cast in the role. No-one, however, could be bothered to think of an authentically Bulgarian Christian name, so Jimmy he remained). The sisters accidentally kill Jimmy while attempting to prevent him from beating Gillian, but manage to use their magic powers to bring him back to life. The resuscitated Jimmy, however, proves to be even more of a thug than he was before, so they are forced to kill him a second time. Being twice-dead, however, does not prevent Jimmy's spirit from coming back to haunt the sisters, and they are forced to call on all their powers to try and get rid of him for good. An added complication is that Sally finds herself falling for Gary, the young police officer investigating Jimmy's death, and wonders whether the curse will also claim him.Nicole Kidman is one of those actresses I am never quite sure about. She was a promising newcomer in her early Australian days (""Dead Calm"", ""Flirting"") and has given some good performances in recent films such as ""The Others"", ""Cold Mountain"" and ""The Golden Compass"". During her ""Mrs Cruise"" years, however, she seemed to struggle, perhaps under the burden of trying to prove that she was something more than the beautiful trophy wife of a big name, the Bo Derek of the nineties. Even in a film as good as ""Eyes Wide Shut"" she failed to shine, and many of her other films (""Far and Away"", ""Batman Forever"", ""The Peacemaker"") were very dull affairs. ""Practically Tragic"", however, must be one of her worst, down in the pits with the ghastly ""Moulin Rouge"".Why do I hate this film? Well, let me count the ways. The film might deal with things magical, but there is little magic about the dull and turgid script. The plot is particularly preposterous, even by the standards of most films dealing with the supernatural, the ending being particularly nonsensical. Given that most people these days do not believe in magic, a fantasy of this nature can only succeed if the audience can be persuaded to suspend their disbelief, and that is something this film singularly fails to do. Neither Kidman as Gillian nor Sandra Bullock ever manages to make their characters believable, or even very likable. Many films about the supernatural- the ""Harry Potter"" movies are a good example- use magic as a metaphor for the human condition; the witch or wizard may have superhuman abilities, but still has the human knowledge of good and evil and the human responsibility to choose between them. There is no hint of that here; the film seems to take place in a moral vacuum.My biggest problem with the film, however, was that it just did not know what attitude to take towards its subject-matter, whether to take it seriously or as a subject for comedy. It is a hodge-podge of various film genres, borrowing something of the conventions of each one, and ending up as an unattractive hybrid, neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. Some of the time the film is played for laughs, but it is hard to regard as a comedy (except perhaps a very black one) a film which includes in an early scene shots of a young husband and father being mown down by a truck in front of his wife. This board describes the film as a ""Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Mystery / Romance"", which can be extended to """"Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Mystery / Romance / Horror / Thriller / Feminist Tract"". (The scenes between Sally and Jimmy read like a poor man's ""Thelma and Louise""). If this film were a person it would have a severe case of multiple personality disorder. 3/10",Practical Magic

Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman along with veteran actresses Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest with a strong supporting role from Goran Visnjic form a delightful, lighthearted romp in witchcraft. At the same time dramatic and horror elements are carefully and smoothly introduced that balanced this overall entertaining movie.

17,filipemanuelneto,Poorly developed characters in an initially promising film.,4,21 February 2017,"This comic movie revolves around the loves of Sally and Gillian, two young witches who are raised by their aunts on an isolated island. They are unhappy in love due to a cruel curse. The film is supposed to be a romantic comedy with a supernatural background, but the plot cuts off almost every developmental path in romance, which turns out to be very fragile. In a romantic comedy, the plot must privilege the development of a love story strong enough to support the plot... but that never happens here. The two female characters want it, but neither does magic make the male characters rise to the challenge. They always seem totally secondary in all plot. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman were both very well and gave the two witches, the main characters of the film, tremendous strength and personality. They were well supported by Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest, who played the two aunts. The problem is the boys: Goran Visnjic and Aidan Quinn have never been well in the film, perhaps because the script did not help the actors' work at all. It's too bad.",Practical Magic

20,FiendishDramaturgy,Sweetly enjoyable.,7,19 August 2003,"I'm sure I'm not the only Magick User to review this movie, but if you're interested in a pagan view, here it is. If not, have a nice day.""There is no devil in the Craft."" How wonderful to hear those words come out of Sandra Bullock's mouth! I was simply delighted.I'm not going to sit here and waste your time with the plot. The movie's been out since 1998 and most of you already know it. If you haven't seen the movie, the rest of the reviews gives you the plot, ad nauseum.Nicole Kidman's character, Gillian Owens, is played wonderfully as a seductress. It was a bit stereotypical (remember the flighty Wiccan in Blair Witch 2?), but well played by Kidman.I did not like the use of Belladonna, as it is used in the movie. It portrays a dark intent, which is something anyone in the Craft will tell you is strictly against the rules. However, it is a tendency in Gillian's (Kidman's) character to be drawn towards the dark path, and was therefore fitting.And who can't identify with Sandra Bullock's Sally Owens wanting nothing more than to be ""normal?"" Who IS normal? WHAT is normal? Love is normal. And that's all she wants is to love unequivocally and receive that love in return. And then there's ""The Owens Family Curse."" We all have ours. Some bald early, some have the unbelievably spacious nose inherited from ""Uncle Elmer."" My family curse is the lack of child-bearing women in My family, hence I am the last of My mother's family. She had only Me and I have bore no live children. At least she didn't put the usual curse on Me. (The ""I hope you have a kid JUST LIKE YOU!"" curse.).The idea of Sally (Bullock) owning/operating a botanical shop, ""I manufacture bath oils,"" is spot on. Many Magick Users long to do something along those lines.Sally and Gillian's bringing back Gillian's lover (Goran Visnjic) from the dead (?!) ""We don't do that."" (Dianne Wiest as ""Auntie"" Bridget Owens) That spell book would have had to have been passed down from at least 5 generations, if not more to even HAVE a spell like that within its bindings. That having been said, those ""in the Craft"" don't do that. Most CAN'T do that, and those who can...well...shouldn't. Necromancy is of the Dark Arts, and is no part of the Craft. And finally, the ending.The ending was quite fantastic and over the top. Insanity, if you ask Me, but ... no one did.Jumping off the roof of their house, in full witch regalia complete with pointy hats, bucked shoes and red and white-striped stockings, and floating down to the ground safely and slowly, FLOATING! down like that...put a fantasy-styled ending to what otherwise would have been a big boost for Pagans in the mundane world.It's a very entertaining story, and contains great portrayals by.... Sandra Bullock .... Sally Owens Nicole Kidman .... Gillian Owens Stockard Channing .... Frances Owens Dianne Wiest .... Bridget Owens Evan Rachel Wood .... Kylie Owens Alexandra Artrip .... Antonia Owens ...right up until the ending. But the ending doesn't negate the entire movie. It just degraded its value far more than Pagans would have liked. It still gets a 7.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Practical Magic

She shows Girl Power by pointing out that normal is hard enough' the message of the film, it is this: ""Do not deny yourself and act according to your own nature, only then will you be truly happy"". A chick flick with a bit more substance than average.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are wickedly sexy as the spell-casting sisters doomed to be single for the rest of their natural life. Raised on chocolate cake and midnight margaritas buy there aunts ! I felt the camaraderie of the moment as the two sisters and their aunts got drunk on ""midnight margaritas"" while dancing to Harry Nilsson's ""Lime in the Coconut."" It was just plain light fun. Best scene in the whole darn movie. The film has a great sound track to boot .With Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock as the sisters and Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest as their 'bohemian' aunts it can't fail to provide a diverting couple of hours. I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of fluff.Practical Magic - Midnight MargaritasBest scene in the whole darn movie.Fun fact they actually got drunk for this scene Nicole Kidman brought cheap tequilia and they all got hammered 😂",Practical Magic
22,smatysia,Did not coalesce into a good movie,5,30 May 2015,"It's hard to put my finger on exactly what went wrong with this movie. Many critics said things like ""it doesn't know what it wants to be"" or ""it is mixing genres"". I don't really see anything wrong with mixing genres. It can make a film more original and less formulaic. It just seemed that most of the cast just lacked chemistry with one another. This is odd because these are very talented actors. Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock just didn't ring true in their roles as sisters. Neither did Aiden Quinn or Goran Visnjic. The real chemistry was with the older sisters, the crazy aunts, played very well by Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest. In spite of some good stuff, it did not coalesce into a good movie.",Practical Magic
23,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Magical Sandra Bullock movie!,9,12 August 2008,"Even though I haven't read the book, if you ask me, PRACTICAL MAGIC is a magical Sandra Bullock movie. At the beginning of the film, when Kylie and Antonia (Evan Rachel Wood and Alexandra Artrip) I wanted to slap the kids doing it. If you want to know why, you'll have to see the movie to see for yourself. Whenever a spell occurred, I was very impressed. It's hard to explain why. All in all, this is a magical Sandra Bullock movie. In addition, the soundtrack is really good, too. Now, in conclusion, if you like Sandra Bullock or Nicole Kidman films or enjoyed Alice Hoffman's title novel, I highly recommend this movie.

24,davispittman,Kind of a let down,5,2 October 2015,"Practical Magic is a 1998 comedy film starring Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock. This film is about the 2 stars trying to escape a curse set by their ancestor on any man that loves an Owens woman. The movie does have some pretty cool looking special effects, and there is very good chemistry between all the characters in the movie. Although the film's plot seems a bit jumbled and unfocused. The movie's comedy falls flat many times even though the characters are likable. At a few points I was confused as to what the movie was actually about. Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing gave good performances as the two aunts that take in Nicole and Sandra as children after both their mother and father pass away. Like I said, the movie seems a little bit confused and some people might become bored with the movie, as I did at one point. Really the only thing I enjoyed about Practical Magic was the characters played by some of my favorite actors and actresses. 5/10",Practical Magic
25,rooprect,"A dark comedy, chick flick style",7,22 January 2014,"I hate using labels like ""chick flick"", but one look at the IMDb voting demographics shows that this is literally a chick flick. As of the time I'm writing this, females rate it nearly 2 points higher than males, and in the under 18 group it's even more exaggerated.Well I'm a guy, and I dug it. If you're flexible enough to appreciate the macho man cheesiness of ""Commando"" (like Arnold Schwarzenegger riding on the landing gear of a Boeing 747) as well as the chick flick cheesiness of ""Pretty Woman"" (like Richard Gere riding on the sunroof of a white limo) ...both of which are equal in amounts of cheese but from different perspectives... then I think you can have a fun time watching ""Practical Magic"". Why? Because it seems to hit us with both extremes.On the surface, the story seems to be brewing a sinister dark comedy: the Owens women just can't seem to keep men long before they kick the bucket. Tons of potential for a slightly demented ""Beetlejuice"" kinda story, or even ""Heathers"". But instead of going in that direction (i.e. treating death as crazy joke), ""Practical Magic"" takes it quite seriously and is not afraid to get pretty sentimental on the subject. In other words, it takes a very morbid ""guy flick"" story but treats it with ""chick flick"" sensitivity.And that's just the beginning. We haven't gotten to the other dark themes of wife beating, alcohol abuse, sexual promiscuity, murder and re-murder. So, you ask, if it has all these disturbing themes and refuses to make light of them, how the heck can this be a comedy? The answer is that the leading ladies, not just Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman but also their crazy aunts played by Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest, act their roles with playful humor and endearing wit. It reminded me a little of ""Sex and the City"", the way the stories can be downright upsetting, but the humor comes in the way the characters behave despite it all. ""Practical Magic"" doesn't rely on a silly story for its laughs but instead lets the acting pave the way for levity.Roger Ebert gave this movie a mostly negative review, saying ""the movie doesn't seem sure what tone to adopt, veering uncertainly from horror to laughs to romance."" But I think Ebert failed to see that the film's charm is the fact that the characters can indulge in laughs and romance *despite* the horror.Ebert also criticized: ""'Practical Magic' is too scary for children and too childish for adults. Who was it made for?"" The answer is it's made for adults who can indulge in childishness. Basically if you get the gist of my review, it's the idea that this film is an unexpected blend of opposites. I have to admit it caught me off guard for a while, but I eventually figured out the rhythm and had a fun ride.Do NOT expect a sinister, dark comedy. Do NOT expect a totally light-hearted silly romp either. The best way I can describe it would be to compare it to some of the 80s horror-comedies like ""Fright Night"", ""Vamp"" or even ""Gremlins"" but with a dash of ""Thelma & Louise"". Throw em all together in a giant cauldron and have some fun.",Practical Magic

28,triple8,certainly not awful but lacked a certain something.,5,4 April 2004,"I can't say I hated practical magic but I wasn't all that crazy about it and I thought I would be since I'm a moderate Sandra Bullock fan and a MAJOR Nicole kidman fan. This is a movie that had me confused at the end of it. I still didn't know what my feelings were when it ended, only that something was missing from it to make it a truly wonderful movie viewing experience for me. This is certainly not awful but there are a few reasons why it didn't do all it could have for me.I've seen movies that movie way to slowly. That wasn't Practical magic's problem. Rather, the opposite. It went from this- to that- to the other so so quickly there was almost no specific order to anything, just when you think the movie's about one thing off in another direction it goes. I had no problem following it but didn't know what I was supposed to be following. Is it a romance? a film Noir, witch style? a drama about two sisters and family? a black comedy? a straight out horror? I wasn't sure(until the end frankly) what this movie was supposed to be about, it jumped around so much and there was little buildup to anything. I just felt, if there is such a thing as a movie moving to QUICKLY this was a prime example.Another problem was the music. Although I love the use of music in movies, to capture certain scenes and elements of a movie, I felt the music choices were a bit wrong here and didn't really add anything to the movie as a whole.That's not to say I didn't enjoy the captivating cinematography or amazing acting-Bullock and Kidman were good choices, they lit up the screen.Aiden Quinn is perfect in everything he does and this was no exception. The special effects were beautiful and amazing and The last scene in particular was wonderful.But I really didn't enjoy this all that much at all. I probably would not watch it again. It was cute, it had it's moments. It rates to me about a 5.5. But the lack of a specific organization to the storyline and the fact that I felt many scenes just fell flat prevented me from really getting into this, though it's not a BAD movie at all. My vote is 5.5 of 10.",Practical Magic
29,eric262003,Pleasant Film That Lacks Greatness,7,8 March 2020,"In the realms of the atmosphere that surrounds this movie from 1998, ""Practical Magic"" the girls, the ladies, the older ladies, witches and even Mother Earth has all the power and magic to lure you into their lives as they cast a spell on each of us to watch this film. The good does outweigh the bad here due to two mega superstar actresses sharing the spotlight with each other and working together without one trying to usurp each other. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman shine as sisters who have a special bond for each other and come from a long line of witches with the gift of magic that passed on to them and a curse given not to them, but the men who fall in love with them. Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist play their aunts, who enjoy casting spells and offer chocolate cake for breakfast for the sisters.And sure the spellbinding action and whimsical moments are at the peak of what makes this movie heavily entertaining, you just feel like you wish you expect Jack Nicholson reprise his role as Darryl Van Horne come at them and play seductive mind games with the characters particularly at Sally and Gillian Owens (Bullock and Kidman).Based off of novel by Alice Hoffman, ""Practical Magic"" explores not just the world of fictional witchcraft both the light side and the dark ones, but also has a certain elements of drama that deals with real issues that women are affected by. Such issues like commitments, abuse, fitting into society is all in there, but most people who wish to see it don't care about all that. They want to see magic, hexes and witchcraft and an epic climax between good and evil.And there's a love story behind this tale of spells and hexes, it's not as fully fleshed out and doesn't take too much space for non-fans of romantic melodramas. Just a word of warning, when there's a full moon and someone is flying around her broomstick, take caution, once the broom falls, trouble is just a motion away.It's when the situations these characters face is where this movie is problematic. Sometimes the cliches depicted here are so corny you can make popcorn out of all the corniness. In one of the more cliched witch story movie, the opening scenes take place in the 17th century where a young lady is about the sentenced to death by hanging during the infamous Salem Witch Trials. She then resurrects as a witch placing a curse on her family legacy that the women who marry will likely not have long-lasting relationship because their husbands will likely die shortly.With all that said, with her powers she managed to escape death by have the branch snapped just like a twig. Also why do these so-called witches in these Salem Witch Trial murders have to be pretty? Most them were downright ugly, unkempt and lived in condemned houses this close to be torn down.In another cliche that runs rampant in movies that are predominately female cast why does there always have to have a dance montage in at least one scene? In this case we have the ladies pull out an old record from the 1970's and they start dancing idiotically to Harry Nilsson's ""Lime in the Coconut"" song. Do they believe that women do this when their loved one's aren't watching them?Under the direction of Griffin Dunne, he makes out this movie like it's a celebration of girl power when really he's basically clueless and is just there to pander to the ever-growing need for women's empowerment. He gives us the impression that he's pro-feminist and that this movie is to encourage women to see this movie like it'll change their lives forever. Instead of a superficial male-feminist director, a tough-minded female director would've been better at telling this story.Dunne lubricates his movie by over injecting a cornucopia of musical montages especially during the scenes where Gillian parts way from the family to live a nomadic life of sexual adventures, while Sally wants to remain grounded and find a husband and start a family. Give credit Dunne, doesn't do that bad of a job directing as he gives a great performances by Channing and Wiest as the two aunts Frances and Jet who were perfect in their positions and can cast spells like no other.It's a fairly good balance to see two sisters with contrary perspectives in how they look at the world surrounding them. And while Kidman was excellent as the most laid-back with her wanting to go out on her own and find a path of her own and tempting a few guys along the way, it's a nice balance to have Bullock play Sally, who just wants to find happiness with a family of her own, but then faces heartbreak when her husband dies suddenly and we feel for her as she struggles emotionally to win back her smile. Both churn out effective performances that shows that life can be enjoyable and heartbreaking at the same time.No doubt, the chemistry within each performer is excellent in its delivery, and the story of Gillian's Easter European boyfriend stalking them and killing him by means of self-defense and burying him might captures a few moments of intrigue. This film stands out as being not a classic, but still a good watch on a boring day. Through all the flaws is wonderful story to be told.",Practical Magic

I think it is nice to know that one of my favorite scenes, the one where Gillian, Sally and their aunts are drunk, was a true and honest scene, since ''the actresses actually got drunk'',as the trivia's says...The plot: Sally and Gillian are sisters and are both witches, like her mother, her aunts and the women of their family. But they carry on a family legacy,that only leads the women to tragedy and sadness: all the men who get close to an Owens,eventually dies.(The women in the family never give birth to boys, by the way.)

This is fresh, upbeat, very sweet work, and it is very humorous, quick, very romantic in a true sense, and never drags. The scenery is pretty beautiful, and hey, the house is a real wonder here, you just feel like wishing you'd be living there! The script is nothing very difficult to grasp and this is the very mixture of various genres that makes this movie so endearing and ultimately watchable. I enjoyed the excellent performances of Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman - they did a very good job here, and they never forgot to be funny and even clumsy when necessary. Great and refreshing soundtrack made the watch even more exctiting and cool. There are several unanswered questions within the plot, but maybe the novel answered them, and I was just a bit perplexed.

33,Bob-45,Muddled Fun,6,13 June 2001,"There'se enough plot in ""Practical Magic"" to fill three movies (or, perhaps a television series).  That's the problem.  So much is going on, everything happens with minimal impact.  Though physically unconvincing as sisters, Nicole Kidman (terrific) and Sondra Bullock (fine) emote fine chemistry.  Far less effective are all of the male actors, whom seem to be there as plot devices and nothing more.WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILERWithout doubt, the weakest element of the film is the resolution of the family curse.  The ""exorcism"" is unconvincing, requiring previously unsympathetic characters to become ""nice"".  Worse, we are ask to believe the uniting of the women has somehow lifted the ""death curse"" without showing us any evidence to this truth. This plays to even lesser effect, since the main male romantic lead plays no part in this climactic scene.Even if somewhat lacking in the prerequisite magic, ""Practical Magic"" is muddled fun.

I guess the story was fairly perfunctory: the two sisters and their ancestors have always struggled to overcome the curse of their 'practical magic': the premature deaths of their lovers.

39,SKG-2,Send this to the grave,1,17 March 1999,"Most of the bad adaptations this decade have been thrillers(like THE JUROR), but there have been others to creep through, like STRIPTEASE, a very funny novel made into a painfully unfunny movie, and this one.  I wasn't expecting to like the Alice Hoffman novel this movie is based on, but it's a wonderful work which lives up to its title; it's about magic, but less about the ""bubble, bubble, toil and trouble kind""(though there is some of that) than the magic that is in everyday life, and everything is grounded in some kind of reality.  And all four main characters(Sally, her sister Gillian, and her two daughters Kylie and Antonia) are well drawn and ones you care about.The movie, on the other hand, is awful.  All the delicacy, subtlety, nuance, and especially the human quality are thrown right out the window.  Instead, director Griffin Dunne and writers Adam Brooks, Akiva Goldsman, and Robin Swicord(though Goldsman has by far the worst track record, so I'd like to believe he's the most responsible) substitute your standard witches story, and while they keep some of the plot of the novel, it makes no sense when thrown in with this rubbish.  The look of the film is all wrong; we even look like we're in a cheap horror movie.  You don't get much sense of the characters, or of them being capable of anything(in the novel, after her husband dies, and after she spends a year being miserable, Sally leaves; here, she just stays, why?  Cause it's the Idiot Plot).  And while Bullock and Kidman deserve credit for trying to mine something out of this(Bullock is the most successful here), Dianne Wiest is lost, Stockard Channing is uncharacteristically awful(she must have had some reason to channel Bette Davis, but damned if I know it), and Aidan Quinn looks like he'd rather be somewhere else(who could blame him?).

This picture is about women for women and mostly made by women.Everything has a soft feminine touch to it, even the violence and the action. In this piece, witchcraft simply represent women power. The scenario is built around what it means to be a strong woman, how it can set you apart, and the danger associated with this strength.It has sweet moments, some tearful moments, some funny moments, and a certain dose of intrigue to pique our interest. Now, you can't jump into this movie and expect a big bang, like what you usually get out of most Hollywood movies.

It is a bit Hollywood and predictable but that is part of the charm as of course you want a happy ending.Essentially about a family of females who are witches, and generally hated by their community. They've never had luck with love and generations of women have ended up alone until fate deals them a hand that allows them to love and be part of the community.

44,mnpollio,Great story suffers from Hollywood chick-flick syndrome,5,2 May 2011,"Alice Hoffman's Practical Magic is an eccentric little novel centering on the misadventures of two sisters with a talent for benevolent witchcraft. It would truly make a great movie...this is not it.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are cast as Sally and Gillian Owens, two polar opposite sisters who hail from a bizarre family where the females are noted for their mastery of hocus pocus and their bad luck with men. Naturally, the community scorns them and their borderline batty aunts, played by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing, which causes the sisters to strike out on their own with varying degrees of success. The cautious Bullock happily marries, but finds hubby number one stricken by the family curse of early demise. The free-spirited Kidman gets saddled with abusive whack-job Goran Visjnic. When the sisters finally come together, Bullock's efforts to rescue Kidman go awry with a supernatural bent.Where Hoffman's novel was whimsical, the tone of the film is sledgehammer with flourishes of TV sitcom. The screenplay does not seem to want to take the time to set up the sister's travails and their successes in life and wants to rush everything to its own disadvantage. Whimsy is a hard quality to capture and maintain on film, but the fact that Practical Magic does not even try and pitches everything to the lowest common denominator says it all. Instead of amusing, insightful and deliciously off-kilter characters and situations, we get a truck-load of overly familiar chick-flick nonsense - including the by now too familiar and embarrassing women lip-synching and dancing around the kitchen routine.The latter third of the film gets bogged down in a completely wrong-headed subplot which finds Kidman possessed by the evil spirit of Visjnic and requiring the assistance of the aforementioned nasty townswomen to perform an exorcism. It is a development that never appeared in the novel and it comes out of left field in the film. One can only imagine the writers gabbing amongst themselves about what a great twist this would be. Unfortunately, we never believe that Kidman is truly in any danger, the townswomen far too easily throw aside their differences with the witches and start spouting nauseatingly precious bilge about sisterhood, and the whole thing degenerates into equal parts misfired special effects show and cheesy female empowerment monologues.The only thing that prevents the film from becoming a total loss are the lead actresses. Bullock is vulnerable and winning as the level-headed sister. Kidman is sexy and funny as the wilder sister not afraid to shake things up. Unfortunately, a prime plot from the novel that gave Kidman a genuine romance that would have really showcased her range has been omitted to favor the foolish exorcism plot here. Both actresses are so far better than the material that they are handed that it seems a real tragedy that they have not yet been given an opportunity to play opposite each other in better material. Wiest and Channing take the stock roles of the batty old aunts and ground them enough to make the clichés seem more charming than they have any right to be. The men have it rougher. Visjnic is sexy, but not especially menacing as the bad-guy plaguing Kidman. Aidan Quinn shows up late in the film as a police officer and new love interest for Bullock. He looks bored and so will you be. Mark Feuerstein has some nice early moments as Bullock's first husband, but the film does not have much use for him.Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the leads, this ranks as another example of a promising novel robbed of any originality or insight on its way to the screen. If the screenplay had not stooped to so many of the tiresome chick flick clichés and had trusted its target audience to embrace something a bit different, it would only have been for the better. Instead, we have a whole lot of something that might have been, but sadly isn't.",Practical Magic

Although Practical Magic does not have all the creative ingredients of  ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which was very creative, the movie brings in its own magic. Cute! I believe that kids would like this movie more than adults, because kids love to get spooked and the movie is less predictable to them. I like Sandra Bullock and try to watch her movies despise the critics, or the average star rating from any magazine. I like to come up with my own opinion about things in general. In many instances a movie that is neither big box office nor a big Oscar winner is more fun to watch several times than the three and a half hour of serious acting Oscar winners. It all depends what we are in the mood for. I enjoyed these movies especially when the special effects started. Favorite Scenes: Those moments of love between the two sisters.

Because I know several pagans, I can say that the magick aspect of it was fairly accurate (more accurate than most of the ""witch movies"" out there now, and, as a ghost hunter, the banishing was really well done.)Having said all that, I still can't pinpoint what I really didn't like about it. It's like the movie couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama; a modern fairy tale or a true to life tale.The end came too quick and the answer to the problem seemed too pat and too easy.

50,cosmorados,What are you talking about?!,3,3 July 2008,"This is one of the most bizarre mish-mashes of a film that I have ever seen. It wanders from being a girl-bonding film to a romance to witchcraft with each segment popping up like one is reading a magazine with one part following another with no real cohesion between them. The basic idea is that Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman play witches, and Sandra can't have a normal romance with a human because she is a witch.We learn this early on and from this point on the film ambles through plot lines and ideas, each with about fifteen minutes till it moves onto the next idea which last for another 15 minutes. Each moment is so disconnected from the rest that you feel no real passion for the characters and no distinctive connection to the story, if you can call it that.If you're after a good chick flick with magic see ""Stardust"", if you want a good chick flick in general see ""Bring it on"", but for pity's sake please avoid this one.

I Rated this a 3 out of 10 because NICOLE KIDMAN IS HOT IN THIS FILM! I envy Tom cruise back then! Nicole was so Beautiful! Still is, but nicole kidman in the 1990's was IRRESISTIBLE! I rated this film a 3 because I have a crush on younger nicole kidman AND the concept of Witches and family is Cool! Sadly, the reason why I couldn't forgive this film was because the Characters try to resurrect an abusive boyfriend, after he tried to choke nicole kidman to DEATH! They should've run the car over him, or just left him at the place he was peeing. But nope! They kill him and then put him in the car, then bring him to their home, ENDANGERING THE DAUGHTERS! Then, bring him back to life, where he tries AGAIN, to choke nicole/jilly bean to death! Then, they kill him, AGAIN! Also, i know it's ""chick flick"" but All these Unnecessary girly pop songs ruin the movie. Faith hill's ""this kiss?!"" Ugh. I'm a dude, watching this film because i've never seen it, but wanted to see nicole, as i have a crush on her. Did Nicole Mary Kidman put a spell on me?! Anyway, the film fails because of the cheesy pop songs and the resurrection of the killer boyfriend. I'm surprised more reviews aren't asking why they even cared about the killer boyfriend, after he beat the lady and tried to kill her. Maybe i just Really love Younger Nicole Kidman(She put a spell on Me) and dont want to see anything bad happen to Her. I like Nicole kidman as Samantha in Bewitched. But her character in this is just dumb. Why do some girls date the worst dudes? I wanted to like this movie, but am not surprised it grossed less than $80million worldwide.",Practical Magic
54,robert-259-28954,I really enjoyed this film.,8,8 January 2014,"As much as I hate to admit it, I really liked this film. A little on the subject matter, first. It was all pure hooey. That said, there were a few accuracies woven in their somewhere on the subject of Wicca, but alas, Hollywood seems stuck in the dark ages concerning the ancient philosophy. So it didn't dispel any of the time honored myths, it just riffed on them, but to often hilarious and often entertaining ways. Best of all, it made fun of witchcraft, rather than burned women at the stake for it, which it worked particularly well— not demonizing something is always a good thing. But especially surprising was the passionate tryst between Bullock and Quinn, which was so hot that it practically peeled the paint off my walls. Who knew that Plain Jane Bullock could actually conjure up some sexual magic of her own on screen? All in all, great fun and well told, all done tongue in cheek. Just go for the pure, dumb fun of it and you may just fall under its spell.",Practical Magic
55,samhill5215,Island women,8,25 February 2020,"This was a movie about women, entirely. The men existed to provide color and interest but only insofar as they revolved around the women. The foremost women were of course the Owens ladies but even the other women on the island dominated over the men. In fact most of the men had no part to play at all. The only men to have any part in advancing the plot were the four men connected in various degrees to the Owens women. In a sense the film celebrates the magic women exert on men only here it's real magic. As for the technical aspects lighting, direction, dialog, everything was very well done. The only negative was mumbling elsewhere mentioned. The leads were all a joy to watch and I particularly enjoyed seeing the progression of the two emerging talents, Camilla Belle and Evan Rachel Wood, to the seasoned actors of today.",Practical Magic

The director got material from 3 writers and totally failed to put it into any coherent form.
It's as if several films have been badly edited together. Some scenes seem unfinished and some should have been cut as they are pointless. The music was good but badly used. I am amazed that Griffin Dunne got any further directing work after this mess.
I'm sure the actors are horrified to be associated with it though I suppose it's a tribute to their professionalism that they turned in good performances in spite of the director.

57,great_sphinx_42,Charmless: A Tale of Two Witches,4,21 August 2001,"The single most striking thing about this relentlessly mediocre movie is the bizarre casting of the two lead roles. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman as sisters? What parallel universe does the casting person live in? Both actresses are lovely and talented, but each are the other's antithesis. Glamorous Nicole is all pale skin and red hair, so cool and immaculate and you think her skin would probably be icy to the touch- not that you would probably ever find out, so untouchable is she. By comparison, dark, earthy Sandy defies the practice of calling movie stars 'glamorous'- she possesses beauty and sex appeal, but she also exudes tremendous warmth and accessability. The implausability of these two sharing blood would be easier to ignore in the movie if these cool/warm, pale/dark qualities weren't so dominant in them. As it is, I found the contrasts to be the most interesting aspect. Anyway, Sandy and Nicole are Sally and Gillian, the latest pair of sister witches in an all-female family doomed to have the men they love die. Trying to safeguard against this, Sally is determined to never fall in love. As a precaution, she casts a spell specifying that she will only love a man with a certain combination of odd traits. Nonetheless, she does fall in love- with a man her meddling aunts bring into her life. She bears him two daughters, but- alas- the curse is a real one, and he dies. Gillian, meanwhile, is the wild one and is off living the high life with her 'Transylvanian cowboy' boyfriend. When he turns abusive, she calls on Sally. Sally is already suffering a haunting- she is so distraught over her husband's death that she has forbidden her aunts to teach her daughters magic and refuses to do so herself, though she is far more gifted a witch than Gillian. The killing, resurrection, and re-killing of the girlfriend-beater obliges them to endure a more literal haunting and the arrival of a cop (Aidan Quinn) who possesses a certain combination of odd traits. Added onto this is the suspicions of the town and the determined interference of the aunts and daughters. All of this actually sounds better than it is. The story is played out in such an insipid manner, it inspires scoffing and eye-rolling in equal (and large) amounts. The worst part of the whole affair is the climax, which is never a good thing, but should not be construed to indicate that much of anything preceding it was much good anyway.",Practical Magic
58,Willow192,Practically horrible,3,12 March 2001,"*WARNING:  THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS*I actually thought this movie would be pretty good when I first saw the previews for it.  You know...it looked like a nice, enjoyable, family fun filled film.  I can honestly say that I was completely blown away by how bad this movie was.  I HATE all Nicole Kidman movies, but I liked a few of Sandra Bullock's films (now that I think about it I really don't...).  But it also had Diane Wiest and Stokard Channing, which I usually like.  This movie was supposed to be supporting the craft but instead was filled with an innumerable amount of cliches (e.g., the brooms, telekinesis, black clothing, long, pointy hats, black cats, etc., etc., etc.). e Most of the movie made no sense either.  Why was that stupid Tigers Eye so important to Gillian?  If Sally never wanted to be in love, why would she wish for all of those stupid things that she wished for?  Like a man that has a star and can flip pancakes?  Can you say cheesy?  If the aunts knew that was a curse, why would they make her fall in love with a man that she didn't even know and have to kids?  Why would they try to bring Jimmy back to life, only to kill him again?  Why couldn't Gillian just hop on a bus and go back home after she had drugged Jimmy? And then there is the whole margarita scene which was just horrendous.  How are the two aunts gonna be practically drop-dead drunk, and then as soon as Gillian smashed the wine bottle they became sober and completely serious?  They should have tied them leaving into something else.  And then when Gillian is getting exorcised, she comes back to normal because they do the blood sisters thing and hug? No....Now lets talk about how atrocious that acting in the movie was.  Let's start with Jimmy (Goran Visnjic).  I might have possibly gotten the worst role in the movie.  So he dies so he turns into a ghost that can posses people. Then there.  The characters that were REALLY bad in this movie were Sally's daughters, Kylie and Antonia Owens (Evan Rachel Wood, and Alexandra Artrip). They were just too happy about every single thing that they did (e.g., when they were pouring out the ""bad"" syrup into the ocean).  And in the scene where they were crying, it sounded like they were laughing/choking on something.  I know that Evan Rachel Wood can do better than this, because she was great on 'Digging to China.'  I have never seen the other girl on anything...and after being in this movie, she will probably never get another role.  She was cute though...The love connection between Bullock and Quinn must have been strictly positional because there was no chemistry that would lead them to almost having sex in the movie...unless Quinn just thought Bullock was THAT good looking.  They barely spoke, and then they get married.  And of course that lifts the spell that couldn't be lifted in thousands of years.  The movie is just one corn fest.  Don't even waste 100 minutes of your valuable time watching this.  Because you will regret it.",Practical Magic
59,Ysman,Why was this movie more than 20 minutes long?,1,24 May 1999,"I never thought I would be dumbfounded by a Sandra Bullock movie, but I just sat staring at my TV screen after this movie was over wondering what in the hell just happened to me.  This movie was truly awful in every conceivable way.  The first hour of the movie was not necessary at all.  It had absolutely nothing to do with the final half.  Why was Adian Quinn in the previews, he had such an invisible role?  Are we to believe that all of the town people were scared and angry at the witches just because they had never been invited over for demon killin'?  Why was that margarita scene filmed? Why? Why? Why?  I haven't been this horribly amazed that a movie actually made it to the screen since Hush.  Griffin Dunne has done good work in the past?!

60,Rozinda,A very enjoyable and at times thought-provoking movie,10,4 November 2009,"There are spoilers ...I just can't understand why many people didn't like this movie. It's brilliant. I haven't read the book. Perhaps that's a reason - is the movie markedly different? Well, I'll be reading the book soon.There's amazing chemistry between the four female stars and particularly between Bullock and Kidman. The premise for the story, well I don't know if that's very original or has been done many times before as I don't usually read books on this sort of theme, ie magic, and at the start of the movie I wondered if I'd like it. Was it going to be a tragedy? When Sally's husband is killed off and Sally is deeply depressed for so long after , I was upset, thinking oh dear this is going to be miserable, am I sure I want to watch any more of this and end up feeling utterly dismal at the end of it. I really don't like unhappy endings. Fortunately I carried on watching because I admire Bullock's work and wanted to see what she made of this story, and Kidman and the aunties were so intriguing. The story becomes wild as Gilly finds herself unable to control her sexy but nasty lover and what happens to him turns this for a while into a sobering sequence of violence towards a woman, but then a truly hilarious and inspired zombie movie, especially when nice, normal cop Gary finds himself confronted with and having to believe in what he can't believe in - that zombie! The witches' finale is perfect. The Happy Ending is all there. My one sadness is that Sally's first husband and father of her two children was killed off yet the implication seems to be her witchy aunties caused her to fall in love with the guy just to make her happy because she didn't want to be a witch - so was it ever really love and happiness or just a dream? Seems to me, since they knew it'd end in misery because of the curse, they'd have done better not to interfere - but then, would she have ever met Gary and would the curse have been lifted? I suppose it all had to happen as it did.Gary the kind-hearted cop who ends up with Sally, and the youngsters who play Gilly's children are excellent as well. To bring critical ladies of the town into the Magic House to help Sally and Gilly is the obvious answer to get them to understand how being different isn't a sin nor to be despised - on the level of being different resulting in being bullied, this is a splendid movie to show how anyone who's different but not wicked suffers needless cruelty sometimes just through not conforming with the crowd. Fortunately this isn't dwelt on too much, and the witches are mostly strong characters, but still the point is made.I liked the little touches from the town ladies such as ""I always wanted to see inside your house"" which shows how most of those who aren't different would be kind if they weren't afraid of appearing different by association.Don't be put off, it isn't sermonising, it's just what you'll notice as it goes along about misconceptions leading to misery for the victims.On the DVD I enjoyed the extras except I had a big problem with the commentary. The movie was showing in the background, but for so long as I could bear to listen, the commentary was nearly all the time the director and he talked on and on about how he'd planned and made the movie etc but what he was saying bore no direct relationship to the movie scenes in the background. This was infuriating as I'd expected him and the other commentators and especially Sandra Bullock to talk about the specific scenes as they came along. Not far into the commentary, the director starts talking about how he conceived the zombie sequence, but that comes near the end of the movie. It was totally cart before the horse stuff! I concluded this commentary was made divorced from the scenes on screen and since I was already tired of the director's near-monologue and had hardly heard anything from Sandra Bullock, I switched off the commentary.",Practical Magic
61,mbworm,Sandra and Nicole are a whimsical match,7,17 January 2008,"Although it's quite simple in its approach and it doesn't really contain much depth, ""Practical Magic"" is entertaining as a lighthearted fantasy-comedy.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are Sally and Gillian Owens, two beautiful orphan sisters who were raised by their eccentric aunts, who happen to practice witchcraft.Now all grown up, the sisters finally part ways and the audience gets a glimpse at both of their interesting lives. One runs away to find adventure and one falls hopelessly in love. Everything seems perfect until a dark series of events brings the Owens sisters back together...When a malevolent force threatens to kill Gillian and begins terrorizing Sally and her children, the sisters have to dig up their magical backgrounds and dabble with dangerous spells and curses.The movie is never too serious and Sandra and Nicole shine in their roles, each giving a touching and comedic performance.

I can't bear to imagine what other movies these people have watched lol. It's based on a book I haven't read, and probably won't read either. It's labelled as a rom com, but it's not a comedy and the romance doesn't really come off very convincing due to no chemistry at all between Bullock and Quinn. So horror flick maybe ? No luck there either. It's simply too dull to be creepy. So we're left with drama and that doesn't work either since the script seems to be going everywhere and nowhere at the same time. The cast is great though except for the fact that the script leaves very little for the actors to work with. Bullock plays Bullock, Channing does a good job as one of the aunts, and Kidman and Wiest are just wasting their time mostly. I guess the people who made it had a feeling that this sucked, and decided to throw in some good names to draw an audience, but they might as well have decided to bury it instead of wasting all that talent.

83,MeMyselfOnline,"It may lack depth, but it's still charming.",8,9 May 2002,"Looking through many movie reviews on IMDB it occurred to me how often a film can be marked down if a reviewer feels it didn't portray the novel as well as they feel it should have.  For me though, I think that reading a book and watching a film will always be two very different medias.  When you read, you are lost in the world your mind creates.  When you view, it is a much more linear affair with much less room for self interpretation.So... having come to this film having never read the book I fail to see the holes that others may think it has.  To me, the film is simply a good film and one that I have returned to more than once.  You all know the ones, we all have them in our collections.  There are certain films that you always associate with a certain feeling.  Then you'll be sat at home and something will trigger a memory and you'll think ""I know, I'll watch (insert film here)"".  Well, Practical Magic is one of those films.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, but as a result you never feel you have to question it's motives. It doesn't try to be something it's not.  It's more a film about the relationship of two sisters than a tale of two witches.  The magic aspect is secondary which helps to tie in with the whole point of the movie, that magic can be practical and doesn't necessarily have to be fantastic.I think the movie does a good job of conveying this and shouldn't be knocked too badly just because it doesn't create the same images as the book may have done for you.  Every person who reads a book will have a different idea of how the characters look and the world they inhabit.  It's impossible for a film to match everyones ideals.Just watch the film for what it is and you wont be disappointed.",Practical Magic
84,cdimdb,Just don't inhale,2,13 June 2006,"Well, I suppose we deserve this sort of thing, given all the male wish-fulfilment fantasy films going around - plot: unlikely guy scores (i.e. sex) with fahbulous fox, via a series of unlikely events. It's only fair to have a few similarly implausible numbers where women (albeit fahbulously foxy ones) score (i.e. marriage) with dreamy, strong-but-sensitive, protective guys with whom they can Live Happily Ever After. And even the dangerous bad man is Goran Visnjic, whose only flaw is that he wants desperately to marry Kidman's character - with menaces if necessary. Fair enough. The male equivalents focus on equally infeasible breasts, after all.There are aspects that do make one think, though. I really don't believe this witch thing, for example, is healthy. A number of shows are currently pushing this particular fantasy. Perhaps it's no more dangerous than the male one in which Our Man routinely dodges surface-to-air missiles, but it seems that some gullible people really believe this stuff, and think they actually have magical abilities. Witch Power is the new Women's Intuition.(I note with alarm another review here which speaks darkly about Belladonna's supposed 'dark' powers: lady, Belladonna is just atropine, a stimulant. It's just a chemical, like adrenalin, and nothing magical. Like most 'medicinal' plants, Deadly Nightshade is just trying to discourage animals from eating it, by dosing them with a substance that, inter alia, wrecks appetite.) I digress. In sum, this is not a very good film, but it's just wish fulfilment for those of a female persuasion and a certain age. Male viewers will probably have to derive what enjoyment they can from observing some very pretty and/or very talented actors, though in a far from ideal vehicle.",Practical Magic
85,presence,Decent but boring,7,11 November 1998,"Practical Magic is the type of movie that would be categorized as a ""chick flick"".  While the ""chick flick"" genre can't be specifically defined, it is open for anybody to watch.  There are some parts of this movie I liked, and many parts I disliked. For example, I really liked the scene where Gillian and Sally tried to bring Gillian's boyfriend back to life.  It was very funny and creepy.  But the final scene where they tried to exercise the spirit out of Gillian, was probably unnecessary.  The movie moves at a vary slow pace, but the plot is decent and not too complex.  It's worth a look if you're Sandra Bullock or Nicole Kidman fans.",Practical Magic

Stockard Channing is actually really funny in this film but she doesn't play a big enough role to raise this film rating. I would urge everyone to not buy this film as it is utter garbage and a complete waste of money to buy it on DVD.

90,Starcat Zeppo,In favor of this movie!,10,11 September 1999,"Reading the reviews of this movie is like being on a teeter-totter. One hates, the other loves, one hates... I LOVED THIS MOVIE.Maybe it's because I come from a family of 6 sisters.... The bonding and care between the sisters and the Aunts, standing against the rest of the town's distrust and dislike shows family strength.  When Sandra is weeping over her husband dying, I cried with her. I thought it was a fabulous moment for her in the movie.If you want a movie about a woman getting revenge on an abusive husband, rent The Color Purple (ALSO a fave of mine)  This movie was playful, at times slightly spooky... Hello? It's a Witch story... it should have SOME spooky stuff in it, and I don't feel the special effects were too over done.As far as them inviting the women of the town in to help, I loved that whole sceen as well. The flash backs to the sisters as children and not wanting to let the other go... all of it. Each time that sceen pops into power mode, it makes me want to call every one of my sisters.  I haven't read the book, so I understand there might be some disappointment from those who HAVE read it. Movies rarely pack the punch of the written word they're based on. (Like EVERY King movie EVER put on film!)But I adore Practical Magic.  I saw it in the theater, and bought it as soon as I could.",Practical Magic
91,lllama,Loved it,9,2 May 2002,"Normally I don't care for chick flicks, but I can't seem to stop watching this one over and over again.  I was surprised that so many others didn't care for it.  I just loved the sets, the costumes, the women and their relationships, the real magic in the film, the special effects, the child actresses.  This was stuff that women could relate to better than men. Aidan Quinn was the only boring part of the movie.  I wished they'd chosen an actor who was more into the role.  He seemed bored and made his part in the film more boring.  (Also, he mumbles.  Someone should give him elocution lessons.)This movie wasn't meant to be heavy.  It was meant to be light, fun fluff, and that it is.  The characters weren't meant to be deep, but I felt the relationship between the two sisters was deeper and well performed by two skilled actresses.  In spite of the fluffiness of it, I enjoyed the two scenes in which we got to sit and relax to the sound of Stevie Nicks' ""Crystal.""  So what if cars weren't crashing and guns weren't shooting. They weren't supposed to be.  I felt the camaraderie of the moment as the two sisters and their aunts got drunk on ""midnight margaritas"" while dancing to Harry Nilsson's ""Lime in the Coconut.""  It was just plain light fun. Also, women can enjoy the vicarious satisfaction of watching these women destroy the evil, bullying man who tries to destroy them. 
The end of the film was rather Disney-kiddie-flick-like.  Another ending might have worked better, but it was tolerable because it reminded the audience that the film was all in fun, and not to be taken seriously.I usually prefer deeper films, but I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of fluff. Sure it was silly and campy, but it was fun.  A film doesn't have to take itself seriously to be fun.  Bullock, Kidman, Channing, and Wiest are beautiful, charming and wonderful to watch in this flick, and I love watching the four of them over and over again.",Practical Magic

A great movie to watch with the spouse, especially for the eye candy on both sides.",Practical Magic
98,myrddyn,"A fun movie, despite a few weak points",7,1 June 1999,"It appears that director Griffith Dunne tried to keep this film from being as powerful as it could have been.  The movie fails to fully develop the town's overt fear of witches (missing only slightly), the full foreboding of ""something wicked this way comes"" with Jimmy (although the script lets them get away with it), and the magical love bond between Sally and Gary.  A few small changes, such as more supportive background music, would have made these points support and counterpoint the lighter parts of the flick.Bullock and Kidman are very good as the central characters, very believable as different-but-bonded sisters.  Kidman is a little too flaky at times to be a fully credible witch, but this characterization runs well enough in context.  Channing (whom I rarely enjoy) and Wiest are excellent in major supporting roles, outdone only by Webb and Wood (Sally's daughters) who show their abilities by *not* overacting their potentially cutesy roles. Instead, they do a great job in stating variations on their mother and Aunt Gilly.Overall, I think most aspects of direction and production could have used one more iteration of quality improvement.

As long as she does her job very well, which you can see in this ""Practical Magic"", no more virtues are necessary. Thank God she's not some kind of ""personality"", sometimes all you want to see is someone who can play normal characters properly, even if it's a witch; because, beyond being a witch, Sally - Bullock's character - could be the girl next door.Nicole Kidman is Sally's sister Gillian, she has some magic skills too, but prefers to live like a tramp, while Sally tries to live as normally as she can. Their parents died when they were young because of a curse that lays over their family and so they are raised by two nice and gentle witch aunts (Diane Wiest and Stockard Channing, fabulous as always).

But after reading the source material, I now admire it for things I didn't even notice before.The relationship between the sisters (all three pairs), mothers and daughters, aunts and nieces, neighbours, enemies, lovers, abusers and the abused. Its a study of how these relationships can save you (even from yourself).It's also a look into who you are and how you fit in. If everyone thinks you are a witch, do you own it or fight it? Do you care?Will you allow the curses of your ancestors to wreck havoc on the descendants they never lived to meet?This movie brings up so many questions about the human spirit and how we work with or against one another.

Alright, it's not going to win any major awards, but for what it is it's OK. Firstly let me make it clear that as a general rule I am not a fan of romantic comedy, generally I find it insipid and it bores me to tears, however, I found this film quite enjoyable.  The fantasy and horror elements took the movie away from the routine rom-com mush and moved the movie nicely.  There were also some very touching scenes, the one with the sisters on the bed, with Sally crying for her(SPOILER)dead husband nearly set me off.  The two aunts added some great moments (I've always been a Stockard Channing fan), and the two daughters were great.  Obviously Sandra Bullock & Nicole Kidman were looking damn hot which helped this movie from a male perspective. Overall this film is light fare, fairly entertaining and rarely drags.

If sexy legs and cleavage and up-all-night sisterly cuddles are your idea of good-natured fun (not without a bit of funky twist of the supernatural), then this movie will do you justice. Mmm.Personally, I've never felt such intensely contradicting emotions during the course of one movie. Most of the times I'm grimacing for better plot development. That is, can the story dump the cliches with more confidence and truly explore real-life issues of women such as abuse --- instead of using it as a stepping-stone for sexy actresses to get wicked and 'bewitched'?!) The stock characters of the female townies, always adversary to the sister-witches, are truly embarrassing.The film remains superficial precisely because it touches on, rather than develops, very complex phenomena like fear of witches (read: powerful women), competition among women, abusive relationships, women's cinderella dreams, fitting in, female ambitions (examplary housewife or wild slut - your pick), etc etc etc!!!! Instead these issues are *exploited* for a *greatly* uneven film: a hodge-podge of romance, black/family comedy-drama, suspense, crime story, science fiction...We CAN still have a fun and exciting movie with a story that focuses on, respects, and gives its all to one or two of these topics without using them for their surface/shock values (really!)It's highly possible that the film started out with a solid good script based on the book and gets tampered with by the studio for maximum appeal later on. The most horrifying aspects for me? The flying witches at the end (oh GAWD!) The strange cut from the sexual passions of the main romance to a weird-and-weak confrontation with the supernatural undead boyfriend (as if the effects people are itching to drop a load of Hollywood eye candy - even at expense of awkward development!) And the overall stereotypical typecasting of women.The only enjoyable elements left of the film are the two female leads. I have to admire their courage and creativity in some of the absolutely ludicrous moments (midnight magarita, flying as witches, one nibbling on the other's ear...) And that atmospheric opener with grandma-witch who got knocked up by an unfaithful member of the male species and is crying up a storm toward an open sea?....just fastforward to Nic and Sandra.

It shows the good and the bad sides of magic. Magic causes death but it also causes love. The cast is fantastic. It's probably the only movie I like of Nicole Kidman's career. Sandra Bullock is always amazing. Stockard Channing and Diane Keaton are my favorite. They have great chemistry with each other. I don't think the movie would be as good without them.

Knowing that no film can cover all the ground of a novel, it was nevertheless extremely disappointing to experience the departures the movie made from the book.  It was especially aggravating that the love interest for the Nicole Kidman character (not the zombie; it came after that part) was eliminated from the movie, and this was by far the more engaging of the romances in the novel.

Bullock and Kidman give relaxed, convincing performances, but I think the problem lies in the writing of the characters. I felt that they were strict character types, and totally lacked subtlety and nuance. The same could probably be said for the rest of the film actually. Everything was very black and white. Total evil or perfect love. Worst enemies or best friends. Complete confusion or utmost certainty. I felt that it was all very inhuman, and I was never fully sutured as a result. This film may have been full of magic, but a grounding in reality is important. Life just isn't that clear cut, and people who have been in bed for days never look that perfectly groomed.

The audience is captured and entertained by the performances of Sandra Bullock, and Diane Wiest.  Stockard Channing and Nicole Kidman give good support, but their performances stop short of believable.  This is like a fairy tale with a dark twist, a Halloween story for adults, with just enough authentic details of witchcraft thrown in to keep it interesting.  Some special effects are surprising and enchanting, and different enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.

119,geralf,Good acting; good actors; poor script; good direction,4,14 August 2002,"I've just watched this film, PRACTICAL MAGIC. My perspective is the following: Having not read the book, but having read a number of 'user comments' who have, there's no doubt that the script veers considerably from the thrust of the book.  Perhaps this explains why there were considerable leaps from reality, hoping the viewer would not mind the 'jumps & jerks' from what was supposed to be a realistic 'peek' at the unique world of 'witches' even though they be of good heart and purpose.  Just look at the conclusion (one user/viewer said it was somewhat like Disney's approach) as an example. There no doubt is a 'dark' side to witchcraft, as well as a lighter side, both of which produce their own consequences, which it seemed this story line was trying to present. The romantic side for some reason, was unconvincing, which I'm not sure was Aidan Quinn's problem; this was likely caused by the script. Stories such as this fail to bring in other religious perspectives such as, IF THERE ARE WITCHES, ISN'T IT LIKELY THAT THERE IS GOD AS WELL, supposed to be the ultimate supreme power and being? Wether you are Jewish, Christian, Muslim or any other who believes in an ultimately supreme being, dealing with any form of supernatural power without including 'the supreme being' in the formula of the story, really is quite without credibility.  I gave it a 4.",Practical Magic
120,rabbit_caviare,"Not bad, see it sometime",8,28 June 2005,"I really liked this movie.The sets were pretty, the acting was great, and the casting choices were definitely well done. It surprises me that so many people here didn't like this flick, I found it very enjoyable.The only complaint I really have is this: it's a bit slow paced. Practical Magic is one of those movies that has more talk than action, with less smoke and mirrors than one may expect in a movie about magic. However, if you enjoy a good love story with actual substance, I recommend you see it. If intense action scenes and gore are your cup of tea, this one's probably not for you.",Practical Magic
121,schroederana,It wouldn't be Halloween without it,10,29 June 2021,"I absolutely love this movie, I watch it every single Halloween and it never fails to disappoint. It tells a magical story about two witch sisters and their aunts navigating through loss and love. It also has a kind of dark and mysterious twist to it that makes it thoroughly entertaining. The cast is absolutely incredible, I mean, what else could you want in a film? I will never stop recommending it.",Practical Magic

123,Marie-13,What happened?,4,16 June 1999,I really was disappointed at this movie and I watched it twice and could not figure out if it was the writing that was bad or the actors.  Since I like most of the actors I went with writing.  I could not believe what I watched. It was boring and confusing as well as so Hollywood.  I did not have any emotions while watching this movie.  Though it was the two Aunts in the film that save me from throwing it in the trash.  Their lines were good and they were funny.,Practical Magic
124,goffin,HATED IT!,1,6 November 1998,"Not only was this movie not what it was advertised to be (too bad movie goers can't sue for false advertising) but it was the worst movie I've seen in a long time...a total waste of money.  The editing was terrible, the story was chaotic and uneven, the romance had zero chemistry (I couldn't believe the characters even LIKED each other...let alone loved each other), the witchcraft was stupid and disgusting (I almost walked out after the bird scene)...and worst of all it was boring. Was there a writer? It looked like it was  pasted together with no forethought or planning. It makes Dumb and Dumber look like a work of art! What a mess!",Practical Magic
125,laloca,"Overall, I liked it",6,21 October 1998,"A cute film with some odd turns (everything shifts to an homage to the exorcist for a bit).  Stockard Channing is wonderful as one of two spinster aunts (Diane Wiest plays the other, more sober one); Sandra Bullock doesn't seem that different from anything else she's done -- brain candy.  Nicole Kidman (whom I generally dislike) isn't offensive, although her character is only half-drawn.Aidan Quinn seems to have put on some poundage, but gives a reliable performance as an investigator/love interest.There's also Chloe Webb in a small part -- a nice treat for fans of the actress.",Practical Magic
126,Sloe,Steel Magnolias meets Witches of Eastwick,7,17 November 1998,"If you go in expecting only to be entertained, you won't be disappointed. The soundtrack will be a hit whether the movie is or not......The best scene.....OoOoolalaa Midnight Margaritas!Sandra Bullock pulls off the shy, intellectual, dependable Sally - but then she should....she's played it over and over - in Speed, The Net, While You Were Sleeping, etc  Nicole Kidman is incredibly sexy as the spacy rebel sensualist.  And the aunts!  *laugh*  I nearly died when I saw them. Reminded me of an old eccentric aunt I grew up with.The weakest parts were the male characters.   Sally's husband was non-existent  (did he even have a name??)  Then the cop & the bad guy - neither were believable in their roles - perhaps it would have been better to omit them, and just let it be a light funny chick flick.This would be a great video to rent for a slumber party or GNO (Girl's Night Out) and pretty soon everyone will be singing ""Put the lime in the coconut"".......",Practical Magic
127,hannahcurwen_arsenal,A classic enjoyable one for me!,9,3 March 2021,"I have loved this movie since I was a kid, me and my sister still watch it together and quote it. It's funny, tragic, powerful and a little dark and I think if you're looking for something to watch as a family that you can still enjoy to adulthood this is perfect.Kidman and Bullock are both fantastic and have a good chemistry as the leads (despite looking nothing like sisters) and Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest offer great comedic support as their aunts!If you haven't watched it I definitely recommend!",Practical Magic
128,tab-9,An Enchanting Movie About Romantic Witchcraft,9,17 October 1998,"""Practical Magic"" is among the best movies to come out this year.  It's a grown version of the best of ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Ally McBeal"" with magic.  This movie's fun humor and serious drama make for a wonderful emotional roller-coaster ride with some frightful moments and some hilarious moments and some poignant moments.  This movie is more about all manner of human relationships with witchcraft as a background setting and it succeeds in a spell-binding fashion with a great soundtrack that fits perfectly into the movie.  Unlike all the critics who said this movie couldn't find its center, this movie hexes those critics and displays its own enriching manner of plot and movie direction under Griffen Dunne.  It has its own charm that sets is own agenda instead of catering to critics' love for simple movie genres.",Practical Magic
129,natwinks,"cute, funny, and scary in that ""witchy"" kinda way",10,14 November 1998,"OK, it's really not scary at all, but I thought Practical Magic was an EXCELLENT movie. Sandra Bullock is cute as always, and Nicole Kidman is the seductive wild child. As sisters, Kidman is the gas and Bullock is the brakes in this film. Tie in a dead boyfriend, a family curse, and a cute cop and you have yourselves a little kunundrum for a family of witches in the small town in which they live.",Practical Magic
130,kiss_me_angel2003,I love this movie!,9,28 January 2005,"It's not so far-fetched if you know what I mean. There's no 'Abra cadabra!'. It's a story about modern witches who can stir coffee with their minds and make evil syrup...Hehehe.There's a curse on the family, that any man the Owens woman loves is doomed to die, so told by the Aunts (One of them is Stockard Channing). The two main characters (Sally and Gillian 'Jilly' 'Jilly Bean' Owens)grow up as two miserable little girls because they are outcasts as everyone knows they're different. Jilly and Sally go their separate ways and Sally falls forcefully in love with a man who dies because she loves him. Her little girls (Black and red haired) live with her. Jilly goes through MANY men and finally, she ends up with Jimmy. I'll leave it at that so that you HAVE to rent this movie to get the full picture. It's very enticing!There are a few gaps that could be awesomely filled in. Like the few minutes before the Halloween tradition takes place...*sigh*I love the effects of the magic, and I enjoy the scene of Jilly in her car, 'witching' herself to Sally in one night, but it looks like a few.You'll really love this movie!",Practical Magic
131,liv-4,"A very unique film, full of magical surprises...",10,21 October 1998,"A couple of months before Practical Magic came out in theaters, I read the novel it was based on by Alice Hoffman, and loved it. So when I went to see 'Practical Magic' the movie, I didn't know what to expect, since most movie adaptions from books are very different and disappointing. But, while this was very different from the novel, I was pleasantly surprised. 'Practical Magic' is not your average romantic comedy or your average witch movie. Instead, it mixes the 2 genres together and creates a sparkling film that never gets boring. Even though some scenes are a little far-fetched, the acting, relationships and storyline keep it from getting too weird.As for the cast, I don't think it gets much better. Sandra Bullock pretty much plays her usual character, but she plays it with a well-acted sensitivity and you definitely sypathize for her. Nicole Kidman, is brilliant--very wild-child, but not so trampy that you hate her--and probably the most interesting character ( and the best performance) in the whole movie. Dianne Weist and Stockard Channing are extremely well cast as the eccentric aunts, and their on-screen presence is breathtaking. Aidan Quinn is also very good, playing Sandra Bullock's 'perfect man'. So what's my final outlook on 'Practical Magic'? Excellent. Sure, it's not a flawless, Oscar-worthy, masterpiece, but it's fun and one of the most interesting films I have seen in a long time. So, if you're looking for a well-acted, well-written, unique film, I definitely recommend 'Practical Magic'. And don't forget to read the book!",Practical Magic
132,Eric456,The Witches of Eastwick with a twist of lemon . . . .,10,19 March 1999,"I liked Practical Magic a lot. I didn't think I would because it was about two sisters and seems to be a ""chick flick"". However, there was a lot more to the movie than the relationship between Gillian and Sally Owens. For example, Gillian is possessed by the soul of her cruel mate after Sally accidentally kills him with too much magic. Also, the Owens curse plays a pivotal role in the movie. I was surprised by the movie and I know it should have made a lot more money, but the timing of the release was probably wrong. Good actors, and good direction. I bet the book is good too.",Practical Magic
133,sunwolf-2,Charming...,10,24 July 1999,"Unlike my predecessors, I enjoyed this movie immensely.  I have not read the book, perhaps this is why.  I loved the little anecdotes and jokes that came along the whole length of the film, keeping it interesting.  Granted, the story isn't the deepest in the world, and the special effects are just adequate, I think that in this day and age of 'Blockbuster' and 'Impact' and 'High Concept' films, this one is a little, charming gem that just warms the heart.  Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are great as the main characters and the 'aunts' and little girls are awesome as well.  I would (and am) recommend this movie to all my friends and you, too.  All in all, just charming...",Practical Magic

The movie has an awful script, and is often hard to follow. It's filled with plot elements that go nowhere, symbolism that doesn't make sense, and funny moments that aren't. And even though this is supposed to be a romantic comedy, there is a complete lack of chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Aidan Quinn. Top it off with an anti-climatic and unlikely ending (complete with cheesy, early-90's special effects), and you've got yourself a big waste of time and money. The big name stars completely failed to save this movie. Don't waste your time; do yourself a favor, head down to the library, and read the book instead.",Practical Magic

I think there was an obvious ""chemistry"" between Sandra Bullock & Nicole Kidman. They acted like sisters.But the best part of the movie was the music.  First time we saw it, we ran out and bought the soundtrack.   How many kids now a days have heard ""Put the Lime in the Coconut""The only real downside to the movie was towards the ending.

Without them, it probably wouldn't have been this good. Great teen movie with love, laugher, fiction, suspense, gorgeous people, and PERFECT acting. What more could you ask for? For those who didn't like this movie, go watch something political. The movie is fictional, not real! By the title any idiot can guess that.

Why the hell would you waste your time to watch the movie, much less comment on it?",Practical Magic
145,chrisgomez23,Decent!,4,2 April 2012,"Bullock and Kidman are very good as the central characters, very believable as different-but-bonded sisters. Kidman is a little too flaky at times to be a fully credible witch, but this characterization runs well enough in context. Channing (whom I rarely enjoy) and Wiest are excellent in major supporting roles, outdone only by Webb and Wood (Sally's daughters) who show their abilities by *not* overacting their potentially cutesy roles. Instead, they do a great job in stating variations on their mother and Aunt Gilly.Overall, I think most aspects of direction and production could have used one more iteration of quality improvement. Still, the movie is quite enjoyable, and worth watching again some time.",Practical Magic
146,WitchFire,Heartwarming and better than the Book.,9,5 February 2011,Saw the movie and loved it. It inspired me to read the book because books are usually better than the movie. Ha this time it was the other way around.The story was heartwarming about two sisters even losing touch with each other and reuniting when ones time of need touches a nerve with me or most likely anyone who has sisters. The acting from all the actors were done great. The female leads did a spectacular job.The backdrop and the special effects weren't tacky or distracting. Over all the plot was well done and you can feel the magical feeling which I felt was lacking in the book.Also... I LOVE that house.,Practical Magic

148,gfchav,Well done Halloween theme film,9,25 October 1998,"Sandra Bullock (Sally)is perfectly cast as the girl next door who just happens to be a witch. Her dark eyes and pure acting ability make her perfect for this role as the girl who likes everyone and does all she can for those she loves. Nicole Kidman (Gillian, Sally's sister) gave her best performance to date. She showed facial expression and a glare in her eyes in an amazingly wide range of emotion....from sultry to fearful to demonic and to pure loving. She won my admiration in this film as a great actress. Stockard Channing (Aunt Frances)dragged me right into the screen. I almost became her character. Her character is that of a loving aunt witch who teaches the greatest lesson by leaving the younger witches to fend for themselves.....only until her help is absoloutely required (the most challenging behavior for any parent). The sisters separate when Gillian runs off with an abusive man as Sally falls deeply for a local man and begins a fantastic family life having a wonderful husband and two daughters that resemble herself and her sister. There is trouble and this is where we begin to feel for the characters. Humor, family values, wild youth, abuse, love, hate, fear...it's all here in this great film. One fantastically fun scene occurs when the aunt witches appear to brew up some concoction for a spell when suddenly the nieces shout ""Margaritas.""

It is only in the latter types of moments that the movie is captivating and enjoyable, and its two co-stars are particularly enchanting. Sandra Bullock has never been more vibrant than in these scenes, and Nicole Kidman is radiant as always.The movie has other flaws as well. These include the selection of an annoying soundtrack that makes the depressing scenes even more so, and the director's penchant for close-ups in several instances when a slightly longer shot would have made the film much less jarring. My dissatisfaction stems largely from the fact that the trailers for this movie were so misleading, as they featured only the light-hearted fantasy/romance aspects of the story; had I known what this movie was really like, I probably would not have gone to see it.",Practical Magic

There was action, some romance, drama a bit of comedy and all without ""sacrificing"" Witchcraft.  The ""Witches"" were shown to be nice folks often misunderstood. The only thing I did not like was a ritual in which a bird was stuck with a pin.  As a Pagan I can say that we don't do that kind of thing.  Animals are often considered sacred and are friends.  Other than that,the movie presented Witchcraft in a fun light which I much appreciated.The characters showed some depth, but I got the feeling that there were some good scenes left on the cutting room floor to limit the time.

The solid performances from Bullock (predictable, but charming) and Kidman (not so predictable, and quite well played) kept the main core of the plot from unravelling, while the back-up support of the aunts (played brilliantly (IMHO) by Wiest and Channing) and the kids imbued a quirky humour that is this movie's main grace.I do have some gripes - I found the main romance to be somewhat unconvincing, but then, that could be just me :)  And the theory of much of the witchcraft seemed to be made up wholesale - surprise, surprise.  I sometimes wonder if Hollywood ever does its homework on these things.As I said, it's not Shakespeare.  But an overdose of the Bard can be too much of a good thing.

163,imaginatrix-1,"While I normally HATE chick flicks, I'm glad I watched Practical Magic",7,10 August 2007,"Practical magic is a girly movie, no way round that. Guys (in general) only like this movie because they want to please the girl they're watching it with, or because they get to look at Sandra or Nicole, or some combination of these things. But WHO CARES? Trish says DELIGHT in the chick-flickishness of this movie. It's such a great blend of comedy, drama and girly-girl sap that it's totally worth watching. Goran Visnjic is completely ab-fab-ly dreamy in this (the whole dark dangerous thing WORKS for him...works for me too, can you say amen!), Sandra Bullock is pretty much her usual bubbly vivacious self, and she even spared some charm for Nicole, who usually only grates like cheese. Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest wore their characters and their hair extensions well, the kids were great, even Aidan Quinn was charming. I guess I shouldn't say that like it's hard to believe...I've seen plenty of his movies that I liked, I was just always kind of surprised that I did.The plot of this movie is a new twist on basic themes that were done to death loooooooooooooooooooong ago, so it's refreshing to see that they got a bit of a zazzing-up. It's a nice contemporary spin on the concept of witchcraft, and the house is really great (too bad it's not a real house).The flick is fragmented enough that some stuff comes out of nowhere and isn't really even a part of the story, and in context with the movie I would have sincerely only believed that the ladies that worked in Sally's shop with her would be the only ones to show up when the phone tree was activated, and it wasn't explained away very well.And Sally wanting to explain to Gary what crime was committed and how, and he (the officer of the law) would rather get all mushy about her letter? Gag.BUT! When compared to some of those horrible, implausible movies that are supposed to be based on non-magical circumstances that you see on Lifetime and Hallmark Channel, Practical Magic is truly a diamond in the rough.

166,noralp,the best movie ever!!!,10,15 August 2002,"This is my favorite movie,it's the best movie i've ever seen, i love Nicole Kidman, in fact i think this is Nicole's best movie, it's really great, Nicole is my favorite actress and practical magic is my favorite movie, you should really own this movie. -nora",Practical Magic
167,azifucare,Excellent Movie,10,8 July 2004,"I enjoyed this movie very much and after watching it only twice, I went out and bought the DVD. Everything was top-notch and I have nothing bad to say.The acting was extravagant, the storyline was intriguing, and the quality of the film was awesome.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman gave wonderful performances that had me on the edge of my seat all the way to the very end. It was believable and made me want to view the movie all over again. Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest did extremely well as the aunts and they had me laughing like no other. Aidan Quinn and Goran Visnjic were unlike anything I've ever seen before and they portrayed their characters better than I could've imagined. Evan Rachel Wood and Alexandra Artrip were adorable as the little girls and made me feel like a young kid again. And the movie wouldn't be complete without the performances of the others cast in this wonderful film.Overall, I say this movie is definitely one of my faves and something I'll be watching for the rest of my life. I give this movie a 10 out of 10. I recommend that you go out and rent this movie. One of the best I've ever seen!!",Practical Magic
168,ghaidaa-kotb,love it !,10,23 November 2014,"This is so far My favorite movie of all time :) although its just 4 years older than me but the magic, the actresses, the story and everything makes me happy and enthusiast. I simply love it :) The magic in this story is so simple and UN-harmful its just pure and sweet. The acting of Sandra Bullock was amazing and the hair of Nickole Kidman was definitely the best in all of her movies (their clothes too) The story of Maria is good. The first time I saw this movie I was almost 14 and it got me :D ! Till now i f I'm really sad, I just try to search for this movie and Puff ! My mood is completely changed. So I recommend this movie along to potion of love or the ninth potion. I don't really remember Also the first movies of Sandra Bullock to those who want to change their mood :)",Practical Magic
169,cybercol,It's a great movie..I love it!,10,31 July 2005,"I love this movie! It's one of my favourite movies of all time! It is sad, but has comedy in it too. It is beautiful! I like that Nicole and Sandy are in the same movie, they're a great team. Also Goran as Jimmy and Gary are very good. The acting is good..the story is good, not too dramatic, not too light. It has a happy ending, which i like a lot.. It's a feel good movie. I can always watch it when i'm down, and i'm always a lot happier after it :d I'm a big Sandra Bullock fan and i think her acting in this film is again fabulous. Nicole Kidman is great too of course :D I really recommend this movie to anyone who likes a drama with a little humor.",Practical Magic
170,SweetLunacy,Great movie or what?,9,8 June 2005,"I absolutely love this movie! Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock did a wonderful job. Evan Rachel Wood (Kylie), also did an exceptionally good job, don't you think? I mean, she looks exactly like Nicole, so I think that Griffin Dunne was really talented in picking those two girls to play Sally's daughters. Although I love Sandra's character Sally, I feel that I relate more to Nicole's character Gillian. What about the rest of you? I have just seen another Nicole Kidman movie, so for those Nicole Kidman fans out there, if you haven't already, I strongly recommend watching the film Cold Mountain. That's all I have to say for now, but I will be posting comments on other movies as well as this one!",Practical Magic
171,witchy_poo,what about a sequel?,10,19 November 2006,"I read the book a few years after seeing this movie, and i HATE the book! It's dark, depressing, morbid! BORING! The movie on the other hand is witty, charming, and lovable! Seems the people who read the book first, love the book. Those who saw the movie first, love the movie! I've not found anyone who loves both.I saw this movie when it first came out! LOVED IT! But, the DVD and VHS versions are not complete. Too much has been taken out compared to what i saw at the theater! I should know... i saw it a total of 13 times at several different theaters! I'm still waiting for the full length version!!!!! I've asked politely, and still have not received it! How about a 10 year anniversary theatrical release special DVD!My thought is, see the movie... forget the book... and lets hope for a sequel! SANDRA, work your magic and make me another... please! And, when it comes out onto DVD (or whatever viewing medium is next), make it the theatrical version!",Practical Magic
172,frankieg-13438,"Entertaining & fun, yet complex & enchanting.",8,8 June 2019,"This movie is really what it's made out to be, and more. To me, it's not just a basic witch chick-flick, but a really entertaining story of modern-day, more relatable and 21st century, witchcraft.The story is complex, but not too complex to overwhelm the majority of an audience. It follows the story of a witch family and most prodominately that of two sisters, whom embark on a tale of love and romance and hold a battle against fate.Definitely family-friendly and would do either as a determined watch or a background flick, it's an amazing film in the sense that it can be enjoyed by all and would be suitable for every mood.",Practical Magic
173,dustinh456,Simply Magical!,8,9 August 2007,"I love just about all films and books related to magic, and this movie is not exception. What I loved most about this movie and the clear line between being witches and being women. Instead of a classic story of happy witches who use their magic with ease, this film focuses on how life would be today for witches and especially those trying to find love. This movie had some funny parts and is overall a good time. Of course, when watching this movie you have to remember not to take it too seriously. It's a drama, thriller, comedy rolled into one. The film dives deep into the the practice of Wicca and you have to be able to take it with a grain of salt and just have a good time with it, instead of referring it to as a film for devil worship.",Practical Magic
174,Gary-21,BEWITCHINGLY POWERFUL!,10,24 October 1998,"This movie was absolutely fantastic! Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest play their parts to perfection!  One look into Sandra's or Nicole's eyes, and you'll see why they fit the part of the Owens sisters.  There is power there, and it comes off in a beautiful display of fireworks!  Go see it! You'll go back to see it again.",Practical Magic
175,lunance,GO SEE MOVIE,8,20 October 1998,"I don't care what the critics said, this was a GOOD romantic comedy.  Its worth the full price and take your daughter, you will be able to talk about love,the meaning of love, family, prejudices, telling lies, and hope. It is a really entertaining flick.",Practical Magic
176,WILLY-13,"A very thrilling, mysterious, funny but yet uplifting magical love story all in one!",8,20 October 1998,"Practical Magic was so much better and entertaining than the previews let me believe.  Although, the movie is about witches, its very lively, funny, serious, but yet has a magical love story throughout the movie.  Overall, Practical Magic is uplifting and possesses a quality which is only obtainable from a cast which works well together.  The selection of music is equally meaningful and enhances the entertainment value of this well directed movie.",Practical Magic
177,sandy-39,Super! Nicole Kidman is hilarious!,8,15 October 1998,"Practical Magic is one of the most unusual chick-flicks I've seen in years. It deals more with the relationship between sisters Sally and Gillian (Bullock and Kidman) and how they deal with their magical powers than with the romance part of it.  Nicole Kidman is hysterical as the promiscuous, fun, yet not as magically gifted sister.  Sandra Bullock is wonderful as the serious sister not willing to use her magic and wanting to live a ""normal"" life.  Any fan of either Kidman or Bullock must see this movie.  They are both back in rare form!",Practical Magic
178,ironman-11,Why did they bother to make it??,4,17 October 1998,Acting was OK considering quality of stars but plot (if there was one) was very weak. After seeing it I wondered who would finance a script like this & expect to get a return.,Practical Magic
179,watson-4,It surprised me!!!,9,21 October 1998,"I read the book first and was expecting to be disappointed by the movie, but I wasn't. The movie strayed from the book but still managed to carry its own weight. I liked the twist of adding the possession into the story.",Practical Magic
180,WindSong,Haven't I seen this somewhere before?,4,21 October 1998,"This movie had so much potential, but never quite found its groove. Sandra Bullock character was one she plays well, but one we've seen from her often before, most recently in ""Hope Floats.""  Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the wild child sister bears a remarkable resemblance to Meg Ryan's portrayal of Pamela in ""The Doors.""",Practical Magic

182,TopCat-6,NOT What I Expected!!,3,1 November 1998,"The movie was not the romantic comedy that I expected (per the tv ads). In fact, when I did find something remotely funny, I laughed harder than I normally would, because I was so glad to have something cheerful to pull me out of the depression that I was sinking into.I didn't really have high expectations going in, but I certainly expected it to be a little more light-hearted, and to have a more cohesive plot.This movie is not worth full-price admission (or even matinee prices!). See it at the $1 show, and then only if you're a big Bullock/Kidman fan.",Practical Magic
183,Lang_G,"Wonderful, relaxing, good-feeling!",10,13 November 1998,"I loved this movie. A treat for the eyes (Kidman's as beautiful as ever), and something to enjoy, not analyze.It's worth seeing on the big screen, and it's on my list of movies to buy.",Practical Magic

The only movie in 1998 of which I doubted to leave during the break. It is so, so bad ... Can anybody tell me what the hell it is about ? NOTHING ! Don't get me wrong, I like now and then a light entertaining movie ... but this one just insulted my intelligence. I normally even like Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman but now their performances were the same level as the movie. The worst part is probably that I stayed till the end since we wanted to see if it would get any worse ... It did!",Practical Magic

Witchcraft is religion that people shouldn't dabble in so to speak, it is attractive and mysterious to many looking for alternative avenues to explore their spirituality. But watch out, tampering (even with good intent) be ready to accept responsibility for your actions. I sound like a parent telling my kids to be good. but really I'm just a ""good"" witch trying to promote a ""good"" name for a religion that is soooo misunderstood.

188,JSummers,Loved it,10,19 February 1999,"I just wanted to have my say. In my opinion Practical Magic was a brilliant Movie. As my one line summary suggests, I loved it. I wouldn't really see it over and over, however. The storyline was definitely original to me and the acting was rather well done. It was comical so as to relieve tension in certain situations and rather ironic in others. Not always predictable though some things you could see coming. Overall a GREAT night out.In the religious respect, Practical Magic did not show too much ignorance on the topic of Witchcraft. Naturally if it was entirely bound by 'realistic witchcraft' then the movie would not have been as enjoyable. The movie was educational to non-Witches such as friends of mine who now defend witches when they are thought of as demon worshipping hags. Great movie, go see it!",Practical Magic
189,emaleth,It's a great story of a family with a little bit of romance.,10,13 May 1999,"Definitely a must see for siblings!  It is a very touching story about two sisters.  More family oriented then anything else though there is comedy, drama, and romance in it.  I was highly impressed with it, even though the very end is a little corny.  Overall I highly enjoyed it.",Practical Magic
190,Alvaro-14,Waste of film,5,18 February 2003,"This movie, is nothing in particular, is not a comedy, is not a drama, is not romantic, is not scary. Is just a waste of film and money for those renting it.Actresses like Sandra, and Nicole must be more careful choosing there parts.Avoid it.",Practical Magic
191,pinbab,Wonderful Romantic Comedy,10,9 October 1999,I thought that this film was funny with a witchy twist. Stockard Channing did a wonderful job as the funny yet witty aunt. She was delightful. The story was romantic but twisted. The aunts gave the story a bit more comedy. They spiced it up. All in all I gave this movie an A+ just for the wonderful performances by the supporting roles.,Practical Magic
192,jrhbyh,Absolutely incredible,9,7 January 2000,"This movie varied a bit from the novel, but it brought it's own light to the story.  The special effects were not overwhelming; I thought they were even a bit necessary.  And those who stated that Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman were not at there best, were sorely mistaken.  Sandra's character, Sally, was not playing a 'weak woman' type, she was portraying Sally as an honest person who couldn't lie to the man she was meant to love.  I absolutely loved the movie and I watch it again and again.  The relationship between the two sisters is incredible and moving.  I find myself in tears at the exorcism scene.  Okay and whoever said that there spell or whatever wasn't accurate-- What in movies ever is absolutely a mirror of everyday life. HELLO... don't kill a movie because it has all the aspects of a typical movie.  I thought it transcended its expectations and brought the novel to life... a few details were omitted; that just makes both more enjoyable.",Practical Magic
193,alanna-3,"Predictable, unlogical, laughable,and oh yeah, just BAD.",1,22 May 2000,"I can't remember the last time I actually spent watching a movie that was complete GARBAGE.  Probably The Haunting.  It was actually hard for me to decide which was worse.  But I am going to give Practical Magic a close runner up. Where to begin:  lets start with the cliches:  brooms, potions, two old maids living together, dressed in 1800's clothes (WHY WHY WHY???). black cats, COME ON! the storyline:  Where is the climax?  Where is the plot?  These are hard to find because-THERE ARE NONE. and why why why, would the entire town be so afraid of them for 30 plus years, and then ""magically"" turn best buds when it come's time to do a spell/ exorcism? (did any body else feel that way-at times I thought Kidman was trying to be Linda Blair!).  And What on earth is up with the Phone tree????? why would every body have to have a meeting about it?  Does that happen in your home town?  Are people REALLY that rude and narrow minded?  Did that town look suspiciously like the one Sandra was in Hope Floats???  Why did Sandra run towards her future husband and he was running towards her-with out saying one word to each other?  What was the point of her owning the store?  And why were there like 5 workers doing nothing, and no customers?  If you woke up, with some one playing with your face, and found your sister you have not seen in 7+ years, don't you thing you would be the least bid shocked, or happy?  I just don't understand.the characters:  what can I say?  NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT HERE.  How can anyone watching this film have any feeling toward a character if they don't bring us one.  Sorry, none worth standing in this flick.  I did not care if Kidman (forgot her name in movie) stayed or went.  I did not care if Bullock feel in love or not.  I did not care if their aunt's came back, if they made margaritas or not (oh yeah-what a stupid scene, espically the direction, terrible.  Acting-non-convincing). CAN  WE SAY PREDICTABLE:  everyone knows that Adian Quinn (don't know his name in movie-even used?) is going to have one blue  eye, one green, he can flip pancakes, and has a star.  WOW.  I never saw THAT ONE coming!  (oh, and the whole pancake scene, especially when he flips it up in the air-just cheesy.  I have not seen such bad direction with a camera since the late 80's).  By the way, why could he kill off Kidman's ""DEAD"" boyfriend with the star!?!?! Was he a vampire? I really don't mean to rip this apart (well, I guess I do, because I am doing it) but I just don't understand why any of the cast made this. How did it get past viewing audiences?  Why did Kidman take this?  (Sad to say that I expect this from Bullock).  This whole mess is COMPLETELY unlogical, predictable, and just laughable (the last scence practically had me on the ground).  I can't get over this. 0.5/10 stars.(the .5 because there was a song from BOOGIE NIGHTS in it-the only enjoyable part of the film).",Practical Magic

I loved the story and the relationship between the characters.  I really can't think of anything about the move that I didn't like!

I watched it again recently, and I'd like to say that I really liked the way the theme (witchcraft) was presented and used. Mixing modern and traditional elements, natural and supernatural, the film is suspenseful but romantic, including witches and common people, concerning past and present. This variety of characteristics is, I believe, the greatest ""plus"" of the movie, along with satisfying performances by S. Bullock, N. Kidman, S. Channing, D. Wiest. ""Practical Magic"" is a must for paranormal-lovers, or for people looking for a drop of everything: fantasy, love, fun, suspense... in this interesting mixture by G. Dunne.",Practical Magic

I am stunned that so many people on here rated it so ""average"". it seems people that read the book are disappointed in the movie. I never read the book for this but I will say that I have yet to watch a movie that did justice to a book. Lets face it books leave more to the imagination allowing you to develop the characters a little more firsthand in your mind. I think it is unfair to compare a movie to the book and it sets you up for disappointment. I encourage those disappointed souls to wipe the book out of their mind and appreciate this movie for what it is- a whimsical charming lighthearted romantic drama/comedy.

200,sjr9,Nostalgic with a healthy dose of the arcane,8,9 April 2011,"I love this movie for personal, nostalgic reasons, one of them being that I saw this when I was around 9 years of age. After watching it many (MANY) times as an adult with a much better trained eye, I realize that, while its script is actually well written, there are a number of editing errors that are very noticeable (which you can either read about or see for yourself). The score, written by Alan Silvestri, has a touch of the Renaissance to it, with many well developed themes, and supports the movie well. The setting is quaint, but relatable. The supporting characters are not average by any means, but are still lovable in their own ""magical"" way. The main characters, Sally and Gillian, stand out as strong women deeply involved in their quest for normality while being drawn deeper into the things they fear most: a life less ordinary; complications of their current lives with their backgrounds; and the chance that they will never find love. While unrealistic in a few places (you'll see what I mean when you see it), most can be put toward the mystical qualities inherent in the main family of characters. I love this movie in spite of its flaws, most of which are incidental to the actual story line, and am glad to share my views on it with you all :)",Practical Magic

202,samanthalynnduarte,Thoroughly enjoyed it,9,29 December 2019,"Wow, some of the people reviewing this movie are a tough group of people. I have read the book and watched the movie. I have to say that I think the movie adaptation was quite clever considering how the book was written. It would have been quite difficult to adapt the book exactly as it was written because it focuses mainly on the relationship of the female characters and their inner beliefs, desires, and the daily navigation through everyday life. It would have been a terrible movie if it was exactly translated from book. Both the movie and the book could have taken more from the other and I think the movie plot worked better overall. Sandra and Nicole have excellent chemistry as sisters and the Aunts were perfectly cast as well. Personally I do not find the character of Gary in the movie attractive and I do not see the chemistry between him and Sandra compelling but that is the only negative comment I have.
I enjoyed both the movie and the book for different reasons and it was interesting to compare the differences.",Practical Magic

206,amanda-madden52,Hands down one of the best movies ever.,10,5 July 2013,"A great movie is one that covers the important things in life. Family, love, acceptance, and challenges. Practical magic covers all those things. It's a movie where you learn to accept those different from you, you learn about family, you learn about love, and you learn about magic.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman shine as sisters, Sally and Jillian Owens. They were born into a family of witches. Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest star, as they're eccentric but loving aunts Aunt Frances and Aunt Bridget respectively. The girls are sent to live with their aunts after their parents passed away. The Owens women are under a curse, it happens when they fall in love. The man they are in love with will die. One night while watching their aunts cast a spell for a woman desperately in love, Jillian decides to take a chance on love, while Sally decides to cast a spell to protect herself. Jillian leaves home from their small Massachusetts town, while Sally stays behind with their aunts. Before Jillian leaves, they cast a promise to each other, using the blood of their hands. It's one of the most touching scenes in the movie where you can see just how strong their bond is. Sally ends up falling in love with Michael, a produce salesman in town. The curse strikes again leaving Sally a widow, and a single mom of two daughters. Jillian finds herself in a bad relationship, and one night uses their bond to call on Sally when she's in trouble. Sally shows up and accidentally kills Jillian's boyfriend by using too much magic. But in a twist, he's not really dead and haunts the sisters until their family, and town come together to stop him. A stranger rolls in to town to investigate and finds himself strangely drawn to Sally. Would she take a chance on love again? Will the curse ever be broken? The end of the movie will leave you speechless. This movie is one of the greatest movies because it covers everything. The cast shines, the set and town where they chose to film set the scene perfectly, and the beginning gives you a clear picture of how the Owen women came to be. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",Practical Magic
207,caitlinapelt,Love It,10,4 May 2005,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time! I am not usually into the whole magic, fantasy thing but I just adore this movie. I love Nicole, she is my most favorite actress ever. I think she is a truly amazing and inspiring human, not only as an actress but as a person, a mother, friend, sister, daughter and celebrity. I see all her movies when they are released in Australia and there are not many celebrities I would go watch just because they are in the movie. I would love more than ever to meet her one day. Back to the movie. I think the connection as sisters Sandra and Nicole give to Sally and Gillian is so good in this movie. They portray this amazing bond between each other. Sometimes throughout the film they are not 'best friends' but the love is always there. I am no actress by any means but I cant see as that being easy to do as as far as I know they are not that close. To act that brilliantly as she does with all her movies in just phenomenal to me.

And the soundtrack is fabulous. And the cast is great, everyones character is portrayed so perfectly. The setting is also great, and it all fits perfectly together.

Truthfully, it's not for everyone, but if you like movies with a little bit of magic, sisterly bonding, and love, this is the movie to watch. The movie, which was based on a novel by Alice Hoffman, the best author to ever exist, flows together very beautifully. I especially love the connection between the two sisters played by Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. They did a great job expressing Sally and Ginnie's close relationship, despite their black and white personalities. The two aunts you can't help but love. During the movie, they encourage the sisters to embrace what they inherited and let them realize that ""being normal is vastly over rated."" Sally, on the other hand, wants to distance herself from magic as much as possible, but will soon realize that no matter how hard she tries, she cannot run from who she really is.",Practical Magic
211,willowdale36,A new written screenplay is what is much needed in this brew!,1,18 September 2018,"First, this may not be what you want to hear, READ THE BOOK. The movie is a big disappointment. The magic stirring cups are a disservice to the actual book plot; women who isolate themselves and hide their power; love for all the right & wrong reasons; use their gifts and minds to redeem themselves in the end. What we need is a remake of this movie with an entirely new screenplay- one that stays true to the book. (Think Sharp Objects!) The phoney magic and pumped up mayhem, every witch-way keystone cop run around with the bad guy plot only detract from a deeper felt story written by Ms. Hoffman.",Practical Magic

213,apepin,Awesome!,10,16 October 2005,"This movie was spectacular! The story and actors were great, but the visuals were the real star. I haven't read the book, but this is a really good story. The set design really took you to the places in the story. Some what creepy, but some what beautiful; quite amazing to watch.No Oscar winner, okay, but the perfect ""pop in a DVD"" and cuddle on the couch feel good movie. Nicole Kidman is really amazing, and Sandra Bullock is her lovable self. The ""Aunts"" are show-stoppers here to. Really funny Margarita scene....Great, great movie. You can't go wrong with this one. I own the DVD and watch it monthly...",Practical Magic
214,il_grande,Lazy evening bubblegum movie,4,10 January 2006,"Saw this last night, and was looking forward to watching a film with both Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock.As for the witchcraft aspect of the film, it looked all OK to me. Nothing was too wrong or inaccurate, after all, there are as many incarnations of witchcraft practices as there are shades of green. That is to say that any portrayal is not necessarily wrong, as there are no set teachings in what is right and what is wrong when practising the craft. So to the person who said it was totally incorrect when the bird is stabbed with the needle as Wicca doesn't do it, no. Your practice of wicca doesn't but other's might.My main complaints about the film are script and production inaccuracies. The first is when Kidman is saying that her boyfriend is from Bulgaria: ""close to Transilvania... he's got the whole Dracula-cowboy thing going on"". Please. Transilvania is a region in Romania - a totally different country. Even from the border of Bulgaria and Romania to Transilvania is at least a couple of hundred miles. The 2 countries are different in language and culture. I really hate when films from the USA get such basically simple but fundamental things such as geography wrong. It's not hard to get these things right! The second thing in the film, which is more of a goof... when Sandra Bullock had to go and rescue Nicole Kidman, the aunts were going to take the kids to the Solstic Celebrations. There are solstices a year. One on 21 June. The other on 21 December. The film was supposed to be set around the December solstice. There was no mention or indication of Christmas (or anything to do with the Christmas season) in the film. OK, witches may not necessarily put up a tree, etc. But in the scenes with Kidman in Arizona, or wherever, surely the motel would have had something Christmassy - from experience in the USA, 4 days before Christmas, everything has lights and decorations.I'm tired typing. But these were the 2 main issues which bugged me about the film since I saw it last night.",Practical Magic
