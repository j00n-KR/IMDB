0,TheLittleSongbird,Good enough,6,24 November 2010,"I won't lie and say I wasn't disappointed when I saw The Outsiders. I was a bit, considering it is from Francis Ford Coppola. It is well made, with great photography and great shots and camera angles. I also liked the story, it was nicely constructed and quite conventional, and the film moved briskly. The direction from Coppola is great, and the film further benefits from a great cast(Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Diane Lane, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez among others).However, Ralph Macchio and C Thomas Howell are rather wooden and unconvincing in their roles. Plus there is some stilted dialogue, and I wasn't taken with the music score which was too over-the-top for my taste. Overall, it had flaws but it was good enough. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Outsiders
1,bkoganbing,Stars In Training,10,18 November 2009,"S.E. Hinton's classic novel for young people has become a classic motion picture as well. The Outsiders with its all star cast of budding young Brat Packers reminds me a lot of the studio system films from days of yore. Francis Ford Coppola could never have afforded to pay all the players when they entered their prime earnings years which would be not to long in the future. Ironic that the biggest name in this film, Tom Cruise, has the smallest role in The Outsiders.The main character of the film is C. Thomas Howell who is the youngest of three brothers who are orphaned with oldest Patrick Swayze raising his siblings as best he can. The middle brother is Rob Lowe. All of them are from the wrong side of the tracks of their small Oklahoma town and are just referred to as 'greasers' or 'hoods'.In the pecking order above them are the upper middle class kids, preppies or jocks who are referred to as 'Sosh'. We never do find out exactly what the origin of the name was, probably it's in the novel. But the Soshs look down on the greasers and the greasers resent the soft life of privilege they see the other group apparently has. It's a dividing line they don't cross.When Howell's best friend Ralph Macchio kills Leif Garrett trying to save Howell from Garrett and his friends trying to drown him, the two boys have to run away. The film follows them on their journey which contains both tragedy, but also a realization that life isn't just made up of greasers and Soshs.Besides those already mentioned Matt Dillon and Emilio Estevez are also greasers in good standing. Dillon has a key role in the film as kind of a mentor greaser to the younger kids like Macchio and Howell. Watching The Outsiders takes me back to my youth when I was doing basic training for the Army Reserve. I saw so many kids like the greasers in basic training for a hitch in the real army. This is exactly where the military gets a lot of its recruits, kids like the greasers who have no real life and look to get away from kind of situation all the greaser kids are in.Francis Ford Coppola got perfect performances from his cast of budding stars. My favorite has to be Ralph Macchio as Johnny Cade. He's a kid from an abusive home who seeks acceptance and identity with the gang, he envies C. Thomas Howell for at least having the two older brothers. His scene with Howell where he sobs and wishes for a world without greasers or Soshs is a poignant heartbreaker. If Macchio didn't later become the Karate Kid, The Outsiders would have given him a career role.The Outsiders, book and film, is destined to be a classic centuries from now. It's one of the best films from the Reagan Eighties.",The Outsiders
2,SnoopyStyle,so earnest and so artificial,6,13 March 2015,"Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell), Dallas Winston (Matt Dillon) and Johnny Cade (Ralph Macchio) are three of the Greasers from the poor north side of town. Dal harasses Cherry Valance (Diane Lane) at the drive-in. Ponyboy, Johnny and Two-Bit Matthews (Emilio Estevez) befriend the girls. Ponyboy's brother Sodapop (Rob Lowe) works at the gas station. He doesn't get along with his oldest brother Darrel (Patrick Swayze) since their parents died. The Socs are the rich kids from the south side. Cherry's boyfriend Bob Sheldon (Leif Garrett) is a drunk. Later that night, Ponyboy runs away from home with Johnny. Bob and a car full of Socs track them down to fight. Ponyboy is almost drowned but Johnny stabs and kills Bob. Dallas helps them hide out in an abandoned church. Later, they decide to return. On the way, they rescue a group of children trapped in a burning church. Johnny is severely burnt and hospitalized. The Socs and The Greasers prepare to fight.Director Francis Ford Coppola has created something unreal and nostalgic. It's a beautiful piece of cinematic art. It's almost a throwback to another era. The dialog is clunky but the mannered speech creates its own atmosphere. It has an interesting artificial quality which Coppola's beautiful look can only enhance. There is something beautiful about this and the great young cast doesn't hurt.",The Outsiders
3,Horst_In_Translation,"If you give this the right approach, it will be a good watch.",6,18 August 2017,"""The Outsiders"" is an American/French co-production from 1983 that resulted in this English language film that is going to have its 35th anniversary next year. The director here is a certain Francis Ford Coppola and a decade after taking us into the world of organized crime, he takes us now into the world of youth gangs that commit a fair share of their own crimes as well. If you see the names of Dillon, Macchio, Lowe, Cruise, Flea, Waits, Estevez and others in here, you will find a group of young actors that managed tremendous careers in the years or even decades to come. It is somewhat ironic that next to all these big names, C. Thomas Howell did not manage a huge breakthrough as he is probably playing the most central character in here. Coppola's very young daughter Sofia, an Oscar winner now, is in it too briefly. The biggest female character is played by the tremendously beautiful Diane Lane back then and even she does not have that much screen time. It's all about the boys. The film is certainly channeling stuff like West Side Story, Rebel Without a Cause and some early Marlon Brando works a bit, so it is definitely not FFC's most original work. But like I wrote in the title, it is still easy to enjoy this movie if you give it the right approach. Don't go in it expecting Godfather quality. I personally think it could have been a bit shorter and more focused, but then again I watched the version that comes close to two hours and not the original 90-minute version. I suggest you go for that one instead perhaps.The film was successful enough for them to make a television show afterward and I see that one was pretty successful too, even if it only ran for one short season. Back to the movie, I see this was discussed pretty controversially. Some loved it, some think it's garbage. Decide for yourself. I think it was a good watch from that moment on when it really started to focus on three characters only. Those were the days when you could be called Ponyboy or wear a Mickey Mouse shirt and people still think you're badass. The ending with the faces (and even more the words) of the two dead characters may have been a bit on the pretentious side, but I can forgive them for it because Macchio really gives a good performance and portrays the most memorable character in here, a really good kid that makes a not necessarily wrong decision with horrible consequences, but stays a loyal friend and saves even some kids' lives later on. A perfect example of how his financial situation and as a consequence the people he hangs out with really literally destroy his life. Oh yeah and they really are outsiders as police only care for them when they have to shoot them. A good outcome here I would say and if you like Elvis, you are in for an even bigger treat. Go check it out.",The Outsiders

Late night, a group of The Socials chase and severely beat up on Johnny and drown Ponnyboy in a fountain. However Johnny stabs one Socs and kills him, saving Ponnyboy. The desperate boys seek Dallas and he indicates a hideout for them in a nearby town. One week later, Johnny and Ponnyboy decide to return to their hometown with Dallas to claim self-defense. But in their way back, they see a school on fire and the trio helps the children trapped in the school becoming heroes. However Johnny is badly wounded and interned in the hospital. Meanwhile The Socs and The Greasers schedule a fight with tragic consequences.""The Outsiders"" was a huge success with the teenagers in Brazil in the 80's. The dramatic story of self-destructive teenagers that spend their lives in empty gang fights is engaging and I have watched this movie at least four times. In 2009, it is great to see the cast composed of future stars in the beginning of their careers. After more than three decades, this film has become a classic. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Vidas Sem Rumo"" (""Adrift Lives"")Note: On 10 May 2019 I saw this film again.",The Outsiders
5,kosmasp,Insiders,9,18 August 2021,"I never had seen this movie before ... but I had heard about it. And it makes sense ... such a rich and wonderful cast. It's incredible how many young actors got into this that got famous later. You see Tom Cruise in one scene and then he's gone for half an hour or something. It's not his movie see? But still with so many recognizable faces ... just that alone might make you love this.Now I have not read the book this is based on, so I can't say anything about how this was translated to the screen. Others seem to say mostly that it is accurate. I can say that it is quite powerful and feels sometimes a bit like the Warriors with a bit of social drama thrown into the mix and less thriller aspects. Both wonderful movies to say the least, for different reasons.There is a lot of hardship and heartache ... there are scenes that are cringe worthy. But even for that time Diane Lanes character does not just fall for the rude tactics or whatever you want to call it when Matt Dillons character is hitting on her ... he is pestering her and nowadays you'd call it sexual harassment (it was back then too, but it wasn't called out - at least not publicly). Those things aside, there is so much drama, so many relationships and a lot of story the movie goes through ... and a lot of relatable characters. Mostly male of course, but still.",The Outsiders
6,classicsoncall,"""Must be someplace with just plain ordinary people.""",7,11 November 2021,"Funny how time changes things, and I'm not even talking about the story line. A present day star like Tom Cruise is hardly visible in the picture, while C. Thomas Howell, who had the lead role as Ponyboy Curtis, I am totally unfamiliar with, even though he has an extensive list of credits. Even without an almost obligatory sex scene, this was quite the coming of age story for rival teenage gangs, both of which harbored a narrow minded perception of their opposite members. Considering the stabbing death of 'Soc' Bob (Leif Garrett), virtually no amount of screen time dealt with the aftermath of his killing, although the subsequent death from his injuries made it a moot point that Johnny (Ralph Macchio) would ever be put to a trial, especially after the newspapers touted him and his buddies as heroes for saving a handful of kids from a disastrous fire. You get a sense of the angst felt by guys like Soc Randy (Darren Dalton), and Greasers Ponyboy and Johnny, that life is passing them by as they stay trapped in their comfort zones, whether it be on the right or wrong side of the tracks. Ultimately it's character that wins out, rather than who emerges from a rumble as victors. With quite a handful of actors who went on to bigger and better things, this is a film that has points to make about growing up and taking responsibility, and seeing the good in a person that often stays hidden until tragedy strikes.",The Outsiders
7,gavin6942,An Interesting Adaptation of a Great Book,7,9 May 2015,"The rivalry between two gangs, the poor Greasers and the rich Socs, only heats up when one gang member kills a member of the other.What makes this movie so great is the cast: so many young actors on the verge of making it big. Tom Cruise before he became a megastar, Rob Lowe in his first picture. Interestingly, the lead actor -- C. Thomas Howell -- may have gone on to be the least well-known of them all (though still kind of a big deal).Some of this translates well from the book, and some not as much. The dialogue is a bit silly at times, and often drowned out by the music. The camera shots and fade outs are strange, and a bit artistic for this story. And then there is the whole, deeply homoerotic undertone of much of the movie (especially with Johnny)... clearly not intended, but still there.",The Outsiders
8,lee_eisenberg,It actually did stay pretty faithful to the book. And it shows that Tom Cruise was better before he got into cool guy roles.,10,20 September 2005,"People often debate which was Francis Ford Coppola's best movie ever: one of the ""Godfather"" movies or ""Apocalypse Now"". While I would argue for the latter, I would also like to say that ""The Outsiders"" should be #2. This movie is so great that I can't describe it. Told from the perspective of Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell), it's the story of several destitute teenage boys and young men in 1966 Oklahoma, and their struggle to belong in the world. The movie ranges from sad - when Johnny Cade (Ralph Macchio) dies from burns sustained in a church fire - to funny - when Keith ""Two-Bit"" Mathews (Emilio Estevez) drinks beer for breakfast while watching cartoons. With great support from Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise and Diane Lane, this is one movie that you just have to see.",The Outsiders
9,jboothmillard,The Outsiders,5,13 May 2021,"I had heard about this film a few times in the past, I knew it was famous for launching the careers of its up-and-coming stars, I was hoping it would be something good as well, directed by Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Bram Stoker's Dracula). Basically, set in the mid-1960s, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, greasers are tough, low-income working-class teens. They include Ponyboy Curtis (E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial's C. Thomas Howell) and his two older brothers, Darrel, aka Darry (Patrick Swayze), and Sodapop, aka Soda (Rob Lowe), as well as Johnny Cade (Ralph Macchio), Dallas ""Dally"" Winston (Matt Dillon), Keith ""Two-Bit"" Matthews (Emilio Estevez), and Steve Randle (Tom Cruise). Their rivals are the Socs (pronounced ""SO-shiz"", short for Socials), wealthier kids from the other side of town. The Curtis brothers live in the family home, with eldest Darry taking a parental role because their parents died in an accident, while their friends come and go as they please. One night, following a trip to the drive-in movie theatre, Pony and Johnny are ambushed by Bob Sheldon (Leif Garrett), Randy Anderson (Darren Dalton), and another three drunken Socs members. The boys are attacked, with Johnny beaten up and Ponyboy almost drowned in a fountain. Ponyboy blacks out, and when he wakes up, he finds Johnny traumatised holding a blood-stained switchblade having killed Bob, whose lifeless body is nearby, while the others have fled. Following advice from Dally, Ponyboy and Johnny hide on a cargo train headed towards Windrixville and hide out in an abandoned church. They change their appearances, both cutting their hair, while Ponyboy bleaches his hair. Johnny feels guilty for killing Bob, even though it was in self-defence and cries after talking about the incident. To pass time, the boys play poker and Ponyboy reads Gone with the Wind. After a few days, Dally arrives with news that Sherri ""Cherry"" Valance (Diane Lane) has offered to support the boys in court, and that he told the police that Johnny and Pony were in Texas. He gives Ponyboy a note from Sodapop, asking to come home and that Darry is sorry. While the three eat lunch at Dairy Queen, Johnny says that they must turn themselves in, but Dally disagrees. When the boys return to the church, they find the building on fire. But worse is that children are trapped inside. The Greasers rescue the kids from the burning church; Ponyboy is not really hurt, but Johnny and Dally are injured. Dally's injuries are not serious, but Johnny suffers a broken back and severe burns. Ponyboy reunites with his brothers and they all hug tightly. The boys are praised for their heroism, but Johnny is charged with manslaughter for killing Bob, while Ponyboy may be sent to a boys' home. Bob's death sparks the Socs to demand a ""rumble"". On the day of the rumble, Randy wants to talk to Ponyboy. Having read about their heroics in the newspaper, he admits he did not expect him to be heroic and says he will have no part in the rumble. Later, Ponyboy and Two-Bit visit Johnny in the hospital room, Johnny admits that he previously felt suicidal but wants to live. Ponyboy and Two-Bit then visit Dally in his hospital room, he says that they must win the rumble for Johnny. Cherry visits Ponyboy to talk about court, and she tells him that she doesn't want to visit Johnny because he killed Bob. Ponyboy thinks that Cherry is betraying them and doesn't know how bad the Socs are and leaves. Later that night, the Greasers meet up with the gang led by Tim Shepard (Glenn Withrow) for the rumble. The Greasers and Socs exchange a few words, and then Dally arrives just before the fight begins, which the Greasers ultimately win. After the rumble, Dally drives an injured Ponyboy to the hospital to visit Johnny. They tell Johnny about the Greasers' victory in the rumble, but Johnny is unimpressed and dies after telling Ponyboy to ""stay gold"", referring to the Robert Frost poem ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"". Unable to bear Johnny's death, Dally leaves the hospital and robs a grocery store, but he is shot and wounded by the owner as he flees. Pursued by the police, Dally is eventually surrounded in a park and, feeling suicidal, provokes them to shoot him dead. Everyone goes to court for Bob's murder and the judge pleads Ponyboy not guilty. After court, Cherry sees Ponyboy at school and ignores him. During an argument between Darry and Ponyboy, Sodapop flees as they follow him. They stop as Sodapop confesses that they can't live like that anymore and that they must start to understand each other to get along which they all agree on then go home. Ponyboy is eventually cleared of wrongdoing in Bob's death and allowed to stay with his brothers. Reading Johnny's copy of Gone with the Wind, Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny saying that saving the children was worth sacrificing his own life. The story ends with Ponyboy writing a school report about his recent experiences. Also starring Michelle Meyrink as Marcia, Tom Waits as Buck Merrill and Sofia Coppola as Little Girl. While Swayze, Lowe, Dillon, Estevez, and Cruise are the stars that went to bigger success, it is Howell and Macchio that are the main protagonists, the others only have small scenes. Having made the big movie that was Apocalypse Now, Coppola made this much smaller film, the 1960s recreation is done relatively well, the dialogue is perhaps daft and there are predictable moments, but there is enough material and obviously the recognisable young stars to keep you watching, not a bad coming-of-age crime drama. Worth watching!",The Outsiders
10,ma-cortes,"Melodramatic and enjoyable Francis Ford Coppola movie with amazing cast , most of them made great career",7,26 November 2020,"A cult and nostalgic movie with a lot of newcomers stars to have many of them a long and successful cinematic career. It deals with the rivalry between two youngsters bands : The Soshes and the Greasers : Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, C Thomas Howell, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise , Emilio Estevez , all of them made great prolific career strides , not even Francis Ford could have afforded such luxurious number of stars a decade after. The latter rival gang acting naturally from the wrong side of the tracks and concerning their rebel conflicts with the traditional society and each other. And focusing on the Greasers and two very young members Greasers : C Thomas Howell and Ralph Macchio , being really helped by the rogue delinquent played by Matt Dillon and by a good young girl : Diane Lane . Exploring especially the relation between them , both of whom go on the run later one of them has murdered a Sosh in defense of his friend .There are continuous confrontation among the bands and Coppola gets some stirring and touching moments towards the ending.A nice film for youth , including drama , agreeable relationships, sensibility and a great number of fights among bands tending to fall foul of the law . Based on the popular S.E. Hinton novel and Francis Ford Coppola himself adapted another Hinton book the same year : Rumble Fish with Matt Dillon and Mickey Rourke and being followed by a TV series . Considered to be a Cult film that had a big hit , here Coppola follows the footsteps of classic movies in "" West Side Story"" , ""Rebel with no cause"" and ""American Graffiti style"" .It packs a good and sensitive soundtrack by Carmine Coppola, Francis Ford's father . As well as evocative and colorful cinematography by Stephen Burum with plenty of brilliant and glamorous colour. The film was compellingly made by one of the best filmmakers , Francis Ford Coppola . This director has made great films as ""The Conversation"", ""Apocalypse Now"" , ""Rumble Fish"" , ""Gardens of Stone"", ""The Godfather"" saga and of course this ""Outsiders"" that is deemed to be one of the best ones . Although overdone , and excesively melodramatic but adolescents still love very much this exciting yarn. A cult above average movie for fans of the various new stars that participated in this Coppola masterpiece. Essential and fundamental watching for Francis Ford Coppola enthusiasts and completists .

11,Quinoa1984,"thoughts from a 20-something seeing the movie (the ""Complete Novel"" version) for the first time... it's OK",8,7 February 2010,"Francis Ford Coppola always takes chances and risks as a filmmaker, and though it might appear like he's playing it 'safe' in doing The Outsiders (he needed a hit after bombing with One From the Heart), it's still no less a risk than any of his other major works. And it is in fact a major work - just not one of his best, not by a longshot. The thinking here was to take a very popular pubescent-age book (not read by me, I'm probably one of the few who didn't though I had heard of it) and get a bunch of actors who could first play the parts well and then bring in the kids to see it, and then Coppola could tool around with it how he wanted.How he wanted exactly was to make The Outsiders as if Nicholas Ray were doing Rebel Without a Cause again with a bunch of wannabe James Deans (and you have to be a certain kind of dude to want to be James Dean after all) and throw in some rockabilly and music from the period, plus a bit more violence and language not allowed in the late 50's and early 60's. It's a tale of youth gone awry, from either lack of attention (as DJ Jazzy Jeff would say, parents just don't understand), and left to their own devices, which is to get into fights, flirt with girls, and sometimes just mope or drink. When one of the kids, Johnny (Ralph Macchio) kills one of a rival gang, the Socs, by accident, he and Ponyboy (C. Thomas Howell) go on the run to lay low. Things don't quite go as planned when they become sort of heroes saving some kids from a burning church, and they have to go back to town to face what they did.Oh, there's a lot of drama here... make that, melodrama, as it is something of a ""d*** flick"" (and I say that in the way some movies are ""chick flicks""), with lots of posturing and tough talk, and sometimes some really corny bits. Make that extremely corny, such a Johnny and Ponyboy looking at the yellow sky and reciting quotes from the Gone With the Wind book they're reading (seriously, no offense to the book, but what ""Greaser"" would be reading that?) There's some hammy acting, some sentimental notes, and its bittersweet climax is only marginally satisfying as far as conclusions go. Perhaps there is more in the Hinton text, or maybe less. Not all of Coppola's artistic choices here go awry- one thing that was striking, for example, was Ponyboy's dream about his parents being killed by a train- and his choice in songs, save for the opening Stevie Wonder song, are fantastic.But there is a lot of, shall I say it, corny things going on in a film that purports to be about street gangs and rumbles - a Tulsa, OK version of West Side Story and some of Rebel Without a Cause thrown in. Maybe kids will find it better (or, as some of the reaction on this site has shown, won't), but the film has its moments and merit. For one thing actors like Matt Dillon and C. Thomas Howell show how talented they are: Dillon especially chews on the scenery while making it believable (""Johnny!"" lines are the best), and it's fun seeing the ""Brat Pack"" assembled, like Estevez, Cruise, Diane Lane, Macchio. Yet there's something missing from The Outsiders, a really strong dramatic thrust to take the story along. We're invested with the characters but only on the surface; the film is a collection of scenes with a vague central arc that does get resolved, but not with the kind of dramatic strength we've seen in other Coppola movies.Bottom line, not a bad film by any stretch, but not as powerful as you might be lead to believe. Out of the two Hinton adaptations Coppola made in 1983, Rumble Fish far and away knocks it out of the park as an artistic achievement (albeit also about street gangs and 50's rocker style).",The Outsiders
12,JohnHowardReid,Curiously Unmoving!,5,11 July 2015,"Curiously unmoving, despite convincingly realistic performances and a great deal of money rolling around – though notice that the schoolhouse they burn down also doubles as the empty church. The problem is that what the movie has to say is not only familiar but pretentious. Greasers spouting Robert Frost are not my idea of realism. All the buddy-buddy stuff also moves the film into the same fantasy land that some of the more far-fetched incidents contrive. Beyond some special effect camera tricks, Coppola's direction seems mundane and ordinary. He tends to use close-ups that do nothing but reinforce the banality of much of the dialogue . Scissoring would probably not help. The music score and the photography are better than the movie deserves.",The Outsiders

15,preppy-3,Overdone but has its moments,7,17 August 2009,"Adaptation of S.E. Hinton's classic teenage novel. This takes place in Oklahoma around the early 1960s. There are two gangs in a town--Greasers (kids who come from poor families) and Socs (kids from rich families). These groups are always fighting. At one point a bunch of Socs almost kill greaser Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) but his friend Johnny (Ralph Macchio) saves him by stabbing a Soc to death. They skip town with the help of Dallas (Matt Dillon) but the two gangs are going to have an all out rumble for revenge.I saw this up a theatre in 1983. I sort of liked it...but it was lacking. I loved the book and heard the film was going to be faithful BUT the released film was cut by 30 minutes leaving it a disjointed mess. Characters appear and disappear at random and main characters in the book are hardly in it (Lowe's part was brutally reduced). I just saw the uncut 2005 restoration last night. In some ways it's better-- the gaps in the storyline are gone and it's not as disjointed as it was earlier and the soundtrack has been totally changed and songs from the period are put in instead that help the atmosphere. However it fails overall. This movie was shot on a BIG scale--far too big for a simple story like this. Coppola seems to think he was directing ""Gone With the Wind"" (with some shots taken directly from it!). The period music seems to be put in at random--more often than not the songs don't match the images! Also there's one climax too many. The rumble and aftermath should have ended the film (as it did originally) but this film goes on for about 20 minutes longer than needed. There's also a sequence with Lowe and Howell sleeping in bed together which has a huge gay subtext--intentional or not, it's there.Still, the movie does have its good moments and it's fun to see Lowe (his film debut), Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise, Diane Lane and Patrick Swayze so young. The acting is all good except for Dillon. He IS a good actor but he's pretty bad here. All in all the film isn't terrible but it's very overdone. Still it's worth a look. I give it a 7.",The Outsiders
16,CinemaSerf,So many careers started here...,6,16 October 2021,"Hmmm. Francis Ford Coppola has creatively produced a piece of superbly photographed and frequently quite intimate observational cinema here this is far more remarkable for it's casting than for anything especially innovative about the story or the characterisations. Indeed had seven of this cast not gone on to great and good things - to varying degrees - then I'm afraid I can't think this film would rate much better than as an interesting, ""West Side Story"" style derivate with neither the style nor the personalities. It is essentially a gang enmity film - the ""Greasers"" consisting of those at the top of the bill - (a rather toothy) Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze et al having a constant rivalry with their wealthier rivals from the other side of town - The ""Socs"" (Soshes). Every day there are skirmishes between the two until one evening, young Macchio (""Johnny"") and pal ""Ponyboy"" (C. Thomas Howell) are set upon by a group of older lads and tragedy ensues, a tragedy that leads to all concerned discovering and displaying their true colours. Unfortunately, the acting here is all pretty wooden - except, perhaps, for a decent last minute effort from Rob Lowe. Dillon was a good looking man, but like the others here he was never an especially versatile actor and much of the emphasis here is upon the fact they look good in 501s. The story is otherwise a rather humdrum, violent, coming of age effort that ends in sadness and salvation - but is delivered in an almost rushed fashion. Time hasn't been terribly kind to this, it has lost much of what made it potent at the time - but it is still a story worth a watch.",The Outsiders

In addition, it's a story of retaining one's innocence and sense of wonder and making the most of one's youth.In spite of the engaging plot and the profound themes, the most amazing thing about the movie is the cast. While the only known names at the time in the cast are Tom Waits and William Smith (and each of them has about 30 seconds of screen time and 2-3 lines), it is the then- unknowns whose names boggle the mind. Coppola could not have known at the time but he inadvertently cast the greatest all- star cast in the history of movies: Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Diane Lane, Matt Dillon, Emilio Estevez, Ralph Macchio, C Thomas Howell. All of these became stars, but were relatively unknown at the time.The extras even include Flea (of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame) and Heather Langenkamp (Nightmare on Elm Street).Just about every character you see is played by someone who was then unknown but later became huge. Great for star-spotting, especially to see the origins of current stars, and so many of them too.A great movie with a great, stars-in-the-making cast.",The Outsiders
18,view_and_review,Drew Me In,8,11 August 2019,"I didn't expect this movie to draw me in the way it did. Even with the start-studded cast I figured a movie about Greasers and Socs would be entertaining but nothing I'd be emotionally invested in. Then Ponyboy (C. Thomas Howell) had a reunion with his brother Daryl (Patrick Swayze) in the hospital. I know, I can't believe it either. It caught me totally off-guard. I really didn't see myself having an eye-wiping moment there.Then, just to add to the tissue tapping, Johnny (Ralph Macchio) dies. Come on S.E. Hinton!You know, his death didn't move me at the moment of his death, but once Ponyboy told Daryl it hit me. Once it was put into words that Johnny was in fact dead I felt the pain. It was a jarring moment.So, I found myself looking deeper into the characters. Ponyboy and Johnny's act of bravery carried with it the understanding that they weren't mere punks that greased their hair and got into trouble. They were dealt a terrible hand in life and that's the road that suited them best. They wanted more but saw that the world had little sympathy or patience people like them.And Dallas (Matt Dillon), though he feigned toughness, was the most fragile of all of them. Johnny's death was so catastrophic for him that it drove him to suicide by cop.The feud between the Greasers and the Socs was just a backdrop, it was almost background noise compared to the character development of Ponyboy, Johnny--and to a lesser degree--Dallas. Even though I thought the soundtrack was overbearing at times I saw very little wrong with this film.",The Outsiders
19,safenoe,A powerhouse cast for sure,7,8 June 2021,"What a cast, what a movie! The Outsiders is like the debutante of future Hollywood talent that's for sure. Based on S. E. Hinton's novel, this really hits the spots. Whilst the acting is a bit wrought at times, it still teaches you about class rivalries.Maybe one day The Outsiders can be remade with an all-female cast or a LGBTI one for balance and wokeness.",The Outsiders
20,mm-39,Great actors vs a great book,6,8 October 2017,"The Outsiders had a all star cast of known 80's actors. C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise of course. Charlie Sheen must of been on vacation somewhere to miss out!?! Oh I forgot and Diane Lane was also part of the class. Surprisingly Matt Dillon had the stand out role as the troubled youth. Sadly, Matt Dillon became type cast as the troubled leather jacket youth the rest of the his career. Macchio, Howell and the rest did a decent job considering the material. I never read the Outsiders but the movie must of followed the book closely. The Outsiders gets across more like a book than a movie. Frequently, great books badly transition to the screen. The Outsiders has an interesting story, with a social message of what is good person? The Macchio characters vs the Dillon creates the movie's argument of Plato's what is the good person/life question? The surprise ending pounds the message! Regrettably, The Outsiders gets across more like play then a movie, with the dialog and acting. The camera and set work was like the movie 300 with a feel of a comic book. If the director/scrip write does not tweak the story and character book movies comes across as dry. Omitting characters, changing scenes, condense the story is usually done to avoid a dry story. I would not call The Outsiders a Classic movie, but not a bad movie either. 6 out of 10 stars.",The Outsiders
21,Mr-Fusion,An outsider opinion,5,30 April 2019,"Really couldn't get into this one. Melodramatic and lumbering at the same time, The Outsiders plays best as a snapshot of future movie stars before they hit it big; that, and Coppola's evident fondness for that romantic period look. Now, there are a couple of dark turns that bring about the end credits, so I get how this probably touched a nerve thirty-five years ago. But it lacks any real dramatic heft.",The Outsiders
22,StevePulaski,Teens Run the Area,9,3 July 2010,"When knowing the book and hearing all about it for the matter of three years I finally got the chance to read it. Not a chance, more like a ""had no choice"" opportunity to read the book in school. I was surprised about how much I liked the book. I loved the constant conflict between the upper/lower class. It depicts as closely as possible to identify and show how things were like in 1966. Not to mention the plethora of stars in the film that weren't even to well known in the movie.Time for the cast roll call; C. Thomas Howell, fresh off E.T. and before The Hitcher in 1986. Patrick Swayze, the ""teen-dream"" who would later become an icon of film before passing away in late 2009. Matt Dillon and Rob Lowe, two teens that many girls don't know in great context, but love anyways. Move out of the way, Pattinson and Lautner. Then we get in the characters people overlook, like Ralph Macchio. Not the best looking, but does a great performance for such a young age. We have pre-Scientologist Tom Cruise in this picture as well. I wonder if he was introduced to Oprah's couch in 1983? Then we have the show stealer, in my humble world, pre-Brat Pack Emilio here delivering some grade A film-making.Many focus too much on the bodies of Rob Lowe and Matt Dillon, and less on the overall plot. The guys are very handsome and provide lots to offer, but stay realistic even in 1983 dreams rarely became reality. The book is about a lower class gang of underprivileged minors nicknamed ""The Greasers"" and an upper class band of jocks nicknamed ""The Socs"". Both gangs are notorious for their constant fighting and threatening of each side. Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) is telling the story of his life with his two brothers Sodapop and Darry (Rob Lowe and Patrick Swayze). The names of the cast sound more like energy drinks than the names of regular people.The gang of Greasers is made up by the cast stated above. Emilio, Cruise, Dillon, Lowe, Macchio, Howell, and Swayze make up the lower class. Not many pre-big named actors portrayed The Socs, so the uneven development to each side is a disappointment. I'd at least expect Johnny Depp to show up as a Soc. At least we see Leif Garrett.The film's main focus is watching The Greasers cope with the frustration of family life and gang life. Nearly every Greaser has a trouble with them. Since Ponyboy's parents died, Darry and Sodapop take care of him. Dally and Johnny have rough home lifes as well and aren't afraid to get emotional when driving through the topic. The film really gets you thinking about how gang life really was. This shows growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, and how life was before technology walked into the picture.Instead of listening to their iPods and playing games on the Xbox 360, The Greasers hang out around the neighborhood or at the park, more often than not leading to trouble with the gangs once more. If it's one thing we learned from this movie, it's that curfew matters.The book/film relationship is a little dull. Book fans will be disappointed that key scenes in the book are absent in the film. One female character doesn't even get so much as a mention. Though overall, it underrated and should deserve way more recognition than had since 1983. The ensemble cast is great, plus with the depiction of realistic characters and plot points, The Outsiders is a great read, a fabulous watch, and a touching story.Starring: C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, Tom Cruise, Leif Garrett, and Diane Lane. Directed by: Francis Ford Coppola.",The Outsiders

This film in a nutshell is West Side Story without the love story, the singing, or the dancing, so in some ways if you got scarred of that, you needn't worry any more.This is an incredible cast that you would never imagine at the time would make it so far in life, like Matt Dillion, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estovez, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swaze, etc. They play ""The Outsiders"", just the rebels of the town, but trouble ensues when the preps attack them and in defense one of them accidentally kills one of the preps and a huge rival happens.Over all, I'd say that it's a decent flick, it's a bit dated, but it's very intense and I'd say actually a good movie to watch. It set a bar for these actors and they might not be where they are today, they had some pretty great performances. I do love that line ""We're doing it for Johnny!"". :) So, go ahead and grab the popcorn for this one! 6/10",The Outsiders
24,MovieAddict2016,One of Coppola's last effective films,7,21 October 2005,"In 1982 and 1983 Francis Ford Coppola adapted two films from novels by author S.E. Hinton, both dealing with the rites of passage regarding rough teenagers living on the streets.""The Outsiders"" follows Johnny and Ponyboy (Ralph Macchio and C. Thomas Howell) as they run away from home and are attacked by another gang, The Socs, at a water fountain. Johnny kills some of them, the others run away and the ""greasers"" flee to the care of a friend (Matt Dillon) who tells them to run away and that he'll join them later.This sparks a whole chain of events as the rival gangs' violence towards each other escalates.The movie has a flawless cast featuring supporting performances by actors like Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise (in one of his first roles), Diane Lane, Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez.This forms a nice companion piece to ""Rumble Fish,"" which is a superior film in my opinion; of interesting note is that Dillon and Lane both returned to work with Coppola, so presumably their experience the year before was enjoyable.""The Outsiders"" is not a great film but it is effective and one of the last movies Francis Ford Coppola made before he altogether lost his artistic vision and sold out by making poor excuses for films like ""Jack"" (1996). The new DVD features a ""recut"" of the film, which is supposedly better and more faithful to the book, which has a huge cult following amongst young teens in particular.",The Outsiders
25,Robert_duder,"A moving, no holds barred coming of age film",9,12 March 2006,"I am ashamed to say as a fan of literature that I have not read the novel. But the cast of this film intrigued me a great deal and I love 80's Brat Pack films so I had to check it out. What a gripping, very real, look at cliques and emotion and young people living on the edge. Veteran film maker Francis Ford Coppola puts together a gritty, emotional ride revolving around two very different groups of young people, ""Greasers"" and ""Socs"" (pronounced Soashes). The best part of the film is that any one person can relate to at least one of the character from either side of the group. It examines the relations between two different cliques which everyone experiences in life but especially younger people in school and such.The lead is played by C. Thomas Howell back when he could apparently actually act and before his career went completely toilet side. I can say without any hesitation this is his best performance. He does a terrific job as Ponyboy Curtis. His parents have died and his oldest brother is doing the very best he can to raise him and give the opportunities and future that he or their other brother never had. Howell is just the essential, normal, troubled kid that so many could relate to. He suffers through learning to deal with the loss of his parents, his best friend in the whole world and the people he knows around him. Determined to find his place in the world he shows some of his tougher skinned friends that the world is a beautiful place even in the shadow of bad things happening. Ralph Macchio plays his best friend Johnny Cade. Macchio also does an incredible job of playing the troubled teen whose parents are alcoholic abusers who barely notice him. His emotion and tears touch you every time and his death is heart breaking. Macchio who of course is best known as The Karate Kid gives his best performance in The Outsiders as well. Patrick Swayze, in his rather small role, as older brother/father figure to Ponyboy and the other kids in the neighborhood does a good job with what is given to him. You certainly get a feel for his struggle and his tough time dealing with the loss of his parents and you get a hint in the story of what he lost out on to take care of his brothers. He struggled to hold onto them no matter what. Despite these performances being good no one holds a flame to what actor Matt Dillon pulls off in this film as bad ass Dallas Winston (Dally.) An ex-con who is only still young, but is hardened by crime and life on the streets. He still pulls out all the stops to protect his friends when one of them (Johnny Cade) kills a Soc. defending Ponyboy. Dillon's emotions and performance absolutely moves you in such a powerful way. He's a commanding presence and never having been a huge Dillon fan he won me over easily in this performance. Now I understand where his fame was based this being one of his earliest films. The supporting cast is made up of young up and comers who did ended up making themselves into real names....Tom Cruise (one of his first roles), Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, and crooner Leif Garrett as the leader of the Socs. They all have rather small roles not really giving them the opportunity to flex any real acting ability but they certainly add to the cast in a great way. Each one of them create a unique character in the small roles they are given.The Outsiders is a brilliant coming of age movie set in the sixties to the perfect (if not overtly predictable) soundtrack. The film, although geared towards teens is a violent look at hatred and stereotyping that ends up in the loss of dear friends. The climax of the film is the brutal fist fight battle between the Socs and the Greasers which although violent is a victory for the constantly harassed ""lower classes"" of the film, the underdogs so to speak. Coppola brilliantly created this world around them and in essence created a classic film that classrooms and people will watch for years to come. If you love eighties films or even just a real powerful drama The Outsiders is worth seeing. If for no other reason than it's fun to see all the big names in their youngest days. 9/10",The Outsiders
26,g-bodyl,Better Than I Expected!,8,8 January 2014,"I never thought The Outsiders would be a good film because it just didn't seem good. Apparently the critics thought the same way when originally released. But however, this film is better than I anticipated and joins the ranks of teen films I enjoy. This film kind of produces a social/political commentary, but I liked how Francis Ford Coppola didn't bring the political stuff to the forefront of the film.Coppola's film is essentially about a battle between two rival gangs: the greasers and the socs. After two of the young greasers fatally stabbed a soc, tensions amount between the two gangs setting up a wild chain of events.The acting is actually pretty good. This film has plenty of young stars before they became big such as Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Ralph Macchio, and C. Thomas Howell. They all acted well with each other and they made emotional connections with their characters hence they made me believe in their characters.Overall, this is a really good teen film that we may or may not be able to connect with. There are some tense scenes as well as a few emotional ones. The story seemed a bit hard to follow at first, but I grew accustomed to it as the movie progressed. This is a rather good, social commentary to watch. I rate this film 8/10.",The Outsiders

It clearly states us on what it was like during the 1960s when poverty and rich didn't get on with each other. It reminds me of how Catholics and protestants didn't come to agreement with each other during the troubles in Northern Ireland. All of this fighting was just completely nonsense and pointless.I think it wasn't Johnny's fault for killing one of the socs because they really were crazy for trying to drown him. Jesus, all they cared about was the looks and not the personality! I would worry more of the personality then the looks.It was too bad Johnny died from burns trying to save the children in the old church building which was himself and ponies hideout. Why the hell were people there especially children? That gave me goosebumps and confusion! It didn't give us a chance to know what really happened! It was also too bad Dallas had to die from the police as he was going mental! It was pretty much the loss of Johnny that triggered him to become angry. I really thought Matt Dillon looked gorgeous during his youth, he looks so much like James Franco! Cherry probably should've taken him regardless if he was acting like a dope. However, he still was a cutie back then regardless hahaha! Good film but some scenes are tear jerking!",The Outsiders

30,Captain_Couth,Stay gold Ponyboy. The Outsiders (The complete novel) review.,8,15 October 2009,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Outsiders is a melodramatic film based upon the novel written by S. E. Hinton (who also as a small role as a nurse). Like many middle school students I was forced to read the novel (which I thought was sappy and cheesy). Coppola's version is pretty much the same as the novel and he did a very good job of capturing the spirit of the film (perhaps too much). Filmed on location in Oklahoma. The actors in this film were a cast of unknowns. But afterwords many of them would go on to become stars (Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon) others would find success in the later years (Diane Lane, Rob Lowe) and some would score some big roles early int their careers and fade away to straight-to-video obscurity (C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez and Patrick Swayze).Ponyboy Curtis is a ""Greaser"" a kid from across the tracks. He's always has his head in the clouds and unlike the other ""Greasers"", he seems to have a bright future if he would stick in head in books instead of hanging out with his buddies Johnny (Ralph Macchio), Two-Bit (Emilio Estevez) and Dallas (Matt Dillon). Pony's brothers Sodapop dropped out of school to work at a local DX with fellow ""Greaser"" Steve (Tom Cruise) whilst older brother Darrel (Patrick Swayze) has to take care of the family since the tragic deaths of their parents. Darrel is under a lot of stress of having to take care of Darrel and Ponyboy that he takes it out on Pony by riding him like a donkey and always jumping on his case. One night after staying out late, Pony and Darrel get into a scuffle causing Pony to runaway from home with Johnny. The ""greasers"" are always in a constant state of war with the rich kids called ""The Socs"". Two members of the group Bob (Leif Garrett) and Randy (Darren Dalton) nearly come to blows with Ponyboy, Two-Bit and Johnny earlier at the drive-in but their girlfriends Cherry (Diane Lane) and Marcia manage to calm down the situation. Hours have passed since the confrontation but their still angry about their tiff with ""The Greasers"" and drive around drinking all night looking for trouble. They spot the two runaways and decide to continue the spat with some additional extracurricular activities. Will Johnny and Ponyboy be able to get out of this pickle? Why do the ""Socs and ""Greasers"" hate each other? Is their any way to end this dispute before things get really out of hand?An entertaining film from Coppola. His daughter has a small part (credited as Domino) and his nephew Nicolas (Coppola) Cage has a role as an extra (his Uncle turned him down for the role of Dallas). If you enjoyed the book then you'll want to get a copy of the Complete Novel version. This cut has additional scenes, new music (Most of the sappy and over dramatic music composed by Carmine Coppola has been replaced with 50's and 60's pop music) and an ending that's more faithful to the novel. Is it melodramatic? Yes, Is it sappy? Yes, even though it's laid on real heavy at times but it's still a good movie that will entertain you.Recommended.",The Outsiders
31,BeneCumb,"Perhaps great then, but currently timeworn",6,30 July 2013,"Since James Dean and Marlon Brando, youngsters with ""cool"" look, tough childhood/surroundings and gang affiliation have attracted millions of viewers all around the globe.

The only exception is C. Thomas Howell as Ponyboy Curtis (who garnered a Young Artist Award), who has confined himself to smaller roles later on.The amount of future stars is probably the biggest value of the movie; the plot is trivial and predictable, most characters too black-and-white, alternation of scenes is friable, romantic and pondering scenes do not provide additional value to the movie...From the 1980ies, for example, most related movies with the participation of River Phoenix and Matt Dillon are much more catchy.",The Outsiders
32,Lechuguilla,The Insiders,3,13 November 2011,"""The Outsiders"" is what you get when a high-octane Hollywood director tries to make a movie about ""outsiders"", from an insider point of view. The story is set in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Yet, Hollywood-Coppola hires Michigan-born Stevie Wonder to sing a nondescript song that in no way relates either to the Oklahoma setting or even to the story's time period of the 1950s. Several times Coppola inserts a pop song called ""Gloria"" (G-L-O-R-I-A), recorded in 1964, years after the word ""greasers"" was in style. Coppola further hires a cast of actors, no fewer than five of which are from the state of New York ... so much for authenticity.Maybe the novel by Hinton, on which the script was based, is good. But this Hollywood-insider film is not. The story plots the conflict between the high school age ""so-ches"" (short for the wealthy, high society crowd) from the good side of town, vs. the ""greasers"" from across the tracks. But the too-talky, us-vs-them script fails to develop the characters, hardly surprising, given how many of them there are. Quite aside from poor casting, neither the Emilio Estevez character nor the Tom Cruise character is needed.Though the characters' ages generally are late teens to early twenties, their dialogue suggests people thirty years older. ""There's still lots of good in the world. Tell (that) to ... I don't think he knows"", says one overly mature teen to another.The plot is highly contrived, as evidenced by the big ""rumble"" sequence, clearly staged and choreographed as if it were a cowboys and Indians shoot-out from some John Ford western.Much of the plot and acting are overly melodramatic and hokey, with some characters practically begging for sympathy from teary-eyed young female viewers who are expected to fawn over the youthful, photogenic male cast.The only saving element to this film is the cinematography. Though the film is in color, the hues are highly subdued, and thus convey a romanticized and nostalgic tone. And some of the camera framing is quite artistic. I think the visuals work well from the POV of the lead character. On the other hand, a lot of scenes take place at night, and the corresponding use of camera filters is obvious.Francis Ford Coppola is a talented and well-respected director. But his Hollywood-insider POV proves counter-productive when trying to make a film about 1950s youthful social outcasts in Tulsa, Oklahoma.",The Outsiders
33,davispittman,Don't see the love for it,4,19 November 2017,"I just don't see the great love some people have for this movie. The Outsiders (1983) is a film by Francis Ford Coppola, based off the novel of the same name. The story is set in the 1950s, and it stars a lot of the big time youth stars in Hollywood at that time. The cast includes Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze, and Diane Lane. The film's plot relies a lot on the acting from the cast, it's a lot of heavy dialogue between the characters. And of course there is nothing wrong with a film relying a good bit on the actors and their talent, but I feel like this film relied so much on it that the actual story suffered. The rich and poor, the preppy kids and the greaser kids, the differences in social class plays a big role in the plot. It's ultimately what gives us a movie, it's because of that and the horrible consequences that come about from that, that we even have a book and movie. I will commend the acting from all the cast members, the performances given were very good and that's why the rating is as high as it is. To be completely honest, the acting is really the only part of this film that I actually liked. I feel like the actual plot was weak and the filmmakers didn't do enough to make me care about what happened. Many times throughout the movie, I found myself bored and wondering when it was going to end. I just couldn't get involved in the story, couldn't get myself to care about what happened. I think another mistake they made was the pace and the length. Maybe if it was longer, and if they would have filled that time with more interesting things, then I would giving this film a higher rating. I can't recommend The Outsiders because truthfully it's not that great of a film. Yes, many of the performances given were good, but that's it as far as positives go. I felt like I had overall wasted my time by the end of the film. I guess it's not terrible, but it's certainly not good. 4/10 for The Outsiders.",The Outsiders

36,Jonny_Numb,River City Rumblers,6,9 November 2007,"""The Outsiders"" was the Big Novel in my eighth-grade reading class, and it's easy to see why: S.E. Hinton's heavy-handed melodrama of lower-class delinquents (dubbed 'Greasers') and over-privileged rich kids ('Socs') was clearly intended to speak to the class diversity found in the typical high-school classroom; moreover, it emphasized the obvious point that looks can be deceiving. Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film adaptation carries much the same effect as the novel itself, with a nostalgic appearance that makes every scene a postcard-pretty love letter to the early 1960s. And even if the characterizations are a bit choppy, this is an excellent collection of young actors who went on to careers of widely varied success. C. Thomas Howell (3 years away from his best role, in ""The Hitcher"") stands out as Ponyboy Curtis, the literary-minded Greaser who's a romantic at heart; Diane Lane also shines as Ponyboy's potential love interest, a Soc named Cherry Valence. Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, and Rob Lowe lend budding star power to their admittedly sporadic supporting roles. As with the novel, Coppola's film is a rather contrived soapbox that is kept from being a harder-hitting nostalgia piece because the story remains planted in that simplistic, high-school-reading-class world. But it's well worth a look, just for the talent involved.",The Outsiders
37,p-stepien,Rebels Without a Cause,4,1 October 2012,"1960s, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) belongs to a group of juvenile greasers from the low-end of the social stratum. As his parents died he is currently being brought up by his elder brothers Darry (Patrick Swayze) and Soda (Rob Lowe). During a brawl against a bunch of well-off Socs his best friend Johnny ('Karate Kid' Ralph Macchio) uses a switchblade to protect Ponyboy killing a teenager in the process. After consulting with the crass and edgy rude boy of the group Dally (Matt Dillon) they decide to hitch a train and lay low in a derelict church...Francis Ford Coppola indulges in some cheesy experimentation, essentially trying to present the story through the lenses of early cinema. His wife Carmine Coppola dabbles with him inputing some bombastic, overemphasised music to bring back the cinematographic feel of the 1930s - 1950s 'Golden Age' of filmmaking, giving ""The Outsiders"" an almost surrealist feel, at times dangerously bordering on parody. During their brief respite offered by the run-down church the mood of the movie is directly influenced by ""Gone With the Wind"" featuring a background sunrise visibly inspired by some of the most famous scenes from that movie - the dreamlike quality to it unmistakable as the boys find themselves in a state of bliss. Emotions, scenes and music are characterised by naivety, as if to suggest the vision of innocence, 'staying gold' is shown through the mind and eyes of a essential innocence. Albeit the idea was pretty interesting it comes off overly contrived with uneven performances and subsequently underbidding drama.Featuring some minor roles for Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez and Diane Lane it could be stated as being a coming out movie for many actors, unfortunately one that is an artistic misstep by Coppola - probably the first hint to his faltering career and creativity.",The Outsiders
38,gangstahippie,Fairly Overrated And Not As Good As The Book.,8,15 August 2006,"Rated PG-13 for violence,teen drinking and smoking and some sexual references.I used to actually like the Outsiders movie.This was before I read the excellent book then afterwords saw the film in class.The book was great.Great storyline and a very good book overall.One of S.E Hinton's best books.The movie however was not as good.The film had potential.This film was directed by Francis Ford Coppola who directed The Godfather Trilogy and Rumble Fish(another S.E Hinton book).I have two main problems with this movie.First of all the acting is horrible!I don't usually notice bad acting and when I do the acting must be really bad.Some quotes are really corny.Another problem I have with this movie is that the movie is not faithful to the book.The movie is rushed and is missing lots of key scenes.I have not seen the extended version though this is for the original version.The film is about two poor kids who kill a rich kid in self-defense.They hide for a while until they accidentally set fire to a church where a couple of kids are playing.They try to rescue them and become heroes but their friend Johnyy gets brutally burned in the process.The poor kids are the Greasers and the rich kids are called the Socs.The gang decides to have one big battle to settle this rival gang mess.The outsiders was a great book but a not so great movie.Wait for it on TV.Runtime:91min 6/10",The Outsiders
39,bandw,Uneven,6,3 April 2011,"Parts of this movie rang true to me while other parts seemed out of place. Based on the book by S.E. Hinton, the story treads on the familiar territory of group conflicts among teens. There are the Greasers versus the Socs (pronounced ""sohshes""--the social elite) in 1960s Tulsa. Of course we are encouraged to identify with the Greasers as the underdogs, and indeed their lives are hard with parents who are not there, or who are there and don't care about their kids. Among the cast of budding young stars it is C. Thomas Howell (as Ponyboy), Ralph Macchio (as Johnny) and Matt Dillon (as Dallas) who get the most screen time. The setup of the conflict between the two gangs is done well enough with Ponyboy falling for one of the Socs' girls, provoking a jealously-fueled retaliation. This comes while Johnny and Ponyboy are talking in the park one night when a group of Socs shows up and attacks them, resulting in a killing that has Johnny and Ponyboy going on the lam. They wind up at an abandoned church upon the advice of Dallas who is the go-to guy among the Greasers. It is some of the scenes at the church that I found hardest to digest, such as the one that has Ponyboy reciting Robert Frost's ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"" to Johnny while bathed in the amber light of a sunset. Also, Ponyboy reads ""Gone with the Wind"" out loud to Johnny during their stay. Who thought that Greasers could be so sensitive. To disguise themselves Ponyboy and Johnny decide to cut off their hair and this amounts to clipping a few strands--I suppose the director did not want to lose the attractiveness of the two handsome young actors. Another hokey scene has Johnny and Ponyboy rescuing some children from a burning building. Just in case self defense would not get them off, best to make them heroes.No surprise that the climactic scene is a rumble between the two gangs. One scene that struck me as truthful was between one of the Socs and Ponyboy that had the Soc saying that no matter if the Greasers won the rumble, they would still be on the bottom of the heap, still losers in society.This movie has some personal significance to me since I graduated from the same Tulsa high school a few years before Hinton wrote her book while in school there. It was good to see some of the old Tulsa landmarks in the film like the Bowen Lounge and the Admiral Twin drive-in that had back-to-back screens. When I was at the school it was pretty much all kids from middle-class families. I don't recall there being even a hint of the type of thing that was portrayed in the movie. Either I was moving in different circles, things changed, or Hinton has a good imagination.Interesting cast in an over-scripted film.",The Outsiders
40,Screen_Blitz,Well worth adaption of the classic novel by S.E Hinton,7,7 March 2016,"Francis Ford Coppola is widely known as the mastermind behind some of the most influential films in the history of cinema including 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Godfather', and its sequel. With such significantly outstanding works like these on his resume, it can be difficult to believe he stepped into the coming-of-age drama. But his attempts at working with the genre were proved with positivity when he came to directed this coming-of-age drama based on the classic novel by S.E Hinton. Set in 1966 Tulsa, Oklahoma, this film tells the story of two rivaling social groups: The Socs, the rich people who live in nice houses and drive fancy cars, and the greasers, the poor ones with greasy hair, growing up in lower class families. Ponyboy Curtis (played by C. Thomas Howell), a greaser living with his older brother Sodapop (played by Rob Lowe) and his uptight older brother Daryl (played by Patrick Swayze). Along his side is his best friend Johnny (played by Ralph Macchio), and his two friends Steve (played by Tom Cruise), Two-Bit (played by Emilio Estevez), and the toughest guy in the gang Dallas (played by Matt Dillon). These teenagers have been at odds against the Socs, and have engaged in violent confrontations between each other, particularly Johnny was once jumped by a group of Socs. However, one night when Johnny murders a Soc who tries to kill Ponyboy, the tensions between the two groups reach a boiling point.This film based on the novel of the same name provides plenty of commentary to the 50s and 60s social subculture through the story of two rivaling groups in a crime-ridden town. With a moody blues rock soundtrack including the song 'Gloria' by Them and the old classic custom-built cars, the film captures a nostalgic resemblance of the 1960s southern environment. But most importantly, director Francis Ford Coppola manages to capture the powerful portrayal of teen angst and the feeling of not being able to fit in. With the brilliantly written story and characters, the film transcends through an emotional powerhouse that both touches the hearts of audiences and provides a sense of hope. The characters come on screen so beautifully and the audience can engage with just about every one, they are so difficult not to care, especially Johnny and Ponyboy who are pummeled many challenges including domestic disputes and tragedy. The film remains mostly faithful to S.E Hinton's novel while taking just a minimal amount of liberties, but the biggest flaw comes from the exclusion of some the novel's key scenes and the results is some scenes that feel somewhat short of significance. Fortunately, this fault is made up in the Complete Novel Edition on DVD which includes the rest of the important scenes left out from the original. The cast is pretty solid, the performances are great; especially Matt Dillon who plays Dallas with sheer conviction. The Outsiders is well worth achievement by Francis Ford Coppola and the great adaption to S.E Hinton's novel. Definitely one of the best coming-of-age films Hollywood has to offer. Although the original version is good, I strongly recommend watching the Complete Novel Edition set with additional scenes and alternate soundtrack as it stays more true to the novel.",The Outsiders
41,KUAlum26,A little over the top but...,9,4 December 2006,"...still a very satisfying film.Francis Ford Coppola's treatment of S.E.Hinton's novel is something of a revelation:a forthright adventure/drama with the main cast consisting almost entirely of actors under the age of twenty-one,the exception being Patrick Swayze,who was a ripe old twenty-nine when filming began! It was also a fairly intimate,un-ironic and sincere treatment of the bonding that occurs between young boys about to become men,which is something that you will RARELY if ever find now.The hero of this film(for the most part)is one Ponyboy Curtis(C.Thomas Howell,asked to put in acting at the tender age of fourteen that some adult actors can't pull off!),a junior-high schooler who belongs with the ""Greasers"",the guys from the ""wrong side of the tracks"" named for the grease and goop they put in their hair. (The year or years when this film is taking place isn't specific,but I've deduced it's probably around 1960,and the fifties and all the Eisenhower-era social class vestiges are quite in place here.) His best buds are one Johnny Cade(Ralph Macchio,pre-Karate Kid and not quite fully testosteronal yet),a scared kid whose parents drink and fight,and Dallas""Dally""Winston(Matt Dillon,hyper-conductive as the rebel),a prison-scarred outcast with quite the temper. As per always,the Greasers are in conflict with the ""Socs""(pronounced SOshes),the rich kids in town,and the Socs don't seem to be above picking on the perceived weakest members of the Greasers. When Ponyboy and Johnny are spotted in the company of pretty,soft-spoken Soc Cherry Valence(Diane Lane,as beautiful then as now),a group of them decide they'll pick on Ponyboy and Johnny. When the Socs corner Pony and Johnny on a playground,some tragic consequences arise.From there,Ponyboy and Johnny go on the run and then go on a journey of discovery. No longer able to really be kids,not mature enough to be considered fully adult,they are wrestling with guilt over killing the Soc and their general lots in life. Little do they know it,but soon,fate will have a hand in changing them still.This is quite an ensemble cast. One could almost look at this film as,if nothing else,a snapshot of future Hollywood: Swayze(as the parent figure of Ponyboy and his brother Sodapop),Rob Lowe(as Sodapop),Emilio Estevez(hilarious as the screwy Two-bit),Lane,Dillon,Macchio,Sofia Coppola(in a quick cameo) and some guy named Tom Cruise would all go on to much bigger stuff on the big screen. But I feel like it's more than that. With images that are both original and homages(Gone With The Wind,in particular)to past movies,Mr.Coppola is able to create something that is as real as if it happened to you or someone you know,and yet make it into a surreal sense of yesteryear and innocence.Excellent use of both score and pop tunes of the era(predominantly Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis music). I'd heard about this film for quite a while but never quite got why it touched so many. After finally getting around to really watching it(I'd caught glimpses of it many,many,many moons ago on HBO and wasn't really blown away by it),I can understand why. The lines and the emoting in this film are pretty close to being hammy at times,and the volume of characters crammed in here suggests that there may have been more to this novel than the movie allowed for,but I suppose that may be unavoidable. As is,it's quite the movie for those who are nostalgic for movies about coming-of-age that don't treat adolescence or its near approach as being merely a set-up for shameless hormonalizing or jacked-up violence. Worth a rent,particularly on DVD for the extras.",The Outsiders
42,bobsgrock,Battle of Novel vs Movie.,7,23 November 2009,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Outsiders is a good adaptation of a very effective novel. What bothers me is that with the story and cast it could have been great. Here, the source material is SC Hinton's book about teen angst and class differences in rural Oklahoma. The 'Greasers' and the 'Socs' are from opposite sides of the track. Neither likes the other and will come rushing to the aid of anyone that is part of their clique.One of the problems I saw was that the story is only told from the Greasers's point of view. The Socs are always viewed as vicious and despicable spoiled kids who misunderstand the heart of gold of some of the Greasers, particularly Ponyboy (C. Thomas Howell) and Johnny (Ralph Macchio). It's unfortunate for this because it could have been a much more complex and meaningful story had we understood both sides of the tension. To make matters worse, this cast, which consists of some of the biggest names of the 1980s, have very little to do. The story centers around Howell and Macchio but they don't seem to be able to carry the story too well. I like Matt Dillon as the juvenile delinquent Dallas Winston, but he is underused. The same can be said for Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise. All are great actors but are forced to stay in the shadows and waste their talent simply by looking tough and dirty.Coppola is a great director, but I think he is limited by the screenplay here. He apparently is so faithful to the book that the translation to the cinema lacks the emotional tug necessary for this type of story. The film has a great look and the climactic scenes are well-shot and effective, but the ending is unlikely to stay with you after it is done and leaves you wanting more. At a brief 91 minutes, there is so much more to be said. Too bad it is left undeveloped.",The Outsiders

46,Beta_Gallinger,"Not the stunning adaptation it could have been, but not a bad one",7,23 September 2007,"I studied the 1967 novel, ""The Outsiders"", by S.E. Hinton, back in middle school. It has been years since then, but it's a very powerful story, and rather hard to forget! I was shown this movie a couple years later, in my first high school English class. I can't remember exactly what I thought at the time (I guess I thought it was so-so), but I have seen it twice since then, and can't say it reached its full potential, but overall, it's still a reasonable adaptation.Ponyboy Curtis and Johnny Cade are two teenagers who are members of the ""greaser"" gang. Their rivals are the ""socs"". One night, Ponyboy and Johnny fall asleep in a vacant lot. When they wake up, it is still dark, and they are clueless as to what time it is. Ponyboy goes home, where his eldest brother, Darry (who has looked after his two younger brothers, Ponyboy and Sodapop, since their parents' tragic death), has been worrying about his absence. Darry ends up hitting Ponyboy, and although he then says he didn't mean it, Ponyboy runs away. Pony wakes up Johnny, who is still in the lot, and they go to the park. Unfortunately, they are attacked by a group of Socs, who nearly drown Ponyboy, but Johnny comes to the rescue by killing one of them, and causing the others to run off! To try and avoid arrest, the two leave town, after getting directions from fellow greaser Dallas ""Dally"" Winston, who tells them to go to an abandoned church in Windrixville. What does the future hold for these two?! One problem with this movie is that some scenes seem a bit rushed, such as the scene where Darry hits Ponyboy and he runs away. Also, the acting isn't that great, at least not from C. Thomas Howell (who plays Ponyboy) and Ralph Macchio (who plays Johnny). Mainly for those two reasons, some parts of the film are not as gripping as they should be. Fortunately, this adaptation of ""The Outsiders"" also has its merits. It's a faithful adaptation (it probably helped that S.E. Hinton was a consultant), despite not including certain parts of the book, which some would be disappointed by. It also includes at least some of the tension and poignancy from the book, and gets more gripping towards the end.Overall, Francis Ford Coppola and Kathleen Rowell did a good job bringing S.E. Hinton's highly acclaimed story to the motion picture format. Far from a perfect job, but a good one nonetheless. For those who have been blown away by the book, I wouldn't expect this movie to be all you could possibly hope for, or else you could easily end up sorely disappointed. However, if you watch the film with moderate expectations, it will probably have a better chance of pleasing you, at least to a certain extent.",The Outsiders
47,gab-14712,"Interesting, But Could Have Been Better!",8,31 August 2019,"Francis Ford Coppola is the visionary director who brought The Godfather films and Apocalypse Now to the big screen and he really made a name for himself directing these classics. After watching these films, I was very interested in what Coppola directed next. That film happened to be 1983's The Outsiders. After watching this film, I thought it was.... merely fine. It was an interesting enough movie, but Coppola's direction is actually one of the film's biggest culprits. He really brought style to the movie in terms of lighting and the overall look, but he could have paid more attention to his characters. These characters were paper-thin and some of the dialogue was a bit sketchy. It was interesting to see what Coppola could do by tackling the theme of teen angst. I just wish he brought more life to the story.Coppola and screenwriter adapted this story from S.E Hinton's famous novel-one that was written when the author was sixteen years old. Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) is the youngest of three siblings. He lives with the eldest child, Darrell (Patrick Swayze) and the middle child, Sodapop (Rob Lowe). Their parents are deceased and the relationship between the children is muddled at best. These kids belong a gang called the Greasers, a working-class gang from the north side of town. Ponyboy, with his sensitive nature, believes the actions of this gang will split their family up-especially with the gang leader, Dallas Winston (Matt Dillon). The Greasers's main rivals are the Socs-a gang of super rich kids from the south of town. These gangs are pitted against one another when a connection is formed between Ponyboy and a girlfriend of one of the Soc's members, Cherry Valance (Diane Lane). This doesn't sit well and lives of people from both sides may be threatened.I'm amazed by this cast. Mostly big names here, but they were not big at the time of the movie's release. Many of these names would go on to have long and big careers. (Swayze, Lane, Dillon, and yes even Tom Cruise is here). It's ironic that the lead actor, C. Thomas Howell would be the least popular actor here. It's a shame because I thought he delivered a nice performance despite the way the character was written. Same goes for Ralph Macchio-who played Ponyboy's friend, Johnny. Although the characters were not written well enough, there were nothing wrong with these portrayals. Matt Dillon kind of reminds me of his My Bodyguard performance here. Patrick Swayze was also very good here.I do like the themes the movie tries to bring across. I never read the source material, so it's hard to say how well the film was adapted. But realism is a key factor. Through a new perspective, Coppola wanted to show how tough growing up without loved ones aka parents could be. In that regard, he did succeed. Many of the characters we come to know or even sympathize with here grew up without family, thus making their actions more believable. I definitely look towards Matt Dillon's character this way. These characters were a bit romanticized, but definitely believable.The cracks do begin to show in Coppola's direction. His staging techniques were.... interesting. He does bring a playful style to the mix. The visuals were certainly captivating and I liked in the director's cut of the film, he added 60's music. The song ""Gloria"" is used to full effect in the movie. The performances were really good and they were a nice introduction for the actors' future works, for the most part. The film can be slow at times and the dialogue is a little corny, but watching these ""bad boys"" grow up can be an interesting and memorable watch.My Grade: B-",The Outsiders
48,gelman@attglobal.net,POSSIBLE SPOILERS: If you like Francis Ford Coppola.....,4,10 September 2008,"...(and I do not) you will probably like this film. It offers a number of future stars in small roles -- Matt Dillon and Patrick Swayze have the largest, Diane Lane has a meaty part, Tom Cruise is a distinctly minor character -- but it bears all the hallmarks, good and bad, of Coppola's style. Since this film came after the Godfather movies, what it displays most to me is Coppola's self-indulgence. Already a Great Man in Hollywood, Coppola could get away with anything. It's not that the plot is bad: a similar conflict between gangs from different sides of the track became ""West Side Story."" The conflict here between ""the Greasers"" and ""the Socs"" (pronounced soshes)tracks other tales of high school gang conflict, enhanced by Diane Lane in the well-done but wholly improbable role of a ""soc"" girl hanging out with a ""greaser"" guy at an outdoor movie. It is that temporary connection that sparks the fight and killing which is at the center of the drama (such as it is). I won't recite the rest of the story, not because I might spoil it for others, but because it bored me in the watching and would bore me again in the telling.",The Outsiders
49,EijnarAmadeus,Highly stylized homage to 1950s teenage problematics.,5,28 October 2009,"A starstruck cast do what they can to make this teenage drama powerful and relevant, but it's hard to connect as director Francis Coppola goes overload with his highly stylized visuals. The acting chops of youngsters C. Thomas Howell and Ralph Macchio are given the heavy duty to carry the weight of the film as two sadly troubled, teenage boys that's found solace and security in each others company. The film heavily leans on the pompous score by Carmine Coppola when supposed to drive the emotional chord home, combined with shifty editing and strange visual effects, and struggles to be as compelling as it wants to be. But nevertheless, there's more to like than dislike; the cast is good (though Matt Dillon proves himself the weakest around), there's tacky but effective dialogs, and though Coppola makes a mess of it visually sometimes, the story is fairly simple and easy to follow. THE OUTSIDERS ain't no hidden treasure in Coppola's canon of work, but it's got some great moments and tells a fairly good story about friendship, adolescence, family and the many responsibilities of life, and off course, there's some fun in watching the rising stars establish their careers.",The Outsiders

I thought esteemed director Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now) did a fairly competent job of adapting the book (there will always be somerevisions and omissions in such an enterprise). He preserved the essence of the class struggle: the eternal conflict between those who were better favored by birth and station (Socs) with those less favored (Greasers).

The movie is NEVER as good as the book, but one movie that comes pretty damn close is THE OUTSIDERS, the 1983 film version of a book by S.E. Hunton I first read as a teenager. This teen classic is sort of a non-musical variation of WEST SIDE STORY, where we find a class division in 1950's Oklahoma between two groups of restless teens: the Greasers, the poor kids from the wrong side of the tracks and the more socially acceptable Socs...the rich kids with the fancy cars and clothes and wouldn't be seen being friendly with a Greaser. The crux of the story revolves around two Greasers, one named PonyBoy (C. Thomas Howell) and his best friend, Johnny (Ralph Macchio) who are forced on the run after being jumped one night and their escape involves a murder. Howell and Macchio play their roles with sincerity and have a solid cast of up and coming stars behind them here: Patrick Swayze and Rob Lowe play Ponyboy's brothers, Darry and Sodapop, who have completely different relationships with Ponyboy. Matt Dillon is charismatic as Dallas Winston, the unofficial leader of the Greasers and Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise are also featured as fellow greasers Two-Bit and Steve. For those who read the book growing up, be assured this film will not disappoint. It might not be quite as effective if you never read the book, but it's still a moving variation on the teen angst dramas that populated movie screens in the 80's.",The Outsiders

56,jcbutthead86,A Brilliant Classic With An Amazing Cast. Francis Coppola At His Best.,10,8 March 2013,"Francis Coppola's The Outsiders is classic,one of the best Teen Films,Coming Of Age films and Gang films ever made. Filled with great direction,one of the best casts in film history and a excellent score, this is one of my favorite movies and is one of Coppola's best films.Based on S.E Hinton's novel of the same name and set in Tulsa,Oklahoma in 1965,The Outsiders tells the story about a group of Greasers,poor,working class kids who are fighting to protect their turf from The Socs,a bunch of rich kids who beat up and terrorize Greasers. Among The Greasers is a young man named Ponyboy Curtis(C.Thomas Howell)who while hanging with his best friend Johnny Cade(Ralph Macchio)are attacked by The Socs. When Johnny kills one of The Socs,Ponyboy and Johnny confide with their friend and fellow Greaser Dallas Winston(Matt Dillon). After the murder,a set of tragic events happen building up to a big rumble between The Greasers and The Socs.One of The reasons The Outsiders is a great film is because of the way Francis Coppola approaches the material. Adapting a beloved,classic book is never easy,but Coppola adapts S.E Hinton's classic so easily and does it without a hitch. Coppola has always said that this was an epic for teens or a Gone With The Wind for teenagers and while Coppola doesn't match the epic quality of Gone With The Wind in terms of length or story,it's like GWTW in terms of scope and style. The film takes the civil war concept of GWTW and instead of North vs South,it's Greasers vs Socs,giving viewers a harsh reality where Greasers are constantly being attacked by Socs and always have to defend themselves. It's a civil war in the mid-1960's with switchblades instead of guns. The film is also epic in terms of it's beautiful widescreen cinematography by Stephen H.Burum. Burum's cinematography is stylish and unforgettable and reminds viewers of classic Hollywood films like Rebel Without A Cause,East Of Eden and West Side Story using colors like orange,gold and blue giving the film a great atmosphere. Some shots are also similar to Gone With The Wind with shots of the sunrise and sunset with beautiful gold and orange scenery. The Outsiders is gorgeous to look at. The Greasers in the film like Ponyboy and his friends are just regular teens and young adults trying to find their way in the world and while they're in gangs and into rumbles they're likable people. I think what Coppola's film and Hinton's novel was trying to say was that there was a world outside of gangs,Greasers,Socs and rumbles,where Ponyboy and his friends can rise above being a greaser and labels,because while Ponyboy and his friends are into gang activity they're not criminals thugs or troublemakers. The Outsiders is one of the most faithful book to movie translations I have ever seen,pretty much most of the scenes and dialog are lifted right from the book with a few alterations. You can read the book or watch the film at the same time and see for yourself. The ending of the film is sad,but at the same time hopeful and will stay with you and makes the film and book a timeless classic. While I love the theatrical version of the film,I also liked the complete novel extended director's cut of the film with some scenes that were deleted from the final film. We get more scenes with Ponyboy and his older brothers and also other scenes that were from the book that enhance the plot in the film. But if there is one problem I have with the director's cut of the film it's exclusion of Carmine Coppola's score which has been taken out completely. I love Carmine Coppola's score for the film and for me the score is one of the things I love about The Outsiders and watch the film without the score is eating one of your favorite foods with a missing ingredient. A film score is something that can make or break a film and Carmine's score is one of the things that makes the film. Francis Coppola should not have had the original score taken out. Other than that I liked the Complete novel version.The whole cast does an amazing job in their roles. C.Thomas Howell is excellent in his career defining role as Ponyboy Curtis,with Howell bringing depth,sadness and intensity to the role. Matt Dillon is brilliant as Dallas Winston,a greaser who is tough,but cares about his fellow Greasers. Ralph Macchio is terrific as Johnny Cade,an abused kid who is Ponyboy's best friend. Patrick Swayze and Rob Lowe give great performances as Darrell and Sodapop Curtis,Ponyboy's older brothers. Emilio Estevez is wonderful as Two-Bit Matthews,with Estevez bringing humor to the role. Tom Cruise gives a fine performance as Steve Randle,Sodapop's best friend. Who would have known Cruise would be a big star. Diane Lane gives a great performance and is beautiful as Cherry Valance,a Soc that befriends Ponyboy. Leif Garrett is good as Bob,a Soc who's Cherry's boyfriend. Glenn Withrow(Tim Shepard),Darren Dalton(Randy),Michelle Meyrink(Marcia),Tom Waits(Buck),Gailard Sartain(Jerry) and William Smith(Store Clerk)give good performances as well. This film had one best casts in movie history.The direction Francis Coppola is excellent,with Coppola bringing a beautiful visual style and great camera angles giving the film a great atmosphere. Great direction by Coppola.The score by Carmine Coppola is excellent,epic and beautiful and fits in with the film's visuals and tone. It's a great score that Francis should not have taken out. I also loved the classic Stevie Wonder song Stay Gold which is beautiful and memorable. There's also a great use of the Van Morrison classic Gloria.In final word,if you love Teen films,Coming Of Age films,Gang films,films in general,Francis Coppola and S.E Hinton I suggest you see The Outsiders,an absolute classic that will stay with you forever. Highly Recommended. Theatrical Version:10/10. Complete Novel Version:8.5/10.",The Outsiders
57,TheHonestCritic,This is one of the best book-to-screen adaptations in the history of cinema.,10,13 September 2019,"""The Outsiders"" (1983) is nothing short of a masterpiece, it's one of the best book-to-screen adaptations in the history of film. One of the biggest reasons that this movie came out as phenomenal as it did, is because the author S.E. Hinton supervised the actual film production of the movie! The filming took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma; which is where the story takes place. Also, that is where S.E. Hinton lives! That should be a given when filming movies based on novels, have the author(s) supervise the film production and give input. That way, their original vision would truly come to the screen! ""The Outsiders"" movie fires on all cylinders. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack. This movie follows the original book story flawlessly, and reading this book and watching this film is certainly a life-changing experience. The cast is one of the most iconic in cinematic history. It stars: C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, and many more. Even S.E. Hinton has a cameo appearance as one of the nurses in the film! Every cast member is utilized to their full potential and perform their characters perfectly. What a phenomenal cast! Back then, most of the actors/actresses were unknown, but they soon evolved into the mega stars we know today! ""The Outsiders"" is a cinematic marvel, and one of the best dramas. I can watch this movie over and over and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. One thing to look out for when you buy the DVD, make sure the cover says: ""The Outsiders"" The Complete Novel. The original theatrical version has several crucial scenes cut. But the DVD that says ""The Complete Novel"" under the title includes the full uncut version, and that's the one you need to get. If you have not seen ""The Outsiders"" go watch it, prepare to be mind-blown!",The Outsiders

My daughter begged me to watch the movie so i agreed out of love for her, i really didn't want to watch this movie. Well we sat down put it in and OMG in heaven, this had to be one of the gayest movies i have ever seen in my life. My daughter said a woman wrote the book. It was so fun to watch, i laughed so hard at all the gay innuendos. When my daughter began to catch on why i was laughing, she said a lot of the boys in her class were also laughing. This is one of those movies where you can prove to people that these big stars really cannot act. But i would give it a ten. LOL grab a few beers watch it and laugh your butt off.",The Outsiders
59,cinephile-27690,A Thoroughly Entertaining Coppola Movie!,10,14 October 2018,"My Mom gave me the book to this when I was 14. She told me that she read the book when she was my age and the author was about my age when she wrote it. Well, I started reading it and was enthralled with it. However, I was unable to finish the book for a personal reason that is off topic.I had heard of a film adaptation of it much later and I saw most of it, but I slept through the middle.(Not from boredom, just from feeling tired.)Today is Sunday, and I bought a DVD of it from my cousin on Friday. I watched it last night and I was breath taken by how great it was.The movie follows a gang who get in trouble with a self-defense murder. (Self-defense is of course legal if proven, but since they are gang members, the police wants them). After hiding, the gang become heroes.One impressive thing about the movie is the cast, Most of them are young 80s stars-including:Matt Dillon(There's Something About Mary), Patrick Swayze(Dirty Dancing), Rob Lowe(Austin Powers co-star), Tom Cruise(Rain Man, Mission Impossible, and much more), Ralph Macchio(The Karate Kid), and many more stars. In female leads, Diane Lane plays Cherry.The movie is very exciting as well. I know when a movie is one of my favorites if I feel a thrill in my chest. The Outsiders did this nearly the entire time, right from the first scene.The director is Francis Ford Coppola, most known for directing The Godfather Trilogy and Apocalypse Now. While those movies may be greater, I personally think that this is Coppola's best work. (By the way, his daughter Sofia is the girl at Diary Queen who asks the gang for spare change. She was also the baptized baby in The Godfather.)I also want to make note of this to parents: the movie is rated PG, but it's one of those movies that would be PG-13 today. There is violence/murder as I mentioned, and there is also cursing(SOB is the worst). I would suggest 10 and up at youngest to see this movie.But when you can, this is definitely a movie you should see. Better yet, read the book. (That's something I don't say often).This is one of the very best movies I have ever seen and I know that you will adore it too!",The Outsiders
60,Aly200,"Tragic, Touching and Well Acted",9,2 August 2012,"S.E. Hinton's classic teen novel is brought to the big screen by famed director, Francis Ford Coppola, with an all star cast of the 1980s biggest teenage stars. The film's premise centers around two rival gangs in rural Oklahoma, the Socs (the town's upper-crust kids) and the Greasers (the lower-class kids), locked in an endless gang war over their town's turf. When two young Greasers, Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) and Johnny Cade (a pre-""Karate Kid"" Ralph Macchio) become tied up in the slaying of one Soc member, the kids go on the run. Soon enough they are embroiled in one last battle that culminate in tragedy that does contain a silver lining by the film's final lines. The film's cast is hand-picked expertly particularity in Howell and Macchio as Ponyboy and Johnny. Howell brings a virginal maturity to Ponyboy, the youngest in a family of three (the death of the Curtis parents are mentioned frequently in the film). He wants to be taken seriously, but feels restrained by both his small town and his eldest brother's (Patrick Swayze) overprotective nature. As for Macchio, he brings a frightened shyness to Johnny Cade; a child traumatized by his abusive home-life and being frequently jumped by the Socs. However his heroism in the film's church scene boost Johnny's mentality as stronger than he let on, but maintains a vulnerability of his own that differs from C. Thomas Howell's style.The supporting cast bolsters the ""big name"" roster of teen idols such as Patrick Swayze as Darrell ""Darry"" Curtis, Ponyboy's eldest brother who wants to do right by his two younger brothers to keep them in his custody, Rob Lowe is the middle brother, Sodapop or Soda, the joker of the family but also protective of his older and younger brother, Matt Dillon is the hot- headed and sleazy Dallas ""Dally"" Winston who is close to Johnny Cade, Emilio Estevez (just before the ""Brat Pack"" started) as Two-Bit Matthews and a rising superstar named Tom Cruise is Steve Randall. Notable as the sole standout female is Diane Lane as Sherry ""Cherry (due to her red hair)"" Valance.This is a movie that won't leave you with a dry eye. Keep the tissue box nearby and be ready to cry.",The Outsiders
61,foxtografo,"Fun sometimes, poor overall",4,28 September 2020,"I didn't know this movie until now, so I guess I don't have the love some others have for it having watched it back in the day, the nostalgia part doesn't play on me.
I found very interesting the casting, most of the actors went to be big in cinema, so it's fun to see them all together when they were just starting.
The story was fun to watch too, but the acting get more and more in the way of fun as it becomes more and more cheesy and just plain bad.
The story it's very inconsistent and dramatism is given randomly some times, and it's missing in others.
The music is poorly paced in my opinion, it's not that doesn't fit the movie, but some scenes are jut a total miss musically.
As it was common in most of the movies on the 80s and 90s, the choreography in fights and scenes of violence were pretty ridiculous, which wouldn't ruin the movie for me on it's own, but here it only added up something else I didn't like.
I felt the last half hour was quite rushed and the worst in terms of acting and pace on the story, I was wishing it ends for the last about 20 minutes.
I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie at all, but it really went down the hill the second half.
It's a curious rare casting thing to watch, but definitely not a great movie, calling it a classic it's just out of nostalgia.",The Outsiders
62,lovettstough,Great Movie! Classic!,10,12 November 2018,This is a great classic movie. Great plot and story line. I had to read the book and watch the movie when I was in school. I personally really connected with this movie because I grew up in foster care so even though I wasn't one of the cool outsiders like the guys in this movie were I was very much an outsider and got picked on a lot. I think a lot of people can personally connect with the story of this movie and book.,The Outsiders
63,rooster_davis,A good transfer of story from book to screen,8,1 March 2019,"I might not get the highest possible rating for my comments on this movie but I'm going to be totally honest. First, I read the book and then shortly afterward saw the movie. In my opinion the movie did a good job of getting the whole story from book to screen. A lot of the scenes caught the mood I felt when I read the book, or even shed some light on them for me. C. Thomas Howell played his part very well and showed acting skill, but he just seemed too nice, too sensitive to enjoy fighting for its own sake the way his brothers did. I could believe Darry and Soda looking forward to a fight with the Socs but I just did not get the feeling from PonyBoy that he was a fighter. Even Johnny Cade seemed more on edge, more 'ready to fight' than PonyBoy, who played all his scenes really well - he just didn't convince me he was someone who enjoyed a fight.Of all the actors cast for the film, and really all were done well, I think Ralph Macchio as Johnny Cade was the most perfectly cast based on how I perceived him to be from reading the book.To be honest, when reading the book I could tell it was written by a woman. I enjoyed it very much, and would say if you have a few hours, the book is not too long to read and I'd recommend it even more highly than the film.The Outsiders is a very good film in any case and worth watching.",The Outsiders
64,the_Poppuns,The Outsiders: the Complete Novel,10,14 September 2005,"Let me get this out of the way. I LOVE The Outsiders. It's been firmly in my top 5 movies for about 20 years. So I was really excited to see this special edition, which I did in New York on the big screen.The added scenes are awesome. I'm not one who likes people go to and tinker with their films but these scenes were nearly perfect inclusions. What wasn't so awesome is the music that's been added to this version, in fact, it's an abomination.Never in a million years would I have expected Elvis to wreak havoc on one of my most beloved movies, especially since I love Elvis. But a bunch of his songs and some surfin' safari tracks are suddenly present as if someone took a Tarantino soundtrack and just stuck it on The Outsiders for the heck of it. At first I tried to put up with it, but in no time I was cringing. Songs were flat out ruining the movie and in some cases overpowering the dialogue. I felt gutted like someone had stabbed me.What these songs did was make the movie peppy. This movie is not supposed to be light, it's drama all the way. But I think this new peppy soundtrack may have convinced a fellow theatergoer that this was a musical comedy, as he continued to laugh at anything that could even be remotely considered funny, odd, or not entirely tragic (including a scene in Johnny's hospital room and after the ""Let's do it for Johnny"" line). The music even screwed up the rumble. The only thing that could be worse than this is if 20 years from now Peter Jackson re-scores the Battle at Helm's Deep with the theme from Benny Hill.That's what this new soundtrack did. It made everything SILLY. Seeing this almost makes me want to forgive Darth Vader's hot pink lightsaber from the OT DVDs. I just wish these directors would realize that the magic of their films has everything to do with the time they were released. If, back in the day, you couldn't get the songs you wanted, or the special effects you needed didn't exist, maybe it was because the film gods didn't want you to have them. Once you go back and cram this stuff in, whether you originally intended it to be there or not, the spell is broken. The magic is gone.The Outsiders(1983) is a 10/10 from me. The version I grew up loving, I had actually taped off TV. And it had scenes that are part of this new version, not the one that's been available on video all this time. These scenes were at the end, including the hearing and Soda running away. I don't know how I'm ever going to see that version again.The Outsiders: The Complete Novel(2005) is a 5/10. I know music is important in film but I never knew how important until now. This version didn't just disappoint me, it upset me. If you loved this movie all these years like I did, I can't imagine that you'll be happy with this. And can you believe I waited to buy it on DVD because I hoped for additional scenes? I should have just bought the other one in the first place. I can't even believe that I'm not going to be at the store bright and early Tuesday morning for a special edition of the Outsiders. :(",The Outsiders
65,AbhiMathews,Clash of two of the same,5,29 September 2014,"The goal to war is almost as aimless as its outcome. Those who fight rarely even know what they're going into combat for, and those that do rarely want to participate. It's easy to fight your neighbour when you see them as your enemy, but spending even a moment with them will help you realize how unnecessary all the anger and combat truly is.Ponyboy is introduced to a world of pain. Whether it's the constant battles with the Socs, the struggle to fight stereotypes, or simply trying to survive, being a poor teenager in a rough neighbourhood is never easy. Especially when life and death are as swift as a blink, time is a valued commodity that is often not captured. The purpose of fighting is focused on in-depth in this movie, and it displays its futility. The Outsiders tells the tale of a courageous teenager and the circumstances he deals with along with his ""family."" Although the overall story is touching, the plot delivery is rather weak and simply not very stimulating except for a few scenes. The respective actors fit their roles well, but their acting was mediocre for the most part. Above all, The Outsiders is a great story yet the film fails to enrapture me which is my main disappointment.Nonetheless, with the strong message it sends, it is certainly worth the watch. The Outsiders is a tale for the ages, just one that can be told better.",The Outsiders
66,mharrison-17627,Good,8,27 November 2019,"A good film, marred by the awful performance of C. Thomas Howell as Ponyboy. Not surprisingly he went on to do absolutely nothing of any note afterwards.",The Outsiders
67,byrann_gowan,What friends are for,8,28 January 2012,"In ""The Outsiders,"" we have two gangs who rule the streets: the Socs and the Greasers. The Socs are the ones that have it all, while the Greasers are labelled as ""hoodlums."" In the midst of it all is Ponyball, a kid Greaser and our protagonist, who is unlike any of the other Greasers in the movie; instead of fighting, he likes to watch sunsets, read books like ""Gone With the Wind,"" and he has good grades in school. This is a really powerful film; I usually never give adaptations of books a perfect score, but this one was so true to the book, that the changes are only minor changes. Thanks Francis Ford Coppola, you did an amazing job! The actors are always what makes the movies shine for me, and here, it is no different. Leif Garrett is great as Bob, the Soc whose fateful end sparks a turn of events in the movie. Diane Lane is wonderful as Cherry, the girl who is cool with both gangs. Tom Cruise is fantastic as Steve, Soda's friend. Emilio Estevez is great as Two-bit, the character of the gang. The late great Patrick Swayze, as always, does a good job as the oldest brother Darry who is just trying to keep his family of brothers together. Rob Lowe is wonderful as Soda, who is my favourite character, because, even though he is a wild character, at heart he is someone who cares and hurts, especially when Darry and Ponyboy are fighting. Matt Dillon is cool as Dallas, the Greaser who has a cold hatred for anything in the world. Ralph Maccio is Johnny, who, like Ponyboy, is tired of all the fighting, and just wants to live life. What happens to him is truly tragic. And, of course, C. Thomas Howell is great as Ponyboy, the boy who wants to live life outside of being a Greaser, but who is stuck in the middle of it, nevertheless.Overall, it's a great film, filled with lots of talent that we would recognize in today's films. This film not only shows us that even people on the wrong side of the law has feelings, but it also shows the bond between friendships, no matter what. A perfect adaptation of the novel, and a 10/10 for me.",The Outsiders

I forget) but I imagined the church being..well a church but in the movie it looked like a hut out in Africa or something (did anybody else think that?) At least I'm not the only one to think that this movie was a terrible adaption to a good book (just look at the other comments!)

69,cwbellor,Juggernaut Jrama of Jaded Juvenile Delinquency,10,28 August 2012,"One particular scene of the classic Outsiders stands out among the rest. A trio of young greaseritos go to a drive-in where they run into a teenage Diane Lane and her friend. Among the greasers is Matt Dillon who flirts with Diane Lane but immediately notices that she has a problem with yelling in his face. Despite this, he slows the charm train down so that he can level with her. He calmly asks her if she would like a 7-up or a coca-cola, but it turns out that Diane is a Pepsi girl and she yells at Dillon again. The Outsiders is a juggernaut jrama of jaded juvenile delinquency! I won't get into the plot, but the final half hour provides a climax as lean, mean and teen as James Dean. The greasers do battle with the Socs – and yes, they have impeccable foot garments – in a muddy rumble that doesn't disappoint. Ironically, the only greaser absent from the film's climactic combat is the Karate Kid himself, Ralph Macchio. The other greasers seem aware that they must compensate for this disadvantage as they do handstands on fences and backflips off of cars in an effort to induce each other into a rip-roaring rumble rage. Does it work? You'll have to sit down, slick your hair back and find out. Stay gold!",The Outsiders
70,twhiteson,Ninety minute ad for Tiger Beat,4,25 April 2018,"Francis Ford Coppola stated he was inspired to make this movie after by being lobbied to do so by middle-school students. S.E.Hinton's 1967 juvenile novel, ""The Outsiders,"" was a required reading staple for American middle-school students throughout the 70's and 80's. So, Coppola and his financial backers probably thought they had a built-in money-maker due to virtually every American teenager being exposed to the book.Set in mid-1960's Oklahoma, ""The Outsiders"" is about a group of working-class teens and their lives in a very socially stratified small city. The ""Greasers,"" the poor kids from the other side of the tracks, are locked in constant conflict with the ""Socs""- the well-to-do kids from the nice parts of town. The story is told from the viewpoint of ""Ponyboy Curtis"" (C. Thomas Howell) a young Greaser who is being raised by his older brothers, ""Darry"" (Patrick Swayze) and ""Sodapop"" (Rob Lowe), after their parents' deaths.Ponyboy and his best friend, ""Johnny"" (Ralph Macchio), get into a confrontation with some drunken Socs who take offense to Ponyboy and Johnny being too friendly with Soc girl, ""Cherry"" (Diane Lane). Violence ensues and a Soc ends-up dead. Ponyboy and Johnny flee with the assistance of Greaser bad-boy ""Dally"" (Matt Dillon). Will they ever find peace where people are just people rather than members of ""tribes?""Hinton's novel is really juvenile with its ridiculous character names and teen fantasy world in which everyone seems to be devoid of parents. However, that's not surprising considering Hinton was just a teen herself when she wrote it. Still, its unique narrative structure and its plea for understanding between social groups quickly made it a teaching tool for middle-schools. It's possible a good movie could have been made from it.This isn't it. Instead, Coppola created a ninety minute ad for Tiger Beat magazine aimed at pleasing adolescent/teenage girls. One knows one is in trouble from the opening credits with its bombastic ""Gone With The Wind"" style title and treacly Stevie Wonder song. It only gets worse as the movie introduces supposedly ""tough"" characters played by actors who are almost as pretty as Diane Lane. The cast is a who's who of early 1980's ""non-threatening boy"" actors. It's the pin-up boys from the puppy-crush, fangirl mags: Howell, Macchio, Lowe, and even Leif Garrett makes an appearance. They're all filmed to look ""adorable"" and make little girls' ***** tingle. Their acting on the other hand? Ugh. Stiff, silly, and overwrought. The only actor who comes off fairly well is Tom Cruise prior to having his teeth fixed. He has a very small role, but he does make an attempt to approximate a working-class Oklahoma accent.The entire film is a melodramatic mess. Virtually every scene is over-acted with an absurdly maudlin and overripe musical score courtesy of Coppola's composer father, Carmine. (Even Coppola has recognized how that terrible score undermined this film because he replaced it in one of the DVD releases. Of course, this was done after his father had passed.)It's still shocking that this teeny girl, pin-up sapfest is a Coppola film. After the incredible struggle to complete ""Apocalypse Now,"" it appears Coppola just wanted to coast on his rep and his heart was no longer into film-making. That may explain why ""The Outsiders"" and Coppola's other adaption of a Hinton book, 1983's ""Rumble Fish,"" are so terrible.",The Outsiders
71,Raptorclaw155,Not What I Remember it Being,5,27 April 2020,"As a kid in middle school where reading the book was a requirement for my English class, and subsequently seeing this film adaptation, I thought this film was quite good. I enjoyed it well enough but never bothered revisiting it until recently after seeing American Graffiti for the umpteenth time.The Outsiders, unfortunately, ended up being a bit of a let down. It isn't bad but it's painfully unremarkable. The film is competently made and the story and character motivations are all intact from the novel but its execution is lacking. The acting is a bit flat a lot of the time and the pacing of some of the scenes can be quite jarring. Yet, despite that, in most instances you don't really notice those issues because they don't really pop out at you most of the time, however, if they did it would probably make for a more interesting viewing experience.This film is so plain it's difficult to put into words. It carries with it a similar feeling as the 1980 remake of The Jazz Singer- oddly enough. But the difference is that this film, on all levels, is a better film than The Jazz Singer (1980)- yet I would rather see that than this because this film doesn't really have character to it. It has a made-for-TV feeling similar to The Jazz Singer (1980) to the point where it left me surprised that it got a theatrical release.Ultimately, this film fits very nicely into the tier of the types of films I could fall asleep to- which isn't necessarily an insult. But I can't say that this is a very engaging viewing experience, at least for me, but seeing as how opinions about this film are so polarized, I would recommend that any curiosity about this film be satisfied only by seeing it rather than watching/reading/listening to reviews.",The Outsiders

We'll never see a young group of actors that moved on to successful careers. What an amazing cast!,The Outsiders
78,BestBenedikt,Disappointing by Coppola-standards,6,26 November 2018,"Just to clarify this beforehand, I saw the ""Complete Novel"" re-release of THE OUTSIDERS, which is about 20 minutes longer than the original cut. While the additional lenght might help with some pacing issues the theatrical release had and provide more fleshed out characters, it didn't completely work for me.I found the overuse of 60s rock music to be quite distracting. The fact that Coppola underlines lots of serious scenes with that kind of trivial music makes for some awkward tonally inconsistencies within the film. Aside from that, some of the character development just doesn't work that well - most noticeable the character of Dallas played by Matt Dillon, who goes haywire towards the end of the film, although he seemed mentally stable for 90% of the runtime.The film is still entertaining and definitely provides a great cast, but considering the fact that Coppola directed APOCALYPSE NOW four years earlier, I can't help but find it ultimately disappointing.",The Outsiders
79,jbuck_919,People commenting on this seriously are missing the point,8,15 June 2002,"I don't know about Coppola, and of course S.E. Hinton is a woman, but a movie like this is only made for one reason:  exploitationally for gay men who would give their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to be surrounded by the likes of this cast.  They're white trash, they smoke, they're handsome, they don't give a s*** about anything, they have no real girl friends; they're perfectly in the mold.  It can't be a coincidence.  It is irrelevant that they did not make a very good movie.",The Outsiders
80,stargirlrk,"Don't see this terrible movie. Read the book if you can, which was good.",4,2 December 2002,"The novel ""The Outsiders"" was excellent and I was expecting the movie to be excellent as well. But it was not. It had an emotionless, pointless feel to it and the acting was extremely bad. It is true a lot of the time that movies based on books turn up very bad, and this is a clear example of that. Read the book if you haven't read it, for it was excellent. This movie was a cold turkey. Even if you have a friend rent it so you can avoid paying for it, I would avoid this movie. It is not worth the time that you waste watching it.",The Outsiders
81,jeffman52001,An all time classic!,10,19 December 2004,"The Outsiders is a great film, well done and well acted, I read the novel by S.E. Hinton, great book. I am glad they made this movie back in 1983.The Outsiders touched on a lot of issues when it came to having money and not having money, the ""greasers"" where the poor kids from the north side of town and the ""socs"" are the rich kids from the south side of town. Matt Dillon(Over The Edge, The Flamingo Kid) as Dallas Winston, Tom Cruise(Top Gun, Vanilla Sky, and Minority Report)as Steve, Ralph Macchio(The Karate Kid Parts I,II,and III) as Johnny Cade, C. Thomas Howell(The Hitcher, Red Dawn,and Soul Man) as Ponyboy Curtis, Rob Lowe(About Last Night, St. Elmo's Fire and Wayne's World)as Sodapop Curtis, Patrick Swayze(Red Dawn, Grandview U.S.A. and Point Break) as Darrell Curtis. Emilio Estevez(The Breakfast Club, Repo Man, St. Elmo's Fire and Nightmares) as Two Bit Matthews, Diane Lane(My Dog Skip, Streets of Fire, and Unfaithful) as Cherry Valance, Darren Dalton(Red Dawn) as Randy, and former teen heart throb Leif Garrett as Bob Sheldon, William Smith(Any Which Way You Can, Red Dawn and Conan The Barbarian) as the stork clerk, Michelle Meyrink(Valley Girl, Real Genius, and Revenge of the Nerds) as Marcia, make up the great cast for this awesome film.The movie really touched me in lots of ways, the story of kids being on the wrong side of the tracks, like Ponyboy and Johnny, who have a lot of heart and goodness inside. The movie does show what the true meaning of friendship and spirituality, especially Ponyboy loving sunsets. The poem by Robert Frost, ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"", does have a lot of meaning about youth and the moments of enjoying things you find wonderful when you are young, you should always embrace them.I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars. Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job directing the movie.The song, ""Stay Gold"", is such a great song, sung really well by Stevie Wonder.",The Outsiders
82,JoshuaMLosapio,A Lackluster Adaptation of a Classic Book,6,21 August 2019,"I remember enjoying S.E. Hinton's ""The Outsiders"" when I read it in high school, so I've always looked forward to watching the 1983 film adaptation directed by Francis Ford Coppola - the man who made three of my all-time favorite movies (The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and Apocalypse Now). Unfortunately, after several years of putting it off, I was disappointed by Coppola's mediocre take on ""The Outsiders."" As in any Coppola movie the performances are top-notch and the music choices amplify the overall viewing experience. But I was surprised by the almost complete lack of effort put into establishing and developing characters, or even crafting a focused and entertaining story. 20 minutes into the film I was totally uninvested in the central characters or what little existed of a plot. Coppola's talents as a visual genius are no where to be seen in ""The Outsiders,"" which looks more like a low budget TV movie than a major motion picture. If I hadn't sat through the opening titles I never would've guessed that ""The Outsiders"" was a Francis Ford Coppola film.I really wanted to like ""The Outsiders,"" but sadly the film just doesn't hold water. Unlike the original novel, which remains a classic to this day. Hinton's book gets high marks, but Coppola's movie doesn't. 6/10.",The Outsiders
83,ken_bethell,Best left back in 1983,4,9 June 2009,I hadn't read the book or seen the original film before sitting down to watch this 20th Anniversary Edition with Coppola's intro and comments from Swayze and Laine amongst others about their roles in the production.I'm sorry but that was about as interesting as it got and I'm of the opinion that this film should have been left back in 1983 for it does not stand the test of time.I don't normally agree with the film critics but on this occasion they got it spot on first time. The film said nothing new then or now.The violence was sanitized and the big fight scene badly choreographed. The editing wasn't any better either.I half expected at anytime for someone to break into '... when you're a Jet ...' However the film did have undoubted nostalgia. The Hollywood 'Brat Pack' were coming of age and it was interesting to reflect on the direction their individual careers have taken them since.They were fortunate perhaps that they didn't have to rely on this film to enhance their chances of stardom. In the case of Diane Laine it may even have been detrimental.,The Outsiders
84,gurghi-2,stay gold,8,3 December 2005,"A terrific tweener for kids of any era. Serious but sweet, and refreshingly free of cynicism.Godfather Coppola has a real way with family, go figure. But here he keeps the themes and emotions simple. One of the reasons for this story's lasting power is that it was written by a teenager, and so accurately reflects kids' perspective. It would have been very tempting to try and infuse an adaptation with ""layers,"" to comment on the action and show yourself superior, but Coppola exercises great restraint and appropriate respect for the material. He knows it isn't profound stuff, but he understands that it *feels* profound to kids who identify with it. In walking this tightrope, he creates a rare thing: a movie that's for kids but neither talks down to or indulges them.Lowe, Dillon, Estevez, Howell, Macchio, Garrett, Swayze. Only Cruise and Lane (and Sofia!) seem bigger now than they are here. That, and the 20-some years since, makes The Outsiders all the more poignant.",The Outsiders
85,sublime501,Doesn't quite pack a punch.,7,10 July 2004,"THE OUTSIDERS is the tale of different classes growing up in Oklahoma (I think), divided into the Socs and the greasers. The Socs are upper-class, snotty, and arrogant; the greasers are lower-class, humble and typically nice, but more than willing to fight if provoked. One night, Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) and Johnny Cade (Ralph Macchio) find themselves being chased by some drunken Socs. When they try to drown Ponyboy, Johnny stabs and kills the leader Bob (Leif Garrett) in an attempt to save his friend, causing the rest of the Socs to scatter. When Ponyboy comes to, the friends realize what they've done and run to Dally (Matt Dillon) for a place to hide out. He sends them to an abandoned church in a nearby town, where they stay for a few days until the heat dies down. In the midst of this, the two become close friends.When Dally returns to tell them that the news is quieted down and they have Bob's girlfriend Cherry (Diane Lane) testifying for the greasers, Ponyboy and Johnny decide to return to town. When they recede to the church to collect what few things they had there, they find that it has set fire and several kids are trapped inside! Ponyboy, Johnny, and (reluctantly) Dally step in to help them. They save all of the children successfully, and Ponyboy gets out all right, but Dally has some burns and Johnny's back was broken by a falling beam. The three return to their hometown (though Dally and Johnny are in the hospital) and find themselves rendered heroes. Meanwhile, the two groups are about to have a rumble to settle their differences once and for all, and everything boils up to a tragic conclusion.I used to love THE OUTSIDERS, but re-watching it recently, I wasn't quite sure why. It's a pretty good movie, but it definitely has its fair share of flaws. Though I read the book and loved the story, it's definitely not expressed as well in the movie (though that's to be expected). Many of the moments that could be viewed by many as symbolic and touching, I view as cheesy. And there are a lot of these moments--they're almost cringe-worthy. There's one flashback sequence that is quite unnecessary and very corny--but only one, which is good. It's not nearly as powerful and sad as it could have been, but I'm unsure who to blame this on. The other main flaw is Matt Dillon's acting in this one--he was great at playing an insensitive jerk, but he was terrible whenever he tried to show emotion.However, with the bad comes the good. The story is great (though the deleted scenes of the Curtis brothers' bond would have added a lot to the movie), and executed quite well. Most of the other actors are great in their roles, namely C. Thomas Howell and Ralph Macchio as the two leads. The supporting cast is great too, namely Patrick Swayze and Rob Lowe as Ponyboy's brothers Darry and Sodapop--though their characters were underdeveloped. Diane Lane was great as the greasers' ""spy"" Cherry, and Leif Garrett was as well, surprisingly. It's fun to see famous actors of today back then--especially Tom Cruise in a small role.THE OUTSIDERS is a pretty good movie with a great storyline and great acting (for the most part). It has a great display of cheesy moments (far too many), and a great tragic ending, but it doesn't quite pack a punch. 7/10.",The Outsiders
86,McCormack7,ALL STAR CAST RAISES 'THE OUTSIDERS',10,17 April 2001,"The film may not be as good as the book, but bearing in mind the films shortened runtime, it is still a compelling watch. The film may have dated slightly but it was styled that way. The all star cast is what really makes 'The Outsiders'. Seeing all those famous names and then 'star spotting' as they appear. Actors like TOM CRUISE (Mission Impossible, MI2, Top Gun), MATT DILLON (Something About Mary, To Die For, RumbleFish) and DIANE LANE (Perfect Storm, Murder at 1600, Streets of Fire) have all become big stars, and PATRICK SWAYZE, ROB LOWE, EMILIO ESTEVEZ, C THOMAS HOWELL, and RALPH MACCHIO didn't do badly either for a while.

TOM CRUISE (Mission Impossible, Vanilla Sky), DIANE LANE (Unfaithful, The Perfect Storm), MATT DILLON (Wild Things, Drugstore Cowboy) to name a few are amazing in this early outing.

But, of course I was disappointed. It's underwritten and overacted, and the ""rumble"" scene is the biggest disappointment of the film. The only thing that showed me that these kids were ""troubled"" was the fact that they were always dirty. Maybe if they took a bath every once in a while they might actully be accepted.",The Outsiders

91,WilderMovieReviews,A very hard hitting and moving story,10,19 March 2012,"A very hard hitting and moving story about rival gangs and the effect it has on the lives of the people in and around the gangs. The story follows two of the younger greasers after one of them accidentally kills a rival gang member in self defence. They leave town and believe they will have to remain on the run forever.With a cast to die for, The Outsiders is an incredible, hard hitting film. Portrayed in a believable and moving way, the cast includes Matt Dillon, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, C. Thomas Howell and Rob Lowe. But Ralph Macchio stands out in this film as Johnny Cade.The direction of Francis Ford Coppola along with stunning performances from the cast bring this film to life. You feel for the characters as they take you on an emotional roller-coaster. You laugh along with them and share in the anguish and feel the pain they all go through just to survive. It is hard not to watch the film now without comparing other films the cast have made since this film. But for many of the cast, it is up there with the finest performances of their career.The film is an adaption of a classic novel by S.E. Hinton who was just 16 when the novel was first published in 1967. It was also her first novel. The book has become part of school English curriculum",The Outsiders

Thomas Howell, who is one of the most underrated actors out there.  The story is good and solid.

Francis Ford Coppola has adapted almost every detail of the book into this movie. I thought the acting was great and the plot was good for teenagers, which is the movie's, as well as the book's, target audience. I was surprised on how many stars were in this movie (seven) and it was much better than I thought it would be. It didn't seem cheesy and small but you felt like you were watching a real film.

(I know the book is usually better than the movie though). It's a feel good movie with tearjerking scenes as we watch the group of poor, underdog boys stick it out for themselves against the rich kids. In another director's hands, this story could have been trite and simplistic, but Coppola did such a great job with the film that anyone who watches it cannot help but cheer for the poor boys and feel each injustice done to them with anger as though it had been done to them.

The director Francis Ford Coppola laid down his desire for dark drama and intertwined a fresh cast of faces no audience had ever witnessed. Some of which went on to carry fortunate future titles, building long careers in acting. With this cast alone, a symmetry of poverty was produced in an honest portrait of Rich Kid Vs. Poor Kid. We are all invited into the diary of a lost boy group without assistance attending school under the thumb of wealthy bullies.

The cast was great and led to big breaks for all of them. I think that they should've included more about Sandy who was Sodapop's girlfriend who got pregnant and had to move away. But besides that, the movie was almost identical to the book. The soundtrack for The Complete Novel is much better than the original. It includes songs that greasers of that time would've listened to. It's about growing up on the wrong side of the tracks and having to deal with what you got.

Overall a pretty good movie and it's really cool to see all of those young, soon to be Hollywood heavyweights in one of their very first, if not first movie role.The very worst part of this movie - the soundtrack. The music is absolutely horrendous. Francis Ford Coppola hired his father Carmine to compose the score and it is just awful. During dramatic moments in the movie, the music sounds like something you would hear in a kindergarten class - lighthearted, more like a carnival ride than a death scene.Other than the terrible music, still a very watchable movie.",The Outsiders

'The Outsiders' is one of those films. And it is an instant classic for many reasons. But I think the top reason being, is some excellent performances by some, then, up and coming yet very talented young actors. It's too bad that only The Young Artist Awards was the only ' entertainment awards organization' to recognize this film with its 1984 'Best Young Motion Picture Actor in a Feature Film' award going to C. Thomas Howell for his portrayal of Ponyboy Curtis. And it's too bad when a film such as this is so totally overlooked by the Academy Awards and other entertainment awards organizations. Also, outstanding performances turned in by Ralph Macchio and Matt Dillon. While the film had a raw hard edge to it, almost all of the 'main' characters at some point or another showed their 'soft underbellies' with tender and highly emotional moods that are a part of teen-aged angst.",The Outsiders
103,quark18,Written by a teen and beloved by teens,8,30 July 2017,"I love this movie and the book and have read and watched it at least 100 times since I was a kid in the 80s. It never occurred to me to notice what adults thought of ""The Outsiders"" so I was surprised to see the negative critical reviews on IMDb. The novel was written by a 16-year-old for other teens and it sings to its target audience. Those outside the target audience, like professional adult critics, will probably never ""get it"" but that's okay. Watching it again as an adult, I become a kid again instead of evaluating the film with my well-developed adult critical thinking skills. Above all, the film captures the essence of ""Nothing gold can stay."" Yes, some of the lines are wooden, some of the acting is wooden, and Dally's death scene is particularly cringe-worthy. Some scenes would have benefited from longer dramatic pauses. The film has rough edges, just as kids do. But on the whole, it understands and respects the emotional, social, and economic struggles of kids who are working their way through to adulthood, from their perspective. I'm particularly impressed that it deals with class issues in a way that few movies today do. There is very little difference between Darry and his old high school buddy Paul, for example, in terms of character and abilities, but there will be a huge difference in their economic lives as adults because of who their parents were. We can have sympathy for both Johnny, who has abusive parents, and for Bob, who also suffered from parental neglect in a different way. Ponyboy and Cherry both love sunsets, though one is a poor 14-year-old boy and the other is a rich 16-year-old girl who lives on the other side of town.It is remarkable that nearly all the young men cast in this movie went on to become big stars.

Everything was quite predictable, bad acting, and the music score was the worst. (note the credits - a bit of nepotism here) The ""big"" heroic scene where Ralphie rescues all the kids from the burning church... what the heck were they doing taking a tour of the abandoned church in the first place, how did every entrance get boarded up when our two lovable bad guys came and go as they pleased?

106,agitpop,Like Dirty Dancing Without Girls,5,16 August 2006,"I watched this movie mainly for the reason that it s a Coppola-Movie. I was confused from the first minute on, because it looked more like a a sentimental journey into adolescence from the first scene (sunset, soft music, it makes me cringe). Youth gangs in the 60ies. OK. Nice. I like the moral values, that are transported , even if they are as shallow as I have seldom seen it before (violence = bad; anyone s the same, if with or without money; even poor people have moral values).So please don t get me wrong, but I thought this movie was somehow ""gay"". I don t have anything against gays, some of my best friends are and they re great persons, that I respect and love, I just didn t think that all that pubertal erotica as its shown in this dirty piece of a movie is cool. It s not cool at all. It s baroque. Maybe other ones don t see it like that but I thought it was ""greasy"" (to speak in the language of the film) and ""kitschy"". This is not Marlon Brandon and it s not A Streetcar Named Desire (although it plays in a similar context and settings). Brando was cool. It s also not Lord Of The Flies. Lord Of The Flies was tough, one can think about the movie for a long time. But ""Outsiders"" didn t make me think about anything for more than 30 seconds, not even when the movie was running. How cool is Patrick Swayzeeeee in his too tight jeans, jumping around with his greasy mullet like a monkey after an (s)experimental lobotomy with testicles swollen to the size of coconuts? It s like Dirty Dancing without the girls. I wouldn't t have wondered if there were dancing and singing scenes in it. And actually I wouldn t have wondered if there would have appeared The Hoff, too. The film shows sweaty dirty boys hugging and punching all the time, but it s not even homo, it s just plain stupid and ""shallow"" is actually a too good adjective for the moral values, that this dirty piece of a movie actually transports. It s just a big gay-ish opera with crying poor dirty kids who d like to have a homo experience but because they are too stupid, they have to punch each other instead of heaving the real thing. Jesus... The movie gets 5 out of 10. It s mediocre. In my opinion the worst thing that can happen to a movie. I like the ones that I gave one point only actually more than this one. Seriously. Unbelievable that Coppola has done that. Shame on you F.F.! Bad bad boy! What a crap...",The Outsiders

This is a fun movie about two rivail groups the socs and greasers told through the eyes of the 14 year old ponyboy. This movie is great not only for middle schoolers but for older adults as well because it teaches the timeless lesson of differences in us and others. I highly suggest this because you want soon forget it and it's not long and complicated. It's plot is down too earth not to mention it's characters. It is a highly creative film and it is true to the story which is another reason I like it. Even though it has sort of an abrupt ending it is efficient and powerful.

I read the book, and of course the book is always better because they have all the time to add in details, but with the time frame given to the video, the two were similar in comparison. I was reading along in the book as the characters passed lines. This movie had very detailed scenery, and I couldn't help but to cry when one of the gang's boys (who shall remain un-named to keep the suspense) got shot by the police.

Patrick Swayze is a perfect fit for the brawny Darry Curtis; Ralph Macchio plays Johnny Cade, the ""beaten puppy dog"" of the Greasers very well; C.

Emilio Estevez as Two-Bit; Rob Lowe as the handsome Sodapop Curtis... and so on.Not only does the movie stay true to the book as far as characterization goes, but the movie's plot is also fairly close to the novel.  It's nice to see Hollywood realizing that they can't outdo a great author's work, at least in this case.Although the movie is not quite as good as the book, as is usually the case, _The Outsiders_ certainly does the book justice, and if you liked the book when you read it in school and you never got to see the movie, you should definitely check it out.",The Outsiders
112,t-paulsm,THE OUTSIDERS - THE COMPLETE NOVEL - A must-see for anyone who loved the first film & the novel!,10,18 October 2005,"Man, was I happy when I watched this flick again 20 years after seeing it the theatre and wondering what the H.-E.-double-hockey-sticks happened to much of the novel's content when it came to Coppola's film adaptation.Well, for anyone else who wondered the same thing, or who felt as did I, that the soundtrack was rather wishy-washy and didn't capture the actual early 50's feeling and time setting of the story, this new release is absolutely fantastic!With a bow to Francis Ford Coppala's pops, Carmine, the man who scored the theatrical release of the movie with its intensity, its melodrama and it offering the film that almost ""Rebel Without A Cause"" feel, I prefer what Coppala has done for the new DVD release.The new music has everything from Elvis to (I think, though I could be wrong) Link Wray on it, and it sets the mood and the period of the story much more appropriately than the original release's score.With 22 minutes of the movie returned to its proper place, the story unfolds in a much more natural way, allowing characters and their relationships to develop in a less contrived, more organic manner.The 2 DVD set includes all kinds of wee treats, like the video clips shot during rehearsal time (video was new & revolutionary for filmmakers at the time, and Coppola shot the whole picture on video prior to shooting on film), a fun 20 year reunion of many of the cast members commenting on the film, joking with each other, and reminiscing about how young and inexperienced they all were back then. We even get to see the original readings & auditions for the movie's parts, which have some interesting surprise stars who initially read for the film.I was pleased to see focus put on the teacher and the school kids responsible for bringing the book to Coppola's attention by sending him a petition requesting he be the one to direct the movie, as he'd done such a beautiful job directing ""The Black Stallion"", another teenage classic. There is a great NBC news clip with Swayze & C. Thomas Howell powowing with the students after the release of the film, and Swayze thanking the school for truly beginning his career via his having been cast in the film as Darryl.Overall, the movie is now what it was intended to be in my humble opinion.If ya dug it then, you'll dig it even more now! Hope this helps y'all! ~T.Paul",The Outsiders

Key parts to the storyline were just cut out and other wierd stuff was added in. The opening song for one thing, plus all the other music in the movie was really stupid, and at the end when Pony is reading the letter from Johnny and all of a sudden the camera zooms in on Johnny's eyeball, what the heck is up with that?! Lots of little quirky things like this were stuck in there and made the movie all the less enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the book, it's still my favorite to this day, but I just think they should have left it at that and not bothered with a movie at all.",The Outsiders
115,WhisperingBells1959,Not the greatest...,5,21 November 2007,"I don't hate this movie, but I don't think it was great. There was a lot of background music, and sometimes it was just distracting to the movie. To me, the parts when Johnny and Pony got jumped and when they rescued those kids in the church fire had background music that kind of didn't fit the mood and was a little too loud. Some of Dally's lines bothered me, like at the movie theater when Johnny told him to stop harassing Cherry, he said, ""What'd you say to me, you little sh*t, what'd you say to me?"" I thought that was untrue to the book, as no one spoke that way to Johnny, because he was so sensitive. And also the line, ""Fight it for Johnny."" It just seemed weak to me.The only other things that really bothered me was the scene when Darry hit Ponyboy and the scene in which they (Darry and Ponyboy) are reunited in the hospital. When Darry hit Ponyboy, Ponyboy got right up and ran away, and immediately afterward, Darry says, ""I didn't mean to."" There was no moment of shock at the action, from both of them, as described in the book. The hospital scene is very similar, in my opinion. I saw very little awkwardness between Darry and Ponyboy, I didn't see any hesitation in Ponyboy as he ran to greet him. Moments like these were pretty vital in the book.Overall, it was a pretty good movie; I just don't find it as great as other people do.",The Outsiders

As a boy, it was a very influential movie for me. watching these kids growing up on the wrong side of the tracks - mostly with no parents or parents that don't care about them - was a wake up call from my quite safe and easy suburban life.The story follows the life of ""Pony Boy"" Curtis. A young high school kid who struggles to stay alive in a rough and tough town.Eventually an event leads to Pony Boy and best friend Johnny having to leave town. The fear of being alone and trying to survive with no money - clothes - or most other things is thrilling to watch and sad at the same time.The Outsiders is a very dramatic film with very touching moments.

And sorry to say, much of the material was feeble. Not sure the lead character helped, but it's almost as if the director wanted to make a romance. The result is a film that stumbles its way through 100 minutes, wasting so much potential. If the movie didn't mope and whine its way through, trying too hard to be a tearjerker without showcasing any real emotion, it could have actually been special. Not to forget it attempting to bash some moral story onto the viewer, but not knowing what was the moral story it wanted to bash into people in the first place. The result is a movie containing nothing to love, or hate. A vacuum.OK, it wasn't all bad, it was simply without direction or purpose.

There's also some really great dialogue and memorable lines with no fillers, which I'm sure was helped by the original book. (by S.E.Hinton).It almost seems like the film was made in the 1950/1960's (which is the era the book covers) not alongside ""Flashdance"" in 1983.Great cinematography throughout this movie, with beautiful colours and tones (a must on wide screen). This gives it a slightly theatrical feel and certain scenes have ""performance"" overtones.

And then news came out that this book was going to be made into a movie, and i was really excited to see it. It had some great stars in it, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, C Thomas Howe, Emillio Estevez and Matt DillionThis movie, i don't know how else to say it, SUCKED!!!! The acting was terrible, especially Diane Lane who played Cherry Valance, she was by far the worst actor in this movie.I cant see how anyone who read and liked the book could even begin to like this movie, it was obviously put together in a hurry, the actors, all of them didn't have a clue on how to portray these characters, i blame the director and the actors, poor job all the way around in my opinion.The Church was supposed to be on top of a huge hill, and there was no mention as to why Johnny and Ponyboy went into the church to save the kids in the first place, they just went in to save the kids in the movie, but the book says they went in because they felt responsible because they were the ones who were smoking in there.If you enjoyed the book, i recommend watching this movie just so you will appreciate the book even more.Terrible Terrible adaption of one of my favorite books growing up, SE Hinton you should be ashamed to allow this piece of crap to be put on the big screen",The Outsiders
121,jasonay,Wonderful and Artsy Teen-age Drama,8,28 October 2005,"The Outsiders is an incredible book, one which could have been transmitted to the screen in very different ways. It could have been a low-budget, straightforward version with plenty of rawness and realism, or this artsy adaption by Coppula. The movie is basically true to the book, but so much attention is put into atmosphere that the plot sometimes takes a backseat to the images. Shadows talk into sunsets, and there are many atmospheric shots at night, like the rumble. A teen-aged world of greasers and socs is effectively created, but would have been more realistic without all the glamor. Some teen-agers might have preferred a more realistic approach. That was then, this is now, another bestseller by Hinton, was directed in such a fashion. But for lovers of cinema, the Outsiders is an art house delight.",The Outsiders

It was terrible!!!!! Not half the book. Heck, not a tenth of the book.

The directing is unevenly paced, and sometimes gets so confusing it's hard to know what's going on.  The acting is some of the worst I've seen, right next to the remake of ""Psycho"".  The characters are unbelievable one dimensional, and one can't feel for them at all.  Some may argue this point, claiming the actors were young.  True, they were (and, on a lighter note, most of them haven't starred in recent ""quality"" movies in a long time), yet the acting is so inexcusable, they may as well just cast a few second graders.  The script, like the directing, is also confusing, and is so fake and hollywood-esque that they probably just pulled out a few lines from a Looney Tunes sketch, threw in a few swears and some blood, and called it ""The Outsiders"".Anyone want to know a good story?

125,missnavymoo2,"Romanticized ""Greasers""",7,5 January 2010,"Younger people may not know the term ""greasers"" unless they watch this movie (I'm not so young anymore; I knew the term long before the movie came out in 1983). Briefly, it refers to socioeconomically challenged or rebellious boys who wore their hair slightly longer and loaded with pomade or ""grease."" as well as leather jackets and blue jeans, as opposed to the ""socs"" (pronounced soshes)- the high society boys who wore short hair, no grease and, as Ponyboy says, ""madras"" pants. It's a 50s and 60s take on the age-old conflict of rich vs. poor. Briefly, this movie tells of the clashes between the aforementioned greasers and socs who live in Oklahoma in the early 1960s. Johnny Cade (played so well by Ralph Macchio) and his friend Ponyboy Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) are in a lot one night when a car full of soc boys come after them. Johnny kills the soc who, weeks before, had beaten him seriously. Johnny and Ponyboy, scared and not knowing what to do, seek help from a slightly older ""mentor"" and friend named Dally (Dallas) Winston (Matt Dillon), a hardened, incorrigible boy who seems hell-bent on living a life of crime but who genuinely cares about Johnny. Dally tells them to hide out at an abandoned church and for 5 days, the boys do just that, subsisting on bologna sandwiches, peanut butter and water. They spend the days playing cards, smoking, trying to catch small game and reading ""Gone With the Wind."" More dramatic things follow after Dally comes to rescue"" them from their hide-out.I've seen this move dozens of times and I've always enjoyed it but it is to the ""greaser"" genre what the ""Godfather"" movies are to organized crime - a romanticized look at a somewhat serious subject - the lives of ""greasers"" vs. socs. Is this a criticism? Not necessarily - this is a good movie and I always enjoy watching it. And it features several future stars such as the aforementioned Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell and Ralph Macchio. It also features Tom Cruise, Leif Garrett, Rob Lowe, Diane Lane and Patrick Swayze. The performances of such (then) young stars are excellent and the story flows. The lead music and main theme can be a bit mawkish at times - too sickeningly sweet for a movie about ""greasers"" and ""socs"" - ""The Cross and the Switchblade"" or even ""West Side Story"" this isn't. I loved the Robert Frost poem Ponyboy quotes while he and Johnny are on the run. And I love the song Stevey Wonder sings, using the Frost poem for the lyrics. But, again, it's too sweet for a movie about the greasers and the socs. These are minor criticisms but these may be the reason the movie was roundly panned when it first came out. Television tried to make a series out of it and it would have been a good idea but the series did not feature the same actors so it never took. Too bad - stories like this will always find an audience if the storytelling is well done and if the actors are convincing enough. I recommend this movie highly - in addition to the good acting, music and story, there seemed to be a real chemistry among the actors. Seeing the film also makes you want to read the book on which it was based - which is exactly what I did. I even read other S.E. Hinton books but this is my favorite story. Matt Dillon went on to act in ""Rumble Fish"" and ""Tex,"" films also based on Ms. Hinton's stories, but he was perfect as Dally.",The Outsiders
126,tapkac2,Another Classic Almost Ruined!!!! (by the Special Edition),7,23 September 2005,"First of all, I have to say that I have read and loved the book at least 12 times and have seen and loved this movie at least as many times since Late 1983/Early 1984. This, of course, was long before it was required reading in some schools.But I wrote THAT review back in 1998 on another website.-ANYWAY!- This new version may be okay to those watching the movie for the first time, but ...Once upon a time, there was a silent film called ""Metropolis"", which was quite interesting, last I remember.It was RUINED when it was re-released in the 1980's by having a bunch of 1980's pop music placed over the original score and soundtrack. Although I dig the song ""Radio Ga-Ga"" by Queen, IT DOES NOT BELONG IN A 1930's SILENT MOVIE!! (Nor did any other song, for that matter)Once upon another time, there was a movie about the late Hunter S. Thompson (Lord rest his soul) called ""Where the Buffalo Roam"", which you can only find on DVD now with a horrible 80's and/or 90's soundtrack dubbed over the original, even though (last I remember) the whole movie took place in the early to middle 1970's. (Of course, you might find the good version on E-bay)I hardly want to remind anyone about George Lucas' desecration of his own ""Star Wars"" Saga with such annoyances as Jar-Jar Binks, the new band in Jabba the Hutt's Palace, the ""Little Shop of Horrors"" Plant in the Sarlaac Pit, etcetera, and so on, ad nauseam.-SO ........-Now we have the Special Edition of ""The Outsiders"".The book, of course, hasn't changed and the movie now has all the scenes that were supposed to be in it the first time back in.It also has all sorts of documentaries and commentaries. One of the commentaries is by Francis Ford Coppola and the other is by C. Thomas Howell (Ponyboy), Ralph Macchio (Johnny), Patrick Swayze (Darrel/Darry), and Diane Lane (Sherry/Cherry).However, the special features, extra scenes back in (making it a bit closer to the book), and the commentaries are as far as the goodness goes ...The original movie had only a few old hit songs here and there and a good orchestral score that punctuated the scenes properly ...WHEN MUSIC OF ANY KIND WAS NEEDED.Now, with the Special Edition DVD, very little (if any) of the orchestral score is still in; most of the ""new"" movie has been drowned by random Late-50's/Early 60's pop songs even in parts that didn't need music to punctuate it in the first place.Every moment that had feeling (or was at least supposed to have feeling) is suddenly Trivialized by yet another pulp pop-song-of-the-time coming on even when A) the scene wasn't supposed to have music, B) even if the said scene did require music, the original score actually set the scene's mood while the pulp pop-song seems to be just thrown in for the sake of having a pop-song in it.If you're new to watching this movie, or if you saw it long ago and don't remember the original score, then, by all means, GET THIS MOVIE! It's One of the Greatest Stories Ever Told.However, if you know the original version like you know your own face (as I do), then stick with the book, watch the 1983 version (so the book will always be better) and only RENT the ""New"" Version.I say this as a warning, even though I spent almost an entire weekend watching this over and over, ...GETTING USED TO THE NEW ""SCORE""!Aaaannnnnnnnd ...

Matt Dillon was a very cheesy actor in his earlier career, and though this movie hosts a whole lot of popular names it isn't worth seeing... unless you are very hard up for some barely pg-13 young rob Lowe cleavage. the movie has a good heart but shouldn't be taken seriously by anyone above the age of 16. it was made in the early eighties, takes place in the early sixties, and was written in the mid-sixties. the movie ages well for its heavy load of cheese, but that shouldn't convince anyone to buy it, rent it only if hard pressed between porky's and James and the giant peach. also, though most was filmed in California the Oklahoma scenes are present. the white trash remarks are good but the white trash twang is over done, even if you are like me and come from a family like johnny and pony-boy's... yeah, this movie also leaves the very inspirational name of pony-boy for us to gawk, cherish, and ridicule at the same time. 4/10 rating",The Outsiders

I mean, I know these were considered 'bad seeds' for the period between 1946-1969, but I'd rather see them fighting amongst themselves (as do the Socs and the Greasers) than creating a whole urban crime scene with heroin and crack as the Crips, Bloods and Latin Kings do today. They're so tame by comparison.Maybe I'm just being a concerned mom, but I feel that there's too much of a drug thing these days - and maybe that's why a film like THE OUTSIDERS (along with the book) can still be a nostalgia thing whether you hung around with kids like these or not.

133,Mr_Beale,A Bad Book. An Even Worse Movie.,4,1 May 2002,"﻿Many times, a good book's name is soiled because it is turned into a bad movie. With The Outsiders, a bad book's name was soiled even further because it was turned into an even worse movie.The Outsiders is about Ponyboy Curtis (Howell). He is a member of the Greasers, a gang that often fights with another gang called the Socials (Socs). Both gangs often get into some trouble, but one night a Greaser named Johnny Cade (Macchio) does something really bad and ends up on the run with Ponyboy.I'm sorry if I'm making this movie sound interesting, because it's not. It consists of 91 minutes, each one of them a snore. It tells you about the grievances of each of the characters, but since each character is a complete idiot for keeping up this feud, you really can't sympathize for them.Perhaps the worst aspect of this movie is the 'acting.' Not a single actor is any good. The worst of them is Matt Dillon (Dallas 'Dally' Winston). Normally he's a respectable actor (he was good in Crash, for instant), Whenever Dally begins to cry because he is sad, I begin to cry because I am doubling over with laughter. There's another part of the movie where his inept acting skills begin to shine, but I'm not going to tell you what it is because it would give away the movie's ending. Future big-name actors Tom Cruise (Steve Randall) and Emilion Estivez (Two-Bit Matthews) have small rolls and little chance to show off their talents.A male-dominated movie, the only female with a part that has any significance at all is Diane Lane (Sherri 'Cherry' Valance). Because of this, and the fact that she is a talented actress, it's disappointing to realize that her acting, too, is inept.For someone who's a great director, Coppola sure did a lousy job. The fist-fight scenes are amusingly phoney, and he has Dally put an open pocket knife to his forehead,not because he's suicidal, but because he's deep in thought.",The Outsiders
134,carangi,stunning,10,5 February 2003,"I have not read the book that the movie is based on, so I can't comment on how the movie and book are alike or not, but I have seen the movie and the part of the TV series. As for the TV series: terrible! Don't waste your time on that. But the movie is a different story. It is really nice to see so many talented young actors together, especially because most of them were new to the public and had not (yet) made a name for themselves. Most of the comments on this movie have focused on C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe and Matt Dillon, so I will not comment on them. They are great, don't get me wrong, but I feel that everything has been said already. The most beautiful performance (in my opinion) is given by Ralph Macchio, who seems to get a little forgotten in most reviews. It is hard to believe he was really 21 and 22 years old when the movie was made. He is usually one of those actors of whom people would think he can't do anything besides look cute and play ""some kind of kid"", but trust me, he can really act. He plays Johnny Cade, a scared and troubled 16-year-old who is not wanted at home and who is a member of the ""Greasers"", one of the 2 gangs. The other gang are the ""Socs"", the rich boys who are from the other side of town. Some of Macchio's best scenes are actually the ones in which he is not the key figure. For example, the scene in the movie drive-in where his fellow Greaser Dallas is bothering the 2 girls and the scene in which the Socs follow Johnny, Ponyboy, one of their friends and the 2 girls after they leave the drive-in and Ponyboy and the other Greaser prepare to fight the Socs with a knife and a piece of glass. The part of the movie where Ponyboy and Johnny are staying at the abandoned church is really nice too. The most memorable scenes by Macchio are naturally the ones in which Johnny is the main character, like the scene in which Johnny talks about committing suicide and the scenes that deal with the confrontation with the Socs, Johnny killing one of them and Johnny telling Ponyboy that he ""killed that boy"". The fire scene seems a little odd, but that is just because it is unlogical for it to be in the movie and that has more to do with the script than with any of the boys's acting. Macchio clearly shows he can do more than just ""be cute"". I can really recommend this movie, simply because of the performances of all the young actors, so if you like any of them: go watch this movie, you won't regret it. 8 out of 10!",The Outsiders

This film may not be as striking as the Godfather, but it still holds its own potential. His cast of handsome 'Outsiders', including Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, and Emilio Estevez, were beyond fantastic. Their acting was convincing and witty.This film was based on an award-winning novel written by S.E. Hinton, based on youth overcoming adolescence. In the plot, trouble continuously arises between the two primary groups of social classes known as Greasers or Socials (Socs). The Greasers are the 'Outsiders'. Their reputation is lower-class individuals that are looked down upon in society. The Socials are upper-class, wealthy people that enjoy picking on the misfortune of the Greasers. In the movie, the conflicts are portrayed in numerous combinations of fights and disputes between the two.This is one of those 'love it' or 'hate it' movies. The audience that this movie is commonly shown to are young teenagers that are growing up and preparing for the world.

He does this because earlier in the movie, he saw Ponyboy, Johnny and their friend Two-Bit with his girlfriend. They go to their friend Dally, he gives them money and a gun. They hide in this church, before Dally comes and picks them up. But the church catches on fire, and Ponyboy and Johnny go back to save some kids who got stuck in there. Johnny and Dally are both injured in this, and they are rushed back home, where the greasers and the socs are planning for a large scale gang fight that night. After they win the fight, they go back to find johnny is dying. After he dies, Dally robs a store, but is shot dead by police officers. Then it ends with Ponyboy writing the story as an essay.I read the book in Grade Eight, and while not good, you could still understand what was happening. The movie, fails at that. You need to read the book to understand what the relationship between Ponyboy and his brothers. In the movie it completely glossed over it. Anyway, some of the acting is bad, and feels forced, and there are so many parts of the movie that are unintentionally funny. Some examples: When Ponyboy and Johnny are standing outside of a church, and they are watching a sunrise, there is a orange filter being used. And you can tell because, everything in the shot is orange. Another time is at the end of the movie, when ponyboy is reading Johnny's note, it shows Johnny's face, then after he's done reading, it just zooms in on Johnny's eye, for no reason.There are a bunch of bad shots, like one in the church where it just pans over the church's floor. Also, the pacing of this movie is bad. Everything is rushed, Johnny's death is completely glossed over and they cut out a bunch of stuff. In the beginning of the movie, when Ponyboy is shoved over by his brother Darry, instead of a long dramatic pause, it just quickly cuts to Ponyboy running away. There is music playing over every scene almost. And in the gang war towards the end of the movie, you can't tell who is who. The movie does have some good stuff, like the plot is interesting, Dally's death is well shot, but there are just too many flaws for it to be called a good movie.Final Verdict:5.7/10 A poorly paced mess of a film, with a few redeeming qualities.",The Outsiders
138,trav_yates,Not as bad or good as people say,6,4 April 2021,"Firstly I should note I stumbled across the extended version. Which by most accounts is better than the original 91 minute version. I searched it out after watching The Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe.I agree with some of the 1 star reviews. The acting and dialogue is pretty bad. But only in some spots it's also quite good in others. You have to remember they took the dialogue from some book written in the 60s.But just look at the names in this movie. For a lot of them this was their first big break. Tom Cruise before Risky Business, Ralph Macchio before Karate Kid. Rob Lowe before the sex tape.It's worth 3 stars for that alone. The acting is worth another 2. Add another star for the storyline. You get 6 stars overall.I think if you're fans of movies and a bit nostalgic definitely check it out.",The Outsiders
139,calilove,Good but not great...much better book,7,17 August 2000,"I saw this movie the day after I read the book, and although I found the movie to be interesting and touching, it was largely because of the charismatic cast, particularly Ralph Macchio and Matt Dillon.  I think the movie could have been better if it was about a half hour longer and if the plot was developed more completely.  If I hadn't read the book this movie would have probably left me confused because of the lack of plot development.  Nonetheless, it was entertaining, but the book was much better.  I give the movie a 7/10",The Outsiders
140,summers_child,I loved the Book and Movie,10,30 March 2002,"When I first read the book, I thought it was excellent. Then after reading the book, I decided to watch the movie. The first time I watched it I thought it was horrible, but then I watched it a second time and started realizing what the director was trying to point out. I thought that Coppola left out ALOT of VERY important details, like the first chapter, which wasn't really important but more then some scenes he put in. I also think he could have picked the actors better, not by how they acted (they acted great, but by how they looked, in the book it said Dally was towheaded (blonde) and he had dark brown hair in the movie, and it also said he was ugly and frightening, but I found him pretty good looking, BUT it was played by Matt Dillon.Now I have the movie and have watched it a hundred times, and liking it more every time I see it. I have also read the book over and over, and find it better then the movie. If you are to watch the movie, read the book first because then the film will be easier to understand. I would recommend, both the movie and book to young adults. It was done wonderfully and the actors were great, especially Matt Dillon and Rob Lowe, even though he only had a few lines.",The Outsiders
141,obrien-aaron-515-200389,Poor acting drags down a solid story,4,16 May 2013,"I read S.E Hintons ""The Outsiders"" in school and I loved it, and then we were told we were going to watch the movie adaptation of the book. I found out it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, so obviously my expectations couldn't of been higher. Sadly, the film turned out to be a huge disappointment.The films biggest problem is the acting, the acting problem is almost universal throughout the cast, and although some aren't as bad as others, the ones that count are the ones that are the worst. The only lead actor that has some good moments is Matt Dillon, who plays Dallas, not to say that he doesn't have some bad parts too. The actors drag down scenes that are supposed to have an impact, and I often found myself bursting out in laughter at how cringe worthy it gets in some scenes. Also, when a character isn't well portrayed, it isn't as easy to resonate with them or want to root for them, when they are either being so wooden about everything or being completely over the top.The main reason why I had high expectations for this film was because of Francis Coppola, who directed some of the best films ever made. Disappointingly, he doesn't bring much to the film. What should be standout scenes just feel mundane, and when something is added to a scene for impact,(for example, an overlay of a characters face on top of a scene whilst their narrating a letter they wrote), just feel silly and out of place, like they belong in a cheesy romance movie.In terms of comparison to the book, I thought that the film also never really captured the themes presented in the book as well as it could of, and the film is also lacking something that the made the book so captivating, and that's Ponyboys thoughts throughout the story, I felt that was a really important thing in the book, without it you never really get to know the character as much. I'm aware that most voice over in films is incredibly cheesy and something as cheesy as that is the last thing this film needs, it's just something that only adds to how inferior the film is to the book. I will say that the film is definitely faithful to the book, and it still has the same story that the book has, the problem is that the story is presented so poorly.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film at all. Perhaps if Copolla put more effort into the film, or if the acting wasn't so mediocre, the film would be fine. This isn't the case, though. Key scenes that are supposed to be emotional are nearly impossible to take seriously, the characters are so poorly portrayed that they're hard to sympathize with, and the direction just lacks style and personality.",The Outsiders
142,maestro-45,Coppola Masterful,8,6 August 2007,"The story goes that Coppola did this film and Rumble Fish back to back using same locale and much of the cast. The way that cheapskate Roger Corman used to do with his b c d movies back in the fifties and sixties. The difference is that Coppola can take simple material and spin into gold as in stay gold Ponyboy. His sensibility is very profound and it shows all over this film. When the guys hide out in the church, it reminded me a bit of Charles Laughton's Night of the Hunter, with those kids trying to find sanctuary down the river somewhere. The film becomes allegorical and the extraordinary and young cast is completely believable.",The Outsiders

But my teacher had the crappy 90 min. version. I wanted the extended version! So my mom, being a fan of it as well, ordered the 120 min. version! Anyway, I love it and I know it word for word.

Not only is it a great cast that will never be assembled, but it is a great combination of male angst and 80s acting and directing. It is not a story of good versus evil but is the story of people in social stratification that are both desperately trying to break out. There are scenes in here that perfectly detail male bonding and brotherhood that deserve a good look. Do yourself a favor and spend an afternoon.",The Outsiders

I thought it was a great job by Francis Ford Coppola.  The cinematography was fantastic, the actors were good....mind you, I saw it several times (at least ten) in the theatre and much, much more on video. There is an alternate version, with some additional footage, that was shown on local TV in LA at one point - which I think made the storyline much clearer to the average person.  Despite its flaws, I feel this movie captured what it feels like to be young and from the wrong side of the tracks...I cried at the ending and never cease to watch it whenever it shows up on late-night TV. It also features some great performances by actors that were not as well-known at the time of the movie - Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe, etc.  Check it out for yourself and see if the poetry speaks to your heart as well....",The Outsiders

I had seen the Karate Kid and I thought he was cute(hey I am currently 13. I know that he's way older than me.)and I got on here, INDB, to see what else Ralph had been in. And I discovered the Outsiders. I asked my mom about it and she told me to find the book and read it. So I looked at my school library, found it and read it. Over the weekend, I read it to my friend, and we immedietly became obsessed. We still are. A bunch of high-school kids had to read the book in our town and felt like renting the movie, so we couldn't get it ANYWHERE. One day after another attempt we were at her house while her family was gone. It was a surprise to have my dad knock on the door and I said why are you here, and he held up my grandmother's copy of the Outsiders. We started screaming and popped the movie in. When Ponyboy's face came on and said When I stepped out...we began to scream. We watched it, and the only thing we were disappointed in was they showed no true introduction to show how the Socs treated the greasers, and they didn't show the reason Johnny hated his parents, and the relationship between Darry, Soda, and Ponyboy. But other than that, we LOVED it! Very good movie if you've seen the book. I hope to buy the Director's cut.",The Outsiders
150,psdude,"A good movie that gave many stars their ""Big Break"".",8,20 August 2001,"The Outsiders is still a really good movie. But it will be more remembered for the movie that gave many stars their ""Big Break"". This movie has many famous people as the Greasers, such as: Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estovez, and Patric Swayze. The Outsiders movie is based on S.E. Hintons classic tale of rival gangs, the Socs (the rich kids with all the breaks) and Greasers (the pour kids who are known as trouble makers). The main character is Ponyboy Curtis, no joke, that's his real name! Ponyboy is a Greaser and proud of it. Ponyboy lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop. The plot of The Outsiders thickens when Pony and his Greaser friend Johnny get attacked by Socs. I don't want to spoil everything for you people who never saw this movie, so that's all I'm going to say. If your a fan of the book, the movie version won't dissapoint you!",The Outsiders

I was excited later to learn that a motion picture adaptation was being made and that Coppola was directing it. Later that spring, I saw the movie and was thoroughly disgusted! The movie was cramped and hacked and was a mess. Even though a major part of the junior high school population has read this book, it would have been nice that some care was taken into consideration in making this movie. There was no character development, no explanations of action, no real action! It was suppose to be this ""art film for kids"" and it was a celluloid failure. No knew why Johnny hated his parents; no one knew how the Curtis' became orphans; Soda had a girlfriend who mysteriously left town(she was pregnant with his child);and no one knew why Dallas was the way he was.This movie was terrible and it's all Coppola's fault.",The Outsiders
152,clopzat1,Uneven,6,30 January 2013,"Infamous not only for the stunning amount of future (then unknown) movie stars as for it's uneven direction, ""The Outsiders"", by no means a poor movie, starts fantastically and a third of the way through descends into a mire of corniness and choppy staging from which it is never really able to recover from. It leaves such a bitter taste ( especially for fans of the acclaimed YA novel) I believe because it starts so well, with Francis Ford Coppola's masterful staging of ensemble scenes and a seemingly unstoppable fast pace. It's unfortunately fitting that the film starts with bouncy rock and roll ( with the song ""Gloria"" used to fantastic effect) and then once the plot takes a turn for the dark it seems like Coppola has entrusted his direction with Carmine Coppola's unwieldy and manipulative music score. It's not all bad once you reach the third way point, the scenes with the boys just talking in Ponyboys house really flow, but Coppola rely's a lot on uncharacteristic framing devices like poorly placed jump cuts, shifting aspect ratios, fade ins, and a whole lot of corn. While the dialog is corny during the whole movie it sticks out like a sore thumb for most of the movie while in the opening it kind of fades away with Coppola's playful direction. As far as the acting goes curiosity value makes some of it more bearable then it must have been when the movie was originally released. I shall go one by one.C.Thomas Howell- Ponyboy Curtis- Has a very limited range of expressions and actions, though he was hot stuff for a maybe 3 more years, suffice to say, he is no longer hot stuff. Though he never really has to carry the film except during the sequences at the church where the movie falls apart.Matt Dillon- Dallas- While he is occasionally over the top he is an extremely commanding screen presence and the best actor in the film by far.Ralph Macchio- Johnny- Simply annoying, he manages to make most of his dialog irritating.Patrick Swayze- Darry- Look tough, take off shirt, Say three word line, repeat. His character is way cut down from the book and never manages to seem intimidating.Rob Lowe- Sodapop- Look cute, take off shirt, say one word line, repeat. Unfourtunely Lowe, who tries his best, has about 30 seconds of screen time. His part is extremely cut down from the book.Tom Cruise- Steve- Simply insane. Though Coppola's camera does it's best to ignore him. He isn't really a character as much as a unintentionally amusing ball of energy.",The Outsiders
153,cfstief,Critics were a bit too hard on this one,5,9 June 2015,"OK, I know it's not exactly the BEST film ever made, but it seems to be let down a lot by critics. There are things that must be acknowledged that critics seem to put aside. As you probably all know, this was an adaptation of the S.E. Hinton novel. For a movie that tries to connect to the actual story as much as possible, it does the job well and, as a matter of fact, it's probably the closest adaptation to a novel that I've seen. With adaptations like the Divergent series, which I have read, it doesn't get as close to the book as The Outsiders does, and I know that it's a lot shorter, but it does better than most adaptations I've seen. Critics seem to disregard the fact that it's based off a novel, and it usually sounds like they find it as an original idea that flopped. I won't lie, it IS mediocre if you don't know where it started, and mediocre in general, but Francis Ford Coppola made this movie as a favor for a bunch of middle school students that wanted him to. I'm not saying that critics SHOULD think it should have a chance because of that, I'm just saying, ""What do you expect?"" I'll be honest, like most adaptations go, the book was much better, but I still found the book very simple and it kind of had me disinterested at moments, much like the film. I'm not saying this movie is bad, because it's not, and critics seem to beat it HARD. I just felt like as a film, it came out as mediocre. But as an adaptation of a novel, it works pretty well.",The Outsiders

The disappointment was painful. The acting wandered from flat to melodramatic, with no in between. The characters, who displayed incredible depths in the book, were shallow and whiny. Scenes that moved me to tears in the book left me cold in the film. Scenes that flowed and connected in the book were abrupt and jumpy in the film.

When I finally saw it, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. Although the novel is a very fast-moving story, I thought that some of the scenes in the movie went by just a little too fast, and sometimes the music seemed out of place. I also really disliked the trail scene. It was not at all what I was expecting. Some of the acting was poor in some points as well, but overall, I thought the cast did a good job. I thought that Matt Dillon did an outstanding job as Dallas Winston, though.If you loved S. E. Hinton's book, then I would definitely recommend seeing this, just don't get your hopes up too high. Even if you didn't like the book, although I'm not sure if that is even possible =), I would recommend this movie because of the cast.

You instantly feel connected to the characters and their lives. Francis Ford Coppola followed the book very well and directed a fantastic movie. I would suggest watching the 'Complete Novel'(re-released in 2005) because it contains the extended beginning and extra scenes. S.E Hinton was there during the filming and her imprint shows. Watch for her in Dally's hospital room. I would suggest that you read the book before watching the movie. All in all I find this movie to be exceptionally well made and very well- casted. C.

158,mollymischief,appreciate the vivid imagery,10,1 April 2006,"The Outsiders book and movie are both excellent portrayals of life on the ""other side of the tracks"". I grew up in a much similar situation. Even as a teenager, I appreciated the awesome scenery and vivid imagery shown here. I have become a fan of S. E. Hinton's writing because of this book and movie. I have learned to pay attention to the subtle background effects in movies because of the techniques that Francis Ford Coppola used here. The train whistle blowing is a sound that is heard through out the entire film. That lends an air of realism that most other films just don't have. In today's age of guns and explosives, the rumble in the park is still frightening. It erupts after we learn of the multiple hardships of all of the characters. Of course, everyone in the entire movie has brilliant character moments. To this day, many scenes stick in my mind. Kudos to the acting by the store clerk as Dallas robs the store. This man cringes in sheer terror as Dally puts a handgun to his face, literally shoving it at his cheek as hard as he can. There is a simple scene in the beginning as we learn about Emilio Estevez's character ""Two-bit"". He sits down on the floor intent on eating the entire chocolate cake. It is just really cool moment that adds realism. As a testament to excellent casting, all of the 'outsiders' have had fantastic careers after being cast here.",The Outsiders

I read the book a few years later and couldn't believe how well the movie followed the book.  But let me say, if you love the movie you must read the book--the end adds more detail.This is a very emotional movie about a bunch of tough kids just trying to belong who get caught up in circumstances--sometimes not of their own making.  I loved the way the movie showed the relationship between Ponyboy and his brothers.  It was intense!

161,christopherstrimbu-52434,"Book was great, but this movie.....",1,2 March 2021,"It will be easy to say, ""This movie sucks"" and walk away. The book was good, but movie is trash. Lets run through the list.1. The film starts with Ponyboy writing his assignment, and it starts with the same lines as the book, ""When I stepped out into the the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house."" But then it cuts to to him in the middle of the street in broad daylight.2. They get the casting wrong. Dallas looks like a movie star, yet he is supposed to be that rough gangster. And Two-Bit looks like how Dallas is supposed to look.3. The acting is atrocious. At the scene where Johnny wants change in his life, where he wants no more gangsters and such, I started laughing. Not because I have no feelings, but because the acting is that bad.4. They don't do anything different from the book. Literally. Look at a scene from the movie and you will find it in the book. I expect the movie to be a little different, but no. Even 90% of the lines are ripped directly from the book. Did this movie even have a script?5. No buildup to certain events. In the book, we know that things are tense between Daryl and Ponyboy. So when Ponyboy runs away, it feels natural. Here, just one scene of throwaway dialogue is all we need to build up to the breakup. Ponyboy just feels like an oversensitive clutz. And there is no buildup to Johnny running away either. In the book, we know he has abusive parents. But they don't show or tell us. Also, the scene where they break up is the worstly edited thing I've even seen.6. This brings me to my biggest beef with this movie. If you don't read the book, you will get nothing out of this movie other then pure confusion. If you like this movie, I dare you to watch it again, but in the shoes of someone who has not read the book.7. The connection between any of the characters is never really shown. We know that Johnny means a lot to Dallas in the book. Here, just one throwaway peice of dialogue is all we need. So when Dallas goes crazy when Johnny dies, he comes off as who goes crazy on a whim.8. Speaking of connection, we never do get the rivalry between their gang and the Socs. In the book, we understand the connection between them is and why they hate each other. Here, they just hate each other because they hate each other.9. Another thing is that the fight between them. In the book, it's the climax of their rivalry. Here, there is no buildup (like every other event in this movie) and it just looks like a huge fight between 1st graders. No stakes, no tension, no buildup, no injuries(in the book, the characters get seriously hurt, here, just wipe some blood on their face).10. Another big beef of mine is that they try to create important events in the book, but with no stakes, tension, buildup, or emotion. Key events in the book that are important are put on the big screen, but they feel empty. That's because there is no emotion in it, or anything, really.11. This movie sometimes confused me as well. When Ponyboy and Johnny are at the park setting up the fire, I was thinking, ""Wait, they ran away already?""Anyways, as you figured out, I really hate this movie. My two biggest beefs are the fact that if you didn't read the book, you will get the idea of what pure confusion really means by watching this movie. And the fact that they try to replicate important events from the book while making them feel empty because of no stakes, tension, buildup, or emotion. My advice is throw this movie in the trash and watch something else instead.",The Outsiders

I thought it had so many amazing themes that it was trying to tell you. And a lot of heart wrenching parts. That you have to see to be touched by it. If you like films about friendship, love, being who you think you should be and everything else in that category. This is the movie and book for you. I think that everyone should read the book too.

165,JGH-BR,My all-time favorite movie.,10,31 August 2003,"""The Outsiders"" is my all-time favorite movie.  The cinematography is beautiful, the score gorgeous, the acting excellent, and the writing -- the most important part of any movie that isn't a musical or a travelogue -- first rate.  Put that all together -- with emphasis on the writing -- and it adds up to an extremely entertaining film.  And that is what I want from a movie: entertainment, the opposite of boredom.The great thing about ""The Outsiders"" is that it not only entertains, but it does so in every area.  I'll start with the cinematography.  That isn't something that I normally think about when I see a movie. Here, however, I couldn't not think about it.  Nowhere else have I seen such rich and vibrant landscapes, such exquisite multi-colored sunsets, and even such effective use of shadow and darkness to portray the grittiness of the city. The individual scenes themselves, combined with the interesting contrast between the city and country shots, keep one's eyes glued to the screen.The score isn't quite so gripping, but it is powerful, nonetheless.  The main song, ""Stay Gold,"" sung by Stevie Wonder, is beautifully and painfully sentimental.  And the true score itself is lovely and helps to keep one's emotions at high tension during this emotion-rich film.Regarding the acting, this all-star cast picked from the young Hollywood of the early 1980s is so formidable that even the great, though admittedly not well-known, Tom Cruise is relegated to a minor part. As for the leads, C. Thomas Howell and Ralph Macchio are especially good.  While Howell unfortunately ended up as the king of straight-to-video flops, he is excellent here as the sweet and sensitive Ponyboy Curtis, a smart but poor 14-year-old who is caught between the worlds of the haves and the have-nots. Macchio also turns in a fine performance as Ponyboy's friend Johnny Cade. His southwestern accent is so good you'd think he was actually from Oklahoma.Of course it really all comes down to the writing, and ""The Outsiders"" most definitely scores here as well.  The story pulls you in from the beginning and never lets you go.  And the dialogue, even the unimportant small talk, is incredibly natural.  This is especially true in a scene involving a haircut.  The one flaw I find -- and this is really an editing mistake -- is the absence of a scene necessary to conclude a key element of the main storyline.  The scene was filmed, and used to be included when the movie was shown on broadcast television.  I can't understand why it was left out of the theatrical version.The omission of the scene shows that ""The Outsiders"" isn't perfect; but a movie doesn't have to be perfect in order to get a ten.  It merely needs to be excellent.  For all the reasons I've given, this movie is precisely that.",The Outsiders
166,anma,The new version is even better,10,25 November 2006,"I just recently picked up the new version of this movie. A lot of people didn't like it because they claimed FFC messed with the music score. Well, he did but in a good way. Yes I liked it. His father is probably rolling in his grave about the change but like I said the change was good. It is now my favorite version of the film. It also brings Sodapop more into the story than the original cut did back in 1983. Which I know Rob Lowe is very happy about. It also shows you how Ponyboy gets that mark on his throat. I was always wondering about that when I watched the original. It's closer to the novel by Hinton than the original cut. Two thumbs up Francis.",The Outsiders
167,misterdo-1,Father knows best !,1,24 September 2005,"The heart of a movie is the ""music"", the fuel that gets the motor running which drives our passions and makes us speed along that long highway of life, without it, we are empty, neutral and in the end get nowhere! That is what Mr. Coppola did to this once masterpiece work of art. I mean when I saw that a new edition was due out, sometime back in July 05', I thought to myself, WOW! Now there's something interesting, I mean hey, I too was of that crowd, having read The Outsiders novel back in my teens in the late seventies in English composition class.But what a total disappointment ! O.K. I grant that Mr. Coppola did bring more depth and insight into the characters, setting the stage, to how the story would develop. Trying to stay faithful to the novel, I liked the premise of somehow altering the story line.But why, Mr. Coppola did you have to sever the heart of this classic movie, the original musical score written by your father, the late Carmine Coppola, that was in my honest opinion superior, which helped us develop a bond that gave us empathy for the characters.I mean, hey, they were from the Eastside, the place where the underprivileged, needy people live amidst poverty, desolation, confusion and despair.Wasn't it hard enough on the characters to live that way, without having you come along and sever the soul of this movie and replace it with edgy and reckless tunes, with little or no passion left for them in the end ? When I saw the catchy phrase New Soundtrack, I cringed for a moment, but then thought that maybe with the technology of today, he could've refined the music.An example would be Halloween H20, I must tip my hat off to the cat that remastered the original soundtrack by the great John Carpenter. Especially with the intro piece, it had depth and heart and that kept me glued to the screen. But, on another note, Coppola quoting that Rob Lowe was androgynous, was far fetched, and it is not his person who makes the film look the way it is, but the newer scenes added, I felt uncomfortable with most of them and found that it showed some very subtle and eerie overtones of homosexuality.In the era which we live, where this is no longer hidden, and has now become accepted by ""society"", and an ""alternative"" to ""some"" you'll understand what I mean and most assuredly be left with that impression.I felt that maybe Coppola pulled out those scenes for a reason, so that the movie could relate to the crowds of that era, and not lose a bigger following that in the end would fail at the box office.So to please the censors of the times, I guess he probably got hasty when it came to final editing and in the end he left us with a masterpiece that would keep us endeared for many years to come !But it makes me feel sad for the actors, who with hard work are where they are today. Don't you remember that infamous lie that circulated a few years back on Tom Cruise's sexual orientation ? So, why, then did Coppola bring up this subject? To jeopardize the career of others and stir old demons back to life ? And after having seen the 2005 version, sometimes I wonder why the rest of the cast wasn't at the screening ? Previous engagements, occupations of life ? Or did they already know, the rumors had leaked out over the net about the 2005 version ?Cause as I watched the extras on the second DVD, I found it quite evident, somehow you could see it on the faces of the actors, that utter disappointment! Maybe Mr. Coppola lured them into this screening by jet flying them from L.A. to Oklahoma and reminiscing them with objects of the past that made the movie and then topping it off with a good old home styled meal to back this horrible rendition !Whatever the reason, I sure am happy to have kept the Original 1983 version which is, in my honest opinion superior to that of the 2005 one which lacks that very essence, the passion and soul of the movie ""The Original Soundtrack"" that the late Carmine Coppola composed with love and which will always be remembered for many years to come the core and heart of ""The Outsiders"" of.......1983.",The Outsiders
168,YoullNeverSeeMeAgain,Awesome Movie! (My comment only has a tiny spoiler),10,25 January 2005,"I read the book and I was so into it that it only took me 1 and a half days to read! It was Everything a movie could be Sad happy, It even had me on the edge of my seet at some points. Nothing beats the book but I'll tell you this had the best dialog I've seen in my entire life! In the end when ponyboy is reading the note that Johnny wrote I couldn't take it, I was just so sad, I cried out loud when my sister and my dad were sitting write there. Anyone who doesn't see at least one good thing in this movie doesn't look hard enough. I've seen people calling it lame and other names that don't fit no matter how you put it. Dalley was played by an awesome actor, (I still can't remember that guys name!) Now moving up to number 1 on my favorite movie list. For those who saw absolutely no talent or story, I hope my comment changes some of your minds",The Outsiders
169,degrazio7,New 2 disk The Complete Novel version,10,21 September 2005,"I am a huge fan of this movie and like many others out there, reading the novel in high school back in the 70's was required. I own the previously released original theatrical version on DVD which continues to this day to be shown in schools throughout the country. I now own the newly released 2 disk set. My hat is off to Mr. Coppola for finally rounding out the story with added scenes that bring much more depth, meaning and passion to the story which, this time around, truly does the book justice. The added scenes are necessary and vital to the scope of the story and Mr. Coppola explains on this new version why the scenes were deleted, removed, whatever, in the first place. For instance, if one has never read the book and saw the movie, one would never know how Pony Boy Curtis received that nasty little cut on his neck. The Complete Novel version shows Pony Boy getting bladed by Socs in the very beginning. The somewhat dream-like court sequence has also been added toward the end which explains how Pony Boy was cleared of the murder rap. Other scenes, such as the two described which have been added will give the viewer the light-bulb-over-the-head experience as if to say, Ohhhhh now I get it! In addition to the added scenes, a new Rockabilly style soundtrack (including songs by Elvis) have been added in place of the background orchestration. The new soundtrack may leave viewers flat during some places in the movie, especially if they know the original version's beautiful score that have enriched some key emotional scenes. However, the new soundtrack grew on me. Thankfully, Stevie Wonder's beautifully sung theme song, ""Stay Gold"" is still in the beginning and end credits. In the new version, the theme song is played lightly in the stylized sunrise scene with Pony Boy and Johnny. Or is it a sunset? I was never sure because Pony Boy states that he woke ""earlier than usual"" one morning and next you see him standing at the top of a hill joined by Johnny watching what appears to be a sunrise at which point Pony Boy recites the now famous poem by Robert Frost. In any case, the theme song has been added beautifully to this scene and yet was excluded in the sunset scene in which Cherry gives Two-Bit and Pony Boy a report on the upcoming rumble with the Socs. Minor changes one can live with. Mr. Coppola's new version is a new instant classic. Reborn, better than the theatrical version and it certainly packs all of the emotion penned in the classic novel so many teens have come to love. If you are a fan of the movie, you owe it to yourself to see The Complete Novel version. If you have never seen The Outsiders, you are in for an experience and a chance to see some very young and promising stars such as C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Swayze, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Ralph Macchio, and my favorite actress, Diane Lane in some great meaty roles done to young teen angst perfection. Francis Ford Coppola has said that he wanted to create an epic for kids. What he has accomplished is an epic for the kid in all of us as he rekindles the memories of teen joy, anger, fear, anxiety and trying to fit into our society no matter what generation we are from. Ten stars for this great addition to my DVD library. Mr. Coppola...you did it! You made your well loved classic even better.",The Outsiders
170,gonzalez1960-1,"Forget the movie, read the book!",2,12 August 2009,"After reading other comments that said the movie was true to the book I was excited to finally see it. What a waste of time! So much of the book was left out of the story, there was no character development, and the actors delivered their lines as though they were reading them for the first time. I firmly believe those reviewers who claim this is a faithful adaptation have never seen, let alone read, the book.The story (is supposed) to start with Ponyboy Curtis coming out of a movie theater and thinking, ""When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home."" Even the simplicity of this beginning was ruined in the movie when the first scene shows Ponyboy sitting at a desk writing these words . . . except he didn't even finish the thought! He didn't even mention Paul Newman or a ride. Basically, the beginning of the movie gave away the end. As you're watching the movie you already know it's a story written by Ponyboy. However, we never find out WHY he's writing it! If you read the book, you don't find this out until the very end. Oh, and in the book you DO find out why he's writing the story and how he got to that point in his life. After this pathetic beginning the story goes down from there and has little quality to redeem it.""The Outsiders"" is my all-time favorite book. I've probably read it a couple of dozen times in the last 30 years. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess of a movie and enjoy the real thing.",The Outsiders
171,BradleyPlausse,How?,3,17 June 2014,"I was incredibly skeptical about this movie until the opening credits. Matt Dillion, Ralph Mucchio, and Patrick Swayze? This is a movie I can get behind. The star of my favorite TV show, Rob Lowe?! This movie gets better and better. Tom Cruise?!! This cast is amazing! Then I learned that this movie was directed by the same man who directed one of my favorite movies of all time, Francis Ford Coppola. Yes, the same man who directed the Godfather trilogy (or duo-logy depending on who you ask) and Apocalypse Now is the director The Outsiders. I was so on board with this movie. The movie starts, and for the next 91 minutes the only question that is running through my head is ""How?"" How did this happen? How could talent this great be so underutilized? How could Francis Ford Coppola, the film-god who has 6 Oscars, take such a beloved story and butcher it like this? How? The movie is an almost word-for-word retelling of the book by S.E. Hilton. And hey, if it ain't broke don't fix it. But the tone of this movie makes me sick. This movie will go from ""look how much fun this story is"" to ""this is the part where you should be sad"" in a matter of seconds. An example of this film's bipolar-ness is when (this isn't a spoiler) Darry, played by Patrick Swayze, hits Ponyboy I started to laugh. In the book, this is one of the most serious parts. But the bad acting, odd camera placement, and the obnoxiously loud trumpet, immediately after the hit made me laugh. In the book, the three characters in the scene are speechless when Darry hits Pony. Speechless! And in the movie, it was comedic. Ralph Mucchio is so poorly directed that I honestly think that he didn't know what he was saying. His emotional scenes are so unbelievable that it's humorous. Tom Cruise is so unseen that until I looked it up, I had no idea which character he was playing. Not only did this movie bomb, but it brought down my opinion of the book too. I'm giving The Outsiders a generous 4/10.",The Outsiders
172,rydwyer816,Classic,10,29 September 2014,"The Outsiders was mandatory for me to read when i was in seventh grade, and I immediately fell in love with it. I was completely attached to the characters and their struggles as if i was there with them. I was excited to see the movie adaption and it sure did not disappoint. Already seeing that it was directed by the legend, Francis Ford Coppola, i knew it was going to be a good one. The movie was a completely perfect adaption from the book, almost word for word. I have never seen a movie that is that closely similar to the book. Ever.The movie centers around a group of troubled teens and the daily struggles they have to go through. It's a coming of age movie that really leaves an impact on you.The directors type of cinematography really completes the movie, from the lighting during the sunrise scene or the angles from the murder scene, it all comes together and works beautifully.The cast includes Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane. All who ended up right into fame. Their individual performances were engaging and the all around casting was great and they all worked well together.I've read the book about 8 times and seen the movie so many times I've lost count. I do not have one bad thing to say about either. It's a classic and i recommend the movie to everyone of all ages.",The Outsiders

I first read the book in grade 9 and we watched the movie soon after. I immediately became obsessed with it, as all of my friends can tell you. I love the whole story of it. The friendships, like Pony and Johnny, and the relationship between Sodapop and Ponyboy as brothers. There were many touching scenes, and the new version has many new and improved ones. My favorites include the scene when Soda runs away. I thought it was brilliantly acted and I'm very glad they put it back in the movie. Dally's death scene was also improved and is more dramatic now, and the last scene when Pony is reading Johnny's letter always gets to me. The all star cast was a great asset to this film and I would recommend it to anyone in a heart beat.Jess",The Outsiders

Despite overdramatized acting and a rough flow between scenes, the story was enough to carry this movie. The story was well portrayed and the effects matched the content of the story, but some highly relevant sequences were left out of the movie that made it difficult to follow at some points, The first time watching this movie, I was disappointed and felt it undermined what was a very elegant story. After watching it multiple times, the movie and it's actors have grown on me and I have begun to enjoy it more.

I mean, even if the whole thing is archetypal, it's still difficult to watch. Guys hugging each other, crying to each other, lots of over-the-top melodramatic behavior... I'd get it if it was tongue-in-cheek but as far as I can tell, this isn't; I'm not saying it should be a straight-up parody like Cry Baby, but despite the obvious self-awareness and on-purpose stereotypes it really seems like Warriors in a different context. I mean it does not seem sarcastic... but then how can one take this seriously? This does not look like an gangsploitation film either. I guess, it was an attempt at pop-art... kind of like what Tarantino does, taking old B movies, chop 'em, paste 'em into a film festival film. But again, that's not how it ""reads"". It is this vagueness that leaves me confused and ruins the experience.However, if you do have some sentimental attachment to it and you do like films about two social forces pinned against each other but at the end we realize it's about individuals, not social groups... then I get it.",The Outsiders

There are no stereotyped characters ; they all have reasons & meanings for why they act the way they do. A rivalry between 2 groups of people & a rivalry inside a broken family help keep this movie interesting.Even though it is an old movie, it is touching the new hearts of millions. A must see if i do say so myself. it makes you laugh, cry & hit yourself in the face. Ponyboy, the youngest of the Curtis brothers, & johnny, the gang's pet, have an adventurous escapade, losing lives, saving lives, & improving their own.

This scene gives the movie such an energetic kick start rather than going right into Stevie Wonder's "" Stay Gold."" The acting is amazing and realistic to the core.

I watched the original cut of the movie not long after and was extremely disappointed. So much was cut out that it made very little sense, and the music added doom and gloom to the already dramatic story making it like a Soap. I was amazed even at that young age that a great director like Francis Ford Coppola could have made something that seemed like a bad made for TV movie!The Complete Novel is what I expected when I watched it years ago. All the scenes that I loved were put back and the story flowed like it should have, the oldies rock and roll fit the feel of the movie perfectly. It's amazing that a train wreck could be turned into a great movie by just adding a half an hour worth of footage and trading orchestras for Elvis.The only complaint that I have now is a small part of Matt Dillon's performance. He was fantastic, don't get me wrong, he did Dallas justice for the most part. Let's be honest, you say ""The Outsiders"" seven times out of ten someone will say ""Let's do it for Johnny!"" The only problem: (and if you haven't seen the movie or read the book stop reading now) His death scene drives me nuts, I'm not a stickler for ""true to every detail in the book"" kind of person, but Matt Dillon crawling on the ground gaging, just made me think of an old Bugs Bunny cartoon and really took me out of a moment that is so important.

I also learned nothing had changed and that kind of violence is still happening today. I though it was such a wonderful book, I went on and read all of S.E. Hinton's books.

The beginning cut out probably 3 chapters at least, all the parts that were suppose to be sad were REALLY FUNNY because when Johnny stabbed Bob (the most retarded thing I've ever seen because the blood looked REALLY FAKE) he and Pony boy said this, (uhh you really killed him didn't you Johnny"" ""Yea I did"" and they said that with absolutely no expression at all. And when Johnny started to cry and starting to say I wish there were no Socs or Greasers, NOTHING BAD EVEN HAPPENED, I was not even convinced it was even bad, it looked like he started crying for no reason.The only decent part of the movie was the ""Big Rumble"" which was bad anyway. The church o my sweat Jesus the church, the director decided that he should cut out all the thrilling sensation that the church had in the book and turned it into the biggest bullshit I've seen.In short this movie sucks, and to all those people that think even for a second that the acting is good all I have to say is WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU.",The Outsiders

They cast people that are really irritating for the main roles and they got the descriptions all messed up. I guess I might have liked it better if I hadn't read the book, but it was still annoying.

192,Cherry6776,Watch the uncut version first!,10,1 April 2009,"I read the book for the first time in 8th grade English this year. I immediately fell in love with the characters and the story, so I had to watch the movie. Whether you are watching this for the first time or the 100th time I recommend that you watch the newer uncut version! The whole movie is on Youtube.com, if you are renting or buying the movie make sure it says 114 minutes long not 91 minutes long. This version makes A LOT more sense! I watched the movie for the first time on Youtube and it became my favorite movie. I went to the video store and ordered it, but when it arrived I was surprised to see that they had cut out the whole opening scene (not to mention almost all of my other small but favorite parts). This version also has better music - all sung by Elvis Presly =D.Anyone who has not seen this version should not make any comments because you don't know what you're talking about...anyone who has seen this version and doesn't like it, well you're an idiot and I don't care XD",The Outsiders

I thought it was better than the popular, Twilight by a mile. I saw the movie and cried my eyes out like I did while I was reading it. This movie and book is so real and the teenagers act like teenagers. It's not like Hannah Montana or some other kid's T. V. show, where the teenagers act like kids. It's real. There are real problems that really do happen to some people. The only thing that bug me is that I just wish Johnny and Dally didn't die. I love those characters the most. I cried in school, watching the movie for the millionth time. I even clapped at the end. I own the movie now and watch it all the time. Everyone always says, ""This is my favorite movie"" right after they see something new at the theaters. I can say that about this movie, knowing 20 years from now, it will be true.",The Outsiders

Based on the novel by S.E. Hinton and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the movie is well known for casting future stars namely, C. Thomas Howell, Emilio Estevez, Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Diane Lane and Rob Lowe.The Socs are rich kids who live in the south side of town whereas Greasers are mostly middle working class and poor kids who are from the other side of town. After an incident, the rivalry quickly escalates and they must face off each other for a final time which determines who really ""owns"" the town and also the fate of everyone involved.",The Outsiders
195,samanthameerasiva,"I wouldn't call it a ""must see""...",6,26 December 2011,"The premise was interesting and I was instantly drawn into watching 'The Outsiders'(It also has Matt Dillon). However the execution was not up to scratch; the acting felt contrived and speech felt false and at times unbelievable. Though these did bug me, I really enjoyed the film and the chemistry between the actors and well the idea. The characters were empathy worthy however I wished that the relationships between the brothers were developed further. I do have to admit that I have not read the novel so I don't know if it is an accurate adaptation (etc. etc.) I did enjoy it, I'm sure a lot of people did, but I would not say that you have to see it, that your life would change because of it or that the characters would stay in your heart. Although the names Ponyboy and Sodapop are pretty amazing. I really wished the characters were all developed a little, and that Karate Kid's (Ralph Macchio) acting was better - it was painful at times. All in all, pretty good... not unbearable. It is understandable why many see 'The Outsiders' as an 80's classic, and well, I much prefer it to 'The Breakfast Club'.",The Outsiders

199,chelzm,The movie and the book are great!,10,12 July 2004,OH MY GOD! This movie is like...my favorite! I cried when Johnny died! Then I just completely lost it when Dally died! He is the best! The title represents the movie very well. Since it is about a group of seven teenage guys who feel left out in the world! I read the book for a school project a few years ago and I thought it would suck! But to my surprise...it didn't! Then my teacher told me that the movie wasn't that good and to my surprise once again...it was awesome! I told him this and he was so surprised that I thought the book and the movie were good since I am not the type of student that will like stuff like this! What I mean by that is books and movies made a long time ago about something that was happening a long time ago!,The Outsiders
200,taurus42791,"Somewhat enjoyable, but still destroyed the book.",4,22 December 2004,"Although the movie was likable in some ways, I found it a bit too vague and boring. However, I guess I feel this way because I had read the book previous to it. The book was truly amazing and no movie would ever be able to compete with it.The movie is the basic review of the novel and has the same themes and contents, yet I found it very hard to love. I felt it was too uninteresting, and didn't show enough of the characters personalities. Where was the sweet Ponyboy, I found in the book, in the movie? The Ponyboy in the motion picture didn't show the intelligent and sensitive side. What I saw instead was a chain-smoker with no life.Johnny wasn't horribly portrayed, but I still felt more emotion could have been added to show the lost puppy within him.Something else that had bothered me was how fast-paced the movie was. It didn't give enough time for the viewers to consume what was happening or for the characters to actually act out the natural paces of real life.For example, when Darry hit Ponyboy. Ponyboy didn't seem to consume what was happening, as he did in the book, and just ran out of the house. I mean, wouldn't your brain stop if your older brother had hit you? I know mine would have.Also, the script bothered me greatly. The words coming out of the characters mouths didn't seem to fit in. The actors looked almost awkward saying them, as if they themselves knew how corny and odd the script sounded.And if that weren't enough, I felt there wasn't enough of the other characters such as Sodapop, Steve, Two-Bit, or Darry in the movie. There wasn't much to show each characters relationship with the other. I mean, Sodapop was the only person Ponyboy felt loved by, yet you only see them in the beginning for a very short time and little bits, such as the hospital and rumble scene, afterward. I probably wouldn't have understood their relationship if it weren't for the book.So overall, I felt that this movie was not best fit to represent the book, but good fun if you hadn't read the book.** out of *****",The Outsiders
201,iluvpink8,Staying gold after all these years.,10,16 August 2006,"I guess you might have heard that you have to ba a certain kind of person to like this movie. There is no sex, and nothing blows up, but there is a great message. It was just in May when our teacher had us read this book, and I knew that I would love this movie. My teacher showed us the older version in our class,and I fell in love with it. While most of the students disliked it, but I wanted to buy it. So i was determined to buy the Two Disk DVD. Which I did, and I was not disappointed. C.Thomas Howell portrays Ponyboy Curtis is such a great ways. (Not as hot as Soda, and not as strong as Darry.) He has enough emotion to make you feel what the characters going through. Matt Dillon is nothing short of brilliant delivering the class line. ""Lets do it for Johnny."" Ralph Macchio Holy crud he was 20 when he was in this, but I guess it landed him the role as Johnny cade with his sweet face. Diane Lane as Cherry was great she was so pretty. Rob Lowe must be happy to know that his extra sences were added in the extended version, which showed some good acting that wasn't seen in the original. Patrick Swayze was good as tough Darry, and of course Emilio Estevez, and Tom Cruise cough as Steve, who was good in his youth. The message stay gold is a great one for people of all ages, the cinematography was also excellent. I personally like the new score it gives the movie more of an edge and makes the corny parts not so corny, except for the surfer music. The term boys don't cry is not used in this movie. It teaches us that when worst comes to worse even a tough guys gotta cry. all in all great movie great acting, great message. A forgotten movie of the 80s.",The Outsiders

Scripting was weak, dialogue forced, art direction seemed...romantic, music did not fit the setting and some of the worst direction I have ever witnessed.

The first time I watched it I cried and I actually still cry. The movie is not as good as the book but then again what movie is.

My two classes of seventh graders read it, and we watched the movie today. They all enjoyed it, but most preferred the book. The actors did a uniformly fine job of portraying so complex characters. My favorite portrayals were Swayze as Darry, Estevez as ""Two-Bit"", and Rob Lowe as Soda. And, of course, you have to like Diane Lane (then and now).The movie left out at least one important scene, that of the courtroom right at the end. It did seem to be edited a little choppily. I'd like to see the whole cut.So run out and rent it. You might find it already rented, we had to go to three places to find one where it wasn't already rented.John",The Outsiders

210,kween_b_701,from me,10,1 April 2006,"Hey everybody. I too have read this book and watched the movie. The outsiders was a touching yet disturbing story of some kids who had major hardships and not very many rules. It was disturbing in the sense that people such as the Socs, actually treated others less fortunate than them in such a manner. The fact that people still treat others that way is disgusting. When Johnny died, it was tear jerking because I truly felt a connection with him.. As I grew my parents too were drunks and they beat me but I got over it. The sad thing is he didn't get a chance to. Dally dying was not a surprise, because Johnny was the only one he really cared about and in a sense johnny was like his little brother. No one in the gang quite felt that way towards each other. This book , you could say kind of changed the way I look at others with more or less money than me. I feel equal with them.

I love how this movie was a book before, and turned out awesome, maybe even better than the book. In the Outsiders special addition 2-disk set, they show scenes from the movie that were cut out from the original tape, but they show you them added to the movie.

The only thing is, that i suggest that you read the book before you watch the movie. The book contains more of Ponyboys ( the main characters ) thoughts and it spends time to let you understand the characters fully unlike the movie. The only thing is is that the movie goes by really fast and certain parts that were very important were only briefly talked about in the movie. The movie really related to the book and sometimes had word for word duologue. This is my all time favorite movie i have ever seen.

I recommend The Outsiders to anyone who wants a good read or a good movie because, man, this story is so real only an alien couldn't relate to it. It's no surprise to me that half the cast went on to be A-list actors. I will say though that if you want the full experience, read the book first. It'll just make more sense. Also, Johnny was PERFECT, a million thumbs up to Ralph Macchio for that amazing performance. IT must have been hard though because he was twenty something playing a sixteen year old. Please please see the movie and read the book not only for you but for S. E. Hinton, this book is terrific as well as the movie.

Poor Ralph Macchio -- I think he went on to make THE KARATE KID so he could defend himself against the awful acting karma this film cursed him with for the rest of his career.

I think they uttered a grand total of ten lines between them throughout the whole film. Ironically enough, the only moments in this entire 91-minute apocalyptic offense against filmmaking WERE those ten lines uttered by Tom and Rob. Their *mesmerizing* arm-wrestling scene was the only spark of creative chemistry in the entirety of this abomination.

Please -- get thee to a video store and rent THE GODFATHER (Parts I & II), APOCALYPSE NOW, and DRACULA (watch Gary Oldman -- a REAL actor). These films will reveal to you what a Coppola film REALLY is.

Most of it is what you imagine it to be, so if you ever want a good book or movie to watch, I'd recommend the Outsiders as it is one of the best books ever written and the best movie ever made!",The Outsiders
234,snowgirlsf,The Greatest Film of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,15 January 2002,The Outsiders was truly the greatest movie of all time. I thought the actors did an extremely good job. They showed emotions at all the right times and really knew how to act. I felt like I was actually there with them and when characters died I found myself feeling so sad I was bawling. It shows a perfect example of the struggles between rich and poor kids and the struggles they go through in life The book was great too. I recommend both and give the movie 5 stars(*****),The Outsiders
235,cailyn725,I loved it,10,1 July 2007,"I loved this movie! It was the best and now my favorite movie! And i love most of the actors. Especially Dally and Sodapop!(: I hope that the director of the outsiders or maybe even a new one would make a new outsiders for 2007 or 2008 so we can see what it is like now! This movie was so sad and i cried when Johnny and Dally died. The director made the movie look so real and so original. I was wondering one thing, Does S.E. Hinton (the one who wrote the book The Outsiders) really in the movie? And if she could read this I would want her to know that I didn't just love the movie, I loved the book too! I always watch the movie with my friends and we all love it. I first saw it with my school after we read the book. It was actually about 2 or 3 weeks ago! So now i've seen it 3 times and i'm probably going to see it again! I have another question, how can i buy the movie with the deleted scenes? I've always thought that maybe if I bought it in a movie store it would have the deleted scenes in it but it didn't.",The Outsiders
236,JonVanya,American Classic,10,28 February 2008,"The book was required reading in school. I remember thinking that the ""guy"" that wrote The Outsiders was amazing. How could he capture the era so perfectly I wondered. Then I drew the conclusion that the Author must be one the characters in the book. I was very wrong. When I found out that S.E. Hinton was a young teenage girl, I was more than shocked. Amazing insight to the world of teenage poverty stricken boys. I feel that the movie did as much justice to a book that could be done. The flavor of the era was still present in the film. There were a few things that were left out but, all in all, I highly recommend this movie even if you have read the book.",The Outsiders

I am on the 11th chapter and i have to say this is one of the best books i ever read! I was so sad when... well someone died i cant wait to see the movie! I'd have to say my favorite characters are Johnny, Sodapop, Ponyboy, and Dally. When I first heard we were going to read this book i was like, ""well OK i guess... i don't really want to the book sounds lame"" but now my opinion has Definitely changed! this is one of those books i want to go out and buy and read over and over. It is so good! I am a young teenager and it scares my parents when i say i want to stay inside and read this book instead of going out and shooting hoops or something!

Although I was impressed with the acting and directing this film did not really include some parts in the book that I found important. Also Tom Cruise supposedly ""starred"" in this movie but yet I saw him like, once, and I didn't even know it was him. C.Thomas Howell and Matt Dillon did beyond belief acting in beyond belief roles. But I felt the real shining star was Ralph Macchio, I have always loved Macchio (Karate Kid, etc..) but his part (the role of Johnny Cade) was a hard one to master and he did it perfectly. The movie is great, but the book is greatest! ****/*****",The Outsiders
240,gthec9909,"Entertaining, but fundamentally flawed.",5,10 October 2010,"I am a huge fan of the outsiders book, and was excited to hear that there was a movie. Unfortuanutly, it's riddled with continuity errors, poor acting, horrid music, extreme corniness, and a general feeling of cheap film making. Let's talk about the story, shall we? One of the best parts about the book was the excellent story. It's about a poor greaser named- wait for it- Ponyboy. I'm dead serious. Any way, like I said, Ponys a greaser. He puts grease in his hair, he likes cars, he's poor, wares black leather, you know the story. Him and his greasy friends- named Steve, Johny, Two bit, Dally and his 2 brothers- Darry, and best of all- Soda-pop- are constantly getting jumped by ""Socs""- Rich kids who think there better then every better. But then, things are taken too far. Johny kills one of the Socs. This leads to a whole string of events and things are strung together quite nicely. Now, this is a pretty star studded movie- Tom Cruise, Pactric Swayze. Emilio Estevaz. Unfortuanutly, all this Talent is still developing, there all young and it shows. At one point, Ponyboy is actually laughing directly at the camera. Overall, it's a decent film, but the book is A lot better.",The Outsiders

When I read the book I wasn't too excited because as a child in middle school your just not into the whole reading thing (well i wasn't anyway). But then my class watched the movie and it was dead-on to the book. So then i started to compare the two and i started to appreciate the book more because without it i would have been totally lost while watching the movie because it didn't really interest me at first either having a storyline with all the main characters being guys and i was just a 12-13 year old girl. Now i'm 17 almost 18, out of school and i watch the movie every time it comes on TV (on the Spike channel).Also my teacher let my class and i in on a little secret: THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK PLAYED A NURSE IN THE MOVIE, SHE WAS THE 2ND NURSE, THE SKINNY ONE.",The Outsiders
242,litmissusa,classic heartfelt film,10,20 July 2009,"first of all I would just like to say that whoever posted any distasteful comments about this film obviously does,nt know a good film when they see one. this is my favorite movie because it has all of the really good and really cute actors in it. and I also really love the emotion and the action in it. my favorite character is johnny cade played by my favorite actor ralph macchio. I like how he's this sweet shy kid who's been abused by his parents (that I don't like). and the gang really loves him and their always there for him; that's what makes the outsiders a great film they share a special bond and their like family. I remember I watched this when I was in the 7th grade. when I first heard the song ""stay gold."" I fell in love with it already. but I don't really like how they changed some of the original music in some of the scenes; it just took away the mood.",The Outsiders
243,cmmsite,Brilliant!,10,30 December 2003,"The Outsiders is a great adaptation of S.E Hinton's wonderful (and heart-breaking) novel. The film is a piece of art. It's got a good, solid story, beautiful photography, convincing acting by the leading actors and a nice score.It's a star-packed film with appearances by Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze among others. (Not to mention it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola!)    But I was most amazed by C. Thomas Howell's portrayal of Ponyboy Curtis, the central character of the novel and film, who did a great job carrying the story. There are many scenes in the film that are exactly like the book, even following the same dialogue. Usually I don't think that's a good thing since I like to see someone else's interpretation, another one's point of view instead of a copy of the book.  But Coppola masters everything beautifully anyway so it never gets boring and C. Thomas Howell's interpretation of his role is what makes the film stand on its own.Thanks to Howell there are many memorable Ponyboy moments. One of those is Ponyboy's recital of Robert Frost's 'Nothing Gold can stay', which is a scene that stays with you forever. Another actor who caught my attention in this film was Emilio Estevez who plays Two-Bit Mathews, friend of the Curtis brothers and a greaser. Estevez lights up every scene he's in and the film wouldn't be as great without him. There are only two things I don't like about the film: The greasers are too well-groomed and clean and the socs are a too one-dimensional.",The Outsiders

The picture said it was from the movie outsiders, so I decided to watch it. I thought it was going to be stupid but it was absolutely amazing and I fell in love with the greasers (especially Ponyboy) The acting was miraculous.I own 2 different copies of this movie (yeah its that amazing) and I was obsessed with this film for a very long time (still am).

245,kevinmklein,"Awesome Book, Average Film",5,22 May 2007,"Our year-11 English class read the book _The Outsiders_, then watched the film. The amount of detail describing the characters in the book, as well as their realistic dialogue, made them easier to relate to than the ""daggy"" acting jobs by a talented yet nervously young cast.We felt that the book's scenes that were not shown in the 1983 version of the movie, such as SodaPop's clowning around at the hospital and Pony's denial of Johnny's death, robbed these characters of a depth that engaged us as readers. Also, the film's ending came across as too tidy, too clichéd, when compared to the book's.In terms of music and choreography, we felt the score was simply too orchestrally melodramatic, especially by today's standards. ""Gloria"" by Van Morrison was a good choice to represent the Greasers, but Stevie Wonder's ""Stay Gold"" ballad as a theme was overly sensitive for these tough yet emotionally raw kids. The rumble scene, which was the climax of the film, needed some improved acting to carry the emotional impact of its significance to the plot.Also, in Johnny and Pony's pivotal scene by the church, the golden sunrise backdrop was distractingly fake. Sure, it may have been reminiscent of the film version of _Gone with the Wind_, but a teen audience, both now and in 1983, would hardly appreciate the reference.Overall, the book was easier for us to relate to, even here in Perth, Australia, in 2007. We could visualise it happening in our neighbourhoods, to our friends. We'd definitely recommend that people read the book first before watching the film, as the film's ending is premature and too neat compared with the book, and readers may lose interest in the rest of the book's story, which is more important for characterization than plot development.Mr Klein's Year 11 English Class -- Prendiville Catholic College",The Outsiders

At least thats what I got out of it. The actors did a great job portaring their characters,and it was a good movie. Good not great.The portrayed the major plot line of the story and stuck to it. They did a good job with this, its just that there was so much more to the book. Little things that strayed from the major plot but were important to the story.

It gave the impression that for each scene the actors had quickly read the relevant page of the book, put it down and said 'OK, lets have a try at that then' The dialogue doesn't flow at all, there's NO concept of understated cool (they were a 'tuff' gang with hidden depths in the book, they just whinge and whine in this) in fact the motto seems to be 'If in doubt, add more angst....and more!' Plus major actions or character traits are not explained or given ANY context - I watched the film with my husband, who hasn't read the book (and now never will) and he kept asking why certain characters did certain things or behaved in certain ways, because there's just nothing to go on! You'd never get the dynamic of any of the relationships - Ponyboy/Darrel, Johnny/Dallas - from what's shown, they just appear to be behaving erratically.

The book was very good and at the same time faithful to the book. Its a very heartwarming movie and also had a all-star cast which helped. I would rate this book a 15 out of 10.hopefully francis ford coppola will come out with the new DVD of the outsiders which has over 30 minutes of deleted scenes that is the only negative thing about the outsiders the cut out scenes when sodapop ran away,parts with the curtis brothers,ponyboys concusion, and a extended part where cherry and ponyboy are talking to each other at the park. other then that best movie hand down of the eighty's.",The Outsiders

In the movie, I thought it sent off a different type of perspective, and yet it was very well done because of the fact that it was changed a bit, though, it was basically a better image of the story where you can see through your eyes, so that you were able to picture and make out with what you originally were thinking.

Also, I have recently seen the movie, and I enjoyed it a lot. It took the most important parts, and made it into a visual effect. The killing of Bob, I imagined that exactly while reading the book. And to see that scene turn out exactly how I pictured it to be, wow! I was very impressed with the actors and actresses. They got right into their character. Matt Dillon did an awesome job of being Dally Winston. Ralph Macchio was great at being Johnny Cade. All the rest of the actors and actresses such as Diane Lane, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Esteves, Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, C. Thomas Howell and The Soc's did a wonderful job of being the character from the book. That's exactly how I pictured them to be. My advice to all of you, is read the book first, then watch the movie. The movie didn't include all 12 chapters in the book, so your best bet is to read the book to understand about how the characters act, because Ponyboy is very descriptive while giving a brief summary for each of The greaser's and soc's at the beginning of the book.

That thing on Ponyboy's chin, for intense, unless you read the book and knew that he had been cut when he was jumped, you would have thought he had nicked himself shaving or something. The end of the book was completely cut off. At the end of the book the whole sub-plot is revealed. Well, in the movie, I have yet to discover how the sub-plot is revealed. In the positive, though, it was well cast with some very good young actors. It was also fairly true to the book and S.E. Hinton plays cameo role.

This year I'm in grade 7 and we where reading the outsiders in class we had a test on the book so I just decided to watch the movie. I was so blown away about how good this movie was I love this movie so much I watch it 3 times every day when I get home from school. The characters just have so much passion I'm so sad that they didn't make a movie franchise out of it. It's too late now but they really should have. The movie also has a great story line and the actors really make you just wanna re watch the movie again and again just so you won't miss anything they should make a remake of the movie. The only way a remake would be better if they actually get the characters right and make the story according to the book. Darry is supposed to be strong handsome and mature sodapop is loyal kind a Really good looking ponyboy is smart and committed twobit is funny and like Mickey Mouse Johnny is quiet.

264,geenucoco,Great Movie summarizing the timeless troubles of adolescence,9,23 April 2014,"As I the movie came to an end, an amazing feeling swept over me. Growing up as a youth in Long Beach, California in the twenty-first century, it always seemed that the problems the youth face today were a lot worse than in the past. This movie does an astonishing job illustrating the crazy and dangerous life that teenage boys lived through in the American heartland over four decades ago! As I watched, the similarities between my adolescence and theirs gave me a very grateful feeling to have made it out of that stage of my life. For me, this movie was a very spiritual reminder of the possible dangers, temptations, loyalties, friendships, and overall craziness of teenage life. Plot The movie begins in the 1960's with three Topeka youth meeting up to sneak into a drive-in movie theater. After the movie have a fierce confrontation with the boys from the other side of town. The plot line is full of drama, confrontation with rivals, murder, running away, death, police and violence. It makes for one of the best movies you have ever seen. Acting The acting in this production is definitely up to standards. You can feel the emotions in the actors voices and see them in their eyes. It is so real it almost makes you not want to believe that they are actors. This was a very heartfelt production and I wish they would have made a sequel; before the teenage actors reached their fifties. Music The music in this film was very deep and comforting. They featured the song ""Stay Gold"" by Stevie Wonder. It keeps a deep and spiritual vibe in tune with the craziness of the youth. Characters The characters seem very interesting for mid-western youth, with some featuring names such as Sodapop and Ponyboy, and others with less interesting names such as Johnny. The characters are very believable and awe-inspiring.Ending The story has a sad, interesting, spiritual, and above all, unbelievable ending. A character, saddened by the death of a close friend, loses his sense. He is in a comic book store reading, and upon being asked to leave, simply rips up the comic book and points a gun at the cashier. He then runs through the park with police pulling up on all sides of him, before being shot to death. The ending leaves you sad, spiritual, and above all, grateful to have made it out of that stage of life. I recommend this movie to anyone who is experiencing, or has experienced a crazy childhood.",The Outsiders

I'm not really sure why I think that, but the acting was good, the directing was good, everything about it was good. The cast did a great job, especially Ralph Macchio. 1) he had to portray a 16 year old when he was 20-some odd years old and 2)Johnny had big shoes to fill up. He was one of the main characters that needed to have someone special portraying him, and Macchio did an excellent job of that. Not many people could have put the fear and frustration in their voices that Macchio did when he said ""I killed him. I killed that boy. I killed him."" The fear on his face and in his eyes was incredible, and not many people could have pulled that off. For that, kudos to Macchio!",The Outsiders
266,h-m-macko,Outsiders review and analysis of overall movie and music in film,10,30 April 2014,"This film has a very elaborate theme, but is presented in a simplistic way that has a lesson that all ages can learn from. The theme of this film is ""Stay Gold"" (The Outsiders). The meaning of this phrase is that people should remain innocent to the harsh realities of life. The phrase ""Stay Gold"" was explained in this film through Robert Frost's poem Nothing Gold can Stay (The Poetry of Robert Frost). This poem explains that when something is new it is gold or innocent, as it progresses the gold or innocence fades away. His poem concludes that no one will stay innocent. In addition to this poem, they use the sunset as a simile for staying ""Gold"". Johnny explains the comparison to Ponyboy when Ponyboy recites Robert Frost's poem and admits he does not know what it means. The sunset is a simile to staying ""Gold"" because when the sunset rises or it is new the color of it is gold just as when a person is young they are innocent. When the sunset is fading away and is turning into night it loses its gold color, like when someone grows up they lose their innocence. The theme does get complicated in the film. There are points in the film where it is suggested that there is no hope in living or trying to be innocent when one of the innocent characters die. There are also times in this film when it is not certain who contains innocence and if it can be regained. It seems that some characters in this film are reminded of their wrong doings and try to make a difference. It is also questioning when the characters realize that they cannot change the society. Even though the theme seems complicated at times, the music really portrays the main ideas in the film.The music in this film was well thought out and portrayed the theme and the plot of the movie. The music was produced by Carmine Coppola who also produced the music for the Godfather films (Carmine Coppola). The music was presented in a post-romantic style, similar to Gone with the Wind (Hickman, Roger). I believe they chose this style for the movie because Ponyboy and Johnny were reading Gone with the Wind throughout the film. Most of the music in the film was orchestrated with woodwinds and strings with chords long in duration and had a slow tempo. This gave it a very lush and romantic feel to it. They incorporated leitmotifs to portray the theme as well. Gloria by Van Morrison played whenever the people who had lost their innocence were in a scene. This song was very upbeat and the singer had a very raspy sounding voice. It was the only song in the movie that had lyrics to it in the movie. I believe that they made this the only song that had lyrics because it was played in the opening scenes and the rebels of society needed to look cooler and more modern than the rest of society. There is also a leitmotif for the innocent characters. The song is the instrumental version of Stevie Wonder's Stay Gold which was written for this film. This song is played whenever there is a sunset in the background, when Ponyboy and Johnny are discussing ""Staying Gold"", and when Ponyboy is talking to Cherry about how nothing is ever going to change between the Greasers and the Socs. Not only is this song the leitmotif, the lyrical version of the song plays in the opening credits foreshadowing what will happen in the film.The opening credits do a great job in foreshadowing what will happen in the movie. The lyrical version of the song Stay Gold has great meaning to the theme of the film. One verse ""You thought that all would last forever, but like the weather, nothing can ever and be in time, stay gold"" clearly talks about the simile of the weather and innocence and how nothing can stay gold (Stevie Wonder). Although that was the main example of how the opening credits portray the film, there are many more. The sunset is in the background while it is also flashing pictures of the different places the scenes take place at such as the railroad and an old abandoned church. The way they show the credits also symbolizes the segregation between the Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers character and the actors who played them were displayed first on the right side of the screen, and the Socs were displayed after on the left side of the screen. I personally, loved this film. The usage of music in this film was excellent and the film really captured the essence of the book. The lighting of the film made the movie look as though it was taking place in the 60's. Not only did they do well on casting the of characters, the costumes really captured the different societal standings. The main thing that I loved about this film is that it stuck to the main points of the book well. It was shot in the spot that the author had it take place at and she had a major input on what happened during the production.Overall I would highly recommend watching this film because it is a film that has a timeless theme and because most people can relate to the plot of the film.Work Cited ""Carmine Coppola"".

267,triple_threat,Wonderfully done,10,25 May 2005,"I remember about a year ago when I was informed that I would have to read The Outsiders for my English class. It sounded like the type of think I'd like: violence, revenge, and something that can be related to the way children (my peers) act these days. We recently watched this movie in the afore mentioned class, and I was astonished but the high caliber. Considering when this movie was filmed (1983) and considering the modern standards we give to almost all movies that we watch, I could not believe the way The Outsiders compared to modern movies. It's a very good movie with a very good plot. This movie/book has already proved that it's able to stand the test of time.",The Outsiders
268,LasheaLabay14,omg it is so sad,10,31 May 2005,The Outsiders was a very sad movie and book for me. i just got done watching the movie and my 8th grade class read it just before we got out for the summer. I would recommend this movie and book to everyone. It teaches people that life is not split into two different groups and that everyone is = in their own way. It also teaches that you need to stay true to yourself. Everyond and their mother needs to see this film. It will show you that there is more to life than we make of it. Plus the the actors that are in it are really cute and even though they are old now they where very good to have been so young in the movie. It was excellent. SE Hinton did a very good job of writing a book at the age of 16 and it becoming a really popular book and movie. I wish i would have discovered them earlier than i had. It was truly one of the things that I will always remember.,The Outsiders
269,heather_taylor22,the outsiders,10,2 June 2005,"my favorite movie has been ""the outsiders"" since i was 4 yrs. old. i used to watch it every single day sometimes even more than once a day. today it is still my favorite move and i have just recently read the book in my class. great book also. i have now read the book 7 times. the actors were chosen so well and put together so well w/ the characters its amazing. the movie/book reminds me of my own life. the way that i have always lived on the poor side of town no matter where i am people always mark me lousy because i don't live in decent conditions. anyways i will aways carry the memory of the outsiders with me throughout my whole life. I LOVE THE OUTSIDERS!!!",The Outsiders
270,brookesebranek,Hard to understand,3,5 October 2015,"I had to watch this movie for an English class. It was hard to follow the story-line and take notes at the same time. The movie differs a lot from the book. It was hard to watch and understand the movie considering it is 2015 and the movie was made in the 80's. They also appear to be older than the book says they are. In the book Pony is 13, but in the movie he's like in his 30's. The movie is also very short and leaves out key points from the book. The movie was much worse than the book, in my opinion. It does have a good life lesson that people can learn and use in life. I suggest age 13 plus for this movie. This movie was a good lesson, but hard to watch and understand.",The Outsiders
271,azred-19780,Good piece of writing,7,5 October 2015,"The Outsiders is a very powerful book with so many deep meanings behind it. I went through many emotions during reading this, and most of the chapters I enjoyed reading. Although it is very well written piece, it is sort of monotonous at times. As well as this, the characters, settings and plot were sometimes hard to follow. Out of 10 stars, I would give it a 7 because I did thoroughly enjoy it. It moves at a good pace, and it is very well revised. 8th graders is a good audience for this piece, and they can get many valuable lessons while reading it. The movie barely differed from the book. However, the movie is at a very very slow pacing and it was very boring to me.",The Outsiders
272,taijaheathfield,I did not like this movie,1,8 January 2016,"I found this movie was very boring. The acting was not the greatest and it did not follow the book very well. I did not enjoy the book either so the movie was just not exciting for me to watch. The characters were very well chosen and did a good job of portraying their characters. Personally I was not fond of the characters even though it was based off of a book. I found the gang fights really the only exciting part which is quite sad. When pony boy and Johnny ran away to the church, I found that part not too terrible but over all I disliked the movie a lot. I just found that it was a waste of time to sit and watch the whole movie. So many people say it is a very good movie but as someone from a younger generation I do not find it very good.",The Outsiders
273,firextear,Thought provoking,8,4 May 2016,"The Outsiders (1983) takes place in a Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1965, the town is split between the rich teens in the southern part of Tulsa that formed their own gang known as "" The Socials"" aka Soc's and the poorer teens in the north that also have their own gang called "" The Greasers"". The main characters of the film are Sodapop, Ponyboy, Dallas, Johnny, and Darry just to name a few. Well one day Dallas, the leader of The Greasers and to be honest a little psychotic, Ponyboy and Johnny go to the drive-ins and meet the rich Cherry Valance and Marcia. Ponyboy and Cherry hit it off and that doesn't sit well with Cherry's boyfriend Bob so the Socs decide to go looking for Ponyboy and Johnny. They find them at a park and when they tried to drown Ponyboy, Johnny stabbed Bob to keep him from killing his friend in the fountain. From there the boys go on the run from the cops while the two rival gangs prepare to fight it out. The Outsiders was adapted from the book with the same name written by S.E. Hinton, which was a complete hit with young adult readers, and was directed by the Francis Coppola who is best known for The Godfather series. Francis Coppola had this Apocalypse Now vibe going on during this time in his career, his adaption was a little mystical and darker than the novel. He used sudden thunderstorms, less lighting, and sunsets all of which can disappear just as quickly as they arrived which can be symbolic of the chaotic times of the characters themselves. Coppola does something really interesting, he basically eliminates the adults from the film allowing the viewers to focus that much more on the teenagers. Coppola used various editing techniques and angles, one of the more prominent uses of editing in the movie is the use of fading between scenes for a smooth transition. Also used was a type of montage when Ponyboy and Johnny were on the run so we saw quickly exactly how they got from point A to point B. Coppola also liked to layer the shots at times such as the ending when ponyboy is reading the letter from Johnny, whose face is transparent speaking the words as Ponyboy reads it. At times it seemed to me that something was off about the movie as I re-watched it for the first time in years and I pinpointed it to few things. One would be that at times the movie seemed to be dragging along and some of the characters do not have a lot of depth to them being very one dimensional, like Dallas for example being the bad boy exemplified. Another is that Coppola ended the movie in a very strange, some would say horrible way with no real sense of closure since it ends abruptly without Johnny going to trial so we the audience have no idea what happened to him. A small complaint that I have noticed from when I watched this with friends that did not read the book is that they found it very hard to keep up with the relationships of the many characters in the movie. This movie was the start of many actors careers who would go on to dominate Hollywood. C. Thomas Howell played Ponyboy and won the Young Artist Award in 1984. Matt Dillon who played Dallas went on to star in many movies and was nominated for an award for his portrayal of a racist cop in Crash(2004). Rob Lowe who played Sodapop who is Ponyboy and Darrell's brother went on to star in one of my favorite TV shows Parks and Recreation. Tom Cruise plays Rob Lowes best friend Steve who's obsessed with cars and of course we all know him from such movies as Mission Impossible(1996 ). Ralph Macchio played Johnny and also one of my all time favorite characters Daniel in Karate Kid (1984). Many other actors also rose to fame after this movie, it was completely action packed.The reviews for The Outsiders were largely not so good such as Richard Corliss from Times wrote ""Alas, The Outsiders is not quite a good one. Because it falls in with the undulating rhythm of the life of its heroes, for whom a fatal fight and a quiet night have almost equal importance, the picture never manages to reach the peaks of satisfying Hollywood melodrama."" I fully believe that this is because at the time when S.E Hinton wrote the novel she was only 15 years old and of course the content is not going to be very deep but it was a huge success because teenagers could relate to the characters.In conclusion I believe that it is very easy to be hard on the movie for what it could have been, but Coppola expertly made do with what he had plot wise keeping as close to the original content as he could. That is with the exception of the ending, but it was a very powerful movie that evoked a sense of what it was like to be a teenager that resonates with many people who watch it. Even if you do not like the movie it is undeniable that the movie gave rise to so many actors that went on the dominate Hollywood in both their young adult lives and all the way up until the present. Perhaps we would not have seen Patrick Swayze inspire us to dance in Dirty Dancing or watch as Ralph Macchio teach us Karate in Karate Kid with The Outsiders. With that being said The Outsiders although having mixed reviews was and continues to be talked about and watched even today.",The Outsiders

The book was so good I couldn't put it down. One thought that I had well Ponyboy was introducing the characters, was that I kept thinking, ""Hey. My best friends name is Sodapop, and his little brothers name is Ponyboy. And my friend Jason's nickname is Two-Bit and nobody ever calls him Jason anymore."" It was so weird to be reading the book, and my friends Sodapop and Ponyboy are almost living, breathing, replicas of the characters described in the book, it was scary! The book was so good, that when both Dally and Johnny died in the end, it made me cry. I guess because it felt like I had known all the characters in the book, and had grown up with them (just like Ponyboy says in the book) and that they were all right beside me, Ponyboy, Sodapop, Darry, Dally, Johnny, Two-Bit, and Steve, while I was reading the book and watching the movie.

I watched the movie at least 5x more than I had read the book and let me tell you, that is A LOT of times. The story and movie are tear-jerkers. With an amazing beginning, body, and ending. Francis Ford Coppola is an amazing director and he had the greatest insight of which actors would become famous one day. C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, and Patick Swayze have all turned out to be amazing actors even with Patrick Swayze and Diane Lane having a head start. It's been so many years, and even when I read the book or watch the movie now, I cry and cry just looking back at when I was in 7th grade crying over the movie and the book so many years ago.

Too often when a book ends up as a movie, the movie rips the book to shreds. However,Francis Ford Coppola did a fairly good job matching the movie to the book. However, the backgrounds of the characters were barely touched upon in the film and that took away from seeing why Ponyboy and Johnny did the things they did and took away from why they chose to reach out for help from who they did vs. who they avoided asking for help. With the addition of more background in the films beginning the feel of the movie would be more complete and the characters actions would be very self explanatory.

There are three major deaths in the story and several changed attitudes. I don't want to give anything away, but the way this book and movie have changed my life is spectacular. I went from a pretty ordinary kid (I'm 13) to someone who loves writing more than ever, looks forward to a new day and sun rises and stars, and take people's feelings to mind.

294,Angsw8-1,One of my favorite movies of all time...,9,23 February 2006,"When I first saw this movie, I loved it so much that I watched it five other times! The book was obviously amazing, but the movie just really brought out the descriptions and personality of the characters.The Outsiders is a book about a boy Ponyboy Curtis, his friends, and a rumble. Now, this book takes place in the 60's and it's the age of Greasers vs. Soc's and it wasn't pretty. The Greasers are basically the poor people and the Soc's are the rich kids with all the breaks. At the beginning of the book Ponyboy and his friend Johnnycake get in a fight with some Soc's and Johnnycake ends up killing a Soc. They have to hide out in the country until it seemed same to come back to town. They end up being able to go back to the city and there, they plan to have it out with the Soc's for good in a rumble. Greasers vs. Soc's.Many people might have not seem the newer version, so I'd advise you to see it. The first one that cam out in 1983 had a lot of scenes cut out, that i personally thought should have been in it, but since Francis Ford Copala got so many letters saying that were disappointed with the movie that he added the cut scenes. He added in a lot missing scenes that he had took out in the editing process, and released as The Outsiders: The Complete Novel. Also, here is some of the cool cast. C. Thomas Howell as Ponyboy Curtis, Matt Dilon as Dallas Winston, Ralph Machio as Johnnycake, Rob Lowe as Sodapop Curtis, Diane Lane as Cherry Valance, Emilo Esteviz as Two-Bit. (Don't mind my spelling errors!!!)In the end, well, you'll just have to go out and get the movie...",The Outsiders
295,parkerx5,"Watched the New DVD version of ""The Outsiders""",10,5 January 2006,"I just watched the updated version of this movie on DVD(""The Outsiders: The Complete Novel"" version released in 2005). I have loved the book and the movie since I was in grade school. It is so true to the book and it hasn't aged over the years. The movie makes you feel like you're right there with the characters going through what they're going through. If you love a story about family/friend relationships and coming of age tales, you'd like this movie. It is also great to see how some stars started their film careers--Ralph Macchio, Matt Dillon, Tom Cruise, Patrick Swayze, and Rob Lowe are just a few of the stars. READ THE BOOK ALSO!!!!!!",The Outsiders
296,tgrbklyn,Horrible,1,13 April 2018,"After watching 20 minutes of this, i wanted to pull all of my hair out. Many important scenes were missing, and the ""acting"" was horrible. The movie is not a worthy adaptation of the book, as it follows no proper sequence of events. Do i recommend it? That's funny.",The Outsiders
297,bradenfletcher,good i guess,1,8 January 2006,IN year 9 i read the novel with my English class and we did some drama on it. that was good and was enjoyable. then we saw the movie and not many of us didn't laugh. some of the adapted lines are corny and even some of the original plot is not great. the film misses out the important chapter one and never tells us who Tim Shepherd is. s.e. Hinton herself hardly says a word and we never see Johnny's mum like in the book. the hill is abysmal for the church and why does domino bite pony. mistakes are made in the fight scene and the end is very short. good pointsthe plot is fairly loyal during the middle. the script is pretty much the same. many of the films actors went on to be stars.the characters are as imagined,The Outsiders
298,ofi_blindman,Greatest film ever,10,29 January 2006,"Every generation should have to watch this movie, It's story that can be related to by all young adults and should be remembered for a life time. C.Thomas Howell's performance as a young greaser named Ponyboy is the best of his career. Matt Dillon is unforgettable in his hole as the slightly older but much wiser greaser. Ralph Macchio plays Jonny, a young greaser who spends most of his time scared out of his skin. This movie was a great journey as you follow the boys through their battle with there existence as social misfits. There are many great performances in this move from the likes of Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Patrick Swayze, Emilio Estevez, and Diane Lane. If you are feeling the need to watch an amazing classic this is the one to watch.",The Outsiders
299,miss_corkular,Beautifully done,10,31 May 2006,don't get me wrong i loved the movie.. but it seemed a lot of the book wasn't put into it like sandy and Sodapop..>? never talked about her in the movie!....... I love Two-Bitts Charectar ... ANd i do recommend the other movies that were based on S.E.Hinton books she truly did out do her self in rumble fish and Tex!Also Reading them they are swell written .... of course.the Robert frost poem was the most touching i think..... it really hits the spot once you read it over a few times.... and you finally get what PonyBoy and Johnny mean about staying gold!My self got this book in grade 9 to do an class discussion on ... pretty intense stuff i'd say.,The Outsiders
300,hoscalechoochoo,Very great!,10,26 April 2019,Very great movie & book I love them very dearly. The only problem with the movie is that the locomotives used in the production were introduced in the 70's and not the 60's. Very great movie though. :),The Outsiders
301,wjcoldwater,"""The book was better""?",1,18 November 2018,"It's an age old phenomenon. You read an amazing book, and you hear that they're adapting it into a movie. Obviously you're excited, and you see the film on opening night. More often than not, those who were most excited for the movie because of the book are also the most disappointed. However, this is not the case with this film. I honestly have an incredibly hard time believing that FF Copla directed this film. It is a complete artistic failure, from the writing, acting, directing, cinematography, pacing, the works. This film is not terrible because it doesn't live up to the books standard, no, this film is terrible in it's own right. A seemingly endless, boring, face-palm inducer.",The Outsiders
302,fallenfaith153,i love this book/movie,10,26 February 2006,i think the outsiders is the greatest book/movie....i don't know why but this book/movie makes me so sad that the soc' treat the greasers like that and the first time i read it i cried i mean why do the greasers have to have all the bad stuff happen to them?!?....this is the first book/movie i ever really cried to....I just think its the best book/movie ever made and i really think they should redo it so its like newer not like the fact that it happened in the 1950's just newer actors and better music and well just make it better and not add out some parts like when Randy comes to the house and when Ponyboys sick and when Pony gets a ride home from that guy and just make it more like the book....well that all i have to say right now.... <33 Julia <33,The Outsiders
303,shafia_wow76,how i liked the outsiders,10,22 March 2006,"i thought the movie was really good, the only part i didn't like was the part where johnny and dally died. That was the only bad part in the book from my point of view. Also i thought this book actually talked about real life. Like what really happens with people example racism if your white you cant hang out with brown people, thats how it was with the greasers and socs. I also liked how the greasers acted all tough around everyone and even when johnny killed Bob. Only because Bob was a really mean guy and didn't respect the greasers, so when it got to that part i was surprisingly really happy. So thats my comment about the outsiders",The Outsiders
304,clcinhouston,Awesome story about true friends,10,25 March 2006,"I love this movie, it is one of my favorite movies. It shows how true friends are and what they really mean. The shows that you can not judge a book by its cover. It is a heartfelt story about about true friends.The theme song is a very pretty song. The acting is also very good.. It has dramatic scenes. There is really no graphic stuff on here. You will love this movie.I rate this movie an overall a 10. It is one of the best movies that is out there.I am so glad they came out with the directors cut! It is fun to see the actors before they became""popular"".",The Outsiders
