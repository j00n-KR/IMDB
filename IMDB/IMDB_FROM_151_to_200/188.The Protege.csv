0,SnoopyStyle,feeling the lost of Jackson,4,4 September 2021,"Moody (Samuel L. Jackson) is a professional assassin and Anna (Maggie Q) is his protégé. They return to London after killing and stealing from a notorious gangster. She runs an antique book store and one day, the mysterious Rembrandt (Michael Keaton) walks in.This had some fun while Jackson remains on the screen. I thought he and Maggie Q work as a comedic action duo. She's the straight man. She doesn't talk much and Jackson can bounce anything off of her. The movie really loses something when it loses him. It becomes a derivative silent assassin movie when early on, it promised to be a fun irreverent blow-em-up movie. While he's gone, the movie feels like it lost something and it never really recovers it even after the reveal. This probably works better as a buddy killer comedy.",The Protege
1,boblipton,How Is There Anyone Alive In The World?,4,22 October 2021,"Maggie Q is a professional assassin. When her mentor, Samuel L. Jackson, is killed by the Rumanian Mafia, she decides to get some vengeance. Equally skilled assassin Michael Keaton meets with her to warn her off in a collegial manner.Director Martin Campbell is a specialist in films about violent people in horrible situations, like several entries in the James Bond series, and GREEN LANTERN. This one is stylishly directed, as is his wont, but I find the story itself to be annoying. It reminds me of the John Wick series, in which everyone you meet is an assassin, and the audience is left wondering why they don't all wind up killing each other.",The Protege
2,Prismark10,The Protégé,6,1 September 2021,"Martin Campbell directed the landmark BBC thriller Edge of Darkness in 1985. He was then given the task to reboot the James Bond franchise twice.Nowadays Campbell is a veteran relegated to making B movies.The Protégé has plenty of raw action, some of the violence is hard edged. The plot is forgettable and half baked.Anna (Maggie Q) was taken in by an assassin called Moody (Samuel L Jackson) who found her as a child in Vietnam.Moody has trained Anna to be a contract killer. She also uses a vintage bookshop in London as a front. One day a man called Rembrandt (Michael Keaton) walks into her shop and Anna's world changes.Soon people she knows have been killed and Anna goes after the baddies for revenge. The finale ends up in Vietnam where Anna's traumatic past is revealed.Along the way Ann has several showdowns with the enigmatic Rembrandt who is a fixer for a shady billionaire philanthropist who once faked his own death.The Protégé is a slickly action thriller let down by a poor plot which holds little surprises.Maggie Q is fine. Samuel L Jackson can do this in his sleep.Keaton makes the most of the action scenes which is remarkable given his age. Although he gives the movie some class, you get the feeling he is slumming it after a career boost from movies such as Birdman and Spotlight.",The Protege

4,kosmasp,Revenge Maggie Q style,8,11 November 2021,"When you sometimes read famous actors appear in a movie you may not have heard anything about, mostly the actors are in the movie for a couple of seconds. In this case, especially Michael Keaton really is in this a lot more than I expected. And he is sooooo good in it. It's the Keaton charme you may say - and you would not be wrong.The movie concentrates on Maggie Q and her mission(s). You may already know what she is after if you watched the trailer, but there are still a few surprises along the way. Also the action is quite well choreographed. Yes Maggie Q, Michael Keaton and others probably only did a small percentage of their stunts - but that is what the stunt people are there for.And let's not forget: the movie was made by Martin Campbell. Which is the reason this was shown in theatres in America - unfortunately not in Germany though. I can imagine the impact this has on a bigger screen too, but it is not the same. Well made, even if it has the odd cliche once in a while. The actors and the action make up for that ... also the story does take you to wild places ... for better or worse of course, but I'd argue mostly for better.",The Protege
5,paul_haakonsen,Good action crime thriller...,6,8 October 2021,"Initially I was thrilled about getting to sit down to watch ""The Protége"" from writer Richard Wenk and director Martin Campbell, but someone had mentioned that the movie wasn't really all that great. So it was with a bit of doubt that I sat down to watch ""The Protége"". Regardless of how it was playing out, then I would watch it, as the movie had a rather nice cast ensemble.And I must say that I am glad that I opted to watch the movie, because I happened to enjoy the movie. This was a good old fashioned action crime thriller, for better or worse. Sure, the storyline and plot may have been predictable and somewhat generic, but who cares? It made for good wholesome entertainment.The storyline is easily followed and doesn't really require all that much in the intellectual department, so you just switch off the old gray and lean back and enjoy the movie. And yeah, that was actually a good thing about the movie, because it is a munch-on-the-popcorn-and-enjoy-the-action kind of movie.""The Protége"" has a good cast ensemble. And truth be told, of course I had to watch ""The Protége"" given the fact that Maggie Q was starring in it, as she tends to make some pretty decent action movies. And she was nicely cast for ""The Protége"", I will say that much. And it certainly was nice to have the likes of Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson in a movie such as this as well.There is a good amount of action and fight scenes throughout the course of ""The Protége"", which definitely help bring the movie up and into a good pacing.I was adequately entertained by ""The Protége"", and it is a movie well-worth watching if you like action crime thrillers.My rating of ""The Protége"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",The Protege
6,siderite,The only good thing was Michael Keaton,5,11 September 2021,"If you want a movie about a kickass female assassin, try Kate (2021), which I watched just before this. It may have influenced my rating, since this is not particularly a bad movie, but it is certainly not a good one.In this film, Maggie Q is a child taken as a protégé of a famous assassin, played by Samuel L. Jackson. He gets killed so she starts a crusade to find the person who ordered the hit. The beginning is formulaic and mediocre, but it's the best part of the film. The middle is a chaotic mess, filled with hard to believe scenes, and the ending is a big WTF. I mean, she has Jackson as a father figure, a man celebrating 70, but then she has an affair with Keaton, who is of the same age and the person in charge of killing her and protecting her target. And that ""twist"". Ugh!To be frank, I only watched this because of the cast: some Romanians that I was curious to see acting in a Hollywood film and the holly trinity of Jackson, Keaton and Patrick. However they are all old and came here for the money only. And the Romanian actors had a few lines before they died. Classic.Bottom line: Michael Keaton was great with what they gave him, but other than that the film was pretty dumb.",The Protege
7,thesar-2,Pretty Protégé,8,2 September 2021,"This was one of those rare movies I saw the poster and knew because of: Maggie Q, Michael Keaton, Martin Campbell and Sam Jackson, I had to see this. And I was correct.Total throwback to the 90s/early 2000s action/revenge thrillers with a badass, beautiful assassin only, they really made her vulnerable this time. Which I liked, but I was more pleased when she knew all the angles, escape paths and if she'd make it out dead or alive.Moody rescues little Anna from Vietnam after a horrible incident and gives her a new life....as a highly trained assassin like himself. When he's found dead after researching an old missing person, Anna will stop at nothing to find out why and eliminate the people in the path she takes.Movie's not without its flaws - I didn't like the big reveal in the end of the 2nd act and Batman, er, Michael Keaton is supposedly the most brilliant bodyguard, but leaves the door unlocked. (I understood why, but he can't be #1 and #10 best at the same time.)Still, I love Maggie Q for many years and she was SO MUCH fun to watch here, even when she's down. Plus, Keaton, so awesome he still looks and acts as great as his Jackie Brown days. And I especially loved the ending. Highly recommended for old spy/slow-burn action lovers.***Final Thoughts: And still...I wish she was superhuman. Boy, do I love superhuman good OR bad guys. Especially women ones.",The Protege
8,UniqueParticle,Yo this movie is super awesome!,9,22 August 2021,"I absolutely love Maggie Q in The Protégés and Live Free or Die Hard, I need to see her in more! This has some of the most thrilling action I've ever seen, some clever dialogue, very good story and excellent acting. It's so wonderful to see Micheal Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson still do stylish action like they were in the 90's in my opinion some of the best movies came out then. I wouldn't trust the ones that didn't like a lot about The Protégée cause it's got everything you'd want in the genre while being well filmed! I don't know why this already has down votes but that not nice!",The Protege
9,cruise01,Just another assassin like action film that puts Maggie Q in action.,6,24 August 2021,"3 out of 5 stars.The Protege is a fair action thriller film that has some entertaining action. Boring plot. And decent cast performances. Its one of those assassin like films where the story is about an assassin going after a group of bad guys. Who killed one of her own friends for tying up loose ends. Sure there is a little more to the story.The plot is about Anna (Maggie Q) an assassin who works for Moody (Samuel L. Jackson). Who is like a farher figure to her when he took her in when her family was killed and she went on a vengeance spree as a child. When Rembrandt (Michael Keaton) and his man go after a person she is friends with. She decides to go after them all.The plot is like any other assassin flick. Sets up the action and for the character to go beat down through so many guys and crazy shoot outs. Once credits start rolling. The film is forgettable.It does have a lot of entertaining action sequences and shoot outs. Maggie Q stealing the show. She is great in Nikita series. And the film is kind of like a movie version of it. Michael Keaton was decent as the character. Along with Samuel L. Jackson.Sadly, Martin Campbells direction has been a slight disappointment. His early films like Legend or Mask of Zorro. Vertical Limit. Goldeneye and Casino Royale were his better films. And his recent work has been a slight let down.",The Protege

Chick ""gangsters"" are simply not credible looking, because they are weaker than men and they simply dont exist in real life. So why make (YET ANOTHER) one of these movies?Not any good? It starts out action packed. But when Samuel L Jackson disappears from the story (within the first half hour) the movie tanks. Michael Keaton is a good actor, but he simply looks too old now to perform a cool and ruthless gangster.Not completely terrible, but simply below par.",The Protege
12,stevendbeard,Action Packed Thrill Ride,8,20 August 2021,"I saw ""The Protege"", starring Maggie Q-Fantasy Island_2020, Balls of Fury; Michael Keaton-Spider_Man:Homecoming, the Batman movies; Robert Patrick-Scorpion_tv, True Blood_tv and Samuel L. Jackson-you can just about name a movie and he was in it.This is an action packed thrill ride with a stellar cast. Samuel plays a contract killer, aka assassin, that finds Maggie-as a child-on one of his hits and decides to take her under his wing and train her in the art of being an assassin. It might have had something to do with the way he found her, too, and what she did, as a child. Anyway, 30 years later, someone puts a hit on Samuel so Maggie goes out for revenge. Michael plays the head of security for the bad guys and he and Maggie have several great scenes together. Robert plays the leader of a biker gang that is friends with Maggie-and Samuel-and wants to help Maggie on her vengeance trip.It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence, language and sexual content-brief nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.I really loved this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",The Protege

16,kluseba,Finally a dynamic action thriller with a strong female lead character that convinces from start to finish,9,17 September 2021,"The Protégé is a very entertaining action thriller with stunning action scenes, excellent actresses and actors and memorable locations. This kind of movie should appeal to all those who have admired the John Wick franchise as well as the recent Nobody or films such as Atomic Blonde, Peppermint and Red Sparrow.The movie revolves around Anna Dutton, a Vietnamese orphan who has grown up in the United Kingdom and owns a bookstore selling rarities in her professional life. In her secret life however, she is a high-profile assassin that takes out criminals to make the world a better place. Her personal life comes into play when the man who saved and raised her gets assassinated. Anna Dutton has to travel to Vietnam to revisit her gruesome past and find out who instigated the hit against her father figure.This film convinces on multiple levels. It has breathtaking pace through almost two hours that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The action scenes involve intense shootings, quick knife fights and a selection of dynamic martial arts elements.The acting performances are also particularly inspiring. Maggie Q plays one of the greatest roles in her career and fully convinces as intellectual, passionate and resilient heroine who is both believable as bookshop keeper and professional assassin which is quite challenging to achieve. Her father figure is incarnated by charismatic Samuel L. Jackson who plays a character with wit and grit but also a heart of gold. Michael Keaton plays a rival assassin who plays a fascinating game of cat and mouse with the protagonist. He is unpredictable as he is analytical, brutal and cold at one moment just to impress with charm, elocution and intellect in the next scene.The locations are memorable because they walk off the beaten path. The opening sequences take place in the beautiful countryside of Romania, the movie then shifts to some elegant buildings in the United Kingdom before being transferred to the different facets of Vietnam from isolated highways over downtown buildings of steel and glass to a top-security mansion.While the story might be somewhat predictable, this movie stands out in a genre that has recently been oversaturated thanks to its excellent execution from start to finish.If you like dynamic action thrillers with strong female lead characters, you are certainly going to appreciate The Protégé for its stunning action scenes, excellent actresses and actors and memorable locations. Enjoy the movie on the big screen and you will realize that it's much better than its lukewarm reputation.",The Protege
17,masonfisk,TOO LITTLE TOO LATE...!,3,6 September 2021,"Maggie Q does the La Femme Nikita thing in this current release directed by Martin Campbell (Edge of Darkness/Casino Royale). Samuel L. Jackson is a shadowy operative working Vietnam during the end of the war when he walks in on a bloodbath perpetrated by a young abused girl so what does he do, he takes her under his wing to train & as we flash forward 30 years, she has the rep of being the best of the best working from a Blighty bookstore (which Jackson has paid off as a means of gratitude) when a past case falls into their lap which becomes more embroiled as anyone who even asks about the person gets killed for their efforts (Jackson gets iced early) which send Maggie Q to Vietnam to track down the mysterious mark killing & evading anyone who comes after her even when the mark's chief enforcer, played Michael Keaton, give her a run for her money & one point beds her (?). Coming from the usually extremely reliable Campbell who can still direct action sequences w/the best of them in his late 70's but this story, credited to The Equalizer scribe, Richard Wenk, feels like some early screenplay he wrote, put on a shelf & due to the pandemic, the studio said let's make this. They shouldn't've since it feels like a throwback to an age of forgettable late night cabler programming that if you look at the kind of action films being made today (your John Wicks, the Raid films), the screenplay would've needed to undergo a drastic overhaul but since there are more than enough explosions & head shots in attendance, the foreign market will be satisfied. Also starring Robert Patrick, the leader of a biker gang in Vietnam (?) & Patrick Malahide (who was in The World is Not Enough) as a crooked lawyer.",The Protege

Maggie Q can kick butt and act!",The Protege
19,AudioFileZ,Action Well Done,7,1 September 2021,"The Protege is that special kind of slick action film that feels gritty and real. In simple terms it pulls you in to the characters immediately and never lets up. It may go to the edge of the top but keeps it real and gritty enough to never insult. The story may not be what one would call original, but it works well thanks to excellent direction and casting. Speaking of casting I give it high marks all around. Especially Maggie Q who is perfect as an assassin with a moral code. She makes the character of Anna smart, sympathetic and...deadly. To get to her mission of justice she has to go through several layers of bad guys one of which is played by Michael Keaton. Keaton is in excellent form here too often stealing the scenes he's featured in. Keaton gives his character, Rembrant, layers that make you actually like him as you are hoping Anna outwits him. I always enjoy seeing Robert Patrick too and he is solid as usual in his small supporting role.This movie moves so well it passes downright fast. The ending was somewhat unexpected adding to what is an entertaining ride.",The Protege
20,rgkarim,"A Protege inherits great acting and class, but for action/thriller it needs ore of a pass.",7,21 August 2021,"LIKES:Fun at times:
Action movies are meant to be exciting and fun depending on the world that is built around the nature of the action. Protégé is a movie with a lot of complexity to it, and amidst it all is a fun ride that at times nails that entertaining level. The movie has a spy vs. Spy attitude for me, a fun rivalry of the two main leads dancing around each other in an entertaining display to watch. It's those ""lighter"" moments that sort of relieve the darker tones of the movie, and also the funnier elements that my audience and I laughed at during the ordeal.Comedy:
It's dry, but it's clever. Protégé is not so much about cramming jokes into every facet of the film, but instead focuses on hitting just those right moments to bring an actor's skill in to bring a laugh. Samuel L Jackson's brash, crude, aggressive nature is exploited well at moments to set the stage for the sakes. Maggie Q's no nonsense, calm delivery, acts as a challenge to the big bad bullies and the boldness is humorous. Michael Keaton's charm and blunt statements, feels much like his Batman days and it all works super well. True it's not the most laugh inducing moments, but the timing of the humor alongside fitting in with this very professional world was a welcome addition for me.The Character Dynamics/Development:
An action movie sometimes forego character development for stunts, or requires multiple movies to cover the key facets of their lives, or to continue making more of their lives (see Fast and Furious). However, the Protégé's storytelling is very representative of an actor who knows what he is doing, and keeps the storytelling on track without taking too many detours from the theme of the movie. Anna's life has a lot of complexity to it, and throughout the movie we take dives into the components that make her tick/drive her passion. While still the assassin, the movie does a great job showing much more beneath the cold shell, and seeing those moments intertwined to fuel the actions was great to evolve a normally monochromatic role. Even the other characters had their facades chipped away through the movie, getting a taste of the mind games they play and their own passion in this crazy game of accomplishing the mission. These characters are indeed the selling point of the story, and I found myself more enthralled in their stories than the actual mission itself.Mission with a twist:
The movie succeeds in also adding some turns into a normally linear mission, and requires one to pay attention to the dialogue of the film. It holds a lot of hints if you can piece things together, guiding you to the true heart of evil that caused these events to unfold the way they did. All the relationships, the random pieces of information, or even the random asides eventually all link up to the complete story and you can figure out the face of the ""Boss"". It's that level of detail and helping wrap the story/relationships together into the mission to give it a little more mirth, like what we got with Skyfall.Some of the Action:
The action does fit in again with the theme of the movie. It holds the lethal edge of an assassin film, showing skill, accuracy, and cold hearted deprivation that the job requires. Some of the fights have a little more vigor to it, the expected shoot out with lots of effects to whip up the adrenaline and I liked these moments most. When these moments hit, they helped speed up the pace of the film, while also giving me the excitement of the action film genre I fully appreciate.A Strong Lead
All in all, I have to say that the writing of this movie did a great job making a strong female lead compared to other films in the modern era. Maggie Q's work in portraying the role matches the professionalism of the character in both ruthless efficiency and professional air of classiness. However, the writing and direction gave me a female lead that wasn't perfect and in my face. Anna is a flawed being, whose trauma has required her to dive into darker areas to survive, but not lose herself into some perfect, untouchable force. She takes injuries, she has vulnerabilities, and it costs her mistakes that she has to face both external and internal. Having that character be a center point with all of these other relation dynamics makes for a believable character and one to root for without feeling like some political agenda is the main reason for her existence. So well done on accomplishing these goals.DISLIKESPredictable:
Maybe just to viewer like me, a lot of the twists did little to surprise me with the revelations they did. Between the subtle details not showing certain things to the foreshadowing in the dialogue, it's not the most surprising or mind blowing twist I've seen. There are other aesthetics to help blunt this dislike, but nevertheless, no major surprises for me in this installment.The Action is Kind Of Boring:
Thought fitting into the theme and classiness of the movie, it's really not the most exciting action flick I have seen. An exciting opening that shows promises peters out to a lot of walking, hiding, and ducking rather than the James Bond antics I personally enjoy in other movies. Again, an elite agent trained to take on the darkest characters, I had hoped for a little more challenge and bang, especially at the end when the ultimate stronghold felt a little too easy to get into and away from. The trailers paint a lot more excitement than in this ""elevated"" action piece and I don't think it's quite the gun toting adventure you might expect it to be.The character usage:
Three characters are used quite well, but several of the other characters that they introduce are kind of bland and pointless in their inclusion. Sure it sets up the story and how deep this mission is going, but at the same time these characters have little time or importance to the story, feeling more like a plot device than anything else.. My biggest pet peeve involves giving me potential and then dropping it for character usage and this movie does a lot of this in my opinion.The Pacing:
Elegant as it is, the pace of the movie is a bit slow, primarily in about the 25-40 minutes interval of putting pieces together with little excitement breaking the dialogue up. Protégé's focus on dialogue and clever Spy vs. Spy dancing makes for a slower movie that sometimes gets lost in the classy approach it tried to take. I appreciate a lot of the stet up and more realistic nature that comes with the spy/assassin job, but again a little theatrics can help break open adrenaline to assist.The Ending:
I won't reveal anything, but the ending almost felt like an afterthought for me at least in terms of the point. The last ten to fifteen minutes reveals the final insights into the girl's history (at least those that are relevant) and ties up the dynamic that has been building for the whole movie. While I appreciate the wrap up, the execution just feels kind of bland, rushed, and unfulfilling, with enough vagueness to launch another film if they needed. All the dialogue, the buildup, and again potential are dropped into sort of that artistic finish that is not for me. I don't hate it, but I can say I was hoping for a stronger finish.The VERDICT:The Protégé feels like a B movie plot, but elevated to A level qualities on so many levels. It's a smarter action film, that focuses on the wit and the character over the spectacle giving great ringers to root for in the shorter run time. With humor well timed, a theme defined that they stick with, some okay action moments and this nice dance, this movie gets props for the alternative it took. And my favorite quality hands down is the strong female lead that did not feel too much like a political piece compared to other strong female leads. However, the artistic quality also robs the piece of exactly what you might be looking for, the spectacle and action piece that thrillers are expected. Protégé's pacing is a bit off and the character usage is poor for me outside of the three main billed actors, despite the build up we were promised. With some action that is a bit dry like the humor and an ending that did not quite pull that sizzle together, I can say this movie is okay for the long run, but better watched at home.My scores are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0.",The Protege
21,arungeorge13,Didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would! [+44%],4,31 August 2021,"The Protégé is extremely weak in the writing department that it has to make do with its three charismatic lead performers and a few not-bad set pieces. Director Martin Campbell's films have always been a mixed bag - he made Casino Royale (which in my books, is one of the best Bond flicks, period!), the thrill-by-the-minute Vertical Limit (which was a neat throwaway action flick), and also stinkers such as Green Lantern and Beyond Borders. I'd position The Protégé among his weaker films though not an absolute write-off. It even starts off well before diving into the familiar action territories of Lyon: The Professional and John Wick.Michael Keaton's character is supposed to be the film's trump card. However, the writing (by Richard Wenk) is so drab that it only adds to the overall tedium of the screenplay. Samuel L Jackson's script choices have lately not been the greatest (Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, Spiral, and now this) and it looks like he's in it to have guns blazing fun at 72. While I was excited to see Maggie Q finally get her due in Hollywood playing the lead in a studio-backed actioner, I realized later it should have been in a better film altogether. She's convincing as an arse-kicker and also looks insanely hot while at it - David Leitch, Chad Stahelski, and others - take note.I found the pairing of Michael Keaton and Maggie Q to be rather odd. This isn't the '80s or '90s. We don't need to witness weird sexual chemistry between a 69-year-old and a 42-year-old during an indoor set piece. The transition of tone is also very abrupt. One moment, a side character is cracking a joke and the next minute, he's murdered in the most gruesome way. And this doesn't happen just once. It's the way the film is structured as a whole - just throwing a whole bunch of moments at you. As scenes, they just don't mesh well. Even 77-year-old Campbell can do better - he already has proven himself. Let's give Maggie the action movie she deserves before it's too late!",The Protege
22,NijazBaBs,typical foreign action,5,10 September 2021,"This look like typical asian or non english action. Meaning evasion of death, unrealistic extreme setup of action, and many twists. It all looks too quick, negative, desperate, filleed with negativity. I expected more realism and emotions, positive ones. Instead there are filthy things like promiscuity, dirty relationships, and kingpins and lots of violence and blood. Main actor is also not that beautiful. Maybe was that small girl main actor (the one who shows her as being young) this would be much better. Lots of holes and unfinished stuff. Lots of setups.",The Protege

24,abisio,A tale of redemption and friendship in an unusual thriller,9,20 August 2021,"A hired killer (Samuel Jackson) meets, 30 years ago, in Vietnam a girl with excellent shooting skills; and adopt her.Thirty years later; both are in the same profession; but Jackson character is dying of cancer and wants to clean up his conscience somehow; so ask his adult protégé (Maggie Q) to look for somebody he kill 30 years ago in Vietnam. Things get ugly, lots of violent killings and revenge begins.If you believe is one of those movies with a girl killing everybody in pure revenge mode; well is not exactly so.First of all Anna must find out what happened; second she is very skilled but not a super human; so she gets hurt a lot with severe pain.Third another character some kind of love interest / botty call appears (Michael Keaton) doing the bad but charismatic character he can do while sleeping.The twists are somehow predictable but make the story interesting. Adding sporadic flashes of humor and strong violence keep the interest level high.At then; the movie gets a more serious tone which makes a lot of sense but might not be the best closing for normal viewers.Acting is very good in general; Maggie Q and Samuel Jackson have chemistry to spare; and Keaton does not stay behind.In brief; never boring, quite entertaining and well acted and directed. Is not a mega budget picture but good enough for many tastesViolence is sometimes extreme but not explorative. The f.",The Protege

27,kuarinofu,Even an action film should have a comprehensible story,5,1 September 2021,"'The Protégé' was a perfectly fine simple action film up to an hour into it.After that, the characters were just set loose. I was unable to understand why was anyone doing what they were doing. Every character's motivation was beyond me. What was the point of Jackson's fakeout? Why did Maggie Q and Keaton have a Mr. & Mrs. Smith dynamic but not really? Why does Jackson give moral speeches to people before the assassinations, this seems just a little hypocritical? Why did Maggie Q want a normal life in peace when she clearly had one and she never showed any signs of discontent with her murdering lots of people for money (it was more like she enjoyed it)? Barely anything makes sense in this film.In the end, it seemed like Moody was the main villain and not some generic corrupt businessman. I mean, he never cared for the hacker kid who got steamed because of him, or his maid, he was perfectly fine with dead bodies piling up.The thing is if you want to write in a twist - do so. Something stupid happening can't be a twist by itself. You can trick a viewer by showing him/her what you want, but not the characters of your film, it just doesn't work like that. The viewer assumes that if something affected a character's motivation - this actually happened.Overall, 'The Protégé' feels like a moderately budgeted action film with a couple of big names filmed in cheaper and convenient countries with no-name extras.

Regardless of 'The Protege' setting out to incite a theatrical yet vicious path of R-rated Action Thriller; it ended up becoming nothing but an inconsequential failure and another addendum to the incessant list of Could Haves & Should Haves.It's a badly outlined portrayal that is littered with countless inconsistencies, has superficial characters with fictitious depths, and on top of everything else; there is a serious lack of emotional profoundness. I can go on and on about its ceaseless deficiencies, but I won't be doing that; cause there's no need to.

30,trinaboice,Flawed but still fun,7,27 August 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Samuel L. Jackson in Vietnam? Sure! I'm sold! Don't we all love seeing him be a fish out of water in crazy situations? Add the lovely Maggie Q and hilarious Michael Keaton and you've got yourself a great start. The story is about Anna, who is the world's most skilled contract killer. She was rescued as a child by the legendary assassin Moody. However, when Moody is brutally killed, she vows revenge for the man who taught her everything she knows. As she becomes entangled with an enigmatic killer (Michael Keaton) whose attraction to her goes way beyond cat and mouse, their confrontation turns deadly and the loose ends of a life spent killing will weave themselves ever tighter. This entertaining action thriller is brought to us from the studio that created John Wick and the director of Casino Royale, Martin Campbell.THINGS I LIKED:
Fans of Nikita will be thrilled to see the beautiful Maggie Q back in action. She has beauty, brains, and brawn in every movie and TV show she does.Michael Keaton still has some moves at 69 years old. His cat and mouse action scene with Maggie Q was impressive and hilarious.The main leads look like they had a lot of fun making the film. They all got game.We get to travel all over the world to places like Vietnam, London, and Bucharest.There is some dark humor, entertaining sarcasm, and delicious banter that showcases playful relationships between some of the leading characters.Surely, a sequel or even a prequel is to follow.Don't get comfortable...there's a twist!There are a lot of scenes with no dialogue, just action or setup.Great tension building with camerawork and music...and mostly sexual tension.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It takes about 29 minutes to establish the characters and their relationships and then the action begins.Some of the sound-mixing wasn't very good and some of the edits were odd.Some subplots are completely dropped.Somewhat predictable revenge story.The plot is a bit stuffed and messy.It's annoying and ridiculous when a bunch of skilled shooters fire away non-stop for 30 seconds and miss their mark.For being ""the world's most skilled contract killer, Anna sure gets caught and shot a lot.Quite a few exposition scenes, especially during the last 10 minutes.We've definitely seen this kind of movie before.Some entertaining moments but forgettable after a couple of days.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of bloody violence with guns and other weapons, as well as hand-to-hand combat
Explosions and destruction
Several languages are spoken, often without subtitles
Profanity, including F-bombs
Premarital relations
You have to read newspaper clippings
Torture scenes like waterboarding

31,destroyerwod,Solid action flick in its genre,7,8 October 2021,"Normally in October i watch mostly horror/halloween movies but lately i been going to bed early and those movies don't really match well with sunlight. This movie came out recently and i usually enjoy those type of assassin's ""John Wickest movies"" so i said lets hold on Halloween movies a bit and lets watch this. After Gunpowder Milkshake, Kate, Polar, Nobody and many others here comes Maggy Q as the badass assassin with a grudge (and a reputation).Overall the movie is well made, its efficient at what it does, enjoyable, Maggy Q is as good as she usually is, and Samuel L Jackson... i mean... its Sam Jackson, he can be in anything and always be great in it. Movie also co-star Michael Keaton wich was surprising to see in a role like this, and he was also super good in it.Otherwise its a classic textbook of the genre, it won't revolutionize anything, but its well made all around and is clearly a good time.

Jackson). Anna is so trained to be a hit man. When Moody is murdered, Anna vows to take revenge and find the culprit.Martin Campbell managed to break through in the film world with his Zorro and James Bond films, but after Casino Royale from 2006 he has not directed a special film for a long time. With this film he tries again to make a comeback with a spy thriller, only he has to make do with a well-known film script.

For some even so familiar that the film can come across as very predictable at a time.The action and espionage scenes are entertaining, but otherwise not very special. The most exciting scenes are when Maggie Q has Conversations with her enemy played by Michael Keaton.

43,darkreignn,"A serviceable, but forgettable, action thriller",6,20 August 2021,"Martin Campbell is a director who I respect very much; helming two of the best 007 movies ever in ""GoldenEye"" and ""Casino Royale,"" and more recently reuniting with Pierce Brosnan and bringing Jackie Chan back in action with ""The Foreigner,"" Campbell has proven himself as a competent director of high quality action dramas. Both James Bond movies mentioned above have not only fantastically crafted action scenes but genuinely intriguing plots and well-written characters, and ""The Foreigner"" is no different. So, when I saw the below average trailer for ""The Protégé"" I was, at first, underwhelmed and unexcited - that is, until I saw the words ""Directed by Martin Campbell.""Once again, Martin Campbell proves that he can direct incredible action sequences that are always full of style and sometimes bursting with brutality; one specific fight ended with a particularly violent death involving a hammer and a receipt spike, and it's scenes like that that remind me how good of an action filmmaker Campbell is. Maggie Q is a surprisingly good action heroine, holding her own in ways that are actually believable. Utilizing her environment to dispose of her opponents seems second nature to her, as does planning their demise before she even steps foot in the same same room as them; she's a very clever protagonist, which made it easy to want to see her succeed. However, the major showstealer and most badass character in this movie was easily Michael Keaton - not only does he take part in some of the best action scenes in the movie, but his character is just so slick and suave that you won't be able to help but root for him. He shares some amazing scenes with Maggie Q, and while their dialogue was, at times, pretty cringy, Michael always delivered his lines with the aurora of a snake oil salesman - that is, sly, devilish, and charming - which made even the worst written scenes a lot of fun to watch.So yes, ""The Protégé"" has a few good action scenes in it. Yes, only a few. Unfortunately, while the action is well crafted and well shot, there isn't nearly enough of it. This film goes through very long stretches of drought where you'll be begging for an action scene to happen instead of watching characters talk from scene to scene to scene. This could've been forgiven if one of two things were at play to remedy this: 1) If the action we did get was memorable, but to be honest, it's just not. Sure, the action isn't bad by any means, but the scenes are so short and so few and far between that by the time the next set piece comes along you'll have already forgotten what happened in the last one. 2) If the dialogue was especially well-written (as we've covered above, it's not) or if the plot was especially unique. And unfortunately, it isn't.""The Protégé"" has an, at first, pretty straightforward plot - someone who Anna (Maggie Q) knows has been killed, and she wants revenge. Sounds simple enough, right? I thought so too. That is, until the movie starts dropping character names, past events, and seemingly unrelated plot elements with the speed and ferocity of parents passing out candy on Halloween night. I'm by no means dumb (that's what I tell myself at least), but there was so much stuff and people being talked about in this film at all times that at some point I just gave up on trying to figure out who people were, what they were doing, and why they were doing it, and started watching this movie strictly for the action scenes. Truth be told, this is a pretty bare bones movie, with a bare bones story, so why all the needless convolution? Instead of making the best with what they had, it seems like the scriptwriters wanted to turn a simple revenge story into something smarter than it needed to be. And perhaps it could've worked, but it only succeeded in dumbing everything down.This is by no means a bad film, but it is a forgettable one. It has a certain slickness and style to it that can be infectious to allow yourself to get pulled into. As I said, the action is legitimately good, and Michael Keaton alone is worth the price of admission. That said, don't expect anything other than a serviceable diversion. As Jeremy Jahns says, you'll forget this one in t-minus two hours.",The Protege

With that I shall paste the following from one of the reviewers I am talking about...
quote, ""Chick ""gangsters"" are simply not credible looking, because they are weaker than men and they simply dont exist in real life."" unquote. Now that is a critique from someone who has no knowledge or idea of what he has just said. Instead of being a pompous fool they could have spent a little time researching the facts (and I'm assuming because of what was said) instead of being a typical knee jerk chauvanistic idiot!Some of the most dangerous, and lethal assassins, in human history have been women (some of those successful ladies have been so because they used their targets dumb, chauvanistic mentality against them; by pretending to be weak damsels in distress types etc). The most successful among them was a Russian lady by the name of Lyudmila Mikhailovna Pavlichenko who was a sniper during WWII (World War 2) and had a credited kill count of 309 kills. I myself believe it was higher as there was not always someone there to accredit her kills!This film goes back to the earlier action genre times of cinema where the premise was to just entertain the theater goers. Mind you back then they didn't make the amount of goofs and gaffs that film makers do today; this film was loaded with mistakes and sloppyness but we had a good starring cast to help distract yo from the tardiness :) - though Michael Keatons role was a bit daft considering his age; but I suppose if Sylvestor can get away with it then allowances need to be made here! Maggie Q is (and has been for many, many years) a woman of many acting capabilities. This to me was her taking on her old role of NIKITA whom she played in the TV series from 2010-2013 - and she absolutely nailed that spot on; their have been other well known actresses who played the part but Maggie just stood out head and shoulders above allcomers...she has played assassin roles in quite a few films in the West and the East! Some guy who reviewed this slagged this film because he did not not think Maggie was good looking/sexy enough...what a trivialistic childish minded numb-nut little man!She and Samuel Jackson played off of each other superbly but the film flow was spoilt massively by having him taken out early in the film. It would have made a great action comedy with their back and forth banter with each other. It would also have detracted peoples minds away from the boring and ill explained background of why people were trying to kill them! The Michael Keaton fight sequence choreography part was a bit drab but it flowed well, like a Wing Chun Kata practice session, due to Maggies perfect style. The rest of the films choreography was very impressive, with some very new and fresh ideas in the general combat sequences. Things that spoilt the action scenes were, guns that never got reloaded (something that is infuriatingly prevalent in more and more films these days....very sloppy indeed) and, the amount of times that Maggie was shot and where she was shot; because both would have put her out of action immediately!Apart from all that its a film you can just sit back and enjoy and forget about having to nitpick like a critic.

She is believable and way more nuanced than, say, Die Hard, where she was robotic. Here she slides into a rapport with every character. As does, somehow, Keaton. The pair have an undeniably great chemistry that outstrips Jackson, and he is far from bad in this.The choreography is great. Whoever did Keatons stunt doubling was incredible. It's seamless. The script is better than you'd expect but not incredible. It fails to get across a theme, and knows this. You'll find it instead plays directly into thriller formula, sticking to what it does best. There aren't any cringe one-liners but there is just enough plot to get from set piece to set piece and enough motivation to propel the characters there. That said, there's numerous fun subversions, which makes it overall really great time.The trailer does a good job of setting expectations and the film clears it easily. It's fun as hell-far exceeding comparisons like Neeson's action forays, Infinite of this year, and the hyper generic ""Has Fallen"" trilogy, somehow rated higher than this.

65,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,The Protégé Misfires as a Summer Blockbuster,4,28 August 2021,"It seems like there's a couple new movies every weekend on both streaming platforms and in the theaters. Are we still going to theaters? Last weekend, new releases included an action, thriller assassin movie, The Protégé, which was only in theaters. What happens when you kill a well-trained assassin's mentor and then come after her? Well, this movie attempts to show us just that. Here's how it goes.Martin Campbell, who has directed some films in the James Bond franchise, brings his action/thriller sensibilities to the story of an elite contract killer, Anna (Maggie Q). In The Protégé, Anna seeks to avenge the brutal murder of her mentor and father figure, Moody (Samuel L. Jackson), who is himself an legendary assassin. As Anna investigates the murder and attempts to avoid the same fate as her mentor, she get involved in a game of cat-and-mouse with yet another contract killer (Michael Keaton). Hijinks ensue.Are you interested in this or do you already know where it's going? It's okay if you do because honestly you do. I actually became pretty bored with this about half way through, which is unfortunate for a movie that's less than 2 hours long. The problem is that the plot goes everywhere you expect it to go. There are also some random twists that are definitely groan-worthy. Therefore, the movie has to rely on the action and the thrilling set pieces to keep your attention - some are good and some are meh.Luckily, Maggie Q is front and center of The Protégé. Maggie Q commands every frame that she is in. She is a very capable fighter and believable as an contract killer. She has such a likeable presence that it is understandable that you'd stick around throughout this otherwise blah movie. I hope Maggie Q gets the chance to do something better. Samuel L. Jackson does a decent in job in a thankless role. He's Sam Jackson, so there can't be much to complain about as he's a good partner for Maggie Q. I do have problems with Michael Keaton. His casting is both interesting and all wrong for the part and movie. I don't get his character, which is very detrimental to the film overall. Keaton is good for what he's does, but it's random and completely took me out of the movie. It's days later and I'm still rolling my eyes at him.Ultimately, The Protégé was a disappointing viewing experience. While Maggie Q proves her start power, the boring plot and weird casting choices really drag the movie down. In fact, The Protégé proves that if you've seen one assassin movie, you've seen them all. Unfortunately, this one doesn't do much to set itself apart from the pack. I say this is an only streaming option if you are bored - just one popped kernel.",The Protege
66,Luv2Spooge,"As many have said, forgettable movie.",4,28 August 2021,"Not being a fan of John Wick films, this one ranked up there with just another poor writing, poorly executed film. The action scenes are good, but there it lies the problem, they were far way too few. Most of the movie is just talking talking about a very convoluted plot that was hard to follow and made even less sense. Overall, I was bored out of my mind and the movie barely served as a noise maker in the background while I did my work on the computer.If these are the same creators that made Nobody, they really need to study their work and find out what made that one work.",The Protege

Jackson who plays himself... ;)The plot is simple and doesn't bring anything new... but... is so perfectly executed we couldn't care less. Come on is an action movie.And there is the pacing... slow, moderate and fast when and where it should be.So if you're looking for some young bulked up heroes, perfectly shaped beauties, flying cars, in-existent psychics, childish jokes or lame story... this is not for you.It is just a simple, good, 90's style action movie with nice direction and good acting performances.",The Protege

69,PerryAtTheMovies,Maggie Q is perfection making it worth a theatre viewing....,6,20 August 2021,"(My Ratings)
Overall: 65.5/100
IMDb: 6/10
Letterboxd: 3/5The big appreciation I had about this film was the diversity. Although the film takes place in Vietnam for a good portion. There wasn't a heavy hand of white folks (coming from a white guy). There was some good authenticity about where things took place.From an acting point of view, I found that Maggie Q and Samuel L. Truly delivered in this film. Their performances were just below award worthy with their cool gal/cool guy demeanours. They also brought a slight bit of comedy to the film which was enjoyable. Michael Keaton also brought a convincing amount of romanticism to the whole foe vs foe, I want to kill you, but I also want to have sex with you kind of vibe.The action was honestly a lot of fun, as well as, bloody and gruesome at times. For some it may have been over the top, but I enjoyed it. While I can't remember the score I thought visually the movie was stunning. The colour pallet for each and every scene worked. Things just meshed together.While the story made sense it kind of faltered. Even at an hour and half length of time the film dragged on in parts. It took too long explain a sequence, or a flashback just didn't come up at the right time. If a couple of scenes were sped up just a bit or slightly altered perhaps it would've been more enjoyable, but I digress. It is what it is.Overall, I'd recommend seeing this movie in theatres if you're looking for a good action film. Maggie Q delivers an enjoyable performance that will have you rooting for her all the way through. While the score may be forgettable the scenes are truly wonderful with their colour schemes.Not sure what else to tell, but to enjoy the show!",The Protege

She has acted so brilliant that I can't imagine specially her action stunt is marvelous. Even the supporting cast has done a great job. Story wise movie is not upto the mark specially the climax is totally unexpected and not satisfying but the action sequences and the screenplay are top notch. You didn't get bored for one second.

The assassin raises the girl, and they start working together. This is a nice movie full of action scenes. You see a wide variety of locations in the movie. Background music and sound effects are nice. The story is nice and simple. Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, and Maggie Q are awesome in this movie. However, Samuel L. Jackson is amazing like always. He is one of the actors who has a unique style. He can play in different genre movies. For example, he acted in '1408' (made in the year 2007) which is a horror movie. In my opinion, one of his best movies is 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' (made in the year 2014). I recommend this movie to action genre fans.",The Protege

87,guskeller,"the story is unoriginal, the conversations lack wit, and the characters are flat",5,23 August 2021,"The Protégé attempts to make a played out genre its own by adding awkward banter and misfired quips. The action, while fair, is the clear focus of this production because the plot is clunky and uninteresting. This is exacerbated by Maggie Q's bland acting. She tries to achieve the assured demeanor that the script is hoping for but she comes across wooden and forced. This isn't solely her fault since the dialogue wishes it was much cooler than it actually is. But Maggie does not elevate the role in any meaningful way.From a technical perspective, The Protégé is decent enough. The action is the film's redeeming quality because the shot choices, choreography, and special effects are all adequate. Once, the music even enhances a fight scene to highlight juxtaposing emotions at hand. Yet, this is outweighed by the contrived and cringe writing. In almost every way, the script fails the audience because the story is unoriginal, the conversations lack wit, and the characters are flat. Often, The Protégé outright tells us how to feel instead of giving us real reasons to care, leaving viewers to groan at a marginally subpar piece of work.Writing: 2/10

Notably the intro was pretty alright, but after the first part it just became.... very lacklustre.

I can't figure out what's going on like who does Michael Keaton work for and what exactly is Maggie Q looking for. And who is the bad guy and what did he do that they want to kill him as he isn't a terrorist. But then again these kinda films plot don't matter much. You watch it for the action.,The Protege

Lionsgate Films looks to close out the 2021 Summer Movie scene with The Protege. This stylish film is a must see for action film fans.After professional assassin, Samuel L. Jackson, discovers an orphaned girl in Vietnam in 1991 he makes her his Protege'. Jump thirty years later and Maggie Q embarks on an assignment that unfolds into a revenge mission. Michael Keaton stars as an adversary with an elevated interest in this sophisticated, highly educated and intelligent, but deadly woman.It all ties together in a highly watchable and visually interesting action film that is probably best experienced in theaters, but will hold up on streaming and POD.Martin Campbell, who directed the most realistic action film in the James Bond universe, Casino Royale, starring Daniel Craig, as well as Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan's, The Foreigner, is at the helm on this one and he does a great job. The movie is well paced, the plot twists are worth the investment of intellectual capital. The action and fight choreography does not take a second seat. It is the culmination of Campbell's long career in the action genre, with the appropriate comedic accents.The cast is the strength of this one. Samuel L. Jackson is what you expect from him, and that is fine. He has great screen presence. Maggie Q, as the complex and erudite star who is as deadly as anyone in film, is very good. From relative obscurity a decade ago she starred in a number of roles that have culminated in this commanding lead. She plays the part close to the vest; however, reveals enough to have the audience as intrigued in her as Keaton is throughout the film. She is tough and gritty, smart,and sexy. I see more in her near future, including, potentially, additional films in this series.Michael Keaton is the stand out in this one. While, throughout his career, he has challenged the conventional notions of his characterization as a likable comedic lead, he still never ceases to surprise at his range of talent and grit. At almost 70 he evokes strength, and sexuality in the role of a smart and charming hitman that is as deadly as he is personable. Every scene he is in in this film is a delight. His chemistry with Maggie Q, evoking a Mr. & Mrs. Smith vibe makes this more than a gritty action film. Keaton is a huge part of this film's appeal.The supporting cast is solid.In the wake of the John Wick films, and the success of Bob Odenkirk's, Nobody, action film fans have high expectations for action and violence in this genre. This film delivers. Gun fights. Motorcycle chases. Hand to Hand Combat. Interesting stunts. 'The Protege' is an homage to many great action films.The film is Rated R for violence, language, brief nudity, and sexuality.I hope 'The Protege' is the first in the series.",The Protege

Yet, here we are. Diminishing the FEMALE lead to a second fiddle. As a movie, it deserves at least 6 out of 10 (maybe even higher, if you are an action fan), but I give it -10 (below zero) out of 10 for the total disrespect of its real lead. I am not naive.

(the villain actually believed in the death of the assassin and his henchman spared the adopted daughter because he had a crush on her so they were better off let it be but they continued anyways) .The entire movie the hitmen and henchmen working for the villain were wondering why the girl is after them and they kept her alive for that reason for a number of times , meanwhile earlier they just attempted to kill her along with her adopting assassin father without questions just because they learnt that those two were snooping around them .The assassin father (who actually get paid for killing people) was actually tracking the villain to kill him because (mark that well) the villain was evil .The assassin father took his life along with the villain for no apparent reason or threat as the daughter got away from that island with ease .The list goes on and on but I just got bored with it ...P. S : The age gap between Mickael Keaton and Maggie is enough to make him her grand dad but yet the movie ignores that and tries to portray him as a man in his 40s where they both have heats for each other which gives a very odd feeling about it the entire movie (He do look in his 70s) .",The Protege

A 90 pound borderline anorexic woman using her limbs to overpower and kill multiple thugs with automatic weapons.Copy and paste generic storyline we have seen before.

Surprising storyline, but quickly the became some bad ass filthy B movie shootout and very predictable.As was the beginning of the movie also very amateurish when the rooms were searched. Throughout the whole movie I haven't had the idea that you saw professional assassins doing their job as they should do.Also the way the compound was secured. A very bad scene and very bad acting. As if the whole idea of heavy security needs to be shown in just a few seconds.So the balance: a good movie potentially , but due to some bad scenes and acting, it's not worth more than 6 stars out of 10.",The Protege

Maggie Q gives the film credibility with her refinement and elegance......but then we introduce the poor casting......Sam Jackson and Michael Keaton.....both around 70 years of age.....playing assassins as well.....really? Jackson normally plays a big mouth thug.....and Keaton is better suited as a neurotic personality with insecurities. The movie is further cheapened by the introduction of other thuggish characters and an American biker gang led by another has been actor.....which makes no sense in communist Vietnam. The brief affair between Keaton's character and Maggie's also lessens her character's credibility and integrity. As for Jackson's character.....he supposedly ages 30 years in this movie but doesn't look any different!

I think that Rembrandt is still very much alive by the end of the film. As much as he enjoys his time with her, he isn't just going to roll over and let her kill him.

Maggie and Michael are both very charismatic in the movie, and do not phone in their performances. Samuel L Jackson is also good, but his performance is a little more phoned in than our other leads. The action is very good, with realistic hand to hand combat and decent gun play. While it's not the best action in a movie, it's definitely choreographed well and shot competently. I would mainly recommend this movie for Maggie and Michaels performances alone, along with the action scenes.

152,NS_writings,"Good to see you, Mr. Campbell. Things have been awfully dull around here...",9,30 August 2021,"A brilliant film with the potential of being the movie of the year and this incipient decade. I'm sad most media outlets have water in the veins to recognize how brilliant and entertaining 'The Protégé' is and how it empowers women without giving us lectures. While at first it may look at ""just another revenge movie from the same director"" à la 'Edge of Darkness' or 'The Foreigner', this one goes one step further by adding a few interesting twists and surprises through a two-hour journey from Da Nang to Bucharest, London and Da Nang again where it all ends (did it?) where it began. Maggie Q can be sweet and deadly at the same time, while Michael Keaton combines the charm of Pierce Brosnan and Roger Moore in this mysterious character known as Rembrandt. Ray Fearon plays a memorable baddie and Samuel L Jackson brings a good dose of humour. On the downside, I would have hoped the editing to be a little bit more artistic with fades and things like that instead of the abrupt cuts that appear to be Angela Catanzaro's trademark as she showed in 'Foreigner'. Still, she does a very good job in accelerating the film's pace. David Tattersall ""paints"" the film beautifully, making it colorful and exotic - particularly in the scenes set in the orient. Photek's music is quite fitting too.And of course, the biggest merit should go to director Martin Campbell. We've been missing him for four years and he's the filmmaker we need in these times where movies are so adamant with their pretentiousness and overcomplicated scripts. Watching an action film with balanced quantities of drama and humour is refreshing in the age of three-hour films that waste way too much time in explaining themselves to please film students and The Academy.

He didn't even look fluid. I mean Nikita after being tortured and hanged, beat up 4 younger tough guys.I get it that maybe she was not trying as hard against him, but even seeing Keaton fight others or get the drop on her...just couldn't buy it. If she was THAT good, she would have disposed of him quickly...or subdued him.And their dialogue was a bit cringy. Just a strange character to have.It just seemed much more exciting with higher stakes in the fighting before Keaton showed up and they were seemingly messing around a bit.Not the best role for Keaton to me. Samuel Jackson had kind of declined lately in things but I thought he was really good in this.I think they'd be good in serious assasin missions. Samuel Jackson and her or just her...if they had more moviews, but I doubt they will. Some of these good ones like this and Unlocked (Noomi Rapace) with great female leads that could start a franchise seem to fly under the radar while we see multiple John Wick and Equalizer movies...I like them both but I love female leads too.

It's like they set out to make a film without a script, got lost half way through and brought back one of the characters they'd killed off earlier because it was convenient.Why didn't they give Jackson or Keaton anything decent to say?Why didn't they employ somebody who could choreograph a fight scene? I thought this was made by the same people as Bond and John Wick.And who the hell did the casting? There's the skinny yet weirdly podgy and botoxed old white dude leading a biker gang of white dudes in Vietnam, that was ridiculous. There's the very English actor supposedly playing a Frenchman in Vietnam. There's the catwalk model with arms like tooth picks playing the assassin.

She believes the killer is in Viet Nam and she goes there to avenge Moody.Some of this is complicated. We are not sure why Edward Hayes (David Rintoul) faked his death to spare his son of being complicit in Hayes' gangster operations. But that is what he did. Anna finds that Hayes' assistant, Vohl (Patrick Malahide) knows what all is about, but before he can tell her anything lawyer Duquet (Ray Feron) shoots Vohl in the head. Anna attacks Duquet and tries to escape, but Duquet captures and tortures her. Now enter Michael Rembrandt (Michael Keaton) who also works for Edward Hayes. Anna escapes, but now we see an almost different kind of relationship with her and Rembrandt.Part of the complications loom from some scenes that are hard to explain and we are not sure why they are in here. For example the searching for and finding Lucas, the son of Edward Hayes went on for too long. Best to just keep your eye on Anna. Why go after Edward Hayes? Anna believes he was the one who ordered the hit on Moody, but she never had proof of that. However, she did know that Moody was investigating Edward Hayes, but didn't know why.We do see a flashback re Anna's childhood and this shows she can kill the 4-people, who killed her family in front of her. Here we see the beginnings of an Assassin.Many of the fight scenes are extremely brutal. When Anna was captured by Duquet the scenes with a bed sheet to subdue her captors were some of the best I have ever seen. And later when she fights Rembrandt it was so brutal almost to a point I had to check into the ER to make sure I was okay. Yes, stunt people were used and they must have been bruised and hurt for days, maybe more. The fight scenes were over the top brutal, but I have to admit, the choreography for the fight scenes were outstanding. Kudos.Notables: Robert Patrick as Billy Boy a motocycle gang leader, who helps Anna meet with Vohl, who she believes can supply many answers re Edward Hayes; Florin Piersic Jr as Ram, who is a violent Enforcer for Edward Hayes.There is a very big twist that no one saw coming, but you will like it. Guaranteed.This is one of the better Assassin movies. The cast is solid and the pacing is very good. Maybe a little too long with those unnecessary scenes as mentioned above.

Maggie Q and Michael Keaton gave awesome performances which is not surprising. Just the right amount of action with interesting filler in between to keep you hooked. Am honestly surprised the rating of this movie isn't higher. Is a giant leap above other action movies that received higher ratings.,The Protege
179,zmeyer-310-710169,"great action, horrid dialogue",5,12 September 2021,"Title pretty much sums it up. This movie has some pretty cool action sequences (not john wick, but expendables) and maggie's character was solid, believable and badass. The movie convinces you in the beginning then picks away at its own strengths with each minute of uncomfortable cringe dialogue.",The Protege
180,iburakay,Why the same plot over and over again?,4,28 September 2021,Another plot about a badass assassin lady raised by an assassin father figure spiced up with john wick style action. I have seen much better versions of this... Waste of time...,The Protege
181,alvarez_lyle,Making love is irresistible,5,9 September 2021,Spoiler alert: Who would have thought two people killing each other and ended up in bed. That's how crazy this reality is and somehow affected the director's brain. Glad they put it the later part of the movie.,The Protege
182,janbanckaert,Nice Action movie,8,26 September 2021,"Great Action , verry enjoyable. I recommend this movie. We had Fun watching it and that's what counts.",The Protege
183,rcjones-27492,Good storyline,8,22 August 2021,"Liked the storyline. Action was not over the top with a lot of explosions, and unbelievable stunts like most action movies now days.That was a fight scene with Maggie Q and Keaton that looked a bit choreographed and not a natural fight, the one cheasey scene in the movie. This one scene reason I gave it a 8 otherwise would've given it a 9 or 10.",The Protege
184,chrisdye-52882,For a unknown really movie this was incredible,9,28 August 2021,Okay so I'll say for the most part I only saw a couple of trailers for this movie but lemme tell you right now don't let that stop you from going to see it this is an incredible film.that is worth every single pennie of admission so much fun at the boxoffice usually when something is this fun it's heavily advertised but this is definitely not one to miss and it's One of the best action pictures of the year.if not the best action picture.,The Protege

186,dragonscode,time forever lost,1,9 September 2021,"Another john wick movie, throw in some famous names as click bait, unfortunately its a complete waste of time The other reviewers are correct in their points of criticism. Do something else with these two hours its a complete waste.",The Protege

189,freidakumar,Snooze,4,29 August 2021,This movie has a great star cast but the plot ruined it with its over the top need for wanting to shock the movie watchers. I fell asleep trying to keep track and make sense of it.,The Protege
190,draganbsmilevski,Apart from Samuel cameo nothing to offer,5,31 August 2021,Seems like movies these days like to put a familiar face only to make bleak and weak action afterwards. Story is not that impressive. Action scenes are washed up and you can actually see that they were made with stunt actors. It feels like Kill Bill but is nothing but. Bad movie altogether - who makes these movies anyway?,The Protege
191,infinityvrx,Enjoyable,7,30 August 2021,"While the ""revenge"" action plot is nothing new, The Protege does have some notable bright points. Maggie Q and Michael Keaton both bring witty banter and energy to the screen, and Martin Campbell's eye showcases great fight choreography in exotic locations.The Protege does not herald in a new era of action films, but it is a wonderful complement to the current set of John Wick-esque movies out there now. Definitely worth the price of the ticket and concessions. 7/10.",The Protege

Same old, same old, please stop",1,29 October 2021,"They really need to stop with the 98lb unarmed woman defeats team of Special forces marching gun armed men, it's just DUMB. Very accommodating stuntmen to say the least. There is a reason this has never happened in the history of the world. If u believe this u likely believe in the tooth fairy.Anyway, so so plot, but it can be watched for some descent entertainment because we all like Michael Keaton!",The Protege
193,memew-73644,"Even though the base of the storyline is cliche, it is well directed",10,29 August 2021,"For whatever reason, I loved this movie.Samuel Jackson is known for his satire in action movies that I usually don't find it that fascinating (except his role in Avengers and with Leonardo and few others that are not too focused on just Action).There is something different about Samuel Jackson's role compared to other action movies and the direction to me was just really well done.It was definitely a cliche story of a wealthy bad/evil guy and fighting the evil with bad, good, and something in between. Moreover, the soundtrack was decent too and fit well with the storyline, scenes, and screenplay.I am no professional movie critique, but I have watched my fair share of movies to have a certain perspective on this one. Again, its my opinion, and may not be shared by others.",The Protege
194,skippystarla,Could have been worse,4,22 August 2021,"Didn't know anything about it going in, omehow missed all the trailers. Had I have seen one I might have been more upset. Best thing about the movie was Michael Keaton, other than that the dialog was bad so was the choreography and every action movie cliché was accounted for.",The Protege
195,babatundeofficial,Great Watch!,8,30 August 2021,"I am here wondering why this movie is getting so much flak; action-packed, good acting, good scenes and particularly like that it has twists to it, so that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Although, the storyline seems unrealistic.It still makes for a good watch!",The Protege

Just like in the movie ""crank"".8/10 deffently worth watching!",The Protege

204,mradambeesley,Bland and forgettable,4,29 August 2021,I lost interest in the film about half way in due to the plot being extremely uninspired and boring and the pacing being slow and sluggish at times. While I love Samuel L Jackson he adds little to nothing to this film but he did the best with what he was given. The main protagonist lacked any charisma or charm which didn't make me root for her when she walked out of the building as I wasn't actually happy to see her alive. Overall you'll probably forget you have even seen this film after a few weeks and it probably isn't worth your time.,The Protege

206,rdewilde-14265,Good start but lousy ending,6,31 August 2021,"Starting the movie i was impressed, it kept me on my seat. However with the ""comeback"" it went downhill fast. The end was even like they ran out of time and compromised.",The Protege
207,wclark-96598,Littered with plot inconsistencies,4,20 August 2021,"Fun enough for a John Wick style movie, with some really good acting by the main characters. Sadly it couldn't make up for a nonsensical plot that forces the characters into illogical decisions. It also relied heavily on Hollywood's inability to figure out how many bullets a weapon can hold (in one scene a guy literally fires at least 50 rounds from a handgun with no reload.) Bottom line watch it when it streams for free.",The Protege
208,jermysu,Great action and nice story,10,30 August 2021,Over all Maggie Q did a great job. I love the story telling and it was not like others saying it is not being consistence. Bro please watch it with some brain. The hate speech was just sad. Definitely you can tell the production team made a lot of effort in all details if you pay attention to them. Those are where the money went to.,The Protege

It's a movie so doesn't always have to make perfect sense every minute.Great action thruout.. almost a Female John Wick in most scenes.The naysayers are just trying to impress you with there Rodger Ebbert Impersanations. See thru it and watch the movie.. very entertaining..",The Protege
211,kelley-07981,Pleasantly Surprised,9,4 September 2021,"Please note I'm ranking this a 9 in comparison to other assassin movies. This by no means is an Oscar film but when compared to assassin movies I was pleasantly surprised. Typically the theaters will release a handful of assassin movies each year and one is bound to have a female lead. This was it.I loved Maggie Q's performance and I really enjoyed the banter/chemistry between her and Michael Keaton. I felt like this movie tried to tell more of a story versus layering unrealistic fight scene after unrealistic fight scene. Don't get me wrong, you will have plenty to complain about if you are the person that goes to movie to point out all of the inconsistencies. I, on the other hand, enjoy going to movies to suspend reality and be entertained. This movie delivered in my opinion.I do not feel you will be disappointed if you are looking for your average to above average assassin movie. I would not recommend this in theaters if you only go to a handful of movies each year.",The Protege
212,esam-97365,Expected more,4,12 September 2021,"With such big names in the cast, I was expecting more. Was hoping to see more of Keaton and the development of his character.Used to love watching Maggie when she was still refreshing but now she's boring, typecasted and predictable. Like someone said, there seemed to be a challenge for her to bring out the charm for her character which was rather dull and flat.Do better for the sequel.",The Protege
213,noodledoodle-61618,Good Movie,8,25 September 2021,"I read the reviews for this movie and was surprised that some were so negative. I thought the story and Maggie Q's performance were excellent. This movie could easily spin off sequels, just like the first John Wick movie. In fact, I feel like I am watching the female version of John Wick in this movie.Maggie Q: If you read this review, definitely make a sequel!",The Protege
214,maidungx,"Boring, not accurate about Viet Nam",2,30 September 2021,"I'm a Vietnamese and i had to create an account on IMDB to write this review. First, I don't know what the meaning of this movie like. She just killed many people who harmed her friends. And then what after that? Everything about the movie is just killing and killing.What about Vietnam in this movie? I can say Vietnam in this movie is a country that violent, all bad people, dangerous... For one scene that a motorbike gang drives on the road, with no helmet and of course no mask because of covid-19 then shoot people, then they'll be on VTV, Facebook, Tiktok right away.Sometime I can hear some nonsense Vietnamese voices that can match the situation but to me, they all sound awkward, like copy from other movie or clips.And about the beer scene, we don't have any beer like that. And about the Ham Rong Bridge, it's CGI. Da Nang looks like China. And in 1991, Vietnam didn't have electric bike, modern plastic raincoat, polymer coating conical hats.In the border scene, the guard dressed like a joke, honestly. And why people want to go to Cambodia? The movie just shows that for no reason.Please, if you don't come to Vietnam or know nothing about us, then ask. Don't make it up like we are bad people or something.",The Protege

216,fiction-ee,Subpar assassin movie,6,6 October 2021,"It is an subpar assassin movie. But unnecessary violently graphic, and tons of loose ends. Samuel L Jackson and Michael Keaton does good on screen as always, but it is really only worth watching because of Maggie Q.TLDR;
