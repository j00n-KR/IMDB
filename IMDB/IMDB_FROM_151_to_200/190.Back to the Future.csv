0,TheLittleSongbird,So good in so many ways,10,15 April 2010,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Back to the Future
1,Leofwine_draca,An '80s classic that never disappoints,10,9 May 2016,"I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly, a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy, Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and, again, it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today, some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here, just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments, big set-pieces, cutting edge special effects, action, chase scenes, romance, and of course plenty of humour, and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason.",Back to the Future
2,SnoopyStyle,Wonderful story Wonderful Michael J Fox,9,14 October 2013,Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an average teen from a lower middle class family. His friend Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time traveling DeLorean. Dr Brown is about to travel back in time when the Libyans attack. Marty only escapes by using the DeLorean to go back to 1955. He changes history and must change it back before he disappears all together.Robert Zemeckis has woven together a wonderful charming story. It's perfectly constructed time loop. It certainly is one of the best feel good movie. Michael J Fox is the perfect guy to play the boy next door character. His interaction with his mother Lea Thompson in the past is wonderfully hilarious and Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the oddball scientist.,Back to the Future
3,Hitchcoc,So Much Fun,9,15 July 2014,"Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in ""The Good Wife"" as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can ""not like"" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion.",Back to the Future
4,kosmasp,Marty got Back,9,23 May 2020,"Doc Brown and Marty McFly ... character names that are very well known in the Science Fiction movie pantheon I'd say. Any self respecting movie fan should know the names, the actors and the movies that made them famous. Which in case of McFly and the series in general ... could have gone in a completely different direction - literally.Eric Stoltz got cast because the filmmaker could not get Michael J. Fox - had other contractual obligations. This is very well known. That his movie girlfriend was recast too, because the original one wasn't available at first - that I did not know. But it's all there and so much more in the Special features on the discs. Just the beginning of the movie is quite interesting and intriguing, because especially back then, no one knew what this was about. Well apart from the title of course.Very funny movie that sets off something in the careers of everyone involved. Yes the time travel aspect has flaws if you try to apply logic and consequences of certain actions and how they will spin out and what they will do - a ripple effect that is not entirely seen .. which would have been too complicated anyway.So sit back, relax and enjoy a very entertaining and funny movie",Back to the Future
5,classicsoncall,"""Yeah well, history is gonna change.""",8,8 February 2013,"Here's a movie that was entertaining when it came out in the mid-Eighties and once again when I watched it today. The issue I have is with the IMDb ratings system that ranks this picture in the number #48 spot as I write this, with ""Citizen Kane"" at #45 and ""Vertigo"" at #51. For me, this doesn't compute. No one can justify to me how this comedy, sci-fi flick gets honored as one of the Top Fifty movies of all time.Well hopefully, my minor little rant doesn't spoil things for you. I do like the film for it's players and the clever way Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) manages to navigate his way through the Fifties. I became a Christopher Lloyd fan right from the get-go when he made his debut in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and his Reverend Jim character in the 'Taxi' TV series was one of the most original ever. He's got the perfect look and attitude for a crazed scientist and it would have been cool to see him work with classic icons of the horror genre like Karloff, Lugosi and Chaney. That would have been something.The thing that bugs me about the characters a bit are the way George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) are portrayed. They're really more like caricatures, though Biff as the town bully had a certain amount of credibility even if he was annoying. I had forgotten how attractive Lea Thompson was as Lorraine Baines, Marty's future Mom but sporting a major crush on him that conjured up all kinds of potential icky situations, but they were handled tastefully for the most part. The biggest kick for me was when Marvin Berry (Harry Waters Jr.) called his cousin Chuck to check out the new music sensation.So yeah, this is a fun movie and a generally family friendly one that would have been better served if some of the language had been toned down a bit. Some of the time travel stuff goes over the top, like the scene where Marty returns from 1955 and sees himself in the present about to do the time jump. Stuff like that just makes me think about the concept too much. As for the very ending scene, that has got to be about the most blatant set up to scream 'sequel' that I've ever seen.",Back to the Future
6,gavin6942,Gets Better With Age,9,19 November 2014,"A young man (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all.",Back to the Future
7,lee_eisenberg,"Many people may remember Michael J. Fox as Alex Keaton, but I'll always remember him as Marty McFly",7,23 September 2005,"Okay, so maybe ""Back to the Future"" seems a little hokey, but it's so cool! You probably know the story: typical '80s teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back to 1955. His existence is threatened when his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) falls for him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Only the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) can help him. Along the way he has to cope with local bully Biff Tannen.If the movie is excessively nostalgic, then they play it to good effect. I sometimes have to wonder what would happen if I accidentally went back in time and met my parents. Given what happens in this movie, it's probably best that I stay in my own time.Anyway, it's an interesting contrast/comparison between the '50s and '80s. After all, who in the '50s would have imagined Reagan becoming president, or any town having an African-American mayor? So check this movie out; it won't disappoint you.",Back to the Future
8,jboothmillard,Back to the Future,10,16 June 2005,"If you like science-fiction films, then you'll love this from director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) and executive producer Steven Spielberg. Basically Marty McFly (Golden Globe nominated Michael J. Fox) is the young aspiring teenage musician and friend of Dr. 'Doc' Emmet Brown (a fantastic Christopher Lloyd), and finds out that Doc has invented a time machine with a DeLorean car. It is run by tremendous power from plutonium, which he took from the Libyans, who find him and shoot him. When Marty escapes from them in the car and excels to 88mph (the speed needed to time travel) he is transported unintentionally to 1955 (which Doc set). Unfortunately, while looking for Doc to help him get home, he interferes with the history of his parents in this past, where they meet and fall in love, making his mother love him! Marty now not only has to get his parents, George (Crispin Glover, who did not return for the sequels) and Lorraine (Les Thompson) to fall in love again to restore history/the future, before he and his brother and sister are erased from existence, but the only power available instead of plutonium to get him back to the future (1985) is a bolt of lighting that will hit the clock tower (they know this from a paper he brought from 1985). A fantastic look at how time is so precious, and what can change from the tiniest history interference, aka time paradox. By the way, the plutonium was changed to trash in the end to help explain the sequels. Also starring Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker (who was changed in the sequels to Elisabeth Shue) and Titanic's Billy Zane as Match. The story is original and though provoking, the characters are lovable, and the special effects are great, just a great film. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, and it was nominated for Best Song for ""The Power of Love"", Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Screenplay, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Original Song and Best Screenplay. It was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Outstanding!",Back to the Future
9,ccthemovieman-1,Mixed Emotions Looking Back On This Film Today,7,17 February 2008,"When this came out over 20 years ago, I thought It was solid entertainment with a clever story. It was a big hit, and spawned two sequels. I saw it at the theater and several times on VHS. Then, after an absence of time, I saw it again in the late '90s and was shocked to hear 11 blasphemes - a ridiculous amount for a comedy (and ""PG-rated,"" to boot).Also, the character ""Biff"" (Thomas Wilson) was so irritating to me (he must have done a good job acting) it also fun out of viewing. I could say the same about ""Marty's"" father (Crispin Glover), who was a disgusting wuss. I did enjoy seeing Lea Thompson in her prime: a very pretty woman, and there were still a lot of laughs in here. She and Christopher Lloyd's ""Emmet Brown"" are definitely fun to watch. Michael J. Fox became an even-bigger star, thanks to this movie.The mixture of humor, action, drama, special-effects, science-fiction, etc., all made this a film a lot of people enjoyed. Why they had to include all that ""language"" is a mystery to me, except that it's the twisted world of Hollywood.",Back to the Future
10,rmax304823,Amusing and commercial success.,6,20 May 2008,"Good-natured and enjoyable fantasy about Michael J. Fox (as Marty McFly) who travels 30 years into the past with the help of Dr. Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and his magic, plutonium-powered DeLorean.The present -- that is, 1985 -- is a bit of a mess in Fox's small town. What's left of the downtown area is surrounded by strip malls. The two movie theaters are defunct. One has been converted into an evangelical church and the other shows X-rated movies. Homeless bums sleep on the benches of the town square. Fox's mother (Lea Thompson) is an overweight, hopeless alcoholic; his father is a witless nobody constantly abused by a burly friend who exploits him and then insults him for his imperfect efforts.Lloyd is a maniacal scientist who steals plutonium from Lebanese terrorists to fuel his traveling time machine. He's shot by them as Fox barely escapes, zooming into the past.It's 1955 now and we note that the state of the town is rather better in most respects. No garbage on the streets. No suburbs, but farmland ""as far as the eye can see."" A couple of good gags follow, right out of ""The Twilight Zone."" Pull into a gas station and half a dozen employees rush out to service your car. A cup of coffee is five cents. When Fox orders a Tab in the diner, the counter man doesn't know what he's talking about. A ""Pepsi free"" doesn't help.But there are of course the kind of complications that usually follow from time travel. Fox meets his own mother and father, as well as Dr. Brown. The problem is that Fox's mother gets the hots for him and Fox must arrange for his own father to take his place in her affection. In brief, he does so, successfully travels back to 1985, and finds Dr. Brown has paid attention to a warning and worn a bullet-proof vest so he survives the terrorist shooting.I enjoy seeing it once in a while and I gather it was immensely popular. There's just enough profanity to pep things up and keep this from being a movie for children. The plot itself isn't challenging in any way, though some of the gags require a certain maturity to be understood. Someone asks who is president in 1985. ""Ronald Regan? The actor? Who's vice president -- Jerry Lewis?"" Fox is a convincing high-schooler and easy to identify with. Christopher Lloyd is overly manic and with his bulging eyes resembles a creature out of the very depths of the ocean. Lea Thompson doesn't add much, but Chrispin Glover as Fox's father seems all flapping arms and legs.I think it might have been more enjoyable if the anachronisms had been spread throughout the movie instead of being all crowded into the first ten minutes or so of the 1955 period. Some of the comedy was thrown away in the interests of special-effects and pseudo-drama. (Think of ""Groundhog Day,"" in which all the elements are seamlessly blended.) And it also appears that McFly adapts too readily to 1955. After the first few minutes, nothing surprises him. He takes this extraordinary experience for granted and simply goes about the business of bringing his parents together and figuring out a way to get back to his real ""present"" before his picture disappears from the snapshot he's brought along with him. (?) I'd have been taking notes every minute. A few liberties are also taken with the norms of 1955. Good girls, like Lea Thompson, didn't reach under the table to squeeze a stranger's thigh. At least none of them did that with me. And if theywouldn't have done it with me, they obviously wouldn't have done it to anyone. Except -- and this is probably the answer -- Lea Thompson was a slut to begin with. Yes, that must be it. How disgusting.Anyway, you'll have fun watching the film. The kids will too. It generated three sequels, none of which I've watched.",Back to the Future
11,Tweekums,Great sci-fi adventure for all the family,9,11 July 2009,"One would have thought that a film made almost twenty five years ago about somebody travelling back in time thirty years would have dated terribly but it seems just as fresh now as when I first saw in on betamax all those years ago. I'm sure people will be enjoying it for decades to come.Michael J. Fox will almost certainly be best remembered for his role as Marty McFly, the eighties teenager who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a converted DeLorean. While much of the humour is derived from the differences between the two eras that isn't over done and it doesn't get in the way of the main plot. Not only must Marty enlist the help of his friend Dr. Brown to get him back to 1985 he must get his parents to fall in love all over again because he accidentally stopped their first meeting. This problem seems to be greater than time travel as his father is the school wimp who is constantly being harassed by the school bully Biff Tannen and his mother has fallen for him.The supporting cast do a great job too, especially Christopher Lloyd is the archetypal mad scientist Dr Brown and Lea Thompson as Marty's mother who is rather prudish in the eighties but clearly knew how to have a good time when she was a teenager.. much to Marty's surprise. In a time before everything was done with CGI the effects are great and not overused. I'd recommend this film, along with its two sequels to anybody with a sense of humour.",Back to the Future
12,BA_Harrison,A film you can watch time and time again.,10,20 November 2010,"My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too.

13,paul_haakonsen,Great Scott! Strap in for some entertaining time travel...,10,27 March 2019,"The 1985 movie ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a timeless - pardon the pun - classic. It truly is a movie that has withstood with the trials of time and proves to be a movie that you can watch again and again and it actually never loses its appeal or charm.Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale managed to put together a very original story here, one that captivates the audience from the very beginning and keeps a grip on the audience until the very end. The story told in ""Back to the Future"" is a story that has so many aspects and so many topics that there definitely is something that appeal to everyone in the audience; ranging from romance, action to science fiction.There is a great pacing to the movie, and director Robert Zemeckis ensured that the movie never left momentum or dropped down in its pacing. This definitely made the movie all the more enjoyable and certainly ensured that the movie can be watched again and again.The movie is packed with great actors and actresses. Of course the movie is so phenomenally well carried by Michael J. Fox in the lead role as Marty McFly, and he definitely made that character lovable and memorable. But right up alongside Fox was Christopher Lloyd in the memorable role as the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown. Who can't claim to be familiar with the expression ""Great Scott!""? Furthermore, the movie also brought along Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, whom individually also brought a lot of contents to the movie with their appearances and performances.I can't count the number of times that I have watched this movie, nor the other two in the franchise for that matter. But the original 1985 ""Back to the Future"" is a classic in every meaning of the word.While the movie is from 1985, then the special effects still holds solid even in 2019. Sure they wear symptoms of aging, certainly, but still the special effects are quite good. And back in 1985, they were off the charts.If you, for some unknown reason, never have gotten acquainted with ""Back to the Future"", then shame on you. This is a movie that you HAVE to watch. ""Back to the Future"" is one of those movies that you need to watch regardless of your age, creed and standing.",Back to the Future
14,Quinoa1984,Old Man Peabody owned all of this!,10,8 July 2000,"This is a memorable sci-fi comedy that will always be remembered for it's amazing visual effects and dolorian time machine.  Plot (if actually memorable) is about a regular teen (Michael J. Fox in one of his best performances) who is friends with a brilliant yet crazed doc (Christopher Lloyd is terrific as this Doc) who creates a time machine using a flux capasitor and 1.21 gigawots (what the hell is a giawot!).  But suddenly, McFly finds himself in 1955, 30 years earlier to his present date.  And not only does he have to get back to the future, he also has to reunite his parents after a incident.  Great fun with this cast and tale, with some great direction by Robert Zemeckis and from Steven Spielberg's Amblin entertainment.  The best one of the trilogy (though the other 2 are questionable).

15,tavm,"After 30 years, the original Back to the Future is still the best of the series!",10,21 October 2015,"Today was the day me and my best friend from high school-who now works at the movie theatre that is showing these Back to the Future trilogies-saw these again, a little more than 30 years after this first one initially came out. Because the second one took place partially on October 21, 2015 was the reason for this series playing for that one day. Anyway, this first one was the best of them mainly because of the contrast between teen Marty McFly's '80s lifestyle and that of his parents' when they were teens in the '50s. Also, his relationship with Doc Brown was also a big part of the movie's phenomenal success. That and plenty of jokes about culture shock and great chase scenes. My favorite scene involved Marty playing heavy metal licks at the '50s dance sequence. And what great players like Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd handling their roles the way they do! And, yes, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson are also fine as Marty's parents and his father's bully, respectively. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale fashioned a fine screenplay with excellent direction from Zemeckis. This is still my favorite '80s movie, bar none! So on that note, I definitely highly recommend Back to the Future. P.S. One of the most interesting things I now know about this movie is that the younger brother of Lorraine in the '50s sequence was played by Jason Hervey who was also in the other summer blockbuster of the summer of '85-Pee Wee's Big Adventure-and would later play Kevin Arnold's older brother, Wayne, on ""The Wonder Years"".",Back to the Future
16,ComedyFan2010,A time travel movie that never gets old.,10,25 March 2014,"The movie takes us on a great time travel where a teenager McFly meets his parents when they were teenagers. He both needs to get back to 1985 but before that to get his parents to fall in love with each other so he doesn't get erased from the existence.The movie is absolutely great. It has so much energy and there is always something happening. It is also great to look into the past. Nowadays 1985 is old times as well so the movie has twice the charm when we get to see both the 80's and the 50's. And the writers did a great job to make jokes to show us the differences between those times. Even as somebody who hasn't lived in the 50's I could get them, and the jokes about let's say Marty's 80's vest are even more hilarious to us now. So the movie aged very well, if it didn't even get better.The casting is also perfect. Michael J. Fox is the right actor for Marty. He was not the one cast at first but I am so glad they got him. Even though Eric Stoltz is a great actor, but the footage with him from Back to the Future had a more serious feeling to it, it kind of was losing the charm I love so much. Maybe then there would be no other sequels.Christopher Lloyd created a great persona as Doc. If I see a picture of him I would always recognize him. He always has this great crazy scientist in him. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover who played Marty's parents made a wonderful performance by being them at different ages. The make up artists also contributed to the success of it.I loved this movie as a kid, I love it now. It has everything that I like for such a genre: great cast, a fun story, great lines, well connected plot and perfect time setting. One of the movies I can watch again and again.",Back to the Future
17,BandSAboutMovies,Great!,8,6 June 2021,"Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis came up with Back to the Future five years before it got made, but at that time, it wasn't raunchy enough to get greenlit. After their film Used Cars came out, Gale was looking through his father's high school yearbook. His mother wondered if he would have been friends with his father. Time travel was the only way they'd get the answer.The duo wanted to make a time travel film that showed that the past could change the future. And sure, Professor Brown was once a video pirate and the time machine was going to be powered by Coke, but the main story remained the same as the movie was finally sold.Then the movie went into turnaround and forty different studios turned down the movie. Other time travel films like Time Bandits and The Final Countdown had underpeformed and Disney was put off by the fact that the hero made out with his mom. I mean, well, yeah.Steven Spielberg believed in them and the script. And that ended up being enough.That and the fact that Zemeckis had a success with Romancing the Stone and had the clout to make the movie. And a grudge against the studios who turned him down, so he sold the movie to Spielberg's Amblin, who set the project up at Universal Studios. However, that's also where Frank Price, the first person to say no, worked. Spielberg didn't like Price either - he'd passed on E. T. - so Sidney Sheinberg became the chief executive to oversee the studio's investment.For his part, Sheinberg wanted to rename the movie Space Man from Pluto because he believed Back to the Future wouldn't sell. Everyone worried how to deal with the venerable elder man until Spielberg diffused the situation by sending a funny memo that said, ""Hi Sid, thanks for your most humorous memo, we all got a big laugh out of it, keep 'em coming.""Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but the producers of his hit show Family Ties didn't even let him see the script. Eric Stoltz ended up with the role, but he was too intense. The filmmakers realized they hired a great actor for the wrong role. Stoltz also was a method actor and stayed in character the entire time, refusing to answer to any name but Marty, which led to the crew hating him. 34 days of shooting were lost - they kept shooting with the actor despite Fox being hired - and Stoltz was paid his entire salary.Another perhaps exaggerated story is that Thomas F. Wilson, who played Biff, almost had his collarbone broken in the scene where he fights Marty in the cafeteria. Take after take, despite Wilson asking Stoltz to calm down, the actor kept roughing him up. Wilson planned to get a reciept in the car parking scene outside the dance, but Stoltz was gone before that happened.Despite the issues behind the movie, audiences loved the story of Marty McFly going back in time thanks to Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and having to put back together the events that introduced his parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover). What audieces really liked was the DeLorean, a car that was unlike any time machine they'd ever seen in a movie before.The one thing I never liked about this movie is that it posits that a white man now creates rock and roll. I know it's a minor part, but even as a kid, it upset me.Speaking of music, when Marty pretends to be Darth Vader from the planet Vulcan, he plays a tape labelled ""Edward Van Halen."" It's not any existing Van Halen song, but an untitled song that was written for The Wild Life, which also starred Eric Stoltz (and where producers discovered Lea Thompson as they studied Stoltz's work).",Back to the Future
18,Coventry,Brilliant Scenario!,10,29 June 2008,"Few things are as difficult to accomplish as a movie dealing with time-traveling. To take on themes as risky as paradoxes and time loops you primarily need a healthy dose of courage and ambition, but most importantly loads of writing talent and cinematic vision. The scenario of ""Back to the Future"", courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Bob Gale, is honestly one of the most brilliant ones ever penned down and, thanks to the financial support of several acclaimed producers (including Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall), it also became one of the most massively entertaining films of all time, with sublime special & sound effects, diversity of genres and some of the greatest casting choices and acting performances ever. ""Back to the Future"" is quintessentially speaking a Sci-Fi comedy, but Robert Zemeckis admirably also hints at the more emotional and melodramatic aspects regarding time traveling. Also, even though the film boosts some of the greatest effects ever, their use merely remains functional and occasionally, so that the emphasis continuously lies on the story and the development of the characters instead of on flamboyant machinery and overlong speeches about scientific theories. The DeLorean is a stylish and original piece of scenery, but other than the fantastic and already legendary vehicle there are no giant laboratories with thousands of flickering lights. Marty McFly is a typical mid-80's teenager with a skateboard he knows how to use and a delightful high school sweetheart that loves him very much. His parents George and Lorraine, however, are a pitiable and hopelessly old-fashioned couple and thus he spends most of his free time with his genius but slightly eccentric friend Doc Brown. The latter invented a time-traveling device and, following a series of bizarre events, Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future, but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear, either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works, the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face, you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances, but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions, he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover.

It was directed by Robert Zemeckis, written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale, produced by Steven Spielberg, and starred Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. The film tells the story of Marty McFly, a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time from 1985 to 1955. He meets his future-parents in high school and accidentally attracts his future mother's romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by causing his parents-to-be to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, he must find a way to return to 1985.Contemporary high schooler Marty McFly doesn't have the most pleasant of lives. Browbeaten by his principal at school, Marty must also endure the acrimonious relationship between his nerdy father and his lovely mother (Lea Thompson), who in turn suffer the bullying of middle-aged jerk Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's dad's supervisor. The one balm in Marty's life is his friendship with eccentric scientist Doc, who at present is working on a time machine. Accidentally zapped back into the 1950s, Marty inadvertently interferes with the budding romance of his now- teen-aged parents. Our hero must now reunite his parents-to-be, lest he cease to exist in the 1980s. It won't be easy, especially with the loutish Biff, now also a teenager, complicating matters. Beyond its dazzling special effects, the best element of Back to the Future is the performance of Michael J. Fox, who finds himself in the quagmire of surviving the white-bread 1950s with a hip 1980s mindset.Back to the Future cemented the box-office bankability of both Fox and the film's director, Robert Zemeckis, who went on to helm two equally exhilarating sequels. Performances by the earnest Fox, the lunatic Lloyd, the deceptively passionate Lea Thompson, and, particularly, the bumbling-to-confident Glover, who runs away with the picture, merrily keep the ship sailing.While Zemeckis is able both to keep the story moving and to keep it from going too far. He handles Back to the Future with the kind of inventiveness that indicates he will be spinning funny, whimsical tall tales for a long time to come.Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, it is rousing a time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.",Back to the Future

I don't think it could ever meet the hype that people put on it, but i can't deny that it is a good film, and certainly one of the iconic ones of the 80's.It's a bit overly long though, and I think it could have been in need of tighter editing, but you can't argue with the quality and performances given by the cast.I enjoyed this film, I thought it was clever, but I can't say it'll be a film I return to regularly.",Back to the Future

22,hitchcockthelegend,Earth Angel And The Nuclear DeLorean.,10,14 November 2009,"It's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.It's honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it's the cast that seal the deal for why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson & Crispin Glover are the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to the excellently constructed story.Made for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you really can't argue with. It's snappy, happy and down right funny, so really, if you don't like Back To The Future then seek medical help immediately. 10/10",Back to the Future
23,Hey_Sweden,1.21 gigawatts worth of entertainment.,8,28 January 2021,"Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager of the 80s, albeit a kid with a friendship with a kooky scientist / inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). One Saturday, very early in the morning, Doc unveils his latest invention: a time machine (fashioned out of a DeLorean) that actually works! When Marty is forced to get inside and take it for a spin, he is transported back to 1955. While temporarily trapped in the past, he manages to interfere in what would have been the fateful union of his parents (Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover). So now his problems are twofold: getting back to his own time AND making sure that his parents get together. Otherwise, HE won't exist!""Back to the Future"" is one of the great, iconic 80s films, a blissfully wacky time-travel comedy that gets a lot of mileage out of plunging the affable Marty into a different time period. Here, he has to learn how to blend in so he doesn't stick out so much. The ingenious script is courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and his writing partner, Bob Gale, which comes up with plenty of great scenes and some hilarious lines. ""Why are things so ""heavy"" in the future? Is there a problem with the Earths' gravitational pull?"" The period recreation, done on the Universal backlot, is tons of fun, the music score by Alan Silvestri is tremendously good and memorable, and fairly decent makeup transforms a few of the actors into alternate ""past"" and ""present"" versions of their characters. Although running a little long at just under two hours, ""Back to the Future"" wastes little time, managing to hold your attention while it gets up to its top speed.The cast couldn't be better. Fox is extremely engaging as our flustered hero, and Lloyd is just a delight as the guy who gets the ball rolling in terms of plot. Thompson and Glover are endearing, even if the latter can't help but inject some of his standard eccentricities into his role. Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as swaggering bully Biff. ""Why don't you make like a tree...and get out of here."" The supporting cast is full of familiar faces: Zemeckis regulars Marc McClure and Wendie Jo Sperber as Marty's siblings, Billy Zane and Casey Siemaszko among the members of Biffs' gang, George DiCenzo and Frances Lee McCain as Lorraines' parents, James Tolkan as slacker-hating principal Mr. Strickland, Will Hare as old farmer Mr. Peabody, Buck Flower in one of his many hobo roles, etc. Music star Huey Lewis, who performs the films' hit song ""The Power of Love"", has a cameo as a teacher who tells Marty that his bands' music is ""too loud"".With a high energy level, a large amount of humour that actually works, and excellent visual effects by those pros at Industrial Light & Magic, ""Back to the Future"" has proven to have real legs in terms of its enduring entertainment value.Followed by two sequels and an animated TV series.Eight out of 10.",Back to the Future
24,Doylenf,The kind of time travel fun film you can see again and again!!!,8,13 August 2006,"If any film endeared MICHAEL J. FOX to movie audiences, it was BACK TO THE FUTURE ('85). He was an inspired choice to play Marty McFly, who meets up with crazy wizard scientist Doc Brown (CHRISTOPHER LLOYD) and finds himself living in small-town USA circa 1955 where he discovers that he must arrange a match between his parents who haven't yet connected.Lloyd plays Doc with wild-eyed enthusiasm, a stroke of genius for such an over-the-top kind of role. Completely in harmony with him is CRISPIN GLOVER as Marty's nerdy father, a joy to watch as he completely becomes this character. Then too, an added source of enjoyment is LEAH THOMPSON as Marty's mother/girlfriend who takes part in some of the most innocently funny ""incest"" routines ever--and somehow, none of it manages to offend. It's all played for laughs and all of it works.Discovering that another actor originally started the Marty role and was then tossed aside (he was too intense and felt uncomfortable in the role), it's a wise decision that found MICHAEL J. FOX landing the role and keeping the whole story fresh, funny and innocent. He's an actor who tells you with his whole body what he is thinking--and his expressive face gets quite a workout when the plot thickens.My favorite time travel movie has the wildest climax imaginable, all very clever and full of inventive surprises. Don't miss this one.And last but not least: Thomas F.

25,preppy-3,Shouldn't work...but it does,9,29 July 2005,"HUGE 1980s hit movie. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his breakthrough role) has a miserable life. His father is a wimp, his mother an alcoholic and they live in a rundown area. His only friend is a crazy scientist (Christopher Lloyd). Lloyd turns a DeLorean into a time machine (don't ask) and Fox accidentally ends up in 1955. He also accidentally fumbles his parents first meeting--so his mom is falling for him! He has to get his parents together...or he won't exist. And how is he going to get back to 1985?Sounds silly but this actually is a lot of fun. The direction is good and the script is fast and very funny--I LOVED Lloyd's reaction to Reagan being president and Fox dealing with 1950s life. Also the 1950s outfits and cars are incredible. SPOILER!!! It does go a little too far at the end with Fox supposedly inspiring Chuck Berry--but that's a small complaint. END SPOILER!!! The acting is good. Fox and Lloyd are both great and play off each other very well--some of Fox's dead pan expressions to Lloyds ravings are quite funny. And Fox is so YOUNG! Lea Thompson was excellent playing Fox's mother--she convincingly ages herself AND looks like a teenager. Crispin Glover overdoes it though as Fox's father--TOO over the top. Also great to see Frances Lee McCain playing Thompson's mother--this woman is a great actress and played mothers through many great 1980s film (like ""Footloose"", ""Gremlins"", ""Stand By Me"" and into the 90s with ""Scream""). Also Billy Zane (in his first role) appears as a bully--but has no dialogue.Only two things spoil this a little. The open ending (it ends with ""to be continued..."") and the constant product placement--I know a lot of movies do it but here it was virtually nonstop! When it starts calling attention to itself that's a problem.Also Huey Lewis and the News (remember them?) had a big hit with the opening song ""The Power of Love"".

The comedy is sharp and witty; it's got the best guitar performance from an actor you are ever likely to see and a great theme from Alan Silvestri.

The characters tend to be well-done, if there are some really obvious stereotypes(but it seems intentional). Humor works pretty well, if it can be really silly and goofy at times. The dialog is good, some really memorable lines. You always understand the ""science"" aspect, without a lot of wordy explanations, and there is no technobabble. The music is catchy. Acting is great, other than some over the top performances(again, they didn't happen by accident). It's a fun, rewatchable High School comedy flick with time-travel.

The ads before the film were pin-sharp and very impressive. BTTF certainly looked good, but I didn't go ""Wow!"" at the image quality.This hardly mattered. Despite its familiarity, BTTF sucked me in at the first frame and didn't release me until the very last. This is one of those films with a delicious concept and fabulous execution. It is not perfect, but it comes close.If I had to come up with criticisms, the minor - very minor! - points I would raise are: 1. ILM's effects, just before the digital age, are still good but could be done better now (the first set of fire strips below Doc and Marty at the Mall, for instance). Likewise the facial prosthetics; 2. Crispin Glover's George McFly is a touch overcooked throughout most of the film. Not until the punch and afterwards does George convince; 3. The episode with Biff berating George in the McFly house in 1985 serves two purposes: it loads up material to be revisited later (when the dialogue repeats in the diner in 1955), but it also illuminates George's and Biff's character, and the relationship between them. The first 20 minutes or so is packed with details like this, and necessarily so, but not all of it is delivered gracefully under the guise of character exposition (the Peabody reference comes to mind, clumsily lobbed into conversation for no particular purpose, just to reference the name on the mailbox later on); 4. Having been stunned into open-mouthed disbelief at encountering younger versions of his father, mother, Biff, and Goldie(!), Marty doesn't register his grandparents with any sense of wonder, and this doesn't ring true (he would have had some sort of reaction whether they were still alive in 1985 or not).I'm nitpicking.

33,AlsExGal,"Lots of fun, just don't think too hard",9,5 August 2016,"Why will this film be remembered? Well, I'd say the strength and chemistry of the characters alone makes it an eight. This film was perfectly cast even down to the supporting characters. Then there is that marvelous score that reflects the atmosphere and energy of the entire film and is immediately recognizable. And although the overall ground of time travel has been trodden before, this one addresses time travel and its implications on so many levels. There is the main story arc, but then there are lots of little ripples going out to the universe as a result of the present interacting with the past that you may have to watch it several times to catch all of the changes and all of the jokes.Besides time travel, this one merges in questions about self-esteem and how it is built or destroyed, and how it changes things to EARN the girl instead of having her handed to you through a trick of fate and actually your own moral failings, along with some great action scenes and edge of your chair suspense. Also, it demonstrates what you've always suspected - that your parents were probably quite different as teenagers than they have told you. Heck, they probably even THINK they are telling you the truth! Still there is some stuff that just bugs me - just enough to knock one star off of the film from a perfect ten. Someone smart enough to build a time machine (Christopher Lloyd as the loopy Dr. Brown) does not know that Christ was not born on 12/25/0000? People being erased from existence in order of birth as a result of messing up the past? And why would George hang around in a town working at a job where Biff, the town bully, continues to dog him for thirty years past high school? Why not leave town, or at least spike Biff's drink with some untraceable poison at the company Christmas party that produces a death that looks like a heart attack while George laughs maniacally (in private of course)? But now we are talking a different genre of film aren't we? Plus, why are Marty's brother and sister exactly how you would expect them to turn out given Dad's lack of self esteem and mom's unhappiness with her situation, but Marty has turned out to be this normal kid, an apple falling far from the tree? And I really think that Chuck Berry wrote every song he wrote without any help from a time traveler. The only answer to all of these questions but the Christmas one is that these things have to happen or else the story cannot play out as cleverly as it does. I'll let you watch and see how it plays out.But first I have to set up the story for you. Michael J. Fox plays Marty, a normal kid who hails from a dysfunctional family of underachievers, and whose parents sole reason for being married seems to be that mom's father ran over dad with his car. Marty befriends Doc Brown, a guy who over the years has sold the entire family fortune he inherited in building his time machine. He finally accomplishes this, but to do so he needs plutonium, which he steals from some Libyans. Unfortunately the Libyans show up at the Twin Pines Mall where doc and Marty are about to give the time machine a test drive - it is in automobile form, a DeLorean to be specific. To get away from the terrorists, Marty has to use the time machine as a getaway car. In the process he crosses the speed threshold that sends the time machine into the date it was last programmed for, which happens to be the date his parents met back in 1955. Marty's only hope is to go find his friend Doc Brown, as a young man, in hopes Doc can help him, even as Doc lies dead in 1985, shot by the Libyans. Well, it gets complicated, but you'll enjoy every minute of this film that manages to be so 80's even when it is in the 50s.",Back to the Future

The problem is that his future mother falls for him. Creative and charming with grand humour to boot. Director Robert Zemeckis gives it a nice appeal in the same vein as the famous Frank Capra classics.

This is mainly due to Christopher Lloyd than anything else, the man brings real energy to his role. Michael J. Fox was good to in the lead role, one has to wonder if ""Family Ties"" held him back a little as he had some rather successful movies during the 80's and could have done more without the television commitment. This one is about time travel, time travel to the past. The next film would feature time travel to the future and the past. That one is a film I can not watch, it is just to hard to for me. It also has not aged well as the future they paint is a future of the 80's, as fashion is never going to be like that I am afraid. This one though has a guy use the professor's time machine and ending back in the past where he kind of interrupts the first meeting of his mother and father. This in turn makes it so he may no longer exist shortly. Thankfully, the professor is around and so he has to work on getting the time machine, which is a car, in working order and Fox has to work on getting his parents back on the right track.

38,The_Void,The quintessential eighties time capsule,9,23 December 2004,"Back to the Future is the quintessential eighties movie. It's over the top, kitschy, silly and lots of fun; pretty much what eighties movie making was all about. However, despite being an eighties time capsule; this movie is still well received to this day and will continue to be fun for cinema audiences for generations to come. The reason? Because in spite of being a predominantly fun flick; Back to the Future is a complete piece of cinema. It has it's heart in the right place, it's very funny, it draws themes and parallels from how times have changed, it has interesting characters that you can feel for and it's a lot of fun. Back to the Future is a masterpiece in it's field for all these reasons. We follow Marty McFly; a young slacker who is good friends with a genius inventor, Doc Brown. The fun starts when Dr Brown invents a time machine from a Delorian automobile and after certain events transpire, Marty finds himself in 1955...with his parents as teenagers and without any means to get back to 1985.The idea of going back in time and meeting your parents when they were young is an intriguing one for sure, and this film makes best use of that fascinating (not to mention hilarious) idea, as Marty finds himself the object of his mother's affections. This sort of premise writes itself, and it's so delicious that there's no way it can fail, and fail is anything but what it does. This situation that the movie creates proves itself to be constantly entertaining and the film draws most of it's jokes and parodies from it. The film also details how the things we do can have massive repercussions on our future; but again, it does it with a huge smile on it's face. I'm a big believer that movies don't have to be entirely serious to have a point, and this movie proves that. Also of note is the way that Back to the Future draws parallels between how things were, and how they have changed. It's just little things, like the way Doc Brown confusingly asks if there's a gravity problem in the future after Marty's continual references to events being 'heavy'.Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly and does a great job with it. This actor was born to play this role; he completely looks and acts the part that you would expect this character to be, and for that reason; he is one of the finest casting choices of all time. Just like the Delorian motor company, Fox never got another good gig after this film, which is an ode to how well cast he was. Also like Fox, Christopher Lloyd's role in this film was the making - and the ending - of his career. He is so magnificent and so well fit to the role of the Doc that it's hard to imagine him doing any other type of role. It's a shame for him, but a treat for the audience. Further great castings include Crispin Glover as Marty's dad, George and Lea Thompson, who is all smiles and sweetness as his not bad looking at all, mother.Back to the Future is, if you'll excuse the pun, a timeless classic. It is fit to be enjoyed by people of all ages and generations, and the fact that it's very much an eighties movie never gets in it's way.",Back to the Future

Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films.",Back to the Future
40,Mr-Fusion,Everything that's great about the '80s. And cinema.,10,4 July 2015,"Now here's a film that manages to engender nostalgia for two different decades, while still remaining timeless. You don't see that every day. Strip away the ILM effects, space-time wrinkles and polished veneer and ""Back to the Future"" is really just about a kid witnessing his loser middle-aged parents during their high school years. It's such a novel idea and the movie that builds on that is just so precisely tuned. This was never a big effects movie and never promised huge Summer spectacle, but it does offer the honest thrill of going on an adventure. And that's tough to beat. It's got everything: action, science fiction, comedy, a teen movie subplot and (most importantly) an endearing relationship between two memorable characters (and let me say this right now: Christopher Lloyd steals every one of his scenes).For me, this is the total package of pure entertainment. It's lodged itself into the cultural lexicon and for very good reason. ""Back to the Future"" has been my favorite for years, and I just don't see that changing anytime soon. This is my idea of a perfect movie.10/10",Back to the Future

42,Smells_Like_Cheese,Part 1-Goodness gracious! Great balls of fire!,10,1 December 2006,"I just asked my friend that I'm speaking with through instant messenger if he had ever seen ""Back to the Future"" and he said ""Yeah, who hasn't?"", sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I've seen the movies now! Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.10/10",Back to the Future
43,blanbrn,"One of the best sci-fi, adventure, fantasy, films of all-time. Very memorable and unforgettable film that makes you wish time travel were real!",8,9 May 2009,"Since first seeing this classic in 1985 and thru the years from premium cable, TV network, video, DVD, and cable showings ""Back to the Future"" has always been an enjoyable film. I've saw it enough many times and whether it be with family or by myself I still enjoy. Clearly the film is well liked for it's theme even though time travel is fantasy, still when blended with adventure and great sci-fi special effects ""Back to the Future"" is without a doubt a memorable classic.Directed by film master and genius Steven Spielberg along with special effects wizard Robert Zemeckis they helped make this film one of the most groundbreaking works of all-time. And the story is a catch even though mostly wrapped up in fantasy still the time travel plot sells to all of our hearts making us fall in love with the time travel fantasy. 1980's TV star Michael J. Fox(""Family Ties"")stars as teen Marty McFly a down on his luck and out of touch high school slacking teenager who's only hope of escape in his present day 1985 is his love of rock music and being buddies with his sidekick wild scientist Dr. Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Yet both feel history is about to change as Doc Brown has created a time machine inside his DeLorean car. Oddly this is groundbreaking yet both become mixed up in a time shattering chain reaction that could keep them stuck in the past with a vaporized future.Strangely they travel back to 1955 at a critical time when Marty's parents had yet to meet. During this time conflict and danger is abound as Marty has to be careful not to expose to much of his identity to his important past, because that is his critical future that he must protect from obstacles. In the past it was fun to see Marty having to force his parents to get together, and plus putting up with old high school bully Biff was entertaining and comical.Lessons learned from this movie is time travel though fun and interesting like seeing the past of your hometown and the fact that you would get to meet your parents before they conceived you would be great, still when facing the conflicts of identity exposure and dealing with past pest(Biff) and unexpected events would be very dangerous and risky. Still ""Back to the Future"" is now an immortalized pop culture film classic coming along in a time the mid 80's that showcased and interesting fantasy plot of time travel that filled our entertainment thirst. As it was such a memorable and well liked film for showing that it would be nice and such a dream for anyone to go back and see important things in their past while in the meantime it's such a good feel to be able to shape things in your past that lead to a happy future just like Marty's character did in the film. The adventure and action special effects blend in well with the fantasy theme to make ""Back to the Future"" a film that's unforgettable, memorable and one that will certainly stand the test of time!",Back to the Future
44,DKosty123,A Wild Ride with A Gigawatt Kick,8,10 January 2006,"This film has a pace & magnificence which transcends major holes in the plot/ script. Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd are at the top of their careers in this film. They have capable support although the sequels proved that even though Crispin Glover has a good sized supporting role in this film, he really does not add anything by his presence as he is not even missed in the sequels. He did sue producers for the using stock footage of him in the sequels & won the suit, but he'd have been better off to have appeared in the films because he is now much in danger of being referred to as Crispin who? I love the Huey Lewis songs in this first installment. It is nearly impossible to write a time travel film & get it right but you love the main characters & the music so much that you don't care but some obvious ones include Marty McFly paying for coffee in a 1950's Cafe with 1980's money. The license plate coming off the car when they transport Einstein is a great effect but also makes no sense. The changes in the photo of the McFly kids make no sense as why would only the oldest son be effected by problems in the space-time continuum? Humor is a main ingredient of this movie. From classics like how to open a Coke bottle in the 1950's to ""who the hell is John F Kenedy?"" to Pepsi Free, there is humor throughout the film. I like the Fox - Llloyd quotes:""You built a time machine out of a Deloran?"" ""The way I see it, if your going to travel through time you gotta do it with some style!""The people who carry this film are Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd who is really over the top.

Yes it's great to watch if you enjoy good comedy, science fiction and are interested in the concept of time travel.I was 13 years old in 1985 and, like most kids who watched this film, I wanted a really super cool time traveling delorean just like Doc and Marty. The idea of time travel will get you thinking and wishing you could go back in time. It seems like a lot of fun but the paradoxes that time travel could create might be a bit bizarre just as Doc (Lloyd) and Marty (Fox) found out.This sci-fi is a wonderful classic and is still great by today's film standards.10/10",Back to the Future
46,KineticSeoul,A blast from the past!,9,28 May 2014,"If you wanna watch a very intelligent time travel movie, this one isn't it. However if you wanna see the beginning of a fantastic, adventurous yet well interwoven, grafted and entertaining time travel trilogy this one is the ticket. The thing that makes this movie stand out and endure the test of time is the classic elements that makes a movie such as this memorable with likable characters. And a mission you actually care about as the audience members. Michael J. Fox is just great a Marty McFly who may seem like a typical 80's main teenage character, but there is certain aspects about him that makes him a cool and stands out from the rest. Maybe it's his capability to stand up to bullies even if he is smaller in stature. While also having the courage to follow his dreams and how he conducts himself, despite his flaws of not being able to turn down a challenge. But Christopher Lloyd is the guy that just plain downright nailed it as the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown. Even when it came down to the main villain Biff played by Biff Tannen, who is basically a generic bad guy of this trilogy, but certain elements makes him kind of a stand out villain for me. Maybe because you can see different versions of him, even if he is the bad guy all the way through. Watching this movie was like watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie with a touch of Spielberg's elements, except this trilogy will go down as a classic trilogy. This may seem like a typical 80's movie from the surface, but it has a lot of elements that makes it brilliant. It's difficult to describe in words, but this movie, this trilogy just works and will stick with you. When it comes to the story it's actually very simple, but sometimes the simple aspect of a film makes it more worthwhile sometimes even if it deals with time travel. Watching this even now I can understand why a movie like this can be a timeless classic and give kids a colorful imaginative ideas. I for one tried to build a time machine with my brother when we were younger after watching this movie and had a blast! 9/10",Back to the Future
47,OllieSuave-007,Pure fun and entertaining time travel movie!,10,4 September 2015,"One of the most iconic movies in cinematic history, where, in 1985, young Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels back to 1955 in a time machine (named the DeLorean) invented by his scientist friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). In meets his high-school-age parents and inadvertently disrupts their first meeting; therefore, he must unite them in order to save their eventual courtship and marriage, and ultimately, Marty's own existence.Despite being an '80s film, the special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean.The direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film engaging throughout, from Marty traveling back in time to save Emmett Brown to him meeting his future family. Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the past with Marty trying to patch things up in the past for a better future outcome are things that make time travel films brilliant. I also especially liked the dialog from the 1955 time-line, ""He's teasing you, nobody has two television sets!"" Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. They all made the film fun and entertaining. As a time travel film, this plot really has a race against time element that makes this movie that much more exciting and an edge-of-your-seat experience. A must-see for sci-fi fans! Grade A",Back to the Future
48,thesar-2,Go 'Back' to the Magic,10,3 July 2009,"What teenage boy didn't want to be Marty McFly (Fox) if they grew up in the 80s? I certainly did. He had it all: someone he loved and loved him back, a best friend that could literally send him on adventures, played guitar in a band, a carefree spirit – using vehicles to accelerate his skateboarding, including a cop's and to be able to time-travel – catching his parents in future lies. I grew up on 'Back to the Future'; I must've watched it 50 times as a kid, never knowing I was taking for granted how much this comedic adventure masterpiece was completely unique and rarely a movie such as this comes around. Watching this now, having watched 1000s of movies since its release 24 years ago, I appreciate it all the more. The movie has great, pitch-perfect lines/comedy, extreme adventure, a heart, still well-made special effects and it certainly reminded me of how great movies used to be made: pre-CGI. Nothing against CGI, a lot of movies today benefit from the effect, but you have to appreciate the 50s town they recreated to scale, making me believe I was there. Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955 by his best friend (played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd) Doc Brown and after a few scenes to convince him he's really back in time, he seeks the aid of Brown to get, well, ""back to the future."" At the same time, its damage-control with the paradox he creates that almost erases his own existence. Sure, it had minor flaws: Fox definitively didn't look like a teenager in the sequels –he barely pulls it off here and of course there's the typical 80s numerous product placements, down to the DeLorean itself – ironically, not enough to save the doomed car. Still, an absolute must-see.",Back to the Future
49,cherold,wildly entertaining and beautifully constructed,8,12 December 2011,"I haven't seen this movie in 27 years. I decided to watch it again after playing Back to the Future: The Game, which made me nostalgic.As I remembered, it's a funny, entertaining, ingenious movie that never flags. But what I could appreciate now, since even after 27 years I remembered the story remarkably well, was how nicely constructed the movie was. Nothing in it feels like a coincidence, or like a stretch. Everything is put in place. Everything Marty needs is there, but there's a good reason. Every crazy event follows a logical chain of circumstances. The movie is not simply wonderfully filmed but wonderfully designed, an example of a movie where everything has been thought out and nothing fudged. Sure, the story has the sort of time travel conundrums that make all time travel movies susceptible to criticism for being ultimately impossible, but if you accept the basic sci-fi premises, everything else makes perfect sense.If you've never seen it, watch it just for the entertainment. If you've seen it before, watch it again just to notice how nicely put together it is.",Back to the Future

51,Robert_duder,The BIG 400TH REVIEW...Back To The Future is a top ten in my books!!,10,4 August 2006,"Here I am...wow...like it amazes me every time. This is my 400th review on IMDb. Three years or more, 400 films, some good, some REEEALLY bad and I hope everyone enjoys my reviews because I enjoy writing them and I don't plan on stopping. So for each 100 films I have reviews a Superman film being such a huge fan but for 400 I decided on something special...this film easily hits my top ten of all time favorites list so without further adieu...Back To The Future.Did they know they were making something this incredible when they were making it?? I think perhaps they did, that is part of the magic because Director and creator Robert Zemeckis holds nothing back from this flat out eighties classic fantasy adventure. The film is just so incredibly unique taking a cool, completely hip stereo typical eighties teenager and tossing him back into the mid fifties experience and forcing him to save his own existence by making sure his mother and father hook up. The special effects, the utter intense detail that goes into this amazing story line that makes sure everything flows properly, and captures not only 1985 vividly, but 1955 vividly. Zemeckie creates Hill Valley California from scratch and makes it feel like everyone's home town and he makes sure that we see every aspect of it so we can be as stunned and blown away by 1955 Hill Valley just like Marty McFly. This film is just brilliant.Marty McFly, a classic character in the history of film is played by the irrepressible Michael J. Fox in his hey day. Fox (although 24 at the time) was perfect as the 17 year old kid that everybody wanted to be, and everybody wanted to be his friend and for the course of the film you felt like you were right there along with him. This is without a doubt Fox's best role and he has had some good ones but this one takes the cake. He is so smooth and a fast talking, material driven, eighties kid and he's perfect. How can we forget Dr. Emmett Brown?? We can't!! Christopher Lloyd plays the most eccentric and yet brilliant Scientist inventor of the eighties. Doc, as he is known to Marty, is brilliant but almost to the point of insanity. It shows in his personality, his actions and his creations. His I.Q. is obviously off the charts. Despite the age different Doc Brown and Marty have this incredible friendship and Fox and Lloyd's chemistry reflect this strong bond between them. No one could have expected these two would be such a great pairing but they are!! Lea Thompson plays Marty's mother Lorraine Baines McFly. She spends more time playing the bubbly, rebellious teenage Lorraine and she's terrificly believable as both that role and as Marty's mother. Crispin Glover plays whiny, rather weak George McFly, Marty's father. Now I'm not a big fan of Glover and his personal decisions (such as suing the producers of the sequels to this film) had not made me like him any more but he truly created a unique and terrific anti hero in George Mcfly. I will forever associate Back To The Future with the nerdy annoying laugh and his petrified nerdy walk. Thomas F. Wilson is the bully that everyone wanted to see get his in the end Biff Tannen. Wilson is just terrific as a guy that you absolutely despise and yet he still strikes that feeling of dread when he shows up...he's the perfect bully and adversary to Marty AND his father in 1955. They share the same enemy. The cast mesh so well together and the transformations of thirty years between everyone in the cast with the exception of Michael J. Fox is really astounding. I mean sometimes the make up looks a little cheesy but it's really quite amazing to see them. You really feel like you're traveling in time.And isn't that what makes Back To The Future one of the most incredible adventures of all time. You're right there with Marty 100% of the time and you feel like you're going through everything that he is. The story is brilliant and in such a complex film about time travel there is BOUND to be plot holes but Zemeckis does an incredible job and barely making you notice them and wrapping things up so carefully and creating this incredible world around the characters. Back To The Future is not something someone might see, it's something every single person should see because it IS a classic film and always will be. To this day (20 years after the fact) Back To The Future holds up as well now as it did then against ANY big budget special effects film nowadays. It was years ahead of it's time making it the absolute must see. The movie has a kick ass soundtrack featuring a lot of Huey Lewis and The News tracks that became associated with this film (Power of Love--for instance), and it's the absolute quintessential eighties film...the power of wanting material things (Marty's truck, George McFly's book) social status based on appearance...that's the eighties way!! Throw in some what was then ""cool"" four letter words (not a lot but enough to make it feel naughty to the youngsters) and you got yourself everything that Back To The Future is. An incredible film that I have probably seen a hundred times and love it equally as much every single time. 10/10 THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEWS...100 MORE TO GO TILL 500!!",Back to the Future
52,Lejink,The future's so bright,9,1 November 2015,"I suppose like many people I got caught up in the whole ""it was 30 years ago today"" shtick surrounding this movie of late and with a free Saturday afternoon indoors, with my wife watched this movie neither of us had seen since 1985. Thankfully, we both found it was just as much fun and exciting to see as all those years ago. I mean I'm an absolute sucker for any kind of time-travel stuff, especially the whole circular time, going-back-to-your-own-past-changing-your-own-future thing. I love how the film sometimes subtly, sometimes obviously sets up the prompts for future resolution, by so often doubling back on itself, but of course never lets all that timey-wimey stuff get in the way of what is at heart a rollicking, exciting, family entertainment.It helps that the casting is so good, Michael J Fox as the spirited, energetic teenager Marty McFly and the great Christopher Lloyd as the madcap scientist Doc Brown in the two lead roles but also the characters of Marty's gormless mum and dad and numb-skull bully Biff. The period-settings are lovingly and nostalgically rendered and the humour is sharp and relevant, as Marty straightens out the future lives of his whole family, actually saves the lives of his brother, sister and Doc while inventing rock and roll in the process!This really is a timeless entertainment and what better adjective could I use to describe it than that.",Back to the Future
53,ElMaruecan82,Back to the 50's ... Back to the 80's ... Back to a Timeless Classic ...,10,3 October 2011,"With a gentleness delicately lying beneath a smart and intelligent script, contributing to this extraordinary appeal that transcends every age barriers, ""Back to the Future"", in the same vein than its glorious predecessor ""It's a Wonderful Life"", is one of these heart-warming masterpieces that definitely stood the test  of time.There is Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's improbably pairing as Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown, the cool 80's teenager and the mad scientist, yet the chemistry is here, and we believe that these guys can be great friends. There is this unforgettable sight of the De Lorean at 88 mph disintegrating in a flash of light, leaving the two unforgettable fire trails. There is this heart-pounding climax on the clock tower driven by Alan Silvestri exhilarating 80's-defining score. There is this heart in the story. As the pillar of the movie's greatness there is Bob Gale and Zemeckis' winner script.""Back to the Future"" deserves its reputation as one of the most quotable films ever and with the richest gallery of colorful characters each one impacting our memories with so many delirious catchphrases, from Biff Tannen's ""Butthead"" to Marty's ""This is heavy"" and of course, Doc's hysterical ""1,21 Gigawatts!"" or ""Great Scott"". Christopher Lloyd has this unique talent to revive the mad scientist figure with a likable dimension, creating one of the most eccentric and sympathetic characters from the flamboyant 80's. But the power of the script doesn't just rely on its 'destiny' in one-liners, but in the way it rigorously respects the codes of every genre with a new remarkable technical precision.""Back to the Future"" is a masterstroke of originality in the way it adapted the 'adventure' genre, where the exoticness of the setting doesn't rely on its geographical but chronological aspect. Marty lives in a weird world where people don't know what a Pepsi Free or who John Kennedy are, and where Ronald Reagan is still ""the actor?!"". The adventure aspect provides some of the best gags of the film. Now to the Sci-Fi, from the simple premise of the film: time travels, Zemeckis refreshed an old scientific speculation by introducing the notion of ripple effect, that the smallest change in the past can have significant consequences for the future, for the better or for the worse. Finally, a movie had the right approach to time travels, probably earning it a deserving place in AFI's Top 10 Sci-Fi films.This scientific approach conditioned Marty's mission in 1955, by preventing his parents from meeting and falling in love, Marty unknowingly jeopardized his own existence and of his siblings. The script outsmarts us through its ability to convert one thousands words into one simple image, Marty's picture with his brother and sister and the progressive fading of their bodies, cleverly illustrates Doc's notion of ripple effect. No need of words, the picture is the materialization of the success or the failure of the mission. And as long as Lorraine (Lea Thompson), is in love with her future son, the existence of her future children with George is severely compromised.What a tricky dilemma! And when you discover Marty's family in 1985, you wonder how such a loser as George McFly (Crispin Glover) could have had a woman anyways. And Marty made the thing impossible again by replacing his own father on his to-be mother's heart. And Lorraine, by falling in love with her own son, creates a whole oedipal situation that, beyond the laughs, offers a very interesting perspective on the perception we might have toward our parent's youth, as we finally realize that they were young once. Of course, no one would dare to question how he would react if his own mother fell in love with him, but the way this is handled in the film is tactful and never fall into caricature.This is the very aspect that makes ""Back to the Future"" a Family Comedy, with a heart beating for every generation, a film you can enjoy with your parents your buddies or your kids whether it's from the 50's or the 80's nostalgic value. Most of the film's humor relies on the 'generation gap' factor and the way things have changed a lot or not so much. Compare Lorraine's advice to her kids in 1985 and the way she behaved thirty year earlier. See poor Uncle Joey who might get used to his bars as a baby, Biff Tannen's same stupid jokes etc. The film cleverly underlines the effect time can have on our perceptions and relationships with people. But the beauty of ""Back to the Future"" is that the heart of the Family story and the entertainment from the laughs combined with the speculative imagination of Sci-Fi contribute to a new inspirational dimension.Time travels represent the final opportunity to domesticate time, and to get a second chance. George gets a second chance and Marty learns one lesson or two during his journey while applying the fatherly advice he gave to his own father. And even more powerful is the way George would ultimately be the one to win Lorraine's heart and not through Marty's intervention, proving that sometimes, a simple act of bravura can change all your life for the best. Similarly to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", the film is about getting a second chance, about life, about time passing  And I can't go on without mentioning the most extraordinary moment of the film that would eternally ring bells of joy in my heart when George finally kisses Lorraine and in all of sudden, Marty who was progressively fading gets up and sees his brother and sister finally reappear in the photo. Mission accomplished! And two young people dancing, ignoring, but we do, that they'll be forever together. An extraordinary moment that for me, summarizes the cherished place this film will occupy in my heart, for a long ... time.",Back to the Future
54,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A timeless classic.,10,5 April 2020,"'Back To The Future (1985)' might just be my favourite film of all time. It's an absolute classic, endlessly rewatchable and utterly brilliant. Its story really is timeless, less focused upon its sci-fi concept than you might expect. Even though the past is recreated with a lavish contrast, the piece doesn't tend to revel in its part period setting. Instead, it keeps its focus firmly on its characters and the dilemma in which they find themselves. Marty and Doc are as iconic a pairing as there's ever been, each written to perfection and performed just as well. Fox is fittingly flustered, as relatable as you can get, and Lloyd is like a living cartoon, lighting up the screen whenever he appears. The rest of the cast are all great, too; almost everyone has a distinct and memorable personality. After a lengthy but necessary set up, the flick absolutely flies by. Its amazing finale is comprised of a series of satisfying climaxes; everything pays off in some major way. The affair is incredibly efficient in that regard, as it only shows things that are vital to the story. It squeezes as much tension from its set-pieces as possible - I mean, I still squirm with suspense during its clock-tower clambering sequence even after a dozen viewings. The movie is phenomenally well-made in general. Frankly, it's a masterpiece. It puts a big, beaming smile on my face and keeps it there right through to the end of its credits. If I had a time-machine, I'd go back to 1985 to watch this in the cinema. 10/10",Back to the Future
55,bowmanblue,As good as it ever was,10,26 December 2017,"There are some films that are just timeless and everyone should watch (especially in today's climate of remakes, reboots and reimaginings). Basically, see it before it gets horribly remade with overblown computer effects and wafer-thin characters that you simply just don't care about. By now, you can probably already tell that I love this film and I'm effectively going to 'gush' about it, so if you just want to accept now that it's a definite 10/10 you might as well stop reading now. However, if you're vaguely interested as to why I think it's so - technically - perfect, then feel free to read on. In case you're one of the few people that have been living in 1955 all your life and have only just arrived in our year courtesy of a time machine, you may need to know that 'Back to the Future' is about time travelling. Marty McFly, played by the ever youthful Michael J Fox, gets caught up in eccentric inventor, Doc Brown's, latest scheme to build a time machine out of a DeLorean car. Naturally, things don't go smoothly as he inadvertently ends up in 1955 and accidentally interferes with the very moment his parents got together, therefore possibly preventing him from every being conceived. If this wasn't bad enough, he's only got a one-shot chance at returning to his own time thanks to a lightning bolt due to power his time machine for the return trip.I think what makes this film stand the tests of time is the fact that it is a true 'family' film. Whereas most films which can be watched by children are largely aimed ONLY at them and force the adults to sit through it until it's over, I can't imagine anyone - male/female, young/old - not actually finding enjoyment out of this adventure. It's funny without ever being childish or vulgar, exciting without ever being over the top or unrealistic (if you're willing to suspend your disbelief enough to believe that time travel is actually possible) and, of course, it contains some of the most memorable characters ever committed to film. Naturally, our dashing young hero, Marty, is very easy to root for, however it's his cranky old sidekick 'Doc', played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd who steals every scene and is the true joy to watch all the way through. It's also worth mentioning that Marty's on-screen family also can hold their own, played different versions of themselves throughout the time periods, but special mention should go a character who should - by rights - be little more than a stereotypical bully, yet 'Biff' somehow becomes the clichéd bully that all other on-screen thugs aspire to be ever after. If this film has a downside - and I'm only mentioning this because I can see that some people may have a problem with it these days (I didn't and still don't!) it's that there are a few topics of humour that some people may find a little 'edgy' in today's PC culture. For some reason I get the feeling that today any 'family' movie may shy away from a mother inadvertently falling in love with her son, but it was the eighties and things were different then!There aren't many movies that still can bring a family together around the TV in the living room on Christmas Day, but this is still one of them. If you haven't already brought the entire trilogy on DVD, then watch it now and show your children. It deserves to entertain future generations. Yes, the following two 'Back to the Future' movies weren't quite so well-received by the critics, but I think they're great, too.",Back to the Future

Everything is just about perfect with this film considering it came out in the mid-80's. The story is about a guy named Marty and his professor friend Dr. Brown. Brown invents a time machine in a car and Marty uses the car to travel to 1955 after a tragedy happens. While in 1955 and after messing up the way his parents met, he must fix this problem to avert another tragedy. The acting and directing in this film is great. The story is funny and some lines made me laugh like a hyena. The music makes the movie sound like a true 80's movie. ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis is an instant classic! Overall, this a movie classic for the ages. I rate this film a 10/10.",Back to the Future

58,lesleyharris30,"A Brilliant Story that will Entertain for Years to come,",10,7 January 2013,"Back to the Future is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. I never grow tired of this film, I know the story inside and out now and I still happily watch it every time, laughing at the same parts, watching at the edge of my seat with others, it never gets old for me, it's a pure eighties classic, and one of the few movies that all generations tend to enjoy. The cast is fantastic and one of the most vital parts of making this movie work, they didn't seem like easy characters, particularly Marty and Doc, they have a lot of layers and certain requirements for portraying them accurately, but every actor nails their role, the script has some very funny bits, but also dramatic parts, and the cast succeeds in all areas of acting. The story is quite complicated, it has the concept of time travel involved, thrown in with a complicated love story, as well as a lot of necessary character development, but it manages to perfectly bring all of this together in a movie that isn't even two hours long, and it dosen't manage to feel any bit cluttered or overlong. Memorable lines, historical movie moments, outstanding performances, a beautiful script and stellar directing from the great Robert Zemeckis, I consider Back to the Future to be my favourite movie, I think all moviegoers should see it, it's a must watch. After ending up in the year 1955 through his friend Doctor Emmet Brown's time machine, Marty McFly must make sure his parents get together to ensure his existence after ruining the moment they fell in love.

59,CuriosityKilledShawn,"Take me away, I don't mind",9,29 January 2016,"Now more than 30 years after its release it's virtually impossible to review BTTF and say something that is new. Almost all observations of the film have already been made and the chance that my review will seem stale and familiar has put me off for years, but now is the time to finally get it done.Since there are as-of-yet undiscovered tribes in the heart of the Amazon jungle who already know the plot of Back to the Future I will forgo typing out a synopsis. Time travel is a tricky device when plotting movies. It can work in your favor or it can destroy you. Both the Terminator and Star Trek have suffered under the paradoxical strain of time travel. I suppose the main lure of the concept is the chance to go back and live key moments in your life and do them differently, putting right what once went wrong - the lifetime pursuit of Doctor Samuel Beckett.Back to the Future is a pop culture giant for many reasons. The iconic poster art, the fire trails, the instantly recognizable DeLorean, the title font, the costume design, the locations, Alan Silvestri's thrilling score, Huey Lewis' emblematic theme tune, but mainly for the dual time period. 1985 was present day when it was released but as I type this review it is 31 years in the past. In 1985 the western world still had a naive innocence, a hope that the future could be bright. Culture was hedonistic, optimistic, willing to experiment. In the three decades since then we have become bitter, pessimistic, and cynical. Dystopia, dysfunction, and distrust has permeated the majority of households. We are no longer a society that plans for the future, only to struggle through the day-by-day grind of increasingly hopeless existence. We long for the glory days of 1985 and Back to the Future allows us to access that dream.But there was an even more naive and innocent time, a world that Marty McFly finds himself trapped in with only a chance lightning strike to send him back home. 1955 Hill Valley (or Kingston Falls if you look at it from a Gremlins perspective) is a post-WWII Utopian Americana where the streets are clean, the world is safe, and the lifestyles are wholesome. It's a rose-tinted insight into forever gone era. Society has grown darker and darker over the decades. We all wish we had a nuclear-powered time machine to stop this ever-declining spiral and skew the timeline into an alternate present.Back to the Future is a good movie, a great movie, a perfectly cast and acted movie, an all time best and a classic for all the right reasons, but its main appeal is that it makes the viewer think ""what if I had that chance?"" I think most people would sacrifice their comfortable familiarity of their known present to go back in time and radically change the future for the better, and what better style to do that in than a DeLorean?This movie will never age. It's an icon of its era and a movie that defines an entire decade. It will stand the test of time (pun intended) and will appeal to each new generation for all of the above reasons. That's just the power of love, man.",Back to the Future

If there are some who have not seen it, at least they have heard of it, and references from the film have long been implemented in pop culture. Fast-paced, fun, witty, with top effects for its time, a multi-layered story that stimulates thinking and awakens the imagination, and accompanied by great music, this film aged well and is as impressive today as it was at the time of its creation.

62,ironhorse_iv,Great Scott! Back to the Future is a great time-travel movie!,9,21 July 2014,"Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While, he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish out of water history time-travel comedy, with the high-stakes action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckis's work, and what was happening in the 1980s at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risqué and adult-aimed at the time; this movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settlings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the Oedipal relationship with his mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love from this film. Mad praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost call, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back into the title, 'Back to the Future'. Another is that, while, Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Eric Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Michael J Fox was the best choice for the film and they wait on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine McFly. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him. The set use for the film is one of the most famous movie backlot, previously being used in such works as 1962's To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1960's Inherit the Wind, and others works. The movie had a pretty good pace. There weren't a lot of slow or boring moments. Maybe, the beginning, it does take them, forever to get the time travel part of the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth and Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Thank God, they cut the 'Nuking the Fridge' idea. An early draft of the Back to the Future script saw Marty travelling through time in a fridge and being caught in a nuclear bomb detonation. Spielberg would later use this in 2008's Indiana Jones & Kingdom Skull. Zemeckis almost cut out the ""Johnny B. Goode"" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. The visual/special effects are just ground-breaking for the time, and it's just beautiful to watch. The opening scene, flawlessly sets up the film's central themes of time and space, provides heaps of exposition. The music by Alan Silvestri is emotional, epic and intense music. It's give the feel of two friends alone, fighting alone against two of the greatest forces ever know to humanity; time and fate. About Huey Lewis and the News, ""The Power of Love"". It's a product of its time. It doesn't hurt or help the film. It's just there. I do love the 'Earth Angel' song. It's romantic as hell. There are some nitpicks that I could focus on, like the time-travel plot-holes, but trying to understand the logic of all the time travel paradoxes, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Still, how his parents never find out that Marty McFly look like the kid, Calvin Klein from their childhood? Other faults of the movie are, the Pepsi product placement and its over used clichés. The movie also one of those films that would audience would see anything in it, as people see symbolism from 9/11 tragedy, JFK assassination conspiracy, Aliens, and others. Others see the film, themes taken from ancient and spiritual myths such as Kronos vs Zeus, the Bible, and others. One thing, it did influence is the skateboarding culture. The movie occurred during the 1980s infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture. The film was such a success, that it create two sequels, 1989's 'Back to the Future Parts II' and 1990's 'Back to the Future Park III'. It also create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. As with all great movies, Back to the Future, has stood the test of time. It never gets old.

The plot is silly and full of holes, but it is fun to watch. Most of the characters are stereotypes that seem to have stepped out of sitcoms. Fox became a star with this film and Thompson is good as his mother. This was an early success for the talented Zemeckis, who keeps the action moving at a fast clip. The scenes leading to the trip back to the future are very exiting and well executed. This film was a huge success and was followed by a couple of sequels.",Back to the Future
64,The-Sarkologist,A Childhood Classic,9,24 June 2018,"Seriously, I haven't written a review on this film. Well I better watch it again and rectify that. I love this film, it is literally a classic from the Eighties. In fact not only is it a classic from the Eighties, and takes me back to my childhood, but it also takes our parents back to their childhood by going back in time to 1955. Okay, this film does have the potential to mess with your head, but it is still great.
 I'm not sure if I even need to run through the synopsis since I assume that everybody actually knows the plot, but then again I'm sure there are people that have basically been living in a rabbit hole who may not know anything about this film. Basically, it is about a teenage kid, Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox) who watches his friend the Mad Scientist Doc Brown get killed by Libyan terrorists (namely because they gave him some plutonium to build a bomb and instead he uses it to power the time machine) and to escape them Marty jumps into the DeLorean and inadvertently goes back in time to 1955.
 Well, you have to admit that that DeLorean is just so cool. In fact, this film is so much apart of our collective consciousness that I actually wonder whether anybody can look at a DeLorean and think of a time machine. Actually, I wonder if anybody actually went out and purchased a DeLorean with the hope that if they drove up to 88 mph they would end up going back in time? Then again, I suspect that there are some authorities that may have had a thing or two so say about that.
 Actually, there are a couple of things that baffle me, including the fact that when Marty got back to 1985 he pretty much leaves the DeLorean unlocked and parked in the middle of the road. I'm sure that there would have been people who may have wanted to take a free DeLorean with them. Then again, if it wasn't running at the time then it probably isn't much of an issue. However, at least he was smart enough to hide the DeLorean behind some bushes when he was in 1955, though there is always the suggestion that things were a lot safer, and crime a lot less back them.
 However, Hill Valley in 1985 really didn't seem to be one of those places that would be all that fun to live in. You know, the town square looks pretty shocking, and it is interesting that the old cinema has been turned into a church. Then again, a lot of churches meet in cinemas - it sort of works rather well, and the sound is also pretty good, or at least the wiring. However, I also noticed that the place next door was an adults only entertainment complex - right next to a church. Gee, I'm sure the church is happy about that.
 This is basically one of those lets go back in time and change everything, inadvertently of course, so that the rather dreary life back home actually becomes quite good, even if it really came down to a single punch. Then again, Biff Tanner really did have it coming to him, and it clearly goes to show that the guy is all talk and no action. Well not quite, but it is quite convenient that they moved all of his thugs away just as George McFly inadvertently came up to the car, expecting Marty to be in there. Of course, punching Biff really does a lot to George's self esteem.
 Oh, and then there is the principle, going around calling everybody slackers. I'm sure there is a law against that. Oh, that's right, it's 1985 and teachers could get away with demonising students. Then again, what did George do wrong? Why had he earnt the enmity of the headmaster? This guy certainly seems to have it in for him, or was it that he pretty much had it in for all of his students. Surely he knew what Biff was like anyway. Actually, the interesting thing is how the guy never actually seems to age. Okay, Marty does comment on the fact that he has never had any hair, but still, we can't quite fault the movie for having the principle look the same. However what was it, thirty years in the same job. That's literally his entire career.
 Oh, and there is another thing that I find somewhat curious. If Doc Brown is now aware that he sends Marty back in time, where does Marty go when he flees the Libyan terrorists. Honestly, I wonder if Doc Brown actually realises that the time line has already been changed with Marty going back the first time, so if Marty goes back a second time, it isn't as if he is going to keep the timeline consistent. In fact the second Marty who goes back is likely to make some more changes, and inevitably he is going to muck up the time line even more. As I come to think of it, it seems as if Doc Brown doesn't fully understand the fifth dimension, so most likely he will set the timer to the exact time that Marty comes back, which will mean that there will be two DeLoreans arriving at the same time, and Marty will meet, well, Marty.
 Anyway, this is a great movie, and it certainly brings back a lot of childhood memories. Actually, I have no idea how many times I have watched this, though I will have to say that the guy that walks around wearing 3D glasses looks pretty cool, even if he happens to be one of Biff's thugs. Then again, they do eventually get whats coming for them when they end up picking on the wrong people.",Back to the Future

Usually in the first 20 minutes a movies often decide its fate and I'm thinking of a witty title for IMDb.I've only ejected 1 movie as it played in my life time, walked out of plenty, on my phone as movie is playing, day dreamed to a few movies like Avatar, fell asleep to movies like The Dark Knight and Wonder Woman.BTTF Beginnings almost made me day dream. I heard so much hype, expectations were high; and the start just felt kind of lame.As Soon as he went back in to the past that's when the movie had my attention. By the end of the movie when he returned home I was glaring at the screen. That never happens to me.Usually when I watch movies I'm multi-tasking on my phone.

He meets a couple hurdles and almost makes out with his teen mom. Not sure if that counts as incest.Anyways.

70,zkonedog,My Favorite Film of All-Time,10,12 March 2017,"When you browse a catalog of films (online or otherwise), the titles are usually arranged according to genre, such as drama, action, comedy, romance, etc. When it comes to Back To The Future, a copy would need to be put in almost every category, as it is perhaps the only film I have ever seen that almost completely defies the very notion of genre. That reason, among others, is why I consider this to be the finest film ever made.The basic story revolves around 1980s teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whose friendship with mad scientist ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) ends up with Marty in a time machine--made out of a Delorean!--whisked away to the year 1955, where he ""messes with the space-time continuum"" and must make sure that his parents meet and fall in love once again, thus assuring his own existence.That relatively simple concept contains so, so much more in terms of overall entertainment. It is hilarious, romantic, dramatic, and full of action and adventure in equal measure. The acting is also some of the best that cinema has to offer. While Fox and Lloyd are now iconic as the leads, the trio of Lea Thompson (playing Lorraine Baines), Crispin Glover (George McFly), and Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen) almost steal the show on certain occasions with their various personalities. Even the ""bit players"" are superb in their short, yet very important/meaningful appearances.Perhaps the most impressive thing about this entire film experience, though, is the detail put into each and every scene. One must pay close attention to every single detail (no matter how small or seemingly inane) of every single scene in the 1980s-portion of the film in order to better understand the jokes and sight gags of the 1950s-era time frame. I have watched this film at least a dozen or more times all the way through, yet on each viewing I find something new that I seemed to have missed.Finally, the screenplay from ""the Bob's"" (Zemeckis & Gale) is perfect. I say that without hyperbole. There is simply not a wasted line or scene in the entire picture. Everything has meaning in some way, shape, or form that is paid off further down the road.Whenever I watch ""Back To The Future"", its roughly 2-hour runtime seems to absolutely fly by. It is so perfectly paced, with each scene expertly transitioning into the next, that there's never an iota of chance you'll be taken out of the experience in any way. It is the very best that cinema has to offer on all fronts.",Back to the Future
71,johnnyboyz,"Still a fantastic example of comedy, horror and general fantastic family entertainment incorporating and promoting self-belief and courage.",8,2 April 2009,"The opening shots of Back to the Future set up the film's ideas and general tone. We are treated to several inventions and gadgets and gizmos, within someone's kitchen and living area, designed to seamlessly ease into one another as the beginnings to a day are kick started. Maybe a television will come on; a robotic arm will pour dog foot into an already over stuffed bowl and toast will pop up when ready, but very burnt. The idea here is that this stuff can work, but to what negative effect? It's quite clear this area hasn't been occupied for a while and the dog food will surely leave a foul smell for when the owner returns but what's that compared to the fire hazards in both the TV and the toast? This is what the film will eventually branch out into; a piece about technology and inventions working but with what, potentially quite terrible, results.Back to the Future is one of those rare and special films that feel tilted more toward a younger audience and yet bear no harm in being revisited by others later on in years. The film can amuse and is able to sustain humour and interest, no matter how wacky the characters are or the predicament is. The film can frighten and additionally pay sly homage to history whilst it includes a fair few gags to how the protagonist's actions perhaps changed the course of history as we know, those being more directed toward the adult watching audience with Marty McFly's rendition of 'Johnny B. Goode' a great example. The film is a near masterpiece, bordering on greatness as it seamlessly entertains, humours, delivers a brilliant and inventive narrative whilst even feeling brave enough to touch on elements of a Freudian nature.Of Marty McFly, he is played by Michael J. Fox in what is a big-screen career defining role. The piece of brilliant technology that is used to a certain degree of negative effect is the time machine a certain Doctor Emmett Brown (Lloyd) built out of a DeLorean automobile. The film revolves around Marty using this invention to travel back to 1955, following an escape from some hostiles out for Emmett, and a consequential accidental changing of history equating in the danger of Marty himself quite possibly being scrubbed out of history.As a stand alone film, Back to the Future offers pretty perfect family entertainment. Its balance of fun and games mixed with a foreboding scenario, a scenario that lies at its very heart, is perfectly captured when McFly wanders down the Hill Valley street in 1955 following going back and witnessing how different his town was thirty years ago before the reality of the situation hits him in ominous fashion. Buried deep within Back to the Future might well be a statement on the condition of then contemporary America. Its two worlds of 1955 and 1985 exhibit the same facilities and general look, but offer very different outlooks on ways of living in the respective years. While porno theatres exist in the 80s, cinemas were playing the cream of Classical Hollywood back in the day; while shops and business' look shoddy, run down and some are even out of business in the modern age but they were clean and bristling with activity in the past.The film even pokes fun at mayoral promises, promising a bright outlook in the 1950s but we, as does the film's lead, know the truth of what becomes of the town. Without obviously pointing fingers, the film shares a joke with us to do with how remarkable it is that Ronald Reagan is the 1985 president. It enjoys telling us that Marty's home estate-to-be will be one of the 'best places to live' come development, but the harsh reality of it is that it's anything but. This is something the second film touches on more when the quality of living deteriorates even more when a powerful political figure (that would be this film's antagonist Biff) has a say in how the town is run, echoing Marty and Emmett's brief but poignant conversation to do with how unbelievable Emmett finds it that Ronald Reagen is the president in 1985.But while the film's political slant isn't its primary focus, you can't help but feel the film is a reference to how the author is very fond of the 1950s or the past in particular, something he sees to have been so much better than the present day. Marty's accidentally and ill advised attempts at changing history result in his teenage mother potentially falling in love with him, subject matter deemed too taboo for Disney and they rejected the film, but the ideas aren't played for sick laughs and the film doesn't linger on the actual notion as much as it does focus on Marty's reactions to all these realisations his would-be mother is having towards him. The 'park' scene in particular acts as an example as to how Marty feels about the situation with the overly dramatic facial expressions acting as an offbeat and drastic reaction to the predicament. It's additionally easy to forget that, by the end, his mother's attention turns more towards George, like history should be, highlighting what a vulnerable girl she is and how easily it is for this girl to fall for someone else at such a delicate time in her life.This factor deflects the idea of the mother falling too deeply in love with her own would-be son somewhat, as we realise how naive she really is to fall again so quickly. But the film is full of ideas and energy, arguably being the best of its 'type' at the time of release. Producers didn't think people would take to it due to its lack of 'risqué' but years later, it stands head and shoulders above all the other 'more risqué' teen films that were released at that time.",Back to the Future

But after a few adventures, Marty becomes the first time traveler by accident and gets involved in the midst of her own parents' romance in the 1950s. Now she'll need all the help she can to make sure. back in 1985, that his parents are married and that he himself will exist in the future.The film cleverly blends sci fi and comedy. Robert Zemeckis can make things work perfectly by designing a lightweight movie that can entertain and make you laugh, but still smart enough to appeal to the most demanding audiences. The film never tries to be credible or scientifically accurate, nor is it required as it is clearly a comedy. The cast, in turn, is absolutely dominated by the excellent partnership of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, with a series of memorable dialogues in between. Both actors here have probably achieved the most notable roles of their careers. The other actors contribute perfectly.Special effects, visuals and sound are inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie and here they work quite well. The soundtrack has also become iconic. In fact, the entire film has gained classic status, to the point that the film has been preserved as part of American cultural memory. For me personally, it is one of the most remarkable films of the eighties, which has aged very well and still has class, charm and style today.",Back to the Future
73,Petey-10,All time greatest,10,18 February 1999,"Back to the Future is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do a great acting job in it and so do all the other actors. Tom Wilson is great as Biff. All the parts of Back to the Future trilogy are great,and if they made BTTF4,I bet it would be great too. This movie is worth watching many times.",Back to the Future
74,leplatypus,Great Scott ! That's a heavy trilogy (dvd) (vhs),10,31 July 2013,"This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read ""IT"" by Stephen King or watch ""Twin Peaks"" by David Lynch for examplesThe next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom.The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !",Back to the Future
75,TheMovieDiorama,Back to the Future accelerates its time traveling nostalgic adventure to a whopping 88mph.,8,15 June 2019,"Great Scott! Finally managed to watch the quintessential 80s flick that combines a plethora of genres to generate an astounding 1.21 gigawatts. Enough to make me want to go back in time and watch it again. Damn. Damn damn! Now, it's no surprise that Zemeckis' most accessible film is the one that has stood the test of time. Spielberg matching him with this project was seemingly fate, and in the process they had created a pop culture phenomenon that contributed massively to many childhoods. A teenager, who documents a time travelling experiment with an eccentric scientist, accidentally travels back in time to which he must repair history and return to the correct year.With Zemeckis' overwhelming contribution and Gale's stellar writing, they had amalgamated an absurd amount of genres into one adventure. Primarily a romantic comedy with the aesthetics of a science-fiction adventure packed with arresting action set pieces. A whimsical invention that perfectly balanced a variety of tones, resulting in an instant classic. Embedding various intricacies within its script, from the clock tower donation fund to the flux capacitor revelation, that you subconsciously start to cling onto every line of dialogue. Every word is so important in its foreshadowing, that it progressively enhances the enjoyment of its story.It has to be said that the execution of some of these moments were heavy-handed (in case we missed anything...) and the paradoxical nature of its time travel premise was frequently brushed over. But the purposefully engaging characters and plot are able to distract us from these loopholes that sci-fi features commonly fall into. Although the final ten minutes wrapped up far too neatly for my taste, considering Doc went against his own words of advice.Speaking of good ol' Doc Brown, Lloyd's performance was the highlight for me. Capturing the eccentric personality of his character perfectly, from the exaggerated facial expressions to the excitable scientific mumbo-jumbo that he blurts out. He is just as memorable as the pimped out DeLorean. Fox, again, was perfect casting for Marty McFly, the flyest kid in town with his hardcore skateboarding skills hanging onto the back of vehicles. Comedic timing was exquisite and the more dramatic moments involving his past younger mother and father were well handled by him. Glover deserves some praise also, no longer will I class him as the ""creepy thin man"" from 'Charlie's Angels'. He is George McFly, author extraordinaire and my new personal hero for decimating Biff with one punch. Now, Biff for me was too one-dimensional to have a lasting impression, and became a forced plot device just so that the film had an antagonist of some sort. Personally, it didn't need one. Exclude him, or grant him some development time, and the story would've benefited from those alterations.It must be said that Silvestri's grand score accompanied the joyous onscreen shenanigans stupendously, and certainly had that Spielberg flair found in most Amblin productions despite the small scale drama. Oh, and ""The Power of Love"" is banging. All this time, and I didn't know it was associated with this film (I'm so uncultured...)!Suffice to say, regardless of the shortcomings and an absence of personal childhood nostalgia for the film, it still delivers strong entertainment today. Perfect casting, punctual dialogue and memorable scenes. It may not be the best 80s film I've seen, but it certainly has the gigawatts the maintain its lasting power for many years to come.",Back to the Future

Not only does it stand the test of time (no pun intended) but this family adventure just keeps getting better and better, My three sons grew up watching it with me and in the next few years into the future our first grandson will also be old enough to enjoy this treasure trove of a film.Michael J.

79,helpless_dancer,best time travel movie around,9,30 March 1999,Here is a very well done movie about time travel. It has it all. I especially liked the time machine itself - a Delorean car. The story was perfectly written with witty dialogue and never ending excitement. Each scene fit snugly into the one preceding and following it. Michael Fox carried this one all the way. 5 stars.,Back to the Future
80,digitalbeachbum,It was uber cool in 1985 but not so much in 2019,1,13 February 2019,"A kid/family movie which was good in 1985 but in 2019 it fails on many levels. The number of flaws and inconsistencies in the movie show how they rushed the production and didn't pay any attention to the details.Fox and Lloyd are a perfect match and the rest of the supporting staff are very good. I believe Fox is a better choice than Stoltz, but not that I think Stoltz is not a good actor. I believe Fox is just a better choice in relation to Lloyd. Stoltz is taller and thinner, more like Lloyd. Fox is short and stocky, providing a good contrast.I don't like time travel because writers use it as a deus ex machina to make stuff happen. It is abused by writers, as did the writers of Back to the Future, to make everything work. However their process of writing of the script this way creates too many new problems.For example, when Marty goes back in time, he meets Doc as the earlier version for the first time. He then goes back to the future. Then doc goes to the future and comes back to Marty in the present. They then go back to the past again, then back to the present, then back to the far past, then to the middle past.Eventually paths are crossing each other and characters seem to forget stuff that they should have already seen or know. The characters in the overlapping scenes do not react to seeing or knowing the same experience - EXCEPT - in Back to the Future Part 2 when Biff recalls seeing the ""flying Delorean"" Most of all, there are conflicts with Doc's memory and even Marty's parents.So if you can set aside all the science and logic, then this will be a good movie for you and the family. There is very minimal language, violence and sexual scenes. So it will be acceptable for the teens and depending on who you are, the younger children.Do I like it? Meh, it's OK. Not great and could have been better.",Back to the Future
81,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The greatness of 'Back to the Future' is both obvious and defies explanation,9,22 March 2017,"""Back to the Future"" is a quintessential '80s movie and '50s throwback that's fun for people of any and all ages, but it's also the first film to harness the concept of time travel in a universally human way.Time travel is both a critical and unessential part of the movie. Nearly everything that makes the movie fun and interesting comes from the time travel conceit, but the reason Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels into the past is accidental. Instead of traveling into the past to improve his life or fix a mistake – a much more obvious kind of wish fulfillment – Marty is inadvertently forced to save someone else's life, and ultimately preserve his own existence.Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale aren't necessarily searching for something profound with their screenplay, which is kind of what makes its deeply resonant and occasionally insightful moments so much more effective. The joy of watching the film is being entertained by the fun of it all and kind of incidentally uncovering the moments that move you or make you think with each viewing. Before you know it, you're biting your nails waiting for Marty to patch everything up in the space-time continuum and make it to the clock tower on time. Zemeckis' direction isn't particularly noteworthy, but he really works the emotional turning points of the script, maximizing the ""payoff moments"" for the audience.The cultural phenomenon of it all starts with Marty McFly. It's crazy to think that filming had been going on for weeks with Eric Stoltz playing Marty and only when that didn't work out did Fox get the part. He just exudes cool and in a timeless manner that allows ""Back to the Future"" to hold up more than 30 years later. He's tremendously likable, he rides a skateboard in an awesome way that we still haven't seen in the movies since, and he's brazen and defiant of authority in the way that most teenagers only dream of. Outcasts in the '50s couldn't stand up to bullies like Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) yet Marty does and becomes an instant hero in the eyes of anyone who's ever been bullied.The dynamic between Marty and the teenage version of his father, George (Crispin Glover) lies at the heart of the ""Back to the Future."" Although their relationship could definitely have been given more attention in the present day scenes, the fact that we know he's a man who gets completely walked over as an adult suffices. Really, it's George we identify with – the science-fiction nerd who struggles with rejection – and Marty represents the confident version of ourselves we so often strive to be. The wish fulfillment of the movie is about seeing the physical embodiment of that projection of ourselves (in Marty) making the weak George a stronger person.Marty's reactions with his younger mother (Lea Thompson) go the more comical, Oedipal route, but also there is this idea that our parents were teenagers too once, and they had their own struggles with contemporary living and authority. The fact that Marty has to help her and his father fall in love requires the kind of empathy we so rarely have for our parents as teenagers, and so much of the emotion of the film comes from watching that play out (not to mention the wish fulfillment of the popular Lorraine falling for the meek George).Then there's Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who is essentially the movie's mascot. He's thought of as a main character and everything builds toward saving him, but he's not all that integral to the human element of the story. He facilitates a lot of exposition, however, and it's his compassion toward Marty in the '50s timeline that endear us to him as much as it is his memorable lines, fabulous expressions and winks toward the camera. The iconography of the film really defies explanation. The DeLorean, Marty's outfit/skateboarding, the Huey Lewis soundtrack and, most importantly, Marty rocking out to ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, are so effortlessly perfect yet inessential components to the film's success. What this suggests is that the right combination of story and talent can infuse even the smallest details of a film with a paradigmatic energy that makes that detail feel classic or quintessential. In spite of stalling the plot, the ""Johnny B. Goode"" scene works because of the schism in time rooted in the time travel story. Marty's line ""your kids are gonna love it"" perfectly encapsulates that sentiment.In this way and others, ""Back to the Future"" defies most models of great filmmaking. It both captured the zeitgeist of its era (and of the '50s) while creating its own. Its footprint on culture is unmistakably large and its timelessness is both mystifying and yet ingeniously apropos.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Back to the Future

The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.
One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III.",Back to the Future
84,Vartiainen,Fantastic,10,4 November 2015,"I recently celebrated October 21, 2015 by re-watching the Back to the Future trilogy. And they were amazing. I had quite honestly forgotten just how good they were, just how funny, innovative, crazy, fast and quotable. And this is the one that started it all, and is easily the best film in the whole trilogy, which is saying a lot, keeping in mind the utter amount of quality all of them have.We all know the story. Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time machine, and wants his young friend Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to act as a witness for the first trial run. But things don't go as planned - do they ever - and Marty is flung back into the past where he has to figure out how he can get, you guessed it, back to the future. Great, amazing basic story, but what really makes this one of the most iconic time travel films ever made is the amount of detail they put into the world and the characters. The very first scene, for example, of Marty stepping into Doc's house looking for him is filled with vast amounts of little touches that all tell a story, both about Doc and Marty.And the movie just keeps going. All of the characters are very memorable and just the right amount of over the top and exaggerated. From Marty's ultimate wimp of a father George (Crispin Glover) to Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), who's such a massive Hollywood bully that it's a wonder he hasn't spontaneously combusted from sheer stereotypicality. But all that's part of the fun and the characters are played so well and the movie is so light in tone that their over the topness actually works for the film's advantage.The score by Alan Silvestri is also fantastic, one of the most iconic movie soundtracks in cinema history. Whenever the main theme blasts from the screen you're flung straight into an adventure. The special effects are also surprisingly decent. Sure there are some obvious computer effects, but they were very good for their time and luckily the film relies mostly on practical effects.Saying anything more would frankly spoil the movie too much. But trust me when I say that this is one of the finest adventure films ever made. It's cinema enjoyment distilled into its purest form. It's a sin I hadn't seen it in such a long time. A mistake which shall not be made again.",Back to the Future
85,taylorkingston,Such a fantastic movie...,10,27 September 2014,"I absolutely love this movie. It's one of my all time favorite movies. It' definitely in my top twenty. In this movie, we see Marty McFly and Doc, great friends, despite the age difference. Doc is a scientist, and Doc is just his nickname, given to him by Marty. His real name is Dr. Emmett Brown. And he has just made a successful time traveling machine. A DeLorean to be specific. That's right, he made a time machine out of a cool looking and futuristic car. But when Marty is accidentally sent back thirty years into the past, to 1955, lots of bad stuff happens. He meets his mother, who accidentally starts falling for her own son, without realizing it. And since he has altered the space/time continuum, he must get his parents to fall in love, otherwise, he's going to fade away. With the help of past Doc, he successfully gets his parents back together and gets home. And when he gets back to 1985, we find out that his life has been altered, for the better. I can't say enough how much I love this movie. It has such great cast including Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox, with a great plot and lots of little future jokes.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Back to the Future

Wells ""Time Machine"" ""BTTF"" is memorable all the way. Meeting your folks would be fun, but tampering with the past is not a game. Marty has to learn that hard. I liked the parts where he meets his father in the diner, and watch his future wife undress. Marty knew his father was a ""peeping tom"" when he was younger. Then trying to make a difference in their lives was the big part from keeping him and his siblings from non-existence was a bigger challenge. When everything was restored, Marty's finally changed for the better, though he introduced the skateboarding craze which one of the kids were amazed completely. Sticking to the dreams is important, listening to Dr. Brown is a must. Robert Zemeckis is a genius, and he really put up a solid cast and characters for the movie. The music rocks!

89,FiendishDramaturgy,Charming cult classic,8,22 January 2005,"This is one of the few cult classics which deserves its status. It is a fun popcorn movie which does not take itself too seriously. A teenager-oriented flick, as was the norm of the 1980's, which holds fond memories for many of that era.It's become trendy to point out all the discrepancies in the science of this sci-fi/comedy, but they do not matter one bit to the casual movie goer, who will plug in this flick with a bowl of popcorn and lean back in that recliner for an hour and a half of good, wholesome family fun. And, frankly, they don't matter to me, either. This is not one of those sci-fi movies which demands that the science be put into the story in order for it to work. This works beautifully for the ~lack~ of the science. There is nothing to muddle the pace, mess with the timing of the comedic delivery, nor throw off the dramatic sequences.It is a very satisfying ""coming of age"" movie.All in all this is a very enjoyable and entertaining film which rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Back to the Future
90,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: Michael J. Fox Superstar,8,5 February 2005,"Back to the Future (1985) was the film that launched Michael J. Fox's career into the stratosphere. This film not only made him into an eighties superstar but it also made Back to the Future a part of Americana and a slight fixture upon Hollywood for a few years there after. This film was so successful that it was made into a trilogy.The film follows a high school student Marty Mc Fly (Michael J. Fox) who's not pleased with the way his life has been going. He always feels that there's more to his life than what there appears to be. When he's not spending time with his girlfriend or his band, Marty is best friends with an eccentric inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc Brown is on the verge of breaking through his latest discovery. Marty watches his family and notice's how broken down they are. But when he see's that the family car is wrecked he loses it. There goes his date! This dilemma isn't nothing compared to what Doc Brown has in store for him!This film is the perfect example of an eighties film. The fashion and style is in your face. Crispin Glover (who plays the Marty father) steals the show with his neurotic style of acting. He portrays Marty with an underlining manic presence. Michael J. Fox makes a somewhat believable teenager and Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc Brown (another character who's a borderline basket case), Eighties stars Lea Thompson, Casey Simezsko, Courtney Gaines and future star Billy Zane appear in this one as well.I happen to enjoy this film. The sequel was entertaining as well. But the final chapter was a weak effort by all. If you like Michael J. Fox or Cripsin Glover I advise you to check this flick out.Recommended.",Back to the Future
91,hellraiser7,Race Against Time,10,5 August 2018,"This is another of one of my favorite films of all time. This film is special to me in so many ways, from the fact that it's another film from my childhood I saw this when I was about seven years old. But most importantly this was the very first time travel sci-fi I've ever seen and it's still my favorite in the sci-fi subgenera. Back then I never even heard of the genre and the concept, this film is one hell of an introductory, it was a concept that blew me away the ability to travel anywhere throughout time; personally, for me I'd love to revisit the 80's decade which is funny to say since this film was made in the 80's. You could also say this was the film that steered me to my favorite TV show of all time ""Doctor Who"".This film just has so much, I really like the story which is fun and clever at the same time. One thing this film does well is the fact things aren't overcomplicated, the fundamental problem with most time travel stories are sometimes they have this stupid need to complicate things or play around too much which really swiss cheeses the story in plot and consistence or that it's overly concerned on the concept and logic but little on story. This film keeps things simple because it keeps the car on the road, by keeping the focus on character and story. Sure, there is a slight complication and inconsistency in this story but it's not noticeable not even concerned about it, even I wasn't and let's face it all time travels stories have this. The film also kind of stays true to the pulp sci-fi as their concern was for story and adventure and logic was shelved.The characters are great from Biff Tannen played well by underrated actor Thomas F Wilson whom is one of my favorite fictional villians as throughout the film series he's had several versions of himself about as many as any Time Lord from ""Doctor Who"". He's a villain you love to hate, yeah, he's basically a bully whom I normally despise but here it's handled right where he's a person you easily can despise but have fun with at the same time. He has some of the best lines, but I think what really makes him stand out is the fact that he's an idiot. Despite the guy being big and strong, having the best car, it's all really just a way to pass himself as cool, the guy literally thinks he's really cool even though in reality everyone around him knows he a dirtbag.But of course, the two characters that really make the film are Marty and Doc Emit Brown played by two of my favorite actors Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd. These two are defiantly one of my favorite duos, both play off each other and balance each other out well.Marty McFly is great he's one of my favorite fictional protagonists because he's someone I can easily emphasize with as I was a kid from the 80's and I can epaphisize with bits of his persona. As he's a teen from the 80's, as he's into skateboarding, music, camcorders, and a lot of things in the 80s, I'm a kid from the 80's I was into that stuff too. He's kind of on the rebellious side, but he's more of a silent rebel as he doesn't always feel a total need to follow every rule, as he sometimes undermines the school principal, even I'm like that sometimes. But what I like about him is he's a person that has big dreams and ambitions, he wants his band to play in big events and also make music in the music world, however he has faced his series of rejections yeah, I can emphasize with that with my acting auditions; however he doesn't give up despite how much it hurts. Though also has dreams of love with his significant other Jennifer played well by Claudia Wells whom I thought was kind of hot, you really get a good feel for her and both of them as they've been a couple for a long time.I really like how Marty reacts to the 1950's decade, since he a kid from the 80's it's easy for me to emphasize with him since I was one to. To some people that either lived or close the decade of the 50's or historians that have some fascination with it, it would be a dream come true to be able to come back to it. But for a person like Marty and myself, we wouldn't really like it not to say it's a place I wouldn't mind visiting but not one I'd want to say in ; for one thing Marty traveled their unintentionally and with time travel machines you'd have the freedom to stroll out the door anytime you want but his freedom has been prohibited so that sucks. However, I really like in the first sequence of going to 1950's Hill Valley how disoriented and even scared he looks, I'm sure that would be how we would react to walking to a decade long gone it's like walking into another world. From seeing vintage cars, you would see in a car museum being driven conveniently, old songs you'd hear on an oldies but goodies on a sat radio station being played as if they've just made the billboard, certain things that aren't around yet like video games or further seasons of ""Doctor Who"", it wouldn't exactly be like going to a vacation spot.It's also funny in the film how Marty in an inadvertent way affects things not just from how he brings his parents together but also how may 'be he was one factor that may have helped get certain things in our modern-day culture started. Like the music he plays in the school dance, the skateboard, you name it. To me that's part of the what makes the film it funny and fascinating, it really shows how one person can really have a big affect on time without know it but also how one person truly can make a difference. Though it also brings up the parallel dynamic between both Marty and the 50's decade as both were a time of great changes from youth to culture.Doc Brown is just great as he's is a genius but is a bit childlike as he does have a bit of an eccentricity from his hairstyle which always seems to be stick up to even how rapidly inventive he is. However, he does have a good dose of common sense and wisdom which keeps him from not flying off the road but also able to interact properly and mentor Marty. But one thing about him I can easily emphasize with is on how fast he is, he the kind of person that loves to do lots of things and get things done but is aware he has limited time to do them. Like in one scene, he has built a rather elaborate scale model of the town but is apologetic that he didn't have enough time to paint and give it details, despite the fact it's looks great all the same. I just find that a little funny because I'm sort of like that myself where sometimes I get one thing done but there is one other thing I haven't got done yet or I wanted to do within the given time.I really love the DeLorean, it's my second favorite time traveling machine next to the Tardis on ""Doctor Who"" which you know is my first. Making a time traveling machine out of a car was unheard of at the time, personal I thought it was a cool idea and really is a lot more convient because with it you will not just travel back or forwards in time, but you'd be able to drive within that time period where ever you need to go and hide it better by driving to a spot. The effects on that DeLorean are cool just every time it travels in time it just leaves a vapor trail of fire on the road. Music is also great this film has probably one of the best soundtracks I know. From the theme song from Alvin Silvestri which perfectly reflects the movie as it has an adventurous tone. Another trademark are two other songs from the film ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News. As well as a few familiar oldies but goodies tracks, most notably the song ""Johnny Be Good"" at the dance.There are lots of fun moments I won't say them all since there are so many which makes the better because there's not one dull moment, from the big highlight for me is the Skateboard sequence which is one of my favorite chase scenes, here it's a skateboard skating away from an automobile. When you think about it being on a skateboard does have its advantages as Marty is able to ride on sidewalks and certain roadways and areas that an automobile would have a hard time accessing, which means plenty of opportunities to outmaneuver his opponent. But also, the fact that Marty is using a skateboard in the 1950's decade alone is really cool, since they didn't have skateboards back then. To even the small moments my favorite which is to me one of the best reference jokes ever when Marty puts himself in the Rad suit and is tricking George to asking Lorene out by mixing up two popular sci-fi franchises, that segment always cracks me up being a sci-fi fan.Well I've said enough, ""Back to the Future"" is a timeless classic that has the millage that goes beyond time.Rating: 4 stars",Back to the Future
92,freemantle_uk,A Childhood Classic,10,5 September 2009,"Back to the Future is a film that for people of my generation would have growth up with, along with other important films like the original Indiana Jones films, Stars Wars trilogy, the first two Alien films, the Rocky Series and Mad Max 1 and 2 (just to name a few). Here is a fun family film that has stood the test of time.Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), is a 17-year-old teenager living in Hill Valley, California. He has a loving family, a good girlfriend and helps a mad scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). But he lives in a geeky family, his dad George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by his supervisor and avoids confrontation, his mum Lorraine (Lea Thompson) has conservative values and doesn't like Marty's relationship with Jennifer (Claudia Wells), and Marty's brother and sister are generally geeky. One Dr. Brown, aka 'Doc', asks for Marty's assistance and records the experiments with his next invention, a time machine (in the design of a DeLorean DMC-12). The test seems successful until Libyan terrorists kill 'Doc' and whilst on the run Marty ends up travelling back in to 1955. Whilst in 1955 Marty meets both his mum and dad as teenagers, and interferes with how they met. By doing this he messes up the time-space continuum and risks his own existences. The younger version of Lorraine falls for Marty, not know he is her future son; adding both to comedy and general creepiness. It's a race against time, both to get back to 1985 and to insure destiny is fulfilled by his setting up his parents.Back to the Future is a family sci-fi comedy which is a symbol of its time. It works as a fish out of water comedy, teen comedy and a general look at time travel. They is a simple plot and theme about Marty finding out who his parents are and looks at the similarities and differences of live in the 50s and 80s. The aim of the filmmakers was to make a fun film, and Robert Zemeckis does this. He is a protégé of Steven Spielberg and he keeps the story simple and entertaining. He also shows his skills as a special effects director which in this film were very good. The special effects help the story, but don't overshadow it. They is a very good script to this film, mixing drama and comedy, and hasn't dated badly. The film is humorous and light-hearted. The humour is not crude, like it it in some family films. There is a strong story and with good messages for kids about standing up to bullies and respecting your parents. Michael J. Fox was perfectly casted for the lead role and there are many excellent supporting cast members. Lea Thompson was perfectly pretty as Lorraine and Crispin Glover was fine as a needy kid. Christopher Lloyd and Thomas F. Wilson were really excellent as the mentor and the villain.Back to the Future is an influential family film. It is a mark of pop-culture with this movie being parodied in Family Guy and Futurama. It is Robert Zemeckis' best film (though Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a close second).",Back to the Future
93,dee.reid,My favorite movie from 1985,10,7 January 2007,"Why is ""Back to the Future"" my favorite movie from 1985? Because that was the year I was born! I'll be turning 22 this year, as will this film. Robert Zemeckis has had an astounding career over the last half-century, with other hits including ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) and ""Cast Away"" (2000). But his best will always be ""Back to the Future,"" at least to me. In 1985, wacky, frizzy-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents time travel, that is he builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. A series of harrowing events forces wise-cracking teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to take the DeLorean for a test drive through time, 30 years back to 1955, before he was even born. Never mind the scientific improbabilities and paradoxes present in the script, but McFly must find a way back to '85, before his future is erased by events in the present. You see, he has inadvertently altered the course of events that will lead to his then-teenage parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) meeting and falling in love, and now he must try to get them together with a young Doc Brown's help while also facing off against Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the local tough. ""Back to the Future"" remains a comedy classic, due largely to its mix of special effects fantasy and laugh-out loud moments. The performances are excellent, especially from Fox, who is one of my favorite actors and I do wish him well in the future with his fight against Parkinson's Disease.10/10",Back to the Future

95,drqshadow-reviews,Charm and Character Make Up For a Few Plot Mishaps,9,24 July 2011,"Marty McFly's first ride is still every bit as charming and entertaining as ever, although the soundtrack seems to get more dated every time I hear it - I caught no less than five different instances of ""Power of Love"" in the first ten minutes of screen time. Despite the inherent plot issues involved with any time travel film, this is still a great adventure with a diverse, likable cast and career-defining performances from Christopher Lloyd, Michael J Fox and Crispin Glover. Even though I could recite several lines verbatim from the dark recesses of my memory, I still caught myself laughing at the jokes like they were brand new, and grinning like a fool from start to finish. Like many high profile BR discs, the picture on this was almost *too* stunning - you can actually see some of the ""old person"" makeup flaking off around certain characters' necks in the '80s scenes. A few early moments are excessively grainy, but once the plot gets moving, that clears up for good.",Back to the Future

Do I really need to summarize? The original Back to the Future is one of the decade's most ambitious, identifiable smash hits, a genre-straddling film that's still effective more than thirty years later.With a warm, slightly off-kilter personality, fabulous characters, a craftily complex plot and a fantastic musical score, there's no shortage of reasons why it's aged so well. Perhaps most impressive is the cast; one perfect fit after another. Michael J. Fox, at the onset of his overnight fame, is equal parts driven and perplexed by the chaos surrounding his life. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover each nail double roles as deflated, defeated adults and their glowing, energetic teenage counterparts. Christopher Lloyd might be the best of them all as Doc Brown, the forever-old, slightly deranged mastermind who never completely believes he's accomplished his life's greatest goal.The story has a few holes (what time-skipping adventure doesn't) and sometimes tries to be a little too cute, but such shortcomings are easily brushed aside as the large/small adventures unfold. Expertly written, directed, acted and produced, with memorable lines a'plenty and a charming, optimistic spirit, it's a well-worn favorite.",Back to the Future

I'm not as into it as I suspect a lot of shirt haired students of gender studies are but I enjoy how much they probably enjoy it.Really feel good stuff that earns its status as feel good stuff and always visually pleasant.

98,alindsay-al,An epic fun sci fi adventure,10,2 March 2016,"I have finally had the chance to review back to the future which is definitely one of my favourite films of all time. The premise of this film sees a teenager sent from the year 1985 to 1955 by accident and make sure his parents reunite. Michael j fox is absolutely fantastic as marty, he was so lovable as the character and just straight away you want to like marty. He has allot of charisma to him that makes you truly care about his situation. Christopher Lloyds performance as doc brown is pretty iconic and he is great in this film. He is a really funny character that is very charismatic, plus his chemistry with fox is brilliant. All the rest of the characters are great, whether its the bully biff or the younger versions of martys parents they all do a great job. The story is great with the time travelling aspect being really fun and enjoyable but also brings about allot of drama from it. The script has some great humour and some good drama in it that makes it a truly great movie. The style is very fast paced which totally works for this film. The effects look great especially considering the film is 31 years old. Overall this film is a must see and one of the greatest films ever.",Back to the Future
99,jimbo-53-186511,It never gets old,9,11 January 2021,"17 year old student Marty McFly inadvertently sends himself 30 years back in time in mad scientist Emmett Brown's time-travelling Delorean. However, when Marty meets back up with Emmett Brown in the past he learns that his future is in jeopardy unless he can make his parents fall in love...In the main Back To The Future is a science-fiction film, but it also functions well as a romance and as a comedy (albeit to slightly lesser extents). The science-fiction element is wacky and crazy (which fits the narrative as Emmett Brown could easily be accused of both of those things), but whilst wackiness and craziness could carry a film if done right they won't make a film brilliant - you need a good story and a decent chunk of fun and Back To The Future wins on both counts. Although Zemeckis gives the film a light-hearted tone, the story of Marty's parents blossoming romance is handled surprisingly sensitively and is a romance you want to believe in (and that means a lot coming from someone like me who generally despises the romance genre).Christopher Lloyd is arguably the star of the show here and his over-the-top zany performance in this film is something that always sticks in the mind - Lloyd is a talented actor who has appeared in many good films and his infectious energy is always a joy to behold. As bully-boy Biff Thomas F Wilson threatens to outshine Lloyd with his thuggish swagger and bravado (this is intended as a compliment). It's a testament to Wilson's acting ability when you think how convincing he is in this respective role given that he is apparently a really nice guy in real life. Michael J Fox and Lea Thompson are good in their roles, but they don't quite make the same impression as Lloyd and Wilson.The film also has a slight satirical edge to it; the future fashion being poked fun of in the past (Marty's 'life preserver' and Marty's Calvin Klein boxer shorts which Lorraine believed have been personally engraved in his name) and the ridiculous idea of a 1950's actor being a US president in the 1980's - obviously this really happened, but can imagine it being far-fetched in the 1950's.To top it off Back to the future has some wonderful musical numbers and a pacey narrative which makes for an involving film from start to finish. Zemeckis has made some cracking films, but this for me will always be up there with the best of them.

Certain elements require a suspension of disbelief, however it's so enjoyable you get swept along with it.The plot is simple but superbly detailed in how it takes a number of characters through individual arcs and focuses on period details, particularly in emphasising the fish out of water angle of Marty McFly as an 80s kid trapped in his parents era. Practically everything that happens links to something else that occurs at a later point in the story. Whilst doing all of the above it takes us on a highly enjoyable and thrilling adventure.One of its biggest strengths is a sharp script that provides great comedy, lots of cultural references and quotable lines from many characters such as Marty, Doc, George, Lorraine and Biff.This is a movie with a number of memorable scenes such as at Twin Pines Mall, the Enchantment Under The Sea dance and the lightening bolt at the clock tower. In fact, the movie creates an almost living and breathing character out of the fictional town of Hill Valley as we have great scenes in numerous locations such as Lou's Diner, Lyon Estates and Courthouse in different eras.The visuals are brilliant with great cinematography, period detail, costumes and visual effects. The DeLorean car used as the basis for the time machine is an inspired creative idea and is rightfully now a pop culture icon.There is a fantastic soundtrack with a great mixture of original score and pop music. It goes without saying that the general sound mixing and effects are superb.Michael J Fox does a star turn as Marty and effortlessly carries the story with fantastic charisma and performance. He is supported wonderfully by Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Thomas F Wilson, who all play memorable characters in both time periods.

A major hit when it first came out which I think had more to do with how well it was marketed then how good of a movie it was.  Michael J. Fox carries the film with his charm and his ability to do physical comedy.  The story jumps back and forth from serious to silly which keeps us giggling and the good guys win in the end which usually makes for a winner at the box office. The focus of most of the comedy has to do with Michael trying to get his parents together despite his unexpected intervention into their lives and being his mom's flame for awhile putting a damper on his real mom and dad getting together.  It all works out in the end of course and we're ready for part ii in the series which is predicted by the ""To be continued..."" as the credits roll.",Back to the Future

107,gcd70,All time favourite,8,29 May 2007,"""Back to the Future"" is the most entertaining, fun-filled movie of all time. Not to mention the fact that after first seeing this at the age of fifteen (and going back for more ten times), it remained my very favourite film for years.Absolutely wonderful balance of humour, drama and fantasy that finds teenager Marty McFly accidentally transported back in time to 1955. There he inadvertently prevents his parents from meeting, and thus sets off an hilarious chain of events; all of which he must fix before he goes ""Back to the Future"". Fox is perfectly cast as Marty and Lloyd is in outrageously funny form as 'Doc' Emmette Brown. Alan Silvestri's music and the incidental pop soundtrack are very enjoyable. The script from co-writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is pure genius. Special effects are brilliant! Pure entertainment!!Monday, June 10, 1991 - Golden Twin Cinema, BendigoOnce again pure adventure and entertainment. A perfect combination of comedy and fantasy. Filmed well and great fun to watch!Wednesday, January 15, 1992 - Laser DiscI still recall the first time I ever saw this pic. It was September the 14th, 1985, and as an unsuspecting fifteen year old, I went along by chance to see ""Back to the Future"" at the Balwyn Cinema (then only a single cinema complex). I was totally blown away, and rushed out to see it again twelve days later, at the old Forum cinema (remember that place?), being bedazzled once more. Several excursions later (including a few to the Australia Twin in Collins St.) and I still couldn't get enough.This was my twelfth trip to the movies to see this blockbuster of 1985. Eleven and a half years on, it is now difficult to fathom what attracted me so inexorably to this highly entertaining, yet hardly classic film. Perhaps Rob Zemeckis and Bob Gale's ingenious story of bewildered teen Marty McFly's journey back in time is finally wearing thin on me. Oh what sacrilege.The fact remains though that this film is, as I've said many times before, pure entertainment. Visual and sound effects during the time traveling sequences are dazzling, art direction and set decoration both brilliantly recreate 1955 (they received an Academy Award nomination) as do costumes. Zemeckis and Gale were also nominated for their script.The pop soundtrack, including Lindsay Buckingham, Eric Carmen and Huey Louis and the News, was instrumental in the film's success, and Alan Silvestri's music is an unsung hero in the proceedings. Finally, the cast are a real delight. Fox is the perfect choice for the fish-out-of-water McFly, and Christopher Lloyd is superb as the nutty Doc Brown. Lea Thompson is suitably smitten as Marty's mom, Lorraine, and Crispin Glover is a scene stealer as the geeky George McFly, whether he is under a ton of make-up - aged forty-seven - or bumbling around as a seventeen year old in 1955.

111,a_chinn,80s classic is still works for Gen-Z,10,14 July 2021,"My my kids got two days in a row of my pandemic Film Appreciation Course, this time introducing them to the 80s time travel classic ""Back to the Future."" My kids laughed at all the right parts, thought Marty and Doc funny, and were completely caught up in the excitement and suspense of the clocktower finale. During that clocktower finale, one of my daughters, who wasn't familiar with ""suspense"" as a film term said ""This movie is giving me ANXIETY!"" They were completely into the film, just as I was when I was 13 or 14 when I first saw it in the theater. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who only had three movie credits to his name before this, the very funny TV movie ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" the very funny and very crass Kurt Russell comedy ""Used Cars,"" and then ""Romancing the Stone,"" which was an unexpected hit that led the studios to take a look at his other projects. If you're wondering how Spielberg got involved in this film, Zemeckis and his writing partner, Bob Gale, wrote Spielberg's infamous bomb ""1941,"" which I think is an under appreciated comedy classic I still love to this day. Spielberg also produced Zemeckis' first film ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and when the studio was uncomfortable with him selecting a first time director he stuck by Zemeckis but had to promise the studio if things went badly he'd take over as director. But I digress. In summary, ""Back to the Future"" has a great cast (even look fast for Billy Zane in his film debut as one of Biff's toadies), terrific humor, and genuine heart. Although seemingly lightweight, ""Back to the Future"" really is an American film classic. FUN FACT(s)! When Thomas F. Wilson, who played Biff, is asked about this movie by fans, he'll often hand them a postcard of frequently asked questions as a timesaver, which reads:""I'm Tom Wilson. I was in all three 'Back To The Future' movies. Michael J. Fox is nice. I'm not in close contact with him. Christopher Lloyd is nice. He is a very shy man. Crispin Glover is unusual, but not as unusual as he sometimes presents himself. We got along nicely. Lea Thompson is nice. Eric Stoltz originally played Marty, but was fired due to performance issues. The first movie was shot in 1984 and '85. The sequels were shot 'back to back,' never before attempted by a movie studio. The hoverboards didn't really fly, we were hanging by wires from a crane. The manure was made of peat moss, cork, dirt, and a food agent that made it sticky. The Delorean was an inferior automobile, and nearly impossible for a person of normal size like myself to enter and exit. There are many tiny plot points hidden in the movies, but I don't know what they are. Among many improvisations of the set, I coined the term 'butthead,' as well as 'Make like a tree, and get out of here.' The third movie was my favorite, since I got to learn western skills like riding, roping, quick draw, and shooting a six-shooter, a great adventure for a guy from Philadelphia.""",Back to the Future
112,davidmvining,The perfect blockbuster,10,16 November 2020,"This movie is just plain fun, and it manages that because of how Zemeckis approaches a plot heavy film. It's been obvious from the beginning of his career with I Wanna Hold Your Hand that the two Bobs (Zemeckis and Gale) loved to put characters with clearly defined characteristics through a puzzle of a plot with clearly defined goals to pull them through. The likeable characters are the grease that keeps the plot running smoothly, providing a key to the film's success. When the two Bobs were in film school, they were surrounded by others who loved the French New Wave, and they just wanted to make Hollywood films of fun. With Back to the Future, they succeeded just so completely.The interesting thing about Marty McFly is that he doesn't have an arc in this film. At all. He doesn't grow. He learns a bit about his parents but the knowledge doesn't change him. At the end of the film, he's exactly the same person as he was in the beginning. This seems to fly in the face of everything screenwriters usually want to put into a movie, but it works really well because of the kind of adventure Marty gets sent on. He is presented with a problem (being sent back in time to 1955 from 1985), and he needs to solve it. In order to get there he is presented with a series of obstacles that he must overcome, including his mucking up of his own parents' uninspiring and flawed relationship. That's where we get character growth, in secondary characters that have a direct relationship to Marty himself and his journey back.So, Marty and his older crazy scientist friend, Doc Brown, get attacked by Libyans at Doc's first successful test of his time machine made out of a DeLorean. The choice to make the time machine out of a futuristic looking car is a great one on the part of the movie. It allows for the time travel dynamic with exciting visceral thrill at the same time. It also allows for an exciting climax, of course. Doc gets killed and Marty barely gets away, accidentally getting sent back in time without any extra fuel (some plutonium), and needing to find a way home to 1985. Before he ever gets to managing the beginning of a plan, he ends up bumping into both of his parents as he explores this new, brighter, cheerier nightmare world that he must escape.The mix of his exploration of the new world and his discovery of his parents as young people is expertly intertwined so that we never feel like we're coasting without momentum. His break of the history that brought his parents together is handled quickly, allowing Marty personal stake in getting involved in his parents' relationship at the very beginning. The 1955 Doc Brown encourages this because of vague concerns about the end of the universe and some concern for Marty himself who's due to disappear if things don't get set right. The stakes are clear and make sense to Marty's character. It allows the audience to happily go along with Marty on this journey through time. It doesn't matter that he doesn't change. It matters that the audience likes him and roots for him as he faces obstacle after obstacle on his clearly defined journey that just happens to be fun at the same time.The clear line of action ends up forming and Marty has to balance preparing for the historical lightning strike that he and Doc will use to send him back to the future while, at the same time, trying to repair the relationship he tore apart before it formed. The normal expectation of character change happens around Marty's father, George, who can no longer just fall into a romantic relationship with the pretty Loraine, but he must earn her affection. That earning, at the ironic guidance of his own far more confident son, turns George into a better, more confident man.The puzzle-like nature of the plot, reminiscent of and superior to what Zemeckis and Gale pulled off in their earlier pictures, all falls into place marvelously through the movie's climax. The clock tower, established in the opening minutes, the bad starter on the DeLorean, the tree falling on the cable, the visual call back to both the famous image of Harold Lloyd from Safety Last! and a clock at the beginning of the film, and more all come together in perfect harmony to give us the cathartic release as we watch Marty and Doc overcome all of the challenges to complete their goal.The film has all of the hallmarks of a Zemeckis and Gale production at their most enjoyable. The long opening shot that introduces Doc's workshop is evocative of Hitchcock's opening shot of Rear Window, revealing key pieces of character and plot information elegantly. It's paced quickly, never slogging down in unnecessary details, always successfully pushing the story forward. It's energetic, fun, and expertly crafted. This is Zemeckis and Gale have a ball and inviting the audience along for the fun.",Back to the Future

114,Movie-ManDan,"Heart, Hilarity, and Brains.",10,8 December 2017,"'Back To The Future' can't be unloved by people. It was loved back when it came out in 1985 and its success has only grown. It has become a pop culture phenomenon worthy of all the success and praise it gets.Christopher Lloyd just finished 'Taxi' and was doing a slew of successful films. Eric Stoltz was making a name for himself. But at the last minute, Stoltz was fired and 'Family Ties' own Michael J. Fox was replaced as protagonist alongside Christopher Lloyd. This co-stars some other up-and- comers that would go on to become household names.Fox stars as Marty McFly. He's a high school senior who loves his girlfriend, tries to get gigs with his band, must deal with a mean principal and a weird family. He is also an errand boy for the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who Marty calls ""Doc."" Doc is constantly coming up with odd inventions and nobody can take him seriously, but he does sustain Marty's interest. His latest invention is a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Since that car has been discontinued, everybody's immediate association with it is a time machine. Doc calls Marty to test it at 1am so they can be in complete privacy. But they are soon found by terrorists who Doc fraudulently squeezed plutonium away from. Marty narrowly escapes...The first act is getting to know Marty and his family and Doc. The subplot with the terrorists is also important. Marty escapes by accidentally entering 1955 on the date Doc got the envision for the time machine. Marty bumps into some people from his own present and tells them their fate. But it is his parents that he encounters that will mess up the timeline forever. His mom is a player who developed the hots for Marty instead of his dad. Marty completely screwed up the day they met. His dad is a total wimp too scared to ask his mother out or stand up to bully Biff Tannen. Marty is a hip daredevil who is the key in changing his father for the better and tricking him. This story with Marty trying to reconnect his parents is hilarious. Its my favourite aspect oft he film. Then there's Biff Tannen, who is the best bully in film history. I'm not condoning bullying, but Biff is hilarious. How can Marty return to 1985? His escape was too abrupt to retrieve any plutonium for his way back, so he's stuck. Or is he? Doc says a bolt of lightning is the only thing of equivalent charge to plutonium. Hill Valley's (the film's setting) historic clock towers struck by lightning and it hasn't rung since. Next week will be the day it happens, so Doc and Marty construct a plan for the charge to hit the DeLorean and send Marty back to the future. Funny how these three very important events (Marty's parents meeting, Doc coming up with the idea for the time machine, and the clock tower destruction) take place over the course of the same week.As a time travel film, there are lots of holes and plot errors that cannot be unseen. The wonderment is what makes films like this so groundbreaking. But at least there's enough smarts around this. As I mentioned earlier, Marty dealing with a week in the 50s with his parents is my favourite aspect. The whole ""fish out of water"" bit is done so well and so funny. It culminates with Marty doing an edgy rendition of Chuck Berry's ""Johnnie B. Goode"" which is my favourite scene in all of cinema. His imitations of various guitar legends such as Eddie Van Halen and Pete Townsend make it even more funny than it is. This movie makes me feel so wonderful each and overtime I see it (which is a lot). it is spiritually uplifting with heart and comedy to make it fun, and complexity to take it seriously.It should always remain the best movie ever made about time travel. 10/10",Back to the Future
115,invisibleunicornninja,An Enjoyable Classic,9,13 February 2018,"This is overall a very funny and entertaining classic that can be enjoyed by most everyone. There are many plot conveniences, but luckily none of them are a result of characters being stupid. Though not all of the characters are intelligent, they're not too dumb to breathe. The characters that are dumb aren't unrealistically so. All the actors' performances are very good. Most of the jokes are pretty clever, and there are a lot of consistencies within the movie's world that other movies wouldn't have. This movie is kind to people who like to use their brains. Even though the effects are old, they're still pretty good and unlike the music I wouldn't describe them as cheesy. The plot is entertaining and easy to follow.",Back to the Future
116,RainDogJr,"Maybe someday your name will be in lights saying ""Marty McFly tonight""",10,4 July 2008,"Before yesterday, 03 July 2008, I haven't seen this Robert Zemeckis picture since long time ago, I think actually since I was a kid, when this was one of the regular pictures showed on National TV together with the part II and the part III. I think saw the Back to the Future trilogy at least two or three times yet right now I don't remember a lot of things from part II and III just like before yesterday of part I. So right now I'm glad I saw this one after so many years; Back to the Future is the quintessential movie entertainment with two memorable characters, one memorable car and, of course, a magnificent time travel story full of fun and romance but not in a near or far future but in 1955. Well in the film is 1985 and Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is in high school, loves to play guitar with his band, is ready to spend more time with his girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) and the scientist and inventor Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is his friend. Here we also meet Marty's parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson), and also the abusive boss of George, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson). But is the Doc the one who is going to change everything for Marty with his latest invention that could be his own masterpiece: a De Lorean that works as a time machine.I really like how in this picture the time travel stuff was used in a simple but great way. You can travel to any time but not to any place and of course, once in the past, anything you do will have consequences. The picture plays again in a simple way to focus just in the story of Marty's parents in 1955, in high school. Since everybody that Marty knows seems to be just as they are in 1985 (except his mother) his problem with the time machine is in good hands with a young Doc that looks exactly as in 1985 (funny). So the issue is just to get together George and Lorraine but that is going to be a -funny- problem since Marty has already replace his father and now he is the object of love of his own mother!Many funny details with Marty Calvin Klein Darth Vader McFly and even what could be just a pretext to use one of the greatest songs in rock and roll history (if that was the case is still good since the song is Johnny B. Goode) turns to be just a great, memorable and hilarious scene with the cousin of Chuck. And in the end everything was just right on time for Marty and Doc, even way better, and leaves everything for more pictures.Cast: Both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are terrific; in the case of J. Fox this is the role for what I know him and eventually the one for what I always recognize him. Almost the same for Lloyd but he was also in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (Robert Zemeckis, 1988) and in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Milos Forman, 1975). Crispin Glover is also terrific as a really weird but eventually lucky character.Conclusion: Back to the Future is just a classic family entertainment with a magnificent story. That said, what else I could add to my -obvious- conclusion? I think just this: 9.5 out of 10",Back to the Future

118,PredragReviews,Huey Lewis & The News to boot!,8,22 April 2016,"Back to the future"" is a lesson in movie-making. The script is really good, the director (Zemeckis) does what is expected of him, and the cast is perfect for the characters.The story itself is hardly original, but how it is told is outstanding. Not only that this film is funny, it succeeds in creating a certain atmosphere that is hard to describe. An atmosphere that you can feel and which distinguishes good movies from classics. You really connect with all the characters on screen. Zemeckis' first & only choice was Michael J. Fox for the role of Marty. Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play, but there are other great performances here, as well. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as ""Doc"" Brown, and Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie. There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950's, and some of the gags based on Fox's out-of-time character are classic. Also, this movie is recognizable by his amazing soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri, including ""Power of Love,"" by Huey Lewis and the News. The track was a billboard charter at the time of the film, and it's rhythm and beat are still catchy. Overall, it's a good sci-fi film with the right amount of tension and laughs, and even some really touching moments.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Back to the Future

In all honesty this movie is probably not a ""9"", but growing up with with it, I attach huge sentimental value to it. The script is a work of art as is the energy, pacing, and acting. The cast and director really hit the right blend of humor and adventure rarely seen in movies even now. I particularly loved Christopher Lloyd as the manic absent-minded professor. His comic facial expressions and clumsiness come off great. No part of this movie is poorly done, and the accompanying music is superb.

120,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,The future has arrived,10,22 October 2015,"Ah, distinctly I remember, it was my grandfather (may he rest in peace) who first showed this film to me, on video when I was a very small child. It was him and his second wife, and two of their friends, and me, and distinctly I also remember vividly immediately after the film was over, I said, ""I want to watch it again!"" 30 years after its initial release, this is still a hilarious, wonderfully wacky sci-fi/ comedy/ romance/ action flick, and one of the very few films which even attempts to cover all of those bases, and does so extremely well, as it sends a 17 years old 30 years into the past in a DeLorean built by a nutjob inventor, Doc Emmet L. Brown, brilliantly played by Christopher Lloyd. An over-the-top satire of mad scientists, when he shouts, ""It works!"", it reminded me of Dr. Frankenstein shouting ""It's alive!"", upon seeing his creation. Even the film's ending still had suspense, I was still on the edge of my seat (as the cliché goes) when Doc was on the edge of the clocktower, lightning bolts crashing and crackling, again similar to film Frankenstein's creation of the monster. There is also a sad, tragic feel to a few scenes, as Marty fears for his friend's life. As Biff, Thomas Wilson is hysterical also, the kind of over-sized nitwit most of us knew in high school, who we waited to see get their comeuppance. A childish baby, stuck in a large man's body. Some well selected and timed oldies, and original score was perfect, not a single note misused, nor was there a single line of dialogue misused, out of place, or unnecessary. The same can be said about the cinematography, which includes several of Dean Cundey's long takes (opening shot in the Doc's garage, and the unveiling of the DeLorean. One of my all time favourites, 10/ 10, easily. Upon seeing it again in the cinema yesterday (21 October 2015, Back To The Future day) me and the entire audience were in stitches all throughout, and the film actually received a standing ovation when it finished.",Back to the Future
121,philip_vanderveken,One of the finest Sci-Fi movies ever,8,2 August 2005,"Even though I'm still convinced that the eighties are one of the worst decades in recent history when it comes to movies and music and even though I never liked Sci-Fi movies, there is one big exception to that rule. In my opinion ""Back to the Future"" is not only one of the best movies in the genre, it's also in my list of all time favorite movies. When I saw it for the first time, I remember to be blown away by it. But than again, I was only 10 years old, not exactly an age on which you've already seen many really good movies to which you can compare another one. But even now, 20 years after its first release and after I've seen hundreds of movies, I still like it a lot.It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of all kinds of (useless) machines. But this time he has invented something that is much more interesting. He has created a plutonium-powered time machine based on a DeLorean. But when something goes wrong, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955, the time in which his parents still were young. Not only has he got to adapt to this entirely new environment, he also has to make sure that nothing is changed, because that might have serious consequences for the future...I guess the best reason why this movie works so well and feels so timeless is because they don't use the time machine to go forward. Instead of showing us the future, which wouldn't look exactly like it is right now, they have chosen to go back 30 years, a time period which they new very well and could recreate perfectly. If they hadn't done this, the movie would have felt dated one day and no-one would have liked it because it was far from possible. Another good thing about this movie is the acting. Take for instance Michael J. Fox. Not everything that he has done in his career was very successful, but in this movie he shines. I truly believe that this is one of his best performances ever. The same for Christopher Lloyd. Even though his Dr. Emmett Brown looks like if he could have come out of a cartoon, his acting gives the character something likable and makes you forget about that 'problem'.Overall I really liked this movie a lot. It's one of the finest examples in Sci-Fi movies and I can keep watching it time after time. That's why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than 8/10.",Back to the Future
122,screenman,An Old Favourite,9,23 September 2008,"I love this movie. Although aimed primarily at a younger audience on account of its high-school-aged hero, there's really something for everyone.It's got adventure. It's got excitement. It's got danger. It's got great comedy. And it's got so much more.Released in 1985, its special-effects are minimal, and thankfully predate the now-obligatory CGI, requiring some practical imagination to make the thing seem plausible. Basically; everything's in the DeLorean sports car. After that, what is needed is an authentic representation of the 1950's. I'm no expert, but the period seems believable to me.Camera-work, lighting, and sound-effects are top-drawer. There are some wonderfully realised ambiences. Music - both incidental and theme are well chosen. Huey Lewis And The News supply the anthem 'Power Of Love' in fine, thumping riff, whilst additional pieces give a tremendous sense of urgency. It really is spot-on.This movie brought the unfortunate Micheal J Fox into deserved prominence. His acting skills and comic timing are excellent, here. It's so sad that incurable illness has blighted such a promising career. He and Christopher Lloyd make excellent foils. They are naturals as a comic duo.Young McFly goes back in time to find his young father as a bullied wimp, a failed writer, and a peeping-tom. He also accidentally upstages his father in his mother's eyes and risks a dose of temporal incest. Somehow he has to put things right before going back to the future. He does - but some details get overlooked, with funny and happy consequences. Relationships are handled with a light and deft touch. It never plods. It never becomes maudlin or lachrymose or excessively sentimental.There are several plot-holes in the story. And if you get hung-up on the stuff about time-travel and paradox crap, you're missing the point. You're not supposed to take it seriously. It's a fun movie! And it delivers in spades.Some have described this as the best time-travel movie and I'm inclined to agree. If you can't find something to laugh at then you're a lost cause.Being so successful, two sequels followed. But the surprise was gone and the humour grew progressively stale. they paled by comparison.Check-out the original. It's a collectors item and a truly great feel-good experience. I ought to give it 10 stars.",Back to the Future

It doesn't matter who you ask, I can nearly guarantee everyone has great memories of this film. It's a classic; most people would agree. The story is well-known but for the 1% of you who may not be familiar: Marty McFly is an average teenager living in 1985 until his friend Doc Emmett Brown invents a DeLorean time machine. When problems arise, Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 and he realizes that his actions may have prevented his own existence unless he can correct his mistakes. By now, everyone knows the deal: the car, the characters, and the countless memorable moments.I can't get enough of that DeLorean. It will forever be my favorite film car. Despite having been released in 1985, the effects in this film hold up surprising well. Every time I watch the DeLorean sparking up as it leaving through time, it's like watching it for the very first time. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are two of the most fun characters in cinema history in the form of Marty and Doc. They're perfect; I honestly can't imagine anyone else having been cast in those roles. Honestly, that extends to the supporting cast as well...Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Tom Wilson. I'll always love Glover's performance as Marty's father George and its a shame he didn't return for the sequel.Everyone's got a favorite moment from this film, as it's loaded with fantastic scenes. Mine would have to be Marty's initial reaction to finding himself in 1955 and his guitar performance of ""Johnny B. Goode"" at the dance. Seriously, there isn't much a person can say about this film as just about everyone's seen it and knows how fun it is.

There are things that have been done in other time travel movies before (even theories made up by one of the characters) but there are also new and maybe not as original (as I hoped) things in here to enjoy and mess your mind around.

Marty: Right. Give me a Pepsi Free. Lou: You want a Pepsi pal, you're gonna pay for it. Within that one single exchange between Back to the Future's (1985) protagonist Marty (Michael J. Fox) and the neighborhood soda jerk there are so many things going on. Marty has traveled back thirty years into the past and is slowly coming to terms/panicking about where he is and how he got there. Studebakers and old Mustangs drive by the window, the future mayor of Hill Valley (played by Donald Fullilove) mops behind him and a younger version of his father (Crispin Glover) sits right next to him. Yet all the audience is supposed to pick up is that the lingo in Hill Valley circa 1955 is completely different than what he's used to which leads to this hilarious exchange.While Pepsi Free no longer exists and Tab iswell Tab, the fact still remains that Back to the Future remains the epitome of a timeless classic. It's a classic based on its plot: a teenager who has befriended an oddball scientist (Christopher Lloyd) goes back into the past with his time machine and has to get back. It's a classic based on its sub-plot: said teenager messes up his mother and father's first meet and has to make the two fall in love before he's never born. It's a classic because of its state-of-the-art special effects which really haven't aged all that much and it's confident direction led by Robert Zemeckis. Finally it's a classic because of its humor and heart. How many times have you seen time travel in a movie and ask yourself honestly, whose done it any better?Back to the Future made full fledged movie stars out of its likable leading man Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Lloyd's Doc Brown is an unforgettable character that is permanently etched in this writers head. He's the gold standard of mad scientist that all future lab-coated eccentrics have to reach before I can deem them worthy. Fox's lovable Marty is smart, creative and surprisingly full of energy. Up until that point Fox had a regular gig on Family Ties (1982-1989) and had to work both projects averaging five hours of sleep for three months to finish the picture; it's a wonder he doesn't look like a wax statue.It is said that Robert Zemeckis had tried for months to get a meeting with Steven Spielberg before finally bursting into his office unannounced and showing him his USC student film. Spielberg (German for childhood hero) would go on to executive produce his first few movies including the solidly acted box-office failure Used Cars (1980). Around that time, Spielberg also produced films by Joe Dante, Chris Columbus and Kevin Reynolds, but it was Robert Zemeckis who left the biggest mark on cinematic entertainment. It was his attention to detail and early adoption of computer generated special effects in Back to the Future that established Zemeckis as a technical wunderkind. Zemeckis would follow the success of Back to the Future with the equally inspired Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and has since become a producer/director himself.Yet Back to the Future remains a timeless package of an auteur at his zenith. A tight, clean story told with energy and panache. It has no equal and will likely never be pushed off its perch as the king of unfettered quality entertainment. In the realm of childlike wonder, Spielberg may be king but his best film is arguably not one he has directed himself but one he produced. And that production is 1.21 gigawatts of awesome.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Back to the Future

Just everything about this film is pure golden I can't think of one thing that would make Back To The Future bad because it just one of those films that got something right from the start.The film gave us some of the most used and most creative catch praises that we are still using even more after the film's release. It's one of those films I can always sit down and enjoy because it everything that makes it a pure classic.The idea of Time travel is always pure interest and it made the film a hit from the Get go.The music in the film is just superb often times you'll find yourself thinking about the theme song because it really matches the film story throughout also ""The Power of Love"" from Huey Lewis and the News really works well to help with Marty McFly and his love for girl friend Jennifer.The cast did a excellent job with creating some of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema Michael J.Fox was brilliant as the film Main Protagonist Marty McFly he helped created a character that most could related to in their teenage years he was the right man for the job. Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown was no doubt the perfect choice, Christopher Lloyd has always been an amazing actor and like many grew up watching his performance in this film he was just phenomenal in this role one of the smarter casting choices ever he really brought the character to life. Thomas F.Wilson as Biff Tannen was quite the antagonist he just brought back all that we know and hate about bullies and makes you want to cheer for Marty.Using the DeLorean as the time travel car really gave the car it status as part of American motion picture history every time you see the DeLorean you think of Back To The Future. The effects in this film are nothing short of being magical and even today remains impressive.Back To The Future is like a fine wine only gets better with age that's saying something for this classic masterpiece I give Back To The Future a 10 out of 10 Great Scott! When this baby hits 88 miles per hour you're going to see some serious hit",Back to the Future
132,mjw2305,Pure Genius,9,15 January 2005,"Time travel is a difficult subject to cover in a movie, but Spielberg pulled if off with the Back to the Future trilogy.Michael J Fox in his finest role as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Lloyd as Doctor Emmett Brown make an unlikely pair, then again a DeLorean makes an unlikely time machine, so i guess it doesn't matter.OK so there are some plot holes (Marty the youngest Mcfly, dissapearing from the photo last) for example, but the overall impact of the film is so entertaining that bigger plot holes could have been allowed and the film would have been just as good. It's hard say why this movie is so great, or why it still looks as good as it does, even by modern standards (don't forget this is 20 years old) but if it has escaped your viewing then just see it as soon as possible and i'll bet you'll want to see the rest of the trilogy the second you finish watching it.I think it's just entertainment in its purist form.A big 9/10",Back to the Future
133,sme_no_densetsu,A timeless 80's classic,9,12 February 2015,"Fresh off the success of ""Romancing the Stone"", Robert Zemeckis parlayed his newfound clout into the highest grossing movie of 1985 - ""Back to the Future"". A combination of science fiction and nostalgia, the movie touched a chord with contemporary audiences and continues to resonate with viewers thirty years later.The movie's protagonist is Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time thirty years. After he unwittingly prevents his parents' first meeting he must make things right or else he'll nullify his own existence.Although the premise is science fictional, the treatment is more or less fantastical, with only a superficial attempt to explain the technology behind time travel. Regardless, the souped-up DeLorean and its flux capacitor make for an iconic time machine.Meanwhile, the Oscar-nominated original screenplay offers something for everyone. In addition to the overall element of science fantasy spectacle there's action, adventure, romance, comedy & even surprising dramatic depth at times.However, the story may not have come to life so vividly without the movie's well-assembled cast. Replacing Eric Stoltz after shooting had already begun, original choice Michael J. Fox was thankfully able to accept the lead role at that juncture. Today, it is difficult, if not impossible, to envision anyone better suited to the role of Marty McFly. In support, Christopher Lloyd is likewise irreplaceable as Doc Brown. The icing on the cake is Marty's parents, enthusiastically played by the lovely Lea Thompson and the always interesting Crispin Glover.Zemeckis's direction also leaves little to be desired. The movie has an attractive look throughout and even the thirty year old special effects have held up pretty well. Musically, the movie benefits greatly from Alan Silvestri's rousing orchestral score. The pair of soundtrack contributions from Huey Lewis and the News are also memorable.Overall, ""Back to the Future"" offers high concept thrills backed up by considerable film-making prowess. Iconic in many respects, the movie is among the best, and the most entertaining, of the 1980's.",Back to the Future
134,Howlin Wolf,Pure Movie Magic.,10,15 March 2001,"One of the most genuinely enjoyable movies for enjoyment's sake.  I just cannot conceive how they could have made this a better movie.   It seems like Fox was born to play McFly, and try as he might, he can never get away from the part now.  Although he's done good work elsewhere, this is the one he'll be remembered for.  His defining role.   As someone else mentioned, Lloyd overacts, but somehow I never mind.  Lea Thompson has an indefinable quality, so I won't even try.  Crispin Glover is just wonderfully weird as George McFly.  No one could have played the role like him, and I think perhaps the reason the sequels suffer a bit in comparison to this one is his absence (tighter scripting would also have helped...)  Still, don't wanna give the guy a big head, 'cos when all's said and done he aint the star of the show...   What's also impressive about this is the attention to detail.  It would have been so easy to turn out a pale imitation of what we actually got with this premise, but thankfully the film-makers didn't.  Every little in-joke and movie reference adds to the created universe and involves us more with the characters.  Thanks guys, you can tell you had a lot of fun with this movie.   Also, there is no better director than Robert Zemeckis for creating escapist cinema.  This is a bona fide classic and will be no matter how far into the future you travel...",Back to the Future

Robert Zemeckis directs the hell out of this masterpiece, and he sees time-travel as a fun and conceptual playground for character exploration and never ignoring any one line of dialogue. It's all just so... GOOD! Back to the Future has been referred to many times as one of the finest and most fun movies ever created by human talent, and I think that the praise is well-deserved for this funny, character-centric, feel-good and adventurously exciting movie. 80s galore at its absolute finest in this movie, and a movie that has aged beautifully; a movie truly ahead and outside of our time.If you haven't seen Back to the Future yet, then what the hell are you doing reading this?

138,KUAlum26,GREAT SCOTT...and Great memories!,9,12 March 2006,"HAve you ever had a movie experience from years before(let's use as an arbitrary number,five years or more)that was so vivid,so exhilarating that you could recall what day,time and even things as seemingly easy to forget as the smell and tastes of the popcorn and soda you had at the movie?For me,that was this movie,and I recall seeing it on a Sunday afternoon in July,1985. The noise and visuals were so electric that I enjoyed this film immensely. My only regret about the experience was that I didn't get a chance to redeem the ""Free Pepsi with purchase of large popcorn""discount coupons they were giving out that day!In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen crisis interrupts Doc Brown's breakthrough time-machine revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting first participant in time-travel. As if that weren't harrowing enough,he's just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching this(and,really,when SHOULDN'T you suspend some disbelief when watching Spielberg/Lucas/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably strange and pathetic as Marty's once and future dad,George),Lea Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one's mind regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his ""Romancing the Stone"" success to create an even larger-than-life action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the News(remember them?). This film isn't just a renter,this is a keeper! Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy this one,tape or DVD.",Back to the Future
139,oneguyrambling,Effortlessly entertaining and incredibly creative.,8,27 December 2011,"About once a decade a film emerges that is so original and new that it immediately raises the bar for the rest of mainstream cinema to aspire to, films that are both critically espoused and well supported at the box office.The 70s brought us Star Wars and The Godfather (1 & 2), the 90s The Matrix, Toy Story and The Sixth Sense gave us the 'big twist' ending (for better or worse), the dubbos The Lord of the Rings trilogy (seriously, how many times has it been ripped off already?) and perhaps Avatar, and this decade so far has Inception, which although flawed is an admirable attempt at breaking the mould and creating something distinctly original.The 80s was all about the adventure (Indiana Jones), Blade Runner must be mentioned and the introduction of the macho action hero (Arnie, Bruce, Sly) but at equal 4th on the IMDb Top Ranked 80s titles is a 'little' film called Back to the Future, it didn't need big explosions, huge car chases and thousands of rounds of ammunition, just a creative plot and some likable characters to inhabit it.And really that's the entire Back to the Future (BttF) trilogy in a nutshell. The films don't have a huge number of jokes, the action is OK but not mind blowing and there is essentially zero sex and violence. What it does exude in abundance is charm, charm which starts with the most likable 5 foot tall guy of the 80s and 90s, Mr Michael J Fox.Fox plays Marty McFly, a typical 80s 'teen' from Hill Valley obsessed with girls (namely his girlfriend Jennifer), skateboards and music. His family are also typical and loving, his Dad (Crispin Glover) is a nervous and timid wallflower and his Mum is slightly strict but well meaning. The entire family – especially Dad – is pushed around by a local moron named Biff who has tortured him since school age.To blow off steam McFly has a friendship with a local eccentric scientist named Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc's dabbles in everything scientific and has hundreds of wonderful inventions, none of which have set the world on fire.But all of that is about to change.Doc's latest creation is a time traveling car (a DeLoreon to be specific) that when gunned to 88mph can FF or rewind to any pre-programmed point in history. McFly is dubious but he agrees at the insistence of Doc Brown to show up at an early morning (actually late evening) trial run in a supermarket car park.Using Doc's dog Einstein as the test pilot they give the car a try, and lo and behold the thing actually works! But before they even have a chance to high five and discuss how this new invention will benefit the world Libyan terrorists unexpectedly show up and gun down the Doc, with McFly only just managing to escape in the DeLorean.This one act sets in chain a series of incredible and intricately plotted events that span 3 centuries and several generations of McFly's (and 'Biff's' for that matter) Marty initially is transported back to 1985 where he is hopelessly out of place. While there he manages to meet his two parents before they even have a chance to get together, his actions inadvertently prevent this from happening, meaning that he must somehow play matchmaker to his own folks else he remove himself from existence altogether.There's a whole lot more to the original BttF, aside from literally justifying his own existence Marty manages to invent skateboarding and rock 'n' roll in his limited stay in 1955, all the while striving to avoid actions that somehow alter the future along the way.I obviously can't go into too much detail but the ending was excellent as well.Now some 25 years later time travel in films is commonplace – even Red Dwarf and Futurama have produced excellent episodes dealing with time travel paradoxes – and yes I know about The Time Machine and the 'classic' older films dealing with the topic (that I can't name). Back to the Future managed to take a science fiction core and make it interesting to the everyday movie watcher who just wants to be entertained for a couple hours (I am trying to say 'non-geeks'), the original BttF was/and is immensely original and creative, with solid performances plural by Michael J Fox as, well many McFly's.It isn't laugh a minute or gasp inducing but you'll go a long while before you find a mainstream film this innovative and enjoyable, and the sequel was even better! Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. Somehow I admire the 2nd film more, but without the elaborate set-ups structured in this film that wouldn't be near as effective, and this film is effortlessly entertaining in any case.",Back to the Future

In case you are new to the series, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Marty McFly is down on his luck and one night, his friend Dr. Emmett Brown introduces him to the world of time travel. When Doc is shot by terrorists, Marty takes the time-traveling DeLorean and accidentally goes back to the year 1955. Marty seeks the help of the young Doc in order to get back to 1985. He meets his parents, and causes his smokin' hot mom to have a crush on him, rather than his dad. He tries to get them to fall in love at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance before he disappears from time. Will Marty get back to his time and make his parents fall in love?

142,Sirus_the_Virus,Obviously one of the best films ever.,10,3 August 2009,"The original Back to the future film was definitely the best in the series. It's even on my top five list. Back to the future is cute, funny, and an obvious classic. I know most of us have seen them, but i'll say what it's about. This is the first of three Back to the Future films. Marty Mcfly(the great Michael J. Fox) is a teen with boring parents, and a boring life and he has a girlfriend. His life is turned upside down when his friend Dr. Emmet Brown(the great Christopher Lloyd)shows him a delorean. Which is actually a time machine.That's where the entire trilogy began and the films continued after that. I love every Back to the Future film. I like the original the most, then I like parts II and III equally. The Back to the future films are nothing but fun and they're great movies. This is definitely Robert Zemekis's best film to date. He's done other great films like Romancing the stone, Beowulf, and Death Becomes her. Not one of the Back to the future films has any weakness. Back to the future is a film that should never be remade or anything. Knowing the world today, if they did remake it, then they would cast Shia Lebeouf as Marty. Michael j. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are irreplaceable. Don't remake it.",Back to the Future

144,TheUnknown837-1,There should be more comedies like this one,10,19 July 2007,"What makes a good comedy movie? Just lots of dumb, pointless humor and no real plot. But what makes a good movie? A film with every feature containing quality, even the humor. So to have a really good comedy movie, at least in my opinion, it has to have EFFECTIVE humor WITH a point behind it, mixed with a good plot, good acting, storyline, and have a realistic feeling behind it. In other words, the humor must be something believable and of the possible. And it must all blend seamlessly with the rest of the quality parts of the film. And we get all of that in Robert Zemeckis's classic science fiction/comedy film ""Back to the Future"". This is the kind of comedy film that I wish we would see more often. It's like ""Forrest Gump"", it takes a realistic approach to life and then just blends it with the humor so that the audience doesn't concentrate so much on just laughing, but also understanding the plot and characters just as they would with a serious film. And as soon as they're done laughing at the lifelike jokes, then they focus back on the rest of the film.One thing I notice about a lot of comedy films that teenagers in particular seem to cherish and love is that the humor is crude and oftentimes, disturbing. And I suppose that if ""Back to the Future"" was made for teenagers alone, then the humor would be exactly the same. In this film, there is a subplot which some might think would end up being just disturbing and agitating to the audience. But when you look at it, it's not at all uncomfortable to the viewers, but instead works out effectively by not concentrating so much on just getting an uproar out of people. Of course, there is lots of jokes in the movie, mostly because of comedian Christopher Lloyd, who is at his top notch in ""Back to the Future"" as well as ""Back to the Future 2"". Not as much in the third part of the series. But he is especially keen in the first entry of the famous trilogy. And once again, his character of Dr. Emmett Brown is goofy and funny, but also has the traits where if you bumped into a person like this on the street, you wouldn't just sit back and laugh like he was just a dumb comedy feature. The character seems like he could be a real person.""Back to the Future"" is a very great film. Not just as a comedy, but also as a science-fiction film. The explanations of the time machine aren't just thrown together as they are with many films. The time machine isn't just 'created' by the scientist and not explained how it works our what it takes. There is a fairly logical explanation, and maybe a theory, as to how time travel could be possible but it doesn't so so into depth to the point where only professors would understand what's going on. That's the thing about this film. Nothing just happens. There's an explanation and a point for everything. And that's what I like to see in all films. Whether they're serious of just plain funny. Or both.",Back to the Future
145,jeremycrimsonfox,One of the Classic Films Of The 1980's,10,4 May 2020,"Marty McFly is a teen living in Hill Valley who is called a slacker for hanging out with Dr. Emmet Brown, whom his principal says he should stay away from for being a nut job. His family is falling apart, as his father is bullied by supervisor, Biff Tannen, and his mother is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. All that changes when he meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, who reveals to the youth who is his only friend his latest invention: a time machine built into a DeLorean. However, Doc is gunned down by Libyan nationalists he ripped off to get the plutonium needed to power the vehicle, and when Marty takes it to escape, he ends up traveling back to November 5,1955, a date Doc put in while showing Marty how the time travel mechanics work, where he immediately puts his existence in jeopardy by getting his mother to crush on him, leading him to find the younger Doc in order to set things right before he no longer exists, and get back home, as the time travel depleted the plutonium.This is one of the cult classic films of the 1980's. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make a good duo in this film, Also, the story is great, as it has Marty trying to correct history after his arrival in 1955 causes the teenager who would be his mother to fall in love with him, and the action scenes and special effects are great.",Back to the Future
146,hnt_dnl,The best film of 1985,10,23 March 2008,"BACK TO THE FUTURE is the rarest of movies. It has every element imaginable in it and going for it: science fiction, fantasy, humor, action, thrills, family ties (pun intended!), and an assortment of great, oddball characters. Michael J. Fox (in his greatest accomplishment as an actor) is Marty McFly, a 1985 Hill Valley guitar-playing high-schooler who aspires to be a rock 'n roll star. He is the youngest child of working-class parents George and Lorraine McFly (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson in their best roles). George is working a dead-end job for his mean boss and high-school rival Biff (perfectly cast Thomas F. Wilson). George never realized his dream of being a science-fiction author due to primarily a lack of confidence and Marty doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. Marty also has a super hot girlfriend Jennifer (sexy Claudia Wells; I liked her much better than Elisabeth Shue in the sequels in the same role). And finally, last but not least, Marty has a mentor Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown (embodied by the great Christopher Lloyd in a performance that should have won him an Academy Award).Doc is a genius yet oddball scientist (what scientist isn't a little quirky?) builds a time machine composed of a DeLorean (remember that car? the Edsel of the 80s) and then the fun begins. At the town mall one night, Doc and Marty test out his time machine on Doc's dog Einstein and then Marty mistakenly (won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie) is transported back to 1955 in the machine and must figure a way to return home. But Marty screws up along the way to finding the young 1955 version of Doc and sets the process in motion that keeps his parents from meeting and falling in love, thereby endangering his very existence. So he and Doc have dual missions: to make his parents meet and fall in love and to fix the machine (damaged during the time travel) and get Marty, as Doc would say 'back to the future!' This is my favorite film of director Robert Zemeckis. WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and FORREST GUMP were both overrated and don't have that 're-watchability factor' that BTTF has, even though both films garnered perhaps more critical praise and acclaim in their time. But BTTF is complete, utter, enjoyable fun from beginning to end. I still find myself today being impressed by the way Michael J. Fox convincingly carried this film, at Crispin Glover's manic, hilarious, comic acting style, at how sexy Lea Thompson was in this film, and finally, at Christopher Lloyd's brilliant characterization of Doc Brown. But more impressive is the fact that even though I've seen the film a lot of times, I'm still excited by several of it's signature scenes: young Biff and his gang chasing down a skateboarding Marty, Marty's wonderful rendition of ""Johnny Be Good"" at the Enchantment-Under-The-Sea dance, and of course the pulse-pounding, thrilling climax of Marty and Doc trying to put history back in order and send Marty back to the future. It's strange that there really has been no film like this since it came out in 1985. Maybe too difficult to re-create the magic of this one. There have been a lot of time travel films, but I believe this may be the best one in all of film history! Forget about the unequal sequels. This film is the standard by which all fantasy (and time travel) films of the modern era should be measured.",Back to the Future
147,hall895,Going back again and again,10,28 April 2012,"How many movies can you honestly say you would never get tired of seeing? Most movies, no matter how notably excellent they may be, lose at least a little bit of their charm, their ability to thrill, when you've seen them a number of times. Back to the Future is one of those precious few movies for which the thrill is never gone. There's so much here. Action, adventure, humor, drama, romance. The story is fabulous. The performances are fabulous. The music is fabulous. Great characters, great dialogue, great effects. Pretty much great everything. And even if you know the movie by heart, and at this point I pretty much do, it doesn't get old. Not a bit. I'll go back in time with Marty McFly over and over again. What a fabulous journey Marty goes on. Lucky are we who are along for the ride.The story is wonderfully simple and yet incredibly intricate. Teenager Marty McFly is sent back in time, from 1985 to 1955. In 1955 the most beautiful girl you'll ever see falls for Marty. Lorraine Baines is the dream girl any guy would fall in love with...if she weren't his mother. Yes, Marty's mom now has the hots for him instead of his father. Marty has prevented his parents from falling in love. If he doesn't fix that he will be erased from existence. Of course there is also the small matter of getting back to 1985. Thankfully Marty has a friend in 1955 who can help, Doc Brown. Marty and Doc, one of the great pairings in movie history.The movie starts a little slowly as it sets itself up. But then Marty and Doc come together in that shopping mall parking lot and the magic begins. From the moment Marty hops into that DeLorean and revs it up to 88 this movie is sheer perfection. Michael J. Fox, playing Marty, is obviously the glue holding the whole thing together and he is magnificent. But Christopher Lloyd, playing Doc, may be most indispensable of all. Could there be any other Doc Brown? With gestures and reactions and facial expressions Lloyd brought this character to life in a way nobody else could. He can say it all without saying a word. Of course when he does say something that's memorable too. 1.21 gigawatts! If having the kooky Lloyd playing the exceedingly kooky Doc Brown weren't enough we also get Crispin Glover playing Marty's father George. Or would-be father once Marty screws things up. Glover is a performer quite unlike any other and he makes George his own. What a fabulous job he did. Thomas F. Wilson makes for a great villain with Biff, hated in two generations. And Lea Thompson as Lorraine? Now that's a girl worth getting run over by a car for. Thompson certainly looks the part of the dream girl but she proves to be much more than just a pretty face. Her performance is perfect. The sweet, innocent 1950s girl. Or is she really that innocent?This is a story which had to be worked out meticulously and it was. Any missteps unravel everything. But at heart it's still rather simple which makes the story, and the characters, so easy to embrace. Director Robert Zemeckis tied it all together brilliantly. The story, the characters, the actors...it was a perfect storm which came together to produce true movie magic. This is a movie which is not just enjoyed, it is beloved. And it should be. What's your favorite Back to the Future moment? Is it one that makes you laugh? One that makes you cheer? Or one that makes you want to get up and dance? Go, go! Go Johnny go! Yeah, even the music in this movie is perfect as Marty desperately tries to get back to 1985. Ah yes, 1985, that glorious moment in time where if you wanted to put a really cool rock star in your movie you went out and got Huey Lewis. Everybody, Huey included, plays their part in this glorious movie. By the time the end comes, with one of the greatest closing lines in movie history because this movie is perfect right to the end, you want to stand and cheer. No matter how many times you've seen it. No matter if you're all by yourself in your living room. Stand. Cheer. You know you want to. And this movie deserves it.",Back to the Future

149,sharky_55,This is heavy.,8,18 January 2016,"Time travel is a tricky subject in films. There's the old dilemma of all the paradoxes of timelines and butterfly effects and the awkward problem of trying to create conflict where the previous events have already established a status quo. Back to the Future neatly sidesteps this problem and presents an energetic mishmash of genres that became an instant hit and spawned an eager following. The script's building blocks pull together the plot intricately. Every little hint, every anecdote and appearance from the current timeline (Goldie Wilson's re-election van, the lighting struck clocktower) is re-enacted through the time machine back in 1955. You can only imagine the delight of audience at first seeing a young George McFly being subject to the same treatment, and recognising the fateful accident of the car hitting the young boy and gasp at how suddenly, the future is being morphed. And so we have a intriguing premise established so elegantly. Even now the opening sequence is brilliant. We have this rather cryptic voice message from what seems like an eccentric madman scientist about the big experiment, the news report just as the camera reveals the case of stolen plutonium, and true to the key theme, an immense collection of clocks that tick so irregularly and mysteriously. Michael J Fox sees all this, doesn't make too much of it, and then we zoom out to the enormous amplifier that seems to be fit for only one thing in his mind: a guitar solo. He's a rockstar, and as he skateboards through the town to the very appropriate Power of Love, presents us with so many clues and landmarks that we will later look for in the same place, but decades earlier.The opening sequence also does a lot of the lifting that creates the intrigue until we finally reveal Doc Brown and his crazy experiment. The iconic Delorean descending from the billowing smoke is epic, and so is the first attempt at hitting 88 miles an hour where the car flashes and disappears in a trail of fire. Zemeckis has become a household name for pioneering visual effects but it's the sort of low key work here that doesn't interfere with the excitement of the scientific breakthrough and lets our imaginations go wild (we see this again in the excellent world-building in the sequel). And in the ending, he hints just a little at the next adventure, and the sleek hover and fly off into the distance is short but sweet. There's also some inspired camera-work here and there. Cundey loves the dramatic crane up and reveals, and these work very effectively in the context of the narrative; the vast, undeveloped plains of Lyon Estate, and the triumphant sign of the fire trails after the lighting strike. Michael J Fox as the lead character is just perfect. His height adds an extra dimension to the heroism; Biff towers over him and it becomes something other than a physical confrontation (it would have been easy to write in the son beating up the bully for his father). He oozes cool - there's the impromptu moment where he creates the first skateboard and weaves in and out before dispatching the car of bullies, and a moment of pure cheesiness and romance which he turns into a rock and roll romp - but of course they haven't got to that musical period yet. And he's also capable of being less than all style - see the hilarious way in which he stumbles out of the Delorean and is mistaken for an alien and his ufo. Thompson's young Lorraine is also excellent; each lovestruck sigh and desiring murmur of the dreamboat Calvin Klein is adorable and reminds us that this is exactly how it happened, only with a different boy. The Oedipus angle of it all is handled well, and with humour (My name is Darth Vader) - it could have been creepy or uncomfortable, but Lorraine is sweet and the resolution is satisfying. There are little kinks here and there, and the Libyan terrorist shoot-out perhaps a little too goofy, but Back to the Future is a delight.",Back to the Future
150,Beta_Gallinger,A sci-fi adventure with plenty of excitement and a good number of laughs!,9,2 July 2007,"I first saw ""Back to the Future"" years ago, but it really didn't do much for me. I saw it again several years later, and don't recall thinking much of it during that viewing, either. However, after watching the highly acclaimed Robert Zemeckis movie again recently (this time a good few years after my last viewing, I believe), although I still can't exactly call it one of my favourite features, I now understand why it has such wide appeal! In 1985, Marty McFly is a teenager who is not exactly popular with his peers, but does have a girlfriend named Jennifer Parker. His best friend is Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, an oddball local scientist. One night, Marty meets Doc out in a parking lot, where he is to assist the scientist with his new invention, a time machine made by a car! To make the machine powerful enough, Doc has used plutonium, which he got from a terrorist group who were expecting him to make a bomb with it! Unfortunately, just as Doc is about to travel through time, the terrorists track him down and shoot him! They then go after Marty, who manages get away in Doc's machine, but ends up being transported to the year 1955, back when his parents were around his age! Eventually, he meets the Doc of that time and manages to figure out a way to get back to 1985 with his assistance. However, Marty also learns that he has altered history, and must somehow get his parents together in order to save his very existence! This movie may start out a tad sluggish, but for the vast majority of the approximate two hours that it runs for, it is consistently entertaining! Most of ""Back to the Future"" is very exciting, with a lot of action, and it also works reasonably well as a comedy, with quite a few laughs here and there. Basically, the main cast members all nothing less than reasonable in their performances (I haven't noticed any really bad ones during any of my several viewings). The most notable performance (one that's definitely MORE than reasonable) is that of Christopher Lloyd, who fits the role of Doc Brown very well. The movie wouldn't quite be the same without this character and his antics! For all those reasons, this first installment in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy is one fine accomplishment! Over two decades after the release of this sci-fi comedy, it remains extremely popular. It's current position in the IMDb Top 250 is obviously proof of that. No movie can please 100% of its viewers, but clearly, the majority of people who have seen ""Back to the Future"" at any point in the past 22 years have enjoyed it, and that's a lot of people, so the film deserves a lot of credit! If you usually like to see the sci-fi and comedy genres combined, and you haven't seen this particular combination of the two for any reason, I strongly suggest you watch it as soon as possible!",Back to the Future
151,vip_ebriega,Time hasn't aged it.,9,12 May 2008,"My Take: A modern classic sci-fi comedy.Still stands out as one of the most creative and funny comedies of all time, as well as a creative piece of science fiction, BACK TO THE FUTURE is fun, funny as well as fast-paced and very entertaining. Greatly contributing from a clever screenplay and playful yet professional handling by director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg, BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic of its kind, and I think it's also one of a kind.The special effects have surely dated a bit, considering that the pattern for effects have advanced through the years. But they're still a lot of elaborate fun. Besides, perhaps the real ""special effect"" of the film is the clever screenplay. Written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, the script has dozens of very clever and ingenious ideas. The entire concept explanation of time travel remains original and brilliant until now, even providing some inspiration for other time-travel films 'ala BLAST FROM THE PAST.Michael J. Fox plays the teenage Marty McFly, who is accidentally whisked back in the year 1955 when he hops aboard a time-traveling Delorean created by the near-mad Dr. E. Brown, or simply Doc (played hilariously by Christopher Lloyd). Once there, he gets into trouble with his would-be parents, still teenagers, when her would-be mother (Lea Thompson) falls in love with him, instead of his would-be father (Crispin Glover), which sets the film's hilarious comedy with a difference.Despite some occasionally bad language, BACK TO THE FUTURE is perfect family entertainment, and I think it still is. It's fun and original, something that most recent, more expensive blockbusters can't do at the same time. And unlike most films that it could have been, BACK TO THE FUTURE doesn't get bogged down to a pure special effects exhibition. The film has a lot of fun with its actors and script, and values them as much as any million dollar effects thrown in. For those, very few, who haven't seen it, don't afford to miss it! Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",Back to the Future
152,PartialMovieViewer,A Good Enjoyable 80's Romp,9,30 January 2017,"This is definitely a sit-back-and-enjoy kind of movie – sadly a rare animal now-a-days. I have always liked Michael J. Fox, and he did a real bang up job in this film. How can you not like Marty McFly? It does tear my heart out that he suffering the way is. I am always impressed with the talent of Crispin Glover. As versatile as this person is, I see him and all I can think of is his performance in 'River's Edge' – brrrrr – more of them willys running up and down my spine. I guess the actor who grabbed me most (and probably most movie-goers), has to be Christopher Lloyd. I mean, who doesn't want DeLorean with the all-powerful Flux Capacitor. The pace of this movie is fast and the writing has a solid plot. Overall, I would say this was one of my favorites. Granted, I latched on to other productions as 'favorite' but this is still a very watchable and enjoyable 80's romp. I do miss movies made for the customer or audience and not for some performers' political projects. If you haven't seen, you may enjoy it. Try itI liked it.",Back to the Future
153,Stampsfightclub,Science and time travel has never been more fun,9,5 November 2009,"Marty McFly (Fox) is sent back in time to the year 1955 where he must make sure his parents meet and fall in love, otherwise his existence is in danger.This renowned Oscar winning sci-fi has everything you need for a entertaining viewing, whether with family or a quiet solo night in. Action, comedy and adventure this ticks all the right boxes and is a film we can look at and say is a fine depiction of time travelling mischief and bravery.There have been numerous films to attempt to unravel the complexity of time travel. From The Terminator to the Butterfly effect we have robots and unexplained seizures telling a theory on how travelling through the void can happen.In this 1985 release the complexity of the lexis is weighed down to a comedy level to fit the mood of the moment, and through the wonderfully buoyant Emmet Brown we see his theory of the flux-capacitor and the use of plutonium to achieve the unachievable is brilliant appreciation of the target audience. There is no over the top scientific knowledge as we take Dr Brown as he is an overly knowledgeable protagonist, and doesn't Christopher Lloyd do well? The star shows a very eccentric style to portray a subtle madness and delicious exuberance to deliver one wonderful mad scientist that gives the film, and trilogy, its main source of comedy and resourcefulness.Lets not forget Michael J Fox in arguably his most profound role from his illustrious career as the unbelievably cool teen who gets wrapped up in events. Fox's appreciation for cool is never over the top and fits even today's modern teenage stereotype. But to associate him with today would be unfair. He is way too cool for any kind of label. He skateboards, he has an attractive girlfriend, he plays the guitar and drinks Pepsi, what more can you say? He is the coolest kid in time.Whilst the plot is easy to enjoy and relaxing unconditional fun there is a level of importance of attention to be maintained as the plot's intention of science bases itself on a few key rules. Such as what can alter the future, saying the wrong thing and the difference from the present and the future. All run however thoroughly and with plenty of zest and humour to satisfy any viewer's entertainment requirements.The opening sequence with the clocks is fantastic panning and good timing (no pun intended) as Marty enters and blasts the stereo. This sets the tone for the coolness of the main character and builds everything around the complexity of time.This really is fantastic fun with wonderful characters and a springy adventurous minded script that never hinders on the past, not literally obviously. Parts II and III are well balanced fun, but this was where it all started and what a fantastic beginning it was",Back to the Future
154,khanbaliq2,"Back To The Future accelerates with wit, ideas, and infectious, wide-eyed wonder.",9,27 April 2010,"I wasn't excited to review Back To The Future because it has become a very popular film, but, after watching it again, I took out my pen and some recycled paper to get it over with. Before writing my review, I read and watched a number of materials about the making of the film. In my opinion, Back To The Future is one of the best science fiction films, even if it is a product of a big Hollywood studio (in this case Universal Pictures). It's one of the founding films in the special effects action blockbuster genre, though few of its successors have half its wit, charm or grace. The entertainment industry now realizes how important it is, and, therefore, the film has been promoted in the media and at conventions. But that's fine. I like it too. So, why do many people like Back To The Future? Firstly, it's an entertaining science fiction comedy. Secondly, its message of changing one's life for the better with a courageous act appeals to the masses. Thirdly, it's a well-cast and well-made 1980s movie. Back To The Future is simply pleasant to watch. Americans can watch it and be reminded of better times - the 1980s and especially the 1950s. Robert Zemeckis directed two good films before Back To The Future - the comedies Used Cars (1980) and Romancing The Stone (1984). In Back To The Future, Zemeckis demonstrated his technological savvy and attention to detail. The DeLorean DMC-12 time machine looks fantastic. The car was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable. When it comes to the excellent cast, the friendship of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) works very well. It's entirely believable, and it works even better in the sequels - Back To The Future II (1989) and Back To The Future III (1990). The eager, likable Fox is actually good when it comes to the comedy. Also, his upbeat approach to his roles made him perfect for the part of Marty. Lloyd, as the irascible, sardonic Doc Brown, offers sterling support. Another excellent performance is by Crispin Glover as George McFly, the cowardly, nerdy father of Marty. In fact, Glover's performance may be the most effective in the film, and he's funny when it comes to George's nerdy mannerisms, such as his shaky hands. Lorraine Baines-McFly is actress Lea Thompson's most famous role. Zemeckis wanted her for the part after he saw her in The Wild Life (1984), opposite Eric Stoltz. Stoltz played the part of Marty before Zemeckis determined that he had been miscast. It turns out that Thompson is good at impressions. I found her body movements and facial expressions interesting as she played the somewhat shy 1950s teenager Lorraine. She's especially effective in the second half of the film. In addition to the lovely plot and perfect cast, Back To The Future features a wonderful music score by Alan Silvestri. The rock band Huey Lewis and the News provided two catchy songs - The Power of Love and Back in Time. So, there's a lot to like about the film. It's an appealing slice of bourgeois Americana. I have a few issues with its messages, but I definitely recommend it.",Back to the Future

Thats in fact, how Bob Gale, and Robert Zemeckis came up with this story.If you do end up watching this movie, believe me, you will love it. And you will end up watching the two sequels, also.

158,ivo-cobra8,A classic masterpiece the original the only best my favorite time travel film of all time,10,17 April 2017,"What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! """,Back to the Future
159,The_Movie_Cat,"""Make like a tree... and get outta here!""",7,27 August 2000,"I always regard the eighties as the weakest decade for movies. Short running times were filled out with one dimensional characters and thin plots, patronising audiences with their banality. Some thought John Hughes was a genius, and everyone liked Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thankfully, there were the occasional gems in the mire, and Back to the Future – a family film with daring themes of incest and attempted rape – is one of them.Michael J.Fox is excellent as Marty, though you can't help thinking someone as boyish and short could never really be so cool. And I always thought it was irresponsible for a film to show such potentially fatal activities as skateboarding on the back of vehicles. Then again, how sensible can you be when your main songs are by Huey Lewis and the News?Still, eighties haircuts and braces as fashion statements not withstanding, this film holds up remarkably well. The heavily signposted coincidences and plot developments are fun, while the support work well, particularly Crispin Glover as Marty's dad. A number of ""blink and you'll miss it"" pieces add to the enjoyment, especially an advert on the back of a newspaper Marty picks up – which can only be seen clearly via freeze-frame – proclaiming: ""You'll be noticed driving the car of the future"".Direction could occasionally afford to be a little more cinematic in its approach (note how Marty films the Doc's experiment on a camcorder but we never see the camera's perspective; possibly because it's an obviously fake camera with no recording light) but generally it's sound. Christopher Lloyd's overacting could also grow irritating for some. Evidence of mild product placement does not really hinder the piece, and the evocation of 50's Middle America is quite charming.Maybe there's the nagging feeling that – now fifteen years old – the film's cultural parodies seem hopelessly naive in their application. Constant references to Star Wars, Ronald Reagan and Jackie Gleason don't seem as fresh or relevant as they once did. Back to the Future is an okay film, and an amusing diversion. But its lack of realistic characterisation and mainstream trappings make it an entertaining pile of fluff, nothing more.",Back to the Future
160,gab-14712,Robert Zemeckis's Time-Travel Masterpiece!,9,20 June 2020,"If you were having discussions about what is the most popular film from the 1980's, I can guarantee that 1985's massively popular Back to the Future will be one of the names floated around. Not only was it a massive hit with critics and audiences alike, I absolutely adore the movie. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Romancing the Stone) and executive produced by Steven Spielberg, this film is a near-perfect blend of science-fiction, comedy, romance, and action. It is also one of those rare films that children and adults will love. I fell in love with the movie as a wee child, and my father loves this movie himself. Maybe it is the intense charm and chemistry of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, or the excellent set design of what the town looks like in 1955, or perhaps that famous Johnny B. Goode scene-but whatever it is, this movie never grows old no matter how many times you watch it.Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale came up with this film's idea around 1980. It was floated around many studios, but they refused because they considered it too ""family-friendly."" Films like Fast Times at Ridgemont High were all the rage because of the new, more risqué way they delivered teenage films. After the box-office success of Romancing the Stone, Zemeckis now had the clout to get this film made. He teamed up with Spielberg, who also produced The Goonies, to get this film made. Zemeckis's screenplay was considered controversial and actually was refused by Disney because there was a scene where Marty McFly's mother had the ""hots"" for her son, but in different time periods of course. After all, Disney had its family-friendly image to protect. Luckily, Universal came to the rescue!The behind-the-scenes casting stories are well-known. Michael J. Fox was their first choice, but was committed to the popular television show, Family Ties. The producers were forced to look elsewhere, and they settled on Eric Stoltz. After several weeks of shooting, Zemeckis realized Stoltz was dreadfully miscast. His performance was too dramatic. Luckily, Fox had an opening in his schedule and signed up to do the movie. He was able to inject his own personality into the role of Marty McFly. Great Scott!It is the year 1985. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a skateboard-loving, guitar-playing teenager. One morning, he and his doggy companion go to Dr. Emmett Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) laboratory to play with an amplifier. He gets the call to meet the doctor at the empty parking lot of a local shopping mall where he confesses he discovered time travel...and his DeLorean is the time machine. Before Doc Brown can show off his discovery, he gets gunned down by some Libyan nationals. McFly barely escapes and only does so using the DeLorean...and ends up in 1955. He meets the younger versions of both his parents, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover). The problem is Marty interrupts their first meeting, which drastically changes the future. Marty needs to find the younger Doc Brown to help him set things right.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd show an amazing amount of chemistry with each other, and each of their individual performances are nothing short of fantastic. Fox really had a fun time and ""fun"" is the key word. He exhibited himself in Marty McFly. Lloyd is well known for his one-liners such as the constant use of ""Great Scott!"" and his wide eyes as well. Thompson and Glover also deliver in their performances. Finally, I really loved Thomas F. Wilson's best performance as Biff Tannen, the film's main antagonist. Gale mentioned that Tannen was modeled after Donald Trump, and yes I can see that comparison.In terms of special effects, they really hold up by today's standards. The visual effects team worked many, many hours to make the film look realistic as possible. The scenes with the DeLorean still blow me away. Or the ending scenes with the lightning and the tower...just fantastic. If you like musical scores, then you shall instantly recognize Alan Silvestri's renowned score. The theme is one of the most hummable ones out there. Spielberg actually disliked Silvestri's score in Romancing with the Stone, so Zemeckis told the composer to be grand. And we cannot talk about Back to the Future without Huey Lewis and the News. ""The Power of Love"" is one of the most popular songs out there no thanks to this movie.Back to the Future had many running jokes, most of which worked. When the DeLorean is mistaken as a flying saucer in the farmer's shed or people in the diner believing that Marty's vest is a life preserver is just several examples. Or I love to see how Marty's town looks different thirty years earlier. Anyhow, this movie is so much fun. It's a science-fiction movie, but it has enough humanity to it where it receives comparisons to It's A Wonderful Life. Robert Zemeckis went on to have an excellent career, but this is his masterpiece. It is a film for all ages. An unforgettable picture that knows how to have fun.My Grade: A",Back to the Future
161,SmileysWorld,As close as you can get to a perfect movie,10,16 September 2001,"I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B.

162,bankofmarquis,Almost a perfect film,10,30 March 2018,"I was flipping channels the other day and ran across BACK TO THE FUTURE, it was just about to start and since I hadn't seen it in quite awhile, I figured I'd catch the first part of it before venturing off to other surfing opportunities. As often happens in this sort of situation, I ended up transfixed by this film and watched the whole thing. After it was over, I asked myself why did I enjoy this film so much and my answer was fascinating (at least to me) -BACK TO THE FUTURE is about as perfect of a film as there is.Why? Let's start with the structure of this film. It follows the classic 3 Act structure. ACT 1: set up the premise, the gimmick (if any) and the stakes. ACT 2: escalate the stakes and throw in complications and obstacles. ACT 3: Resolve everything.Seems like a pretty simple formula, right? So why do so many get it wrong? Quite simply, they don't keep it simple and then execute (almost to perfection) the simplicity of the structure. Let's break down the 3 Acts of BACK TO THE FUTURE.ACT 1 - set up the premise, the gimmick and the stakes. The premise & gimmick is simple, time travel is possible and our hero travels back in time and is stranded there. The stakes are even simpler - our hero must find a way to get Back to the Future.ACT 2 - escalate the stakes and throw in complicaitons and obstacles. The stakes are escalated by the fact that our hero interrupts the timeline of when his mother met his father, thus there is the very real possibility that he will cease to exist for his parents never met. Our hero must find a way to bring his mother and father together. The complications are that his parents are not the boring old fuddy-duddy's that our hero thought they were, his father is a peeping-Tom nerd and his mother is a randy high-schooler who falls in love (lust?) with our hero, her son. Further complicating things is that the time machine must find enough power to make the time travel device (the flux-capacitor!) work, power that is not readily available in this timeline. Adding one more complication to the mix is the school bully who is constantly after our hero.ACT 3 - resolve everything. This is where this film excels. EVERY loose end is tied up. Our hero find a way to reunite his mother and father, the bully is put in his place, a source of energy is found and our hero's journey comes to a succesful conclusion.There is much, much more to this film than those plot points, but I just wanted to show how deceptively simple and efficient this plot is. Kudo's must go out to screenwriter's Robert Zemeckis (more on him later) and Bob Gale for coming up with this idea and executing it so well. Gale (1941, KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER) said he came up with this idea when he saw his father's high school yearbook and dreamed about going back to meet him. He stated that he doubted that he and his father would have been friends.An interesting side fact: The University of Southern California Film school's writing classes use the screenplay for Back to the Future as the model of ""The Perfect Screenplay"". So, I rest my case.But a ""perfect"" screenplay would be worthless without near perfect execution of putting the words and actions up on the screen - and this film achieves that as well. Director (and co-screenwriter) Robert Zemeckis (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, FORREST GUMP) cleary had a vision of how to make this film and did not waiver from it. The action is strong, the fluidness of the film is solid and the performances are all top-notch. The only thing that might knock this film down a peg or two is some of the 32 ""special effects"" shots that - to look at it these days - seem somewhat archaic (see the flames between Doc Brown's and Marty's feet when the DeLorean first goes forward in time). But for the time, these special effects are state-of-the-art.Speaking of performances, Michael J. Fox became a movie star with this film, and rightfully so. His Marty McFly is charming, quirky, intelligent, dorky - all at the same time. His uncomfortableness with his teen age mother is palatable. Credit must go with Director Zemeckis, who - after he couldn't get Fox released from his contract on the TV show FAMILY TIES - went (famously) with his 2nd choice, Eric Stoltz. When Stolt's seriousness and ""method"" acting was not meshing with the type of film he wanted to make, Zemeckis made the bold decision to fire Stoltz and worked out a deal where he can use Fox at night while Fox shot Family ties during the day. Playing against Fox, brilliantly, is Christopher Lloyd as ""Doc"" Emmit Brown. A two-time Emmy winner (at the time) for playing crazy Jim Ignatowski on the TV show TAXI, Lloyd played Doc Brown as ""part Einstein, part composer Leopold Stokowski"", creating what would be the benchmark for ""brilliant, scatter-brained scientist"". Leah Thompson does the finest performance of her career as Marty's mother and Crispin Glover was beyond quirky as Marty's nerd/loser Dad. Finally Thomas F. Wilson is the embodiment of bully as ""Biff"" Tannen.After the success of this film, two other BACK TO THE FUTURE films were made - films that I feel were good, but somewhat diluted the perfection of this film.

163,Angry_Arguer,The Lost Blockbuster,10,3 July 2003,"Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.

And the writers knew that, so they put in some dillemmas and suspenseful moments which rids the movie from any dull moments and keeps the audience's attention throughout.The two central roles of Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown played by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd respectively are so good! Memorable in every way even if their characterizations sound generic at first, they just play them out so well you can't dislike them.

166,fernandoschiavi,"Zemeckis and Gale to take us on an iconic journey through the 50s. Funny, clever, creative and very well produced, Back to the Future is a mandatory classic of the cinema!",8,11 July 2020,"The importance of ""Back to the Future"" in the science fiction genre in cinema is undeniable. Even though time travel was covered and gained great prominence in 1984, just a year earlier with the classic ""Terminator"", Robert Zemeckis' saga is innovative in several aspects, managing to become one of the best trilogies of all. times. The director was already reasonably known for some previous works, such as Youth Fever (1978) and Em Busca da Esmeralda Perdida (1984), which were far from critical and public success. In 1985, however, he would start to climb the post of a great director by launching Back to the Future, written by him in partnership with Bob Gale and produced by Steven Spielberg.There is perhaps no more fascinating subject in science fiction than time travel. The possibilities are endless. Go forward or back in time, see the future or the past. Is it possible to interfere in the past? What can this interference create? A parallel timeline? Immediate changes in the present? The paradoxes are exciting, with countless literary and audiovisual works addressing the theme in the most varied ways, with the most varied internal logics.Back to the Future manages to combine theoretical concepts about time travel with uncomplicated and uncompromised language that uses nostalgia as a strong binding element. The time travel that we see in Robert Zemeckis' impeccable work is a journey into ourselves, an internal conversation that, even without knowing it, we have every day.
The script by Gale and Zemeckis is extremely ingenious and does all this in a playful, light way, without relying on exaggerated, omnipresent special effects. It is an old-fashioned comedy with a touch of science fiction and not the other way around, managing to play with almost every possibility.Regarding the pace of the narrative, many comment that the film only begins when Marty McFly finally travels back in time after Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is shot by the terrorists from whom he stole plutonium to power the flow capacitor, MacGuffin from film that allows the miracle of time travel. Yes, without a doubt that Back to the Future really only works from that moment on. However, this is rather a prelude with an expository narrative that fulfills its function without causing yawns in the audience.
The construction of the text is millimetric. Notice the first image and the sound we hear. The ticking of hundreds of clocks in an irritating unison in a semi-abandoned laboratory. Marty walks in unceremoniously, establishing his intimacy with who he hoped to find there in what he calls, just Doc. There are a huge number of gadgets that make the venue the live action version of Disney's Professor Sparrow's home. We understand the profession (or hobby) of someone we haven't even seen and their relationship with Marty. We learned then that Marty is an excited amateur guitarist (who wouldn't like that super amplifier?) And that he is a very backward student who moves around with a skateboard. We see the fictional Hill Valley in 1985 in detail when Marty goes wild to study: the clock tower, the restaurant, the square. We absorbed the layout of the place, which was millimetrically calculated to expose the maximum in the shortest possible time. Marty has a girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells), and parents shy and exploited by a local bully, giving the narrative a sense of ancient history.When Marty then jumped into the DeLorean - originally, the idea for the time machine was that of a refrigerator, which was discarded for reasons of motivating children and teenagers to lock themselves in their refrigerators in order to travel through time. So, the choice for the DeLorean DMC-12 model was almost obvious - it encapsulates the time machine and drives at 88 miles per hour, catapulting on November 5, 1955 (the date is emblematic because, as we also learned in this prologue, was the date that Doc invented the flow capacitor and that he uses only as an example of the system he presents to his friend / pupil), the film changes. The pace slows down and we start to relearn what we already know, only with a look from 30 years before. Little needs to be said thanks to the initial 15 or 20 minutes. We get it all faster than Marty - or Calvin Klein - does. He is in the past and has just ""saved"" his future father from being run over, and with that, his future mother falls in love with the son he does not yet have, not with the future husband. The temporal paradox comes to a boil and the viewer's head begins to seethe with possibilities. And who can help? Of course, the 1955 Doc, the same one who, on that exact and fateful day, invented the flow capacitor without even knowing what it was for. A typical crazy inventor who lives in isolation, but who is Marty's only hope to return to the future (or to the present - or, for us, at that moment, to the past ...).Another decisive factor for everything to work fully is the cast. Michael J. Fox has an innate empathy, a way of captivating the viewer that made him the perfect choice for the good people Marty McFly, that ordinary teenager mentioned at the beginning of this text. For the public to travel with Marty, they would have to like him unconditionally. And that happens through the great performance of the young actor. It helps that Michael J. Fox has a partner to match Christopher Lloyd. Doctor Brown is the figure who explains the whole plot to the viewer without boring him with obviously expository dialogues. He is a nutty figure, without a doubt, but a guy you can count on and trust. We still have great performances from the supporting cast. Lea Thompson gives the common dreamy girl an interesting dubiousness, showing that not always a carola lady may have been prudish in the past. Crispin Glover does well to transform his character, a cowardly young man into a person who finally defends himself, in one of the most captivating screenplays of the 1980s. And finally, Thomas F. Wilson lives the bully Biffy Tannen, a boy who puts himself in the McFly family's way longer than he should - a role that grows a lot during the trilogy.
Another character that has no life, but is very important, is Delorean. A mobile time machine, a different car that was not very successful there when it came out, but that gained new breath after the success of the film. Much of the charm of Back to the Future lies in its time machine with the cage doors and all its flashing buttons. Last (but not least), we have the very small town of Hill Valley. She is, like Bedford Falls (from Happiness Can't Buy), a film heritage. The changes she goes through in 30 years are undoubtedly responsible for several highlights of the film. Built in the back of Universal studios, it gains an impressive transformation. In 1955, clean, beautiful, orderly. Thirty years later, time is relentless. Dirt, graffiti, depredations. It is possible to notice the great care of art direction in the construction of that environment, which makes all the difference when comparing the ""two"" Hill Valley.Remembered at the time as a bold visual effects film, Back to the Future manages to keep itself well in the eyes of today's audiences - with rare exceptions, such as Marty's transparent hand during the rock concert in the third act. But it is not just effects that Robert Zemeckis offers us. The filmmaker commanded one of the coolest action sequences of that decade, with Dr. Brown desperately trying to get a lightning bolt to Delorean just in time to send Marty back to the future. All of it orchestrated with precise cuts, a perfect performance by Christopher Lloyd and the unforgettable theme song by Alan Silvestri. Speaking of music, the soundtrack has good songs created by Huey Lewis and the News, an inventive joke with Johnny B. Goode, with Marty creating rock, as well as lesser-known songs by Eric Clapton and Lindsey Buckingham. The theme song composed by Silvestri is unforgettable as it evokes ethereal aspects of science fiction at the same time, with beats typical of the 40s and 50s series.Back to the Future is one of those productions that just don't age. The feeling of fun and engagement provided by the film remains the same with each new one. This may explain the longevity and the affection that fans feel for this adventure. In addition to success with the public and critics, De Volta Para o Futuro caused - and still does - enormous cultural impact on the world. In 1985, skateboard culture was still in its infancy in the Western world, and the film played its role in spreading the sport (Marty McFly was an avid skater). In addition, the DeLorean brand was never the same after the work's debut in theaters. The DMC-12 model made history as a synonym for the time machine, making it virtually impossible to dissociate the brand and vehicle from the adventures of Doc. Emmett Brown and Marty McFly.At the end of the day, the ""time travel"" theme is a beautiful excuse for Zemeckis and Gale to take us on an iconic journey through the 50s that appeals to nostalgia even for those who have not lived through the era. And, perhaps, the most interesting thing is that, today, when we look back in time - another time travel? - We feel nostalgia for the 80's that generated this and so many other magnificent films. Back to the Future is, in short, a great film that must be seen several times. With each new revisited in the work, we ended up discovering a detail that went unnoticed. Giving rise to two quality sequences, in 1989 and 1990, this is a very fun adventure, which interferes with the viewer's imagination while sewing its plot with each element being in place at the end. A film that has entertained audiences for almost thirty years, showing that it has stood the test of time. For a production that has its main motto in time travel, this is an essential quality.",Back to the Future

170,TheNorthernMonkee,rare 80s joy,8,17 October 2005,"SPOILERS When you build a time machine, it just has to be a Deloren really. The corrupt car manufacturer's ultimate advert for his death trap vehicle, ""Back to the Future"" was your regular 1980s classic. Well written, entertaining to watch and with a killer soundtrack, it's a film which has managed to survive the test of time. Released midway through one of the most irrelevant decades in history, this Michael J Fox driven piece is great.When Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) creates a time machine, he's made his greatest, and most risky invention. Shot for stealing the plutonium power source, Brown's invention undertakes it's first major expedition with young Marty McFly (Fox) behind the wheel. Travelling back thirty years to the 1950s, Marty finds himself in his home town of Hill Valley and in the company of his lovestruck mother (Lea Thompson) and useless father (Crispin Glover). Destroying their entire relationship, Marty manages to completely screw up his entire future. Still, with no way to get home, and a school bully on the prowl, he's got all the time in the world to fix it.Perhaps the one set of films that Robert Zemeckis will ever be remembered for, ""Back to the Future"" and it's two sequels will forever be remembered as an entertaining piece of cinema. From the opening of the film where Fox glides around the fictional town of Hill Valley to the sound of Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"", you can tell what decade it is, and yet you continue to watch.It might be harsh to really slate the 1980s as much as we do, after all, we did get entertaining films like ""Ghostbusters"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Out"" and ""The Breakfast Club"", but for every one good film, there were so many dire productions. A bit like the current box office climate, you knew that the majority were a disappointing mess, but there would always turn up one rare beauty. ""Back to the Future"" is one of those.Led by some straight forward but solid performances, the film just has something about it. The witty notion of the hypocritical mother and her secret youth, that one magnificent scene where Michael J Fox performs ""Johnny B Goode"" at the school prom and Marvin Berry (Harry Waters Jnr) phones his cousin Chuck, all add together to leave you with a huge grin on your face. It's an icon for an age, and for once it makes you grateful for the decade.Robert Zemeckis has never really found the highs of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy (1994's ""Forrest Gump"" is his only other major success) since the final part was released in 1990. Ultimately though, there are worse positions to be in. A rare joy in an otherwise dire decade, this film and the continuing parts, was an entertaining piece of cinema which left you happy and content. It's perfect afternoon viewing, and the one surprise is that it isn't shown more often.",Back to the Future

176,Ben_Cheshire,The cleverest of the three.,10,21 May 2004,"Part I is certainly the cleverest of the three. A rip-snorter of a premise: Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back to 1955 in the time machine that his friend Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, in a zany, unforgettable, over-the-top performance that creates one of the best characters of all time) has built, and he accidentally interferes in the meeting of his parents, so that instead of his grandpa hitting his father (Crispin Glover in another over-the-top but crucial and memorable performance) with his car, he hits Marty instead. So instead of Marty's mother falling in love with his father, she falls in love with him! Controversial and awkward though it may be, you can't deny its greatness. The real aim of this, though, is not incest, its learning what his mother was really like in her youth, compared to how she tells it. Plus, it lends a certain urgency to what Marty must do to set back the course of time, which makes us need to watch till the end to see he does it: he must somehow make his parents meet and fall in love, or he won't be born!The second main quest in the movie is the technical problem of getting Marty back to the future: since in Part I the time machine runs on plutonium, and plutonium doesn't exist in 1955, they have to find some other way of generating the 1.21 gigawatts needed to get the car to 88 miles per hour and send it into time.The third main problem of the movie is that on the day when Marty got sent back in time, in 1985, Doc will be shot by Libyan terrorists for stealing their plutonium to run the time machine, unless Marty does something about it. A terrific feature of these movies are their climaxes: Part I is a terrific scene where Marty must hit the power line connected to the clock tower at 88 miles per hour at the precise moment lightening strikes it, involving a reference to a famous silent movie image, of Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock high on a building in Safety Last (1921).Back to the Future pulls a lot of old punches, uses a lot of traditional storytelling gags and devices that feel quite familiar, but its unabashed sense of fun, larger-than-life tone and ripsnorter premise make it the kind of movie you treasure and watch time and time again.",Back to the Future

Then ""Star Trek"" used up the premise in its TV episodes and films, and there was even that ""Time Tunnel"" TV series in the mid-sixties. One option was to do such a movie with humor, pointing out the potentially absurd ramifications of traveling to your own past. So the main character of Marty McFly (Fox) ends up meeting his own parents when they were his age. Though this is a relatively tame comedy as far as teenage comedies of the eighties, there is the risky Oedipal element of Marty's own mother having the hots for him. This concept is then tossed aside near the end when, in a rather lame scene, his mom stops her advances because she suddenly feels like she's kissing her own brother. Disney should've went with this after all - it's possibly the least offensive picture of the decade and probably also explains its huge popularity - everyone could enjoy it.What elevates this above the common film are a few things: Glover's performance as Marty's father, both in younger & older incarnations, is deliriously eccentric; where everyone else is kind of in TV-movie mode, he's off in his own zone and hard to forget. There's an energy to the entire story thrust (from director Zemeckis), helped by Fox, who always seems anxious about something. The concept of time travel itself gets a clever redux here; we find out you can actually change reality in the present by your actions in the past - there's no mention of creating a parallel universe, for example. The ending is pretty strong, throwing in an extra whammy when we think things are over and everything is back to exactly the way it was. And it's very entertaining to watch Marty explore the fifties - we see through his eyes - the culture shock and making various connections between the older and new decades is a nice routine. There were also a couple of wildly funny moments involving Marty dressed up as an alien from outer space.",Back to the Future
184,Maniac-9,Endless playback ability,10,8 March 2012,"Back to the Future is just one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen every time you flip by it when channel surfing you always stop on that channel and watch it again. I've probably seen this movie a 100 times since I was a kid but if I stop on HBO and its playing I just can't help but at least watch a few minutes of it before returning to my channel surfing.Michael J. Fox was the absolute best actor to choose to star in this movie, he has great screen presence that whenever he's on TV he grabs your attention. It's such a shame the health problems he has had that such great skills are going to waste.The movie has so many great lines that I still quote to this day.",Back to the Future

186,0w0,"No discernible humor, but an OK watch if you've never seen it",6,17 September 2020,"The movie starts out with a cool premise and slowly starts to explore that premise and everything is more-or-less fine until about half way through the movie, but that's where the movie starts to fall apart. Things like unrealistic decisions by the characters are plentiful all throughout the movie, which spoils the immersion quite a bit. The acting also isn't great and several scenes had me cringing at the voice lines. The implementation of time-travel and the 'butterfly effect' that the time-travel has which is shown in the movie is also flawed and unrealistic, though they undoubtedly chose this flawed version of time-travel in order to create some false drama and suspense, so I guess it can be somewhat excused. The movie also has little-to-no humor or comedy in it... I didn't laugh a single time throughout the entire movie, and it's not like comedy movies from the 1980's can't make me laugh, in-fact, I laughed several times at 'Good morning Vietnam' and 'Airplane!' and 'Police Academy' and 'Ghostbusters', so it's really just that 'Back to the Future' has no discernible comedy in it to be honest.So overall, it's a pretty sub-par Adventure film which lacks both comedy and realism, but is watchable if you've never watched it before. Avoid rewatching it though as it's simply not worth your time.",Back to the Future
187,Min111,A timeless adventure,10,4 February 2019,"I seen the movie (Back to the Future) more than a dozen times now. Now, I'm going to admit that I've gotten bored of the movie now because I viewed the movie on numerous occasions. This usually happens when you see the same movie again and again. I don't think I'd be seeing the movie ever again now because there are many other movies out there which I really want to see that I haven't seen, but I'm really glad I seen this movie as a kid though. Who hasn't seen this movie? Exactly! Everyone likes ""Back to the Future"". Just see how high the rating is for the movie on here though I think it should be more high. In fact, more than a 1,000,000 people rated the movie on here. The movie, though, (Back to the Future) is outstanding. It's one of the best ""adventure"" and ""science-fiction"" movies from the eighties. I wasn't even born when the movie came out. You get to see many characters (main) in ""Back to the Future"" such as Biff Tannen (a high school bully), Dave McFly (brother), Doc Brown (a mad scientist), George McFly (father), Jennifer Parker (girlfriend), Linda McFly (sister), Lorraine Baines McFly (mother), Marty McFly (teenager) and Mr Strickland (principal). And let's not forget that cute dog named Einstein (How can you forget about him?) who happens to be my favourite character in ""Back to the Future"". When people discuss about this movie, I'm pretty sure most will discuss about Doc Brown and Marty McFly, but they seem to be forgetting the little dog, Einstein, that seem to have started the adventure in the first place. I find the dog's name interesting though. We know about the scientist named Einstein, but it's Doc Brown who actually looks like Einstein. As a kid, I actually thought Doc Brown was Einstein. I don't like, though, the Hill Valley high school principal named Mr Strickland, but I'm amazed he still looks the same in 1955 and 1985. He hasn't aged one bit - I thought it was funny. ""Back to the Future"" is also a ""comedy"" movie. He's a man you won't like, and he's the man with no hair. Doc Brown also looks the same in 1955 and 1985. He hasn't aged either. You have to see the movie though. The other character I dislike is Biff Tannen. He's a big jerk. But Biff Tannen is the reason ""Back to the Future"" was fun to watch. I didn't think someone such as Dave McFly would work at a Burger King. When Marty McFly returned to 1985 from 1955, his brother rather has an office job now. He dressed smart if you see the movie through to the end. I like the DeLorean (sports car) time machine which must reach 88 mph (miles-per-hour) in order to travel through time. ""Back to the Future"" is a movie where a teenager named Marty McFly is sent back to the ""past"" in November 5th, 1955 after escaping from a group of terrorists. I really like the part where Marty McFly is hit by a car, and he wakes up to find his teenage mother, Lorraine Baines, watching over him. I liked his reaction when he saw how attractive or gorgeous his mother was in 1955. I also like how he has dinner with Lorraine's family. I also really liked the entire part where Marty McFly finds Doc Brown in 1955, and he'd tell him everything. Yes, he convinces Doc Brown that he's from the future. Lastly, I like the clock tower or courthouse which was struck by lightning on November 12th, 1955. Marty McFly needed that to happen, so he can return back to his ""future"" in 1985. I rate the movie (Back to the Future) ten/ten. A timeless adventure...",Back to the Future

190,RossRivero99,Zemeckis' best film since Forrest Gump,10,11 July 2014,"Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future is a very entertaining science fiction film of which is also pretty funny at times as well. The movie stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly a teenager who was sent 3 decades back into the past all the way from present day 1985 to early November 1955 in a vehicle that runs on plutonium that was invented by his friend Dr. Emmett Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd). But when he travels back in time and visits his mother's house at the time he was young he has a huge problem which is that his teenage mother is in love with him instead of his future father. Zemeckis really knows good visual effects, a film i consider the best science fiction movie from the 1980's sine executive producer Steven Spielberg's 1982 classic E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Not only that this works as a science fiction classic, it also works as a comedic family adventure. This movie is a huge sci-fi entertainment for the whole family to see.",Back to the Future

It withstood the test of time, it never seems outdated...it is so cleverly structured and developed that if anything else ever comes this close to it, there might be some slim chance in hell that movies will be somewhat entertaining.Whenever the theme music comes on the speakers, I crank it up.Wow...what can I say that is negative about it?

Marty McFly, with the aid of his mad scientist friend, is able to travel 30 years into the past, where he meets his parents when they were his age. He both prevents history from being changed and yet changes it for the better. A lot of the laughs comes from comparing the town in 1955 and 1985.

Michael J Fox was perfect for the part and all the cast and Christopher Lloyd is exceptional, creating one of those characters that you will always remember.

196,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10,7 April 2021,"The stage curtains open ...I was 16 when ""Back to the Future"" came out. One month after it was released to theaters, ""Teen Wolf"" also hit the big screen. That was a busy summer for Michael J. Fox, who starred in both films. One of my friends had gone to see them both and then reported that ""Teen Wolf"" was the best one of the two. So, I did what he did ... I watched them both as a double feature. After I had watched both films, I wondered what he was on, because ""Back to the Future"" was CLEARLY the best movie. And to this day, it remains one of my all-time favorites.Marty McFly (Fox) is your average 80's teen who dreams of someday making it big as a rock star, has a hot girlfriend, skateboards his way around town, and who has a close friendship with a bit of a madcap scientist named Emmett Brown (Christopher LLoyd), who he affectionately calls Doc. One night, Doc has Marty meet him at the parking lot of a mall where he unveils his latest project ... a DeLorean he has converted into a time machine. During a mishap, Marty is accidentally sent back to the year 1955 where he runs into his parents when they were his age. Now Marty faces the reality of being erased from existence, unless the 1955 Doc Brown can help him get back to the future.I absolutely loved this movie when I first saw it, and I still do today. To say that it is a classic would actually be an understatement, though it truly is. It is the essence of movie magic, and helped to influence countless people, having a large impact on future movies and future lives. It is still just as pertinent today as it was back then. The humor is matched only by it's excitement - and both were abundant. The special effects were great for their time, the cast was strong, and the music memorable.I can't recommend this movie enough. Some people comment on the relationship between Marty and his mother as a teen as being inappropriate - well, if that is all you got out of it, you missed the point completely. ""Back to the Future"" is viable and entertaining, and has its rightful place in the lore of film legends. This is a perfect 10 stars out of 10. If only they made movies like this today.",Back to the Future
197,oOoBarracuda,"Back to the Future, Finally.",7,11 January 2016,"I was definitely late to the party on this one. I missed out on watching this at anytime over the past 26 years of my life, and I also missed watching it during the anniversary event in October 2015. I believe the adage is ""better late than never"", I hope it is anyway. No matter how late I was to this film, I'm glad I watched it. Back to the Future was a wonderful tale of ingenuity, diligence, and retribution. Michael J. Fox teams up with Christopher Lloyd in a quest finish his greatest invention and freely travel the realms of time.Our story begins in 1985, as we are introduced to Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a quintessential American teenager, forever embarrassed of his parents and seeking independence. His friendship with the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is well- established as he is in tuned to the many experiments he is in the process of developing. When Doc is ready to unveil his creation, he asks Marty to meet him at the mall in the middle of the night. Shocked at Doc's explanation that he has uncovered the secret ingredient needed to power his time machine, Marty is intrigued. When a terrible accident takes place, Marty is accidentally send to November 12th, 1955 where his entire existence hangs in the balance, as he must be sure that his parents to-be meet and fall in love, in spite of the fact that his entry into the past has disrupted this. The audience accompanies Marty through a nostalgic look at life in the 50's, and all that Marty introduces to the past. Marty's trip culminates with a big finale that must spark him back to his present.No one talks about Back to the Future without mentioning the incredible on-screen chemistry between Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Despite their vast differences in age, they pull off a believable well-established friendship beautifully on-screen. Several scenes throughout involve just the two of them, a type of movie in which chemistry is crucial. Another bright spot of the film is the shooting. With many special effects, especially in the climax, it needs to be believable or the story would fall apart. Robert Zemeckis obviously directs a beauty with Back to the Future and is a joy for audiences from beginning to end.A powerful message emerges as one watches Back to the Future. Many of the film's leads at one point has their character questioned. At the beginning of the film we meet George McFly (Crispin Glover), who doesn't look like he's strayed far from the 1950's even in the 80's. He is getting pushed around in the film, like he has all of his life, and seems to be destined for a life filled with this type of abuse. He seems to have no respect from his family members, or anyone else that comes into contact with him. Marty shows us, through his journey that sometime all it takes to make someone realize they deserve better is a little confidence from a friend. We also learn early on in the film that Marty has a passion for music and a dream to pursue it. He gets a big chance to realize this musical dream at his parent's dance in the past. He convinces his dad to pursue his own writing dream when he visits him in 1955, and seeing his father's dream pan out, one can only assume Marty will take his own advice in the future. One can also take a lesson from Doc Brown's perseverance throughout the film. He is never appreciated for his ingenuity, and often thought of as crazy for pursuing his scientific endeavors. In spite of all this criticism, Doc presses on and remains steadfast in his scientific exploits. There is something in this film for everyone, and the audience is given enough tools to find whatever suits them.Now that I have finally seen Back to the Future, I can understand why it has remained such a staple for decades after its release. This story provides a feel good story of normal, good people overcoming the evils of other normal people. Not an overwhelming moral story to the point where it is cheesy and unbelievable, but one that tugs at this reviewer's heartstrings nonetheless. Back to the Future is a four star prize for me, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes to follow an engaging story with fun characters. One does not even have to be a fan of time travel movies, as I am not, to enjoy this film. I'm glad I finally gave this movie a chance, and I will probably be along for the whole series.",Back to the Future

205,FilmFanInTheHouse,We need to head back to the future and enjoy the fun all over again,8,12 June 2007,"Back to the Future (1985, Dir. Robert Zemeckis) Story The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back twenty years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence. This is the start of the successful 'Back to the Future' trilogy.Actors Thing important thing about this type of film is that you really need the right stars in order for the story to successfully work. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, the lead character in the movie. He sits the role well of a normal teenager. He can really see the expressions his face, especially when he forgets he's in the past where no one can remember him. Doc Emmett Brown is played by Christopher Lloyd who is probably the best character in the film. His mad movements and acting style, added to his crazy look really made him seem like an actual scientist, who is trying to actually create something beyond reality. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover portray the mother and father of Marty McFly. Something which isn't often in films today is the same actor playing both the teen and adult version of their character. They were very well cast for the role and the makeup in which they go through really makes them look older, without making it to obvious. All the characteristics remain intact when both young and old.Music The music in the film which is composed by Alan Silvestri includes a few memorable themes but not a huge amount. The theme for the film is quite impressive and is not over used. Its main use of the use is found the actions scenes. Apart from these select few examples, the score can be very quiet. It's really hard to think of a piece of the score which does not include the theme. There are also music from Huey Lewis and The News. These aren't used out of place and still fit in with what's happening on screen.Special Effects Many people see 'Back to the Future' as a special effects film, but this isn't really the case. There are very few special effects shots in the film, but what does appear is quite impressive. There are a mixture of shots which would fit in well with a film today. One shot for example, is when the car disappears and the fire appears along the road. This particular effect would look out of place today, but still is viewable and enjoyable. The final shot in the film, where the care rises in the air and flies towards the camera is a lot better, and it perfectly blends in with the sky and looks very realistic.Conclusion 'Back to the Future' is a wonderful and classic family film which as survived through so many years and still has the enjoyable factor needed to watch it. It's not too long and not too short, and a perfect family film too watch together or even on your own.""What happens to us in the future? Do we become @$$holes or something?""  Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox)",Back to the Future
206,CinematicInceptions,"Has some implausibilities, but is nonetheless amusing.",7,28 October 2016,"This is total conjecture, but I don't think that the story of this movie would hold up with modern audiences. Nowadays, we all find plot holes and reasons why certain parts of a story aren't true to life or human nature. Put Back to the Future under that kind of scrutiny, and I don't think it passes the test. I guess people just didn't watch movies that way back in the '80's. They didn't care that all of Marty's dreams magically came true at the end in Disney fashion; they just wanted to have a good laugh and have another thing to quote. This may be a very shallow view of the '80's, but the fact remains that audience expectations have changed drastically in the past 30 years. Even if you look at how the time travel element is handled in this and in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, compared to how it's used in Interstellar and X-Men: Days of Future Past, there are major differences.Regardless, it's easy to see why this became a classic and resonated with it's viewers. It has a fairly interesting plot, but is very easy to follow. It also has a lot of fun lines and exciting scenes. The use of setups and payoffs and callback devices is done very well. It may be a bit on the nose in displaying the similarities and differences from '85 to '55, but this fits with its identity as a comedy and saves the audience lots of confusion. The exposition in the beginning is also vital to nearly all of the ironic and humorous situations that payoff in the 1955 setting. However, all of the events discussed in 1985 all conveniently happened during the same week in 1955, which is hardly plausible. That aside, it is impressive that the writers were able to squeeze that much information into the first twenty minutes in such a way that it would be easy to recall.But what we care about most when watching a movie like this is whether it makes us laugh. Any comedy can be mostly excused for its plot holes if it succeeds in amusing the audience, and I would say that Back to the Future succeeds for the most part. It may not be gut-wrenchingly funny, but it is nonetheless amusing throughout. If nothing else, it is interesting to see how Marty interferes with his past and how he discovers just how unbelievably sad his parents' relationship is.This makes for a pretty good all-ages comedy. It's easy for even the youngest of viewers to understand. There's a bit of language and sexual tension, but all of the awkward scenes between Marty and his younger parents are done in such a way that the awkwardness is palpable without being raunchy or gross. There aren't any plot holes, per se, but there are a number of clichéd moments at the end and a few implausibilities in how the time travel works. Obviously, Marty's world wouldn't necessarily be better after his trip, and it's still quite possible that he wouldn't have been born or turned out the same way. But it keeps things simple and adds a nice little cherry on top. If you haven't seen this, just be aware that it is loved as a classic comedy and did not achieve its status by great execution. Certainly it is superior in many ways to other '80's comedies, but it might seem overrated to a modern viewer. Overall Rating: 8.2/10.",Back to the Future

209,jhaggardjr,One of my all-time favorites,10,29 December 2000,"""Back to the Future"" was one of my all-time favorite movies when I was a teenager. It's a funny, exciting sci-fi/fantasy/comedy that today is still perfect for all ages. Michael J. Fox stars in his best film role as a teenager in 1985 who goes back in time 30 years earlier to 1955 in a DeLorean time machine and in the process meets his parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) while they're teenagers. He also catches up with his mad scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd) who built the time machine and tries to help Fox find a way to get him back to the present day. Director Robert Zemeckis made ""Back to the Future"" a winning film all the way around. Fox is terrific here. So are Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. The writing (by Zemeckis and Bob Gale) is fresh and original, the directing outstanding, and the technical elements (ranging from the terrific production design to the rousing music score to the superb special effects) are dazzling. ""Back to the Future"" was a great '80s movie, and one of the decades biggest smash hits. Also a big asset, an awesome soundtrack featuring two great songs sung by Huey Lewis just for this movie (""Back in Time"" and the Oscar-nominated ""Power of Love""). The two sequels that followed simultaneously in 1989 and 1990 failed to live up to this one. In this trilogy, the original ""Back to the Future"" is the only one worth seeing.**** (out of four)",Back to the Future
210,nickenchuggets,The man who was never born,9,13 August 2021,"If you were born after 1980, chances are you have seen this movie at least once, and you probably love it. Even for audiences watching long after its hype has faded away, Back to the Future still manages to be an unforgettable (and funny) experience because of how original it is. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the movie follows a teenager named Marty (Michael J Fox) who is accidentally sent back in time to the mid 1950s, thus setting in motion a possible paradox which involves his parents never meeting each other. Of course this means Marty will no longer exist upon returning to the 1980s, so it's up to him to get his future parents into a relationship. I think it's safe to say this type of plot has been attempted only a handful of times before in motion picture history, and is one of the reasons why this movie is remembered so positively. Before his whole quest begins, Marty McFly is busy living out the average and mundane life of an 80s teenager in california. His father doesn't know how to stand up for himself, and is frequently bossed around by his colleague Biff. Marty's mother drinks incessantly, and Marty dreams of escaping this hopeless existence. Soon, Marty comes across a mad scientist named ""Doc"" Brown (Christoper Lloyd), and he showcases a time machine consisting of a DeLorean DMC car augmented with flux capacitors and plutonium. Brown opts to show Marty a demonstration of how the car works and punches in a date of 1955. Shortly after, Libyan terrorists sent by colonel Gaddafi show up unexpectedly and shoot Doc for stealing plutonium from them to power the car. Marty has no choice but to escape in the DeLorean, accidentally activating its time travel capability. Upon being sent back to 1955, Marty realizes he doesn't have enough fuel to get back to the 1980s. He decides to search around on foot and comes across an adolescent version of his father, only to find Biff has been bullying him since his school days. Marty's sole objective now is to somehow get his future parents, George and Lorraine, into a relationship so Marty will still exist 30 years from now. After sustaining a direct hit from a car at low speed, Marty is knocked out and Lorraine has to care for him. Later on, Marty comes across a younger version of Doc Brown and must let him know his life-threatening predicament. Although Brown says the only way to have enough electricity for time travel is getting struck by lightning, Marty luckily possesses a newspaper from the future that states a lightning storm is due to hit the area around the town's courthouse that night. Meanwhile, Lorraine's attraction to her future son continues to get stronger, which will cause a time paradox if George doesn't intervene soon. Marty somehow has to get George and Lorraine to go to the upcoming school dance together in a hurry, but Biff shows up and forces himself on her. George finally decides to make a change and punches him out, allowing him and his future wife to go to the dance unimpeded. After a particularly wild guitar performance by Marty playing Johnny B Goode (which wasn't even out at the time), he shows up at the courthouse when the storm is about to hit. The lightning strikes right as the DeLorean (with Marty inside) hits 88 mph, sending him back to 1985, but the car stops working right after. Marty returns back to the parking lot where Doc Brown first showed him the car, and shows up right as the Libyan terrorists are gunning him down. All seems lost, and it appears Marty's actions in the 50s have broken the consistency of space and time, but Doc reveals he's wearing a bulletproof vest. The next day, Marty finds out everything is right with the world. His father is an accomplished writer, his mother doesn't drink anymore, and Biff is now George's servant. At the end, Doc shows up in the DeLorean and tells Marty to come with him to the year 2015. Back to the Future is undoubtedly one of the 80's most remarkable films, and once you have seen it, it's clear why it has left such an impression on the millions who have done so already. There are many reasons why this movie is impressive even almost 40 years later, but I think the majority of it stems from how it tries to connect the older culture of the US with the new. When Marty is talking to his past relatives about sightseeing on JFK Avenue, one replies ""Who the hell is John F Kennedy?"" Another ironic moment comes when Marty encounters the young version of Doc Brown, and Doc doesn't believe he is really from the future. He asks him to prove his claims by telling him who the american president is as of 1985, and Marty answers Ronald Reagan. Doc Brown still doesn't believe it, saying how a hollywood actor would never be elected. Those are just two instances. There's tons of things like that in this movie. It also sometimes works to the detriment of the experience, such as when Marty is playing Chuck Berry at the school dance and kicks over an amplifier. The amp makes a reverb noise, which amps weren't capable of producing until the early 1960s. There's another part where you can clearly see disability signs on the roads, when these weren't around until the 1970s. Of course, the film makers couldn't get absolutely everything perfect, and that's understandable. These things are still there if you pay attention though. It's also interesting to remind people how back in the 80s, there was concern that this movie wouldn't even be popular since it wasn't indecent enough. This is a strange criticism considering how the film contains allusions to racism, rape, and most prominently, Marty's mother being incestuously attracted to him before he's even born. All this aside, Back to the Future has stood the test of time (pun intended) as not just one of the 80's best movies, but one of the best movies, period. Zemeckis has said he will not allow anyone to remake any of the 3 movies, and this was a very reassuring thing to hear.",Back to the Future
211,baileycrawly,What's Not to Love?,9,13 July 2020,"I can't possibly understand how someone could not like the Back to the Future trilogy.The storyline behind this film is something that would've been very easy to botch in the process of transferring it from script to screen, and yet everything about this film works so well. It's extremely clever, endlessly funny and one of the most enjoyable films to watch. It held up extremely well over the years.Robert Zemeckis did a fantastic job in the director's chair, not only directing this film but also the other two in the trilogy, where he often does callbacks to this film in cleverly-done alternate angles of the same shots and, in some instances, alternate versions that are done so well they flow together harmoniously to create something that only ever improves the viewing experience.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd in the two leading roles are absolutely amazing working off each other. Without their chemistry, the film as a whole just wouldn't work, but they're both incredible, legendary actors who pull it off brilliantly.This is a rare occurrence where everything about the film, from the cameras to the actors, director, and score, just work. And everything comes together to give us this timeless cinematic gift that has been cherished since the day it came out and will be enjoyed for decades to come.",Back to the Future
212,mcfly-31,all time fave,9,24 August 1999,"July 3rd, 1985.  My all time fave is released and although I know most everybody knows about the film, I must recap it one more time.  Fox is Marty McFly, a cool, confident teen who plays a mean guitar, rides a skateboard like nobodys business, and has a sweet, pretty girlfriend.  One night in a mall parking lot his life is disrupted while helping his older friend, Dr. Brown (Lloyd, in a truly memorable performance).  The Doc is gunned down and Martys only escape from his own demise is to take off in Lloyds newly created time machine, an awesome looking DeLorean.  He ends up in 1955, when his parents were his age and oops, he interferes with their first meeting. And double oops, his mom has a crush on him!  Yuck!  The core of the film is his attempts to get them to fall for each other so that he'll exist in the future, while avoiding run-ins with a bully named Biff (what else?). The film is packed with one terrific scene after another; the skateboard chase, Johnny B. Goode, George standing up to Biff, the clocktower sequence, I could go on.  Two great songs from Huey Lewis and an exciting score from Alan Silvestri add to the films greatness.  Fox, replacing the fired Eric Stolz as Marty, is great, Lloyd is perfectly manic, Thompson is cute, Glover is a crack up, and Wilson's bully is right on target.  Two sequels followed, one in 89 one in 90, also an ok cartoon series and a lousy video game. Though most might not be with me that this is the best ever, youd be hard pressed to find anyone whod say this isnt one of the greats to come along.",Back to the Future
213,bsinc,An unforgettable experience,9,30 January 2002,"Let me just say this out loud - THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE FROM MY KID-HOOD!!! So cool, so different, so friggin' awesome. Marty Mcfly, one of the slickest, most energetic and entertaining characters ever brought to movie-life was forever Michael J. Fox's ""Christopher Reeve-Superman"" thing, but the price wasn't too high, he's simply irreplaceable in the trilogy. The exact same price-tag is also on Christopher Lloyd's Dr. Emmett Brown, Crispin Glover, and the guy who plays Biff. Don't even know his name, don't even care to, he's just 'Biff'.The music, the special effects, the sets, the Dolorean, heck the idea, and the acting-they're all impeccable. Impeccable. I still write all this after more than 14 years, but something that's usually stamped on Robert Zemeckis's movies is perfection to details and just about everything. Rarely does he fail at this, that's a consistence I admire about him a lot! ""Back To The Future"" is still one of his best movies, one of the best movies of the 80's, one of the best sci-fi movies, a true marble, after 20 years it's holding on without even a struggle, and is one of those eternal movies everybody who's into movies will see for sure.9/10 Recommendations: if you don't at least like it I don't believe you:)",Back to the Future
214,DavidSim240183,My all time favourite time travel movie.,10,9 January 2005,"I first saw Back to the Future a year ago. I couldn't believe I'd avoided seeing it for so long. It has to be one of the most enjoyable time travel stories ever put on the big screen, because it uses science fiction, and grounds the story in human emotion.Robert Zemeckis made a name for himself as a director with Back to the Future, because it was with this film he demonstrated how his storytelling can be likened to Frank Capra. In other words, he infused the intricacies of time travel with a benign, gentle touch, and with his own sensibilities too.Beginning in 1985, our tale centres around Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox). A typical teen of the 80's into skateboarding, rock n roll and girls, he is a young man who just wants to prove himself. He believes he can break the family curse common with all McFly's. Marty could actually amount to something.The rest of his family are really just a bunch of losers. Marty's father, George McFly, is the biggest loser going. He is an overgrown nerd who enjoys corny sitcoms and not much else. George has zero self-confidence, and allows himself to be antagonised, especially at the hands of his own personal tormentor Biff Tannen.Then there is Marty's mother Lorraine, who is an alcoholic, smokes, and looks older than she should. Its also clear she is in an unhappy marriage. Just look at her face when thinking about life with George. You really feel sorry for her.Marty's brother Dave is a pizza delivery boy, and his sister Linda must be the youngest old maid ever. Marty is really the only normal person in the family. The only bright spots in his life are his girlfriend Jennifer, and his friendship with the wacky inventor, Doc Brown (the brilliantly nutty Christopher Lloyd).Doc Brown is one of those eccentric kooks with a twinkle in their eye right out of a Jules Verne novel. One night, he needs Marty's help with his latest experiment. He has converted a DeLorean into a working time machine.Powered by plutonium, and at 88mph, it can literally travel through time in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, Libyan terrorists Doc double-crossed have caught up with him, and kill him. Marty avoids the same fate by jumping into the DeLorean, and accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past.1955 is completely alien to Marty, and an even bigger shock awaits him, when he meets his future parents who are still teenagers. Marty interferes with their first meeting, and puts his own existence in jeopardy. If George and Lorraine don't get together, Marty will never be born. And that's just one of the problems he has to contend with! Since the DeLorean runs on plutonium, and used it up when Marty made the trip to 1955, he is now stranded. Fortunately, with the help of the Doc Brown living in 1955, they hatch a plan to get Marty home. In one week, a lightning bolt will strike the Hill Valley clock tower. By using its power, it will generate the electricity the DeLorean needs to make the return trip to 1985.If all of this sounds complicated, it isn't. Back to the Future isn't nearly as complex as it sounds. It is wonderfully entertaining. Marty becomes George's best friend, and helps him find the confidence he needs to stand up to Biff. Marty playing matchmaker to his parents is not only fun to watch, but also amusing. Lorraine falls for Marty herself, which further complicates his agenda.Although I am not a big fan of Michael J. Fox, he was spot on as Marty. He brings the right amount of teenage rebellion to the role, as well as amazement at his situation. He also has a terrific chemistry with Christopher Lloyd.I can't imagine anyone else as Doc Brown. He is so zany, but so sincere. His hand gestures and body language are perfect, since he modelled his performance on the composer Leopold Stokowski. Every move he makes is always like addressing an audience.The idea of a DeLorean as a time machine was brilliant. It is great to look at, and also provides one of the best visual gags in the film. After Marty first arrives, the family who see the car mistake it for a flying saucer with its gull-wing doors.There are so many terrific scenes I could go on forever. Some of the most memorable are George standing up to Biff, George and Lorraine's first kiss, and Marty's attempt to return to 1985. You can't help rooting for George and Lorraine, because you really want them to get together. What is more satisfying, is because they meet under different circumstances, they become better people as a result.Marty playing Johnny B. Goode is great too, especially when he confounds the audience with their first taste of rock n roll. It really gets intense and gripping towards the end, because you don't know how things will turn out for Marty. The musical score by Alan Silvestri helps no end, which is so uplifting and exciting.Robert Zemeckis also showed his flair for special effects with Back to the Future. They hold up well after 20 years, and unlike most directors, Zemeckis incorporates them without overshadowing the characters.Back to the Future is by far the best of the trilogy, because of its simplified theme. Part II broke that rule, and was too complicated for its own good. Part III made a welcome return to the simplification that made Part I such a big hit.Back to the Future showed that science fiction can be used to promote humanistic values. Groundhog Day did the same thing for romantic comedies. There probably will never be a time travel story as compelling and heartwarming as Back to the Future.",Back to the Future
215,lagudafuad,they Don't come any better than this,8,28 December 2012,"Back to the future is one movie that contains excellent visual effects, a nice story plot and the directing is just excellent. The movie has a beautiful screenplay, and the movie puts the full stop in the statement, ""never a dull moment.""Michael J Fox was the desired man cast to play the lead role Marty McFly, but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, so Eric Soltz was cast in his place. After filming had begun, Zemeckis and Spielberg felt Soltz was not portraying the character well enough and knew this was a casting error, so they had to re-cast and ask Fox to try and make time to be in the movie. So Fox had to re-arrange his schedule time to be able to shoot Family Ties (TV Series) and the movie at the same time, this recasting meant, an extra 3 million production cost, as all the scenes that Eric had done had to be redone and Fox was so busy, that it was said that he only got 5 hours of sleep a day at the time.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager from the Eighties who befriends a slightly coco scientist Doctor Brown (Christopher Lloyd). During one of their meetings Doctor Brown mistakenly (due to an accident) sends Marty 30 years into the past, 1955 to be exact. Marty while in the past, mistakenly interrupts his parents meeting and he must find a way to fix it or else he will no longer exist. He also has to help the Doctor Brown of 1955 get him (Marty) Back to the future.Back to the Future was a financial success the movie's 100 days production cost was 19 million dollars (including the recasting cost) and it made over 380 million dollars in the box office. It was also a critical acclaim winning an Oscar for Best Sounding Editing.The balance in this movie is what makes it a most watch the movie's transgression from comic to science fiction to romance/drama, is what makes it such a most watch, it takes its time to explain even the complexity of time travel, that at the end even with the slightest of details that made no sense I actually was convinced and doubted not that Doctor Brown did it.Back to the Future is a movie hit for all to see and enjoy, it was that good that two sequels were added to it, Back to the Future II and Back to the Future III although the release dates for the sequels were 1989 and 1990 respectively all maintained the time of 1985 when the first time travel happened. So in the end of Back to the Future III, we were back in 1985.www.lagsreviews.com",Back to the Future
216,Cinemaniac1984,"30 years on, Back to the Future is still a timeless classic and a joy to watch.",10,22 December 2015,"Back to the Future is one of those movies with everlasting appeal that everybody loves to watch. Who would have thought when this was released 30 years ago back in 1985 that it would forever remain etched in everyone's memories and in movie history as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time. With its cleverly intelligent story and the perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, adventure, and romance, director Robert Zemeckis struck gold with this one of a kind movie that can never be duplicated. It also goes without saying that nobody can go past Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown. Mention any of those actors and without a doubt Back to the Future will always pop up as one of their most memorable movies.Back to the Future takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an aspiring musician who is dating Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and lives with his dysfunctional family. His weak willed father George McFly (Crispin Glover) is bullied mercilessly by his boss Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his mother Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) is an unhappy alcoholic. While she disapproves of Marty's relationship with Jennifer, Lorraine recounts how she met George when her father hit him with his car. On 26 October 1985, Marty meets his friend the eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in one of his most memorable roles) at a shopping mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. When the Libyan terrorists track down Doc Brown, Marty manages to escape however inadvertently finds himself transported back to 5 November 1955. Marty finds himself in a time where his parents George and Lorraine are teenagers and are yet to meet, Biff is still a bully, and Doc Brown is still developing the very early stages of a time displacement machine but is still the same eccentric scientist only 30 years younger. Not only must Marty find a way back to 1985, but he must also not tamper with history otherwise he may never be born.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are tailor made for their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown. Both of them will forever be remembered for this movie. They are just fantastic! Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have put in a lot of attention to detail with the comparisons between 1985 and 1955 as well as how the timeline may be affected for the McFly family and Hill Valley. With its quirky take on the time travel genre, the whole thing is cleverly written. The special effects for its era are top notch and Alan Silvestri's score is very memorable. Huey Lewis' theme song for the movie The Power of Love fits perfectly with the movie.I could go on forever how Back to the Future is one of the best movies of all time. What more can I say? 30 years on Back to the Future has not lost its timeless appeal and audiences everywhere get a thrill out of watching the movie. Even whenever people approach Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd the main topic of conversation will always relate to Back to the Future. Followed by two clever sequels, Back to the Future will still remain a timeless classic.A well deserved 10/10.",Back to the Future

221,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,29 January 2005,"Probably the best time-travel movie ever made, successful because it appeals to all ages- it has so much action and humour that all kids will be entertained, and the concept of time travelling is not dumbed down for the adults. The incredibly complex plot, made all the more incredible when considering that it spreads over the course of three films, but that each film has individuality.Michael J. Fox cemented his name in history by his performance here as school kid Marty McFly, a wannabe musician who befriends local wacky scientist Doc McCloud, played exceptionally be Christopher Lloyd. The Doc has created a time machine in the form of a De Lorean car. However, when the Doc is murdered, it is up to Marty to ravel back in time to prevent the murder. Marty goes back to the fifties- to the time when his mum and dad were in school together, but in a great twist Marty's mum falls for him, so he has to figure out how to get his mum and dad together or he will never be born. Many more twists ensue with frantic pace until Marty eventually attempts to get back to the future.The action is fast, the sets and costumes are excellent, the famous theme tune is rousing, and there are many memorable moments. It is definitely a film for fans of 80's nostalgia, but it is one of those rare films which can be clearly recognised as being made in the 80's without looking remotely cheesy. On the contrary, everything about the film remains cool to this day. Every performance is worthy of mentioning, from McFly's eternal bully Biff, to Marty's young, geeky father. A film which should delight everyone, and another which i find difficult to fault. 10 out of 10",Back to the Future

223,roghache,Zany and hilarious time travel tale,8,15 March 2006,"This is a great fun movie, the best of the time travel genre, other than the more serious Star Trek themes.It's the wild and zany tale of 17 year old Marty McFly (that can't be a real last name, surely?) who teams up with your typical mad scientist and inventor of time travel, Doc Brown, resulting in Marty going back in time to 1955 and maybe even preventing his parents from meeting. Obviously something to be avoided at all costs if you'd like to be born.The plot twists, quirks, and spins are too numerous to delve into here, but they'll keep you riveted to your seat and laughing your head off. The lead actors are both wonderful in their roles... the always incredible Michael J. Fox as Marty, and Christopher Lloyd suitably crazy as the crackpot time travel scientist. He ('the Doc', as Marty calls him) is just so wonderfully nutty and wacky, and what I most remember from this movie.

I'm not one to bash other people's opinions, no matter how much I disagree with them, but I can't understand how you can't like this movie. Maybe think it's overrated, but if you live on this planet, you should like this movie. It isn't my favorite movie of all time, but I can find more flaws in movie's I like more than this.Really, all I can do is nitpick the movie, like how Biff is more of a serial killer than a bully, but what would be the point, it would still just be nitpicking. So yes, it does have some small flaws, but that doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece.OK, the good stuff now, first, there is something in this movie for everyone. It has comedy, it has romance, it has science fiction, it's a high school movie, there isn't much action, but that skateboard chase is pretty awesome. So basically if you want any of those types of movies, you will get it with this film.The characters are so much fun, and very memorable. Marty is extremely likable, Doc is hilarious, Biff is such an asshole yet you still can't help but enjoy him, Lorraine is hot, and George has some great moments. And I love the story, time travel is one of those things that has been around for years and will never get old. Everything works, and I love the little background jokes it does, like how Marty meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, goes back, knocks down a tree, and comes back and it's the Lone Pine Mall.The special effects are great, it's funny as hell, and it's just a lot of fun to watch.

232,mOVIemAN56,A lot of fun,8,16 May 2007,"Back to the Future is the kind of film for all ages. I have not come across many people who find this film to be stupid. A variety of ages, when asked, have told me they love the concept of the film, the story, the characters, etc etc. I agree with them whole heartedly. Back to the Future is one of those films I can go back to (no pun intended) again and again. It is a film that doesn't need brains to figure out, just watch and you'll enjoy it.Back to the Future follows the life of Marty McFly and his relationship with a crazy old scientist, Dr. Brown, who says he has discovered the secret to time travel. Due to odd circumstances Marty is sent back in time and the time machine (which is actually a buffed up DeLorean) breaks down, stranding him in the time when his parents were in high school. With the help of the younger Dr. Brown he must figure out a way to save his own existence when he messes up things between his parents and find a way to get 'back to the future'. Michael J. Fox is a great actor. He captures the spirit of a teenager though he was 24 when he did the film. He is the initiator of most of the jokes, though they don't come from his mouth. His inability to realize that he is in the past makes several awkward moments in the past, especially with the local bully and at a school dance. His performance is legendary in my book and one of the reasons I watch Back to the Future so often.Christopher Lloyd, I feel, is what made this film work. His eccentricity and his random proclamation of ""Great Scott!"" makes his character work so well with what he is use to portraying. A veteran actor of Lloyd's background was needed to make the film work. If a serious actor had been put in the role, the film would not have worked. His odd approach to the character made his character and acting the funniest bit of all in the film.The portrayal of 50's life is right on par. Marty's interaction with it is some of the funniest things I saw in the film. Crispen Glover gives a solid performance as Marty's father back in the 50's. What I find great about the film though is how you feel for every character. You really do feel for George McFly (Glover) as he struggles to woe the love of his life Lorraine. A rarity in comedy indeed. You want Marty to get back to the 80's and you want Biff to get decked the whole film. The script is solid, the acting is superb, and the laughs are numerous.4/5 Stars",Back to the Future
233,nickmesafilms,Back to the Future (1985) - 1.21 Giggowatts! 88 Miles per Hour! Great Scott!,10,13 October 2011,"One of the most entertaining science fiction movies of all time, since ""E.T."" and ""Star Wars"". ""Back to the Future"" tells the story of Marty McFly, who accidentally gets transported into a time machine, built by a wacko-genius scientist named Dr. Emmett Brown, and accidentally gets sent into 1955, and interacts with his parents as teenagers. Know he must get his teen parents together before the space-time continuum can mean the end of the world, and he must get back home to 1985 quickly. Now, I'm a big fan of science fiction, and this movie is a gigantic time-travel masterpiece. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both lead an all-star cast with incredible and hilarious performances. The cast also includes the many great performances of Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and Crispin Glover. Robert Zemeckis does an amazing job of putting the movie together, and he joins Bob Gale in writing a well-written tribute to science fiction. The sound is super and superb, the visual effects are groundbreaking, the cast is incredible, the soundtrack is awesome, the score is amazing, the characters are well-memorable, and everything about this movie makes me wait for more, and I'm always entertained by this movie, even when watching over and over again. ""Back to the Future"" is science-fiction genius, and it's one of the many groundbreaking cinematic achievements in history.

234,Okonh0wp,**** Stars: Very underrated film,10,9 June 2004,"This is probably the most underrated trilogy of the 20th century, and in my personal opinion it's almost up there with Indiana Jones and Star Wars in terms of adventure and fun. It's perhaps the best science-fiction film, in terms of having widespread appeal while still being also appealing to those intrigued by the Time Travel angle. I do maintain, however, that this is at heart, a sci-fi film, maybe not in par with TV shows like Babylon 5 or Star Trek: The Next Generation in its complexity, but Doc and his time traveling contraption are really the movie's main draw, and furthermore, I think that the movie has enough scientific exploration within it, that it appeals to those scientifically-minded thinkers within ourselves.At the same time, it mixes the science up with comedy, action, and romance, and practically everything else, and that's why I think this practically everyone who's seen this has liked it.The ensemble gets a lot of mileage, just out of playing with type. Michael J Fox plays the epitome of the rebellious teenager of the 80s, Christopher Lloyd's mad scientist doc, who initiates the whole adventure, comes straight out of a comic-book, and just the same, it's probably the best performance of his career. Also, the protagonist's dad, George, and his nemesis Biff, are found in the standard nerd and bully roles. Adding to a great ensemble, this is just an all-around solid film, the special effects are great, the soundtrack (Alan Silvestri) is one of my favorites, and it's just, overall, a lot of fun.",Back to the Future
235,mmallon4,Spaceman From Pluto,10,21 October 2015,"An aura of 'cool' permeates everything about Back to the Future. I could imagine seeing this film when it came out in 1985 (of course I wasn't alive) and watching Marty McFly riding through Hill Valley on his skateboard while holding onto the back of a truck to The Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News and thinking to myself, ""omg, this is just the coolest film ever"". To me Marty McFly is the personification of cool, he rides skateboards, has a hot girlfriend, plays guitar. Yet his life is far from perfect; his dad is a dweb, his mum is an alcoholic and his uncle is in prison. This brings him down to a relatable level, plus he hangs out with a crazy old scientist. Why? I don't want to know. I like the mystery of not knowing how this unconventional friendship came to be. The technical jargon between Marty and Doc is a never-ending pleasure to listen and even lines which shouldn't be memorable are somehow highly quotable (""Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that it's 8:25...dam I'm late for school!""). Likewise taking the coolest looking, commercially available car and making that the time machine is yet another stroke of genius. Notice the scene in which we see the DeLorean for the first time; it's impossible for Doc Brown to get inside the DeLorean while it is inside the truck so he would have had to get into the car and drive it into the truck and just wait there until Marty would show up and then drive it out and exit the car. I guess Doc thought he had made a time machine that looked so badass he really had to give it an impressive introduction to Marty. The whole movie has the best uses of product placements I've seen in a film; never before have I been happier to see advertisements for Pepsi and Texaco. The pacing of Back to the Future is perfect, the film never lets up; the odds keep stacking up against Marty and the suspense towards the end of the film is crazy.Even though most of the film takes place in the 1950's, Back To The Future is the film which defines the 1980's. The ending in which Marty finds his family has been changed for the better and he gets the 4x4 vehicle he wanted; it's a wish fulfilment fantasy and very much a capitalist, 80's ideal. It's an uplifting ending, providing you ignore the fact that Marty now has to adjust to living with a family he has no previous memory off. It makes sense that Marty goes back to the year 1955, the time period of when adolescence had a voice and began an economic force for the first time in history; plus just take a look at the title of what won Best Picture that year. Marty's mother being attracted to her son is weirdly funny plus his mother being the opposite of her adult herself; makes you question your own parents claims about their day. I'm always struck by the moment when Marty tell his relatives in 1955 he has two TVs and they think he's joking yet if you told someone in 1985 that households today own upwards of 6-7 TVs, they would have the same reaction.Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Back To The Future; to me these are the trilogy of trilogies. The three film sagas I can watch again and again, always notice something new on each viewing, discussing every character to no end, coming up with crazy fan theories and trying to find an explanation to any possible plot hole. I'm sure there are still plenty of subtle gags, use of foreshadowing and who knows what lurked within this film which I still haven't noticed. Is it possible for a film to be 100% perfect, one which has absolutely nothing wrong with it no matter how minuscule? I can't think of another film (or series) which has a better use of repeating images and motifs. If I could only bring one DVD to a desert island, it would be my trilogy box set so I could spend my time uncovering every last secret in the trilogy. I love how self-contained the movies are; there are so closely connected to each other and the perfect film trilogy to watch in one go (as I have done several times).But what is it that makes Back to the Future immensely beloved by such a wide audience? I can tell you why I love it but I have a weird and eccentric film taste. Perhaps it's due to time travel is something we all fantasize about, as well as the idea of seeing your parents when they were young. The themes the film explores such as family, coming of age, the generation gap and the optimistic message of free will, that our future isn't written; it's whatever you make it.To Be Continued...",Back to the Future

I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen. Although there are some serious moments Back To The Future is lighthearted with non-stop fun From beginning to end,Back To The Future has an energy and flow that just never stops and keeps you glued to the screen with relentless pace and excitement that makes the film re-watchable and iconic to this very day. The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters. The SCI-FI scenes in BTTF involving the Delorean are so dazzling and are done with imagination and beauty that will make your jaw drop and it doesn't matter how many times you see BTTF you will be blown away by the Delorean sequences. There have been many classic movie duos throughout cinema and among the great duos are Marty and Doc. The scenes between Marty and Doc are truly funny with terrific back and forth banter and have some of the best scenes in the film that are unforgettable. While the two are different in personality and are separated by age the two have a friendship that feels genuine and real where you feel that Marty and Doc would have each other's back at all costs. The friendship between Marty and Doc is further cemented in Part II and III where you feel they will be friends forever whether it's in the future or in the present. Marty and Doc are two amazing and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. The ending of Back To The Future is terrific,thrilling and filled with surprises that will leave viewers laughing and smiling. A fantastic ending.The cast is wonderful. Michael J. Fox is excellent and funny as Marty McFly,with Fox bringing laughs and charisma to the role. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as Dr. Emmett Doc Brown,with Lloyd being delightfully over the top and having a fantastic chemistry with Fox. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are wonderful as Lorraine and George McFly,Marty's parents. Thomas F. Wilson is terrific and fun as Biff,a neighborhood bully. James Toklin is great as Mr. Strickland,a hard nosed principal.

His father was weak and incompetent. He had no other hobbies than watching TV and eating. And often bullied by his boss. Martin was also looked down upon by the teacher at school, because this teacher was also the teacher of his father George thirty years ago.The mother married her dad because of compassion. After marriage, she lived in fantasy and gradually became an alcoholic and obese woman.His older sister and older brother also lacked talent. His older brother worked as an ordinary worker, and his older sister was as bloated as her mother and lacked charm.But in such a family, Martin is a person with ideals and vitality.He played skateboarding fascinatingly, and organized his own band, self-innovated genre, he also became a year-end friend with a Frankenstein.It was Martin's maverick that changed the fate of this family.In an accidental experiment, he took a time machine made by a doctor back to thirty years ago. And met the parents of the year.And even more accidentally, he actually became the object of his mother's admiration instead of his father.If he cannot make his parents a lover at the time destined, he will disappear from the earth.Therefore, a series of actions to match his parents were put into practice, and in the process, with his continuous encouragement, his father George finally became brave, and finally won the heart of Martin's mother with his personality charm.Of course, the most interesting thing is at the end. When Martin overcomes many difficulties and returns to the future, everything in the family has changed.The elder brother became a senior clerk, his father was a famous writer, and his mother was a new type of woman of the times, and avant-garde.In the memory of everyone, there is no longer a past life.

The film has all the major genres drama, adventure, fantasy, and comedy. Boy was I right Back To The Future continues to get numerous broadcast on cable networks especially TBS, I have probably watched Back To The Future 100 times and I own a VHS copy. The reasons I find the film so entertaining are first the wonderful acting of Michael J. Fox and Lea Thompson, Michael J. Fox is always entertaining to watch due to his wit and comedic ability. Lea Thompson is eye catching she has underrated beauty. Second I first saw Back To The Future only by chance, I was going to see a minor league baseball game, but due to a rain storm that caused the game to be canceled me my father and uncle made a trip to the theater, despite being a couple of minutes late, we still watched a delightful movie. Hey just as in time travel things don't always go as planned. Hint: Back To The Future. Finally Back To The Future is a tribute to any history buff, if your like myself and enjoy the past it would be a dream come true to travel back in time, especially to see your parents fall in love, see the shape of a community and how it changed to the present, but to already know the outcomes. Finally you must have drama and conflict in the past so you can really enjoy your present state example: Marty's struggle to get his parents to meet and fall in love and to get back to the future, and remember you can't take the place of your father in the past it could be disastrous Quote: of Dr. Brown.

I mean, you have The Shining, Empire Strikes Back, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, and this. Now, I recently found out that I had Back To The Future for a long time, just never realized it. Actually, it is my Dad's, but still. Not only that, I found out that it came with Back to The Future Two and Three also. I of course watched this one first, and all of a sudden, I realized that I have seen it parodied thousands of times. I never knew how many different scenes that I have seen before were in this here film.Here is the plot. A teenager named Marty finds out that his friend named Emmet, or Doc, made a time machine. Then, Doc is gunned down by terrorists. Marty then goes into the time machine car and goes back to 1955, the year in which his mother and father get together. Then the car runs out of fuel. But do you what is even worse? Marty screws up time by accidentally making his mother like him, not his father. Marty then finds Doc, who is in 1955. Doc figures out how to get Marty back in time. He can use the lightning from the clock tower. Marty tries to get his mother to like his father.Then, Marty's mother asks him out for the dance. Marty and his father make a plan for his mother to like his father. The day of the dance the plan backfires horribly. The school bully Biff locks Marty in a car and attacks his mother. His father, named George, tries to rescue his mother, named Lorraine, but he was expecting Marty, not Biff. Then George knocks out Biff and Lorraine and George go to the dance together. Then Marty gets back to the future and realizes that the future is now better than is was. Turns out that Doc was not killed, but then Marty and his girlfriend need to got to 2015 with him.Overall, this is a terrific film. It is impossible not to love this film. There are very few films that could be as fun as Back to the Future.

245,luke-a-mcgowan,"Brilliant, creative and delightfully fun",10,5 November 2015,"Behold Robert Zemeckis' masterpiece, one of the best films ever to come out of the 1980s. One of the most brilliant and creative films I've ever seen, Back to the Future is an enduring classic.The star of the show is Marty McFly, played with utter brilliance by Michael J. Fox. Marty is a bit of a cool kid, but as played by Fox he's also a bit of a goof and he's hilarious to watch. In my opinion, McFly is the greatest movie protagonist of all time. He rattles off the incredible dialogue from Zemeckis and Bob Gale but also injects it with such authentic emphasis and ""ums"" and ""ahs"" that its so easy to watch without thinking that you are watching a performance. He has incredible chemistry with Doc Brown (the unparalleled Christopher Lloyd). Also making up the superb cast are Lea Thompson as Marty's mother, Crispin Glover as his father and Thomas F. Wilson as Biff (one of the greatest film bullies of all time, thanks to Wilson's intimidating yet incredibly funny performance).Alan Silvestri's iconic score is perfectly utilised to create a sense of triumph at key moments in the film. Zemeckis directs the hell out of the film with some superb long takes and superbly choreographed scenes. The film's climax is one of the most tense and brilliant scenes Zemeckis has ever made. But its the screenplay that makes the masterpiece - chock full of quotable dialogue, memorable characters and one of the most accessible time travel stories of all time. The story of Marty's parents is so much better now than I've ever realised; Lorraine's sheltered upbringing and George's timid persona set them up perfectly - their love story before Marty arrives is just as believable as their story as set by Marty, AND its just the right set of circumstances for his arrival to set it in jeopardy. It could have gone any way. Zemeckis and Gale place well written scenes in two different time periods to make a point more flawlessly than any amount of exposition ever could. There are some problems with the film - after George's triumphant victory in the car park, the film needs to put in one more obstacle for him to overcome (a red haired brat who is never seen before or after) which just feels like borrowing time (which was needed but could have been done better). But all you need to do is watch Michael J. Fox shred the guitar to Johnny Be Good and you'll be giving out a perfect rating just like I did.",Back to the Future

Good acting from everyone involved, and effects (the minor instances it's used). The entire prom sequence is just brilliant. It was a wise decision to take the story to the past, which saves a lot in special effects expenditure. I don't think I need to say more; it's a sci-fi classic now.Spoiler: It's sad but not paid attention to; no matter how his parents were, the parents he returns to aren't the same people who brought him up. Was he just happy to have this new enhanced version of them? Yes, getting rid of the bullying part was completely fine, and I agree that the new versions of them are much better. But the rest? The memories he had with them don't exist anymore. Anyway, that part isn't a big deal; maybe we aren't supposed to analyze that aspect so deeply. And why did it have to end in a cliffhanger?

But to this day, imagination still booms at the possibilities of traveling through space and time. To witness historic events. Or even see where our world is heading in the future. Pop quiz: How many films can you name in 30 seconds that deal with time travel? Quite a lot, right?! In 1985, along came Universal Studios.

Through a series of mishaps, Marty winds up back in the year 1955. Now, Marty's forced to track a much-younger Doc and convince the budding scientist to help him get back to 1985. Along the way, he's also bumped into his future-parents. Thus screwing up his own future. So now, he's got to find a way of getting his dad George (Crispin Glover) and mom Lorraine (Lea Thompson) to fall in love. But that's not going to be easy with the local bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), hanging around. The rest I'll leave for you to discover. It's an instant classic with eye-popping special effects and a stellar cast. Followed by two equally-strong sequels. So if you haven't seen the BTTF trilogy yet, what's stopping you?!",Back to the Future
249,stormhawk2021,An 80's sci-fi classic,10,28 June 2017,"I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time traveling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways.",Back to the Future

But I still love it. Michael J Fox is funny, but Christopher Lloys is even better than he was in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUUCKO'S NEST. It is a character both similar and un-similar to each other.

251,zac-04879,A Super-Entertaining 80s Comedy About Time Travel,8,12 July 2021,"Back to the Future will remain as a speedy-moving classic with unforgettably creative ideas that could not ever be executed more perfectly. No matter how many sequels, reboots and remakes are planned, they will never beat the excellent cast and diverting plot. Throughout the film there's a jolly handful of action-related, science-themed, comedy-connected, adventure-packed and romantic-linked plans that fit perfectly into the story (also making it more engaging and dramatic). But each actor and actress provides a necessary character to contribute to the tale.Michael J. Fox plays a young and bright teen desperate to find the way out of the past and back to his present time. Christopher Lloyd is the fuzzy and eye-catching scientist who assists Fox's character in travelling back to the future that he belongs in. Them and the other cast members are intelligently planned out characters, who end up making realistic sense with the story.An 80s classic like Back to the Future needs to be remembered and passed on as a scientific time-traveling comedy. It's a familiar favourite that's very entertaining and catchy. The whole plot, from the opening credits to the closing shot, is just pure magic and effects. The visual effects are amazing and only seem to get better as the world ages. It doesn't matter if you're a big fan of sci-fi stories or romance, the humour and how moving this film is will continue to exist as a familiar favourite for families with older kids.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Back to the Future
252,dimplet,Succeeds despite the over-acting,8,27 July 2011,"I see Back to the Future has grossed $350 million. I wonder how much it would have made if I had directed it?While Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd deliver impeccable performances, and it is impossible to imagine the movie without them, most of the rest of the acting is pretty bad, sometimes way, way over the top, such as the 1985 revised apologetic Biff. Anywhere else, audiences would have cringed. I cringe every time I see it.But you can't argue with success. Did the movie succeed because of the over-acting, or despite it? Perhaps teenagers were amused by the silliness. But for adults, the movie is strong enough that they seemingly overlook it.Back to the Future has many strengths, such as drawing you into the fantasy of what it would be like to travel back to the 1950s. There is enough detail and authenticity to the recreation that you are able to imagine you have gone back in time with the movie. I like movies that get young people interested in understanding what it was like before they were born. Yet, if you are going to go through all the trouble of recreating the 1950s, the time-travel fantasy effect would work better if the acting were more believable. On the other hand, they overdo the sin-city decay of the 1985 present, for a small American town/city. There are some echoes of Bedford Falls without George Bailey, from It's a Wonderful Life (which would make a nice companion viewing). And speaking of connections, I believe this is the same town set used in Harvey with James Stewart, and for Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (?).The bottom line is Back to the Future starts with a cute concept and gives it several layers of action and irony that keep you amused. It succeeds in the rare accomplishment for a comedy of working just about as effectively upon subsequent viewings. This is because the humor is not based on crude jokes or bad language, but on the manipulation of the tension in the awkward, off-balance relationships between the characters. Part of the genius of this film is the way these awkward relationships are resolved to the audience's immense satisfaction.These strengths are why I still enjoy this film, despite the over- acting. But producer Steven Spielberg is certainly no fool, especially when it comes to hitting the bulls-eye with younger viewers. So I must assume this is what he was aiming for.

There he must figure out a way to get back to the future and also get his parents to fall in love since he accidentally interferes with their first meeting.The story is great in this film. Time travel is a tricky thing but I think that this film does a simple job of explaining it so that general audiences can understand it more. However it still has a lot that confuses me but I guess with time travel in a movie the more that you think about it the more that you will have your mind boggled. So it is best just to accept what happens and not over think it.Marty is a great leading character who people can probably relate to. Michael J. Fox is awesome as him. Also Christopher Lloyd is amazing as Doctor Emmett Brown, this is probably his best acting performance in a film. Overall the relationship between Marty and Doc is believable and well done and it is one of the major things these films have going for them.The main antagonist Biff is also great. He really is just the type of jerk that seems to exist in a lot of 80s movies.The conflict of the story is great and it really keeps you at the edge of your seat.

Consider the Doc Brown of 1955, who, upon learning that his future self wears a radiation suit, concludes that the reason is ""all the fallout from the atomic wars."" By 1985, nuclear war was considered unlikely enough to be funny, but the memory of the fear of it was still near enough for audiences to get the joke. The characterizations in Back to the Future are also shaped by '80s sensibilities, not only in Marty McFly's slang-slinging, rock-loving, denim-clad teen, but in the different ""present day"" versions of his parents, George and Lorraine. In one timeline, the distinctly old- fashioned McFlys are at the mercy of a stylish, macho go-getter, while in a ""better"" timeline they are sporty and flaunt their economic status. Their success may well have been presented differently had the film been made 10 years earlier or later when the middle class ideal was something other than a track suit and a ranch house. The time capsule that is ""Back to the Future"" remains engaging and entertaining today partly despite and partly because of its clear position on our reality's timeline.",Back to the Future

266,krational66,Classic sections and details.,8,7 April 2020,"It is said that the director originally wanted to shoot a scene of a nuclear explosion, the company did not give Monty, so the story can only be placed in a small town. There is no nuclear explosion, no laser sword, the director and screenwriter must only attract the audience from the details. Wearing ck underwear, the protagonists of the Nike canvas shoes returned to1995, and he simple changed his name to Calvin Klein, pretending to be an alien and scaring his dad to a dad to dance with this mother. Holding a Gibson casino guitar at the graduation ball of his parents and playing a Johnny bgoode, and finally came a fan brother's hands to string, making the 55-year high school students stunned, the protagonist said: your kids gonna love it. And the guitarist with an injured hand called his cousin chuck berry to let him listen to the song, and rock music was born.
Skateboard chasing this classic bridge must have originated from this movie. The protagonist was in the west in 1885, the director paid tribute to Clint Eastwood. I don't know if Fukuoka Fukui has seen this movie. The hero in Doraemon has also set a talent for precise shooting. I remember in a long story, Nobita also became a cowboy and rescued the beauty. When the person selling the Clot pistol asked the protagonist: Where did you learn this hand. Seven eleven convenience store, the protagonist replied. And we already know the protagonist's skills on the game console in 2015.
The first dog of the doctor was Copernicus, and the dog in 1985 was already Einstein. You can imagine how many dogs the doctor has raised. After reading it, I knew how much the movie Westward Journey and the 90s used to return to the future.

269,HelloTexas11,fast blast back to the '50s,7,16 April 2008,"'Back to the Future' was hugely successful, mainly with teens and mainly because it ties in to their hang-ups, angst, and fantasies. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) deals with them all as teens only wish they could, jumping on a skateboard when things get too sticky, outsmarting the bully, and zipping through time in a REALLY souped-up Delorean. Fox doesn't so much act as hyperventilate his way through the film; he is constantly on the move, frenetic and frantic, forever running to or from one thing or the other, and shouting ""Doc!"" a lot. His energy level is admirable, even though I got tired just watching him. This is precisely what teenagers, particularly teen boys, empathize with so deeply in this movie. The best solution to any problem is to not stand still. Run like hell and maybe something will come to you. The film's script is clever and in keeping with Fox's performance, really over-the-top and unashamedly silly at times. With the help of Christopher Lloyd's goofily eccentric Doc Brown, he travels back in time to 1955 and meets his own parents, before they were married. There are a number of nifty twists and turns in the time-travel plot, and the other characters are very well-cast. Crispin Glover does a great job as Marty's dim-bulb father George as does Lea Thompson, portraying Lorraine, his mother. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty back in the '50s (obviously not knowing who he is, or will be) and one of several problems Marty faces is making sure that she and George end up together. Glover and Thompson, along with Thomas F. Wilson as Biff, the bully, actually outshine Fox's breathless portrayal and Lloyd's incessant mugging. The gags and situations are sometimes obvious but have a good batting average; upon learning from Marty that the president in 1985 is Ronald Reagan, the 1955 Doc Brown says, quite understandably, ""Ronald Reagan? The actor? Who's the vice-president... Jerry Lewis?"" There is also an entertaining sequence at a high school dance where Marty and a back-up band perform a freaked-out, almost 'metal' version of 'Johnny B. Goode.' The film even takes it a step further, having Marvin Berry (Chuck's cousin) call him in the middle of the performance to let him listen, making the almost blasphemous suggestion that this is what gave Chuck Berry the impetus to create rock and roll! 'Back to the Future' is so good-natured, though, that it gets away with this as well as Lorraine's flirtation with Marty. Fox and the film are sufficiently likable that it all seems harmless, which it is. Two popular sequels followed, but they lack the charm and upbeat feeling of the first movie, a frenzied fun-ride through time.",Back to the Future

273,David_Frames,Delorean took cocaine,10,16 February 2004,"Back to the Future concerns itself with an accidental trip into the past facilitated by a converted Delorean Sports Car. What isn't fully explored is the role that poor production values, industrial incompetence and the subsidies of the British Taxpayer, propping up a failing and corrupt American adventure capitalist, played in Marty Mcfly's near-on temporal suicide and submission to incest.The time machine was the product of substandard labour from a ill-trained Ulster work force. In an area where zealots and murderers had ruined the local economy in the pursuit of an imagined community but with an all-consuming disdain for democracy and the value of human life, Delorean had stepped in, not for altruistic purposes but because of tax breaks afforded to him by the then Labour Government who were desperate to do something about the stifling level of provincial unemployment. If these men couldn't get jobs then they might be tempted to take up arms and join the mob, knee capping young men under the pretext of collusion of the Unionists and the British Army or, if there was no such man, kidnap mothers in front of their children and shoot them in the head. Thus mainland British taxpayers, who worked hard and had no part in the religious hatred that had ruined this community, began to have their cash syphoned off for the sake of a PR initiative. At stake - the vanity and greed of John Delorean, a man who saw the local fat, semi-literate workforce with their half-baked, bigoted ideals as the perfect contingent to fashion his overpriced, poorly designed sports car. The stainless steel construction would later be cited as conducive to allowing the mechanism of time travel to take place but in practice it was the cars poor acceleration and botched circuitry that would prove more decisive when Marty was forced to flee for his life from Libyan terrorists. Marty's odyssey into the past nearly wiped out his existence and could have lead to sexual intercourse with his mother. At the root of it all we may look to the folly of cheap Labour, poor management and a cheated British electorate.Some good laughs.",Back to the Future

277,ryan_kuhn,"""1.12 Gigawatts? Great Scott!""",8,13 February 2005,"Time travel movies make people have headaches, so Robert Zemeckis wisely added another layer to his movie, Back To the Future. The central question of Back To the Future is not what would it be like to go back in time, but rather, a bigger question: ""What were my parents like as teenagers?"" As teenagers, we always heard our parents give us rules about what we could and could not do, and we never thought maybe our parents were telling us what not to do because they did that stupid stuff themselves, we just assumed they always knew best. But what would it really be like to see what kind of awful things our parents did while young. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), for better or for worse, finds out in Back To the Future. While trying to outrun Libyan terrorists in a modified DeLorian, McFly is transported back to October 27, 1955, 30 years in the past for this 1985 film. Doc Brown (a manic Christopher Lloyd) invents the process to time travel and put it all together in the DeLorian, and is a young scientist when McFly looks him up in 1955. Not believing the story of ""Future Boy,"" especially after he says Ronald Reagan was president in 1985, but is eventually convinced and tries to help the young man out. While trying to get back to 1985, McFly accidentally ruins the moment that his father (Crispin Glover) meets his mother (Lea Thompson), possibly ending his own life. Parents don't meet, they don't have babies, and don't have Marty. Worse, Marty's mother starts to fall for him, so he needs to get his father and mother back together. Seeing his parents back in their teenage days is enlightening and will serve as a surprise at the end of the movie. There are several jokes about time and space, how Twin Pines Mall becomes Single Pine Mall is amusing and other changes to the town from the beginning of the movie to the end is interesting. But most of all, what would your parents to be like if you visited them 30 years ago? A great question, though do you really want it answered?",Back to the Future
278,Fields201,1985 was a very good year,10,26 October 2010,"""Tell me, future boy! Who was President of the United States in 1985?"" And Marty quipped, ""Ronald Reagon."" ""Ronald Reagon? The actor? Who was vice president? Jerry Lewis?""Honestly, who doesn't love Back to the Future? I mean, seriously, who doesn't love Back to the Future? It's one of those rare movies that after you watch it, it just isn't enough, you have to watch it again. It's been 25 years later, generations had come and go, and even the new generation has fond memories of this remarkable movie.I think a lot of it is in its plot device and imagination. The imagination is so deep that it's almost plausible that you can travel through time with a little plutonium and a flux capacitor at a speed of 88 miles per hour. It could work! But part of the fun is its whimsical charm, and the humor laced into a sort of innocence and lightheartedness felt throughout the movie. The plot alone required some tongue and cheek humor as we find Marty mistakingly going back in time to 1955 - accidentally running into his parents in the process - and discovers that he made a crucial error of taking his dad's place and subjecting himself to his mom falling head over heels for him. Because of this, he created a time paradox that if he doesn't bring his parents together, he will cease to exist. Not only that, but he has only one chance to get back to the future, or be stuck in the past forever.As great as the plot (and especially the script) is, there is one vital importance to carry this film, and that is the performances. The Bobs made a wise decision casting Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in just the way his mannerisms are, and how animated he is in his expressions. Just watch the scene in the beginning when Marty and Jennifer are outside Hill Valley, and Marty gets a hard on for that new truck. It's a scene that could bore you to tears but it was the writing and the performances that really put those finishing touches. To further demonstrate, just check out the scenes between Marty and Doc Brown (played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd). Their chemistry together is like pancakes and syrup. Neither one of them steals a scene from each other, because they play off each other so well that they almost need each other to sell the scene.As a kid I was inspired to go skateboarding after that scene where Marty outsmarted Biff and his gang on the streets of Hill Valley. To this day, it is a classic scene. But as an adult, I appreciated the action in the ending because of the cinematography. It felt like a terrible night from hell, even if the sound effects are a little outdated. The way everything went wrong and Doc managing to fix the situation in the nick of time that zapped Marty back to 1985. It was all breathtaking stuff, and accompanied by a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and the wonderful direction of Bob Zemeckis.I really can't give a high enough praise for this timeless film. Since 1985, a lot of the dialogue became catch phrases. ""Hello, McFly!"" was a common use of explaining someone was an idiot in my family. I think the world used that too. That might have explained Crispin Glover's lack of involvement for the sequels. I guess he wasn't fond of George McFly. Now that's heavy!",Back to the Future
279,Meredith-7,Absolutely FANTASTIC,10,2 July 1999,"I recently watched this film again after quite a number of years and I was surprised by how well the film has held together.  Its really entertaining, all the characters are likeable, the premise is just great.  This is without a doubt one of the best films of the 80's.  Some of the metaphysical aspects of it may be a little off kilter to do with time casuality, past/present etc..  But that does not stop it from being immensely entertaining, and the basic idea and theories behind the concept of time travel are reasonably correct.  What is great about this film is how they use the science fiction concept as a base without straying away from contemporary mid 80s America. This film has a well deserved place in the top 250.",Back to the Future

You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays.

The 80's spawned a rich variety of franchise films and the Back To The Future series can be considered one of the better ones. Central to the success of the film are the performances, this is a science fiction blockbuster relatively light on special effects and more concerned with character and plot. All the actors are great, Lloyd and Fox of course,but praise must also go to Crispin Glover who plays his wet blanketed nerd with a heart role to perfection. The script is sharp and the production design is outstanding with a picture postcard image of the 1950's well realised and the Deloreon time machine a great touch. Zemeckis' last film Romance In The Stone proved how well he could handle entertaining popcorn movies and he succeeds beyond expectation here with a highly energised, fun packed time travelling adventure to remember.",Back to the Future
284,CrassActionHero,Definitely the Best of the Trilogy,10,10 February 2007,"Back to the Future (1985) Review: Ah yes. This is such a classic. This is easily the best time travel movie ever. Good times.Back to the Future is loads of fun. We start with Marty McFly who's goal is to be a rock star one day. He is friends with a kooky, but brilliant scientist, Doc Brown played well by Christopher Lloyd.Doc makes a DeLorean into a time machine. That's the start. Before we know it, Marty is back in time....30 years to be exact! He now has to live in 1955. This starts off some great fun and a intelligent story.This movie not only is smart, but has a lot of heart. When Marty winds up meeting his soon to be father, he jumps and is shocked too. He also meets his mother as well. This movie is telling something else too is that our parents were young too. Marty now sees that they were young and foolish in there teenage years as well. This gives the movie some depth. All parents are mature, but back then were just like him.The theory of time travel is well explained. Who knows if mankind will ever create the ability to time travel? This was explained well enough. Who knows what the possibilities are? Can you change history? Who knows? And kudos to Christopher Lloyd. He was just a hoot as Doc Brown.The Last Word: One of my favorites. Back to The Future rules. This movie has a great soundtrack and a great look recreating the 1950's too. It's like you the viewer went back in time! Highly recommended!",Back to the Future
285,sandnair87,Robert Zemeckis Brings the Sci-Fi/ Fantasy Genre 'Back To' Life!,9,26 August 2015,"Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager growing up in the 80s. He hopes to make a man out of his milquetoast father, the middle-aged George McFly (a deliciously funny sad sack as played by 20-year-old Crispin Glover) who is still groveling at the feet of his former high school classmate, a perpetual bully named Biff. Marty's prim mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) appears to be drowning her frustrations in vodka. The movie does not really catch fire until, when testing out a souped-up DeLorean as a time machine with his eccentric, wide-eyed, wild-haired stork of a mad scientist friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (played by the hilariously frazzled Christopher Lloyd), Marty is whisked back to 1955. Here, he comes face to face with his nerdy teenage dad and also his unrecognizably gorgeous mom. After inadvertently causing his own mother to become infatuated with him – who finds him an absolute dreamboat, it is left up to Marty to repair the course of time and ensure that she falls in love with his future father, George or face being erased out of existence altogether. To do so, he gets in touch with a young Doc, who is as much a fish out of water in the past as he is in the present, and persuades him to send him back to 1985. Can he put things right and return to the future before it's too late?Director Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future represents that rare perfect matrimony of everything a film needs to succeed, from the adroit direction, the immaculately styled performances and the scintillating visual effects that never swamp the film. The constituent elements would not operate without the film's biggest triumph – its screenplay – which is among the most economic and brilliantly composed, for there are no disposable lines of dialogue; everything spoken is either cuttingly funny and heartfelt (check Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""), or employed to foreshadow a temporal event later in the film.Anchoring it all is Fox's stumbling charm. The boyishly good-looking Fox is charming as the lead, exuding cocksure – yet never arrogant – buoyancy. Lloyd, meanwhile, nails his Einstein-on-acid role perfectly, never venturing too far into caricature, yet spinning the archetypal mad scientist role with a wink and a nod, making it unquestionably his signature performance. Together, they make an idiosyncratic couple, for sure, but a perfect one at that.In Back to the Future, there is an effervescence to the filmmaking, a bubbling, giddy effortlessness that's almost addictive. It's ingenuity, time-traveling twist ups and wonderfully vibrant characters resonate in ways few films ever achieve. It is an unadulterated cinematic experience!",Back to the Future

It was a huge hit in 1985 and I caught it on video soon after, it was the most entertaining and feel good movie I had seen up to that point. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd got the roles of their life in this film and Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson are great too. The whole time travel concept is brilliantly realised, the great thing about time travel is that it gives the film-makers many oppurtunities to insert some clever in jokes into the movie and they do that a lot in BTTF. They promised follow up at the end of the movie arrived four years later, which interestingly was filmed at the same time as Part III. Although they were enjoyable enough I couldn't help but be disappointed by them, neither had the magic of this one unfortunately. ***9/10***",Back to the Future
290,CMTiago,Time traveling was never the same,10,15 August 2014,"Sure one might argue that this movie does have some discrepancies in the time-line, still what makes most of us forget this, is the wonderful story being told on screen, which is why I believe many people, including myself, fell in love with this movie. Starring the newest star on the block back then, Back To The Future is a thrill ride that will surely entertain you, and for me part of the success of the film was due to wonderful dynamic acting by Michael J. Fox. When you add in Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and many others who put up great supporting roles, as well as a delightful (despite its plot holes) script, then this a must-see movie.The movie's narrative focuses on a young boy named Marty McFly, who having traveled back in time to 1955, in his friend Doc Brown's time machine, has to fix his parents with each other in order to assure his existence. Factor in a comedic side to the story with his mom feeling attracted to him and a more dramatic side with Marty struggling to tell 1955 Doc that he dies in 1985, just before Marty traveled to 1955, and I would say the story is balanced. Just like Jurassic Park would put dinosaurs in the midst of popularity in 1993, I believe time traveling was a hot topic among those who watched and enjoyed the movie in 1985. It's that kind of reaction that I think creates a classic movie.It might not be the most perfect film, however Back To The Future is blockbuster royalty and an audience favorite. It pleases with its light comedy and might even cause a few tears here and there. Bottom line: I don't think I'll ever stop loving this movie.Rating: 10/10",Back to the Future

Fox, Christopher Lloyd and Robert Zemeckus. Released in mid-1985, met with rousing popular and critical acclaim, which proved to be a goldmine for Universal Studio, who made two more (less good) sequels some years later. In this movie you'll see a combination of some of the best and most lively acting ever captured on film by a perfectly chosen cast, many of which play dual-roles to great effect. Plus, for this sci-fi classic, a profoundly brilliant and singularly witty screenplay masterfully guides the flow of things to come (and that which what has already happened - in the past), which is a confoundingly complex and interwoven series of twists and turns, so many, in fact, that only a mere handful of movie's have more. Largely due to it's brilliant writing (and great line readings) Back To The Future is easily one of the most quotable films ever made (perhaps only GHOSTBUSTERS packs more quotes) and that particularly holds true for Doc Brown, who not only has most of the movies best lines, but also puts the most enthusiasm into said lines. At the heart of the film is a unique, one-of-a-kind vehicle (a HEAVILY MODIFIED DeLorian) of Doc Brown's creation, (without it there would be no Back To The Future) that enables it's operator to travel any where in time AND in highly dramatic fashion an unlucky Marty McFly does just that - and not exactly by design. I find that the car makes some of the sweetest sounding vehicular sounds ever and I always wondered if were hearing the live sound or was it over-dubbed in post production. Either which way, a plethora of amazing engine sounds (do I detect a turbine whine?) emanate from under the ""trunk"" as DeLorian's are indeed a rear engine design; especially after Doc Brown's handy-work!For a Sci-Fi film, the special effects in Back To The Future are unusually sparse in their application (though brilliantly effective when they are used), you might even say that their under-used, but if at any time you sit back and analyze what you're seeing, eventually you'll realize it's really more of a ""human drama"" than a Sci-Fi film. Musically speaking, along with Huie Luis and the News, Back To The Future is powerfully enhanced by an amazingly effective and mostly up-beat score by a young Alan Silvestre; just listen to how grandly effective his music is during the finale when combined with, A: the variety of sounds from the car and B: the crushing and unrelenting thunder from the storm that rages over Hill Valley (another early triumph, from yet another artist who had a leading hand in the making of this iconic and universally popular film). Speaking of THAT finale, Back To The Future's rip-roaring, high-voltage, thunder n' lightning finale, is easily one of the -most exciting- sequences ever devised (year after year it's the ONLY part of ANY movie that routinely makes the hair on my arms stand up - every time I see it). Unfortunately the two sequels that followed in 89' and 90' are not as good as this, but are pretty good for sequels.Brilliant in every conceivable way, this time-travel-blockbuster-spectaculaire remains one of cinema's brightest triumphs of creative film-making.",Back to the Future

The effects and sound effects are spectacular, but the hook into the film are the hilarious and lovable characters, the terrific performances, and the editing job put into the film. The story is one of the greatest screenplays ever.Marty Mcfly is an average teen in 1985 whose friend, Doc Brown, invents a time machine out of a Dolorian. Marty accidentally activates it while running from terrorists, and travels to the year 1955, where he meets his parents-to-be as teens, screwing up their first meet. On top of getting them back together, he teams up with the past Doc Brown to fix the time machine to be able to send him back to his time period. The conflicts and plot of the story are all spectacular and work brilliantly to the core.Has tons of laughs along the way. The doc, played by Christopher Lloyd, is without a doubt the best character. His crazy scientist ways will have your gut busted with laughter. The clever irony works terrificly as well, especially with scenes with Martie's teen parents.

Back to the Future IS the 80's. It's funny, charming, sweet, and completely enjoyable. Dare, I say, it's one of the most enjoyable films ever made.There had to be a point during the writing process when someone said, ""This is it."" The plot is movie magic. Teenager goes back in time to save his future by fixing the past of his parents? Brilliant! And it works so well because of the phenomenal, tightly written script. All the little things are important and all tie together. It's so cool to see the same scene happen in two time periods, but the action is exactly the same. Like the diner with Biff/ Marty's house with Biff. It's laugh out loud funny, with plenty of period gags (Reagan, who the hell is John F. Kennedy?), and sweet, with goodbyes and relationships that clearly inspired modern film and TV (Lost Season 5?). The pacing is perfect, with a constant sense of movement, and Zemeckis can weave suspense whenever he wants, be it the first 88 mph or the super- tense climax.In this cartoon world are cartoon characters, and Back to the Future is filled with gems. Marty McFly, one of the most iconic teenagers,is pure charisma. ""That's heavy stuff!"" We wish we were Marty. He's too cool. Doc Brown, with his great phrases and even better facial expressions, is just so dang lovable. And the first time I saw this, I completely overlooked George McFly. He is hilarious. Brilliantly pathetic.It's impossible to not like Back to the Future. Sometimes it crosses the line into cheesy (NOOOOO!), the CG looks fake in some places, and personally I don't like the role reversal of George and Biff at the end (he became what we hated in the beginning), but those are small things. Back to the Future is one of the best 80's movies, and has undeniable charm. You have to see this one. 9.3/10",Back to the Future

And that's the slant - it feels like it was formulaicly designed to have as much mass-audience appeal as possible. Much like Indiana Jones or the MCU, this tries to take you back to those Saturday Morning Cartoons - hip young teen and his mad scientist friend and their time-travelling rock'n'roll misadventures. Oh, watch out, they have to jump-start Doc's time-machine Delorean (in earlier drafts it was a refrigerator) just in the knick of time as lightning strikes the clock tower in the town square. This movie basically demands that you watch it in your pajamas while eating cereal. The production, direction, and pace are all fine. Michael J. Fox is hilariously bad and Christopher Lloyd is clearly having fun in his over-the-top madcap role. It's a serviceable diversion, but the problem with pop-culture is that it's elevated this movie way too far above its lot.",Back to the Future

313,haydenluz,Back to the Future,10,21 January 2021,"Back to the Future, directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, originated and produced by the great Steven Spielberg, was this highly inventive, and I quote, ""heavy"" film! Back to the Future may not have been the first film to take a shot at time travel, but it's the film that broke barriers, and holds up the most out of Time After Time & Terminator, along with other early titles. This film is so heavily guarded; a lot of people say it's almost a flawless film, with good reason. Back to the Future has so many memorable scenes, having this original style, that many film makers later tried to mimic.Michael J. Fox, has his first major role in a motion picture, and he puts on a phenomenal & energetic performance, making his character, as Marty McFly, very bold, and entertaining! His character development throughout the film brings a lot of an enjoyable wit and comedy, adding great layers, so we can really care about his character. Christopher Llyod, who is most noticed for One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest, put on a trademark performance! Chris Llyod NAILED his performance! He carried himself with this quirky & loud, yet brilliant and thoughtful attitude, that was admirable to all. His character development during the second and third act was the best out of all the characters! Thomas F. Wilson played a great, stereotypical bully, in Biff. He was a cliché character, and meant to hate, but he is absolutely hilarious.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale was ahead of it's time, along with some of the scenes and risks they took! He crafted a very intelligent and creative script, that flowed just right for the 80's, then flowed even better with the 50's, adding consistent tongue and cheek humor.The score by the up and coming, Alan Silvestri, had this magical, yet suspenseful, and even a few sad tones to it. This score was absolutely phenomenal, backed up with a great song by Huey Lewis & the News, That's the Power of Love.Overall, I can go on and on about how great this film is, completely understanding as to why people would call this film flawless. It is absolutely fantastic!!! With only one notable award from the Academy Awards, being Best Sound Editing, this film has a lot to be proud of, and A LOT of nomination worthy aspects. Robert Zemeckis set up the sequel perfectly, and if I was around in the late 80s, I would have definitely went to go support it.",Back to the Future
314,clydestuff,"Tell me, doctor, where are we going this time?",10,18 March 2004,"Good time travel films have always held a certain amount of fascination for me despite the improbability and implausible concept involved. Traveling through time is one of those ""what if"" fantasies one can continually dwell. I never grow tired of considering the endless possibilities involved if such thing were possible. I especially enjoy when a film gives us a new and entertaining twist on the subject. With Back To The Future, director and writer Robert Zemeckis along with writer Bob Gale has given us not only one of the best of the genre, but began one of the truly great film trilogies.If you don't know the story by now, Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) is a teenager with more than his share of problems. His father, George(Crispin Glover) gives new definition to the meaning of the word dork, his mother Lorraine(Lea Thompson) is a worn out closet alcoholic, his brother Dave (Marc McClure) works at a fast food joint, and his sister Linda(Wendie Jo Sperber) is on the verge of becoming an old maid. Outside of the home, a teacher named Strickland(James Tolkan) has it in for Marty constantly referring to him a slacker and his father's co-worker, Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) is constantly intimidating George even to the point of having George doing his work assignments for him. Marty's best friend is an old scientist named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and his girlfriend is Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). It is his relationships with Jennifer and Doc Brown that enable Marty to think he might somehow escape the trials and tribulations of his Daily life. Well, Marty does escape, but not a manner that he could not have imagined in his worst nightmare. It seems that Doc Brown has invented a time machine out of a Delorean and through a series of misadventures Marty gets transported back to his home town in the year 1955. Not only does Marty meet his parents and his Dad's arch enemy Biff as teenagers, he somehow manages to interfere with Lorraine and George's romance, thus jeopardizing his own existence. It is left up to the Doc Brown of the past to help Marty set things right, and somehow find a way to return Marty ""Back To The Future.""This scenario sets up endless possibilities and Zemeckis and Gale make full use of the concept. Not only do they have Marty interfering with his parents relationship, but his mother develops a crush on him in one of the most hilarious romantic encounters one could imagine. The more Marty tries to set things right, the more Lorraine becomes infatuated with him. Don't worry, Zemeckis and Gale never let the idea sink into sleaziness, but instead develop it into one hilarious moment after another. What is amazing also is watching how the life of the teenage Lorraine is as different from the adult Mrs. Mcfly as night and day. It's a revelation to Marty and to us. As for George, it seems he has always been somewhat of a cowardly type, but as Marty discovers, he had hopes and dreams as a teenager much as many of us did.Michael J. Fox was the perfect choice to play Marty McFly. Initially, because of his TV series commitment, he had to take a pass. When Eric Stoltz was not working out as Marty, Fox was thankfully able to work things out to be able to do the film. For that we shall forever be grateful. It's not that I think Eric Stoltz is not a good actor, but his laid back and darker personality would never have fit into what Marty was. Christopher Lloyd brings a characterization to Doc Brown that makes him the glue that holds the idea of time travel together. He's crazy enough to come up with the idea of a DeLorean Time Machine and has us believe he could make good on the concept. His friendship with Marty is believable enough that their on screen moments together seem genuine and sincere. There is no other way to put it except to say that if there is one character in this movie stranger than Doc, it's Crispin Glover's George. His portrayal gives new meaning to the words wimpy coward. Lea Thompson as Lorraine sets the pace for everyone. Her future Lorraine is different in so many aspects from the teenage Lorraine, yet Ms. Thompson is able to pull it off without a hitch and still have us believe they are one and the same person. There is nothing lovable about Thomas Wilson's biff. He is the consummate high school bully that many of us dealt with on more than one occasion. We have to admit a great satisfaction in how his character is dealt with.Of course, as I have mentioned in other films about time travel, all this good stuff could have been wasted if the film makers had copped out at the end. It's the kind of thing that has ruined many other films of the genre. Zemeckis and Gale not only do not hesitate in their assumptions of the possibilities of what happens when you interfere with the past, they take the ball and run with it making the film just that much more satisfying.If you were to look at a list of my favorite films, you would see Back To The Future on there, occupying a place of prominence. It is in the top 250 films on the IMDB, and one of the films that earned its place justifiably so. And if you are on my personal list, and that list also, you get my grade and in this case it equals an A+.",Back to the Future
315,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Great '80's film, way better than its sequels",10,1 February 2005,"Back to the Future was made in 1985. Let's say that the '80's was a very mixed time for films. There were some cheesy sci-fi moves, a lot of teen movies(the most popular ones were made by John Hughes), there were movies made specifically for the special effects, and there were plenty of raunchy comedies like the classic Risky Business and Revenge of the Nerds. During the time of its release, many movie companies weren't predicting Back To The Future to do as well since it didn't have anything raunchy in it, and it was different from a lot of other movies. However, all of those reasons are the real reason behind why this movie did so well.(possible Spoilers) The movie is a creative look at the awe and danger of time travel. A teen named Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) never gets to school on time and he doesn't get as much as he deserves. His family is kind of off beat, but all of this changes one day. A man he knows named Dr. Emitt Browm(played enthusiastically by Christopher Lloyd) has invented a car that has the ability to travel through time. Due to a certain event, Marty ends up thirty years into the past with no way to get back. Now he needs to find a way to get back to the future before he vanishes into time. This movie is actually way better than what it sounds through my summary.The special effects were groundbreaking for back in their time, the acting is good, and this movie takes a realistic approach at the dangers of time travel. I'd recommend this movie to anybody, even younger kids will probably enjoy this. The sequels aren't bad, but they aren't as good as the original.",Back to the Future

Middle aged people can get their kicks out of it  as a nostalgic trip back in time whereas younger people can relate to Marty as being a fish out of water  in a time where he is unfamiliar with customs / culture.

319,Doublej20005,A True Classic,10,22 February 2021,"An 80's classic that still holds up tremendously well, Back to the Future is iconic from start to finish. This truly is a masterpiece in setup and payoff. Whilst some might find the exposition towards the beginning tiresome, it kept me engaged as I knew that the payoff was coming in the second half. The humour really is second to none, and the characters are genuinely great. They could have ended up being stereotypical, but they ended up working really well. The score is another fantastic element - it's one of the most iconic scores of all time. Michael J Fox is obviously iconic as Marty, and his delivery is really good aswell. The effects mostly hold up well, but they don't need to because of how strong the story is. It really is one of the most simple yet enjoyable films of all time. My only tiny gripe is the final scene with Doc Brown returning and taking them to the future. I think it restricted what they could do in the sequel, and feels quite tacked on and annoying. I know it is an iconic scene, I just don't think it really works at all. Still, this isn't a big enough issue for me to not give this the 5 star rating it thoroughly deserves. It's a truly timeless film (Get it? Because time travel) and I'd definitely recommend it.",Back to the Future

There isn't a single thing in Back to the Future that I would change. There isn't a dull moment. Even the more serious scenes somehow manage to be lighthearted.Most importantly though, this film just gives me a wonderful feeling. I found myself smiling for almost the entire runtime.

321,moviemattb,"One of the best, if not the best about time travel",10,21 November 2015,"It has been thirty years since this movie came out, and has now become a household name as everyone around the world makes references from each scene they reenact, quote lines from each character they say and make parodies out of it. ""Back to the Future"" is one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the best if not the best about time travel. There have been plenty of movies about time travel, but when it comes to time travel movies I think of this one. So with said, the movie is about Marty McFly who accidentally goes back in time to 1955 as he alters history by saving his father from getting hit by a car, and his mother for falling in love as well as his existence. So Marty has to put it all back as how things should be, while Doc Brown tries to get Marty back home to 1985. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do work well together like bread and butter. Lea Thompson looks lovely and she really plays her role really well. The rest of the cast all did great. The movie itself is really funny, and it is also exciting too. The movie doesn't feature that many special effects by ILM, but I love the effects for the car traveling through time just as what it appears in the movie without any time travel sequence like having a portal or something. The design of the DeLorean for being used as a time travel vehicle is really iconic, and loved the way how it looks. The music by Alan Silvestri is so unforgettable, and loved hearing the theme that he created. The movie is very well scripted, and I thought Robert Zemeckis does a really good job on directing this movie after making another movie that is also good ""Romancing the Stone."" The production design for the 1955 scenes are outstanding, and I thought the pacing of the movie is top-notch. I really hope Hollywood doesn't try to remake this or the sequels, because they're fine for what they are; just like what everyone says ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I have nothing against remakes, but sometimes it just gets lazy for Hollywood to try to come up with some new stories, and new ideas for what movie is there to make. So please, for one last time as I say this ""DON""T REMAKE THIS MOVIE OR THE SEQUELS!"" Now I got that out of my way, so now I need to wraps things up with this review, ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a classic movie, and really can't say no more about it.

I wouldn't classify it as a comedy, because it won't have you on the floor rolling. It's more of a really light adventure film that has a simple, clean plot that doesn't claim to be anything more than what it is.Marty McFly is your typical, trouble-making 80's teenager, who grows up in a troubled household. His father doesn't know how to stand up for himself and doesn't live up to his full potential due to an intense fear of rejection. His mother is obviously dissatisfied with her life and is an alcoholic. His older brother has a dead end job. And Marty has the same fear of rejection his father does. Except Marty is more adventurous, and his uncanny friendship with a mad scientist leads him to travel back in time 30 years, to the time when his parents met. Due to some unlucky mishaps, the younger version of his mother ends up falling in love with Marty instead of his father. Marty must race against the clock to correct history and get his parents to fall in love, and ultimately to return...back to the future.This is such a cult classic. It is literally ""timeless"", and is a must-see for any generation. Michael J Fox is perfect in his innocent, boy-hood portrayal of Marty McFly.

325,alexpeychev,A Time -Travelling Classic,10,25 January 2021,"Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics.",Back to the Future
326,joshuafagan-64214,An Eighties Classic,10,31 August 2015,"This may not be the best movie of the eighties. But it is the movie that I deem to best represent the cinema and spirit of the decade. If you're wondering, that movie for the fifties is Rebel Without a Cause. For the sixties, it's Planet of the Apes. For the seventies, it's Apocalypse Now. For the nineties, it's the Truman Show. For the 2000s, it's The Dark Knight. For the 2010s, it's... I don't know. The Social Network? Anyways; let's dive in to this film, possibly my favorite true action-comedy of all time. If I want to be entertained for two hours, this is the film I'll pop in. There are two kinds of excellence in film; the kind that appeals to what 'normal people' want in movies and the kind that appeals to those who deal probably deal far too much in the esoteric. While I firmly belong in the second group, I am a film-goer, and as such, I do enjoy the first kind. And no film offers more of the first kind than this one.The comedy, the action, the tone, the stylings; they're all here. It does not try to be a big, emotional artsy movie. Instead, it just takes you for an enjoyable ride. The eighties did this kind of movie better than any decade. When you think of eighties movies, you likely think of these movies. This is the best one, but the likes of The Goonies, Ghostbusters, Gremlins, and likely any other movie in this decade with the involvement of Steven Spielberg comes to mind.Not to say that the eighties didn't try to make serious movies too. they just weren't very good at it. If you're interested, look up a list of Best Picture winners. Watching them is a bit weird; they have some eighties stylings but are dead grim and often depressing. It's like watching a film from a different dimension. Some were fine (Terms of Endearment) some were not as good (Out of Africa).I like the lot of them as a whole better than most. And the ones that people really like (Amadeus, Platoon, etc) that people love, I likely love more. But I will admit that they aren't exactly foremost on most people's eyes. There's a reason that there aren't talks to remake Driving Miss Daisy. And it's not because it's artistic blasphemy. They would remake The Godfather if they thought that it would make them money.Here's a novel idea: how about I actually discuss Back to the Future? A high school kid named Marty McFly, down in the dumps from his high school life, where he is bullied by Biff Tannen and is under the control of the aptly named Principal Strickland (strangely, growing up, I had an insurance agent with that last name around by neighborhood. It was weird.) His home life isn't much better: his dad is a wimp, his mom is prudish enough to make one shrivel up, and his siblings are layabouts. But his life changes once his friend Doc Brown makes a time machine (2015 here. still waiting for one). As he stole plutonium form Libyan militants, they chase and kill him. While escaping in a DeLorean, Marty transports them back to 1955.Thus begins the best use of nostalgia for the fifties in an eighties movie I've ever seen. Their cleverness in weaving in it is matched only by what they do with their setting. Where as a lesser movie would just throw up scenery and call it a day, this film uses every opportunity to use its setting for purposes both comedic and dramatic.Whereas films like Dirty Dancing couldn't even immerse their film completely in one decade (if you're gonna be a fifties movie, don't use an eighties soundtrack), this movie somehow manages to immerse you in two decades. Their version of the fifties is solid and fully fleshed out. It does not use pandering or too many rosey tones but still manages to capture the sensation of time traveling there.All this is only likely noticed on a third viewing. The first time, you are too immersed in the perfect blend of action and comedy, a trademark of Zemeckis at his best, from Forrest Gump to Who Framed (not Killed, no matter what my brain thinks) Roger Rabbit, as well as in the tight writing. The second time, you are two invested in the characters and one of the best and catchiest soundtracks of the decade. But if you watch this movie as much as I do, you notice that it is there.What else is there to say? there is a reason that I have such a personal attachment to this film. The only bad thing is that we don't have a time machine that would allow this film to be watched an infinite amount of times without any real time passing. But maybe someday. After all, where we're going, we don't need roads.",Back to the Future
327,ray-280,One of the ten best films of the 20th century,10,4 April 2006,"You could rank Back To The Future on an all-time list of best movies for its special effects, and its in-depth exploration of time-travel in what almost seems plausible. I'm sure the physics professors could find fault with a few things, but the ""pop physics"" lesson we get to justify the plot is sufficient. This, however, would only make Back To The Future a great film. What makes it a REALLY GREAT film, however, is the ""buddy film"" aspect, or the amazingly close friendship that Marty and Doc have. Their level of trust and reliance upon each other is phenomenal. We are lucky if we ever have a friend like that, and this is what makes the movie memorable.For those who just got here in a time machine, the plot has typical high-schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), whose father George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), rejected high-school suitor of Marty's mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson). George is a Walter Mitty type who never stands up for himself, and this sickens Marty, who seeks refuge with his girlfriend, Jennifer (Claudia Wells and later Elizabeth Shue), and the crazy, independently wealthy scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd). School is no refuge for Marty, however, as the ""evil"" principal Mr. Strickland thinks he is a ""no good slacker."" Marty tries out for the battle of the bands, and Huey Lewis passes amusing judgment on him.Doc invites Marty to film his time-travel experiment, by sending his dog, Einstein, a minute into the future. The time machine itself could have gotten a Best Supporting Actor Oscar itself, as it was a souped-up DeLorean (the brainchild of John DeLorean, who had recently been acquitted of cocaine trafficking that was ruled government entrapment of a vulnerable man about to lose his business). Doc had figured out that if he got the DeLorean to 88 mph while creating 1.21 gigawatts of electricity, the car would travel through time. He never made clear how he pinpointed the destinations, but there was a console in the car that needed only to be set.The time-travel experiment is a success, but Marty soon learns (as gunmen approach) that Doc had gotten the plutonium necessary to generate the time travel had been stolen from Libyan terrorists who were out for revenge. They ""kill"" the Doc (who returns for II and III of this series, so draw your own conclusions), and Marty must escape their wrath in the DeLorean. To elude the Libyans, he floors the car, it hits 88 mph, and the next thing you know, Marty is back in 1955 and the movie ""begins."" Marty gets to see the ""romance"" between his parents develop, and he gets to compare their actual behavior with how they say things were, with predictable consequences. Marty looks up the Doc, who quickly realizes he is genuine, and blends into Hill Valley society. Marty then alters the future inadvertently, and he must repair his wrinkle before the key moment in his parents' hooking up, and then he has to find his way ""back to the future,"" something which will not be easy and which he will only have one chance to do.Marty needs Doc to accomplish his mission, but Doc also needs Marty, because otherwise he would be the proverbial ""tree falling in the forest"" with no one there to hear him. The film develops the buddy plot to perfection, and handles the time travel humorously and in the true tradition of fantasy films, doing the best they can to be technically accurate, but staying focused on the human side of the story in a way that will leave audiences of all ages satisfied.No DVD collection is complete without this film.",Back to the Future

There are tons of gripping movies out there, but Back to the Future is a quality fun and edge of your seat film...totally deserving of its place on the Top 250. The flow of the movie, the characters who make it - everything is just awesome. The lines...""1.21 gigawatts!"" or anything about the Flux Capacitor never fails to make me smile.One of the best things about Back to the Future is that it doesn't try to be anything special.

I like the story in the trilogy and the music composed by Alan Silvestri. The emotion in the films are classic. Marty and Doc are the greatest duo and the best of friends. Michael J. Fox was excellent playing Marty and Christopher Lloyd as Emmett Brown. Lea Thompson was cute playing Lorraine. Tom Wilson was hilarious as Biff Tannen.

Didn't we all fantasize one way or the other of having a time machine ( even a Delorean at that ! ) Michael J. Fox is a fit shoe as Marty and the whole cast blends in like a smoothie in a blender .

333,toll-8,Where your going you don't need any other film.,9,22 February 2012,"Back To The Future was a film I grew up on. It is one of those that I always remember watching as a child and one that never failed to entertain me. I was completely shocked however when I watched it recently and couldn't remember most of it. That being said I was right in remembering one thing, it is a damn great film.This is one of the only roles I really remember Michael J. Fox doing. Here he play Marty McFly, an iconic name to many out there today. He is a typical teenager, running late for school, eyeing up the girls and hating his family life. His father is a wimp, who is bullied by his boss, Biff and his mother is an alcoholic. His siblings also hold down poor jobs and aren't particularly lookers. Due to this Marty chooses to spend his time with Doc (Lloyd), a mad scientist who is planning an experiment at a shopping mall car park in the middle of the night and needs Marty's help to film it. The experiment is to do with Doc's latest invention, a time travelling DeLorean, much to Marty's shock and amusement. However during the experiment a group of Libyan terrorists barge in and shoot Doc for stealing their plutonium. Marty jumps into the DeLorean and drives at speed to get away but ends up blasting thirty years into the past.Once in the past Marty comes across his parents, and accidentally prevents them from meeting, meaning his own existence would eventually cease to exist. He enables the help of the younger Doc who sets out on finding a way to get Marty back to the future whilst he must find a way to make his parents meet and have that all important first kiss.The premise is fairly simple but has a lot of depth, the writing is just brilliant. The film drops in hints all over of everything that is going to happen. The opening ten minutes alone references the past constantly and ultimately sets us up for what is about to happen. Everything is sewn together at the end also and nothing is left loose, except for of course the very end but you will see for yourselves. All tiny plot lines are relevant and everything that is said has huge relevance, even the repetition of dialogue which mimics the characters in different eras of their lives. The dialogue at times is great and there is a fantastic reference to Star Wars and Star Trek. The writing, and the direction are a large reason to the great success of the film.The acting is also a big reason. Fox is great as the teenager we all will on to win. He is a character we can all relate to and all want to be. Right from the offset we want Marty McFly to succeed. Christopher Lloyd is also great, it is as if the role was specifically designed for him. He plays the crazy scientist with ease and he is a lovable character despite his tendencies to do the wrong thing. Marty's parents (Thompson and Glover) are excellent, Glover maybe more so. They both portray the elder parents and the teenage versions of themselves as if they are the age of the role they are playing. In fact they are the same age as Fox and were cast based around the story in the past and made up for the story in the future. Glover is just brilliant as the bumbling nerd and the hair style just works on Glover and Glover alone. We also get a bully in Biff, played by Thomas F. Wilson, who is also so pivotal. The acting for Biff is also top drawer and you really do hate him.The film has everything; humour, action, family fun, love, you name it, it has got it: even the creepy thunder storm and lightning strike. It will please any sort of movie fan whether it be the typical movie buff or the guy who only tunes in every now and again. It is a film not to be missed.My slight negative about it though is the relationship between Doc and Marty within the past. In the present we really believe they are friends but they don't spend too much screen time together in the past and I didn't quite believe that they were going to 'miss' each other like they said they would. I would possibly have liked to have seen a few more minutes of them two together. Maybe that is just me but it is my only negative with the film.I understand that this will probably make little sense. The referencing to past, present and future within this review is confusing. One thing I have thought about though is this: surely if you are watching the film Marty is always in the present? If there is a continuing time line on a constant loop will you ever be in the past or future? Wouldn't you just always be in your present? Just one to think about but do it before or after the film as it is one you just need to kick back with and enjoy.4.5 / 5 For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Back to the Future
334,dalton2,A masterpiece,9,8 December 2000,"I have seen this film dozens of times, and I always end up watching it from its beginning until its end without a single eye flick. This film is absolutely marvelous, and Michael J. Fox is perfect for the role he plays. There aren't many films which don't let you get up from your seat until the credits are scrolling, and this is one of them. It's incredibly funny and entertaining, so much that it creates addiction.My conclusion is that this film is nothing but a work of art. Although it's in a key of comedy, it reaches the excellence necessary to be a masterpiece. It's very difficult for a comedy to reach that point. The Odd Couple and The Sting are another two examples.My rating: 10 out of 10.",Back to the Future
335,mmuggi,A wonderful classic,10,28 July 2020,"This is the first time I see this classic, and although I'm not a fan of time travel movies, I have to say that this classic is a great example.The film is a time travel science fiction comedy with elements of family film. The film's cast is eminent, and although Michael J. Fox was busy due to his lead role in Family Ties, he plays amazingly in this film. This is even though he approximately only slept for a few hours each night for several months. Christopher Lloyd is just as brilliant as Dr. Emmett Brown and Crispin Glover, who otherwise at the time suffered an awful lot of stage fright, play wonderfully, though some of his scenes had to be changed in post where his dialogue had to be added.It was not originally Michael J. Fox who was to play Marty McFly, but instead Eric Stolz, who, however, brought a darker McFly to the table, something that Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale were not fans of. This resulted in quite a few reshoots, but thank goodness for that, as the end result is amazing.There are some special effects that are very dated, especially the iconic flames after the first demonstrative time travel, just as the film's release also required extreme precision, almost a tooth too much for it to be ""believable"".The film is funny and charming, and Pepsi must have earned the box office after the film became a classic. It has even been named the 56th best screenplay by the Writers Guild of America. It was also the first movie ever to feature a Delorean DMC-12.There were several ideas for the script of the film, which fortunately did not turn into anything.There are a few flaws, such as that the car never gets a scratch despite several collisions and the fact that Doc would never have been able to get into the car when it was standing in the truck, as the doors open vertically, and that one simply could not get a bulletproof vest that can protect against bullets from an AK-47. Doc should therefore be dead.However, the film has so much charm, humor and nostalgia about it that it ultimately ends up as a decided gem.",Back to the Future
336,Marx_Bros_Fan86,One of the best 80's movies,9,18 July 2008,"The majority of 80's comedies have aged very poorly. They are not all necessarily bad, but they have a distinct 80's feel. This is not as much of a problem with Back to the Future, probably because a large part of it does not take place in the 80's! Although it does have more of an 80's feel than its sequels, I think Back to the Future will be enjoyed by audiences for many more years to come. The film has a wonderful blend of comedy, science fiction, and action so that it works on many different levels. Robert Zemeckis and the crew were able to create a perfect 1950's atmosphere, with great sets, 50's music, and 50's television shows.Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents a time machine out of a Delorean (a perfect choice for its futuristic look). Marty travels back to the year 1955 and accidentally prevents his father from meeting his mother, endangering his own existence. He must enlist the help of a younger Doc Brown to repair the time machine and get his parents together before he literally disappears! Things go awry when Biff (Thomas Wilson), the bully who controls George McFly's life, interferes with Marty's plans at every turn.The relationships between these characters really elevate this film above its sequels. Lloyd and Fox have terrific chemistry and are always a riot in every scene together. Crispin Glover is hilarious as the nerdy George McFly, and Lea Thompson is a delight as Lorraine Banes, Marty's mother. Marty's scenes with his parents remind us that our parents were once teenagers too. Marty learns that he has more in common with his parents than he thought. He has the same fears as his father and his mother's rebellious spirit. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty that should be disgusting, but Thompson's charm and Fox's awkwardness make it hilarious.I should devote some credit to the film's special effects and action scenes. In order to go forward in time, Marty and Doc have to harness the energy from a bolt of lightning and channel it into the flux capacitor (which makes time travel possible) while driving the Delorean at 88 miles per hour. This sequence remains one of the most exciting scenes I have ever watched, in large part due to Alan Silvestri's score, and I love how they were able to give the clock tower a significant role in every Back to the Future movie. The time machine going back in time is just as impressive today.Back to the Future is my favorite film by Robert Zemeckis, and I doubt he will top it.",Back to the Future
337,SPaS,Great 80s' montage! (spoilers),10,13 April 2003,"Back to the future is perhaps the best fantasy/comedy/adventure flick to date! And a great 80s' montage, as well (God, is this really almost 20 years old??). Along, with, of course  ""Gremlins"", ""Ghostbusters"", John Hughes' movies and ""Miami Vice""... But what makes this movie special is, that it seems to have aged a lot less than the other movies of its time - which is a tremendous achievement keeping in mind that this movie somewhat ""boasted"" with its time-travel special effects. The trick is, effects shouldn't manipulate the movie. Zemeckis was a genius ahead of his time, too many directors haven't learnt this lesson even yet. Why don't they make movies LIKE THIS anymore? Just set a likeable character (college kids seem to work well) in a predicemen, and let him work and stumble - the balance is essential; needs to be comedic, but not a farce - his way out of it through a 1000 minor and major situations and setbacks. All right, this guy ""grows up to be"" an unlikely hero, but do NOT reward him too much in the end (yeah, yeah, ""rolemodels for the kids"", blah blah. There is a surplus of ""educational"" movies, no need to to be ramming it down everybodys' throats every possible chance!). And do NOT forget the darker issues, even a little grown-up material. Only the really-really-unimportant side characters are to be card-board stereotypes. Special effects come LAST. Keep up the pace, etc etc.BTTF can also boast with its pace: comedic stuff from the starts and about a dozen ""endings"": great sentimental peak when George FINALLY punches Biff->We move to Marty having to play the guitar->the kissing scene (with a delay and a twist)->Johnny B. Goode-> and only THEN we move to ""going home"" with its problems- more than just a few plus running against the clock... and yet, after the ""happy end"" we're left with a great closing scene! Talk about a roller-coaster-ride! Your hands squeezing the nearest pillow. ANY more suspense or action and you'd and up a nerve-rack. Action, adventure and comedy, fitting for all ages. If you don't like this movie, there there just has to be something really wrong with you.",Back to the Future

The film follows Marty McFly as he has traveled to 1955 and must find a way to travel back to 1985. This is without a doubt the best time travel movie in the history of time travel movies. I love the imagination that it took Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis came up with in creating this masterpiece. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored with it. This is how you do a time travel movie. If you want to make a good time travel movie all you need is a good screenplay, music, special effects, acting, the whole nine yards. And this movie delivers and makes time travel sound easy as it breaks it down simple for the audience to understand. Back to the Future makes me want to go to back to a time where everything was simple that we didn't have smartphones or technology that we have now. This is how you do a science fiction movie without being confusing for the audience. I can watch this movie over and over again and not get bored out of my skull. It also makes me want to go to in time when I haven't even heard of this movie and tell my future self to explore this masterpiece.

341,Cephyran,I guarantee you will like this movie...,9,15 November 2004,"I really like this movie. I mean, I really like this movie. I probably first saw it when I was about ten, and it was the coolest thing I'd seen. The concept of time travel is always intriguing, and Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd seem to have an unbeatable 'student and mentor' chemistry on screen. The story is very well-constructed, too. Marty (Fox) is asked to join doc Brown (Lloyd) for a test run of his new time machine, and through an unfortunate series of complications, Marty ends up in the year 1955. To top things off, he may have accidentally set history in a new direction - one that results with him never being born. Not only is the movie fun to watch and well-written, but it just has the atmosphere. A lot of the good movies have it. Its almost a state of mind where you really get into the movie; you can feel the characters going through their conflicts, and you break through that barrier that says ""This is fiction.""Back to the Future is definitely in my top favorite 25 movies ever, and I adamantly recommend this to fans of the genre, the cast...really, a fan of anything will like it, just because it has so much.",Back to the Future
342,danjakubik,"Original, imaginative, clever and highly entertaining.",9,31 March 2010,"I have fond memories of seeing ""Back to the Future"" for the first time when first released during the summer of 1985. The audience I saw it with actually applauded at the end of the film, which is rare for a movie. I remember coming back to see it five more times that summer. Yes, it was only ""just a movie"", but such an original, clever, imaginative, heartwarming, charming movie. One that is very enjoyable and relate-able to a wide audience. ""Back to the Future"" made a big, positive impression on me. I realized I had seen a special, unique film, that might stand the test of time, which it has. I've seen this film many times since 1985 and it has never failed to lift my spirits. It's simply one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.""Back to the Future"" was the product of the imagination of director Robert Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale. The story idea was in genesis for several years. This was the third film of Zemeckis, after ""Use Cars"", 1982 did poor box office and ""Romancing the Stone"", 1984 became a minor hit.Marty McFly is an average 80's teenager who accidentally gets sent back in time and interferes with the meeting of his mother and father, jeopardizing his very existence. A simple premise, but one really well thought out and done with imagination and heart. It's part comedy, part action-adventure, part science fiction and part drama. All together, a very entertaining and enjoyable film with great appeal.Here's where Zemecicks first showed what would become one of his trademarks: using the same characters in the same setting of different times. This playful manner with history that would fully develop in the visual effect techniques of ""Forrest Gump"", 1994.""Back to the Future"" is really not much of a visual effects film. What sets ""Back to the Future"" apart is, that it focuses on story, characters and circumstances, in a playful, clever and imaginative manner.For science minded viewers, it's the first a time travel film got most of the physics correct about time travel. It broke the old designs of past time travel movies. Here, energy is used to crack open the space time continuum and the trip through time occurs in a fraction of a second.There's some surprisingly heartwarming and charming moments between the main and supporting characters, such as Marty and Doc saying goodbye and Marty talking to his mother and father at the dance after they've been reunited. All the characters and situations are very relate-able, which is part of the films' appeal.Zemecicks knew he had a small film here, so he requested and received a big, rousing, traditional style film music score from Alan Sylvestri. The climax and epilogue/twist ending of the film were especially memorable and engaging. ""Back to the Future"" was a critical hit and an enormous box office success, that really launched Zemecicks as a prominent director. The film stayed at number one for 11 weeks, which is the third best ever performance for any movie. It received four Academy Award nominations, the most important and nomination being for Best Original Screenplay. I'm happy this film has stood the test of time to be appreciated and enjoyed by a new generation. In 2007, ""Back to the Future"" was added to the National Film Registry as a film of historic or cultural significance. My personal favorite line: ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything"".",Back to the Future

I got some reviews (and I know it was more of a landmark when it first came out) so I watched it again. It was getting a perfect '10' everywhere I went. So just yesterday I watched the whole thing again, and enjoyed it a lot more. It was more funny, more entertaining, and plain better. Maybe I hadn't been in the mood for it the first time. But I was now and it was good; mixing cheeky humour with action and tension: sure it's a good film. But nowhere near perfect.

345,tml_pohlak_13,One of the most fun-to-watch films to date,10,26 June 2009,"Christopher Lloyd stars alongside Michael J. Fox in the fantastic Back to the Future. Essentially, the plot revolves around time travel— Marty McFly (Fox) goes back in time, messes around, and accidentally causes his mother to fall in love with him instead of his father. He has to fix his mistake or else he may be wiped out from existence.Robert Zemeckis was the perfect man to direct this film. In it, I couldn't help detecting some of the spirit of Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (one of my favourite movies). This movie can be thrilling or exciting, but the key element throughout is fun. This is simply a fun film to watch. Cultures from the 80s and 50s clash, Marty discovers his prudish mother was once a teenager like him too, and in general, the film proves to be enjoyable.The film's music (a fantastic score composed by Alan Silvestri) really epitomizes the spirit of fun that permeates the film. Its triumphant tones at certain key moments are not obtrusive; instead of adding to the awareness that one is watching a movie, it seems to engross the viewer even more.I will freely admit that the film's outcome is evident from the very beginning. However, the road that takes the audience there is full of fun, unexpected twists and turns.The Verdict: Plain, old-fashioned fun, and it can be the topic of discussion for hours (although I've avoided it here for spoiler purposes). A great movie.Overall Rating: 10/10",Back to the Future

Back To The Future is a master piece concept which is also ful of fun but yet there was grossness and absence of ""extraordinary"" in the script.I am sure the director never thought that this movie can be such a success and that is why he never paid much attention to make it overwhelmingly smart, appropriate and courageous. No doubt one can enjoy the trilogy and feel satisfied but i see a lot of doors left open untouched which if were cared, would have given the shape of metropolis to the grandeur. The movie is awesome but not beneficial or thought provocative. I rated it less for miss or less-using and then stabilizing the special concept which leaves no ground open in the viewers to allow something scientific and technically correct. Being a great person it becomes responsibility to take care of many aspects for others which i didn't find in this movie.The amazing points of the movie includes two characters, the guy and the scientist, the most fitting comic faces to let you understand that whatever you are going to watch is going to be enjoyable. Next is the memorable vehicle that can travel in time. Third is the amazing area and landscape used to avoid the time travel giving clumpsy look. That is something intelligent film making.",Back to the Future

This is a film where anything is possible and what every single person has once dreamt about.....embarking on time travel.This an enjoyable and satisfying film about a teenage boy (Marty) being forced to go back in time using the iconic flux capacitor invented by Emmet ""Doc"" Brown. While Marty is back in time he inavertely changes the future which includes him never existing.Not only is this a nostalgic snapshot of what the 50's used to be like, its also a vivid juxtaposition of time periods (50's and 80's). It has clever and slick references to the differences in the 50's to the 80's and how naive people were.Is this an epic masterpiece? No, but its a big achievement in cinema because it brings a lot of peoples impossible dreams alive. This is probably one of the greatest comedies ever and is definitely Micheal J fox's best film so far. 9/10 A must see",Back to the Future

I can understand its pioneering qualities, but now it seems dilluted, when put alongside other good works on same general topic. Spielberg had his magic, but after a while, got repetitive. Looking back, it seems clear that he tried to recapture the nostalgia of his childhood, the things those kids dreamt and imagined, which is fine in itself, but gets you only so far. The standard small town, people, relationships (popular kids, loner, bullying, lifelong archenemies) somehow feel museum like today. Without the drop of nostalgia, the movie is more like a framework of childish memories of times that are no longer and feels... Boring.

What a trip down Memory Lane!Back to the Future is a brilliant movie. Teenager Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) accidentally travels back in time in a car his friend Doc Brown had invented - shortly after Brown is murdered by Libyan terrorists. He meets the younger Doc and convinces him that he is a genuine time traveler. But while they figure out a way to send Marty back to the future, they realise that Marty accidentally interfered with his parents' first meeting - endangering his own existence. They must not only work on returning Marty back to 1985 (he went back to 1955), but they must get Marty's parents to fall in love.The movie's brilliantly scripted. It's very funny. The acting is good. And the effects (when used) are quite good. To quote one critic's praise, ""It wastes very little in the way of dialogue"". EVERYTHING that's said is put in there on purpose. Pay close attention throughout the film. It's hugely fun to watch. A true masterpiece.",Back to the Future
365,charlieoso,Great Scott!,9,19 November 2018,"Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wrote a screenplay back in the 80s that was having troubles getting made. Due to earlier projects such as I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND, 1941 and USED CARS all did not light up the box office. Once Zemeckis made ROMANCING THE STONE people in Hollywood were looking more at this writing duo and their projects. Thank God, because this was one of the best trilogies ever made!Within the first 10 minutes or so of this film we see Marty McFly (excellently played by Michael J. Fox) back in 1985. He has a super-dorky dad (Cripsin Glover), drunk mom (Lea Thompson) and two older siblings (Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber) who are no longer at high school, but still live at home. Not to mention his band The Pinheads were silenced at an audition for being just too darn loud. At my prom it would have been amazing to have them rock the night away. After we see the first 10-15 minutes of the film it really does start to pick up and we are introduced to his friend Doc Brown (wickedly played by Christopher Lloyd and could be his best part in his career). He has just invented a new time machine. To make a long story short McFly ends up in the time machine and travels back to 1955 when his parents were in high school. So, he has to meet the younger Doc Brown and have him send him back to the future. At the same time not trying to meet his parents or screw up their relationship in any way.This really is a terrific sci-fi/comedy from 1985 that lets your imagination soar, laughter fly and emotions ride. Spawned two sequels that were also great. Also has quite an amazing score by Alan Silvestri that is in fact one of my favourites. Also has some great original tunes by Huey Lewis & the News.Also starring Thomas F. Wilson who is amazing as the bully Biff and his three thug friends J.J. Cohen, Casey Siemaszko and Billy Zane. Totally a need-to-see for anyone who likes a little bit of sci-fi, because even though it is really based on time travel the sci-fi elements are not overwhelming. I have watched this and its sequels endless times over the years since I first seen it over 30 years ago. Highly recommended.",Back to the Future

368,Ingrouille181,"One of the Classics, and one of the best sci-fi adventure movies of all time",10,19 March 2019,"I can't believe it took me until my college days for me to finally watch this movie. This is one of the all time classics for sci-fi fans, adventure fans, movies in general, and I'm in that same group. An extraordinary film that I would put up there with Shawshank, or A New Hope, or The Last Crusade. It is so well crafted, directed, paced and acted. At no point in the movie do I feel bored, or check my watch, I'm engaged the whole way through and I'm always waiting for more.The story, for those who don't know, focuses on a rebellious teenager named Marty McFly, who, after discovering that his friend, the slightly mad Dr. Emmeett Brown, has discovered time travel, turning his DeLorean into a time machine, is forced to escape after Brown is seemingly killed in a hit and run, sending him 30 years back in time to the 1950's. Once there, he seeks out the younger Doc Brown, needing to find a way Back to the Future. Along with that, he discovers the teenage versions of both his parents Lorraine and George, and after ruining his parents' first meeting, soon discovers he needs to get them together before he and his siblings all disappear forever.Though there are a LOT of different character arcs, they all work themselves into the plot greatly and make it even more enjoyable and engaging to watch. Along with the characters, we get the main villain, Biff Tannen, the typical 80's jock bully who keeps getting in the way. It's funny seeing Marty accidentally getting his own mother infatuated with him as a teenager, and desperately trying to get her with his father George, who as a teenager is the typical nerdy, socially inept dweeb, and watching Marty help him find his confidence.Not to mention that the score is phenomenal, on par with the Star Wars theme, the Indiana Jones theme or the Jurassic Park theme. When you hear it, you instantly remember stuff like the DeLorean, Doc Brown, the 80's.This is one of my favourite movies, and I'm giving it a 10 out of 10.

I wouldn't take up too much space with my comment, just that ""Back to the Future"" is very well-paced, well-acted, well-written and very interesting. In addition to all that, it's hilarious. Plainly put, it's the perfect popcorn movie for a boring Saturday night, and just about whenever one feels listless and wants to be entertained. I really liked Doc.

370,johnmschofield,A splendid comedy romp,10,26 December 2009,Sometimes a film comes along and the timing of its release turns out to be absolutely perfect and in my opinion this is one of those films. Everything about this film feels right and it is nearly two hours of inventive comedy and pretty much anything else you would want from a really entertaining creation. All of the people involved in the making of this film should be congratulated on a job well done. I always enjoy watching it again and I will never lose my enthusiasm for this film. The film could have been released five years before or five years after 1985 and for some reason I do not think it would have had the same effect. We will never know but suffice to say that it is a splendid romp that does not fall into the trap of being too serious and therefore works remarkably well. I would recommend this film to anyone providing they are prepared to tune into the humour and if that happens it will be guaranteed to be an enjoyable experience.,Back to the Future
371,ChrisTreborn,"""The CLASSIC MODERNpiece""",10,4 March 2005,"When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE that 80s. IT'S SIMPLY THE GREATEST TIME TRAVEL MOVIE EVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF WORLD CINEMA.I firstly heard about this movie on Discovery channel, I didn't know much about it's importance, even it's title, then one day I happened to read television listings and was struck by a title named ""Back to the Future""..? Man what was that? Months later unexpectedly watch that on AXN channel. WOW, I was thrilled by its idea. Huh,.. I almost lost in that future..Back to the future (Spoilers******) Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".All in all it is the GREATEST SCI-FI, ROAMANTIC MOVIE OF THE ALL TIMES. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A MODERN/CLASSIC MASTERPIECE! """" I gave this movie 10 thumps up out of 10 stars.""",Back to the Future
372,donuthaters12,Zemeckis' Film Is Ambitious And Multi-Generationally Approachable,9,8 December 2013,"Back To The Future is one of those films that is universally loved and is one of the most referenced contemporary films of all time. Has there been any other time travel film that has created such an impact as this film? Not that I have seen, but it is arguable as I have not seen many time traveling films.Back To The Future is written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I am just get this out of the way and say that both are not the greatest of writers but they did have created an a concept that is so ambitious and at the same time so accessible that it is hard to not appreciate their writing contributions. Back To The Future's premise is the reason we watch this film and it's the reason that we keep getting hooked to it. Back To The Future's plot is ambitious, at times too ambitious that certain plot holes may be present in relation to the impact of Marty's influence, and the film also has an abundance of humor scattered throughout the film. The humor is one of the main reason that the film is so accessible and beloved, the jokes can be related to both the younger generation and the previous generation even if either generation is from the 50-80s era. The story of just having Marty's mother be infatuated with him, and lightly touches on Freud's Oedipal Complex, is hilarious and ridiculous that it still has it's effect with every viewing. Back To The Future also manages to create the most unique of friendships, a high school student and a slightly off scientist, because these characters are so well written that I didn't really mind the unbelievability of their friendship. Both writers have created a protagonist that is very close to a real teenager during the 80's and made him so appealing that every adolescent males want to be him and all teenage girls want him.Robert Zemeckis now is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary directors and Back To The Future is one of the reasons why that is so. Zemeckis was able to execute a film that has such an ambitious plot while maintaining a campy coming of age tone that can appeal to a multi-generational audience. Back To The Future and Romancing The Stone definitely made Zemeckis an important director and those become a stepping stone for him to create films with more artistic license. Back To The Future was able to create this sense of nostalgia and walk a tightrope between two generations of adolescence. Zemeckis was able to project that ability to recreate a time of adolescent youth that is relatable and fueled by references that defined that time period; Zemeckis has definitely created something that was similar to what George Lucas did for American Graffiti.Dean Cundey started off as a cinematographer of the most popular Horror films of all time, including Halloween and The Thing. After working with Zemeckis on Romancing With The Stone, he did a complete turn around working in much more light-hearted and optimistic films. Cundey did a decent job here and was able to juxtapose two different looks for the film, the dark and dirty look for the 80s and the warm and colorful look of the 50's. Cundey's photography isn't as in your face with nostalgia, like The Godfather, as it consistently takes a more contemporary style throughout the film. Cundey shoots this film to serve the plot and maintaining that accessibility and light hearted tone that Zemeckis wanted instead of drawing attention to itself. The cinematography for this film may not be as loved as the film's writing or musical score but Cundey doesn't slouch with this film.Alan Silvestri was brought in to compose the score for Back To The Future and what a wonderful job he has done here. Silvestri's score here is one of the most memorable film scores that competes with other films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It has the ability to stick under your skin and will have you bobbing your head when it comes on. Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"" is so catchy that it just stands out and had me singing the lyrics every time it comes on. The song is able to blend in with Silvestri's score which prevents me from drawing too much attention to it and feeling like it's out of place.Michael J. Fox is the star of this film, embodying this character who is a product of a rebellious and erratic generation. Fox brings personality to McFly by acting like how cool teenage adolescents were like in his time period. When he is sent back in time, Fox was able to portray this fish out of water kind of personality and emotion that makes his entrapment believable. Christopher Lloyd plays the slightly intense scientist who has created time traveling. Lloyd definitely has given such a memorable performance and nobody else was able to capture his performance in any other film. Lloyd was able to balance humor and the seriousness with such flourish that he was to place weight in the story of the scene. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover play Marty's parents and both do a very good job and was able to embody both their young and older self, though at times Glover at the start of the film was quite over the top and had me cringing a couple of times. Thomas F. Wilson was good as a cliché looking bully ""Biff"". He was able to give off this toughness quality that is able to make the McFly's feel inferior.Back To The Future by now is regarded as a classic and I can see why. This film will appeal to every generation and it's legacy will continue to grow as time passes. Back To The Future is still Zemeckis' best film and will forever remain as a timeless piece of cinema.",Back to the Future

376,crash21,A classic movie in both Comedy and Sci-Fi,10,15 January 2016,"""Back to the Future"" has to be one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made, including the film's movie trilogy. It was great with the movie soundtracks and the amount of comedy running through the whole thing.The movie has to be everybody's dream at some point, he starts with a family that is partially wrecked by the father's lifelong bully, alongside his friend scientist shot dead, and (by accident) fixes it all in the past. With a lot of amusing comedy moments in between, one of the classic moments was the ""I hate manure"" scenes there were in the whole trilogy.I find it rather sad that most people seem to assume that the DeLorean car in this was just a special car made for the film, because that car was actually a more efficient car made in the 80's. Kind of like 80's version of today's Toyota Prius. Too bad the movie didn't get the DeLorean more popularly bought.Oh well, ""Back to the Future"" is a great movie, and to prove this, it is still a popular movie even today.",Back to the Future
377,AsifZamir,Would you trade everything to go back in time?,10,21 November 2013,"Back to the Future is the first movie in a series of 3. The film was written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. The film's origins stemmed from musings by Gale in that he wondered if he were to go to high school with his father, if they would have gotten along (Vs. what most Canadian boys think about ""gosh I wonder who my father is""). The movie went on to production only after Zemeckis' Romancing the Stone, as it was previously rejected before-hand. Back to the Future was produced through Universal Pictures by Steven Spielberg.Back to the Future is about a teen, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), who lives at home with his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson), father George (Crispin Glover) and siblings Dave and Linda (Marc McClure and Wendie Jo Sperber). With the unintentional aid of eccentric friend, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), Marty is sent back to the time of his parent's teenage years in a time machine that is powered by Plutonium. Marty then has to bring his parents together again while diverting his mother's romantic interest in Marty, making it very awkward, so he and his siblings would still exist.Back to the Future was the biggest movie for the year of 1985. Back to the Future was an all-time kids favourite and also enjoyed by adults, as I still watch the movie from time to time and thoroughly enjoy it.

378,antimatter33,Perfect in every way,10,23 September 2020,"Movies are, lets face it, supposed to be fun now and then. And this movie is, from start to end, fun, fun in all its forms, stupid fun, silly fun, love fun, fight fun, woo fun, it is just damned fun. You get a smile about a minute into it and it never leaves your face.But behind the fun is a deeper realm. Roger Ebert made the deep observation that this film is very much in the mold of Frank Capra, and in fact is very comparable to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", in which a life is reconsidered after magical intervention. In that film, although it is never quite stated, the main character is a rather faithless actor, and prone to self-pity and self-indulgence. Only by being shown his lesser side is he redeemed. That's a very Puritan message. At then end, one feels a little chagrined after a few viewings, to realize that there is this subtext of the role of will and the nature of sin. I didn't quite believe that George Bailey would not backslide into his dreamer self, and make life miserable again for his family. And in BTTF, Marty McFly and his formerly interesting family members are converted into 80s consumer drones, which also leaves one with a feeling of uncertainty about what has just been experienced.Oh - sorry about that - I was just thinking out loud. The script is great, the editing is great, the acting is great, the attitude is great, it's just perfect, a perfect movie, in tune with its time and slyly observant of 80s culture (well, suburban culture).

Now (Spring, '00) she has been cast as a lead in a resuscitation of ""Cabaret"" for the stage.  I can't help but think this role helped in her selection based on her ability to project character.Overall, this will rank right up there with Breakfast Club as an example of '80s ensemble flicks.  But, unlike B.C., will never be tiring to watch over and over.",Back to the Future

I can't really see why anyone wouldn't like this film, it is a perfect family film. All of the back to the future films are great and enjoyable.

Frequency, a more latest time-bending film, deals with an orphaned son who fears not to live up to the expectations of his father; Back to the Future plays with his parents ' filial disappointment or disillusionment.On the surface, Marty McFly (in a physically and comedically deft performance, Michael J. Fox) has sufficient reason for disappointment: for his over-losing parents (and brothers) he seems far too cool, although he does not know how he really is the son of his father.But when a time travel experiment organized by Marty's friend Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in an Einstein-esque fright wig) leaves Marty stranded in the 1950s, Marty finds a side he never knew of his parents.The story is so tightly planned, with almost everything setting up something else and it pays off, that especially after numerous viewings, the first half can come off a bit gimmicky and artificial. But the last act is so overwhelmingly satisfying that it makes up more than any artificiality or artificiality.Although the film takes for granted unchaste conduct as the norm among adolescents both in the 1950s and today, Marty's dismay at the unexpectedly risky conduct of his mother indicates, ironically, that despite everything else, kids still want their parents to have a greater standard.The filmmakers followed up with a couple of back-to-back sequels initially designed as one film and that way should have been left.Part II is highly uneven, with a wonderful third act in which Marty returns to 1955 partially compensating for a wobbly opening, set in the future, and excessively nasty middle act set in a 1985 alternative. Part III is a bit loose in the old west and has some gaping holes in the plot. They might be worth watching once or twice, but it's worth going back to the original again and again.",Back to the Future
383,ADOZER200,Original Classic,10,2 May 2002,This movie deserves to be amongst the classics. Michael J. Fox did outstanding and who could ever forget Christopher Lloyd in his role as Doc. He made me think that there actually was a real Doc. Both actors are excellent along with Crispin Glover playing George McFly. Glover does very well in his roles. I would like to see him in better movies. I chose the sequel over the original though. The reason being that the sequel involved new stuff and a bit of the original stuff. This movie should not be forgotten. There wont be one like it. Im surprised the delorium wasnt sold out at the time. were they that badly made?,Back to the Future
384,Jules45,25 years on and it could still teach so many films so many lessons.,10,1 November 2010,"Back in the decade of 'In space no-one can hear you scream', Lightsaber swashbuckling Jedi and of course Arnold Schwarzenegger cradling that not so delicate pump-action, bad-ass necessity; it seemed only appropriate to throw time travel in the mix of a genre that was starting to expand more and more with some good ol' computer technology, which back then, didn't have to become the primary tool in a directors box of apparatus.So when Back to the Future spurted the fiery paths of tire grinding, followed by a once handsome DeLorean turned four wheeled ice block, the questioned was: what made it so much different, better, cooler? Simply, whereas other sci-fi's that demonstrated so effortlessly the compulsive need to slap audiences jaw drop levels further down to the ground, explosion by explosion, Back to the Future arguably took a more humour through simplicity approach.Example, body language. Nothing that will be spoilt of course, but the deliberate motions of characters (especially in the diner) can tell an audience all they'd need to know about a character, before their identity was fully revealed through this interaction. Funny, yes. But not till it scratches the surface more deeply do things start to get more than standard slapstick, especially where family is concerned.That doesn't mean the film lacked, an albeit Michael Bay need for some wanted explosions and top techno talk to remind us throughout it was a sci-fi (""1.21 gigawatts? 1.21 gigawatts? Great Scott!""), and hadn't took the 'Humour of his mum fancying him' path too far and sloppily. If anything, science is more of a focus than anything else.Not for the obvious fact it's a science fiction (Bravo) but more that Marty is as confused with 'Docs' long winded trails of scientific calculations with himself as we are. And ironically, he understands the ins and outs so easily his madness seems ordinary. It's all Marty's dumbfound confusion and the audiences comfort of knowing 'We never need to know what on earth a Flux Capacitor is so let's go along with it'. This all makes the baffling intellect more of a reassurance everything will work, rather than a panicky and frantic turn of heads to understand every little detail as to not get lost in its 'family friendly' plot. And that's what it's all about. It never needs to go into drawn out explanations that only scientific universities would host, it's a thrill ride, Marty's ride, our ride; with two more stops yet to go.",Back to the Future

It is not the case, and it remains a solid family value entertainment... the sort of films you can expect your kids to watch over and over again. I suppose the whole skateboard and matchmaking your mum and dad must be part of the timeless magic of the script.So only one thing to do: buy a collector's three film box set and you'll know what sound investment means when they have been watched 20 times plus and your kids ask if they can watch it AGAIN.",Back to the Future

Brown is shot by people with guns, in a hurry Marty gets into the car and drives away, but because of the fact that it is A TIME MACHINE! He is sent back to the 1950's. He ends up accidentally stopping his parents from falling in love, the Doc Brown of the 50's tells Marty that he must fix them up, of he will cease to exist. The lines and characters of Marty, Doc Brown, and Biff are very likable and-or memorable. Some of the lines that these 3 characters say are some of the most memorable lines. Since ""No Luke, I am your father."" The acting in this motion picture, although not Oscar worthy, is in fact fact great. Michale J.

So, after a decade and a half last week I've decided to see it again, and man was it a cold shower.OK, let's be honest, Back To The Future films are meant to be a fictional comedy and you can't expect any complexity or dramatic twist. A cool kid with ambition and a classical nutty professor type join their forces in a time traveling adventure. Sounds like a cool plot for the 12-15 generation, but that's as far as it goes. I still find it entertaining yet the simpleness of the whole story does kill the excitement a bit. Also, the commercial aspect of the movies is insultingly obvious. Come on... Pepsi, Delorean, Nike, Toyota... it all shouts of sponsorship and it's placed without any effort of subtleness. It's like the whole budget was dependent on the good fortunes of the sponsors, thus making a movie into an expensive and long commercial. Overall, entertaining, relaxing but that's about it.And another thing. This is not SF!Science Fiction - Fiction based on scientific facts. Flux Capacitor and time traveling dogs are hardly supported by science. Very few films dubbed SF fulfill the standards overall. Adventure, fantasy, comedy, fiction... ""Back To The Future"" is all those things, but SF it ain't!",Back to the Future
392,amraampk,one day quite a long time from now it will become a reality,10,7 January 2010,"1986 may be the month of July when i was at vacation form my school my bros brought this film home. For the first time i saw Michael.J.Fox , at that time i enjoyed the movie but not that much until when i turned 18 this very same movie was aired on a local channel here in my home town Lahore-Pakistan. At time i was able to understand the subject matter of the Hollywood movies better. That was so funny and also enjoyable watching but imagining your self traveling through time to same place and location where you belong 30 years backward the time in which you don't even exist. Then suddenly you happen to meet your own father who is same old you are now (shocking to unbelievable extant) than ending up inside a home being unconscious lights turns on , a young lady taking care of you sits in front of you ,you scream and become speechless because she will give you birth as your own mother. Meeting than your own grand parents and also meeting especially your youngest maternal uncle who is just a baby but in the future he will become a symbol of humiliation for whole family. Michael.J.Fox now tries to bring closer his parents together , but in a new manner as his future father is quite a weak personality and under confidant ,his mother was inside regretting her decision of marrying him ,another problem is their course met who is after her mother he is kind of jerk and also want to be dominating as his ancestors. But the most funny thing is that his mother falls for him (her own future son she does not know yet). On the other hand i found the most funny but cute character Christopher Lloyd the man who invented the time machine, he introduces Michael Fox to the machine(another funny thing , his dog name is Einstien). My whole family and circle of friends admired it very much and even it became popular in our country(it was also presented in theaters in 86-87), some people here were wondering is it possible. In the future it could be but it demands a lot of energy of solar stars ,BBC once predicted in sci-fi program hosted by X-files Gillian Anderson But it will take years maybe centuries till then keep on enjoying and imagining such cute fantasies.",Back to the Future

The main character Marty Mcfly is a friendly,likable funny guy who's family isn't the greatest, His father is a loser who lack confidence and is always picked on by Biff who is a nasty person who only thinks for himself. His Mother is a drinker and is never really happy or upbeat. His brother also has a lame job in delivering pizzas.Marty is told by Doc brown (who is really funny and interesting) that he has made a time machine into a car. Marty then travels back in time from 1985 to 1955 because of being in a tight problem after the doc gets killed by a bunch of gang members. I won't tell you what happens in the rest of the story but it's something you have to see to believe. The writing in the film is tight and I can watch this film many times without getting bored and finding new things within the film that I have missed the first few times I watched it. It's a film that anybody can enjoy.The first film in the series will always be the best and while the 2nd and 3rd movies were very good follow ups. This movie will always be the best one.

395,DragonMasterHiro,"""Make like a tree, and get outta here.""",10,3 July 2003,"Timeless. One of the most amazing adventures brought to the big screen. Anytime this movie comes on TV or someone else is watching it, I find myself watching too even though I've seen it practically 20 times already. There are just so many great characters and the plot takes hold of you because it's exciting and humorous. *SPOILERS* Everything fits together so nicely in this movie: the fantasy of time travel, a cool car, dire circumstances, a good villain, a variety of roles, great music (by Huey Lewis & the News) and so many great scenes! You've got Doc and Marty testing out the DeLorean and being attacked, people mistaking Marty for an alien, when Marty first arrives in town in the past and finds Doc, getting hit by the car and waking up next to his mom, the clock tower scene...they're all great! I think Marty McFly is one of the best movie heroes of all time. There's no super powers, easy way to escape or higher beings at work.  It's just him trapped in the 50's with nothing but his wits.  He's just an ordinary kid with big aspirations but plenty of quirks. Doc Brown is just plain crazy but goodhearted. Biff Tannen is the best example of the thick headed bully. The whole movie is intense since if Marty takes too much time to get his parents together, then he will fade away forever. Of course, in trying to make things right, Marty messes up here and there and constantly has to fix it!What we have today simply does not compare to movies like this one. Sure, maybe they do big numbers at the box office for one weekend, but none of them will stand the test of time. They even managed to make the sequel, Back to the Future II (another great one) which wasn't a bomb like most sequels. They also made Back to the Future III which wasn't as good, but in my opinion this one was the best in the trilogy.""When this baby hits 88 miles an hour, you're gonna see some serious sh*t!"" - Doc",Back to the Future

You can't go far without someone spouting out its memorable dialogue and imitating its wonderful characters. Now that it's over twenty years old, Back to the Future is entertaining a whole new generation.It has a simple enough story that involves a teenager who longs for a better life and the crazy scientist friend who builds a time machine. When the scientist's unveiling of a time machine made out of a DeLorean goes awry, the teenager ends up accidentally going back in time thirty years. While he's there he sees all of the people he knows from 1985, except they're now thirty years younger.A genius story like that creates an excellent movie and a star making performance by Michael J. Fox as the teenager. The highlight of this movie comes from the scientist played by Christopher Lloyd. His whacky antics were perfect for the role and made the character of Doc Brown immediately come to life.Some viewers today may think that an '80s movie that ends up becoming a '50s movie won't be for them.

Honestly, an excellent use of my time.I loved the story. It had a very interesting plot fueled by original and entertaining characters. To sum it up, a kid gets sent to the past on an unplanned trip via a time machine constructed by his eccentric inventor friend. I don't want to give away any more than that. This is truly one of the best films to come from the '80s. It's colorful, exciting, funny, and filled with a gold mine of amazing '80s lines. The music went with the film perfectly, of course, just fun music when it was a good time, and music to work up the audience when stress was needed. Director Zemeckis did a great job. I could watch this movie again and again. It had no low points, no slowing down. It was genuinely interesting the entire way through.My only problem is one prevalent in many films: overactive coincidence. Sometimes the conflicts were resolved way too easily, and I felt really unsatisfied. Maybe I was taking it too seriously, maybe I was expecting too much, I don't know, but a few moments of the film I was disappointed. No worries though, because the greatness of the film made me forget the hiccups. I still thing it's a super fun ride.This is a perfect movie for family movie night, or hanging out with friends, anything. I can't think of a scenario where viewers wouldn't have a good time watching this movie, except for stuffy, boring people who have no imagination who perhaps just came from a funeral, or something like thatbut you probably shouldn't be watching any movies with people just coming from such a sad event, and you probably shouldn't be hanging out with boring people anywayso yeah, I stand by what I said.

403,BobbyT24,MUST-SEE!!!! This is better in 2015 than when it came out in 1985...,10,3 August 2015,"I've watched this movie so many times, I can quote the entire movie. I'm not giving anything away by saying it was/is still ahead of it's time. Although the characters' belief that 2015 would be significantly different than our current 2015 actually IS, is irrelevant (actually, it's a comedy so the guesses at reality just makes it funnier!). Robert Zemeckis directed a legendary movie mocked and satirized in many movies afterward. That's the highest praise a picture can garner. This is as near-to-perfection as screen comedy/time travel gets in my book.To put the writing/directing in perspective, I will tell you what my screen writing teacher said about this movie a few years ago when she screened just the opening sequence for our class... She said the opening sequence of nearly five minutes long with few editing breaks sets the stage for what is to come. She said this was how professional screenwriters dream about opening a movie. It's just... flawless. The opening reveals layer upon layer of story themes with very few words, just visuals and a few key noises in the background. Without a single actor in the midst. It's just the setting and a moving camera. We have just been treated to circa-1985 without ever even seeing an actor walking across screen. THEN the actor walks in. It only gets better from there. Magnificence in direction.Watching it again last night made me realize how special of a movie it really was. I simply enjoyed the experience. It transported me back to 1985 all over again. Knowing everything there is to know about the story. And it STILL makes me laugh. The fact they set it in 1985 was a stroke of genius. People in 2015 can only joke about what they believed the future would look like. But the writers/director so very wisely chose to say ""1985"" and not ""Present Day"" -- a date-reference killer once a movie reaches an age where current present day looks nothing like the movie we're watching. That 1985 date also allows for a perfect anchor to bounce around in the future two sequels in the series.I remember watching this in the theater when it was first run in - yes, I was there - 1985. My best friend sitting next to me in the theater watched Michael J Fox stumble along 1955 Main Street and his comment at that moment in the movie was, ""Nobody could play this character better than Michael J Fox."" I have to agree. MJF IS Marty McFly personified. He carries the picture effortlessly and heroically, along with the hilarious and severely underrated Christopher Lloyd as the genius/basket case, Dr. Emmitt Brown. Two genius actors playing off one another, along with the perfect supporting cast, makes this a must-watch movie at any time in history. It is genuinely funny, sweet, nostalgic, witty, beautiful, and exciting. Every scene has something to do with another scene. There is literally not a single wasted frame in this movie. Later episodes of the series aren't as perfect as BTTF1 but that's a different story... If anyone ever creates a time-capsule, PLEASE make sure to include this movie. Future millennia of species will enjoy it too. :-)If you haven't watched ""Back to the Future"" before, regardless of your age or generation, please reward yourself with this near-perfect time-travel comedy. I loved it even more this time around. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. 10 out of 10.",Back to the Future
404,ElmStreetsLastBrat,One of the best 80s comedies,8,11 February 2007,"I love ""Back to the Future"". It definitely is one of the best comedies to be produced in the 80s. Yes, it's cheesy, the special effects are cheesy, the dialogue and the music is so 80s, but it's so much fun to watch! I love this movie. It is one of my favorites. Even though I was born in 1984 I am a huge fan of this movie. Michael J. Fox was perfect for the role. You just gotta love Marty McFly. Christopher Lloyd was perfectly cast as Doc and Lea Thompson was great as Marty's mother. But I think my favorite performance from this film was Crispin Glover, who played Michael J. Fox's father. I found it interesting that when the movie was made, Michael J. Fox was actually three years older than Crispin Glover. And they're playing father and son! Michael J. Fox was 24 and Crispin Glover was 21. Interesting fact! Anyway, Crispin Glover was the perfect nerd. You just had to love George McFly! And you just had to feel sorry for him for getting picked on by Biff all the time. I loved all of Marty's attempts to get his parents together before he was erased from existence while he was back in 1955. I loved how you got to see a perfect depiction of the era of the 1950s, from the cars to the high school to the ice cream shop and then you saw how it looked in the present day 1985. There's even a DeLorean in the film! The cinematography was excellent and the direction was on key and you just loved all the characters. The storyline was interesting too.

Fox was a real role model to look up to in this film. Everything his character was, was something I could relate to in terms of wishing for a better life than that of his previous time existence.It's just a ""REAL"" shame that films like this don't get to be made with the same passion and enthusiasm as before. Try to do yourself the favor of avoiding watching too much commercial crap out there that tries to hard too hard to take after films like this and begin re-live classic films that still know how to please those since childhood.My only dissapoinment about the film was Claudia Welles' character of Jennifer Parker, considering that she didn't bother reprising her role in the next two installments, paving the way for a rather wooden Elisabeth Shue to take over the role.Since the Star Wars trilogy and E.T. can enjoy 20th anniversary re-releases, why not trying to add Back to the Future to the equation.

412,judemcrobbie,A movie for anyone,10,18 February 2021,"This movie has seemingly battled time. And won!
I love this movie so much. The movie bring a funny and heartwarming side to the usually bleak time-travel. Most time travel movies are too caught up on the technical science side, which personally I love a factually correct movie, but it usually can hinder the writing and narrative if this is the case. Look no further than Tenet. I enjoyed Tenet but it does not give our protagonist enough development. Time travel is a means to an end in Back to the Future, so it does not get bogged down in the science of it all, even using that as comical device.
The heartwarming nature is derived from the theme of free will and how our actions can impact and affect those around us in more drastic ways than just on the surface.
Christopher Lloyd (Dr. Emmett Brown) has a natural flare for comedic timing and delivery. Couple that with his excellent acting overall and you get the full performance perfect for the supporting character.
Michael J. Fox (Marty McFly) has a brilliant performance in this, creating a natural chemistry between him and his parents, his girlfriend and most of all Doc. The Doctor and Marty bounce off each so well combining in a terrific all round movie.
Multiple questions of predestination and control of our future are asked through out keeping the movie fresh in your mind for days to come.
A full movie in any right. It could just as easily work a drama, sci-fi or romance, even without the comedy aspect.
There's a true sense if suspense and fear therough the final act, brining that true sense of cinema that can't be witness in very movie and even rarer in a comedy.
The death at the start, this is me not trying to give too much away, is powerful. In spite of not knowing the character and just having met him a few moments ago, through the acting writing and directing, you really connect to this character.
Probably the best comedy ever, it certainly is in my opinion",Back to the Future

Things have changed around Hill Valley in 1955. Well there's a young George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine Baines (Lea Thompson). Things go fine until Biff Tannen (Thomas Wilson) shows up. Now things turn creepy when Emmett Brown does not know Marty in the 50's. They have to get back to 1985 by a bolt of lightning, which it strikes at night. Now they have to get George and Lorraine to the school dance. Now Marty is prepared to back to 1985. Then Emmett was suspecting that Marty was supposed to go back, but he came back from the future.

Back to the Future is one of the most successful films of the 80's, and today no film has done better at keeping you on the edge of your seat, and laughing the entire time. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, an average high school kid of the 1980's who ends up accidentally getting sent back in time to the year 1955 after his friend, Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. Now, trapped in time, Marty has to find a way to get back into his own time. There's more elements to the plot, but I don't want to spoil the entire movie for you. Most people have probably seen this movie at some point in their life, but if you haven't, it's a must see. It has everything you could want from a movie: comedy, action, suspense, and great special effects for it's time. I love Back to the Future.

The performance from Michael J. Fox was memorable. The poster looks really bad-ass. Special effects were not unbelievable. All the characters were likable, even the bad guys.

I think the movie successfully spans the genres of Sci-fi, Comedy and Adventure to come up with an original feel that appeals particularly to teenagers and young adults...After watching Back to the Future Part II for 30 minutes I could already see that it didn't match its predecessor. Repetition was rife and one of the characters (Jennifer) was put to sleep early on, which was surely a sign of a plot lacking direction. Don't think I'll bother watching Part III...I read a review a while ago suggesting that the Back to the Future trilogy was better than the Star Wars trilogy. I have to say, on the basis of what I've seen, I don't agree. Star Wars was an altogether more mature movie experience about life, the universe, and everything.

Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J.

All the old guy wants to do is to perfect time-travel for his own enjoyment...he wants to witness the birth of Christ and the signing of the Declaration of Independence, etc. Brown's only friend is a typical teenager, Marty McFly, who ain't yet sophisticated enough to know trouble when he encounters it. With Doc Brown seriously-wounded, but the Doc's plutonium-driven time-machine-cum-Delorean-sportscar very functional, 17-year-old Marty scrambles to escape murder himself...in fleeing, he goes back to the teen world of the 1950's and finds himself an unadmirable pal, who's actually his dad at age 18. Young ""dad"" is a pushover for bullyboys, he's a clumsy peeping-tom and a depressed, whining escapist who'll probably never amount to anything but a small-town failure. Marty tries to help his future-dad and ends up making matters worse for awhile. Our hero's in an almost-impossible situation and makes us laugh at his misfortune. I'll always stop and watch this almost-great movie whenever it rears it's head on the boob-tube. It's wonderful fun, from the faulty Rube Goldberg mechanics in the first scene, right through development of Doc Brown's hilarious self, then into Marty's frantic sexual unease when his own mother throws herself at him (quite innocently!). I'd thought all time-travel plot possibilities had been exhausted before this movie hit the big screen, but it proved me wrong with all kinds of clever elements, such as no one in the 1950's knowing what TV reruns were, how odd the clothing of 1983 would look to people 30 years back ""What's with the life-preserver, kid? Ya just jump ship?"", or the unfabulous treatment of blacks back in the fabulous 50's. We see an element or two of the future smartly interplayed with the time-travel plot, such as when Marty finds his 19-year-old brother's head missing from an 1980's wallet-photo he carries of his family, foretelling doom to the unborn if Marty doesn't fix what he just screwed up in the past. In 1953, Marty pleads with a much-younger Doc Brown to save his own life, but the ethical scientist refuses. So, we're now mighty sure that Marty is stuck in '53 and that he'll meet himself as a boy when he reaches middle age, or end up in some wild Oedipel-time-warp sexual life of sin. Even that comes off as funny. Naturally, in an adventure-comedy, everything turns out right (almost) in the end. The movie has a message for us, in the last scene. And, unblessedly, the message is a shallow, modern piece of Me-Generation horsedump. It tells us that parents can be ""with it"" if they encourage sexual-immorality in their teenagers, that the accumulation of material wealth and popularity are what matters and that worship of self is the ultimate guarantor of ""success"".

429,panchodh_12,Authentically entertaining,7,20 July 2015,"You should not watch Back to the Future looking for serious, intriguing thought experiments regarding time travel. You should watch it for what it is: a Hollywood blockbuster that seeks to make money through people's entertainment. And the profit-seeking motive is quite clear from the beginning: you see brand placement EVERYWHERE. Back to the Future, then, has all the ingredients for a Hollywood blockbuster: funny characters, unlikely plot denouements that you see coming way before it happens, very cliché characters such as the town bully, the timid nerd that becomes a hero, the damsel in distress. Also, as a 1985 blockbuster, it includes racism and sexism that would probably not be tolerated nowadays, such as the main actor shouting ""the Libyans!"" as a synonym of ""the bad guys!"", or the main character literally planning to abuse of a girl, which happens to be his mother.That being said, the movie does achieve it main goal: it is truly entertaining. I'm not the kind of person who laughs out loud when watching comedies, but in this case I couldn't avoid it. There are truly remarkable situations, especially with Marty's mother. The doctor's character is also particularly well-made, and the actor's performance is notable. In general, the creators did a good job in showing all the different funny situations that would arise from bringing an 80s kid to 1955, such as him playing rock'n roll in front of an awed audience, or Marty saying that a TV program that is just being aired is a classic that he watched in a rerun.So once you understand you shouldn't have high hopes for this movie, and that you should only look for having a good time, this movie will be very satisfactory. There are more artistic movies, better written plots, better directed ones, even funnier ones. But very often, these movies don't remain in the collective imaginary in the way this did it.

The performances are very energetic and are hard to take your eyes off. It's a 116 min roller coaster ride you'll want to get on again once it ends.By the way here's an astonishing story I found online (I'm not sure whether it's true or not): ------------------------------------------------------------ I worked at Amblin' in the 80's when all this went down, and here is what really happened.Bob Zemeckis was given a firm start date by Universal. This was before he had any real power in the business; they said 'you will start on this date or we won't make the picture'. Michael Fox was not technically available, and Universal refused to shoot around his sitcom, so Bob cast Stoltz.Steven Spielberg then told Bob that there was a way to get Fox after all, which was to do this; don't give Stoltz any direction, print the least funny takes, and assemble a rough cut to show Sid Sheinberg and the Universal execs. It was a gamble he was sure would work - the execs would not be pleased, but they would be too far in to back out, and would then acquiesce to shooting around Fox's TV schedule.To Bob's credit, he was uneasy with this approach, but it was a tough time for him. He was struggling with Bob Gale (who also wanted to direct), and going through a rough patch in his marriage, among other things.I've kept my mouth shut over the years because this is how the business works- it's not for the faint of heart.However, I find it a bit reprehensible that they are now making even more profit off this ugly little event by releasing the footage that by design was never meant to be good in the first place.Harvey Keitel shot a considerable amount of Apocalypse Now, but why don't we see Francis Coppola releasing that footage?Because he's got class. The one thing that all the riches in the world cannot buy."" ------------------------------------------------------------Whether the story's true or not, I still think no one could've been better as Marty McFly than Michael J.

436,v_haritha_in,A Refreshing Take on Time-Travel,10,27 August 2014,"Time travel and the possibilities it offered, of altering the past, knowing the future, meeting people/beings from the future, has always fascinated people. Renowned authors from H.G Wells and Isaac Asimov to Charles Dickens have given their interpretation of time-travel. Hollywood too brought out movies like Terminator and the Star Trek franchise. They had all used it on a grand scale, to explore things like ethics and/or future societies. Nobody thought of placing it in a simple high-school setting and using it to comic effect until Back to the Future came along.A teenager, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally transported to 1955 (which is 30 years ago since the present day for this movie is 1985). There he interferes with the moment his high-school-age parents meet, to fall in love later, thereby endangering his own existence. To prevent that from happening, Marty has to play match-maker to his parents. What we have is a very entertaining comedy full of enjoyable characters like the eccentric scientist, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), the school bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) and his sidekicks, Marty's parents, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover) and the school principal Strickland (James Tolkan).

All the lead actors do stellar work and make the trouble that Marty and Emmett get into very believable.OverviewThere are a lot surprises that are both humorous and entertaining. Again the writing is on a level all to its own where one scene snaps perfectly with the next. There never seems to be a moment in time that doesn't connect to a later moment. It is quite brilliant and the transformation from the cast's older to younger selves is really amazing. Mix this with the energy of the soundtrack and this has got to be one of best movies of the 80s if not that of all time. Top marks all around.",Back to the Future

444,Bats_Breath,The film that Proves that Teens never Change,10,11 February 2002,"One thing about teenagers----they can't EVER imagine their own parents were teenagers.  Children maybey, but not teenagers.  Hell they usually forget their older brothers and cousins were teenagers too.  One of the universal truths about being a teenager is that you always think you and people close to your age where the first teens to EVER exist on planet Earth.  Teens always believe that what they are going through is so different from anything anyone else ever went through.  The reality is that 98% of what teens go through, EVERYONE before them went through as well.  Remember the 16, 17 year olds complaining and moaning about how they are different and misunderstood during the Columbine shootings in 1999?  Well they're 20 years old now in 2002, or will be 20 later this year.  So they can't complain about anything anymore.  So why did they complain about being misunderstood? Perhaps now they're adults that are misunderstood? j/king ;) 
In ""Back to the Future"", a typical 17 year old from 1985 is just, well a teenager.  Marty McFly is always late for class, he likes to hang out with his girlfriend at the mall, he's absorbed into his heavy metal music and he doesn't really know too much about what happened in the world more then 4 or 5 years ago.  Marty is self absorbed, but very hip and resourceful.  He's also confident and street smart.  On the other hand, his father George McFly is a complete loser.  George is 47 years old and constantly being bullied by his mean boss Biff Tannen.  Marty's mother Lorraine is an overweight alcoholic, and his two older siblings are 20 something losers like their parents.In BTTF, through a series of strange events, Marty accidently travels back to 1955 and meets his own parents as----gasp---teenagers!!!  And while they may not have the technology, fashion and music that Marty has in 1985, they are teenagers just like him.  They are going through the same trials and tribulations of being a teen that Marty is in 1985.  And like typical teens, they think they are the coolest teens to ever exist on planet Earth.  At the end of the film, Marty says it's been ""educational"" and has been for the audience as well. By the way I'm not that ""old"" myself, I'm only 26, but I get sick of teenagers always acting like they are so different and cooler because of the superior technology they have grown up with.  But that's part of being a teen. I have to remind myself that back in the early and mid '90s we teenagers acted and complained about nearly all the same stupid stuff the teens today complain about.  I thought and acted exactly like they did until about 1995 or 1996.....something strange happened to me then, I entered my 20s and became an adult, and I had no more excuses to complain about being ""misunderstood"". :)",Back to the Future

446,cosmicfish14,The Future Is Now!!!,9,21 October 2015,"Back To The Future is one my favorite summer movies, it has everything a summer movie needs, comedy, suspense, a bit of action, and an eccentric old professor. And since today was the day that the future was predicted to be in (by the way I'm not reviewing Part 2, because I don't like it), I decided today would be the best day to review this movie.One aspect that I like about this movie is the contrast between the two different decades. For instance, when the movie begins we see the 80s where people wear strange looking clothes and Huey Lewis songs always play, then it cuts to the past with incredibly basic looking houses and cars and even the songs are different. That's kinda the reason I give this movie a pass with some of the cheesy 80s aspects, since it help differentiate the two different decades.Another thing I love about this movie is the way the story feels like it would be in a cheesy 50s or 60s comic, except it takes place in the 1980s. The tone of the film is almost always adventurous and fun, like what summer should be like: adventurous and fun.Also the movie has many iconic aspects, the Delorean, Doc Brown, the weird Rube Goldberg machine at the beginning and so many other little things.Anyways, Back To The Future is a movie I think everyone should see in their lifetime, not because it is emotionally powerful or philosophical, but because it a quintessential summer movie.Final Score: 9/10",Back to the Future
447,nirome,The perfect script,10,22 January 2019,"One of the many reasons why this is my favourite movie of all times is because it's got one of the best scripts ever written for a movie. Everything that it's set up at the very beginning, pays off later.
For a movie that had such a rocky start from the production point of view and whose very creators didn't have much faith in, it sure made box office waves all around the world and made it one of the most fondly remembered and classical movies of the 80s. It catapulted Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd to stardom and turned one of the biggest automobile failures of the 80s into an iconic vehicle.
Everything seemed to fall into place for this one. Not only the screenplay, but the acting, directing, production design, visual effects, editing and cinematography. It's an extremely tightly edited movie, not a moment wasted, it moves along like lightning, and after all this years, its 80s look hasn't aged it one bit. This is one of the most entertaining cinematographic experiences ever and if you still haven't seen it; What are you waiting for?. Let's go back in time!!""",Back to the Future
448,ericdabomb,Revolutionary movie,9,13 August 2000,"When this movie came out in 1985, it changed the world of film making forever. Zemeckis' well-crafted movie was a critical and box-office success and for good reason. I cannot even begin to describe the effect this movie had on myself and all of my friends. We literally watched it every single day during the course of a summer vacation and still could not get enough. So many elements of this movie are wonderful and should be used more in other films. The script is excellent and the direction is even better. The opening with the clocks was magnificent and Christopher Lloyd's acting was superb. The DeLorean time machine was a real gas and real horror show! Michael J. Fox really hit it big with this one and his character was one many people could relate to. Hill Valley was a great imaginary little town somewhere in California and Marty's girlfriend was pretty hot, too. It was hilarious when he gets hit by the car and is forced to stay in his mom's and grandparents house for the night. Much of the content in this movie was highly ironic and coincidental, but still managed to stay far away from becoming corny. I'm surprised it did not win as much awards as it did. Everything from Biff to George McFly was great and all the sets were awesome. The final scenes were pretty heart warming and the prom scenes were cool, too. I also enjoyed the scene where Biff crashes his car into the manure truck. Can we get any funnier? I own part 2 also, but have still not been able to get myself to purchase part 3. It is missing something that the first 2 had. I really loved part 2 because it was much darker than the first. The whole ""Hell Valley"" thing was pretty scary and also with the Libyan's in the first one. Wow! This movie is amazing. I can't get enough of it. It supplies everything a person needs for a night of watching movies with some friends. So like, anyone not like this movie? I cannot imagine a person rating this film any less than a 9. I saw the sets at Universal Studios a while back and that was a great experience that I will never, ever forget. I obviously recommend this movie to everyone who likes movies and I'm sure it will pass the test of time in every sense. I wonder what people in other countries think about this. Hopefully, everyone around he world enjoys it. Stars: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas something, Crispin Glover and other people. Rated PG-13 (I think) for some violence and adult content. I give it a 9.5/10 just because it got a little boring during some scenes.",Back to the Future

He is so funny and believable as Marty, a cool kid in a nerdy family, who works part-time for the local kooky scientist, Dr. Brown (played to the hilt by Christopher Lloyd--what a perfect choice for this role).  Dr. Brown accidentally sends Marty back to the 1950's where he runs into his parents and havoc ensues, because his presence prevents them from having their first meeting and threatens his very existence!  Crispin Glover was absolutely fantastic as the goofy father you wish you never had. (And Marty's reactions under his breath, ""my god, it's a wonder I was ever born""--equally hysterical.) I am unfamiliar with the actor who played Biff, the high school bully, but his echoing ""butthead"" throughout the movie had my entire family laughing.

You need to keep up with the plot and when things go awry, you can find yourself lost or just bored.Not so with BTTF. Even now, 26 years on, I was still sitting on the edge of my seat as Marty and the Doc attempted to get the lightning strike just right - and I KNOW that it all works out in the end.But that's the draw of this fantastic movie - it continues to thrill after 26 years!

452,Eightiesjunkie,"""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything.""",10,11 April 2014,"When you're reviewing a film that you love, it's hard sometimes to describe all the things that you love about it. Which is the greatest challenge I have in reviewing this. I'll try not to go into too much detail, but I will also try to go in as deep as possible as to why I love the film. When the film opens we're introduced to the Character of Marty McFly. He's a typical 80's teen, but also good natured at heart. Marty has dreams and aspirations of being a rock star, but is too unsure of himself to pursue them. He is best friends with the eccentric but lovable, Dr. Emmett Brown. We don't know how Marty and Doc became friends, but we can understand why they are. Doc is always guiding Marty to do what is right, and indirectly showing him to never give up. Their relationship in the film is one I really love, Because Doc is not just a mentor to Marty, he's also a somewhat surrogate parent. The plot is simply this: Doc calls Marty up, and asks him to come help him with his new invention: A Delorean time machine. Things go wrong, and Marty ends up sending himself back in time to 1955. Shortly afterward, Marty accidentally interferes with his parents meeting. So Marty must now try to repair the damage he caused, while Doc tries to find a way to send Marty back home. So, what do I love about the film? To begin with, everything! I love the film's concept: If I knew my parents in high school, would I be friends with them? When you're a kid, the only way to find out how your parents acted when they were your age was to ask a grandparent or relative, but think how different and exciting it would be to actually see it! I love the film's message: ""Never give up, and never stop trying."" I love the performances that all the actors give, and I love the re-creation of the '50's atmosphere. (I'm a big fan of '50's movies, music, and TV shows.) I just love the film all around. Would I recommend this to someone who hasn't seen it? YES, absolutely! Back to the future is one of those movies that you can watch multiple times, and with each time, it still holds as much magic as the first.",Back to the Future
453,cineasten89,A great movie... memorable.,10,25 May 2005,"I grew up loving this movie. I have surely been watching this movie some hundred times. The first time I was watching this movie was surely when I was about six years old. I knew Michael J. Fox - I just didn't know his name. I recognized him overall - in Spin City, The Frighteners etc. I had no good understanding of this movie when I was six years old, but hey, I was fascinated. Some five years later, I watched this again. With full understanding of this movie, I was not only fascinated - I completely loved it. Buying the DVD back in 2002, I watched this movie very regular in a period, pausing a while, trying to memorize everything. And it only raised my fascination and love for Back to the future.The plot? Marty McFly (J Fox) is an ordinary teenager in 1985 who usually meets his friend, the crazed doctor Brown (played by genial actor Christopher Lloyd), for some scientific researchs. But one night, he will find out what Dr Brown really is preparing - a time machine into a car. Surprised, but anyway fascinated, McFly loves the idea. But of an accident, McFly is going back to 30 years earlier his present date. And it is then he has to reunite his parents before everything goes weird - and if he doesn't replace everything as it was before, he risks to be unborn. Sounds crazy? Right. It does. But it is the point. Mixed with smart humor, well-done dialogs and fine ending, it is probably one of the best genre movies I've been watching. It's not only a science fiction movie. It is also a coming-of-age movie, mixed with action, comedy and drama. And all simply, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd, in particular his crazy Einstein-hair, make this movie great.

For good or bad, time puts things in their place. The current blockbuster happens to be an empty entertainment without much interest in delving into the issues that sometimes proposes. Back to the future is an example of this evolution to the current blockbuster. The themes of the film are developing roughly and put on the table interesting points but stays on the surface. The simplistic universe that proposes a priori annoying to take the movie as a serious thing but plays a lot in their favor to take it as a simple metacomedia of the time in retrospect.
BUT there are also good things, the script of the film is a masterpiece that nowadays is studied because it is so round. Its importance lies in giving coherence to science fiction that until then was left in second place.

Even though I liked Back to the Future more when I was a kid, I think it is an enjoyable flick for both adults and children. Certainly there were things that strained credibility; like the 30-something Lloyd looking 60 something, the people in the picture fading out of existence, and the lightning coming on the exact second of the minute change. But, this is a comedy, as well as a movie trying to deal with time travel, and I am able to put those petty complaints aside enough to realize how entertaining this film is.
I thought that Zemeckis and the actors did a very good job of blending comedy and action together in a smooth fashion. Fox's physical work was impressive to say the least, and I must have laughed at his athletic comedy 3 or 4 times. In short, this is an exciting, funny and memorable film for all ages.

458,jamesnicholls-58600,A film great for history enthusiasts and fit for the whole family,10,30 July 2020,"I've a history enthusiast so time travel films tend to be generally interesting for me and Back to the Future is arguably the best time travel movie of all time. The setting and years that the film took place I suppose could've been better, I think I would've preferred there to have been scenes involving 3 different years in this movie but just having 1955 and 1985 worked very well with the complex entertaining plot this film gives us. 1950's and 1980's USA are certainly not my favourite historical periods but they are both definitely interesting history periods so overall I really liked it and loved seeing the contrast and changes of the various buildings in Hill Valley in 1955 and 1985. It would've only made small difference in years in the film's time setting but I would've preferred Marty to have gone back to 1960 or the late 1950's instead of 1955 and had pretty much the same story with his parents except it would be 4 or 5 years later and that way they'd be more of a Rock n Roll, greaser and rocker culture in the past setting of this film, but that's just my personal preference.There were many emotional scenes in this movie, the film gives me some thought provoking scenes which makes me think deeply about my parents and love life, but for the most part in an emotionally positive enthusiastic way, especially as this film has a happy ending for the most part. There's so many emotional scenes in this film that it's too much to briefly mention all of them but most of them are emotional scenes involving a son and his parent or parents so if you have a particularly interesting relationship with your parents you'll probably find these scenes more interesting and emotional than most people, generally speaking.Off the top of my head, I can't think of any dull boring scenes this movie had, all the scenes are good and therefore the film is good from start to finish, the consistency of this film is brilliant. The film has a relatively slow start, but the slow start was necessary for character development to a certain extent. Some of the scenes at the start such as the first scene where Marty just walks around in Doc's home for a little while and the clocks start ringing and Marty's short journey from Doc's to his school are some examples of scenes that do make the beginning of this film relatively slow and relatively boring compared to the later parts of the film, but even those two scenes I mentioned were still definitely watchable and reasonably good in their own right.The plot of this film is flawless and epic. The chemistry between father and son, mother and son and friendships in this film will make you very entertained, if you're a history nerd like I am the looks of the various vehicles, as well as the old fashioned skateboards and diners from the 1950's will give you some joy. How this film has a young teenage boy pretty much healing himself and his parents whilst protecting his parents from a dangerous bully known as Biff Tannen 30 years into the past is in my opinion a very interesting complex plot full of emotion, facts and simple bliss.The character line up in this film is far from the best character line up in a movie, but most of the greatness this film has in my eyes comes from the film's plot, not the characters; the quality of the characters don't quite stack up compared to the quality of the film's plot. But the character line up in this film is still way above an average film, the only dull characters in this movie were the ones that didn't get a lot of screen time such as Marty's siblings and Jennifer, I felt Jennifer was a very under developed simplistic character for a character that's supposed to be the main character's girlfriend and she seemed to be a rather stereotypical boring unoriginal Hollywood Female character with no unique character traits of her own.The main characters though, Marty, Doc, Biff and Marty's parents were all above average characters, but they're all far from characters that are genuinely complex, well developed and sublimely unique. This film cleverly relies on the epic plot of the movie to make it so entertaining without having much in the way of great characters so really the characters never needed to all be great for this film to work as the turns the plot takes in this film makes much of the plot very relatable to the average person and therefore interesting and thought provoking.",Back to the Future

This film is without a doubt the best 'Back to the future' film ever made. What makes this film different from the other sequels is how it maintains its sense of fun and excitement all the way through the film. What I mean, is that although (Part 2 and 3) were good films, they didn't maintain its on-going thrill like the first film did. All three films had a sequence in which Martys mother/great-great grandmother had recovered Marty in either the McFly home, Baines home or at Biff Tannens home at the casino hotel until he woke up some hours later. In sequels 2 and 3 these films were good up until those scenes and then went completely down-hill after. In part 1, this film never went down-hill from beginning to end. The only aspect of this film that I didn't understand that I'm sure many viewers have noticed are the contradictions this film made (ie. Why George/Loraine McFly didn't remember Marty in 1985, from 30 years before - even though Doc Brown remembered him) which included even more contradictions in parts 2 and 3. Also the scene when the Doc was trying to send Marty back to 1985(via. The Clock tower) when the Doc was up the Clock Tower connecting cables, for that scene completely dragged-on. Other than this, this film was perfect in every way; The acting was good (especially by Biff Tannen/Thomas Wilson) it had an original storyline, perfect soundtrack, had great stuntwork and had a good dialogue.

467,Sneaky_Pete_XXVII,The first classy time travel film,10,15 May 2003,"Back to the future is probably the only time travel film that is interesting on a scientific angle, and fun on an adventurous level. The film (like most of the films that I like), has everything going for it. Cast, music, script, etc. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are perfect for the roles of Marty and Doc. I enjoy the fact that it explains the story in a way that for those of us who don't read up on time travel can understand.  Another thing that I liked about the film was that it took place in the 50's. If it had of been me writing it, I probably wouldn't of picked this era. But after seeing the film I probably would of reconsidered. I really don't like the 50's; but this film made me enjoy the story regardless, which is a powerful thing to do.   Back to the Future has everything for it, it attracts, and it flows with a positive plot and feeling. Making this film near the top of my choices of Sci-fi, and maybe perhaps over all genres.",Back to the Future

From the moment the clocks tick, to when the DeLorean shoots up into the sky, I'm trapped inside there. There are plenty of things that I enjoy about this film...  First of all, I want to mention something that most people take for granted. The Score. I love the music for this film. It REALLY suits it. Both with feeling and cinematically. I would really like to take my hat off for Alan Silvestri.  I also want to mention the camera work on this film. The camera work on this film is so awesome! In just about every scene I find the camera work is well done.  Another thing that I really enjoy in this film, is that it is one of the few movies where the movie is always flowing. No matter what is going on, it always seems that the film is always flowing well and with a large amount of interest. So I suppose that this flows much into story. At first glance, I don't quite understand why they chose them, but when the they justify the decision, it makes the film that much more interesting.  Overall...excellent!",Back to the Future
469,forecastmazy,WHY this is the GREATEST triology ever.,10,20 May 2003,"Okay so claiming something the greatest trilogy ever is a huge claim. I'll admit that, but I'd never have become a film student if it wasn't for Back To The Future....and that's right, not just Pt1, ALL THREE. Now let me explain....As a child Back To The Future held my attention like nothing else. Every second was like a magical moment. I remember very distinctly when I saw BTTF2 and BTTF3 in the movie theaters; they were two of my greatest childhood memories. I feel honored that I could even see such great movies in the theaters. Makes me feel bad about the kids who are gonna have memories of Jennifer Lopez movies...Marty Mcfly is a kid. He has a crappy family and doesn't know why. He doesn't have a car and doesn't know why. But he faces everyday troubles and hes really not that bad of a guy at the beginning of the movie. Despite his parents troubles Marty has grown up fine.Marty however has a friend who's strange but a genius named Doc who accidentally sends him back to 1955 where he sees his parents grow up? The small things that the parents do in the long run catch up to them. The small decisions in childhood affect their entire futures.As a kid, Marty grew up in the same time as myself and then travels to the two places you know you always wanted to go as a kid.... the mid 1950s, The Future and The Wild West. I mean I know I wanted to, that's why I played all three video games. Back To The Future has a nostalgic sense even if you weren't born in the 80s because it's done so well. The emotions are pretty much universal, especially for those who grow up in small towns/suburbia --- to see what your town was like in the future and the past....wouldn't that be amazing? ESPECIALLY amazing to see while you're growing up and still connected to the town (via school, etc...) Each movie in this trilogy has its own charm. It's hard to pick a favorite (but the first one IS really the best. I mean come on; you can't appreciate the changes in time if you don't see the first movie.)Now talking about this film on the level of a film student, this film is amazing. The motifs are done very well, The Mayor, The Clocktower, Doc's House, Marty's family growing and changing, The Cafe where Marty always goes to eat no matter what time it is. There's so many motifs that you only notice subconsciously unless your looking for them, but THEY are definitely there.Any lesser director would have just made up fancy looking things for the future. Made an old looking set for the past. BUT NO! This combination does it right. Returning the same place in different time, you ultimately see how time changes things and therefore you see the true cause and effect of life through time travel.The underlying concept of the movie - The small things change everything. Marty's scolds his mother for smoking and drinking so much as a teenager...and she doesn't grow up to be an ugly alcoholic. Marty makes his dad more confident...and he overcomes other challenges in life and isn't a greasy dork at 40. I mean it's a lot like the cause and effect idea that the TV show Quantum Leap uses (and LET ME TELL YOU that show does time travel sooooo right.)Anyone who says the sequels to Back To The Future sucked, or don't live up to the first one are just wrong. Their not looking and their judging it the wrong way. You can't watch Back To The Future with the judging eye filled with contempt the jaded pop culture of the now would give you. You must watch BTTF with the open eye of an awed film go-er. And then you will love the trilogy.This movie made Robert Zemeckis one of my personal heroes. Bob Gale as well. Bob Gale went on the write for Daredevil amongst a few other comics and is well respected in the comic world and you can clearly see why in this movie. IF YOU READ COMIC BOOKS you can see Zemeckis creates shots like in panels. Gale and Zemeckis seem to click in a unique and perfect way. There's not one thing you could change about this series. It's perfect the way it is. I'm just glad IMDB exists so I could express how much I love this series for how great of a movie is. The movie keeps your interest because the subject matter is great. The movie keeps long lasting appeal because it is well done and the motifs are great. IMDB only gives me 1,000 words to express how great this film is. And that's far too few.If you haven't seen these movies your already in the past.

473,vciccarello,Amazing Movie! *SO MANY SPOILERS*,10,30 March 2018,"This is my favorite movie of all time! It has a great plot, great comedy, and epic Sci_Fiction. 10/10  The movie starts off with Marty McFly going to Doc's house and eventually gets to school late with this girlfriend Jennifer Parker. Next, we met Mr.Strickland(The Principal) who gives both Marty and Jennifer a late pass and then insults Marty that he will never make it in the Music Tryouts(Marty doesn't make it though) . Marty then say ""Well the futue is gonna change"". What I mean is that Marty loves to play the guitair. After the tryouts, Jennifer and Marty start walking through Hill Valley and notice a 4x4 Toyota car that Marty dreams of getting. Then, Marty tells Jennifer about what he plans to do with that car when he gets it from his parents. Right when Marty and Jennifer about to kiss, a woman interupts them saying that Mayor is saying up money to replace a clock that was struck by lighting(you'll see how when Doc trys to get Marty back to 1985). When Jennifer's dad comes to pick her up, she writes her phone number on the piece of paper that the woman gave Marty and then kisses him. When Marty gets back home riding his skateboard, we met Marty's Father (George McFly) and Biff Tannen(George's bully and supervisor). They both met because a car crashed and George has to pay to fix the car. The car Marty wanted can't be bought now because of the crashed car. Next, we met the rest of the Family Lorraine McFly (Marty's mother), Dave McFly(Marty's brother) and Linda McFly(Marty's sister). At 12:28 am, Doc calls Marty to met him at Twin Pines Mall to show him something. That something was his Delorian that is now a Time-Machine. At around 1:30am a van with 2 men come up at the Mall and shoot Doc. Marty jumps into the Time-Machine and traveled to the year 1955. When Marty arrives to Hill Valley, he realises that he traveled to 1955 and decided to find Doc and ask him to help him get back to the year 1985. Before all this, Marty comes upon a Cafe that has a Phone and a phonebook. In the cafe, we met Marty's father at a younger age and Biff at a younger age also. We learn that George is a wimp and Biff is a bully with another bunch of dudes. When George leaves the Cafe, Marty follows him and then he spots George on a tree branch looking through binoculars at Lorraine(the young one. About George's age). George then falls from the tree.(This is how George and Lorraine got married in the first place) then Marty pushes George out of the way of a moving car and the the ca hits Marty. Marty is then taken into Lorraine's house and mets her and her family. Marty then leaves the house to go find Doc. After Marty finds Doc, Marty shows Doc the car that he invented. Suddently, Marty shows a picture of him and his siblings. One of their heads are missing, this means that they are getting erased from existance because the young Lorraine is in love with Marty instead of George. The next day, Marty introduces George to Lorraine and she ignores him. At lunch, Marty asks George why he doesn't want to ask Lorraine out. George says that she already wants to go out with someone like Biff. At night, Marty wakes up George with Van Halen music saying that he is Darth Vadar saying that if he doesn't ask Lorraine out to the dance, he will remove his brain cells. The next day, George mets Marty at the Cafe asking for help to ask Lorraine out because he doesn't know how to. Right when George asks out Lorraine, Biff and his crew comes up and demands for his money for entering the Cafe. Marty then trips Biff and then punches him and runs away. As Marty runs, he comes upon two kids riding some scooter thing. Marty breaks one of their scooter things and then rides it as a skateboard. As Biff and his crew try to ram Marty into a truck full of Cow Poop with his car, Marty climbs right over his car and lands back on his skateboard. Biff's car then crashes to the truck and next thing you know, they are covered in cow poop. Later, Marty stops over at Doc's house and they plan how to send Marty back in time. Lorraine then comes and asks Marty to the dance. Marty says yes. Later, Marty teaches George how to get Lorraine and take her to the dance. On the night of the dance, while Doc sets up everything to get Marty back to 1985, Marty drives Lorraine to the dance. Before the dance, Marty writes Doc a letter saying when he goes back in time, he gets shot. A few minutes after Marty parked, Biff and his friends lock Marty in a car truck for $300 damage to Biff's car after he crashed the car into the truck of Cow Poop while Lorraine was stuck with Biff in the car. At exactly 9:00 pm, George comes to the car and took Marty's advice to getting Lorraine and punched Biff in the face whice eventually knocked him out. After Marty gets freed from the car trunk by the band that played music for the dance, he saw that George and Lorraine were together. But Marty and his family were still getting erased from existance. At the dance, George kisses Lorraine and marty's existance wasn't in danger anymore and George was becoming ppular at school. After Marty's guitair solo of ""Johhny Be Good"" by Chuck Berry, Lorraine and George met Marty at the exit door and says that he must be going. Next, Marty mets Doc at the front of the clock tower and Doc gives Marty instructions of what he has to do to get back in time. Doc realizes that Marty gave him a letter about the future and tears it apart. As Doc tears apart the letter, a power line for their plan falls off the clock tower. Doc tell Marty to go towards the end of the stree and wait for the clock that he gave Marty to ring. After the clock rings, the Delorian somehow goes dead. Marty hits his head against the steering wheel and it turns back on. As Marty starts his long drive back to the clock tower, Doc accidently detaches another power line of their plan as he attaches the other part that fell first. Next, Doc swings on the power line and as soon as the ligntning struck, Marty came and Doc connected the power line and Marty has made it to 1985. After Marty gets back to 1985, the Delorian goes dead again and wouldn't turn on again. After the Delorian goes dead, the van with the 2 men are driving to the mall to shoot Doc. Marty starts to run to the mall to keep Doc from getting killed. We see Doc get shot again and ther old Marty travel to 1955. After the van crashes into a mini building, Marty checks on Doc. Doc is alive because he was wearing a bullet-proof vest. Marty asks Doc how he knew he was gonna get shot and he shows Marty the torn up letter he gave him. Doc drives Marty back home and says that he going into the future 30 years. The next morning, we met Marty's family and Biff, and they all look different! Biff doesn't mess with George anymore and Dave wears a suit to the office now. Marty's mother said that he got the car he wanted. After Marty sees his car, Jennifer shows up and asks him ""How about a ride mister?"". After they were about to kiss again, Doc comes back to 1985 and tells Marty that something has got to be done about his kids. Marty tells Doc that he doesn't have enough road to get up to 88mph. Then, Doc says, ""Where we're goin' we don't need roads"". The car starts to fly in the air and flys into the screen. The end!Oh boy! This took me a very long time to type, but it's worth hearing about the movie again! 10/10",Back to the Future
474,Crystal_Hansen,Another great performance by Christopher Lloyd,7,31 January 2019,"I know I've seen this movie before but I couldn't remember when or what happened. I kept getting it confused with Flight of the Navigator, a very similar movie in which a 12 year old boy disappears for eight years and suddenly comes back having not aged at all. Set in very similar time periods, it was easy to get them confused. Both are about time travel. One goes to the past and almost messes up history. One goes to the future after being gone for an extended period of time. Neither character look like they've aged. Marty is only in the past for a week, so you can't really age that much anyway.
When Marty McFly travels back in time to 1955 and spends that week with inventor Dr Emmett Brown who he knew in 1985. When Marty saves his father's life and gets hit by his grandfather's car, he has to figure out a way to get his parents together so that he'll still exist in the future. His father, once a poor businessman who gets bullied by his boss, becomes a wealthy author whose childhood bully becomes an employee and has to wax his cars.
After reading some of the Goofs on this site, I learned that there were quite a few historical errors, mostly relating to when a particular thing was first introduced to society. Silly things like a Pepsi thermometer in the soda shop that wasn't introduced to society until a couple years later. Or the type on a poster that wasn't around that year. Or the vibrato thing on Marty's guitar when he's playing at the dance. I've seen Flight of the Navigator a movie that takes place in 1986, a little more than a year after this movie.
Christopher Lloyd as an actor is awesome. He's played many roles in many different movies and TV shows. He voices the Hacker in the children's series Cyberchase. He's the criminal guy in Dennis the Menace. He plays as Doctor Emmett Brown in all the Back to the Future movies. He's the professor in the second season of the BYUtv series Granite Flats. He voices Rasputin in Disney's version of Anastasia. Those are just the movies and tv shows I can think of off the top of my head. How many movies has this guy played in? He plays all of his roles beautifully and I would definitely watch other movies that he's in. He's a great actor. He seems to get a lot of roles for villains and crazy old people, but he plays them well.",Back to the Future

I remember seeing it for the very first time over seven years ago and I couldn't care less about it, but when I saw it again last month, I've been watching it regularly around twice a week!!BTTF is a fast-paced laugh-fest, unlike the many comedies out there, and it is a MUST MUST MUST-SEE! Fox is great and I doubt if the movie would have been even half as enjoyable if Eric Stoltz (who was replaced by Fox) played Marty McFly! Lloyd is absolutely amazing as the hyperactive Doc Brown, but the show stealer is Crispin Glover as the wimp father of Fox's McFly! His George McFly (from 1955) has just gotta be seen! Biff Tannen is played PERFECTLY by Thomas F. Wilson, and last but not the least, Marty's mom is just pure and simple WONDERFUL! Lea Thompson did an excellent job as both the Lorraines!

477,graham_525,a serious plot hole,9,18 August 2006,"I do really like this film and it is from an era when I was a teenager. It definitely captures the mood of the eighties and also the nostalgia for the fifties which was prevalent in the seventies and eighties. I'm not really one for picking holes in movies as the whole point of going to the cinema is that you are entering a fantasy realm. However when watching BTTF recently I noticed a serious plot hole. There has to be a suspension of logic when time travel is involved but usually time travel films make their own internal cock eyed sense if you accept that time travel is possible. In BTTF though there is a lack of internal consistency which I will explain. When Marty travels back in time he alters history and returns to his own time to discover things have changed. This means though that there are in effect two Marty's. The one who we follow through out the film and the one who grew up in the history in which his father punched biff and lives a much better life. When Marty returns at the end he see's ""himself"", a different Marty, being chased by the terrorists and going back in time. The problem is, what happens to this Marty? Where does he go? The Marty at the end is the same one who grew up in the original history where his Father was run over by the car. If the second Marty went back to 1955 he would find the other Marty there with him. Also when the musician calls Chuck Berry to let him hear Marty playing Chuck Berry on the guitar we are supposed to accept that this is a case of effect before cause. But even in this context it doesn't make sense because Marty grew up in a different history in which Chuck Berry hadn't heard him play guitar and so wouldn't have developed that sound. Anyway, it's a fantastic film despite this or perhaps even because of this crazy paradoxical plot.",Back to the Future

479,Brad2002,One of the best (includes spoilers!),10,14 February 2004,"This is one of those movies that shouldn't get a high rating, but is one of my favorites anyway. Generally, highly popular, sci-fi/adventure, movies are not thought of as great, but this is definitely an exception. Why is that? It's the script, IMO. I have yet to see such a brilliant and clever script since. Examples are: Marty's mom berating the behavior she herself was guilty of as a teenager; Marty creating a makeshift skateboard, which he is shown to be very adept at riding in the present, out of an old time scooter in 1955; George Mcfly punching out Biff turns George into a confident, successful writer and Biff into a stumbling oaf; and, of course, Marty inventing rock n roll. Every story writer/screenwriter should really study this script to see how the great ones are constructed.    Another reason this movie is so good is that the casting is as good as it can be. I really can't imagine any other actors in those roles.    Beyond that, the movie is just so much fun to watch - it's one of those movies I've seen a hundred times and still watch if it comes on TV.",Back to the Future

The cast and their chemistry on screen are unforgettable: Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is an energetic teenager with a passion for music and someone who does not want you to call ""chicken"".Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown is a scientist who wants to invent something unique that works and to change the world. With his new invention of time travel that he made out of a DeLorean. Christopher Lloyd's performance was not nominated for an Oscar because his performance was the most fascinating part of the movie and one of the most interesting performances in a movie that I've seen in a long while. More praise goes to Chrispin Glover's performance as George McFly. He was my favourite part of the movie, especially the two scenes where he tries to woo Lorraine Baines and says ""I'm your density"" one of my favourite movie quotes. The moment in the film (SPOILERS just in case you haven't seen it yet) where he stands up to Biff surprised me and showed me that he could stand up for himself and the woman he loves. Lea Thompson was fantastic as well as Lorraine Baines.Back to the Future was something that surprised me because I never knew now how much I would love it.

482,mvpdom,The best time travel movie ever!!!!,10,2 June 2020,"This was one of my favorite movies from the time I was little. Even though my parents rarely let me watch it because ""it had to much cussing"". But I still loved it. Greatest time travel movie ever. (Even if the time travel makes no sense)
What is about this movie that makes it superior to almost ever other movie I have ever watched.
The defining feature of this movie is the humor and it is really quotable. ""I'm Darth Vader from the planet Volcon"" ""You're my density"" "" So you're tellin' me that you built a time machine, out of a dalorine"" ""Hello its your cousin Marvin, Marvin Berry. You know that new sound you've been looking for, well listen to this.
It is without a doubt the best movie about a kid going back in time for his mom to have the hots for him. ""So you're tellin' that my mom has the hots for me, whoa this is heavy"".
You could nit pick this movie all day. Yes! it is a plot convenience that all the these important events happen within a week together in 1955. Though it makes perfect sense that they were all brought up in the future. Why does Marty slowly disappear instead of instantly. Though these are both worthy sacrifices for the story.
This movie is so funny and I could go through the whole movie and pick out something every 10 seconds. Though to be a highly regarded classic there needs to be more than just humor. Marty is an average kid living in 1985 with the exception that he hangs around with a crazy scientist. Marty has a girlfriend and seems to be annoyed by the faults of his family, rightfully. Trough out his journey into the past he holds in his mind that Doc has been shot dead when he leaves. He tries to tell him the whole movie about the future, but he does not want to hear. But Doc thought ""What the hell"" . (Which the motivation does not make a whole lot of sense, though he did have 30 years.) Though it is rewarding and heart warming when you see Doc listen and stay alive.
Doc is mostly funny, but also misunderstood for because he is actually a genius, he made a time machine. ""Great Scott!"" ""1.21 gigawatts"" ""The fulx copasitor this is what makes time travel possible""
The mom is funny, just by the fact she is into her son, but in the end she realizes it. ""When I kiss you it feels like I'm kissing my brother."" ""I have never seen anyone wear purple underwear before.""
The best character with the most growth is George McFly. He never stands up to anyone, but Marty is successful in getting him to stand up against Biff (Even better than the original plan). ""Hey you get your dam hands off of her"". The music and the score is great. And even better his guitar performance at the end.
Biff is terrible and the worst and that is what is great about him, when Marty stand up to him you love it, when manure is dumped on him you love it, and best of all is when George punches him.
The movie is not really about character growth, except for George and for Marty it was just ""Educational"". The movie is really held together by the race against time to send Marty back to the future, and of course every thing goes wrong until it doesn't. It is thrilling and rewarding as the movie drags you along as the music invokes one of the strongest senses of nostalgia.
This movie is superior to both the sequels, even though they are just as much apart of one of the greatest trilogies ever. This movie is timeless and always delightful. It is in my top 10 favorite movies. 10/10.

483,kennarb-23010,Back to the future,5,30 January 2019,My favorite scene of the movie was when he came back to the future and his dad had a new car and was making his bully wax it. One personal experience to this movie is sometimes I talk such long naps that I end up feeling like I slept through a couple of years. The filmmaker is telling you that you should be glad you didn't go to school with your parents. They are also telling you that when your mom is hitting on you things can get a little weird. I knew in this part if history that women wore dresses. I also new they didn't have super nice cars. Something that is similar to this time in history is that people are still super clingy in relationships. I have not seen movies by this director. I think this was a good movie. I wouldn't mind seeing other movies by these people. I think the actors did a really good job. I liked the camera angles they were different from what you normally see. I don't think this is a movie I would watch outside of school. If I were to recommend this movie to someone it would be to my parents.,Back to the Future

I have watched this film over and over again and it never failed to impress me with it's charms. It started a trilogy that became one of the best loved and most succesful series' of all time. I really love this movie.Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is a typical teenager living in 1985 California. But he has got a couple of problems. He has a great band, but nobody gives him a chance. His parents are losers and his dad gets pushed around by hig-school bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who is now his boss. Marty has ambition, but he doesn't want to turn out like his parents. But one night, he agrees to meet his friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in a mall parking lot at 2 am. What could be so important? Well, Doc has just invented a time machine! But they are attacked by terrorists that have been ripped off by Doc and Marty inavertenly travels 30 years back in time! Now, in 1955, he meets his parents and disaster strikes! Marty's mom is in love with him and his dad is still a loser. With the help of the Doc from 1955, he must repair the time machine, get his parents to fall in love, and get back to the future, or he's history!This movie sparkles with charm from the performances of all the cast. Micheal J. Fox is absolutley perfect as Marty and Christopher Lloyd displays amazing comedic talent in his role and it amazes me how criminally unappreciated he is. I also have to mention that Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Wilson are terrific.Back to the Future is very, very funny. It has lots of in-jokes to other movies and Fox and Lloyd are given some great dialogue by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, who wrote the script. I am astonished how much a laugh every time I see this movie, even for the ump-teenth time. With credit to the visual effects and a great score, I think everyone will find Back to the Future a pinnacle in the careers of Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg and love it for the unmistakeable movie magic that it holds. I know I do.",Back to the Future
485,wezzel,heavy,10,19 August 2001,"The BTTF-films may very well be the best movie trilogy ever, they sure are a lot more entertaining then the Godfather-filmsFirst of all, the trilogy is a unique storytelling experiment, the 3 films make one big story, one can't be seen without the other ones. Everything about these films is great. The score by Alan Silvestri can compete with the best work of John Williams.  The special effects are (though a little bit dated) efficient and functional.  Lloyd and Fox are playing the parts of their lives, and they're doing a hell of a job! Robert Zemeckis, one of the most underrated directors of our time, keeps the pacing tight and the storyline even tighter.  Who cares if there are some plotholes, this is a sci-fi comedy people!This really is a lot more then just another story for boys, everything fits together so perfectly.  I must have seen the films a dozen of times and I still discover new things! If you haven't seen them yet, leave whatever you're doing and buy/rent them (make sure you watch then in the right order, I saw part II before I saw part I: it didn't made much sense)Just wish I could go to the future and buy those DVD's (how much longer Universal???)",Back to the Future
486,ryansassy1,The movie that made time travel cool.,9,21 October 2012,"Recipe for fun: take one teenaged boy from 1985, a ""mad"" scientist who's obsessed with finally getting his 30-year experiment to work, and a very special Delorean--mix in some family troubles and a complicated love triangle; cut in some quotable dialog; heat it up with plenty of action; remove from the '80s and let cool in the '50s; and top it all with Huey Lewis and the News.There may be one or two people left on the planet who don't know the plot to Back to the Future. Okay: Young Marty is accidentally sent back in Doc Brown's Delorean from 1985 to 1955 and has to contact eccentric Doc's 30-years-younger version to help him get back to the future. (See what I did there? Clever, right?) Marty's biggest challenge is to not change anything in his past that could adversely affect the future -- say, preventing his mom and dad from falling in love, which would jeopardize his very existence. OOops! That's already messed up, so now he must correct the mishap or he'll disappear before he can get back to 1985.Every element of Back to the Future works to create the coolest comedy of its decade. The comic situations that result from Marty trying to play matchmaker to his own parents are very well-played. Of course the best fun comes in when we get to experience (and in some cases, re-experience) the '50s from an '80s perspective. All these good times are helped along by having the easily likable Michael J Fox in the lead and the incomparable Christopher Lloyd as the hyperactive Doc -- a role he was born to play. Unflagging, quotable dialog powers the plot wonderfully.Back to the Future is the kind of movie that can appeal to anybody from ages 10 to 100. When I saw this in the theater in '85 it was an instant hit across all cliques from the nerds to the jocks -- my generation's primer on time travel movies. I remember laughing right along with my mom and my little sisters. Not that many films manage to pull off that kind of magic, then or now.",Back to the Future

High school teenager Marty McFly is sent back to 1955 through a DeLorean time machine invented by his friend, nutty scientist Doc Emmett Brown. Once there, he inadvertently changes the course of time. He must now do everything he can in order to bring his parents back together or he and his siblings will be erased from existence. He must also fight off school bully Biff Tannen and ultimately get back to the future. Director and co-writer Robert Zemeckis gives us pure solid entertainment with excellent pacing, likable characters, and a cleverly-written screenplay. The special effects are also exceptional. Twenty years later, they still look fresh and new. Zemeckis also succeeds in bringing to life an idealized and nostalgic 1950's look. Furthermore, the movie is filled with great performances. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are superb and have great chemistry together. Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, and Thomas F. Wilson are also splendid in their underrated performances. Alan Silvetri's musical score and a couple of songs from Huey Lewis and the News are also enjoyable and serve their purpose to heighten the excitement. This is such a great movie for people of all ages. It personally holds a special place in my heart because of the fond memories it brings.

This movie made me first fall in love with 80's films and made me the person that I am TODAY! I loved George McFly because I was a nerdy alienated adolescent myself. I also remember I got a little aroused when Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) was about to make out with Micheal J. Fox, who was suppose to be her son. I found that part a little messed up, but also arousing. Although Biff was a complete jerk towards George McFly and acted like a creep to Lea Thompson's character. I found the part amazing and scary when George McFly had the balls to fight off Biff from him almost raping Lea Thompson. I was scared on how George McFly (Crispin Glover) was trembling, and was about to make a fists, and had a horrified look on his face.

494,Science_Fantasy_Guy,"Timelessly hilarious, charming and adrenaline-pumping: a blockbuster for the ages.",10,21 April 2009,"As you probably could've guessed from my username, Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future is one of those very special and rare movies that I would defend vehemently. One of the most inventive, adrenaline-pumping, amusing and eye-popping movies of all time, and one that's completely devoid of pretension, pomposity and self-consciousness, Back to the Future is a film that never fails to leave me feeling like I'm on Cloud Nine. Here's why.The year is 1985. Rebellious Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, a last-minute replacement for Eric Stoltz, who failed to exude the laidback charm Zemeckis wanted the character to have) lives in the quaint (and fictional) Californian town of Hill Valley, where he has a beautiful and supportive girlfriend named Jennifer (played by Claudia Wells). Marty despairs of his alcoholic mother Lorraine and pushover father George (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) and thus spends most of his time hanging out with Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), a goofball scientist who, as it turns out, has just invented a DeLorean time machine (the time machine originally was intended to be a refrigerator, but Zemeckis changed it to a car because he worried that after seeing Marty walk through a refrigerator kids would follow suit). During a test run, however, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955. Now, whilst trying to get back to the future, he encounters run-ins with his father's lifelong bully Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and must somehow make sure his parents-to-be meet and fall in love – which is not as easy it sounds when Lorraine falls head over heels in love with him.There is no department that makes a false move on this film. Firstly, the cast dynamic is flawless: Fox's Everyman affability has never been put to better use, Lloyd enjoys what is unquestionably the defining role of his career as the nutty scientist, Thompson and Glover revel in playing Marty's parents as teenagers and adults in middle-age, and Wilson brings menace and later even a little accurate lowliness to his role as the pathetic bully who finally gets his comeuppance. Technically, Back to the Future has aged like wine as well: the art direction is effective in its subtlety and accuracy to '50s culture, the editing is swift, but not to an extent that you can't make out everything that's happening on-screen, and although there aren't as many of them as you'd think given the type of film this is, the special effects are still superb by today's standards. Alan Silvestri's jazzy, electronic score is yet another element that raises the excitement enormously.But at the end of the day, this really is Bob Zemeckis' show. Firstly he and Bob Gale co-wrote an ingenious screenplay so bursting with invention and peppered with sparkling humour (see the 1955 dinner scene, most notably) and heart that the years have done nothing to lessen the sense of wonder it brings. Secondly, his direction of Back to the Future is perfectly executed, especially for a blockbuster (and even I must admit to having a love/hate relationship with blockbusters sometimes): Zemeckis' directorial effort here is energetic, slick, cunning and fast-paced in the action scenes and cleverly subtle in the slower moments, his passion for the story apparent in every frame. Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich, leave the blockbusters to the true masters and stop embarrassing yourselves.Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, one of the highest-grossing films of the '80s and a film that continues to have a huge impact on popular culture and film-making to this day, is a spectacular blockbuster that flawlessly combines dazzling and incredibly exciting action sequences with a sweet thematic centre that never ventures into cheesy territory, all the while being laced with wickedly funny humour. It's a film that, like very few of its contemporaries, has managed to avoid developing a negative reputation due to its large-scale success and continues to enchant new legions of young movie fans as well as remaining an all-time favourite of many older movie fans, and it will continue to do that for many years to come.",Back to the Future

The plot of the movie shows a young Micheal j fox travel back in time and a lot of things go wrong and he has to fix them or else the future will be messed up. This part of history 1985 is very interesting to me it seems like it was really fun to be a teen or kid. Everything was so simple and it made sense. When they travels to th 1950 world the movie did a good job depicting that year and made it seem like that was the year the movie was actually made. I have seen the whole trilogy and i am glad I have because it is a very fun watch. I really like the scene where George Mcfly punches biff and saves the day and gets the girl who he deserves. One thing I didnt like but also like at the same time were the cheesy edits and special effects its kind of funny to see when we look at todays technology. I would deferentially recommend this movie to anybody looking for a good time.,Back to the Future
496,Low Man,A dissenting voice,1,28 July 2004,"OK...it looks like I'm the only person in civilization that hates this movie. I was at a friend's house, and it was rented for part of the evening's entertainment. I saw it way back in 1985 when it came out, and I did not then have any particularly hostile feelings toward it, but after seeing it again recently and looking through the comments on IMDb, I must conclude that it is the most overrated film ever made.A quick browse through the comments yields such superlatives as, ""Fantastically scripted sci-fi comedy!!"", ""The perfect movie package"", ""One of the most original idea ever to put on film""(sic), and ""One of the best movies ever made in the history of film making."" Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, I guess.Plot-wise, this movie is as sit-com formulaic as they come. I can see how the pitch went to get this film made. ""We'll make an episode of Three's Company meets Happy Days with some time travel in it!"" I must also point out that this film is not science fiction. It is fantasy.Maybe this is my own personal problem, but science fiction should make some attempt at plausibility. This movie relies on a device called the 'flux capacitor' that requires gigawatt's of power and a DeLorean moving at 88 miles an hour to function, although why this is the case and what the device does is never even vaguely delineated. The film would have been just as plausible if it involved a wizard that zapped people back in time with a medieval talisman and an incantation that required precise rhythm and pronunciation. It might even have been more plausible that way.I suppose it's the 'science fiction' of it that really honks me off. It seems that so many people regard this film as good sf, and it is not. If you want a good example of sf, look at Terry Gilliam's Brazil. Many people find that film confusing and impenetrable, but good sf usually takes some work to appreciate because it deals with concepts that most people haven't thought about. This film just takes a formulaic stroll through a combination of well-worn clichés to be found all over situation comedies and time travel stories. Come to think of it, Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys deals with the time travel concept far better than this film does.OK, this isn't to say the film has no redeeming qualities. It does have some amusing moments. As a sit-com, it's OK. For comedy in science fiction, though, the Fox network show Futurama is vastly better.",Back to the Future

On the contrary, in reality it would make him even more unpopular, and Biff would get his gang onto him.3) At the end of the film, when Marty has changed his family's futures, the film portrayed materialism as a form of success, hence the luxury cars; ""Here are your keys Marty!"" Back in the day here in Europe, film critics resented this portrayal of materialism representing happiness (even if the US critics thought nothing of it !)There it is; nostalgic but stupid !

I wish I could get my hands on Doc's time machine so I could go back in time to fix the mistakes I made in my life... who doesn't!?! Cherish these movies and show them to your kids and grandkids... they will love them so much you can count on them sharing the adventure of Marty Mcfly and Doc well into their FUTURE!",Back to the Future

Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.",Back to the Future

523,mohammedalawami-10948,The perfect movie does not exis....,10,4 February 2021,"Everyone has already talked about how amazing and fun this movie is and I'm going to join in. I went in this movie with very high expectations with everyone saying how amazing it was and somehow this movie exceeded my expectations. This movie is just perfect!Michael J Fox and all the other actors are incredible in this movie. Fox has such a natural dynamic with Christopher Lloyd. Their friendship seems too real at times. Lea Thompson really delivers this performance of a thirsty teenage girl, Thimas Wilson perfectly sells this hateful bully so it was so satisfying seeing Bill taken down but Cristin Glover sells the film and his performance is a huge reason into why George has an amazing character arc.And now let's talk about the script because this movie truly has one of the best and most exciting scripts and stories. Everything is set up so perfectly in the beginning with the character's backgrounds, personalities as well as the locations and important informatiom all being established so well for the 1955 section. Not a single scene is wasted. Every scene plays a role in the overall story and everything is linked together and this plot of Marty trying to get his 1955 version mom and dad to fall in love is a perfect concept given everything set up leading to a very exciting climax and a great character journey for George McFly.Speaking of the climax, it's probably the best part of the movie. Mainly because the movie does a great job by increasing tensions and leaving you wondering if Marty will even return back to 1985. I mean, the plan should have been a breeze but so many things went wrong and you're alwaus glued to the screen as you aren't sure what's going to happen and this leads to an emotionally satisfying climax where George and Lorainne finally kiss and that 80s music makes it 10 times better and a heart-racing climax where it seems as though Doc will fail to bring Marty to 1985 but he does and the ending is perfect, seeing Marty's family all so happy.This film is just so awesome and gets better everyime I rewatch it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop what you're doing immediately, turn on Netflix and watch the movie. You'll not be disappointed. A must-see for everyone!",Back to the Future

That is until his eccentric, scientist friend Doc Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) builds a time machine and sends him back to 1955. From there the movie really accelerates into exhilarating fun that get more complicated as it goes on but will keep you entertained until the very end.Pretty much everything about 'Back to the Future' works from the interesting characters, to the clever humour, to the magical experience of going back in time.

537,cryofry,BTTF is excellent entertainment,10,20 March 2008,"BTTF is a magical film that can be watched again and again and never tires. I first saw it when I was about 10 years old and it became an instant personal favourite, somewhat due to the fact that the ""future"" coincided with my own year of birth.Conceived by the highly talented duo of Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis (the two Bob's), it tells the story of a 1980s teenager who is accidentally transported back in time to the 1950s in a plutonium-powered DeLorean created by an oddball scientist. His brief trip back in time turns into a nightmare after he inadvertently prevents his parents from meeting and subsequently jeopardises his own existence. Working with the 1950s counterpart of the scientist who created the time-machine, he must find a way to make his parents fall in love and get back to the future.On the surface, the story seems rather simple and straightforward, but if you look deeper, you will find that this film has many complex layers, which make it an utterly brilliant piece of work.It is also full of coincidences. For instance, our time-travelling hero, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travels from 1985 to 1955, with the latter been exactly 30 years in the past. There are countless other coincidences that are scattered throughout the film, many of which can be picked up after repeat viewings.

This specific trilogy is proof that most sequels are always worse than the original (although the sequels of it are quite enjoyable but perform far from the ""classic status"" of the original).Its a classic and probably the best movie of the 80s. It is very enjoyable and engaging because you get drawn to it as you (in later viewings) try to find the small hidden changes that come by alternating the time-line.The cast is also brilliant - it was like they were born for these roles: Christopher Lloyd is the perfect mad scientist, Michael J.Fox is very believable playing a teen (although in his twenties) and Lea Thompson is great (and obviously very talented) playing the different Lorraines in different time zones.

What would you think of them? Would you hang out with them? What if the parent of the opposite sex developed a crush on you? This is the inspired premise behind a movie that will live on forever in my heart, the best film I have ever seen out of thousands of films. Back to the Future received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Screenplay and numerous technical awards. It was the biggest box office hit of 1985. None of that explains what makes the film so perfect. What makes it perfect is the way it hooks you with it's premise and then carries it out in a manner that will entertain and enlighten you. It's a film that expertly blends so many genres. It's a comedy, a drama, a rip roaring thrill ride, sci fi action adventure, and love story. No movie I've seen pulls off all these genres at the same time. The movie transports you back in time and teaches us how our lives are connected and the significance of your family roots. If you're an adult, you marvel at the recreation of the 50s and the knowing jokes, such as the disbelief of realizing that the actor Ronald Reagan was going to become president. As a child, you realize that yes, your parents were young once and they were even like you in many ways. These are just some of the issues the film deals with. You care about the characters and live through their strengths and flaws. It's hard to imagine anyone other than Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly but as fate would have it, he was the replacement for Eric Stoltz (a terrific actor who apparently was considered too intense for the role.)  This bold decision by the producers to scrap several weeks of filming and replace the lead actor was a risk that paid off beyond their wildest dreams. Fox dissolves into the role so easily that his acting talent sometimes gets overlooked because he makes it look so effortless. As for Christopher Lloyd, no need to replace him. This is the role he will always be remembered for. Who else could handle the rapid fire delivery and sheer energy that his Doc Brown called for? He has a lot of the best lines. Hats off to Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, who each endured makeup allowing them to play 17 and 47. Their joy in playing these characters comes through. All the roles down to the smallest were wonderfully cast. The marvelous sets, costumes, editing, music, sound effects, etc. And of course, hats off to Director Robert Zemeckis, who went on to make Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump. This remains his masterpiece. He also did both of the good but inferior sequels. This is the movie to put into the time capsule (Delorean). Can't wait for the re-release.",Back to the Future
545,homie_g,A well though-out film in which a strong foundation is set the great sequels.,9,18 October 2001,"This film is an impressive creation of the incredible adventure of time travel.  Many aspects of this film make it work, especially the talents of the great director Robert Zemekis.  It is a movie where the new kid on the block of the 80's truly shines with great acting.  The other main actors of this movie, eg the Doc, Biff, George, Lorraine were an excellent cast selection.The musical score for this film by John Williams is as usual, a fantastically composed piece of musical art that fits perfectly in to Back to The Future.  The film was excellently edited, contained phenomenal special effects and many great moments.  In my opinion a movies main job is to create special moments, and this one had no shortage.Other aspects of this film made this a success, ie the lighting, set, acting, props(which includes the DeLorean), the several motifs that run through the movie about 'time'(music, clocks, being late for something etc) and many more.  The camaraderie between Marty and the Doc in 1985 and 1955 is beautifully contrasted in that they make solid friendships in both time frames.The audience can tell this movie isn't meant to be a totally series film and that it is also a comedy aswell as science fiction.  The deliberate over-acting sometimes visible, ie when the Doc says, ""..Next Saturday night were sending you back to the future!,"" and points straight to the camera shows this, and is appropriate in this comedy.  Also when George says, '..And not you or anyone on this planet is going to make me change my mind..""  This in addition to the comedy tells the audience that the film she be taken as a light hearted sci-fi comedy.Robert Zemekis has shown in this film that he is indeed a prolific director.

And the writers knew that, so they put in some dillemmas and suspenseful moments which rids the movie from any dull moments and keeps the audience's attention throughout.The two central roles of Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown played by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd respectively are so good! Memorable in every way even if their characterizations sound generic at first, they just play them out so well you can't dislike them.

Its first Sci Fi/Family/ then Comedy/Action/. It has everything.The story is a gem. Marty (Michael J Fox) is stuck in the year 1955 after escaping from a group of terrorists who were out for revenge after their plutonium had been stolen by Doctor Emmett Brown for his new invention, a time machine. Marty in 1955, is without plutonium and has to figure out how to get back. Fortunately for him, he ""knows"" his history and devises a plan with the doc from 1955 to get back to 1985. Oh, did i mention his parents. That is another story in itself.It doesn't get anymore original than that. The writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale did an incredible job.

551,tristandetwiler,We're sending you Back to the Future! This is my second favorite film of all time.,10,21 December 2013,"Plot:Where the film shines. The opening scene is presented perfectly. It sets up flawlessly the central theme of time and space. There's even a small bit of foreshadowing with the image of a man hanging onto one of the clocks. A person hanging onto time, as most people describe it. The hint of the stolen plutonium is nicely presented with News Reel and then the reveal of the actual crate under the bed. It's great story-telling that doesn't use any dialogue, and there's a lot of it in this movie. There are SO many minor details that make perfect sense in the context of the story. Mart Mcfly, played by Michael J. Fox, goes back in time to the year 1955. He lands in a farmland that was owned by the man ""Peabody"". It was all replaced by the year 1985 and turned into the ""Twin Pines Mall"". Of course, Marty goes back to the past and knocks down one of the two Pine Tress Peabody had set up. Marty goes back to the present by the end of the film, and the mall's sign now says ""Lone Pine Mall"". None of this is explored through dialogue, but just through actions. It all makes sense. There's lots of people I know that never knew some of the information that Robert Zemeckis cleverly implements into this picture. The License plate on the back of the Delorean Time Machine reads ""OUTATIME"". Clever, right?Characters:""I can't believe you would loan me a car, without telling me it had a blindspot, OK? I coulda' been killed! I also want to know about this! I spilled beer all over my shirt, who's gonna' pay for my cleaning bill?"" This is main villain's first scene. The character is named Biff Tannen, played by Thomas Wilson, and it's possibly the best introduction to any character in any movie. Biff is talking to Marty's father, George Mcfly, about his car that Biff accidentally totaled. It's not spoon-feeding the audience that Biff is a villain, but just from what he says delivers the same message. It's so clever, that words can hardly describe it. Speaking of George Mcfly, whose played by Crispin Glover, his character is portrayed brilliantly. Crispin's charismatic enigma truly shows how much of a genius he is. I can't even imagine any other person who could take Crispin's place. The worried and timid attitude that the character has is shown powerfully from Crispin through frail and prissy acting. The best line in the whole film is from George Mcfly when he's acting up the nerve to talk to Lorraine. In the diner and walks to the counter, ""Give me a milk. Chocolate."" Grabs the sliding glass, drinks it, then slams it down. You just have to see it for yourself.Visuals:The composite shots are so obvious, but that's what characterizes 80's action and science fiction films. It works great! I'd rather have these effects over CGI just because they're natural visual effects. The added flames and sparks added to the DMC Delorean when it's time traveling has become a staple of pop culture. It's just a shame that the set the final scene was filmed on accidentally burned down years later... TWICE.Enjoyment:I could pop this in any moment of any hour of any day, and it would not lose a single ounce of its charm. It's truly a masterpiece; one of the best movies ever made. The dialogue and conversations alone make it worth it.Rewatchability:Let me tell you, it was a real treat getting to see this movie on the big screen TWICE. Once for the AMC Exclusive Release and the Cinemark Re-Release. If you haven't seen this film, then get your head checked. This movie is one of the best films ever created.

552,buddyboy28,Nearly 30 years on and it's still a terrific movie.,10,7 July 2014,"Michael J.Fox is perfectly cast as Marty Mcfly, a teenager who's family is dysfunctional to say the least. His mother Lorraine (Lea Thonpson) is an heavy drinker and his father George (Crispin Glover) is a complete loser who is still been stepped on by Biff Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson) the same guy who's been bullying him since high school. These things are the least of Marty's problems though when he is accidentally sent back to 1955 in his friend Doc Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) plutonium powered Delorean time machine, and jeopardises his own existence when he inadvertently interferes with his parents first meeting.The movie is huge fun. The cast is great. Fox and Lloyd are superb in their roles, as are the rest of the cast, and the plot itself is storytelling at it's finest. Not one single wasted moment. Every moment advances plot and character. Throwaway lines or minor moments usually have an important part to play in the story later on. It's hard to think of another movie that successfully blends so many genres together, if at all. Sci-fi, Comedy, Action, Romance, this has it all and it's great entertainment from start to finish.Many things about the movie have become iconic, from the Delorean, the quotes, and of course, Fox performing Johnny B.Goode. It's full of wit and clever ideas, and has aged superbly like fine wine.It has something for people of all ages, whether you're 5 or 85 it's a charming movie that has a lot to offer.",Back to the Future
553,michel_broeders,Great scott! 30 years! We're getting old Marty!,8,14 September 2015,"Back to the Future (1985), an eighties classic, is already celebrating its thirtieth birthday this year which makes it the perfect opportunity to review this 'popcornflick'. Back to the Future was written (together with Bob Gale) and directed by the now famous Robert Zemeckis. Together with Spielberg they proved that eighties films could have cheese all over it while still being a whole lotta fun. Assisted by a top-notch cast in the likes of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, Back to the Future became the quintessential 1980s flick that inventively combined a funny script, with action, science fiction and romance, that brings joy to both children and well... big children. It's present time, or at least it was in 1985, and we are introduced to the teenager Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, who lives together with his rather nerdy parents. Though his household sometimes feels like a funhouse, Marty tries to escape from his boring life through his friendship with the eccentric Dr. Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. Dr. Brown appears to be some sort of inventor and can only be described as the lovechild of Einstein and Stokowski. With the time-traveling DeLorean created by Dr. Brown, Marty is send back in time to make sure his parents will still fall in love... again and to stop his own existence from being endangered. Back to the Future plays with the fact that teenagers believe their parents were never teenagers. How could Marty's parents have ever been teenagers if they don't understand their own son? Luckily Dr. Brown has the perfect solution and Marty travels back in time to meet his 'teenage' parents. Without spoiling the plot in detail it's quite the encounter. Let it be faith or luck, it seemed almost as if Michael J. Fox wouldn't become synonymous with his role of Marty McFly. Due scheduling clashes it was nearly a certainty that Eric Stoltz would play the now famous part. Although Stoltz is very capable in his own respect it's a blessing they found a solution to Fox's busy schedule. Michael j. Fox plays Marty with an unique and energetic charm for which he is known and it works brilliantly. In addition, the chemistry Fox and Lloyd share on screen is one of a kind, their friendship feels so natural that it is a true pleasure to withhold. This friendship is indeed one of the reasons why Back to the Future works so well and still holds up to its time. But even more importantly for its success, is the way in which the film has fun with the paradoxes and difficulties of a kid meeting his own parents. And if this alone wasn't enough we are faced with many running gags of the changes that happened in 30 years.In 1985 Spielberg gave us besides Back to the Future two other productions: ""The Goonies"" and ""Explorers"". It leaves us wonder if Spielberg, at the peak of his science fiction/adventure heyday, tried to imitate the great studio executives of Golden Hollywood, who were known for matching the right director to the right film. Robert Zemeckis and Back to the Future proved to be a match made in heaven. His big breakthrough is the perfect blend of everything cinema stands for. It's made with such an unforgettable spirit you only wish they made more like these today. Too much nostalgia? Oh well...",Back to the Future

At the moment I watched this film, I realized the value of old movies. At the same time I comes to want to watch more movies.

556,benjaminmadsen,One of the Greats,8,19 March 2019,Back to the Future. What a great movie. Shame that I have to write a review for it for my History Through Film class. So this movie is really good and while I sit in 2019 and get to look at the 1980s and the 1960s which I think is pretty cool. The movie has one of the best stories in all of cinema. The movie is funny and makes you feel good. The music by Alan Slyvestri is fitting and the acting is really good. Christopher Lloyd's Doc Brown was funny and was perfect for the part. I have never been in the 80s or the 60s but I think they were accurately portrayed in this movie. This movie has a lot of quotable lines which I enjoy. I would recommend that everyone should see this movie at least once.,Back to the Future
557,slammerps,The best movie of all TIME,10,11 January 2001,"It's about a character who begins with one view of his life and reality, and is allowed, through magical intervention, to discover another. A classic fish out of water story. I think what makes this movie so great is the people involved.Robert Zemeckis is one of the best sci-fi directors of our time. It's funny how it takes a big budget movie like Cast Away (2000) to make people take notice.FOX & LLoyd should win the nobel prize for chemistry. Brown is overexcited in his speeches, and his exaggerated facial expressions put Vince McMahon's (WWF) to shame.And Thomas Willson (BIFF) & Crispin Glover (George McFly) gave it their all, including possibly the best performances of their life.Back to the future is one of those movies where you believe in the characters, as much comic book as they are, and as hard as you try, you just can't pick a favorite. It's a popcorn movie that can be watched over and over again.

I can tell you Doc Brown's address both in the past and the present. I know what kind of dog food Einstein eats. I know this movie better than ""Holy Grail"", and that's saying something.

Popular with the younger generation because of how it's about the younger generation and also popular with older people because of many reasons.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod are the stars of this movie about an 18 year old boy who has mostly everything going for him. a hot girlfriend, talented musician but not brilliant in his school life with a certain teacher who has a dislike for him because of his family who went to that school before. Until his friend the brilliant, but a bit mental scientist Dr. Emmett Brown tells Marty to meet him at 1am to show him his latest invention, A time-machine, but something goes wrong and it results in Marty ending up 30 years earlier in 1955. His only hope of getting back to the future is to get help from a younger Dr.Emmett Brown. While in 1955 he runs into the younger version of his parents and makes a mistake which could erase his own existence.It's a bit of a confusing storyline which still confuses people to this day. But that is just good writing. Written and Directed by Robert Zemecks and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg.It won an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing and was nominated for three others, with a rating of 8.5/10 puts itself at number 45 in the Top 250 and is critically acclaimed as one of the best movies of the 80s this movie is my 2nd of all time favorite and without a doubt one of the best movies ever made.",Back to the Future

None of this changes the way I feel about these movies if you haven't watched them you should if you haven't showed them to your kids you should once their old enough hopefully they won't understand the whole incest part of it I know it's not reallly incest because they didn't do anything but they thought it at least Lorraine did even if Marty didn't because he knew but it all is weird,Back to the Future

His father keeps getting bullied by his supervisor, Biff (Wilson), his mother is an alcoholic and his elder siblings don't seem to have any aim in life. He has be-friended the local crazy scientist, Dr. Brown (Lloyd) whom the entire town considers to be mentally unstable. Dr. Brown has managed to create a time machine by modifying a DeLorean which needs a speed of 88 mph before it can travel through time and which also uses Plutonium. Dr. Brown had stolen the Plutonium from the Libyans and whilst showing Marty the functioning of the device, the Libyans attack Dr. Brown and Marty manages to escape back in time to the year 1955. Since he was out of Plutonium, Marty could not go back to the actual year and hence needed to find the younger Dr. Brown and take his help in going back to the future. 1955 was the year when Marty's father George (Glover) fell in love with his mother Lorraine (Thompson) but sadly, Lorraine takes a liking towards Marty himself. Marty realises that if he comes in the way of his parents, he might alter the future altogether to the point that he himself would seize to exist. The movie is a hardcore science-fiction movie that is a complete entertainment package. Although the story and developments might come across as being clichéd, the movie has some very good twists and a gripping climax to make this movie a wonderful watch. Many sci-fi movies end up looking too cheesy because of bad execution of the 'futuristic technology' but this movie seems to pull it off with ease which looks believable even 27 years later.

568,Neonfinity,Back to The Shack,10,26 September 2017,"Back To The Future is a 1985 film directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson. The film was distributed by Universal, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Comedy Adventure. I have seen the film many times before on different formats.The film takes place in 1985, Marty (Fox) is accidentally sent to 1955 by means of a time-traveling DeLorean. Due to the very limited plutonium supply the DeLorean had, he needs to find Doc (Lloyd) to get the DeLorean up and running again. Along the way he meets his own father (Glover) during his high school years. Marty realizes that it is his destiny to unite his Mom & Dad at the ""Enchantment Under The Sea"" dance. I love almost every single actor's performance in this. Every single character, no matter how small, gets an arc. For example, Goldie Wilson (Donald Fullilove) is running for his 2nd term as Mayor in 1985. In 1955, Wilson gets the confidence to run as mayor from Marty. Fox's charisma as Marty is unprecedented and is one of the best audience surrogates in all of film history. Lloyd has the performance of a lifetime, stealing every scene he is in. I love BttF, it will always remain as a classic as time goes on. It's representation of time-travel is almost flawless. The characters are amazing as goes with the story and with the writing and direction. The only nitpick I have is that some of the green-screen effects look dated but that's it. Themes of BttF include love, destiny, and coincidence. The main theme song is ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis & The News if that doesn't tell you anything. Destiny and Coincidence play a huge part in here seeing as George McFly doesn't get the courage to ask Lorraine out to the dance until Marty enters their lives.This film has reached a lot of people then and certainly has now and will only be more widely known as time goes on. General Audiences love it, Kids love it, and Adults cherish it. The only people who would hate it are hipsters who think there are no great films, only overrated ones.

What separates this from any other sci-fi movie is the constant humor and more than anything, the fun that everyone so clearly had in making it.

He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres.

This movie was done with style, and will always be the best sci-fi movie around. The acting is remarkable; Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are the standouts in the film. Fox does a wonderful job portraying the average 80s teenager, while Lloyd made his voice heard in his career best performance. As for Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, they add another ring to the story, and give it comedy, a rare occurance in science fiction. There are several things that I could note telling how good this movie was. The concept of traveling through time has never exactly done well in the theatres before, but ""Back to the Future"" worked, as did its sequels. The small things also made this movie what it is today, like how realistic the 1950s were. During those scenes, you can imagine it being a 50s movie done in color. Also, the usage of the Delorean seemed like the perfect car for the time machine. To sum things up, I quote Doc, talking about the Delorean used for the time machine.

Unlike so many movies from the mid-80's, the story is timeless, there is not too much emphasis on fads at the time, the fashions etc are all very low key.. which in hindsight is a bit of genius considering it may have been tempting to show the 80's characters in the wild fashions of the time to contrast with the 50's look.. And the future view also still stands up as being modern! Although, ahem, flying cars by 2015? Doesn't seem so realistic now :) Anyway.. love them all.. the 2nd has that great futuristic look and re-recreates the scenes from the original movie brilliantly!

I was a child from the 80's, and remember these movies well, and I also remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like. It wasn't, at least not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be happening in our reality any time soon). It was just a lot of fun to sit there and think that back in the 80's, people really thought our world was going to change THAT drastically. Lots of fun scenes. Anyway, I haven't seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through the years, and the movie doesn't look like your typical 80's film either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing, yuck!) I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to the year 1955 for quite a long time. Talk about telling a story with lots of twists and turns. Awesome! These are seriously some of the most exciting movies that have ever existed. The first movie is a classic, and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series. Maybe, maybe not. I don't really know. I just know I love these films and wanted to comment on how well they've held up after all this time. A series of movies that are worth watching over and over again, and I normally only watch movies once or twice. Not in this case.",Back to the Future
590,dudemisra,A classic for all the ages,10,23 November 2019,"Back to the Future, in its 80s cheese, stands out for its cultural influence and iconic storyline. It's a film no one can help but smile about, definitely due to the optimistic and adventurous aura this film radiates.Michael J. Fox plays cool kid Marty McFly who is living life like his last whilst living with a family that seems to barely survive or live anymore. His weak-willed father and depressed mother along with his no-good brother and sister find themselves between a rock and a hard place with Marty in very middle. Fortunately Marty's crazy yet brilliant scientist friend Doc. Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd has one solution to change the fate of Marty and his family's life: To go back to the future.The film is definitely interesting in that its storyline is very cheesy and cliched which is all acceptable given the period this film was released. Yet, even viewing this film now in the 2010s, we aren't affected negatively by how cheesy or corny certain scenes or dialogue are because its what makes this film unique. The over-the-top hysterics of Doc Brown and his time traveling theories, Biff and his gang chasing Marty across Hill Valley square and certainly the sequence of Doc Brown trying to connect the big clock with a cable power point before Marty in the DeLorean strikes it. Its scenes like these that people remember 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 year or hell after 10 years simply because only Back to the Future can execute them with perfection.I'm not bluffing when I'm saying anyone of any age MUST watch this film. Whether you're a middle aged adult, this film will bring back memories as you ponder on the freedom and energy of your youth with refreshing optimism. Even watching this film as a teen, you feel a sense of urgency to live life the way Marty does in this film; always on an adventure, being the coolest or popular anywhere you go or just learning how to be a great friend like Marty is to George, his father. This film is filled with hidden life lessons on how to treat yourself and those around you.I believe that even as the 21st century comes to an end, people will still remember or talk about this film because there is nothing or there will be nothing like it ever.",Back to the Future

Still, until that day arrives, we have Back to the Future to reminiscent off of.  Back to the Future was a great movie.  The teen style McFly mixed with a doc inventing everything from anything.  Going into the past was so cool.  Everyone wishes they could visit their heritage, so this movie did it for us.  Robert Zemeckis did a wonderful job on this flick.  My only con, is that they didn't explore more avenues.  For example, jumping into the Roman times, or even the Egyptian times.  Although, to be fair, they didn't actually get the chance according to the storyline, so it's really nobody's fault.  I gave this movie a rating of 9/10.",Back to the Future

Every scene in this movie is a winner. Probably this movie works because it never takes itself seriously. From start to finish the movie contains an amazing wealth of visual gags (the giant guitar speaker, the DeLorean time machine), classic lines (""You can't have a Pepsi Free. You gotta pay for it."") and in-jokes (rocker Huey Lewis complaining that the music is too loud). The time travel logic, so hard to pull off, is done with great flair, suitable for any science fiction movie. Except this isn't a sci-fi film. It's a comedy with a heavy dose of social satire mixed in and it works on both levels.Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly a teenager who would rather play guitar than do anything else. He's friendly with the town's off-the-wall inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd.) Doc creates a time machine and Marty is accidentally transported back to the year 1955. There he meets a younger version of his parents (Crispin Glover and Leah Thompson) and has to arrange for them to meet so they will get married and have him.The role of Marty McFly was ideal for Michael J. Fox. His ability to play a teenager transferred perfectly from TV (Family Ties) to the big screen. Crispin Glover is terrific as Marty's father, George McFly. He has a dual role, as a teenager and an adult. Christopher Lloyd is almost over-the-top as the nutty inventor. Thomas Wilson is Biff, the bully who constantly torments George McFly.Other than Forrest Gump this is Robert Zemeckis's best movie. Kids and adults will appreciate it.",Back to the Future

Huge shout out to Tom Wilson who plays Biff as well, for being the best movie bully of all time.Now, this film- while being the best thing ever made- ever- is not without its flaws... the opening amp sequence is a bit goofy and out of character with the rest of the film, and Crispen Glover's performance may be too outlandish for some people (personally, I love him in this movie).I'm not sure that this movie is going to stand the test of time- You may have had to live through the 80s to fully appreciate the contrasting attitudes and behaviors of Marty and the people of 1955. I think the film holds up fine right now, but I wonder in 20 years if people will still appreciate its subtleties. In brief, this movie is the most fun thing I've ever watched.

There are great suspenseful scenes, and the overall quality of the acting and sound/special effects (considering the time of production) are really amazing. I don't see much history in it, as it is not the main focus of the movie in the first place. Marty starts out in the 1980's and ends up in the 1950's.The only criticism I have is the fact that the ""scientific"" aspect of this movie is too ignored. It would have been nice to see a discussion about space-time continuum and the dangerous effects of altering the smallest things.One of my favorite things about this movie is the fact that there are a lot of references to Marty's time when he goes to the 1950's. It's very entertaining. However, I do wish the social differences of the 1950's were a bigger point.Overall, a really great movie and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.

The history part of this movie that interest me is that it shows the differences between the two time periods, such in clothing, cars, places, buildings. My favorite part was when Martys' mom found him attractive. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, I would definitely watch it again .",Back to the Future
600,fanny92,Childhood Movie,10,6 February 2019,"This movie is a classic and one of my favorites. I used to watch it when I was little and it has always been a family favorite. It has a fun story line and a very interesting concept. It has many great scenes. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Marty, the main character, realizes that he is in 1955 instead of 1985 and he meets his dad and Biff.
This movie is about Marty, a high school student, and his friend, Dr. Brown, a scientist, who creates a time machine in the form of a car. Marty gets transported from 1985 to the past in 1955. He meets his parents who are then in high school and he has to get his mom to fall in love with his dad so that he will still exist in the future.
The history in this movie is interesting because it kind of compares the 50's era with the 80's era. I knew about both eras before; mostly what the styles in clothing were. I really like the way they compared the two eras using the contrast between Marty who was from the 80's and his parents who were from the 50's and how they interacted with each other. It made me wonder what it would be like if I went to the past and met my parents.
The director of this movie is Robert Zemeckis. I have seen a couple of the movies he has made and thought that they were well made. The main actors are Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, and Crispin Glover. I haven't seen any other movies that I know of with these actors in it, but I am familiar with the actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. I enjoyed all of these actors in this show and thought they did a great acting job. My favorite scene from this movie was when Marty gets hit by his grandpa's car and meets his mom for the first time as a teenager. It was a well done scene because it set up the problem that Marty had to fix.
I just overall love this movie. It brings back great memories from when I was young. It is fun to follow and it has a different plot that really makes you think about what it would be like if something similar happened to you. I would recommend this to people who like science fiction and who just want a good laugh and fun movie to watch.",Back to the Future

609,s_daad,The definitive time travel adventure,8,21 October 2010,"The secret of Back To The Future is its madcap pace. Any film about time travel must be like that, because any pause will expose the implausibility of it all, and that’s disastrous. The first Terminator couldn’t afford to stop anywhere because if it did the plot becomes laughable. Non-stop action is easier to handle than comedy, because with comedy you are always mired in the time-travel ramifications, instead of side-stepping it as they do in an action flick. It’s even more difficult for Back To The Future because it takes those ramifications head on. The hero has to save himself from non-existence after he has accidentally stopped his parents from meeting each other. So it’s not just pace that makes this film work, but also ingenuity. The plot is devilishly ingenious, and ingenuity keeps popping up in other forms too throughout the film, in cross-cultural references, in incestuous asides, in time travel in-jokes etc. it’s all helped by perfect casting and great performances, particularly Christopher Lloyd as the mad scientist Doc Brown, also good were Michael J. Fox, Lea Thomson and Crispin Glover. The cinematography is excellent too. Walking back in time appears palpable. The ending is lame, however. There was no need to have a significantly altered present when Marty comes back home. The whole point was not to change the present, so the film loses a lot of credibility here. But it doesn’t take away from the joyous ride of the last 2 hours. This film became one of the most popular films of all time, and it’s on the strength of its quality alone.The only thing I don’t understand is why they decided to make a sequel. When I sat down to watch BTTF 2 I knew I was heading for a disaster zone. I mean, if it took so much effort and ingenuity just to suspend disbelief in the first one, it’s an impossible task to keep it going for two more films. Sooner or later we are bound to be troubled by plausibility issues, and that spoils everything. I was absolutely right, and watching 2 was depressing and excruciating. Mind you, I can’t commend the makers highly enough for trying, but what’s impossible is impossible. 2 contains an even more ingenious plot, but it still ends up as utterly ridiculous, and indeed becomes an insult to the first. The first allowed us to indulge in the fantasy of “what if”. The second has us tangled in a mathematical web of “ifs” and “thens”, and this leaves no scope for fantasy. Gems like Back To The Future need to be preserved from the contamination of sequelitis. But Hollywood is a place where money rules, so I shouldn’t be fussy.",Back to the Future

How does this time machine work? Marty asks. Well it's the good old flux capacitor, Dr. Brown ""explains."" In the original ""Time Machine"" movie, scientific explanations are even lamer. How does it work? Push the lever forward you go into the future; push it back and you go into the past! Why, thank you! It's perfectly clear now. No, no. There is no real science in ""Back to the Future."" The technological premise is a mere excuse to ruminate on the vicissitudes of fate and the possibility of doing something very difficult but crucial: changing your history. Marty learns that, maybe--just maybe--if you go beyond yourself and do something beyond what you think you can, beyond what you have seemingly been set up by fate to do, then you can change history--fate--not only for your self but for others as well, for your progeny, your family. Thus the real hero of this morality tale is not Marty but the old man. With Marty's help, he eventually stands up to Biff, something he never did the first time around and everything changes! The family is now hip and smart, classy, loving and cool! When I first saw that last scene (and when I still see it today), a tear of humanistic joy comes to my eye. The whole family is redeemed for at least a generation, because George learns a Hemingway lesson: a coward dies a thousand deaths, but a brave man only one.

614,ThePeruvianPost,Don't be so gullible Mcfly !,10,11 July 2019,"""Steven Spielberg remains the beating heart of modern science-fiction films, and if you want to find any reasons why then, I suggest you to watch this instant-classic movie at once, you will comprehend the legacy he has brought to us.""The first time I have ever redacted a critic on this website was down in 2015, since then I learned impressively how productions could change lives and start movements throughout the world. Back to The Future represents one of those motion pictures: such a powerful, inspirational, comical, encouraging, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film, which, by the way, could end up being top-notch of all time. There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be wondering about the reason why I consider it as pure perfection. First and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back to The Future follows the proper steps in order to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping for. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and average moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win, basically, the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains, therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as a Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson relationship in Wedding Crashers (2004), I daresay. Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and at the streets, not forgetting the genuine pop-culture references introduced.In conclusion, Steven Spielberg's mind is proof that everyone is capable of creating instant classics, delivering the audience such an awesome time.

He travels through time in a modified DeLorean car. Things go wrong when he finds his parents back in the 50's. He had to make them fall in love with one another so the future goes as planned and he's born. If his parents don't fall in love, he won't exist.
A Lot of the movies made back then that were about teens, look like they've been set in between the 50's-70's. The clothing the people wore back in the movie portraying 50's clothing was, I think, fairly accurate. The clothing style was kind of like bowling meets disco (somewhere in between the two.) Robert Zemeckis was the director of back to the future. He's directed a ton of other movies. I've seen a few of the movies directed by him, but not a lot. I've seen A Christmas Carol, The Polar Express, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and lastly Forrest Gump. They were all super great movies and all so popular, as well as back to the future is. Forrest Gump is easily the best movie i've watched that was directed by Robert. It's more into the genre that I preferably watch whereas all the other ones are more kiddie movies (except for back to the future, that one's kinda for just about anybody, lol). What I liked about this movie was the clothing they wore in the time setting. I love movies with clothing from the 50's all the way to the 2000's really.

The style of talk and dress looks to be accurate to that time period.

621,DaveW-3,The most entertaining blockbuster ever.,8,10 April 1999,"Inventive, powerful, and wildly good fun, Back to the Future (BTTF) is an amazing film. Pulling off fun jokes and exciting set pieces with ease, BTTF follows the adventures of Marty McFly, as he travels back in time to 1955 to try and get his parents to fall in love. Christopher Lloyd is suitable manic as the off centre Doc Brown, the inventor of the sleek time machine, and Crispin Glover is an absolute standout as the nerdy George McFly. Lea Thompson is memorable as Marty's mom who falls in love with Marty in 1955 (leading to some great gags) and writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale ensure the film goes at full speed, and Huey Lewis provides a great anthem in the form of 'The Power of Love.' The sequels never matched the whimsy on display here, and for anyone who enjoys rollicking sci-fi, BTTF is the ultimate good time.",Back to the Future
622,spyder7,Proof that Hollywood once was capable of putting magic on film,9,23 October 2005,"I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong.",Back to the Future
623,dozer200,Well thought out plan,10,2 July 2000,This movie is a classic. One of my top ten movies of all time. The whole trilogy is great. I could never figure out why they never made a trilogy box for this series. This is definetly one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion and in other opinions. Who wouldve thought a Deolorian could take you so far. The whole trilogy is well thought out and the effects are excellent even for today. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best.,Back to the Future

I grew up wanting to be like Michael J. Fox, and this movie was a big reason why. He's a stud!The attention to detail in this movie, and the sequels, is one of the reasons why it is so great. I love time-travel movies, but this is the best one by far.Christopher Lloyd & Crispin Glover are excellent in their roles. There is so much to like about this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to see it again. Along with Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi, this is my favorite movie made in the '80's.",Back to the Future

628,ben9909,I wanna be like Mike,10,13 January 2002,"After i saw this movie, i really have enjoyed watching Michael J.Fox's productions and movies, he just had that cliche that was both entertaining and brought that extra ""oomph"" into a film.An excellent story line was the trick here, The element of ""What if...""? It is everyones fanatasy to go back and see when their Mother and Father met, knowing that from that moment they were ment for each other. The element of romance, close calls, the ugly duckling nursery rhyme theme, comedy, suspense and that touch of drama were the ingredients that made Back To The Future a non-stop adrenaline ride. Though it takes it a while to get the started, its pace keeps hounding until the fimal scene. Excellent cast, stand out performance by Crispin Glover, and Lea Thompson, Michael J. Fox excellent as Marty McFly, and Christopher Lloyd as the excentric Doc Brown made this movie golden. If you havent seen it, do yourself a favor - go see it, you'll be glad you did, it will make you want to get Back to the future over and over again.A fantastic storyline and excellent direction, a dynamic cast.*****""OUTOF""*****Terrific",Back to the Future
629,emarkay,How many gigawatts do you need?,8,10 October 2002,"Hollywood at it's best.... Pop fluff to take your mind off reality for a few hours. This is actually a rather good film, script and acting performance; so simple that the average teenager of the 1980's would recommend it to his friends, sequels would be cranked out, t-shirts would be made, and a theme park ride would honor it's legacy.Isn't that what it was (and still is) all about?",Back to the Future
630,happyakazukin,Good fun,8,26 April 2009,"Okay, let's look at this objectively. The filming is the only thing that doesn't stand out. It does it's job to convey a point, and that's it. No eye boggling cinematography here.The music is memorable and enhances the scenes immensely. Great catchy, well varied songs that make you feel what the characters are: Earth Angel and Johnny B. Goode come to mind. 9/10 It's rare to have memorable characters in film since little details get washed over, but BTTF's plot is highly character based, which works in being entertaining as well as informative. You'll remember all the names of these characters. 9/10 The plot itself is quite simple, but well executed. It's fun with all the different genres. 7/10 The acting is excellent. Chris Lloyd's performance is very over the top and eccentric, but memorable all the same. Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson's performances are very honest and moving. 9/10In terms of entertainment I find all the foreshadowing (1985) a little dull, but it's impossible to delete it since it introduces all the characters. The script is very tight and well written, the tension builds as the film goes along.I've watched this a few times so I'd say the re-watch value is very good.",Back to the Future
631,MaryBoAmptmeijer,"Nice classic, not a masterpiece",7,9 November 2020,"So for me, I never watched this movie growing up. I just saw it for the first time, i amediately figured why people love it so much. It's funny, has some nice shots in it and the story is enjoyable. It just wasn't as good as I expected, filming could be better and some little touches here and there would have made it a masterpiece. It just seems when there is no sentimental value, the movie is just good and fun and not amazing. Overall really enjoyed it and it still is a nice family movie",Back to the Future
632,Spoffdarko,My favourite film of all time.,10,20 May 2019,"The best film ever made.I really cannot convey how much I love Back to the Future. I was born in 1976 so was the perfect age for when this was released at the Cinema. I spent my pocket money on ""Back to the Future everything"" sticker book, poster, pencil case for school, skateboard, you name it! I think I saw it about 5 times at my local Cinema, and then at least another 5 on VHS when it was released. I literally bugged the guy at the Video store not to sell it to anyone else when he was done with renting it out. I saved up and bought the ex-rental video from him when he got a new copy and watched it pretty much constantly!Everything about BttF is perfect. The story, the cast, the score, the locations, the De Lorean! BttF is a pure time-capsule (no pun intended) that whisks me back to being 9 years old again.Michael J Fox is wonderful as Marty in his break-out movie role, and I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of Doc Brown with the perfection that Christopher Lloyd did. The rest of the cast are also extremely strong, everyone brings their game here to make the best film possible, and it shows.Both Bob's (Zemeckis and Gale) created absolute magic and captured it on film, there will literally never be another one like this. I know Bob Zemeckis was awarded the best director Oscar for Forrest Gump, but for me, Back to the Future will always be his crowning achievement. Alan Silvestri and Huey Lewis and the News added the cherry to the top of this wonderful cake with their fantastic score and music contributions! We also cannot forget Steven Spielberg, without him, Back to the Future may never have been made.If you are any kind of movie fan then BttF is a must. The fun and downright excellence of this film just shines through in every scene, it is infectious. You can tell that everyone had a great time making it!BttF also has the best cliff-hanger third act of any film I have ever seen! I still sit on the edge of my seat even now, and I must have seen it 50 times (Will Marty and Doc's plan succeed?).I showed it to my 7 year old son last weekend, and whilst he did not understand all of it, he loved watching it. There is a reason why Back to the Future became wildly popular, has stood the test of time, and is loved by different generations all around the world. The reason is because it takes the viewer through every emotion that a great film should, one moment you are basking in the cool of it all, the next you are laughing, the next you are on the edge of your seat. That, is visual storytelling at it's best!Extra bonus points must be awarded for making the Time Machine a DeLorean, this was an inspired and genius idea. The design of the Time Machine is second to none, it looks exactly like you would think a Time Machine should, and is, by my reckoning, the coolest car in cinema history. Pulling a car with such a troubled history from relative obscurity, and turning it into one of the most recognizable in the world was a master-stroke.I think being there in 1985 the first time around gives me a particularly special relationship with Back to the Future, but everyone should see it at least once, as I said, I think it is the best film ever made, and the collective work is the best trilogy ever made!Thank you to everyone who came together to make the Back to the Future trilogy happen. You gave us something really incredible, unique, and timeless!",Back to the Future
633,rctguy75,"A ""Timeless"" Classic! One of the best movies ever made!",9,6 February 2017,"""Are you telling me that you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?"" Yes Marty McFly, in fact, that is your famous quote from one of the best movies, Back to the Future. Ever since I saw this movie, it has always been one of my favorites. Everything about this movie is great, from the cast, to the story, to the many marvelous one- liners. With all that being said, let us travel back to 1985 and Marty McFly's misadventures in Back to the Future!Marty McFly is a 1985 teenager who is called on by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown to come to the mall at 1:30 am to see his latest invention. Apparently, using plutonium that he stole, Doc was able to harness the power of the material to power a DeLorean car. The catch, the DeLorean is a time machine. However, Doc is shot down by the terrorists whom he stole the plutonium from. Marty gets in the DeLorean and attempts to escape. However, he accidentally gets up to 88 mph, and is transported back to 1955. Marty thinks he is in a dream, until he comes across the future mayor as a sweeper in a diner. Marty then finds his dad, and interferes with his meeting with his mom. Suddenly, Marty finds his mom, who seems to have the hots for him. Marty is able to find Doc and gets Doc to believe that he is from the future. Doc tells Marty that his interference with his parents meeting might cause him to never exist. Marty plans to get his parents together while allowing Doc to get him back to 1985. They eventually come up with a plan: using the exact time that a bolt of lightning will strike the clock tower, Doc will set up a wire that will transport the lightning's power into the DeLorean as it reaches 88 mph, sending Marty back to the future. At the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, Marty is able to get his parents together, and his plan to warn Doc that he will be killed that night in 1985 fails as Doc tears up the letter saying it will be catastrophic in the space-time continuum. Their plan is a success, and Marty is transported back to 1985. To his surprise, Doc taped Marty's note back together and wore a bullet-proof vest to protect himself. When Marty asks for an explanation, Doc says ""I figured, what the hell.""What makes this movie great? Let's start with the cast. Without a doubt, Marty McFly and Doc Brown are two of the best movie leads ever! They have great chemistry together, and both pull off some very memorable one-liners. My personal favorite is Doc's line: ""Great Scott!"" The supporting cast is also great. Marty's dad and mom are very quirky and very funny. Some of the scenes, like when Marty disguises himself as Darth Vader from Planet Vulcan, are some of my favorites ever in any movie.The story of the film is also very inventive. This was the definitive time travel movie, and still is to this day. Loaded with some still impressive special effects, the story is very real and an absolute gem to watch.In my opinion, Back to the Future is an instant classic film. With great characters, an extremely inventive story, and eye-popping effects, Back to the Future has truly supplanted itself among some of the best movies of all time. While it is only #12 on my personal favorite movies list, there is no doubt that this is a movie that anyone can pick up and watch. Back to the Future gets a 9/10!!! See this movie if you have not!!!",Back to the Future

The filmmaker is telling you that they thought you could time travel and that there would be flying cars in the future. I also think the filmmaker is telling us that we dint want to be in high school with our parents. I already knew some of the music in this part of history and the cars they drove and the things they wore. Yes I have seen other movies in this part of history. Something that is similar is that we both have cars. Yes I have seen all of the back to the futures. I think that this is a good movie and I would watch movies with these actors before. I liked how it showed us the 1950's and the 1980's. I didn't like how the mom and the son had a weird relationship back in the 50's. Yes I would watch this movie outside of school because I have seen it before. I would recommend this to friends if they were into this type of film.,Back to the Future

The showing was awesome, there were so many other fans, there was clapping during just about every scene.Now for the film. The film follows a really simple plot (which is rare for most time travel adventures). The jokes seem new every time I watch the film. They're always hilarious. And I have to credit the Amazing Cast and Writers for that.For a Comedy, the movie packs a lot of suspense, the climax is beautifully put together with its race against time situation.And what else can I say that hasn't already been said?

By that I mean that you can test the logic defined by the rules set in the film, and it stands up from all angles. Most time travel movies break their rules somewhere. Sometimes it's forgivable, sometimes it's not. But Back to the Future (and its sequels) is as close as I've seen to the perfect logic in a time travel movie. The writers clearly thought this through from all aspects. They defined the rules of time travel that they were going to use (of which there are several to choose from) and they wrote the story around those rules, rather than just making a time travel movie and not thinking through the ramifications of what the characters do.This movie and its sequels remains to this day my absolutely favorite movie(s) of all time. All other time travel movies pale in comparison.",Back to the Future
647,josechr,Yeah.. no...,4,31 December 2019,"I digged this movie as a kid. It was crazy scientists and fun action. And nobody could envision what the future would look like. Now, I'm in my fourties, the era they travelled to has passed, and I watched this again.First, nothing in this movie feels realistic. The family of Marty feel like a bad fever dream of a horrific past. Caricature dynamics that hammer in how crap of a life the ""kid"" has (Michael J. Fox was in his middle thirties at he time). The professor angle, well, nobody over 10-years old buy into that guy. He build a fantastical time machine out of a car for crissakes, an doesn't seem to understand anything about how something works, except through magic and unbelievable ""epinaphies"". They have an adventure, albeit, magical in nature, and learn a thing or two (banal) things about life.

648,yet,Fun...and prescient,9,12 October 2010,"Back to the Future and its two following parts take the time travel genre from HG Wells social criticism to social satire and beyond. While chock-full of '80s cues (the dress, designer labels/celebrities and Pepsi Free-remember that?), the film still manages to be eerily prescient. In 2015 you may buy a ""Mr. Fusion"" portable reactor that produces at least 1.2 gigawatts, but your flying car still runs on gas pumped at the Texaco station. What does that say about EV cars in the next few years? OK, there are no hover boards...but flat-panel TVs have all but erased tubes from memory, there's Major League baseball in Miami (or will be shortly) and the social decline of ""traditional"" white, middle-class suburbia is already widespread. And unlike those ""other"" depictions of the '50s, it wasn't all bobby-socks and sax; there was sex (and rape) too.

This film contains very dynamic characters (Marty and Doc) along with a few static ones (Biff). Spielberg's writing hits its mark once again by making a story with wonder but one that we can all connect with on personal levels. This movie it very fitting of being label as a classic that everyone sees.
While this movie is great, there is a few flaws. There is that classic 1980s super close up face shots that I cannot stand. Another problem with the movie is again an issue I have with a lot of 80s era movies, which is bad sound design.

It starts out with the blues but morphs into rock. The main plot of the story is that a kid goes back in time and accidentally messes up a few things. Which he then later has to fix or his life will be all messed up. The movie was set in the 80's then changed to the 50's when Marty goes back in time. What was interesting to me about the history was one, their clothes, and two their day to day life. I have seen a lot of movies set in the 50's and few are my personal favorite. Obviously a lot has changed when it comes to our daily life, but a few things have stayed consistent. Like high school for example had almost stayed the same. The director of the film is Robert Zemeckis, I have not seen any other movies that have been directed by him. I know two actors that are in this film, Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox. Christopher Lloyd was Doc Brown and Michael J Fox was Marty, I have seen both of them in other movies. I love both of these actors and I think that they do an amazing job in this movie as well as others. Another favorite scene of mine is the Marty on skateboard vs Bif and truck scene.

The script is perfect, there are an amazing number of details from the 1980's which track to the 1950's which make it a delight to watch more than once.  Michael J. Fox does a terrific job, this role was made for him.  His family is a riot, with Christian Glover playing an excellent nerdy father.  It is a combination comedy and science fiction. It also raises some questions about how simple acts in our everyday lives can have determine our destiny.",Back to the Future

662,thegoods7,Still awesome,9,24 January 2012,"This movie is magnificent. The directing and actor are superb. originally director Robert Zemeckis had chosen Eric Stoltz to play the part of Marty McFly and I think we're all glad that he then chose Michael J. Fox to play Marty instead. This movie really makes you pay attention to detail and takes you into the realization that Marty is hanging out with his parents when they were kids, and they play off that whole not fitting in with the time with his clothes and making the film funny by talking about him, his family, and the future. This movie shows something that everyone wants to do in their lifetime, which is time travel and this is a great way to show it. Back to the Future is definitely a movie that will never get old and will always be enjoyable.",Back to the Future

The science fiction storyline is so hilariously captivating that you easily find yourself caught up in cheering for the good guys and hating the bad boy, Biff. Back to the Future is certainly engaging, too, as many of us have wished at some point in our lives for a chance to alter our future. The characters are likable, memorable and admirable. My favorite is definitely Christopher Lloyd who is thoroughly entertaining and adorable as Doc Brown. He and Michael J.

Fox is funny & talented having seen him perform on television and in film, his character Marty McFly is a typical 1980's teenager whose about to go on the most unexpected journey of his life. Other cast members include Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Wendie Jo Sperber, Thomas F.

666,byrocow,One of the best movies ever made,10,4 July 2020,"35 years ago this week, one of the best blockbusters (and movies period) was released. This is my top 3 favorite movies (whenever someone ask what my favorite movie is I always say empire strikes back, raiders of the lost ark and this film) this movie follows 1985 high schooler Marty Mcfly (played by Michael J Fox) who has hopes and dreams of being in a band and having a better life but his family life sucks, his parents don't like each other and it's invaded by Biff (one of the best movie villains played by Thomas F Wilson) and a friend of Marty's, a scientist named Doc Brown (played MASTERFULLY by Christopher Lloyd) shows him his time machine he made out of a DeLorean (the best movie car ever) he ends up getting in it and accidentally gets stuck in 1955 (where he accidentally interrupts his parents meeting and his mom has a crush on him 😬) and he has to meet younger doc brown to try to fix his parents marriage and get back home to 1985 and we have one of the best movies ever (movies like this are honestly not around anymore) first off, the characters are iconic (the chemistry and friendship between Marty and Doc and is heart of this entire trilogy) and something people don't talk as much about this the technical side of the film (it's masterfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, it's shot beautifully with shots that give me chills, it's has one of the best movie themes ever by Alan Silvestri) and this is a masterfully written film (it's a script that scene to scene is full of amazing ideas that are executed to perfection) and of course, this movie is just a BLAST to watch (it's never boring, its funny, it's exciting and it's a movie I can watch any day, any time. In fact, I watch this movie at least once or twice a year ever since I saw it when I was 6) in the end, such original and inspiring movies like this aren't made anymore (this is one of the main films that made me want to make movies and this movie changed my life) with iconic characters, amazing writing, a perfectly made film and just fun and has inspired generations of film lovers and filmmakers (including the guys writing this review) because it did actually that great.",Back to the Future
667,dickie_jonus_tsr,the best Robert Zemeckis film,8,11 August 2005,"Back to the Future is a movie I can guarantee you will enjoy. It starts off when Marty McFly gets into a lot of trouble. Including with his girlfriend and school (are you surprised?!). But then Marty realizes, his best friend, a scientist who he calls 'doc', just invented a time machine... and guess what? It actually works! But then something happens. When he is about to go to the year 1955, doc is shot by Libyain terrorists from whom he stole plutonium, the liquid that makes the time machine work. Without any choices, Marty scrambles into the car and... finds himself in the year 1955. But the story doesn't end there. Marty accidentally stops his parents (who were teenagers then) from meeting and falling in love with each other, and puts his life at risk. Because if his parents never met, that means that they never had any children. And if Marty doesn't get to get his parents to meet each other.. it means that him and his brothers will simply disappear off the face of the earth. Also, Marty and the young doc encounter another problem. Marty needs to get back to the future, and he can't as plutonium was barely known in the 1950s. So how will he do it? See and find out! This movie is simply cool. Not only is it funny, it also has an excellent script and dialog. I like the cast and the characters and I also liked the set decoration. Nearly everything about this movie is good. However, you have to pay full attention at the start to understand what happens later. But that doesn't spoil it. Rating: 7.5/10",Back to the Future

I don't want to tell too much of the storyline, (because if you haven't seen it yet, you really should) but it starts off with Marty McFly, a standard '80's teenager (the setting is 1985) with a goofy, nerdy dad, an alcoholic mom, a fast-food working older brother, and older sister who doesn't really do much at all. Marty's best friend is a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (""Doc""), who calls him and invites him to the mall parking lot at 1:15 in the morning the next day. So he goes, and Doc reveals what he has in fact spent the last 30 years inventing: a time machine. Unlike the past versions of what time machines would look like (generally a little room), Doc's time machine is in the form of a DeLorean (""the way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine out of a car, why not do it with some style!""). It has to go 88 MPH to work (along with a few other details I won't reveal now). After a series of surprises, Marty finds himself transported back in time to the year 1955. Right after he gets there, he accidentally runs into his parents (30 years younger; Marty's age now), and VERY accidentally, interferes with the event of his parents falling in love for the first time. Not thinking much of it at the time, he goes around town, looking for the one man who can help him: Doc Brown, 30 years younger. After he finds him, Doc realizes that Marty's interfering with his parents' first meeting could have VERY bad consequences. As I said, ""Back to the Future"" is not the best movie ever made.

Otherwise, it gets a tad annoying. Marty's continual, idiotic 'slip-ups' with 1985 references in 1955 give me a headache and make me wonder if he's not mentally defective. Pepsi Free? Was that on earth either before or after a couple of months in 1985?That said, Crispin Glover should have gotten an Oscar for his performance as Marty's dad George. He takes the generic nerd written in the script, chops it into kindling, and uses it to set the screen on fire. With his incomparable gift for communicating character through body attitude, CHG transforms the one dimensional creature of the dialogue into an entirely mesmerizing cinematic force.

680,codfather-84460,Pure Genius,10,2 June 2018,"Duun, dun, dun, dun,dun,dun,dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dundadun. My condolences.Back to the Future released in 1985 is considered one of the best sci-fi movies of all time and I with out a doubt agree. The story follows a teenager who goes by the name of Marty McFly played by Michael J. Fox who has a strange friend named Emmet Brown played by Christopher Lloyd who invents a time machine using a Delorean which the instant that it appears on screen becomes one of the (if not) most famous vehicles in cinema which is the genius of Robert Zemeckis similar to the genius of Stanley Kubrick in The Shining with the ending of it which is ambiguous, yet awesome and Zemeckis seems to be the Kubrick of this film for sure.First off, we have the incredible cast and acting which is certainly applicable to Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd who I still retain as two of the best lead actors in all of cinema from their charismatic performances and astounding chemistry which still puts a smile on my face and is one of the most quotable movies ever made. ""Ronald Reagan? The actor? Ha! Then who's vice president? Jerry Lewis?"" That quote makes me laugh out loud every time and I love it as well as nearly everyone's performance. Crispen Glover as George McFly is the performance that put him on the map after the fourth Friday the 13th movie went totally under the rug even though I think that his performance was decent in it. Lea Thompson is also amazing and I don't care but I still laugh when Marty McFly finds her for the first time and is tempted to say that she's hot but then realises that she's his mother which makes me laugh every time I see it. Thomas F. Wilson is so funny as he plays Biff, the bully of Marty's father who is so funny due to his stupidity which is written so well and appeals to all ages which is the same for all the humour.Another thing that I appreciate is the clever cultural commentary as obviously not everything was the same in 1955 so there is going to be some references to how life was different then. First off, we have the continued comments on Marty's jacket with everyone saying that it is a life preserver which is really funny as nearly everyone acknowledges it. Another thing is the line said that says ""Who the hell is John F. Kennedy"" which is funny because obviously JFK wasn't even known at that time which is a nice little history lesson. One more thing is the racism as racism was still very prominent back then so the way that Marvin Berry's music group get racially attacked which is quite respectable on Zemeckis's half.The story is really clever as it centres around Marty accidentally traveling thirty years back in time and during his little tour around his home Hill Valley, he finds his father being picked on which you see earlier and the scenes are practically the same but thirty years back which adds to the excellent writing from the mind of Zemeckis. The way that Marty changes history when he moves his father out of the way to make it so that he is the one that gets hit by Lorraine's dad's car and meets and becomes the one that Lorraine falls for which is so clever that it sometimes becomes mind boggling. My favourite moment by far is in my opinion the best scene in any movie ever which is the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance where we see George McFly finally stand up to Biff when he punches him in the face which I love every time I see it, the Earth Angel scene where George kisses Lorraine for the first time which (I don't even care to admit) makes me well up with tears of joy every time I see it because it is honestly that beautiful, and the scene where Marty McFly does a cover of Johnny B. Goode by Chuck Berry rest in peace and that it is so funny when he starts rocking out to the point of everyone thinking he's a complete weirdo which makes me laugh every time.Overall, this movie is definitely one of my all time favourites with it's charm, really funny humour and it's just a total joy to watch and one youngsters can enjoy and appreciate and I am so glad to give my favourite movie of all time a ten out of ten.",Back to the Future

His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of useless machines. Their acting is awesome. I think this is not only because they are talented, but also because the director wrote a great screenplay, which showed how the acting should be in the film.

A 17 year old teenager called Marty Mcfly goes back in time to 1955 and has to find away to get back to his year 1987. The movie is great for all ages since its a action comedy has no swearing,and no physical violence.I don't recommend it for kids that are under 6 years old cause they might get a bit confused, but what is great is that for some older people they might connect with a few things that happens to Marty in 1955 that will seem weird to the new generation which is all normal back then, but anyway the movie still is great it has great acting and voice play with the main characters being Michael J.

690,GarethJThomas,"""Are you telling me you built a time machine.....out of a DeLorean?""",10,24 February 2004,"PLOT SPOILERS:Marty McFly is your average teenager, living in Hill Valley, CA, in October 1985. He likes rock music, has nerdy parents, has a beautiful girlfriend Jennifer - oh, and his best friend is eccentric scientist Dr Emmett L Brown. One night, Doc Brown calls Marty to the mall to record his latest experiment - a time machine built into a DeLorean sports car! Unfortunately, an encounter with some Lybian terrorists means Marty is accidentally sent back to November 5th 1955, where he interferes with his parents' first meeting. Marty finds the 1955 version of Doc Brown and they discover Marty's future mother Lorraine has a crush on him rather than on his future father, the wimpy George McFly! Local bully Biff Tannen is also causing trouble for Marty. Marty has just one week to get George and Lorraine together, defeat Biff and get himself back to the future using the bolt of lightning that will strike the clocktower at 10.04pm on November 12th 1955.OK, now the plot is out of the way, I shall review the film. This is one of the best films I have ever seen, if not the best. The actors play their characters well, the storyline is gripping and engaging, and the filmmakers have managed to create the 1950's successfully.The cast are perfect for their parts. Apart from Michael J Fox, the other main cast members all play their characters at 2 different ages, 30 years apart, and they all convincingly play the older versions of their characters. Special mention must go to Tom Wilson who is excellent as bully Biff Tannen, and of course Christopher Lloyd - no-one could play Doc Brown as well as Lloyd, with the waving of arms and the scientific speech - it is the part Lloyd was born to play. Although not technically a ""character"", the DeLorean time machine looks very scientific, yet also looks like it could fall apart any minute since it was built in Doc Brown's garage! I personally think it looks futuristic (and so do the Peabody family in 1955, when they see it they think it is a UFO!) and yet very stylish.The story is engaging and the filmmakers have a lot of ""set it up, play it off"" moments, which make you remember to earlier in the film. Example: Marty fails a guitar audition with his band in 1985, but manages to wow the crowds whilst playing ""Johnny B Goode"" in 1955. Although the idea of time paradox is not really examined at until the sequels, there are hints of it here for all the scientific people out there. :-) Various one-liners, in-jokes and jokes about the differences between 1955 and 1985 are scattered throughout the film.Alan Silvestri's score is one of the best he's done, and he manages to capture what the audience should be feeling at that time. The race to the clocktower near the end of the film has suspenseful, action music; whilst the scene where George and Lorraine get together has romantic, feel good music. The main theme is very catchy and you'll be humming it for quite a while! Various songs from the 1950's and 1980's are used, including ""The Power Of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News.Overall, a very good film that launched the movie career of Michael J Fox, and was one of the smash hits of 1985. It'll be a classic for all time. :-) 10/10.",Back to the Future

693,bigjc33,Great Scott!!! :),10,2 February 2012,"Back to the Future is one of the time travel movies that does things right. The story of the film is basically Marty Mcfly(played by Michael J.Fox) is living in 1985 and his friend Doc Brown(played by Christopher Lloyd) ,who is a mad scientist shows off his new invention: the time machine. Something crazy happens that causes Marty to go back to 1955 in Doc's time machine and is stuck in 1955, and to make matters worse, the time machine is broken! On top of that, he stupidly alters his future and prevents HIS OWN BIRTH! Crazy huh? But, its up to Marty and Doc(played by Christopher Lloyd) to not only get Marty back to his present time, but to also fix the wrongs he has caused to his future! I will not spoil this movie because you must go see this magnificent piece of film-making! The performances in this movie were all fantastic! Especially the best villain in that movie: Biff. He is a mean bully that picks on everyone and has the most hilarious lines in this movie!""Well look at what we have here."" Robert Zemeckis did a superb job in establishing the characters and the plot-line.Not to mention, its a blend of other genres besides time-travel. There is romance, high school, sci-fi and action all in one movie!WOW! Hoow did they manage to do that you may ask? Well, it just works because the script cleverly sets the movie up. Plus, the story runs very smoothly during transitions of scenes. Usually, when time travel is involved as a premise to a story, it would fall completely apart. But, thankfully they didn't do that! The story is actually not as complicated as people think. But, it does make your head spin of all the things going on in the movie! Its very consistent on switching to those scenes. Plus, the special effects were jaw-dropping back in the 80's but today it kind of looks outdated. However, this film has a charm that makes this film a spectacle in the time-travel genre. Now, what I liked about this film was the way the story was presented and the hilarious interactions between the characters:""Oh what are you looking at butt head?"" Oh and the special effects!

Back to the Future was, in my opinion, not only well written, but also well acted. This is definitely a classic for anyone who is a collector.Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly has befriended an eccentric scientist whom he calls, ""Doc."" The scientist is one zany actor, Christopher Lloyd. The two are a wonderful pair. If any of you remember, Michael was in Family Ties, and Christopher was in Taxi. Brilliant actors, and a brilliant unfolding script.What makes this movie so wonderful is that it isn't exactly predictable. You will be on the edge of your seats if you tend to get wrapped up in a move. I know I thought I had it solved in the first fifteen minutes as I usually do, but no! There are many details that would tend to escape the untrained eye for the two sequels to follow.If you are going to watch this movie, then be prepared for the next two. They are the filler for this.

Aside from that, this film satisfies an urge most of us have to know and experience what our parents were like when they were young and falling in love, and to understand what it was life to live in those times. The film's depiction of the contrasts between the world of the 1950s and the 1980s gives viewers food for thought about how our culture evolved, and what we've gained and lost in the process. Performances are universally credible, sometimes brilliant, and advance the plot nicely.

It's funny the first time, it's even funnier the second time, and the third time it's still very funny, but you notice the small details in the movie. Examples: In the first movie, when Marty goes to see the Time machine for the first time, he drives (on a skateboard) by a sign that says ""Twin pine mall"". When he escapes from Old Man Peabody in the car, he hits on of Peabody's Pines, (there where 2 of them) - and when we see the mall later on in the film (when he has come back to the future), the sign says ""Single Pine Mall"" Another is in third movie. At first the ravine is called ""Shonash Ravine"", and in the future (before Doc and Marty arrived) it's called Clayton Ravine, because Clara Clayton should have fallen in it. But because they save Clayton and Marty, who's known as Clint Eastwood back then, falls in it instead. Well of course he does not fall in, it's just the train, but Doc must have said to the people in Hill Valley, as an excuse. So they name the Ravine after Clint Eastwood (Marty), so it's called Eastwood Ravine. And there's a lot of these funny small things in the movies, and that's just a fraction of the reason why this film is one of the best ever made!",Back to the Future

This movie takes place in the past, present, and future. A 17 year old boy gets sent 30 years to the past.
I think that it was really interesting the differences that there were in the different time periods. In the 50's segregation was still going on. African Americans were the waiters and didn't have any rights. In the 80's segregation was over and there was more acceptance. There was even a African American elected as mayor.
The director is Robert Zemeckis and some main characters are Lea Thompson, Micheal J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispín Glover. I haven't seen them in any other movies but I've heard about them.
I really liked the movies lines and plot. They had really funny sayings and the actors weren't that bad. I would watch this movie in my own home and recommend it to some friends even. Overall it was a good movie with very funny dialogue. And a interesting plot.",Back to the Future

I do agree with the ones who handed the prize over Blade Runner after a good bundle of titles were cast out in quite a sensitive selection. However, while scrolling down on the honor list I did not find Back to the Future included (Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back were there nonetheless and in my very humble opinion both films are space-epic rather than genetically pure Sci-Fi).Back to the Future can be considered a typical yet serious Sci-Fi movie: all of the main aspects regarding time traveling, such as how the time machine's engine is put to work or how these kinds of trip generate time-space paradoxes, are present and clearly enough explained. This movie's progression was as well very carefully and dynamically put into sequence. Back to the Future is a classic for those who were teenagers (and the not so young ones of that time) when it was first released. Emmet Brown is arguably one of the most remarkable mad scientists ever created (by the way, mad scientists are another main topic in Sci-Fi) and I never tire of watching its re-runs over and over again, anytime.Well, perhaps it's just me, being not an important scientist but a picky moviegoer.

I love it now as much if not better than when I was young.Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd are great, Crispin Glover was superb (as usual) as well as Lea Thompson and Thomas Wilson. There are some great moments especially when George McFly tries to impress Lorraine at the restaurant, that was pretty hysterical as well as Biff and his friends chasing Marty and running into the manure truck. The cast and supporting cast were incredible, no other actors I don't think could've pulled it off so well. . You'll always remember Michael J. Fox as Marty, Christopher Lloyd as Doc and Crispin Glover as George Mcfly. I like the other 2 movies as well but I think the 2nd one would've been better if Glover took the role as George again.

I have to start by saying that the actors were absolutely amazing. They captured perfectly that revolutionary atmosphere of the 80's. I actually feel what is like to be a teenager in that period just by looking at the way they act. The script and the way it is made OMG i seriously don't know where to begin. All the jokes and punchlines are so carefully implemented, this movie has so many references to both real things like the joke with Ronald Reagan and things from the bttf universe, to give an example it would be the continuous repetitions that are always placed cleverly and even if you get a feeling of what is next you always end up satisfied. What this movie really tries to emphasize is that history repeats itself and that we create our own destiny. The amazing thing about this movie is how Marty travels back in time, a place where we believe we know everything about and we are somehow still mind-blown by every character and action and feeling .You just cannot not get that chill when u think of how irreversible time is and the way this movie captures all these emotions is simply extraordinary.

Director Robert Zemeckis has been known for sensational movies such as ""Cast Away,"" and ""Forrest Gump."" But ""Back to the Future,"" is by far my favorite of Zemeckis's movies. ""Back to the Future,"" is about a man named Dr.Emmitt Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. When Dr. Brown makes a time machine out of a 1981 DMC DeLorean, Marty accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past. When he meets his teenage mother, to Marty's disbelief, he notices that she is more interested in him other than his father. Marty now must plan out an event with his teenage father that he believes will unite them and his existence will then be saved. The overall feeling of this film is quite exhilarating, there is some action, some romance, and quite a bit of nostalgia that I think is essential in all great movies. Not to mention some memorable quotes such as ""Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that you made a time machine... out of a DeLorean?"" and ""Roads... where we're going, we don't need roads.""

716,bimpsonbimpson,Brilliant,8,22 January 2016,"Back to the Future is the classic sci-fi, adventure and comedy film nearly everyone has watched and loved, it is directed and co-written by Robert Zemeckis, staring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as a troubled teen and a failed scientist who a thrust into a adventure through time in this praised trilogy.I will try be as unbiased as possible but even if I were to forget the years of loving this film and forgetting about all the joy it brought me, it's still a fantastic film. Back to the Future achieves in every aspect which is more than can be said for a lot of films.First off are the characters, perhaps the most important reason why this film is so great, each character is distinct and unique, likable and interact perfectly leading to hilarious and emotional scenes. They are all fantastically performed by a superb cast who bring these people to life more than any other actor could, you can't imagine another person playing them because they just fit so well in their roles. When you boil down this recipe and sprinkle some well written dialogue on the top you get some brilliant scenes, most of which made me (and the whole cinema) howl with laughter. Not only that but the romance intertwined with the plot is very well done, not feeling forced or poorly executed, this is coming from a guy who hates unnecessary love in films, I liked the romance! Which was very important since it makes up a huge chunk of the plot.On top of a captivating story and a set of great characters are also great visuals from its cinematography to its slightly dated effects which just add to the charm. The use of visual comedy which is very scarce now days was a nice addition. All accompanied by a stunning score by the always brilliant Alan Silvestri which is one of my favourites to this day, from the roaring orchestra to Huey Lewis and the New this is a go to soundtrack for me and goes great with the film, adding to the humour and the tension which for what many would consider a laid back lazy Sunday film, there is a lot of.Overall this is one of my favourite films of all time and has been since I first saw it many years ago and the fact that it's still up there really says something about how timeless it is. The characters, the humour, the music, everything is just spot on all combining into something that will be loved for generations to come.",Back to the Future

726,PepeGranja,one of the best films ever!,10,4 November 2014,"Steven Spielberg is a genius for Produce Back To The Future, he strikes the perfect balance between superior quality and self- depreciation. Robert Zemeckis directs with brisk pacing, making every scene count and sharply defining the key characters. While the film never aims for more than two dimensions, Marty is eminently likable, and Lloyd makes Doc Brown, with his wild white hair and perpetually wide eyes, one of the more memorable mad scientists in movie history.Lea Thompson gets the least showy but most delicate role. The film handles the potentially precarious covetous relationship between the young Lorraine and her teen-aged son with a playfully steady hand, and steers it to an unexpected but in retrospect obvious resolution.The DeLorean leaving flaming tire marks as it launches into time travel is one of my favorite scenes and i love Elisabeth Shue :)",Back to the Future
727,isabelleholthaus-18311,"""Back to the Future"" - One of the most successful movies from the 80s",10,7 March 2021,"The first part of the ""Back to the Future trilogy"" was published in 1985. The director Robert Zemeckis and the actors, especially Michael J. Fox (Marty Mc Fly) and Christopher Lloyd (Doctor Emett Brown) as the main characters created a fantastic film with an exciting storyline. The filmography is to be assigned to the science-fiction and comedy sector with the mixture of action and a lot of jokes.
The crazy professor Emett Brown develops a time machine included a special invention - the ""Flux capacitor"". He installed the device in a Delorean, which runs because of the high energy demand with plutonium - a high energetic and radioactive element. When doctor Emett wants to present his new invention to Marty - a boy from the neighbourhood - he was shot down by lybian terrorists, from whom he had stolen the plutonium earlier. To escape the dangerous situation Marty must use the time machine. Before he could do anything Marty lands in the year 1955 where he must save the professor and not at least himself and his whole family.
In the first part and also in the two others of the ""Back to the future trilogy"" there is a classic fight between the good and the evil. Biff Tannen and his gang are the bullies in Hill Valley, the setting of the film, which looks older or more futuristic due to the change to different time zones. In the future Biffs son and in the past Biffs dad are the troublemakers Marty has to deal with.
In my opinion the movie is one of amazing film works I ever saw. The acting skills of the single characters are wonderful and very satisfying. In addition to that the film effects and the soundtrack is wonderful although the film was made 35 years ago. I like the vibe of the whole movie, which always has a surprise in store. if you want to see for yourself, you absolutely have to watch the film.

I had to write it for the sake of humanity and space-time continuum ;)Theme & Genre: The first thing which strikes me in BTTF is the theme, which is by far the most puzzled idea ever conceived by human mind - ""Time Travel"". Every true science fiction fan (or for anybody for that matter) have always wondered, if he could change the past. What if he could visit the past and see what was it like to meet your parents when they were your age? Its a truly wonderful idea, and with all its anomalies and paradoxes, still never fails to amaze the audience with the possibilities. In Particular, BTTF cant be put into just one Genre. Due to Time travel, its Sci-Fi, but its comedy, Romantic, as well as, a thriller, with many hair raising experience. The beauty of BTTF is the combination of all these genre with an awesome fusion, without overdoing anything.Story: The most important thing for a movie after the theme is its story. And it hasn't been compromised. BTTF part 1 has an exceptional story line, which only becomes more interesting in subsequent parts. Because of the time travel theme, you get to again witness a plot in part 2, that already had been happened in part1, which is why time travel is interesting, in the first place. (Even writing about it now, is giving me goosebumps.)Effects: Imagine at a time sans GUI OS (Like Windows), how can you imagine the creation of a 3D holographic shark coming out at you, or a flying hover board, or a flying De-Lorean in the midst of air traffic... I could go on, but you got the point..Music: Don't even get me start on this. But I want to :) The music is nothing short of epic. The grand nature of music, just compliment the grand nature of the plots. Romantic song, ""Power of Love"", a more superb romantic song ""Earth Angel"", the groovy ""Back In Time"".. and then the BTTF score by, the Outatime Orchestra, makes me feel like I am a part of something big, a part of the movie itself.Conclusion: Well, everyone have a different taste, but I am talking about the movie, who have a fan base of more than half a million on a Facebook page alone. (as of the time at writing this review). A movie which has been released on Blue Ray on its 25th Anniversary, along with re-release in select theaters, and a movie which has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry! A movie which is timeless, which never gets old, no matter how many times you see it, that is, you had to had a taste in Sci-Fi though.And to say, its just a movie which is ""25"" yrs old! For some, its more than a movie, its a genre in itself.",Back to the Future
737,starcollector73,The perfect movie package....,10,8 October 2003,"Back to the Future is one of my all time favourite movies. A perfect blend of adventure, time travel and comedy that has the added bonus of a sparkling cast and a great 1950's backdrop. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as the wide eyed, white haired Doc Brown and Crispin Glover delivers a memorable performance as Marty McFly's nerdish father. This film made Michael J Fox a movie star and watching his energetic and adorable performance its easy to see why. Fox gives Marty charm and he has the rare and under appreciated gift of making characters seem likeable, this role fits him like a glove. Pratically rushed out to buy the trilogy on DVD when it was released and i know its a film that i will never tire of watching. Great soundtrack, great cast, great script, great movie...makes you realise how cool the 80's actually were.",Back to the Future
738,TvIsForMe,Very cool and exciting,10,9 July 2013,"I'm a fan of all the Back to the Future movies. I love them because they are very cool and exciting, and they incorporate the styles of plots that I love most, comedy, action, adventure, and even a little romance.Anyone who watches this movie will not be disappointed, the actors are really awesome, and the plot idea is great. This movie is personally my favourite of the three. Marty (played by Michael J. Fox) is sent back in time to 1955 from a time machine created by scientist Doctor Brown,(played by Christopher Lloyd)where he interferes with the past, and has to make sure his teenage parents end up together.",Back to the Future

I had never seen a more enjoyable and witty movie in my life till then. About the time I was a teenager, thinking about what I would not do to go back in time and change things in the past!!! The 'time travel' trilogy is, I think the best that is, though not scientifically accurate. Robert Zemickis' shots of the DeLorean were amazing and well cut (though somebody reported seeing black gloves on some remote-controlled shots of the DeLorean! - frankly I could not make out the gloves. OK, maybe I am blind!). Michael J. Fox as the young ambitious Marty McFly and his 'Someday Jeniffer, Someday!' remain embedded in my mind. I think Fox plays the teenager to utmost perfection. I have never seen a teenager like that in my entire life!!! Doc Brown remains the most memorable scientists ever played in Hollywood! Christopher Loydd was impeccable, amazing!!! Kudos to Robert Zemickis for creating one of Hollywoods greatest characters in comedy! Amazing performances by Thomas Wilson (Biff Tannen) and Crispin Glover who plays the wimpy 'dad'. Doc's 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything!' has got to be one of Hollywood's most positive dialogs. This is one movie that will always be one my favorites.",Back to the Future

Then my Dad FORCED me to see it, and now it's his fault I enjoyed these movies from start to finish. I'm sure you're child will be overjoyed with these movies too. If your a kid or teenager, take it from a 9-year-old, you'll adore it. If you came here looking for a plot line, sorry! In my opinion, one little hint at the movie could destroy one of the surprises, making the goodness of the plot crumble before your very eyes!!! That was a little too dramatic, but who cares!

Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinema history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film an absolute perfection score:First and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film's highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50's nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film's core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson's 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay.Finally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot's main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80's and 50's at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced.The audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time. What is more exhilarating is the fact that then-president Ronald Reagan loved the film to the point that he used famous BTTF quotes, for example, during his 1986 State of Union Adress. What an achievement ladies and gentlemen!(90/100)",Back to the Future

Modern day (1985) teenager Marty McFly (Micheal J Fox) accidentally travels back in time to the year 1955, interrupts his parents first meeting and has to get them together without affecting the time-line.Back to the Future (1985) is a sci-fi, drama, comedy but above all, feel good movie that draws from almost every film genre, as a result there's something there to enjoy for everyone. Watching multiple times is preferred to pick up the subtle details (watch the name of the mall).This movie along with it's two sequels is one of the few films that you can watch over and over again and it never gets boring.

769,ja227,A generational epic disguised as a sci-fi comedy,10,31 March 2013,"In the movie Back to the Future, we follow Marty McFly, a typical American 1980s teen (performed by a 24 year-old Canadian...) who has big dreams. Much of his ambition is driven from his underachieving family, headed by an alcoholic mom and a nerdy beta male dad. His two older siblings aren't much better. He just can't seem to make sense of how he, a seemingly cool guy in a garage rock band, with a hot girlfriend, can be related to these losers. It is easy to see why he was drawn to a persistent dreamer, an inventor by the name of Doctor Emmett L. Brown. This relationship leads him on the adventure of a lifetime - not just his, but those of his ancestors and descendants.Over the course of the film, Marty finds out that his loser, hopeless parents, once had the same hope for the future and dreams that he had. He finds out that his dad got that way that he is by suppressing his dreams to become an author due to fear of rejection, much like Marty himself is afraid of taking his guitar talents all the way. He also finds that his seemingly traditional ""nun"" of a mom was actually quite the opposite in her earlier years. It turns out they aren't that much different from himself as he had imagined.This is a major theme of the film. It was very relevant in the era of the 80s, where so-called ""generation gap"" alienated teens from parents who came from an era before the cultural revolution of the 60s and 70s. Often many young people of that time thought what they saw in 50s reruns (also referenced in the film) was the way life was really life back in the 50s. This is natural. For whatever reason, younger generations paint a picture of previous generations. Some of this is their own imagination based on a lack of experience, and some is the idea that parents have of making sure their kids don't repeat the same mistakes that they did. Either way, it is an issue that kids of the ""Generation X"" or ""MTV Generation"" dealt with, and also covered in John Hughes movies like the Breakfast Club.Another theme is that of the wise sage and his protégé. This goes back to ancient times, Alexander and Aristotle, David and Samuel, Arthur and Merlin, and so on. This relationship is also used in the Star Wars movies, with Luke and Obi-Wan. Of course in the modern frame of reference, a wizard, philosopher or prophet becomes a mad scientist aloof to the world, and the young protégé is a high school kid who plays the guitar and rides a skateboard. The basic idea, however, is still the same. The old man, declining in years, passes on some wisdom to the next generation and helps the hero come of age.Back to the Future is, after all, a coming of age story. It is perhaps *the* coming of age story of the generation. While some come to the realization that their problems are not ""unique"" to their era through contemplation, Marty came to this realization based on first hand experience. Marty starts out somewhat immature and naive about the world. He thinks every parent started out as a parent (with maybe a few less gray hairs) and that for him it will be different. He starts to realize that the way people are in their adult life are the direct result of their choices as dumb teens, when they think that they know better. Back to the Future is a trilogy, of course, so Marty doesn't learn all of his lessons in the first movie, but he does learn a lot of them.Of course this is not all that the movie offers. There are perfectly-executed action sequences, the stories of Marty's parents getting a second chance at life, and one of the best villains in a teen movie - Biff Tannen. A lot can be said about the small town of Hill Valley, with its repeating generational problems. However, I don't think this message is as universal since most today live in different towns and neighborhoods than their parents did. Still it an amusing plot device to see how these small town families repeat the same patterns over the generations. Even the manure haulers are not left out of this generational gag.I call Back to the Future epic, because it is. It deals with a ""heavy"" issue - time, and plays with it in ways no other movie has before or since. The heroic scale of preserving one's own material existence seems to me to be worthy of being called epic. The isolated three-dimensional location of Hill valley is purposely small and obscure. It is not a sprawling land like Tolkien's Middle Earth or a vast space empire like Lucas' Galaxy far away. Its is very unlikely it has had many newcomers in its 100+ years of history. This isolated spot is not to give the movie a quaint feel, as small towns are used in other films, but to focus on the epic nature of time itself. The musical soundtrack of this film definitely adds to the epic feel of the movie. It is still a sci-fi comedy, however, and there are plenty of laughs to be had, and many technical wonders to behold. It's best not to label the movie and enjoy it for what it is. I think movies like this defy traditional labeling by genre.",Back to the Future

Marty dreams of making the big time with his band but is held back by the criticism of others, his fear of rejection, and the short comings of his family. But one day Doc Brown calls upon Marty to assist him in the testing of his newest invention, a DeLorean converted into a time machine. This movie is a fabulous adventure with good acting, special FX, and humor. The characters are very well written and very likable. This movie is brought to you by the first class director who is credited with Forrest Gump and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit. This is a true American classic movie that will be remember for many generations to come. If you haven't seen it, if you like good movies, buy it. Believe me it's worth it.",Back to the Future

772,phantomrider95,Impossible for anyone to not like!,10,9 August 2016,"Even 31 years after its initial release, Back to the Future has stood the test of time! There is absolutely no possible way ANYONE could hate this movie, and there are 3 reasons why!The first reason why Back to the Future is an impossible movie to hate is that its story is very original and doesn't seem to be hard for anyone to understand! A small-town California teen named Marty McFly is thrown back into the '50s when an experiment by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown goes awry. Traveling through time in a modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his parents, and must make sure that they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even more dauntingly, Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc Brown. One of the greatest aspects of the story is the idea of a teenager and a scientist traveling back in time in a DeLorean, which I have to imagine is the only instance of a movie making heavy use of a car as a way to travel through time. Another great aspect of the story is its message which argues that you can travel back in time to the years when your parents were teenagers, and straighten them out right at the moment when they needed help the most.The second reason why Back to the Future is an impossible movie to hate is the amount of memorable scenes and quotes that anyone who has seen the movie knows the most about! One of the most memorable scenes is when Doc tests out his time machine while Marty uses a video camera to record it. Doc tells Marty that if his calculations are correct, ""when this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***!"" The final reason why Back to the Future is impossible to hate is the amazing design that delves into the 1950's era with a flourish and takes you to the unknown future with creative flare. Robert Zemeckis sure did a great job at directing every single aspect of the movie, but he was more efficient in directing the visual style of the film was that allowed audiences to experience the culture and nostalgia of the 1950s in a humorous way!",Back to the Future
773,twisterchaser3,"fabulous, thrilling, suspense, and much more!",10,3 June 2005,"I love Back to the Future! Not only does it beat Star Wars, it also beats many more movies of its kind. Its so suspenseful, and yet, so touching and sweet. Its also hilarious to think that if you went back in time ur mother would fall in love with you! It presents a possible way of time travel. I love the Delorean, I want to get one. I love the scene at the clocktower in which Marty goes back to 1985. And I love the scene at the end where marty and the doc go back to the future, and doc says one his famous lines, ""where we're going we don't need roads!""

Had a wonderful crush on Marty, even Biff (but I won't admit it aloud), always though Lorraine was beautiful, but a little strange and thought her attraction to Marty was a typical plot twist, but oh so humorous. Part II was great too, not as good as the first, but the way it seemed so believable and the ideas they came up with, were superb.

And i believe the way the trilogy is structured is amazing. Robert Zemeckis closes out the first movie with a completed story and just begins the next one in a way. I think this is much better than what Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest, where too many stories are unfinished. The story line in Back to the Future is very thrilling.

From the opening pan of the clocks, to the spectacular (even today) flying Delorean shot, this film is extremely involving and exciting. The script (even though dated by it's 80's dialog) is fantastic.  That, along with  Zemeckis' incredible, flawless direction (his best to date) keeps the film moving at a smooth and satisfying pace.

The story is big and interesting, the movie is fast-paced (it speeds even through its more meaningful dialogues).There are some nice special effects, most of the action is original (in a movie, I suppose), and it has one of the most interesting adaptations of the idea of time travel. All the characters are depicted colorfully, without any useless or ""empty"" ones (for example - the Planet of the Apes' second astronaut, the one whose brain is modified, is only there to give the main hero [the first astronaut] another reason to dislike the Apes). Christopher Lloyd gives his best and characteristic performance here (although I haven't seen many movies where he stars or co-stars). Michael J.

There is a certain light-hearted, feel good quality in this movie that you just don't see anymore. It's of good moral fiber and the Directing has a crisp, sleek quality to it. The acting is perfectly attuned to the genre and the story is larger than life and the most original to come along in years.The dictionary defines the word ""Classic"" as ""something that outlives it's anticipated duration"".

815,gabzz103,What more could you ask for?,10,6 April 2006,"Wow, this movie had it all! It has an excellent comedic script, an extremely original science fiction and adventure plot, great suspense near the finale of the movie, very cool action sequences, a musical number and a romance subplot.In this classic comedy, Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a 17-year-old from Hill Valley, California. He is a friend with Dr. Emmet Brown or ""Doc"" (Christopher Lloyd), a mad scientist who invented a time-machine out of a DeLorean. When they are testing it out for the first time, Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955. He bumps into his teenage parents, before they are married, and by chance, his mother starts to like Marty and wants to go out with him. He then meets up with a younger Doc who helps him to try and make his parents fall in love with each other or else Marty won't be born and have him go back to 1985, the year he was originally from.The characters are excellent. I loved the character development and how Marty made everyone change for the better. It put a smile to my face seeing the impact that he had on everyone else. Marty and Doc have excellent chemistry and everyone in it had an excellent performance. I preferred Crispin Glover's performance as Marty's father, George McFly. His total nerdiness just made me crack up when he spoke.The script is also one of my all-time favourite screenplays. The humor is very clever and I loved the many one-liners. The plot is absolutely brilliant. It was truly one-of-a-kind and it made me think deeply of the concept of time travel and it kept me at the edge of my seat throughout the movie. I cannot find a single flaw in this great feel-good movie. They couldn't have made it better. Out of the hundreds of movies I've seen, this is the most fun I had watching a film.I rarely give out perfect scores but for Back to the Future, my rating is a 10/10, I could not recommend it more.

You don't need another long rambling review for a film seen and loved by millions. However, disagree with my awarding this best film ever made?You have to ask yourself one question; could it be improved in any way?Many great films could have been improved at the time if time and budget allowed. Some movies could work better with a different approach by the director, a more concise ending. A change to the score. Special effects, cinematography etc etc.But BTTF needs none of those. Ask yourself what could be done to this movie to enhance the enjoyment of the film. There is none. Everything is perfect, from the small details you only pick up on afterwards or by watching again (and again and again), a superb memorable score, the perfect leading man for this role and casting of other characters. There's no flab to the film. It gets from A to B (or maybe that should read B to A and back to B) without subplots and dead ends. It's written so well that in a different pair of director hands, would it be all that different?

817,terrymicheal12,I wanna go BACK in time to 1985!,9,27 March 2012,"""Back to the Future"" is one of THE best Summer adventure movies of all time.I have collected all three of the movies in this series. I have watched this movie hundreds of times, since I first saw it in the theatres and was blown away! What i hope for is better technology that DVD could offer. Maybe 3D?? My favorite part (and i'm sure also everyone else's) is when Marty played johnny b good (a real classic scene! Can't get that anywhere else!), and I love how the events changed by Marty brought good change to his family in the future. If you never watch any of the trilogy, make sure to pick up all three. Those who has, i suggest that you also bought all three since this is one adventure you will never be bored off, over and over again.",Back to the Future
818,ralph-sanchez,The best Summer adventure movie ever??,10,27 March 2012,"There are so many great movies to choose from, so I can't make that call but the original ""Back To The Future"" has to be ONE of my favorite films of all time.I have seen this many, many times and it just doesn't get boring. Michael J Fox became one of my favorite actors after this film and i followed his career into other films. The cast must've worked hard with several actors playing 2 parts and it finish's well to be open for the sequel. A superb plot which has a fantastic storyline and superb actors and it uses a classic Irish car in a Delorean. Robert Zemekis as director was fantastic and choosing Michael J Fox as the main lead was the best thing they could have done A fantastic film for all ages and i will be showing my kids this film when i have some. Even though it is 27 years old it still is one of the best films made in my opinion anyway.",Back to the Future

I remember seeing previews for this movie when it came out in theaters. The line that was shot from the trailer was when Lorraine said, ""Isn't he a dream boat"". Til this day, I can watch this movie over and over again and I can say the next line. That is how well I know this movie. I would love to write the novel for this movie. That would be very interesting. The other two were also gems. Have all of them. Michael J. Fox is a great actor and can play it so well. I recommend this movie to every family out there who has children. My son also loves the trilogy movie of Back to the Future.",Back to the Future

I know a lot of people who have seen this movie, and not one of them gave it bad feedback. Every one of them said it was great, or it was one of their favorites. I have seen this movie many many times, and I have noticed every little catch they have thrown in for fun. That is probably why this is my favorite movie.

What would you Do Different.,10,27 December 2005,"One of the best movies ever to graced earth in form of a TRILOGY.Most people wouldn't even stop to think about it. But this Movie Is full of Depth meanings, Richfull moments and serious things aside from the Wonderful Adventure, Special FX, Characters, acting skills it can certainly provide the viewer. We are looking at one simple damn good script from Bob gale and Zemeckis.We are getting one Fabulous Soundtrack From Master Alan Silvestri. And most of all we are lighted by the most wonderful characters, heartwarming and human there could be. Time travel Story About A kid who accidentally go back to the time their parents met. And attempting to go back to his own time, he discovers he can make things better...This is Back to the Future, An all time adventure, a classic, And a film that tries to show you that no matter how hard things in your life can turn out...

822,trapezus,This movie is disgusting,10,30 January 2005,"This movie is simply disgusting. I must have seen it about 50 times and each time I see it I get more and more disgusted. What is this thing? Each actor is playing perfectly, while you just have to look for one second at DcBrown's face to start laughing. The plot is so impressive that I can't get bored in a single scene, and the worst thing of all is suspense: It's chemically made(prepared with peaceful scenes to begin in action scenes) to make you feel real suspense, being unable to predict what is going to follow, and with a music casing that makes things about 6 times worse.In addition, it contains contradictory material: It's both classic AND innovation. How can you make an impressive, suspenseful action scene with a skateboard run without making something completely stupid? Ask those who wrote ""Back to the Future"". Besides that, the whole movie is completely according to reality, with just a small add-in: The time machine. And, finally, it's rated PG. A theme that would be expected to be rated-R for other scriptwriters, in this film it's made in a moral, family, let's say, way. Not a single bloody drop of bloody blood. All wickedness and sexual abnormality belongs to the bad guy. This must be the most disgustingly good film I have ever seen.",Back to the Future

824,sunny_jim9,Never a thing of the past.,10,25 January 2007,"I don't usually comment on movies but on this movie I'll make an exception. The story starts with teenager Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox), a dedicated guitar player with a wonderful girlfriend (Claudia Wells). He however has a rather unusual family with his father (Crispin Glover) being a wimp, mother (Lea Thompson) an alcoholic, and brother and sister perhaps the most weird of the lot. We also find out that Marty has a rather unusual friend, Docter Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who has been working on a time travel mechanism for the past 30 years. We are not shown Doc Brown until about 15 minutes into the film, however he is referred to as a 'real nut case who is very dangerous' by his Principle Mr Strickland who simply hates Marty's guts. We are soon shown how the device works by the Doc and Marty accidentally transports himself back to 1955 when a group of terrorists arrive to ruin both their days. Marty finds his parents are of the same age and destroys the way they are supposed to meet and suddenly it is an uphill battle from there, but with the help of the Doc who is 30 years younger, they come up with a plan that could help get Marty home (probably should've mentioned the time machine runs off plutonium).This film is a lot of fun having both humour and lots of twists and turns throughout the entire film. Superb acting by Fox who was actually 22 years old playing a 17 yrs old teenager, however most of us wouldn't notice. Terrific acting by Lloyd, Glover and Thompson who had very unusual roles. Zemeckis's directing is top quality, especially the beginning with the many clocks which *hints* this is a movie on time travel. A very family movie for people of all tastes that will always be a classic in my books. 4.5/5",Back to the Future
825,rhysaky98,Decade Defining Movie,9,22 September 2014,"Marty McFly, an aspiring musician and teenager living in Hill Valley California in the year 1985, takes a trip back to the 1950's using a Time Machine invented by his close friend Doc Brown. While there, he encounters his parents young selves, thus changing the futures events, Marty has to then insure that his parents fall in love to remove the damage he himself has caused to the past.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who is often associated with 1994's Forrest Gump which he won an Oscar for Best Director. Made his mark in Hollywood with 1985's comic science fiction Back to the Future, which became the most successful film of the year and received critical acclaim. However, it could all have been different. This is due to the fact that Robert Zemeckis was four weeks into shooting the movie itself, with a lead actor who did not make the final cut. Originally, Eric Stoltz was cast as Marty McFly. Michael J. Fox, then the star of TV sitcom Family Ties, was disallowed time off to work on a film as he was Zemeckis' first choice to take the Lead Role of Marty McFly. Meaning that Zemeckis looked elsewhere, specifically at Ralph Macchio and Eric Stoltz. Macchio declined the role, before Eric Stoltz took it on. However, Zemeckis decided that Stoltz had been miscast. Michael J. Fox was eventually cast and it proved to be a success. Michael J. Fox is now completely type-casted and identified as Marty McFly and no other. This shows that even though Robert Zemeckis did end up, going three million dollars over budget due to re shooting. His original idea of casting Michael J. Fox was the correct one. This is due to the fact that Fox found his portrayal to be very personal because within High School, he skateboarded, chased girls and played in bands. Very much like the character of Marty McFly. Michael J. Fox himself excels in this role, cementing his status in Hollywood, before going on to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2002. Now in the spotlight due to his battle with Parkinsons, in the 1980s Fox established himself as one of the most promising and charming actors in Hollywood. Other actors include Christopher Lloyd who previously collaborated with Zemeckis in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which is now regarded as one of the greatest films what combine both animation and live action, continues his formidable work in a role he is most recognised for, that of Doctor Emmett Brown, which he should of received more critical acclaim for than he did. In regard to this, the casting of every character involved is perfect and all performances are of the highest standard. Personally, Back to the Future is one of my favourite movies of all time. This is due to its inventive and compelling storytelling as well as the tremendous talent it shows from Actors, Actresses and those who were involved in both Editing and Special Effects. Back to the Future is like no other and in comparison to its sequels, it is a whole level above them. The Original Song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis and the News is superb as a whole and all though it does not reveal what the movie is about, the end credits song ""Back in Time"" does. I also love the use of Chuck Berry's ""Johnny. B Goode"" and how it is portrayed in the movie. It also think it is very creative, that Zemeckis shows that Berry himself got the idea of the song and his sound, from this very song as it was released in 1958, where the movie is set in 1955. Of course this is not the case, however I think it is a very inventive way to produce light comedy out of a scene. As well as Marty being named Calvin Klein for a good part of the movie.The only problem I have with the movie itself, is that there is one major plot hole. Surely, George and Lorraine would recognise their child as Calvin Klein or Marty in the years to come? Or does Lorraine think that it is coincidence that her crush and the main reason why herself and George are brought together, looks exactly like her son? Nevertheless, um sure Zemeckis knows the true answer and simply decided not to bother including it in the Script. After all, it is a movie.I would recommend all ages to watch Back to the Future, especially those who have an interest in Time Travel or just simply movies at all. If you dislike the movie itself, I find it hard to believe that like movies at all. This adventure, comedy, sci-fi is great for families, children and even adults. Even though the Special Effects may be a little dated, it doesn't suggest that you should not watch the movie as they are not the major selling point of the film itself. Other than that, I would recommend that you should watch Back to The Future and it should definitely be included on your bucket list and/or watch list.",Back to the Future
826,Anonymous_Review,a reflective classic.,10,30 June 2008,"Back to the future can only be described as a 1980's culture epic. This seems to be the first of the director and writer Robert Zemeckis' bright idea's which seem to come along once a decade, other film's he's noted for include the 2007 3D-Beowulf and Forest Gump.The whole film can be seen as nothing short of spectacular family fun. A great treat for any kid or adult looking to have a nice time. Beyond the wonderful mask the film wears though it has themes of bullying, class, incest, love, and justice. All the while containing a perfectly paced film that never lets you down. It may not be the worlds greatest film ever made, though that is up to opinion. But could be seen as a shining example of a good film. It's plot is relatively easy to understand, but it never treats the audience as stupid.The acting isn't bad, (despite my hatred for Michael J fox: See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqUo8RaJ23Q . This is how much I dislike Michael J. Fox) and the film shows brilliant parallels between scenes, all the while being an adventure with lovable characters, and an insight to a world far from our own. With great music from the 80's, including The power of love, by (see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-hUkO13Fy8)Huey Lewis and the news, memorable for other scenes in film history.Recommendations: Back to the future II & III, Works of Stephen Spielberg and Forest Gump.

If that is the case, you need this movie in your life.I first watched this movie when I was about 8 years old, and have loved the trilogy ever since. But this, the first of the 3, is arguably the best.I would say it's suitable for the entire family, but be warned, there is one or 2 minor profanities if you are watching it on DVD/Bluray, but if you are watching it on TV, these will have been neatly removed from the movie for you ;-) It's got an awesome soundtrack, it's funny, it holds your attention and has awesome gadgets and props, the big one being the time travelling Delorean, and a timeless fun story line.Marty (Michael J Fox) goes back in time and has to find a younger Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in the past to help him get Back to the Future before he potentially changes things in his present (1985).This movie has lived on to be a timeless classic and remains one of my favourite movies of all time.Trust me, you won't be disappointed and will be itching to watch the next 2 instalments as soon as your done with this one.",Back to the Future
828,sammyb-24065,Back to the future,8,2 December 2015,"SPOILER ALERT: Plot LeakThe film, Back to the Future, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a comical science fiction film on time travel. The film was released in 1985 starring Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teenager who enjoys working with a scientist and inventor named Dr. Emmett Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. The action starts when Marty is sent back in time to 1955 in a DeLorean time-machine. This rash action not only threatens his parent's relationship, but his very existence. This is a humorous family film great for all ages displaying a balance of humor, fantasy, family values, adventure, and clever entertainment. Not only is the film funny, but shows an in-depth plot with plausible plot-driving events and developed story lines. Although the special effects may lack the luster of modern day editing, it adds character to the film and creates a unique style since the special effects are used sparingly rather than constantly bombarding the audience with explosions. The characters are realistic, or in some ways stereotypical, but offer a kindness that is desirable in every-day personal interaction, encouraging the audience to bond with the time traveler and ""mad"" scientist on a journey shadowed by none. The film is different than most popular science fiction competitors of its time, showing that a well- developed narrative is just as desirable as thrilling special effects.",Back to the Future

The problem is that the mom and the dad are not getting married. They are actors.The special effects are awesome. I recommend it for 6 or more years old. There are 3 parts 1st Marty goes to the past second they both go to the future. On the third part they go to the past. My favorite part was when Marty uses photo to see how much time they have together as a family.the good thing is it is easy to make predichens about the next part.

I don't really like sci-fi films but this appeals to people on so many levels and genres that things like that don't really matter. Christopher Lloyd plays Doc Brown to absolute perfection when he swans around as if conducting an orchestra. Michael J Fox is the star of the movie but the supporting roles are cast so well that all of the characters are stars in their own right. I particularly like Thomas F Wilson as Biff and the way that he gets more manic and vicious as the trilogy unfolds. The combination of excellent special effects, brilliant directing and the true skill of the actors means that this is one of the few mainstream cult classics. It's a film for the whole family without being patronising or babyish. Ace!",Back to the Future

Doc Brown builds a time machine made out of a Delorean and Marty is sent back to the year 1955. Whilst in the 50s, he meets his parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) and accidentally ruins their chances of getting together.

All the other actors played their parts very well. I wish they would of continued the story of Marty and Jennifer. We do not know what happened to them.

I like other films from the 80s, like Lethal Weapon, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Return of the Jedi, but by far, Back to the Future is superior.

The fantasy of time travel gets everyone's attention. BtF allows us to believe it and enjoy it at the same time. The cast is magical together to say the least. Another reason BTF keeps drawing attention is because you get to compare the technology that in 1985 was considered futuristic with current technology while looking back at 1950's tech. BtF is truly a masterpiece.,Back to the Future

A feel good film, a film that made me want to go out and buy a skateboard and learn how to play the guitar, emulating the crazed performance of Marty McFly at the Enchanement Under The Sea Dance!I have watched this film well over 100 times and each time I watch it I get those old memories flooding back to me.  The story itself is essentially something that everyone would want to do - go back in time and change their present.  This film links the impossible to reality and makes your dreams come true, if only for a couple of hours.You can relate to each character in the film at some point and you really do believe that these events, no matter how bizzare, have actually happened.If you haven't watched it then you are either too young or you have been living the past 17 years in a cave!

Dr Emmett Brown's time machine has flung Marty 30 years back in time and he's stranded there unless the 1955 Doc Brown can help him. Worse: Marty's own mother, here a high school teenager, is falling for him instead of his father.It sounds like a clichéd science fiction movie that could only appeal to fans of the genre - but that couldn't be more wrong. A huge hit, it appealed across the board for its invention, its exuberant energy, and the famous finale - so tense, so very exciting and yet able to make you gasp and laugh at the same time.Looking back at it now, it seems less subtle than it did on release and you can't help but recognise how carefully the story sets out to manipulate you. Every scene, every line works but then later you see how you were set up: nobody says anything that doesn't become important to the plot later. That should be terrible, but it's done so very well that it's a treat. It's undeniably formulaic but so outstandingly executed that it vindicates the formula.No surprise then that there were two sequels (and subsequent video releases of the film had the line ""To Be Continued"" added to the closing moments).

What a delight! Sure, there are plot holes, but the sheer awesomeness of almost every scene, the ""well, the flux capacitor is fluxing"" attitude, the not taking itself too seriously make this movie great. The facial expressions and emotions of the actors are wonderful in every scene and the dialogue is amusing. The science of the movie is completely bogus but is not very relevant to the plot and is very believable. I am a big fan of ""Contact"", also by Zemeckis, and was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is also one of his films, and you can tell by the wonderful soundtrack.Well done!",Back to the Future
876,kuytd,Still my favourite film ever!,10,7 May 2009,"I first caught Back To The Future when i was very young, one Christmas at home. I was only born in 81, so i was hooked from early childhood.I have to say that i never have got bored of this film, no matter how many old VHS tapes i wore out through watching. With the sound off i could tell you every word, and hum along to every tune.The combination of Lloyd and Michael J Fox is inspired, with the youthful cheek of Marty and the crazy flare of the Doc. Every scene is full of rich acting, maybe not the heavy Oscar winning performances, but i think better, in that it just feels real. I will never get tired of how Fox can act so naturally.Another element for me is the iconic Delorean, being a car fan i think its a great choice, and at about 5 years old it just looks amazing! I have read one of the early release scripts from about 84, where the Delorean was going to be an RV, and the Doc was a womaniser. I'm very glad it did not come out that way.It is also one of just a few films unspoiled by its sequels, even if II did loose a little in story depth, III helps to just bring them all together.Just thinking about it now, I think i'll have to break out the DVD box set.",Back to the Future

It made me laugh and sustained the laughter throughout the film. Further, it made me watch the other two sequels, consecutively, and i completely enjoyed all the three parts!The storyline is bizarre and different, and it gives enough room for the humor quotient to fill in. Writers Bob Gale and Robert Zemicks, have made sure that the film goes on at a brisk pace. The entire film makes u laugh, and enjoy thoroughly. Speaking about the performances, Michael J. Fox, fits into the character of Marty like a 't'. His perplexed expressions are quite funny to watch, and tickles u. His confused looks, especially in the scene where his mother (in 1955), is about to fall in love for him, and the way he tries to dodge and escape her, deserve special mention. Christopher Lloyd is the man to watch out for; it is his body-language and performance which contribute to the humor factor mostly. His dialog-delivery, body- language, looks and expressions are sure to make you laugh!The Background score by Alen Silvestri, is pretty apt, and especially in the climax scene, his background score maintains the pace of the film and keeps you engaging. In a nut-shell, if you seek for complete enjoyment, and want to ache your own stomach, laughing, then Back to the future, is the one to go for!!!",Back to the Future

It has something for everyone - romance, action, comedy, adventure, drama, suspense. It does not lag! Science fiction is not my first pick for a movie, unless it's REALLY GOOD SCIENCE FICTION, like the Star Trek movies or any of the THREE Back To The Future movies. In this movie, our hero (Michael J. Foxx) gets to see how some foolish decisions work against him and ruin his future. Luckily, he gets the chance to change those decisions. He also gets to see how following one's dreams can make for a beautiful future. Strongly recommend. See the trilogy!",Back to the Future
879,dylfox,best movie ever,10,30 April 2010,this movie is my all time favorite movie. 2 and 3 are great movies also. Michale J.

Marty then mistakenly goes back in time to 1955. he meets his father and mother. his mom falls in love with him instead of his father. now he has to get them to fall in love or else he won't exist. and he still needs to get back to his time. the theme song is fantastic. everything about this movie is fantastic. none of my friends saw it. so if you've been looking for a good sc-fi action comedy look no further. that's about all i have to say.,Back to the Future
880,Suntop-Kinseeker,A bit of Fun and Start of a trilogy,9,15 August 2015,"This is a fun movie with a bit of wacky science behind it. Time travel is not possible and so far may never be possible because if it was why hasn't anyone come back to fix this world? :) Nevertheless, this movie follows Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and D. Emmet Brown along with Biff Tannen and others as they go back and forth from 1955 to 1985. In an effort to change his family for the better Marty goes back to 1955 to get his DAD and MOM together. Now Biff is also in love with Lorane (Martys Mom) and does everything he can as a Neanderthal bully to win her heart. Forcing her to be his girlfriend but turns him down every time.When Marty goes back to 1955 he alters the events in a way that would destroy his family completely mostly by accident. Pushes his dad out of the way of his grandpa's car. This makes it where Lorane falls in love with Marty who she think is named Calvin Klein (Brand of underwear he was wearing at the time) and this threatens his very existence. At the dance at school he plays Johnny B. Goode that apparently inspires the original guitar player (whose hand got hurt using a screwdriver to open the trunk where Martys dad was thrown in by Biffs cohorts) to call his cousin to have him listen to Marty play that song. It was a bit much for the 1995 people as the looked at him funny at the end of his solo. Where Marty then says a statement that everyones kids will love it.After everything in the dance is done and over with, Martys Mom and Dad kisses shortly after that which saves the family however if you look at the picture there are minor differences like his sister is not fat and his brother looks different.He returns to 1985 where Biff runs an auto detailer company, and Marty's dad writes a book about his encounter with Marty in 1955 thinking he was an alien being that brought his mom and dad together His brother wears a suit and his sister is skinny, plus Martys mom went from not liking Martys girlfriend to liking her. And at the end Emmet comes back and says, ""Marty you need to come back with me."" And Marty asks where, where Emmet says, ""Back to the Future"" which is the lead in to BTTF II.With all the zany antics done in the 50s and Dr. Brown coming back from 2015 *where are our hover boards and Mr Fusion?* this kicked of a wonderful Trilogy that is still liked today. There are rumors of a remake but how will that work now that it is 2015.",Back to the Future
881,Mike_Scurfield,A classic - the best adventure movie of all time.,10,7 May 2003,"This movie will always be special for me as it's the first movie I ever saw, and it's still one of my favourites.For those who haven't seen it, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a regular kid living in Hill Valley, he skateboards, he's late to school, and he's embarrassed by his parents.  He is friends with 'crazy' scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (wonderfully played by Christopher Lloyd), whose new invention turns Martys' life upside down.Marty accidentally sends himself back to 1955, where he manages to stop his own parents from meeting each other.  With no power for the DeLorean time machine, and no where else to go, he hooks up with (a slightly younger) Doc to get his parents back together before the inevitable happens... he isn't born!This movie is great in that it links a good story with even better characters. Full of funny moments, and quotable lines, this movie also sets up some great running gags which continue in the sequels (Marty waking up in bed thinking it was all a dream, the 'borrowing' of a skateboard, Biff & manure). Plus I think that this film has the best 'race against time' ending I've ever seen. (Doubled by not only getting his parents back together before he disappears, but also not missing his one single chance to get back to 1985).If you haven't seen it yet then you really should, I can't recommend it enough.  It's a great family film which can be enjoyed by anyone.  If it's been a while since you saw it, go back and watch it again, you'll be amazed at how many great bits you'll have forgotten about. A very exciting movie, a true adventure in every sense of the word, which is held together by a sound moral core: 'If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything'.

883,bydintoff,Spaceman from Pluto,9,15 October 2021,"Upon hearing Biff shout *Mc Fly!*, Marty turns around and the young stranger at the counter turns around simultaneously. Fascinating moment - encountering your parent as a stranger, your parent as a young non-parent.And then Biff humiliates young George in the same way as Marty had seen him humiliate middle-aged George. Touching, though odd and backwards. If you live long enough you might catch sight of yourself being the same bore or scold with your children as your parents were with you; or re-enacting some middle-school resentment or self-limitation that you think you should have grown out of. That scene at the counter is like the admonition that if you go on behaving like you do now, you'll always be a loser. Except the tape is running backwards. Depressing yes, surprising no. Nothing changes. There is no self-improvement.The movie half-heartedly tries to persuade us that the limitations of the father have been passed on to the son. You're both slackers, says the school principal not very insightfully. In order to have something in common with his father, the plot gives Marty a localized Self-Esteem Issue, whereby he's not 100% sure about his rock star potential, but is willing to be persuaded by his hot girlfriend who believes in him.Otherwise he's resourceful and brave and witty, not at all like the rest of his family. Maybe you were adopted, suggests Doc. Indeed. Or maybe George's automobile isn't the only thing that Biff has been free and easy with over the years. Or maybe Marty *is* a spaceman from Pluto, with Dale-Carnegian or Randian exhortations for George to stop being so passive and wimpy. But father's son or not, once he knocks George off the passive timeline, from then on it's existence or nothingness.Was the passive timeline worth living? The family founded on lies and weakness. George's shameful sneaky voyeurism kept a secret, but a price paid in self-respect. The Florence Nightingale effect bypassing the high school romantic hierarchy, but a price paid in 30 years of pity sex and disappointing children (I knew then, says middle-aged Lorraine, that this was the man I was going to spend the rest of my life with - brutal).Is the active timeline any better? Certainly, although the self-realized George doesn't come across as all that likeable. He's a big man in the small town, with Biff as a toady instead of a bully. His children have nicer cars and yuppie aspirations. Pinching his wife's ass in front of the kids might be a bit too much of an exhibition, but hey, they're a sexually fulfilled couple who don't have repressions or complexes, they're not like the prigs on the passive timeline.The key ten minutes at the heart of the film. The breakdown of Marty's plan to reestablish the family on another deception. George choosing for once not to walk away. George staring in wonderment at his Biff-slaying hand, light and free, his timidity and self-limitation left behind in his former life. He's turned from Clark Kent into Superman. Lorraine is sexually aroused by the violence enacted on her behalf. Is that enough to put the McFly patriarchy on a solid foundation? The photo says not yet - George is in danger of falling back into his cowardly habits (dark music), so he needs to slay one more bully (music brightens up), and then seize the moment to masterfully kiss the girl (back to the gorgeous strings of Earth Angel, photo says the future is bright).And then everything is kind of ok and the film is kind of over. But then there's Johnny B. Goode, a celebration that history *has* been rewritten, and an indulgence for Marty to convince himself that he *is* a rock star.",Back to the Future
884,chloe_rules123,Wonderful!,9,10 October 2012,"""Back to the Future"" is one of my all-time favorite films. It is one that the whole family can sit down and watch, but isn't one of those stupid childish animations that comes under ""family"" but is actually just for kids 2-8. It is one of the few films I never get tired of watching, and by now I must have seen it at least 50 times (no joke!). I've never gotten tired of this film as it is so original in the way it is presented. I've never seen another film where a DeLorean is a time machine, or one where a son is hit on by his mother for that matter... Anyway, this film is timeless, as it is so funny, clever, and you never know what is coming round the corner. The film is based in 1955, although it does start off in 1985. Marty McFly, one of the main characters, travels back in time and runs into his parents (George and Loraine), which starts off the whole story, involving a time machine, some messing with history, and pretty awesome music.

886,werdreuab317,Words can not Describe.,10,1 December 2011,"As this is my first written review, I figured it would be a good idea to review something that is close to my heart. Nothing is more important to me than films, and no film is more important to me than back to the future. So you could easily say its one of the most important things in my life. Its that awesome. I plan to make a video review of it sometime, but I am new at that and don't want to make it any less than perfect.I will never forget the first time I saw BTTF. It all started when my parents had their fancy dinner parties with their friends. As a kid those things a freaking torturous, so I usually spun out of there unless I was forced to stay. However I always enjoyed hearing about the movies that they remembered from ""the good old days"". One film they often talked about is Back to the Future and how much they thought I would enjoy it. So that intrigued me a lot. One day my mom bought the complete trilogy on DVD. I couldn't believe it, my mother had never boughten a film because she thinks its a waste of space. So I was in awe and I couldn't wait to watch it that night.I don't remember all of the details of me watching it, I do remember looking at the clock 15 minutes later and saying "" what the heck, its been 2 hours""! For me it totally surpassed the hype and gave me the most entertaining experience of my life. I have a vivid memory of my mom telling me to calm down because I was quoting the movie up the butt. So now that I've built it up so much, why exactly do I like this film so damn much?Im a junior filmmaker and often hear people say that the story is the most important thing in a film. There is no need to describe this story because if you don't know it, your probably living under rock. Suffice to say this film has such a great idea that is so easy to work with the lines practically write themselves. The whole idea of seeing your parents at your age is so universally funny that everybody can get the jokes. I seriously think this is one of the tightest screenplays ever. Everything is so tightly connected that I notice something new every time.The character world is full of clichés. However this whole cast brings something amazing to each of their performances. However I always have to go back to Doc and Marty as 2 of the best characters ever. Marty has like the perfect wisecracking attitude and an all around lovable personality, and the Doc just spits out comedy gold throughout the entire film. Also nobody could ever forget Biff Tannen. You just love to hate him, you also love to love him. I mean, my god, they made some of best characters is history.I usually don't get in to comedy movies because I often don't get in the movie, which makes it not funny. This movie had me laughing my butt(head) off. ITs just plain and simply and awesome and funny as heck script. Also who could forget all the classic lines in here. I honestly could quote lines from this for hours. It just plain old cracks me up.I need to wrap this up because there is nothing I can say that will show the greatness of this film. I can say with pride that its my all-time favorite film. It may be cheesy, but I will cherish it forever. This a comedy, a romance, an action movie, and a high school movie all in one, whats not to love. So how bought you make like a tree and get out of here, and check out Back to the Future!",Back to the Future
887,alanresul,Back To The Future (1985),9,25 September 2014,"Back To The Future (1985) The comedy, action and sci-fi classic that is, Back to the Future (1985, starring Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Is about a young high school student, named Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), living in Hill Valley, who is friends with the, genius with a little bit of crazy, scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who to travels back from the year 1985, to November 5th 1955, in a time travelling DeLorean. He gets stuck in 1955 and runs into his future parents when they were in high school, the only way for Marty to find a way back to 1985 is with the help of his friend Dr. Brown. First thing that came to my mind after I had watched the movie was the fact that the whole McFly family's lives got better after the crazy adventure Marty had been through in 1955. In the beginning you see how Biff (Wilson), basically bullies and dominates over, Marty's father, George (Glover). Then when Marty goes back to the future he tries to encourage his father to stand up for himself and ask Marty's mother, Lorraine (Thompson), out, even though she's in love with Marty. In the end Marty and George make a plan to make her fall in love with George instead of Marty. The plan is that Marty parks with Lorraine, he argues with her, then George comes and ""fights"" Marty to show that he can stand up for himself. Then it ends up by Biff being in the car grabbing Lorraine and trying to seduce her, while Marty is carried away, then George goes to the car opens up the door, and gets two options, either he really stands up for himself and saves Lorraine from Biff, or he just walks away like nothing happened. George chooses to stand up for Lorraine, and punches Biff in the face and he goes right down on the ground. This broke the whole pattern that had lead George to get held back by bad self-confidence and spent time doing Biff's homework for him and being bullied by him. So not only does personal life and his children's lives get improved, by them getting better jobs, but also his career takes off and he publishes a book on science fiction stories that he's been writing since high school.Second thing that came to my mind is that the story of how Lorraine and George fell in love changes, after Marty's trip to the 50s. At first the story is that, Lorraine's father hits George with the car, then George gets brought into the house and Lorraine falls in love with him, then they go together to the ""Enchantment Under the Sea Dance"" where they first kiss. When Marty goes to 1955, he sees his father almost get hit by the car, but then he pushes his father out of the way and gets hit by the car himself and gets brought into Lorraine's house. Then Lorraine falls in love with Marty, which will change the whole story of how Lorraine and George will fall in love. As earlier mentioned, George won Lorraine over by standing up for her and himself, against Biff. Hence their love story goes from her just pitying him, to her actually feeling safe with him and loving him for a better reason. The story doesn't only sound better if they tell it to people, but it has also had a great effect on how their future together looks. In the beginning you see Lorraine, drinking, looking pretty unhealthy etc. you also get to see how George is not paying so much attention to her or showing any form of affection for her or even communicating well with her. Then after, you see how much healthier Lorraine is, and also how much George shows his affection for her, by i.e. walking with her and having his arm over her shoulder constantly, and teases her like they're still teenagers. Overall the transition of the McFly family's lives is what struck me the most in this adventurous and exciting movie. The transition of how the family went from unconsciously unhappy to a great successful family, not only career wise due to their father having an improvement in confidence, but also relationship wise, especially the parents.",Back to the Future

There were so many things that happened in one part of the movie that became important later on in the movie that, if you weren't paying attention, was probably lost on some people, I felt it was brilliant!

It feeds the curious and demanding brain with complex twists and turns, and characters overlaying each other in a vast time continuum.These films are clever, sinuous; they are peppered with flashbacks and parallelisms, thus keeping you entertained throughout. Expect great one-liners (""Where we're going, we don't need... roads"").It's undoubtedly the trilogy with the most re-watchability in existence, excepting, perhaps, the original Star Wars tri.BTTF contains all the key ingredients you want in a great film, from great characters to great storyline and brilliant music to accompany and set the tone each scene.

The storyline is, of course, a favourite to many, and I just loved it. The idea of time travel and the 'butterfly effect' is portrayed extremely well throughout the film, and Marty's difficulties sticking to the rules of time travel (not helped by certain characters he encounters) never fails to entertain me. The links between the people he meets in 1955 and the people in his life in 1985 are shown so well, and the comedy about the differences in technology always makes me laugh. The film was great, and I thoroughly enjoyed it when I was younger, as well as later on in my life.",Back to the Future

Keaton in 'Family Ties' to Scott Howard in 'Teen Wolf', he caught the eye of many-a-girls; including mine...still!

Time traveling has always been exciting and fun. I've watched this and About Time which are movies about time traveling and both are awesome. BTTF is TOO Awesome. Couldn't believe this was a 1980s movie.BTTF trilogy is an incredibly awesome adventure taken by Marty McFly and Dr.Emmett Brown. Dr.Emmett Brown a crazy, funny scientist invents the time machine, the biggest dream of his life. And Marty who is his friend gets to be a part of this awesome adventure by mistake. The best thing about this movie is how it shows whatever happens is bound to happen whether you want or not. And how with change in your attitude or with some help you can completely change your whole life. ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Dr. Emmett Brown Back to the Future is an amazing movie. This 1985 movie is so much better in quality as compared to the movies nowadays which have a shallow impact on the audience. You will actually feel connected to the movie and glued to your seats till the end There are not many movies of 8.5-like rating which are packed with Comedy, Drama, Adventure of such level...

896,hseldon10,The Grandfather paradox goes boink!,10,29 March 2005,"This movie is a marvelous exploitation of the grandfather paradox. This paradox is a supposed impediment for time travel: If a young man goes back in time and makes his grandmother fall in love, then, his grandfather cannot marry her, therefore, his father is never born and he is never born and can never go back in time to make his grandmother fall in love with him. (A paradox, in this sense, is, as said by Marty McFly in Back to the Future II, one of those things that can destroy the universe).So, Zemeckis, with his amazing attention to detail, combines the talents of Christopher Lloyd and Micheal J. Fox to create one of the best science fiction movies of all time! It is a great comedy that attempts to laugh at how quickly does the past vanishes in front of the present, but also, how firmly does it remain (as firm as a Lone Pine Tree). Action packed, scientifically hilarious, Back to the Future is a movie that is icon of the 1980s.",Back to the Future

905,matthewceratops,A masterpiece at any time,10,20 March 2017,"Quite possibly, and quite probably, my favourite film of all time is ""Back to the Future"", released on 3 July 1985, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. The film stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and Crispin Glover, and features a score composed by Alan Silvestri. ​Writing is an essential part of filmmaking, and the script in ""Back to the Future"" is nearly a perfect one. Of course, in a time travel film, the appearance of inconsistencies, paradoxes, and other similar errors are almost inevitable. But, on first viewing ""Back to the Future"", and even for subsequent viewings, these plot holes aren't very noticeable due to the engaging story. The film explains the science of its time travel perfectly, with lengthy but fast- paced exposition. ​Marty, played by Michael J. Fox, is a likable and relatable protagonist. At the time of filming, Fox was busy working on the NBC sitcom ""Family Ties"", and so director Robert Zemeckis and producer Bob Gale hired young actor Eric Stoltz to fill in the part. A few weeks into filming, Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg decided that Stoltz just wasn't the actor they needed. Pushing back the film's release date and adding $3 million to its budget, they recast Fox as Marty under the condition that Fox would work on ""Family Ties"" during the day and ""Back to the Future"" at night. Fox often slept on the way to the film's shooting locations.Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, is both interesting and funny to watch. His long explanations of his work, along with his misunderstandings of what the future is like, make for plenty of amusing and intriguing dialogue. George McFly, played by Crispin Glover, is likable in his awkwardness and inflections. ​The film's antagonist, Biff Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson is a fantastically well-acted character that a viewer loves to hate. His arrogant nature and loudmouth remarks easily allow the audience to want to see him defeated by the end of the movie. The beautiful Lorraine Baines-McFly, played by Lea Thompson, also offers a great performance, both as her teenage and middle-aged selves, adding more comedy to the table. ​The music for the film is also spectacular. The score to ""Back to the Future"" was composed by Alan Silvestri. Silvestri's compositions for the film are orchestrated expertly, and the main theme carries a sense of adventure and awe. The songs ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News, created specifically for this film, fit well and are great to listen to on their own. The tracks covered by the fictional band Marvin Berry and the Starlighters are excellent renditions of the real-life oldies. ""Earth Angel (Will You Be Mine)"", originally by the Penguins, earned actor Harry Waters, Jr. a gold record certification, and rightly so. Chuck Berry's famous rock and roll tune ""Johnny B. Goode"" (performed in the film by Marty McFly, but dubbed over by Mark Campbell) adds a great musical scene and leads to a terrific comedic moment. ​The visual effects work in the film is always a treat. Three DeLorean cars were purchased to be modified for the film. The DeLorean time machine was designed by Ron Cobb, Andrew Probert, and Michael Scheffe, while effects supervisor Kevin Pike helped build the time machines. The flying DeLorean at the end of the film was created by the wonderful people at Industrial Light & Magic.The DeLorean is an aesthetically cool-looking car, and a far better choice than what was originally intended. When envisioning the film, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale had a time machine made from a fridge in mind. They decided to pass on the idea, since it could lead to inspired children getting stuck in refrigerators. The film's title was even a stroke of genius that had some concept issues. Sid Sheinberg, head of Universal Pictures, made some helpful alterations to the script, but insisted that the film be called Spaceman from Pluto. Subsequently, Steven Spielberg sent him a memo that implied that the crew thought it was a joke, and Sheinberg decided sheepishly to drop the idea.The set of Hill Valley was shot at the Courthouse Square backlot of Universal Studios. It was used in numerous films aside from ""Back to the Future"", including ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) and ""Gremlins"" (1984). The scenes in the film that took place during 1955 were shot first in the beautified backlot. For the scenes in 1985, the crew simply trashed and uglified the square, like leaving garbage on the streets and replacing classic motion pictures on a movie theatre sign with sleazy titles. Industrial Light & Magic animation supervisor Wes Takahashi created the lightning effects for the climactic clock tower scene by hand, which is an impressive and awesome-looking achievement. ​In finality, ""Back to the Future"" is a contemporary classic. Its acting, direction, music, visual effects, editing, sound mixing, and most importantly, screen writing, all lend to it being an engaging, story-and-character driven film. It has marvelous foreshadowing, superb character development, and a well-structured story without any unnecessary scene; whatever few problems it could have are insignificant, and there may be no film I enjoy more.",Back to the Future

Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""? Think about it. Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with TV's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney). There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish. High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis. Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean. Oscar- nominated song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film. Classic.Also Dean Cundey as DP was fantastic!

910,donalscameron,Timeless 1980's classic,9,14 July 2017,"Back To The Future is a perfect example of a film that gets better the more I watch it. With time travel, great characters and fantastic comedy it is no wonder it is considered a classic. Michael J. Fox plays fish out of water Marty Mc Fly perfectly when he is taken back to the year 1955 through Doc Brown's unorthodox time machine. Despite some unusual situations the film is able to keep a whimsical charm that many Spielberg produced films from the era possessed. Not to mention great direction from Robert Zemeckis who simultaneously captures the spirit of the 1980's through the character of Marty McFly as well as perfectly replicating the feel of the 1950s in the setting. While it can not be ignored the plot holes that would be apparent in any film involving travel to the past the film is such an enjoyable experience that I did not question it. With universal appeal to both children and adults through its clever humor and originality this will definitely be a classic for a long time to come.

Like, can you think of someone who can make a masterpiece/classic about a teen boy traveling trought time with an actual DeLorean as a time machine? While, Robert Zemeckis definetly found a way!This movie is what i can call a absolute PERFECT combination. A combination of storytelling, writing, suspense, action, effects, acting and music. All of these things are just PERFECT in this film! That's why this movie truly is one of a kind. Something that Robert Zemeckis also did brilliantly with other movies of his in the 80's and 90's, like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" or ""Forrest Gump"".The movie just has this magic to it that ANYONE can enjoy, no matter who or how old you are. The main characters, Marthy and Doc Brown, are some of the most enjoyable and iconic characters in fiction to date, they are just a blast to watch! Including supporting characters, like Biff or Marthy's parents.The action scenes are also enjoyable and even more with the excellent special effects and music attached to it. And the story of the film is brilliant as well.Of course we've seen many time travel movies before, but the way how they did it in this one is incredible. This movie is truly a masterpiece and i can't have enough of it. I highly suggest to at least watch this movie ONCE in your lifetime, you won't regret it.

It is 1 of 2 movie series I can watch and rewatch and find it a complete almost flawless piece of storytelling - the other being Lord Of The Rings.That being said I would like to see the effects digitized in BTTF. Digital effects are infinitely better than analog ones - and the addition of such in BTTF would only further render timeless these films. I am a bit discouraged that Zemeckis hasn't done such already. I would want my pieces of art to be state-of-the-art and maintained forever onwards. George Lucas knows this and I respect him proportionately for such (though I think Episodes 4-6 of Star Wars need a lot of work).Anyway, back to BTTF. Watch it and enjoy it.

From start to finish the story build to a climax with the clock tower scene. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I know almost every line of this movie. If anyone loves this movie as much as me, please feel free to e-mail me. Because this film is so underrated. I think it gives a new meaning to Generation gap. Anyway story goes like this, You've got your typical 80's teenager(Marty) and typical semi-mad scientist(The Doc), who just happen to be friends. and the Doc invites Marty to help with one of his experiments, and it ""all goes horribly wrong"" and Marty ends up being send back in time 30 years and as he approaches the town he's lived in all his life(presumably), he just happens to run into his parents and prevents them from meeting, then he finds the Doc, who at first doesn't believe him but after some convincing, helps him to get his parents together and send him ""Back To The Future"" hence the title.

946,future boy,If only all films were this good...,10,7 August 2000,"Aged 7, this film blew me away.  Aged 21, I'm still enthralled by its charms.  Basically, BTTF is everything you could want from a movie.  It has action, adventure, romance, good vs. evil, laughs and, above all, a heart. It's a film that you care about.Michael J. Fox gave a career-defining performance as Marty McFly. Christopher Lloyd excelled as his mentor Doc Brown. The supporting cast were simply terrific.Everyone has wondered what it would be like if we could go back in time and meet your parents.  This film takes this already-enticing proposition and turns it into a story of ingenious excellence.  BTTF is hard to criticise, bar all the unanswerable technicalities about time travel.  The special effects look as good today as they did in 1985 but the film is more than that.Back to the Future represents the way blockbusters used to be made.  The plot, characterisation and a developed sense of empathy with the characters are every bit as important as ""getting to the action.""BTTF's sequels were good but came nowhere near to the sheer brilliance of this one.  It's well-structured and well-paced, clever, humourous and has a fittingly superb soundtrack.  Alan Silvestri's score encapsulated the action perfectly and 'The Power of Love,' employed to great effect, remains one of the songs of the '80s.The DeLorean was the perfect time machine, everyone's choice of time-travel transport.  The unravelling of the story, with the revelation that only a bolt of lightning could supply the car with sufficient power to send Marty home, provided the film with one of the all-time great finales.As a film of its type, it will never be bettered.  Robert Zemeckis' filmmaking future remains in the past.  He might as well retire.  He peaked in 1985.",Back to the Future

The switch from a comedic moment to a dramatic moment and back again is done so well that it's still beleivable.The final climax of the movie has got to be the best  sequence of events ever put into a sequence.  One thing after another goes wrong.  Marty must accellerate to 88 and have the hook on the top of the car meet the wire over that street at the precise moment that the lighning strikes the clock tower.

Even though there are more modern ideas that have been created about the side effects, I still think you can still enjoy Doc Browns version every time you watch, because of the way the film was made.This is one of my favorite films and I'll always be able to re-watch it ever once in awhile, because of the wonderful special effects that haven't lost there touch and still look fresh, time has been good to this film (no pun intended).

Couple that with an original storyline, a weird and wacky duo (Michael J.

It was a lot of fun, it was an homage to the innocence of the 50's and had some really cool science fiction elements.It propelled Micheal J.Fox from a TV star with Family Ties to a full on movie star. It was the big breakout movie that Robert Zemekis had been so desperately seeking ( I personally think Romancing the Stone was just as good) and it cemented writer Bob Gale as one of the screenwriting greats.If you haven't seen this movie yet, go stream it or better yet buy it. Back to the Future is worth more than a few watches and will becomes a mainstay as a feel good film you can return to over and over again.If you know this movie or grew up with it like I did, stop reading this review and go put it on.

I have been in love with this movie ever since I was a kid and I still watch it regularly. It's such a fun story, and the plot is more in depth than most people realize.

Back to the future is about an regular, somewhat nerdy 80s teen named Marty McFly who is played by Michael J. Fox. He is accidentally sent back to the year 1955 in a nuclear-powered time machine that Dr. Emmett Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd) invented. He meets up with his parents and he accidentally alters time making it so his dad (played by Crispen Glover) and his mom (played by Lea Thompson) don't meet and fall in love. Therefore, Marty needs to try to get his parents to fall in love and he needs to return to the year 1985. With a great cast, much humor, and a lot of heart; Back to the future is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys excellent movies. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and anyone who passes out on this movie is missing out.",Back to the Future

I've watched many films like this and i must say this comes out on top, there are very little flaws and it truly stood the test of time for its amazing special effects. The acting was very impressive from both Michael j fox and Christopher Lloyd. they both played there parts exceptionally well and fitted their characters perfectly. The Music is also very good and will be very memorable in film history. finally i have to say i cant really point out any flaws and i find it hard to imagine that people wont enjoy this film.

Micheal J fox is ideal to play the Marty McFly character. He accomplishes the tasks of being an innocent teen who is stuck in a situation that he is not able to get out yet he can totally play a bad ass when he sticks up for his friends.Christoper Lloyd is hilarious as the crazed yet totally sane scientist.a recommendation for all the ages. there are not really any objectionable parts but some may find some scenes quirky. i don't know if that is considered a spoiler. its a sci fie, a triller a family film and geneaally a great film.",Back to the Future

Fox's (Marty McFly) best acting performance of all-time.  Christopher Lloyd is brilliant once again, Thomas Wilson plays a great bully, and Lea Thompson was also excellent.  I am only a teenager and have seen the film at least 1,000 times.  This is one of those movies that never get boring, the movie that you drop everything your doing to see it once again, and one that can see with family, friends, or anyone!  I like many other fans treasure this picture and will always treasure.  No other trilogy will be even close to match it.  Not Jurassic Park, not Austin Powers, not even Star Wars, NONE!!!

The average time travel movie is surreal but, in this case, because of the way the story is told, I find it pretty real. One can almost start believing in time travel and all! I really enjoyed Marty McFly performing one of the (in my opinion...) best songs in human history, Johnny B. Goode. The dance is great, and the comment afterwards: ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it."" It is great to see Marty starting to understand his parents' choices better by knowing them as teenagers. It is always funny to see him make mistakes though: ""Dad"" becomes ""Dad, dad, daddy-o"", and so on.That's pretty much everything I have to say about Back to the Future...",Back to the Future

Out of all the TV Series and Films Michael has stared in, my favourite of all times being, Back To The Future both I, II & III, they are the best ones of all films of all times, as with the story line, set up, editorial work and mostly acting from all actors, there wasn't one single mistake whatsoever. Family Ties is a TV series that should be back on TV in the UK too, as some of the shows they have on TV could do with being wiped off altogether, after all with Happy Days being on, which my little girls love, I'm sure if they were to bring on Family Ties, they'd be just as happy, as they're also fans of Back To The Future as well.",Back to the Future

1022,seany_chacks,Timeless Classic,10,29 March 2005,"There are certain films that you grow up with. You see them on TV all the time and feel compelled to watch. I have seen Back To The Future more times than i care to imagine. Each and every time i watch it, it never fails to get me hooked straightaway. What is it about this film that makes it endlessly watchable? The main character is a kid i wanted to be. I even tried to copy his famous skateboard trick on a number of occasions- each time managing to hurt my shin in the process. The film centres around Marty Mcfly played by Michael J. Fox. He is accidentally transported back in time to the year 1955 where he inadvertently prevents his parents from falling in love-hence threatening his very existence. It may sound complicated but the genius of the film is the simplicity of the script. In short, Marty just wants to get back home. To assist him in his quest is the man who helped him get there in the first place (you still with me? good). Doc Brown is as eccentric as they come but Christopher Lloyd makes him lovable with his great performance. The chemistry between Michael J. Fox and the afore mentioned Lloyd is the key to the entire movie. It works a treat, making the film come to life. Watching Marty and Doc struggle to put their well thought out plan into action at the film's climax is as exciting as anything seen. The scale of this movie is not huge. It's not a big special effects film. Yes it does involve time travel and yes it's a big adventure. However, it's the characters-not a big budget- that make this film special. The score makes the film jump out of the screen.. The Back To The Future main theme is one of the most recognised in cinema. Only very special films tap into popular culture and this movie sits proudly alongside the Star Wars' and Indiana Jones'of this world.. The phrase 'Back to The Future' will be with us forever- just as this classic movie will be. 'Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads'",Back to the Future

I thought that was the coolest movie ever. Over the years it has been on countless times late at night, and still, I sit there and watch it again. I might know the next scene or line that is coming up, but I'm laughing anyway. This film shows best friends, love interests, rock-n-roll, and a time travelling Delorean. It also touches on the ethics of scientific progress, If we could travel through time, what would be the consequences of our actions? I recommend this film to anyone that would just like to have a fun time watching a movie, just don't try to ruin the fun by overanalyzing the facts.

So Marty has to tell Doc about this accident too in 1955. Will he able to solve all...or...!? This movie is enjoyable for men and women of all ages I think.

His wild and whacky friend Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, builds a time machine, out of a Delorean, and soon Marty is back in 1955, where he disrupts his parents first meeting and falling in love. The ensuing romp is amusing and engaging on all levels. You hate the bad guy for all the right reasons and cheer Marty on as he struggles to set things right so his parents will fall in love and he can get back to the future.

I am happy to say that this movie is the benchmark that I measure all other movies and ages perfectly due to the nature of the story. Christopher Lloyd, Michael J Fox,Leah Thompson, Thomas F.

1048,tiwang80,masterful plot,9,1 July 2006,"Suspend your disbelief in the mind-bending time-traveling premise; set aside the ultra-modern DeLorean (which still looks way ahead of our time 20 years later); peel back the 80s versus 50s clashing culture references; look past the extremely well-played cast of stock characters (the dashing, adventurous Marty, freaky fitful Doc, bullying Biff, timid pining George); mute the magnificent musical score; and strip away the splendid special effects (esp. the enduring parallel flame trails) and you have, in my opinion, the centerpiece and finest component of the movie--its superbly arranged plot. Movies tell stories. Stories have conflicts and problems that characters have to overcome. Back to the Future's plot is fantastic mix of interwoven conflicts. There are the character problems--Doc's dilemma about the morality of his scientific endeavors; McFly's family discord; Marty's growing pains. There are major plot problems--Doc's quest to test his machine; Marty getting stuck in time and trying to reconstitute his family. And then the film weaves in a myriad of subplots and little problems. The last half-hour of the movie throws one obstacle after another as Marty out of the locked school, fights off Biff, takes center stage, overcomes the downed cable, and still manages to get back in time to save Doc. Take the intricate plot and throw in all the other fine elements, and we've got a movie that keeps the viewer at the edge of the seat all the way up to 88mph. Then, with the denouement of the story, every the conflicts is resolved. There are no loose ends. There are no extraneous characters; everyone with a problem has it fixed by the end. The complete closure leaves a hook for the next episode. The special effects fit nicely within the story and do not overwhelm it (unlike so many films nowadays). Same for the music. At the end of the day, Back to the Future is a great story that leaves the viewer with plenty of plot to digest. Best appreciated over several viewings.",Back to the Future

Prepare yourself to take the biggest adventure Back to the Future when you watch this film. I think this film will always be known as one of the big movie classics for years to come. I wasn't born when this film was first brought out in the cinemas but I remember from an early age watching this with my family and being completely awestruck by how great this movie was. I remember it made me want to go and build my own time- machine (sniggers) and head back to certain times in history, as well as speeding forward into the future to see what my future self would be like. Well, if there's one thing that is guaranteed, throughout my future from my early age, I have always been a massive fan of this film.",Back to the Future
1050,hoyt08,Back to the Future Review,9,11 December 2016,"There are some movies that you can view again and again especially when you grew up in the 80's. The films that came to mind also helped me remember childhood memories from the first viewing of Top Gun, Beetle Juice, The Breakfast Club, and the movie I most recently viewed Back to the Future with Michael J. Fox. As I viewed Back to the Future again, I could view the components that kept my attention back from younger years and even to this day. The movie's central focus was on a teenager, Marty that had a crazy scientist friend Dr. Brown. Although he was told not to associate with the scientist by the principle, Marty being the typical teenager, that didn't stop him. The story goes on leading you through scenes of the upbeat life style of a teenager of the 80's ridding his skate board as the sound of rock-n-roll music drowned all noises except the his interactions with his parents and a bully named Biff. The excitement rises as Marty goes to visit Dr. Brown, clocks ticking, alarms sounding, music sets the emotion of excitement. Marty meets up with Dr. Brown and witnesses the Dr.'s latest experiment called time travel. The theme is pronounced throughout the movie. Director, Robert Zemeckis introduces the characters and their change with time only in reverse. The first introduction of the characters playing Marty's parents are in a present time, 1985. Stories are vocalized by the mother of how the she first met their father George, ugh. Marty and his sister, Linda are very tired of listening to this story. Editing brings this scene to the viewer's attention using outside/in, leading you into another scene further in the movie. Lighting of the film was appropriately placed as scenes changed, from time travel full of sound and colors to the settings of past, 1955 colors to the more flaming colors of the present, 1985. The excitement begins when Marty witnesses Dr. Brown being shot by foreign terrorists. The dramatic sound as shots being fired, music tone drops in the scene only to transition to a faster tempo matched the pace with the scene as the terrorists begin to chase after Marty. Marty jumps into the DeLorean/ time machine and the chase begins. Continued are angled views through Marty's eyes of the digital displayed date and year with another date and year set back to 1955. The sounds of screeching tires and gun shots along with a fast-paced music sets for excited emotions with Marty speeding from his predators. The focus changes quickly and the angle of the speedometer comes to focus as it reaches 88 mph and with the sounds of a screeching swoosh, as the burning flames ignite sending Marty back in time. Upon his arrival in 1955, unexpectedly Marty is lead to his parents in the time they were teenagers. As the story proceeds it gathers your thoughts from a previous transition of editing scenes from the introduction and conversations of how the parents met. Marty, accidentally runs into his father, George at the town's local dinner. Curiosity leads Marty to follow George as he leaves, setting the transition of editing back to the time when George was hit by a car and met his mother. Only leading into more action. Marty interacts with the past occurrence and pushes his father to safety and gets hit by the car himself. Scenes begin to twist with the time, as his mother, Lorraine is introduced as a teenager to Marty who is now in place of George, as his mother, Lorraine now develops a crush on Marty. Conflicting thoughts and transitional emotions of the Marty taking place of George with is Lorraine. Marty must re-start time or find a way of bring his parents back to the first time they met or the family will disappear in the present time, 1985. The director doesn't let go of the movie's theme from scene to scene with the continued views of clocks and sounds of ticking, transitioning from the development of change from time and place. The director uses adult and teenage ethics and thoughts that change the emotional views through the movie. The action and excitement kept my attention from the first time I saw the movie to the most recent time. Even with a new-found viewing I've learning from the class of Film Appreciation. As I analyzed my viewing, I found the movie was one that I enjoyed to watch and continue to find entertaining. Back to the Future (1985) continues to be a movie to be viewed.",Back to the Future

This movie had everything comedy, action, imagination and best of all a great plot which carried on throughout parts 2 + 3 I would recommend this movie to anybody and by just watching this you will see for yourself why you must see the sequels. This movie rates in my top ten movies of all times, whilst the trilogy of back to the future is second only to the Star Wars Adventures.

I think that alone is a testament to its power; I've never been bored by it once and I don't think I ever will be.Top to bottom, everything in this movie works. From the acting to the directing to the story to the music to the visual effects, it's quite simply the most enjoyable movie experience I can imagine. Really, I think this is what movies should be all about--watching some moving pictures and having fun. That's the best word to describe ""Back to the Future."" Fun.So if you've never seen this movie before, don't take my word for it (I'm not qualified enough for you to do that). Just go out and rent it and watch it and enjoy it and watch it again. You owe it to yourself.",Back to the Future
1058,gail-clarke-331-131855,Classic Summer Blockbuster,10,4 April 2012,"This ranks right up there with my favorite movies of all time. What a great time to be alive! This movie was done with style, and will always be the best sci-fi movie around. The acting is remarkable; Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) are the standouts in the film. Fox does a wonderful job portraying the average 80s teenager, while Lloyd made his voice heard in his career best performance. As for Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson, they add another ring to the story, and give it comedy, a rare occurrence in science fiction. There are several things that I could note telling how good this movie was. The concept of traveling through time has never exactly done well in the theaters before, but ""Back to the Future"" worked, as did its sequels. The small things also made this movie what it is today, like how realistic the 1950s were. During those scenes, you can imagine it being a 50s movie done in color. Also, the usage of the Delorean seemed like the perfect car for the time machine. To sum things up, I quote Doc, talking about the Delorean used for the time machine. ""If you're gonna make a time machine, why not do it with some style?"" And that's exactly how Zemeckis made this fantastic movie, with style.",Back to the Future

Marty has decided to set his return time earlier than the time he originally departed. This is so that he can warn the Doctor of his coming death. The thing is when he does this and gets to the car park because he's late, he sees the attack taking place from a 3rd person view and he sees himself get into the time machine and drive into 1955. If Marty, was able to get there in time to warn the Doctor and they managed to avoid the attack, what would have happened in 1985 because we would have had 2 Marty(s), from 1985, since Marty who jumped in the machine would not have had to go to 1955?",Back to the Future
1061,nnjjll2,great,10,6 June 2012,"one of my favorite movies. well thought out and planned. I love Steven Spielberg. Micheal j fox was great. in the beginning I did not know if it was good or not but by the end I could not take my eyes off the screen. Overall excellent. It starts out with a boy named Marty Mcfly. He is friends with a some what crazy scientist named emit brown, doc who invites Marty to go see his latest invention. It turned out to be a time machine in a Delorean. doc gets shot by some terrorists who doc tricked. Marty gets in the Delorean and drives for his life. when the car reaches 88 miles per hour he goes back to 1955. The people back then got freaked out when they saw him. he found his dad first, found out he was a peeping tom, then saves him from being hit by a car. That was a big mistake. he was awakened by his mom who was attracted to him. He finds doc from 1955. Thats when he realizes that his mom is in love with him instead of his dad. he must fix that while he finds out how to get back to 1985. he makes his dad develop courage and punch the bully who has bullied him for his entire life. then doc figures out that when lightning strikes the clock tower. Marty gets through just in time. that is a small summary you will have to watch the whole movie to really get it. overall excellent, 10 of 10",Back to the Future

1063,davonator97,Great Sci-Fi Classic that is impossible not to love!,10,11 July 2017,"Robert Zemeckis created this masterpiece back in 1985, which is the same year the plot takes place. Marty McFly gets sent back in time 30 years where his mother falls in love with him instead of his father and endangers his entire existence. So his mission becomes to get his parents to fall in love all over again while he also has to get back to 1985 in time. The story is so entertaining that you'll never get bored and will want to re-watch it several times. I love how the movie has small details in almost every scene that add to the story and will sometimes only be found upon re-watching the movie. Overall it's a perfect mixture of Adventure and Comedy. The characters are all very likable especially Marty and the bit eccentric Doc Brown.The technical aspects of the film are very well executed especially the visual effects (for the time). Considering the producers had to re-shoot entire scenes all over again due to the recasting of Michael J. Fox the movie doesn't suffer from this at all. I would also like to mention the brilliant score composed by Alan Silvestri which adds a great sense of adventure to the plot and is recognized by most people instantly upon hearing it.Overall Back to the Future is a timeless classic that stays entertaining upon countless viewings and is impossible to hate, even though it has it's flaws (which movie doesn't?) but compensates these with a great story, great dialog, great execution and a brilliant score. For me definitely a 10/10 score and a ""must see"" movie.",Back to the Future

1065,JasmondGipson,Mankind Vs Time,7,19 October 2012,"Since the beginning of time we have wondered, what it would be like to rewind time, and undo those things we either did not intend to do, or to do something we should have done in the past. This could alter our lives, in the present or future as we know it. The movie Back to the Future (1985), allowed me to live this fantasy. Although, the plot was based on a realistic scientific possibility, I know it to be just a fantasy in realization.The plot was Doc Brown, (Christopher Lloyds) creation that a DeLorean could indeed travel through time. However, during a bad transaction that had taken place with the Doc, and some extremists, the Doc was shot and killed, while Marty (Michael J. Fox), the lead character escapes the shootout in the famed Delorean automobile. The car would travel back in time, to 1955, as he was driving away at a heightened rate of speed in the automobile. The thrill of this movie for me begins when Marty travels back in time, and he accidentally gets hit by his grandfather in his own car. He was then taken to his home for care, where his young mother, falls in love with him. This would create a chain reaction, which would prevent his mother and father from ever meeting and would put his own, existence at stake.Throughout this movie his whole mission was to find the old Doc, so he could help him get back to 1985. This strategic maneuvering would ensure that his mother and father met, and inform the Doc about what happens to him in the future, so he could hopefully prevent it. After all this was accomplished the goal was to dodge the character of the story, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), the young man who was head over heels for Marty's mother. Biff wasted no time clobbering Marty every chance he got, in order to make Marty's mother not like Marty, by proving that Marty was a non-worthy wimp. Overall the idea of going back in time was awesome! However, the whole idea of my mother being attracted to me was very creepy. I believe that many of the movie goers would agree with me. Yes, the technological twist, drama and theatrics were great for its time (1985); but the close relationship, between mother and son, was a little over the top for me.",Back to the Future
1066,makaikost,"""Back to the Future"": good film or astonishing film?",10,9 November 2012,"""Back to the Future"" good film or astonishing film?""Back to the Future"" is a film loved by many. Specifically, ""Back to the Future"" is exciting and adventurous. Moreover, it has great acting. Subsequently, the series of events was so good they had to make 3 movies to fit the whole plot of the story. ""Back to the Future"" is a brilliant movie.Fundamentally, ""Back to the Future"" is extremely thrilling and venturesome. Presumably, the main characters Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) go back to the future. Accordingly, the main character, Marty McFly, goes to the past in a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Ultimately, he causes a lot of issues and starts to fade away. Significantly, the main attraction that people look for in a good film is the acting. Furthermore, when the director of ""Back to the Future"" ( Robert Zemeckis), hired actors such as Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson and Claudia Wells, you won't get anything less than superior. Additionally, the characters in the movie do not leave in the second and third; each piece to the puzzle overlaps and you'll find characters in the same place that they were left in the very first film. On the other hand, time travel isn't real and is initially impossible. Some may find it childish and absurd. Conversely, isn't that why people watch movies? To get the feeling that they went somewhere else; to feel as if they really preformed the action the character just attempted. ""Back to the Future"" is an adventure like no other and is suspenseful throughout the entire production. Comparatively, most films have an easy plot and the story line is plain yet dull. However, ""Back to the Future"" is not like that at all. To demonstrate, the first movie of the series was spectacular. Initially, it had a great special effects and left you on a cliff hanger in the end when Dr. Emmett Brown says ""roads, we don't need roads"" and the DeLorean takes off into the sky. Henceforth, the characters go through three main settings; The Past, The Future, and The Wild West. The very end of ""Back to the Future"" is astounding and inspirational. Predictably, I would greatly suggest seeing this movie. Therefore, are you into suspenseful adventures? If they are you're thing, I would say that you need to look into seeing ""Back to the Future"". Ultimately, you will not regret it and you certainly will love what you have seen.",Back to the Future
1067,spymedia,The movie was superb!,9,8 August 2004,"The minute I saw Michael J. Fox in Doc's house putting in wires here and there connecting to the large speaker and then it blasts-I was laughing away! I have hardly seen any movie that starts of funny! The making of the car is brilliant and I thinks that with so little special effects it is really the best! Many movies have this thing about wishes, they wish for it and ta da it happens-but hello how did it happen?! This car thing is really good for imagination and really persuades people to enjoy and let their fantasies fly with the characters in the movie. The best part I liked-I was snickering, when Michael-'Marty' is hit and found by Lorraine who is actually his mother brings him into her house and she has some feelings for him and 'wants him'-he freaks out! That was really funny, like I never thought of such a case when he is to see his parents in high school. It was really cool! The imagination is so rich that you feel like you are in the movie and enjoying the humor and the tensions that Marty has! There was one thing that bothered me-by the end of the movie when Marty wakes up and he walks by the dining room he stops and sees something really weird, there are different furniture and he spots his brother in his business suit and is unaware what it is, then he sees his parents and then collapses how did he end up here when his parents look older and there is new furniture which he wasn't familiar with and he ended up having a jeep? Plus when Doc turns up he has a new way of making gas It's confusing! But it didn't really matter because the movie was the greatest! I wouldn't mind if they make a newer version of these series of Back to the Future, with more visual effects and more action!",Back to the Future

And it is not just comedy alone which makes this film so enjoyable. It is also the unique insight it offers into a situation which we could never hope to experience, that of seeing our parents as teenagers.

I also love it when doc brown says that he needs 1.21 gigglewats to make the car go .If you also a fan of Drake and josh they even made a reference to the car in the Christmas episode movie. My favorite scene is at the dance scene where George finally stands up to Biff and punches him, and kisses Lorane to finally make things right .

Also this film really manages to overcome the big loopholes which are very common in time travel films, but this film addresses these issues and discusses the ways of a paradox and how it's dangerous to change the past as it may cause danger in the future. WATCH IT! NOW!",Back to the Future

It is an exciting movie about a young man named Marty McFly Who travels back in time and can't get back. I think the score is the best score invented to a movie since James Bond Dr. No. It is an original score that really sticks in your head. Don't worry you won't hate that. I would like to thank Alan Silvestry for creating the biggest orchestra to make a movie score because I think he did a wonderful job and really made the music go with the movie. Me and my family I think have the biggest knowledge of Back to the Future probably in the entire United Kingdom. So take my word for it when I say this movie is the most exciting, suspenseful, and lovable thing you will ever see.",Back to the Future

I looked up the director at this site IMDb.com and it says he directed too many great movies like Forest Gump, Contact, way too many to list. I guess I'll have to watch them in time.

My first boyfriend asked me out by showing me this movie. Basically what I'm trying to say, is that this movie is fantastic. Back to the Future has elements for everyone, and is great for watching with the family or relaxing by yourself. The DeLorean has become such an icon, and it's no wonder! The film sets up great jokes and entertainment throughout the entire story, and fantastic one-liners. ""Great Scott!"" ""Man this is heavy"" and my personal favorite ""Why don't you make like a tree and get outta here?"" are some of the best in movie history.

1084,vanburen-sama,An original and inventive film,10,17 February 2014,"Back to the Future is an amazingly executed science fiction comedy that pulls the audience into the world of time travel. Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back in time in a time machine that his friend, the mad scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd), invented. Once in the past, Marty meets his parents when they were teenagers. He accidentally messes with the time line and his mother falls for Marty instead of his father. Marty must fix this while Doc from the past finds a way to send Marty back to his own time. If Marty cannot get his parents together in time, he will disappear from existence.Director Robert Zemeckis creates an original and inventive film that that entrances the audience. However, he does not pull this off on his own. He has a wonderful cast that truly brings the script to life. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make an amazing team. They both embody their characters and when you put them together, movie magic happens. Their facial expressions, vocal expression, and physicality make their performance interesting, believable, and likable. Their interactions verbally and non-verbally when they are sending the DeLorean back in time for the first time is priceless, because of the way their eyes speak to each other and to the audience, and their physical actions magnify the intensity of their emotions. Through this, they create a scene of suspense but one that the audience can still laugh along to. Without these two actors the movie is just that, a movie; but, they create an adventure, a comedy, and overall a story that has become a classic. The music selection for this film is spectacular and plays an important role. This movie incorporates the big hits of each time period, and this does not only appeal to the audience, but also sets the mood of the movie. ""The Power of Love,"" by Huey Lewis and the News was written for this film and ended up giving the band its first number-one hit. This upbeat and overall fun song to sing along to gets the audience ready for a light hearted rocking good time. Another big hit, ""Johnny B. Goode"" by Chuck Berry is performed in this movie and is now considered to be one of the most recognizable songs in music history. Music truly can bring you back in time and this is what makes Back to the Future a hit even now. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and something new can be learned every time. Everything that is said and shown in this movie has a purpose. Whether that is a newspaper clipping, a license plate, or a phrase that is said, the director put them each there on purpose, to make the audience think. The attention to detail is amazing. One example is how the mall sign changes from ""Two Pines Mall"" to ""Lone Pine Mall"" later in the movie because when Marty was back in time he ran over one of the pines. Back to the Future is a movie that will never get old. It was a masterpiece of its time and is still a masterpiece today.",Back to the Future
1085,thegreat1_921,simply one of the best movies ever,10,18 April 2005,"This movie may have came out when I was only 3, but it is my all-time favorite because it combines suspense, comedy, and mystique all together in the same film. The casting was intense with the hilarious Christoper Lloyd playing the eccentric Dr. Brown, and Michael J. Fox as the typical 80's teenager Marty McFly. I won't give the movie away, but Marty must get back from 1955 to his era of 1985 AND make sure that his parents fall in love. Otherwise, he and his siblings will never be born! The next 2 movies may have been less than amazing, but this movie starts it all.

1086,pyjin0617,Hollywood classic movie,7,26 May 2014,"'Back to the future' is about time travel. This movie was released in 1985. The story of this movie is that one weird scientist invented a time machine. Marty, a friend of him, accidentally used the machine and went back to the past. He went to 1950s when Ronald Reagan was still a second-rate actor. He met his parents who were very young and changed their life. Then he came back to the future. The plot is simple but gripping at the same time. The scene which Marty's mother fall in love with her son, not knowing who he is, was hilarious. Marty tried hard to unite his high-school-age parents to save his own existence. Also, it was so interesting to see what the life in America was like in 1980s. For instance, people usually wore checked shirt, jeans and Nike sneakers. I was surprised that They are not that different from today. Even though this movie is a little bit old and predictable, the movie was so much fun that I lost count of the time. Good casts, nice plot, humor, love and music well mixed in this movie.

When you see this movie you think he never seems to get old. he could even play a teenager 10 years after finishing the 1st part!

Because the link could holds two people together. At that moment I thought what would happen to them if Marty does not make his parents meet? I cannot imagine. It is not really predictable.

The other 2 movies are also well worth watching but you can't beat the original. I love the story line and you get to know each character quickly and you can relate to each one of them especially Marty played by Fox, I understand he was working on family ties and back to the future all at the same time wow he must have been tired.I would like to point out how cleaver this movie is because of the time travel element this is not easy to pull off but they do it so well.

Especially the people who don't like science fiction, because they'll learn to like it. It's great, the geek gets the girl, the bully is taken down, there's a crazy doctor and the kid fixes his parents' past. It's pretty amazing. The characters themselves were true to the setting and represented the 1980's and the 1950's perfectly. The DeLorean was the coolest time machine ever. If I learned anything from this movie, it's that you have to ride in style. It had a great plot, good camera work, some scientific accuracy, and a smooth ending. While I loved all of those things, there are a few things I would change. There were a few questions that weren't answered. What happened between 1955 and 1985 that made things the way they are? There are too many things that happened in those thirty years that weren't explained. Biff, George, and Loraine still had lives and their stories weren't explained. And then, on top of that, unless you see ""Back to the Future Part II"", the ending is just a huge cliffhanger. Why does the DeLorean suddenly fly? Who what's wrong with Marty's kids? What does Doc mean ""Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads!""? I guess ending it that way was a good move because then, you want to see Part II, you NEED to see Part II, or else you'll be left with a million questions that are left unanswered. It was the greatest, strangest, and most confusing two minutes of the entire movie, but that's what makes it so great. All in all, it was a great movie and definitely a science-fiction classic.

The film's observation that, in those days, a name sewn onto the back of one's pants was probably one's own is only one of the shrewd, rueful contrasts it draws between 1955 and the present day. Once Marty (played winningly by Michael J. Fox) steps into the specially equipped DeLorean owned by a mad scientist friend of his and floors the accelerator, he finds himself in a much simpler world. The neighborhood where he will someday live hasn't even been built. The local soda jerk thinks anyone who orders a Pepsi Free (''If you want a Pepsi you gotta pay for it!'') is being a wise guy. The town's movie theater is playing a Ronald Reagan film, and when Marty announces that Mr. Reagan will be President some day, he is met with a stare of disbelief and a sarcastic remark about Vice President Jerry Lewis. One of the things all teenagers believe is that their parents were never teenagers. Their parents were, perhaps, children once. They are undeniably adults now. but how could they have ever been teenagers, and yet not understand their own children? This teenagers by being one. But ""Back to the Future"" is even more hopeful: It argues that you can travel back in time to the years when your parents were teenagers, and straighten them out right at the moment when they needed help the most.

Michael J.Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson are all fantastic. Some people tell me it looks dated now because of the 1980's costumes.

( I have since gone on to complete a BA Honours in Film Studies, and am just reigniting my passion for cinema).30 years later, and now that we have reached the milestone 2015 (the year Marty travels to the future in part two) this is still one of the most entertaining and well written movies of recent history. Everything fits perfectly into place from the script, camera-work and score, with memorable characters who each produce consistently great performances throughout the trilogy. Back to that opening sequence, a true example of fine film-making, this sequence inundates us with information and references, all vital to the plot, but at first glance, these visuals and sounds seem to be a random mix. The panning scene of the numerous clocks being an obvious reference to the major theme of ""time"", the newspaper clippings documenting the history of the Brown family, and the TV in the background, first advertising the Toyota pickup truck, the vehicle Marty pines for, and which becomes his eventual reward for fixing and rehabilitating his family through his actions in the film, to the news report of missing plutonium.You just have to look at how props, imagery and fashion from the movies have entered our own popular culture to see the impact this film has made on our generation. This ranges from the iconic Delorean Time Machine, the Nike Air Mag ""power laces"" trainers which Nike are due to release commercially, to the time old question we have all asked ourselves ""when are they finally going to invent hover boards?!"" Surely it can't be that hard!Apart from the afore mentioned , I believe one of the main reasons for the films continued success and impact, is the main concept of the film, that of time travel itself. Our desire to travel through time, the endless options of dates and locations, which I'm sure have sparked many debates amongst friends and family, along with, of course, the plausibility of time travel, and the mind bending science behind it - ""Time circuits on, flux capacitor....fluxing"".If I was to make once criticism of the film, it would be this. It is never really explained why a High School kid, Marty, spends so much time with an ageing ""mad scientist"", how they came to meet, and how they formed such a friendship. It could be understood if Marty was a shy, retiring ""nerd"", but his apparent popularity with women (note him waving to an entire aerobic class of women at the end of the first scene) make this friendship even stranger. But the on screen chemistry and comedic interaction between the characters is so great and genuine, that we accept this bizarre friendship for what it is, without asking further questions. In conclusion, how ever many times you watch this trilogy of films, you will never cease to be entertained, will probably notice something you didn't in a previous viewing, and will always want to ride a skateboard holding onto the back of a cop car.",Back to the Future

Try watching certain movies over and over and see how quickly you get sick of it. This movie is different. The depth and richness of storytelling, the characters, oh my, the characters. Doc Brown is easily one of the best and most memorable on screen characters in any film ever. Biff, Griff, Buford...best on screen bully ever! Compare this movie to other epic movies, such as Star Wars - while those types of movies are great in their own right, Back to the Future is different. There is a warmth and comfort to the way that Bob Gale and Bob Zemekis crafted this screenplay. It's pure genius. And for all of you fans that always have to mention ""plot holes"" or ""minor flaws"" - please make sure you have seen every second of the 25th Anniversary set of the trilogy that has an entire bonus disc, as well as more bonus features and two different commentaries on the main discs. Bob Gale is aware of every little detail about his script and talks about it in the commentaries. My true love of this film came as a result of watching all the behind the scenes material - which if you haven't seen, you must see it if you're a fan of this movie. It will give you a whole new level of appreciation for this film. As someone that is into filmmaking and a total nerd about directing, cameras, technical details, I can't get enough of watching and listening to these guys talk about how everything came together just right for this masterpiece to happen.

Once planted in 1955, Marty tracks down Doc (Christopher Lloyd) his bizarre and unconventional friend. Doc invented the time travel machine and is the person responsible for Marty being in this predicament. With Doc's help, Marty is able to get Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover) to meet and fall in love. The movie is filled with many failed attempts to get this two together, along with attracting the attention of George's bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson). Once Marty is back in 1985, his world has changed for the better. George is now self confident, his mother happy and his siblings successful. Biff is now working for George and Marty and Doc reunite for another adventure. The relationship between Marty and Doc is endearing and comical and is the core of the movie. George is a likable character who you can't help but root for and so frustratingly want him to take a stand to Biff. Lorraine is an amusing character who initially falls in love with Marty until George comes along and rescues her from Biff's advances. The relationships of these characters are endearing and the movie is filled with references to pop culture and much satire.This film utilizes music and time to throughout the entire movie. The sound effects and music help to establish the era. This movie about time travel stands the test of time. Many other movies have been made about time travel but do not do it justice, such as Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Back to the Future is not a thought provoking movie nor are the effects like current big budget films; However, it has established itself as one of the best of movies of the 80's and certainly a film that can be re-watched again and again with enjoyment!",Back to the Future
1110,fritzsiegelfanclub,It's an awesome movie!,10,23 September 2015,"I got this movie for Easter from my parents and I was pretty excited about seeing this movie. When I saw the movie, I knew immediately that it had Michael J. Fox in it, which is one of my favorite actors of all time! I liked the time travel scenes when he went to 88 mph. I liked also the speed of the movie, where it went at my pace. It's so awesome, and if you haven't seen this, I HIGHLY recommend you guys seeing this movie!!! Also, when I was watching the Peeping Tom scene, my heart just went into laughter!!! If I had the chance to watch this movie again, I sure would! By the way, when I was watching the end, I thought there wasn't going to be a second movie, and it all ended there. But, I looked Back to the Future up on Amazon, and there was a part 2 and a part 3. I thought, ""Yay! There's two other Back to the Future movies! Maybe I can watch them!"" I got them for Christmas last year, and I've enjoyed both of them! Your Future is Whatever you Make it!"" -Doc Brown Fritz Siegel",Back to the Future

IT'S A COMBINATION OF FUN AND SERIOUS STORY TELLING",Back to the Future
1112,stepanova-78162,One of my favorite movies,10,20 October 2015,"Back to the future — it is a movie made by Robert Zemeckis, which gave rise to one of the most iconic franchises in cinematography about time traveling teenager Marty McFly and his friend and inventor Emmett Brown. Impossible to pick one thing, what exactly I like, because of the advantages this film has. In General, the plot of this film is laid out very good , in the most minute detail. The cast is really great: Christopher Lloyd gave us the image of the eccentric, but undeniably brilliant Doctor Brown, Michael Fox who played the character Marty McFly, Lea Thompson, who played 17-year- old girl and her 30 years later. Crispin Glover - all of his roles completely different from each other, even in ""Back to the future"" — there was one person, but he was reincarnated three times. So, the film ""Back to the future"" — one of the best representatives of its genre, wonderful exciting fantastic comedy that in many ways defined the further development of the genre. As for me, this film is really great.",Back to the Future
1113,barryo-donnell,Superb,10,23 October 2015,"This fusion of sci-fi, action, romance and comedy could have been a dreadful mess, were it not for writer-director Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale's refusal to let a loose line or idea escape their pens. The funnies come thick and fast – Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""; Marty's hapless dad (the incomparable Crispin Glover) tremblingly telling his ma ""I'm your density..."" – but more satisfying still is the intricate interplay between past and future. It turns out that Marty's Uncle ""Jailbird"" Joey loves, as an infant, to stay in his cot (""Better get used to these bars, kid""). The young Doc's incredulity on hearing of actor Ronald Reagan's next job – ""Who's Vice-President? Jerry Lewis?"" – spoke for the world, and Marty's means of returning to 1985 is a stroke of narrative genius. Scheduling clashes very nearly led to Marty's being played by Eric Stoltz, but (with all respect to the very capable Stoltz) thank heavens a solution was found, as the film would have been immeasurably the poorer without Fox's uniquely energetic charm. It's particularly cruel that so physically nimble a performer should since have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, but he continues to approach it with a hero's grace and humour, and has become a major figure in increasing awareness for the disease.",Back to the Future

I have high hopes that a 4th movie might make it's way to a theater near you soon! Great Scott Marty! The Doc was such a huge inspiration to me as a child and made me believe that anything is possible! I went to college and became a Mechanical Engineer because this movie made such a big impact on my life. One of my bucket list goals is to own a Delorean one day and cruise the interstate going 88 mph, without getting a speeding ticket lol! It would be so cool if all the original actors got together to do spoof or even better, be in the 4th movie! I am not sure if an all new cast could do this story line justice or not but I'm willing to entertain the possibilities as long as it does not displace the time-space continuum!",Back to the Future

1117,Kemi_Kentebe94,Amazing,10,25 November 2015,"Everyone needs to know that this program favorite includes sequences that place the hero and his friends in physical jeopardy: a gunfight in which a sympathetic character is thought to be killed, a van chasing a teen on a skateboard, several episodes of bullying, and more. The violence is exaggerated and closer in tone to cartoon jeopardy than real danger, but some kids will no doubt find it tense. Several scenes show the hero's discomfort when the girl who will eventually be his mother tries to entice him with kisses and embraces; there's also implied unwanted sex, but nothing serious happens. Strong language is included but nothing parents cant get teach their kids that its wrong. Amazing show and you would not regret watching it.

It's the fact that at the end of the movie when it's shown that Biff, now humbled, is working for the McFly family, waxing their cars on this particular day. It seems far fetched to believe that the McFly brood would still choose to have any contact with a man who in high school not only nearly broke George's arm, but clearly got drunk and attempted to rape Lorraine. I'm 31, and don't have contact with many bullies from High School for doing far less than that.

Its a great movie to watch with the entire family. All the actors were awesome in it and the ending and special effects were amazing. It was pretty cool that they were able to make several movies based on the original movie. I wonder how they were able to come up with such a movie. It was pretty amazing.

I would definitely watch this as it is an amazing film and that there is even more to come in the next episodes of back to the future and that is why i rate it a ten.

1134,gabrielkainer,MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME,10,3 September 2018,"When I was eight years old, my dad showed me Back to the Future for the first time, and it changed my life. Over the years, I've seen it hundreds of times, and Michael J. Fox quickly became my favorite actor ever. I love this movie so much that I've even gone to comic conventions to meet Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Tom Wilson, and Bob Gale, and I even met Crispin Glover at an Alamo Drafthouse once. This movie got me into skateboarding, and guitar playing, and it really began my fascination with the 1980s and the 1950s. Alan Silvestri's score is iconic, and so is the soundtrack featuring ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News, as well as the now iconic remakes of ""Earth Angel"" and ""Johnny B. Goode."" I have the soundtrack for this movie on vinyl as well, and it's one of the great movie soundtracks and scores. I've always been a small guy, about the size of Marty McFly/Michael J. Fox, so seeing someone like him that I could relate to made me feel cool to be short. It amazes me that Michael J. Fox did this movie with roughly four hours of sleep every night, while doing Family Ties during the day. Anyone who has been on a film set or tried memorizing lines knows that this couldn't have been easy, but hey, ""pain is temporary, film is forever."" The opening scene with the credits followed by the ""Power of Love"" scene are the perfect way to start a movie. I still re-watch this movie and catch new subtleties that I never picked up on before. When you look at the behind-the-scenes production of this movie, it's actually astounding that this turned out so perfect, especially since they ironically enough, didn't have much time. This movie is a masterpiece, especially in it's clever writing, with subtle foreshadowing in ways that remind me how they just don't make movies like this anymore. This movie has fun, and it has heart. The fact that the stakes are really so small is also a testament to the writing, because if you really think about it, the only people this whole movie would affect are Marty and his family. The stakes are so small, yet when Marty is racing to get back to the future in the finale, it is still as epic and riveting as the first time you saw it, and somehow still manages to keep me on the edge of my seat, as if I don't know what's going to happen. That's how well made this whole movie is. It's a fun, timeless movie that resonates because of the values it places on time and family.",Back to the Future
1135,tjsf-04239,Marty Mcfly heads back into 1955 and has to find his way back and not risk alternating the future.,10,26 October 2016,"Back to the Future Back to the Future is a great movie for parents and their kids with a PG rating. It is a great movie for its originality, the soundtrack, and the setting from the time changes. The setting takes place in 1985; Marty and Doc test out a time machine, but after complete chaos Marty travels into 1955 and has to find his way back! This film is full of action, comedy, and lots of science. This movie is well known for its actors and special effects, and also the famous director, Robert Zemeckis, who directed Forrest Gump.The movie has been out for over 30 years and is an instant classic. This is not your average everyday science fiction movie; it has a blend of action and comedy mixed in. With the effects of explosions and lightning bolts; you see lots of action. Also there is lots of comedy, there is a scene where Marty wakes up in his mother's room and she starts calling him Calvin because his underwear says Calvin Klein. The history behind this movie is outstanding, winning nearly 20 awards and being voted 23rd greatest movie ever in 2008.The soundtrack went perfect with the movie with hit songs like, Back in Time and Johnny B. Goode. The songs represent the time frames throughout this film and add a little irony to some of the lyrics, like in Back in Time. The soundtrack has a lot of upbeat music so it makes the film feel more happy and exciting.The setting swiftly changes from a rundown town in 1985 to a beautifully decorated 1955. You notice big changes, like: the cars, the way people dressed, and how new the buildings looked. Marty gets laughed at throughout the film because he wears a life vest and people think he is afraid that he is going to drown. There is also a scene where Marty is being chased by thugs and takes a kid's scooter and ""transforms"" it into a skateboard.This movie was filled with block busting actors, such as, Michael J. Fox, who performed as Marty McFly. Michael, after this film, got huge into acting and also performed in films like: Stuart Little, Teen Wolf, and the Frighteners. Christopher Lloyd played Doc and he also performed in other movies and TV shows. He was in the TV series Taxi, and films like the Addams Family, Dennis the Menace, and Who Framed Rodger Rabbit. Crispin Glover, who played George McFly, performed in films like: Alice in Wonderland, Friday the 13th, and Beowulf. All three of these actors are only a select few who contributed to this great film.The genre is a mix of action, comedy, and science fiction. You will see scenes of cars exploding, chase down scenes, and some explicit language, but still is safe for families to watch. There is a scene where the time travelling car vanishes into thin air and bursting into flames after reaching eighty eight miles per hour. There are lots of parts throughout the film where Marty is being chased down by terrorists and a high school bully group.I would highly recommend this film to anyone who loves science and wants to see an epic adventure about time travelling. It is a great film for families and the pace of the film is steady and the plot picks up quick. It is highly action packed and has scenes where you will not stop laughing. If you enjoy science and want to see a film with action, then this is the film for you; I give this film a rating of 10 out of 10.",Back to the Future

1138,jasonleestepp,The Growing Awareness of Marty McFly,8,4 December 2016,"Few other movies, such as Goonies and Ghostbusters, may be as quintessentially representative of the 1980's as Back to the Future. The stories central focus is on everyday 1980's teen Marty McFly, played by the charismatic Michael J. Fox, who is sent back in time by Dr. Emmet Brown who is played in a career-defining performance by Christopher Lloyd. After Marty arrived in 1955, he accidentally interferes with the events that would bring his parents together and spends the rest of the movie trying to correct this mistake while also working with 1955's Dr. Brown to figure out a way to get home. While this film is mostly a plot driven good time, there is a theme of growing awareness that threads throughout the movie.While many movies in the 80's focused on the coming of age of teenagers, such as The Goonies or Stand by Me, Back to the Future puts a slightly different twist on this theme. When we are introduced to Marty he is an ordinary teen who is reckless, likes to drink, play rock and roll, and give his parents attitude. We see this lack of respect or understanding of his parents in the dinner scene early in the movie. Then Marty is thrust back in time. While going through the process of trying to reconcile his interference with his parent's meeting, he gains an understanding of how his parents became the people they are in the future. Back to the Future puts a twist on the coming of age story here because they put Marty in the parental role who is increasing his awareness, but we also see his parents, played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover, come of age as well. We see Marty develop while he takes over the parental role in scenes where he is trying to instill confidence in his father or when he is getting on his mother for drinking and smoking. This latter instance results in his mother stating that Marty is acting like her mother.The director, Robert Zemeckis, then uses the static versus dynamic character technique to demonstrate Marty's parent's growth. The bully Biff Tannen is a very static character. As the movie progresses, he doesn't demonstrate the capability for growth. In contrast, Marty's father George does grow as he eventually becomes more self-confident and stands up to Biff. Zemeckis also uses the motif of time to stress the theme of growing awareness. Throughout the movie, we see images of clocks, hear clocks ticking, and hear clock alarms going off. This motif causes the viewer to be very aware of the passage of time which is associated with growing wiser.This theme is very effective throughout the film until the end. I think it would have been more impactful if Marty returned to the same home life he had at the beginning of the movie having gained an appreciation of who is parents are, but instead he is rewarded with the perfect life. Even though I believe the ending could have been changed to strengthen the theme of growing awareness, it is the movie's ability to resonate with viewers, who are all too aware of the passage of time and the lessons of life, that will allow Back to the Future to continue being a classic that will be revisited for generations.",Back to the Future
1139,cranfo,The action and suspense throughout this movie still excites me to this day,10,6 December 2016,"Back to the Future (1985) is one of my favorite sci-fi adventure comedies of all times. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I first seen this film when it came out in the 80's. I have watched it several times since then, as well as the 2 sequels. I watched this film again for my Art of Films class and was just as entertained this time as all the other times I had seen it; it never gets old.Michael J Fox, one of my favorite actors, plays the role of Marty McFly. Marty is a 17-year-old teenage boy who travels back in time to 1955 by jumping into the DeLorean when trying to escape from the men that shot his friend Dr. Emmet Brown, who is played by Christopher Lloyd. The action and suspense throughout this movie still excites me to this day. The film gives you the feeling of being part of the movie by relating you to the characters. Teenagers today can relate to Marty and his feelings of his parents. It is hard to imagine your parents being anything but your parents. This film is filled with moral implications such as the consequences that can happen when you bully others and the social problems that we all deal with in high school.",Back to the Future
1140,gamby-04545,Back to the Future,8,9 December 2016,"Back to the Future, is a highly enjoyable movie. That can be enjoyed,and appreciated, by both adults and children. The two main characters,Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, and Emmett Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, showed me they had great chemistry together. Swear words, where said in moderation. Compared to some movies, I have saw, the language in this movie, is like words, from a Church Hymnal. And as far as any violence in this movie, it was in the same category as a ""Road Runner,"" and ""Coyote,"" cartoon. To keep from sounding like a hypocrite, I would take my kids to this movie. (I am sure, they heard swear words before). So much for the language. I loved the sound effects, as well as the special effects, of this movie. It was sort of accelerating to hear, those lightning bolts crackle. And to see, that time vortex swirling around. It almost had me feel as though, I was being whisk into the future. The performances of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and Lea Thompson, who played Lorraine Mcfly. And Crispin Glover, who played George Mcfly were excellent. Especially, Crispin Glover, who kept this movie, on the right track. Even though, this move has a PG rating, parents should be for-warned, that there are some contents, of sexual nature in this movie. I personally think that Back to the Future, should have had a PG-13 rating. Oh, I know that it was not so sexually explicit, that it would be condemned by the Vatican. But, I am just putting myself, in the minds of some parents. And I also know, you can't please everybody all the time. Speaking for myself, I do not have a ""Hollier than thou""attitude, about this movie. Back to the Future, is a fun movie. To put this movie in perspective. I would recommend, taking the entire family to see Back to the Future. And I can almost guarantee, that your kids will not leave the theater corrupted.",Back to the Future
1141,starfishbangles,Great Classic Movie!,8,11 December 2016,"Back to the Future is one of those classic films that you'll remember for years to come. Marty Mcfly (Michael J. Fox), an American teenager living in the 80's gets sent back thirty years to 1955 in a silver DeLorean that is actually a time machine. With the help of Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), the creator of the time machine, Marty must make sure his teenage parents fall in love so that he will return to the future and regular life.One of the themes that came to mind quickly is that Marty sees his father (Crispin Glover) when he was a teenager completely different then he sees him now. So, the theme revolves around, would Marty have been friends with his father when he was the same age and gone to school together? Marty sees his dad as a scared person that told on people when they did something wrong. He was terrified of Lorraine, which is Marty's mom in the present. At the beginning of the movie, Marty had a firm mind-set of his father, but when he traveled back in time to see his father as a teenager, that all changed.One of the techniques that was used in the film that really stood out to me was the sound effects. Especially in the scene where Marty is being chased on the hover boards, the sound effects that were put in place for when Marty was pushing himself with his foot and when the hover board was ""flying"" were appropriate for the action scene. Also, when the DeLorean was going back in time, the sound effects that were used to give you the elution that he was zooming through time was perfect for the overall affect.",Back to the Future

They worked together so well that I couldn't imagine any other two people for there characters. The director did a fabulous job, he picked a wonderful cast and of course can't forget the crew that does most of the dirty work. Wouldn't it be so amazing to travel back in time. Marty (Michael J Fox) learns this lesson all to well as he finds himself needing to fix a few things in his past. Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) really adds the humor to this movie, his character is a bit weird I should say but hands down one heck of a funny guy. This movie never gets old, I have watched it over 20 times and still can't get enough of it. Enjoy this movie, it's one of a kind for sure.",Back to the Future

Not only is it endlessly re watchable, but it is gripping from start to finish and ANYONE who likes movies to any degree owes it to themselves to see this masterpiece. Any age can enjoy it, as it isn't too dumb for adults and isn't too smart for children. Every character has a unique purpose, so the movie doesn't feel bare or overcrowded. The music is arguably the best movie soundtrack of all time, as it incorporates all emotions that the movie portrays in one, consistent tone.

Few times does a story introduce characters the way in which this does while at the same time delicately setting up what will become larger plot points. At every turn, there's another little surprise that lures the viewer in more and more. I think what's most profound here as opposed to other films similar to the genre is that although it's about time travel, it's moreover about people and relationships over anything else. Somehow, the writers prevent the story from getting bogged down in technical jargon and instead have smartly allowed the story of these characters to be present above all else. In summation, constantly entertaining and forever remarkable.",Back to the Future

1146,edrewski,Enjoy watching it time and again,8,14 May 2017,So the title when I first read it made absolutely no sense to me. Until it is explained a later on in the movie why the title is given. The first time I watched the movie I did not know what to expect besides the car and the character that was shown on the cover. I found myself concerned about the well-being of Doc Brown when he was shot at early on in the movie. I highly recommend re-watching the movie to notice little things you might miss the first time. Pay attention to the opening scene inside Doc Brown's place. All in all I enjoy watching this movie on more than one occasion. Enjoyed the references they make to a certain musician as well. Sometimes they can be a corny with the jokes that are made and the acting for some of the characters feels a little forced.,Back to the Future

1149,kyle-98356,Back to the Future...did it change?,8,25 April 2017,"Back to the Future was released in July 1985 and is the story of Marty McFly played by Michael J. Fox. Marty ends up going back in time with his friend Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. Doc turned his DeLorean into a time machine powered by plutonium. They take the DeLorean back to 1955 and end up meeting Marty's parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson). While in 1955, Marty has to be sure that his teenage parents fall in love to make sure that he can make it back to 1985 alive. The theme of Back to the Future is the conversation about fate and free will. Are we all on a predetermined path that cannot change or do we have the power to change our future? Marty is able to go back to when his parents first met. As the movie progressed and his time in the past grew, he had to make sure that his parents would stay together to ensure that he had a future to go back to. Was it always supposed to be like that? In the 1955 that his parents remember before he was born, did he actually come from the future to keep them together? Or did he alter history? This is the question that is addressed in almost every movie about time travel. Do the effects of what you do in the past ripple through time toward the future?The effects of the movie were excellent for their time. The special effects used to transport the DeLorean back to 1955 made it look possible. Doc is the perfect mad scientist for the job. The DeLorean is just as crazy as him. With the switches and flashing lights, it is exactly what you would think a time machine to look like. The camera angles that are used in the movie give the viewer the experience of traveling through time. Cameras with the outside of the DeLorean in view during the time travel reveals the special effects used by the production to make it look like the car is actually traveling through the space-time continuum. Director Robert Zemeckis does a great job with the film to make the viewer think about the effects of the past on our future. If the past would change because of someone using time travel. Would it effect the future immediately? Or did the future already know about that change so nothing would change that we know of?",Back to the Future

This movie brings you into to the world of 'what could happen if someone really DID invent a time machine'. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly who is a teen who gets into trouble and needs the help of Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. It's campy, hilarious, suspenseful, and fun. A must watch for fans of time travel movies!",Back to the Future
1152,kellyguglielmi,I wouldn't change a thing about this movie!,9,30 April 2017,"The film Back to The Future was released in the US in 1985, and starred Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a high school student who is unlikely friends with Doctor ""Doc"" Emmet Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd. Doc is an eccentric inventor, who has created what he hopes to be the first ever time machine out of a DeLorean. Marty is documenting the unveiling of the time machine with Doc in the Twin Pines mall parking lot, when Doc is hunted down by the terrorists he stole the plutonium from that he needed to fuel his machine with. After Doc is gunned down by the terrorists, Marty has to flee for his life, so he jumps in the DeLorean, and accidentally speeds back in time to 1955. He meets up with a 30-year younger Doc, who has not yet invented the time machine, and mistakenly bumps into his parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson), before they were supposed to have met. He disrupts the sequence of events that should have led to them getting married, and so has to try to match them up before his own existence is put in jeopardy. He also has to help Doc fix the DeLorean so he can get back to 1985, all before it's too late. The theme of this film is courage vs. fear. Marty and his band, The Pinheads, try out for his school's Battle of the Bands, and they're turned away because they're ""too loud"". He tells girlfriend Jennifer (Claudia Wells) that he's never going to get to play in front of anyone. She tells him he needs to send his audition tape to the radio station, but he's afraid his band will be rejected, and doesn't think he could handle the rejection. He's afraid to even try because of the possibility of failing. Later, when Marty goes back to 1955 and sees that Lorraine is interested in him instead of his father, the way it should be, he tries to get George to ask Lorraine out. George doesn't even want to ask her for fear of her possibly saying no. But when George overcomes his fear and stands up to Biff to save Lorraine, she falls in love with him for his courage. This is a similar theme to the theme in the film It's a Wonderful Life, when George Bailey (James Stewart) is taken to a time when he was never born, and he sees the impact he has had on his town and the people around him. It gives him the courage to stand up to the evil businessman, Mr. Potter, and do the right thing. The special effects and studio sets made the film not only more enjoyable to watch, but helped to make the story line more believable while you watch it. Filmed in the 1980s, the special effects aren't nearly as high-tech as what we have today, but were very good for the time, and still make the time machine scenes very exciting. The film score, composed by Alan Silvestri, also helps to set the mood of the film, especially when the triumphant theme comes in during actions sequences, or when Marty or George are doing something particularly brave. The music makes you feel excited and victorious, and heightens the emotions in the film.Back to The Future is a great movie about making good life choices, doing the right thing, and standing up for yourself. Marty is able to go back in time to help his father stand up for himself and be courageous, and they both end up being better people for it. This film always has something great to teach every time I watch it.",Back to the Future

They had to push the car with a train because they were out of gas. But there was another solution! There were 2 dolorean in 1885. The first one was the dolorean that Marty find in 1955 at the beginning of the movie and that he push with the train to go back in 1985 at the end of the movie. The second one was the dolorean that Doc have hided a few days ago near the cemetery (The car that Marty find at the beginning of the movie). Why they don't take the gas from this car?There would be no problem to make a continuation to this trilogy. Even if the car in destroyed, Doc and Marty could travel the time with the train (at the end of the part 3) and use the car as many time as they want!

The violence is exaggerated and closer in tone to cartoon jeopardy than real danger, but some kids will no doubt find it tense.

1168,jarinsimon,Best Movie Ever,10,9 March 2018,"The first Back to the Future movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. It is a classic movie, and is widely considered one of the best movies Universal Studios has ever produced, even over 30 years later. Back to the Future was the first major success of Robert Zemeckis' directing career, who would later go on to direct easily recognizable movies such as Forrest Gump, A Christmas Carol, and The Polar Express among others. Michael J. Fox plays the protagonist of the movie, Marty McFly, which is one of the coolest names I have ever heard. According to empireonline.com, Marty McFly is the 12th greatest movie character of all time, higher than Iron Man, Captain Jack Sparrow, and Gandalf. Doc Brown finds himself 20th on that same list. This movie is set in the year 1985, and takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty is a 17 year old teenage boy who finds himself in a situation like any other.Marty unknowingly changes the course of his life, and history, when he accidentally takes a modified Delorean car back in time using Plutonium stolen by Libyan Terrorists. These terrorists hoped to make a nuclear weapon using this plutonium, and seeked the help of Dr. Emmett Brown. Instead of making this weapon, Dr. Brown uses the plutonium to modify a Delorean spots car and turn in into a fully functional time machine.There are many reasons why people should watch this movie, widely known as one of the best movies of the 1980s. The concept of time travel was a popular one, as Arnold Schwarzennegger's The Terminator having come out the year before. For Back to the Future to come out the next year, adding fuel to the time travel fire that The Terminator created. Some would argue that the Back to the Future trilogy is one of the greatest movie trilogies of all time, maybe even eclipsing those of The Godfather and Lord of the Rings. My personal favorite in the Back to the Future trilogy is the first one due to the plot twists it takes. The first time I had watched this movie, I really didn't know what to expect, but I was quickly fascinated by the intricacy of the plot. The plot is brilliantly interwoven in movie, with setups buried throughout the entire film. One of my favorite things about Back to the Future's plot is how the movie is centered on the idea of running out of time. A ticking clock is central symbol, counting down to the moment when Marty will be stranded forever in 1955, or even to the moment when Marty will actually cease to exist because he's interfered with his parents getting the chance to fall in love. I really enjoyed Back to the Future, and went on to enjoy the remaining two movies in the trilogy. Although millions have enjoyed this movie and place it high up on their ""All-Time"" lists, not everyone has a favorable opinion of this movie, as hard to believe as it may seem.On the IMDB website regarding Back to the Future, it was hard to find negative reviews. Considering that Back to the Future is considered one of the greatest films ever made, that finding did not come as a surprise. One of the negative comments was that the movie did not portray the idea of time travel in a serious manner. How can one possibly expect talk about the idea of time travel to be serious in a film made with the sole purpose to entertain? Back to the Future was definitely not meant to revolutionize the science of traveling through time, and should not be criticized as such. I feel that Back to the Future is unfairly criticized for its lack of ""serious talk about time travel."" Say Stephen Hawking were involved in the production of this movie. Surely the newfound seriousness would overshadow the comedy that this movie intended to be. The humor of the movie would be lost, leaving viewers confused if they are watching a childish documentary about time travel, or if they are watching a comedy that was unsure of its own identity, jumping back and forth between humor and science.",Back to the Future

1184,Gamerdude6285,BEST MOVIE OF THE 90'S,10,27 February 2019,Back to the future is the best movie from the 90's. I wasn't born yet when it was first released but I would watch it later at 13 and loved the movie ever since.,Back to the Future
1185,michelebfs,The best movie about time travel,9,7 August 2020,"The story is great very well written and with a lot of AHA moments, the costume is so vintage and cute, It's full of nice characters besides the main ones, and of course, there is Dr. Brown who is an unique person, who makes everything seems possible and easy, like stealing plutonio, but for me that's not the best part, even the DeLorean and it's trail of fire isn't the best. How they show that our choices can change things, even the the little ones, is amazing. This is a movie which will never get old, and it's for the whole family!",Back to the Future
1186,TStormMarc,"Liked as a kid, but lack of TacStorm now VERY noticeable",4,2 March 2019,"I was on a cross-country plane ride recently, and I noticed that Back to the Future was one of the movies available as one of the in-flight entertainment options. I'd seen it as a child in theaters and maybe one other time since, so I thought I'd see if it held up. Granted, I'm not a kid anymore, but I wondered if there might at least be some nostalgia value. Sadly, no. The problem is that since the last time I saw Back to the Future, I'd gotten myself a TacStorm. I couldn't help but fixate on the places where a continuously firing gun would've changed everything.For example, when the Libyans track down Doc Brown in the parking lot, all he has is a revolver that doesn't even work. Imagine if he had an automatic handgun that was already firing on its own before the Libyans even arrived, and all he had to do was aim. I realize he has to get killed for there to be a movie, but I still couldn't get over the absence of the TacStorm. Unfortunately, the movie was pretty much tainted 20 minutes in and only got worse.In the climatic scene where George McFly knocks out Biff with one punch, all I could think was how he could've easily missed or not hit him hard enough to knock him out-just imagine what would have happened to him then. But if he'd had a gun that was always firing, there'd be no doubt, just guaranteed security when he needed it most. I realize the movie was made before the TacStorm was created, but that doesn't make it any more watchable in the year 2019!As it turns out, that's not the only movie that doesn't age well because it doesn't have a TacStorm. For example, my girlfriend and I watched The Goonies recently (she had actually never seen it). She thought it was pretty good, but I said, ""You didn't notice something missing? I mean, a really HUGE omission?"" She didn't at first, but once I explained that Data wouldn't have even needed a spring-loaded boxing glove in his jacket or oil jets in his sneakers to fend off the Fratelli family if he had a gun that was always pumping out bullets, it was so obvious to her.And, sadly, even some of my all-time favorite movies have lost their luster because the TacStorm is so glaringly absent. In The Godfather, for instance, when Michael has to kill Sollozzo and McCluskey in that restaurant, Clemenza tells him not to take any chances. Well, sorry, but if he doesn't have a TacStorm, if his firearm isn't discharging continuously straight from the factory, he's taking some MAJOR chances. Plus, if he had a TacStorm, it'd still be firing when he dropped it, which would take out anyone that tried to follow him.So now I don't know if I even want to see any newer movies at all. I guess the good news is that maybe they're new enough to have the TacStorm in them, but do I want to waste money to find out? You'd think with four guys in the band, at least one of the members of Queen would have one, but I didn't see one in the Bohemian Rhapsody trailer, not to mention the trailers for Aquaman or Roma. Well, if I'm not 100% sure, I'm just going to watch some TacStorm demo videos online. At least I know they won't let me down.",Back to the Future
