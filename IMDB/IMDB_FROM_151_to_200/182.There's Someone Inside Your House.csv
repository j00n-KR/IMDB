0,kosmasp,Just the beginning,6,10 October 2021,"No pun intended ... well probably not. But one thing is for sure, this has quite the strong beginning. Which reminded me that many producers especially like if their movie has a strong start ... to get the viewers engaged and compelled to go along for the ride.The problem some of those movies face for me at times: they can never achieve that high they begin with. And while this remains violent and bloody throughout, it lacks the major reveal and a strong lead. The group we get is fine and the theme is really something the movie deserves respect for ... but it only carries the movie so far.So a decent effort overall with great effects ... and for some I would imagine a dissapointing ending. But there have been worse efforts.",There's Someone Inside Your House
1,Tweekums,Solid enough high school slasher movie,7,7 October 2021,"This slasher film is centred on the students of a high school in rural Nebraska. It opens with a member of the football team waking up to realise there is somebody in his house. He finds photographs documenting his homophobic assault on another player which lead him to a closet. Here he is attacked and killed by a masked assailant... the mask looking like his own face. Inevitably the next day the other students at the school are speculating who might have been behind the attack. Of course he isn't the last to die; soon after somebody who likes to show off their right on tolerance at school is exposed as a racist before being killed. Our protagonists are outsiders to some degree; Makani Young, a girl who changed her name and moved to Nebraska following an incident elsewhere; Darby, a transgender kid; and Zach Sandford, the son of an unpopular local business man to name just three. With it looking like the killer is targeting people with secrets everybody suddenly becomes keen to confess anything they might have done; whether or not it will save them is unknown.This is a decent enough edition to the high school slasher genre. I can't see it becoming a classic but it passed ninety minutes well enough. The basic plot was nothing new but it had some fun twists; I particularly liked the killer wearing a mask of their victim. At times I wasn't sure if the film was trying to push a moral agenda or mocking those who act right-on but will not tolerate any disagreement... perhaps it was just trying to tap into the debate without picking a side to avoid offending anybody. The identity of the killer isn't a huge surprise despite early attempts to set up other suspects. There are less killings than I expected although those that there are are quite bloody. The cast is solid enough. I'm not sure about the title given that much of the deadly action takes place outside the victims' houses; I can only assume this wasn't the case in the book. Overall I'd say this is worth checking out if you are a fan of the genre; you won't waste too much time even if you don't like it.",There's Someone Inside Your House
2,BandSAboutMovies,90s slasher style,4,25 September 2021,"Based on the book by Stephanie Perkins, this Patrick Brice-directed (Creep) film is exactly the kind of movie for people who wish that the 90s and early 00s slasher boom never ended. Seriously, this film has major vibes of I Know What You Did Last Summer and if that's a good thing for you, then this is exactly the kind of comfort food that you're going to absolutely devour.Makani Young has moved from Hawaii to Osborne, Nebraska - there's a secret as to why - to live with her grandmother and finish high school. Yet as the school year grows closer to graduation, the secrets of her classmates become fair game to a killer who exposes them and then murders them while wearing a 3D printed mask of his victim's face.Starting with an ankle slashing worthy of Pet Sematary, the film has some nice setpieces like a party where everyone reveals their shameful skeletons in an attempt to take away the power of the killer. Complicating things is that Makani's love interest just might be the killer.The intriguing thing is that the victims aren't the put-upon outcasts, but the popular kids, the ones who bullied everyone in their path. And the gimmick of each person worrying that their own face will soon come their way with murder in their eyes, well, that's a pretty great idea that's well-used by this film, which is not shy about showing off some violent kills.The writeup for Fantastic Fest said that this film is ""Smart, woke, but utterly cynical, these kids know the tropes they're operating within, aware of their particular chances of survival based on their race, sexuality, and socioeconomic status."" And I guess there are some audiences that will cheer that sentence. There are others that enjoyed Scream and will be excited to watch a film that has the same energy. And there are still others who will yawn and just put on The Prowler again.",There's Someone Inside Your House
3,Calicodreamin,Not horrible,5,8 October 2021,"Overall not that bad, the final villain was unexpected and kind of made sense. The slasher scenes worked well from a gore and aesthetic point of view.

6,jtindahouse,Decent slasher with a couple of twists to keep it unique,7,7 October 2021,"I found this fun little film on Netflix tonight. I'm a big fan of slasher/whodunnits. They don't get made very often anymore sadly, but I Iap them up when they do.The film has a decent enough opening scene which sets the tone for the film. Suspenseful and ultimately brutal, with a little twist thrown in to show the killer's MO. From there we meet all the characters/suspects and the film takes on quite a traditional slasher structure.There are a couple of twists to the tale I liked that make this film unique from others. The killer's mask being the character they are attacking worked for me. It's not as intimidating as say the Scream mask for example - few are - but it works in its own way. The other twist being the punishment for secrets being kept. I thought that was a very interesting plot device.A couple of flaws in the film I spotted were that too much happens during the daytime. It's very hard to have an intense slasher scene in daylight. It's just not as scary. Also there is a lull through the middle that just goes on a little too long. Otherwise though I had a good time with 'There's Someone Inside Your House' and it's one I would recommend. 7/10.",There's Someone Inside Your House
7,DarkVulcan29,It fails where Scream(1996) succeeded.,5,9 October 2021,"A killer goes after people who have dark secrets, I remember an episode of Supernatural(2005-2020) had a similar premise.It's not all terrible, but would not put in the classics section with Scream, at least in that movie the killer had a fearful presence that makes you feel like you not safe anywhere, but with this film I just didn't have that feeling with this killer, unlike Ghost face and Michael Myers.There are some kills that are alright but not clever. Some of the characters are okay, but had tough time getting invested in some of them. All in all a medium thriller at best.

11,arungeorge13,"The 90s slasher gets a 2021 update, but there's very little takeaway! [+50%]",5,6 October 2021,"I expected more out of this Netflix cancel-culture slasher especially with Henry Gayden (Shazam!) writing and Patrick Brice (Creep & Creep 2) directing. I'll keep this short: what disappointed me big time were the kills - the most important part of a slasher flick. They weren't particularly clever or inventive, just generic slice n' dice. On the other hand, the key characters do have some nuances; ones that help in effectively building that mystery even though it isn't the greatest guessing to begin with. The occasional wry humour is also on point, not contradicting with the film's overall tone. The utter lack of innovation in the film's title spills over to the way the script plays out as well, and that leaves There's Someone Inside Your House a perfectly middling affair. It doesn't bore you, but it certainly doesn't win you over either. Still yaay to diversity and inclusion, I guess? I dunno!",There's Someone Inside Your House

14,gianmarcoronconi,Not too bad but not good,5,9 October 2021,"Not too bad horror, with cute twists and a mundane but engaging storyline. A big flaw, however, is predictability, you know very well who the killer is from the first part because it is obvious, and even if the film tries to address you to other suspects it fails. Another flaw is the lack of in-depth analysis of the characters who are poorly characterized and kept too serious, they are all characterized by the few traits that make them distinct and are practically all stereotypes.",There's Someone Inside Your House
15,gedikreverdi,"Creepy masks, good kills but a bit too predictable script",6,8 October 2021,"The title is a bit misleading because it made me expect something along the lines of Hush and You're Next. It's definitely not a bad slasher but it plays it safe a bit too much. It has a lot of opportunities to become a very good slasher like the secret reveal party thrown at the big mansion by the super rich student, the corn maze and the super eerie house in the middle of nowhere in the opening scene and btw the opening scene was really good, I like how he woke up and it was already dark and he's confused. The kills were overall pretty good and my favorite was the one at the party: a closet and an air vent always make a good kill in a slasher.However towards the end it becomes a bit predictable with the main girl being saved from an almost certain death at her house while she's alone and the maze run is on fire before anyone gets killed in the maze with a super long chase scene. And the super rich guy's son turned out to be the killer just after he killed his own father in the maze field on fire.I definitely enjoyed watching this but it seems I'll have to keep waiting for another Scream.",There's Someone Inside Your House
16,IonicBreezeMachine,An above average slasher flick,6,9 October 2021,"In the farming community Osbourne, Nebraska a series of murders takes place wherein the killer will wear a mold of the victims of face while revealing their darkest secrets. Makani Young (Sydney Park) has recently relocated to Osbourne following a painful event in Hawaii. Now Makani and her friends must survive the killer's rampage.Adapted from the 2017 novel of the same name by Stephanie Perkins, development began in 2018 as a co-production between Netflix, Shawn Levy's 21 Laps, and James Wan's Atomic Monster. Screenwriter Henry Gayden, best known as writer of Earth to Echo and the critically acclaimed Shazam adaptation and its forthcoming sequel, adapted the novel with directing duties handled by Patrick Brice best known for the comic thriller Creep films made with co-writer/star Mark Duplass. The film is an enjoyable throwback to the likes of 80s slashers like Graduation Day or Prom Night and features the usual reliable production work associated with 21 Laps/Atomic Monster productions and also brings in Brice's signature off-kilter humor that characterizes his work.Much like many Slasher films from the 80s, There's Someone Inside Your House is a twisted morality play with the killer seeking to unearth the darkest secrets of their victims before they meet their grisly demise. While initially the victims are more brazenly unsympathetic, the killer eventually lowers his threshold with secrets ranging from pilfering painkillers to involuntary manslaughter where the ""punishment"" fits the crime less and less. Even the good guys who are opposite the white bred ""All American"" high school elites are shown to be fallible, often making broad assumptions on the scantest evidence presented. The movie incorporates 21st century technology well into its traditional framework with its weaponization of peoples' secret ""sins"" distributed widely and quickly shows is almost as terrifying as the killer itself. If there is anything that holds the movie back, it's the inevitable comparison that rises between it and this year's earlier Netflix slasher throwback Fear Street which was probably a bit more daring in the risks it took. It's probably not fair to compare There's Someone Inside Your House to Fear Street as Fear Street was trying to be a centuries spanning horror story with intricate lore while There's Someone Inside Your House's goals are more smaller scale. There's nothing wrong with that as it's a worthwhile exercise especially for anyone who likes bare basics slasher films of this ilk and strictly speaking it's probably the best example I've seen since Hell Fest.There's Someone Inside Your House doesn't reinvent the standard framework from which it's inspired, but it is a well made film with some good gore work, intense intrigue, and Brice's sense of humor that made his Creep films so distinguished. While it's over shadowed by other recent slasher entries, it's a decent run that I can say I enjoyed.",There's Someone Inside Your House

The characters are ok but it is lacking something... It adds nothing new to this genre. On the plus side some of the kills are pretty well executed!Having seen James Wan's name in the beginning credits, it got my hopes up for it to be sadly disappointing (like a horror tripe of the over use of jump scares). Moreover, James Wan does not direct this film much to its detriment! He has a great understanding of what the audience deserves & more often than not to deliver it.

It doesn't make much sense even if it was obvious.

There were instances when the film fell a little flat and it was a little too obvious who the killer was, which was a shame as they didn't manage to build up enough of a suspect list. And so even with a great idea, it turned into every other low budget teen horror film. By the end, it had turned into one big cliche. I have not read the book and therefore I cannot make comparisons as to if the movie followed the book or which was better.

30,gabriel_sanchez,Scream-wannabe with shallow motive,4,3 November 2021,"The small-town of Osborne, Nebraska, is being terrorized by a masked killer. His motives are unclear, but his modus operandis not: he makes his victims' secrets public before killing them.Makani is the main character and the plot and subplot center on her. She is friends with a stereotypical group that stands out as not belonging to the other stereotypical characters, like the football players and cheerleaders. The subplot is Makani hides a secret.This movie tries to pass in a moral statement that falls too flat for me. The main problem is that the characters are too stereotypical and the moral statement is more like someone pointing fingers and shouting non-stop. To sum things up, we repeatedly hear minorities are the first to blame, even though that is definitely what is not happening. The glimpse of an investigation we actually see is just one huge blank interview with everyone from Osborne High, no stereotypes to blame other than the Police as the ""naive dumb-os"".Makani and her friends speculate about who is the killer with no hard evidence other than being the ones that are actually pointing fingers, even though they constantly say ""blacks and gays are the first to blame."" As expected in a ""who's-done-it"" kind of movie, we are constantly led to believe the killer is exhibit-A.This movie pays homage to Scream (1996). The killer itself is very similar to the one in Scream, with the fine touch that he uses a mask with the face of the victim he is about to kill. Of course, the killer is the master of setting up deadly traps, eerie sceneries, and disappearance.In the end, I got the killer and the motive right. The motive is ok if you think about it, but the overall plan is stupid. Sometimes even the most elaborate of plans make sense, but this one just felt too unexplained. I don't think someone with the motive the killer had, and also the disturb the killer might have, would go into such an intricate plan to expose his victims even though, sometimes, their secrets were so out of place like ""he does drugs, duh...""Some holes are left open, but I filled them myself with some logical thinking.I don't think the movie is too bad, but I would not recommend it to anyone as a good movie.

The slasher genre is BACK,7,7 October 2021,"The plot of the movie was interesting, the characters were nice (the thing I like about 2020's horror slasher movies characters, is that they all differ from each other). The killer's mask was so innovative and cool. I have to admit that it was a basic slasher film, because you could predict what would happen or who would die, even though, it was enjoyable. The kills were perfect for a slasher movie (so bloody and gory). However, the killcount was kinda low (I expected way bigger death count), at least the kills were nice. The ending was predictable (not the killer, just the ending). In my opinion, it was just a nice slaher film, nothing new, just entertaining. The duration of the movie was, as it should be.

First we tolerate this cheesy blood shed and horror screen, then we tolerate some cheesy lines from the teenagers, then we see the usual school, then the speeches trying to move us, then we tolerate seeing the rich or cool kids or mean girls and the ridiculousness that is the wardrobe and makeup of characters whereby they try getting us to feel attached to the characters/protagonists that never works, then they're chased by some stone faced weirdo most likely who's motives don't justify his rampage. They always imagine what we're seeing will be better than the others. Until your left feeling utterly robbed of your ninety minutes and the actors scratch their head as to what went wrong. Repetitive, predictable, cheesy let down.",There's Someone Inside Your House

They didn't do anything memorable, except for a bad ending. Torn between 4-5/10I thought the beginning of ""There's Someone Inside Your House"" was pretty good. They set up a pretty fun teen-scream slasher and I thought I'd be giving it a 6-7. They did some great stuff with the killer's mask. Production quality, acting, and casting were all pretty good too.However, around the middle it really started to fall apart. The killer's motivations were a little muddier, and the scenes were less believable. Without giving spoilers, there was a lot of weird unbelievable reactions when people spot the killer for most of the movie.I pegged the reveal pretty early on, and they didn't do any kind of twist to make it more interesting when they finally show who it is. Even the people I was watching it with who weren't sure who it was going to be found it lackluster.The end itself is pretty nonsensical. Once again the motivations seem to shift pretty hard, it escalates in a strange way compared to the way things had been going, and the main characters make some poor decisions (not the fun horror trope kind)",There's Someone Inside Your House

60,guskeller,Its substance is a mirage,5,18 October 2021,"There's Someone Inside Your House is like the teenagers it targets: cool and hip, but lacking mature depth. The film introduces interesting topics (gender fluidity, substance abuse, and xenophobia) but doesn't explore them. Meanwhile, the actual focuses of the story are glossed over and resolved as quickly as they are revealed. For a script that includes conflicts of all kinds, There's Someone Inside Your House is surprisingly cushy. Consequently, because conflicts aren't examined, the movie isn't about anything. Its substance is a mirage.This extends to the filmmaking as well. While There's Someone Inside Your House looks slick and employs craft, it doesn't serve any greater meaning. It is trendy for the sake of being trendy. A great example of this is the soundtrack. In a vacuum, the music is enjoyable and sets a somber, stylish tone. However, it is just capitalizing on what is currently popular and fails to highlight anything of relevance from the story. This notion also applies to the cinematography and editing of There's Someone Inside Your House. On the surface, there is effort put into these aspects of the film, yet it is nothing more than flashy indulgence. This is perfectly fine, but many viewers will find the experience lacking.Writing: 3/10

Then drama kicks in and the story gets worse. The cast really tried to breathe life into the play but at some point I lost interest in all the characters. It's only Sydney Park as Makani Young who delivers a cheerful performance as the lead. Other peeps like the ladyboy/boylady are annoying and the usual weed party just tells us we are dealing with a wasted generation.This film serves a Halloween party if you're drunk and rather chat with your friends while the Netflix movie flickers on your LED screen.

And that is probably the films biggest crime - That, and the films awful ending.I also feel this film was strange in it's atmosphere. Has this emotive ambient score that felt odd for a slasher flick, I'm not sure it even wants to be a slasher/horror film.

65,adotson-98233,A derivative but above average slasher fare,5,8 October 2021,"""There's Someone Inside Your House"" is a very derivative slasher that feels like other horror movies. But yet still has a decent idea for it to maybe work.Let me start off with what I liked. This movies acting isn't actually that bad. Each character gives okay to at times good performances. I also liked that this movie tried at least to give some characters some backstory. It's flawed, but they still tried. Also the movie is pretty gory. It's got some nice kills in it. And the movie also has some decent set pieces. And finally I appreciate how the movie tries to do something interesting with a slasher. I do like the idea, and it could've worked. That is if it were in a better written movie.And now the negatives. This movie is a mess. It's a very uneven movie with some awkward pacing. The movie does steal a lot of things from other horror movies. The opening is very reminiscent of ""Scream"". And the characters make really dumb choices. And example is someone hanging up the phone when they call 9-1-1. Or a character running in a closet instead of the front door. There's a lot of decisions like that and it's very underwhelming. And finally the final set piece was very disappointing. It could've been very exciting and cool, but it kinda just ended. Also the killer was a little obvious.Overall ""There's Someone Inside Your House"" is a movie that suffers from a messy story, being derivative, and awkward pacing. But it does have a likable cast, some good set pieces, and just enough good gore for me to say that it's not terrible, but far from good.",There's Someone Inside Your House

Why? It's not that he did something bad.And super easy to just guess who was the killer. Really. 3D printing machine is expensive and there was only one kid who was rich enough to have it.There you go.And again, when the killer entered the house, why everyone just ran away? It's not that he had a machine gun. He just walked in casually. A room full of people, football players, big muscular guys, but not single one of them trying to tackle him.Come on..The girl locked her room w a chair and kinda difficult to open. But nope. It's super easy. Not even making a sound to wake her up. Magic.Oke one more, the killer just walked to a corn festival with a sword, people didnt even bat an eye.Come on.

70,romneyranjo,Good start & high school slasher,7,17 October 2021,"To keep it short, the movie ISN'T BAD.It had a great beginning. The story, including the killer and his methods, was well-established. Might I add that the gore-level is in a justiafably satisying level where you don't feel SICK watching it, yet weirded out that you're enjoying the blood. So it's not HOSTEL gore but definitely not PROM NIGHT (2008) high-school-simple stab kinda gore.Well-developed CHARACTERS. The unique part about this movie is that for a Netflix film, the characters are pretty good. Some victims made last minute bad decisions but not entirely stupid. Unlike with your typical teen slashers, the characters' decisions are pretty understandable given the situation + their youth.The TWIST is OKAY.As someone who's seen almost every plot twist in the horror genre book, I think this one had a decent reveal. *I WON'T SPOIL WHO IT IS SO U CAN KEEP READING* Did I guess, correctly? YES. Did I know from the start? Sort of. I had 2-3 options. Anyway, the cool part is the movie doesn't aim to be UNIQUE with its killer or reveal. They simply wanted it to be logical (minus the actual possibility of getting away with the kills in the first place)OKAY - So what's not to enjoy in the film?The PACING. It starts off REALLY amazing. I love a horror movie that gives you multiple bodycount in the first 30-40 minutes. And that, it did. But as the film tries to uncover more about the ""FINAL GIRL"", the story becomes less interesting. I'm not sure if it's just me. But a big part of me ****SEMI-SPOILER COMING AHEAD**** wanted the herione to die. I felt like the way she moved she knew she was going to make it.And then, the latter and climax part also lacked the heat *if you've seen it, you'll get the pun*. It was just... Okay. I wanted to see running and screaming!! But what were we given? A jaxtaposition of the main girl's backstory.I feel like it's good but could've been better if they kept that pacing from start to end. My heart was raising and I was cheering ""KILL KILL KILL"" or ""RUN RUN RUN"" at the start. And then I found myself going through my phone at the end.FINAL NOTE:

But it also has nothing to do with the events of the movie except maybe a few moments from the opening.There are also too many characters and too much story jammed into 90 minutes. Most of which we could care less about. And not enough time to dig very deep into any of them. Why movie makers try to cram so much into a short movie is beyond me. I don't care that it was based on a book or comic or whatever. Just single out a night or two, a small group of people or a much smaller setting. The best horror/scary movies do it this way.

84,AliMO_,Bad acting and execution,1,12 October 2021,"The story stated off pretty good the acting was just bad from start to finish the idea was pretty good but they didn't execute it right. They never really had a solid main theme. Even in one scene where a char says The decetieve in the class is a racist and is only looking for black peoples as a victim but he was literally interrogating everyone(excluding his brother I think) Then just how unrealistic the killer gets away everytime. The police either just don't got enough workers or they are just getting the wrong information. The killers second kill made the least sense. The girl was on the phone with the person she originally intended to go to the church with. So she realizes the one with her right now isn't him. But she decides to hang up on the phone ? Instead of telling the dude she's in danger and to call 911. Why didn't she bother to call 911 right then and there ? She tries to explain to a guy wearing a mask with a knife in a empty church that her video (Her secret which is why the killer kills people ) was satire ? But she finally decides to call 911 after she gets stabbed but then it's too late. Not to mention while this is going on there is people outside the church Tryna get in waiting for someone with a key to come open it. But they someone don't see the killer walk out ? Or don't hear the girl screams. Then the main character backstory was such a letdown i mean she was forced to push a girl in fire by a high school Varsity cheerleader. It can't get more childish then that but wait. The killers reveal was someone in the friend group which was kind of made obvious because that same friend made a secret party. His dialogue was just cringe and you won't believe his reasoning it's because he was privileged ? His idealogy legit doesn't fit his char at all he talks about people not showing them true selves,How is him being privileged make him form that idealogy? I can also go more on how bad the side cast was I legit never seen such a bad side cast before. But like I said the way the killer kept getting away was so dumb. It's like the cops in the show don't exist. Overall 1/10 I liked the plot in the beginning but acting wasn't it and story kept getting worse and worse and antagonist was just done bad. It could have been better if they fixed his dialogue at his reveal and given him a better reveal.",There's Someone Inside Your House
85,AliMO_,Bad acting and execution,1,12 October 2021,"The acting was just bad from start to finish the friend group was just even worse the story started off good but the acting was bad .The friend group is a wannabe be ""Woke"" group But all the did was just use Stereotypes that had no correlation for example one of friends in the group said the police sheriff was the one behind the crime and wants to blame it on a black person was he can keep his job. But this literally makes no sense cause they were interviewing even white people and not just certain races. Like they all interviewed them at the same tone .This is also what I mean by bad execution. They really didn't have a main theme they wanted to portray so they added nonsense just to have it I guess. Then it's just how unrealistic the way the killer gets away. I'm thinking a fourth grader wrote this book I mean are cameras not a thing and are there not enough police officers this man was literally in a school and killed someone and somehow got away ? Keep in mind this school was know to have the killer in it .You would think the cameras would catch him. But this isn't even the worse part in his second victim .He pretends to be someone this girl originally intend to go to a church with. But once she finds out while she's on the phone with the dude she originally wanted to go with she hangs up on him while a dude in a mask with a knife in her hand is standing in front of her. Why didn't she tell him to call the cops or why didn't she call them him self instead she try's to tell the killer her video was satire (The video was her secret the killer idealogy was to expose them and kill them)She then finally decides to call 911 after she was stabbed but that obviously doesn't turn out great. But the worst of the worst was the killer reveal. He was someone in the ""woke "" friend group who had actually made a secret party before his reveal. Which make it kind of obvious it was him. But when he was revealed this man had the worse dialogue I seen in a antagonist. His reasoning also made zero sense talking about wanting to reveal people's mask and he did this because he was privileged ? Him killing people legit contradicts his reasoning tho. The dude was legit a wannabe joker with is dialogue he sounded too hard to sound woke but really he was just a privileged kid. Who's made cause he has it all? Like I generally don't get this reasoning but yeah bad execution bad acting which caused every character to be bland.

86,marie-ell1993,More Thriller than horror,5,6 October 2021,"Unlike some horror/thriller movies that have a slow build up to the first murder, this went for the jugular from the offset.Sydney Park played her role well as one of the main characters.You're not going to see anything that hasn't been done a hundred times, nothing unique and after 35 minutes I had an incline as to who the culprit was.There are scenes that were unbelievable and not wouldn't, but couldn't have happened without the character waking up. Most notably when Sydney put a chair behind her door. Don't want to give anything away. The build up to the action was minimal and predictable. There wasn't any jump scares and I would class this to be more of a thriller than horror.If you want to pass a bit of time away with a film that you can have on in the background and not miss anything, but still watchable, then I'd give it a go.

The way she treats the guy she uses for sex/drugs (he's actually a nice person) is abhorrent which makes it nearly impossible to root for her to survive.Again, not the worst slasher ever but the 10 out of 10 stars ratings (i'd bet all from the same person) are fake.

The characters were all humanized and had more dimensions in the book.

I thought it was good.It's a bit reminiscent of Scream, but probably only because it's a slasher flick featuring teens in high school.Aside from that, the cast were all good actors, the script was good, and the story was believable.What more can you ask for these days? Is it 100% original? Nothing is. The best we can hope for is for the story to be done in some way that is different and sets it apart from the rest.I only knocked off a couple of points because the ending just seemed to me to be easy, and a bit too tightly wrapped up. It was just over. But that's just my humble opinion.All things have to end, and sometimes the ending isn't long and drawn out and super suspenseful, I guess.All said, it had some tense scenes, some humor, and kept me interested. Better than a lot of the stuff that's been coming out lately.Bottom line: Ignore the far-right, anti-woke reviews from idiots who use terms like SJW. They're going to hate on anything that comes out these days, because they can't stand to see LGBTQ+ (which I don't think this movie focused or harped on in any way.

151,itsaviraes,"Missed Opportunity, but still watchable",5,14 October 2021,"It's okay. Not anything great but I don't think it's downright terrible for a slasher. Sure, it's a mess, but it's a fun one that makes it clear it doesn't take itself too seriously aside from social commentary and isn't trying to be anything it's not, which I appreciate. The frustrating thing though, is that it absolutely could've been great, it just never lived up to its potential at all. I really think this should've been a series.Cons: There's a plethora of plotholes and issues with the narrative. Rodrigo's death is the one I have a main issue with, especially since he was one of the few characters I was genuinely intrigued by. It literally made no sense and doesn't compare to the others' secrets. Several of the reactions to spotting the killer don't make sense, which I guess a recurring thing in a lot in slashers, even the ones considered classics, but it's still not a good thing. The pacing in this film was way too fast, which made some important context and backstory feel like it was being glossed over or skipped. Again, this really would've been better off as a series. The killers reveal was rushed, underwhelming and the ending was predictable. Zach was a weak villain overall. Plus their reasoning and explanation was convoluted. It felt like conflicts were resolved way too quickly. Character development could've been far better, the vast majority of them feel like run of the mill stereotypes because they were not explored properly. The same can go for several of the themes which sucks because they had really good ones conceptually.Pros: Lots of people harping on the script, I thought it was fine. It fit the characters well. The actors did a good job with it. Great cinematography and music. The set pieces were solid as well. There's a dash of campy satire and the movie is self aware of what it is without breaking the 4th wall which is a nice touch. It's very 90's-esque without blatant pandering for nostalgia points. The opening sequence was captivating. It's a strong premise for a slasher which I'll dive more into later. Characters are at least likeable. The movie has a Good Final Girl, and a subversion of some of the tropes associated with it. The idea of the killer wearing the future victim's faces and how it fits in with the movies themes of so called ""cancel culture"" and repression is a neat idea for this subgenre. I liked the self-aware commentary about tokenism and virtue-signaling, which was another prominent theme in this movie. Back to this concept of cancel culture, it was cool how they took this and incorporated it with the kind of ""justice fantasy"" element that pertains to slasher characters. These secrets the characters are hiding are weaponized by the killer and exposed right before or after their death in order to give the characters mixed reactions, some of which resemble real-life attitudes on the subject. The way the killer uses these secrets against people in order to prop themselves up and rid themselves of the accountability they believe they're forcing others to face, specifically in a time where younger people are more keen on communicating about these issues with their peers does set itself apart from other movies in this genre overall and I wish they did more than they did with this topic. It's a fun watch if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy something. Despite all the pitfalls I did still enjoy it for what it is; a campy, mess of a slasher.I think a 5-5.5 overall score is absolutely a fair rating, factoring in both premise, writing, and personal enjoyment. No classic by any means, but it's definitely not completely unwatchable as some people are acting like. It's definitely an easy watch for teenagers or those unfamiliar with the genre.",There's Someone Inside Your House

175,aayushs-53466,Dazzling slasher film for new generation,7,6 October 2021,"After the massive success of the recently released 'Fear Street' trilogy, Netflix has once again treated the young adult audiences with a perfectly-timed slasher film titled 'There's Someone Inside Your House'. The movie, based on the novel of the same name written by Stephanie Perkins, revolves around a young woman named Makani Young (Sydney Park) who has recently shifted to a small town in Nebraska to complete her studies and change her life. She has a group of friends that is really supportive. However, everything changes when a serial killer starts killing the students of Osborne High School and starts exposing their dark secrets to the whole town.The premise of the Netflix horror flick seems to be taking inspiration from slasher movies from the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, mixing the inspired stuff with the sensibilities of today's youth gives viewers an amazing slasher film for the upcoming Halloween season.The movie starts with an epic killing sequence that perfectly sets the tone. A popular high-school footballer named Jackson is alone in the house when he realizes that someone is inside his house. As soon as he thinks of leaving the house, he realizes his car is gone and he is forced to get back inside the house. Surprisingly, the intruder knows about Jackson's dark secret and has photos of him brutally beating the hell out of a student named Caleb because he was gay. He enters the wardrobe and gets attacked by a knife just a little above his toes. Jackson is terrified to know that the killer is actually wearing a mask of his own face.As the film moves forward, we get to realize that Makani is facing her own demons as well and is being haunted by that one thing she did in her past. Meanwhile, the killer is getting bolder day after day and kills another student named Katie (Sarah) for running an anonymous podcast which makes us realize how racist she actually is. The gang gets really worried and plans to unearth the truth in this well-crafted and thoroughly entertaining young adult movie.The film's strength lies in its characters and filmmaker Patrick Brice, along with writer Henry Gayden, have done a fantastic job in creating characters who are fighting their inner demons to stay relevant in society. Getting stalked by a killer is terrifying, but being haunted by something that you did in the past is much more horrifying than anything else. This is the kind of fear Makani lives with daily. One more thing that the movie does differently is how the serial killer finds its victims.Slasher movies in the 2000s always introduced us to a group of friends getting killed one by one, but the Netflix movie has done something different here by presenting us with a killer who is brutally murdering students who have a dirty secret hidden.As far as acting is concerned, Sydney Park gives an amazing performance as Makani. During the course of the movie, Park shows why Makani turned out the way she is and knocks it out of the park with a somber performance. I hope, we get to see more of her in the future. The supporting cast is amazing as well, especially Whibley. The actor, who plays Zach in the movie, is a mysterious guy who hates his dad for doing some really wrong things. Meanwhile, Cooper, Josef, LaTourette, and Theodore Pellerin (Oliver) have given superb performances that will surely be remembered in the coming years.Director Patrick Brice has done a phenomenal job in creating a movie that is elevated by strong acting and authentic story progression. Whenever a character dies, the movie just simply does not move on and allows the sadness to sink in before moving onto the net part of the story. A lot of people might not label it as a horror movie, but that's not something that viewers should worry about because the film will keep them at the edge of their seats due to its writing and how gruesomely the victims are killed.'There's Someone Inside Your House' is a worthy addition to the sub-genre and explores its characters more than any other slasher movie has done in the past. Of all the horror movies that Netflix has offered in the recent past, this is undoubtedly one of the best so far.",There's Someone Inside Your House

Imagine if in the Vietnam war the vets stopped to tell the Viet his life story before killing him? He'd be dead and the Vietnamese might have won the war. Now what I'm saying is Zach had a katana which is obviously way bigger than the knife she was carrying, he had the advantage. He should have killed her on the spot then proceeded to finish off Ollie.

Some elements like the mc's poems i thought were really nice but the dialogue and fake deep ness was just really off putting.

Is that what we're going with?Moving onto the fourth girl, who was a victim of hazing which 1) she's 14 or 15 years old and on a swim team? Gymnastics? I know they don't call it gym-nice-tics but this level of hazing seems unbelievable for high school girls in Hawaii. And 2) the girl who accidentally injuries someone is convicted of a crime but not the girls doing the hazing or the person who supplied alcohol to teenagers? When she finally tells her friends the ""secret"" not one of them acknowledges that she was also a victim.And the privileged white boy with daddy issues being the murderer...if I roll my eyes any more they'll fall out of my head.

186,catherinej-74820,Impressive,8,21 October 2021,"The horror movie There's Someone Inside Your House, just released On Netflix October 6th. The initial release date was September 23, 2021 at Fantastic Fest. This film is an adaptation of Stephanie Perkin's novel, There's Someone in Your House and was written by Henry Gayden (Shazam!). The film is directed by Patrick Brice, known for the horror films titled Creep and Creep 2. The maturity rating: substances, language, violence, gore, and for mature audiences. The cinematography is by Jeff Cutter. Shawn Levy's 21 Laps and James Wan's Atomic Monster are producing the film. Wan stated that he wanted to do more of a traditional 80's slasher with this film. A sequel is in the work for the film.Makani and her friends at Osborne High School try to identify and stop a masked killer who's targeting students and exposing their biggest secrets. The whole film is fixated on Makani Young, who is new to the small town after moving from Hawaii to live with her grandmother. Makani has a past that keeps hunting her. The horror film is full of blood and drugs, with even some Nazi stuff thrown in there. The film opened with its first kill, surprisingly it was not a main character. Football player Jackson was stalked around his empty home. The killer then notifies the entire town to Jackson's secret, which is that he bullied his teammate Carter, who was gay. A second victim named Katie, who was student council president, was found. The killer strung her body above the church's altar. This put every Osborne High student with a secret at risk, especially Makani, who moved to Nebraska to escape her own scandal and was constantly worried that the killer had unearthed her true identity. The film's conclusion was impressive. The killer was revealed in a surprising twist, which started off at the corn field where all the students were at that night. The killer set the whole corn field on fire, while Makani and her friends tried to stop him. After the killer was revealed, Makani took measure into her own hands and stabbed the killer. The film overall was impressive in the beginning as well as the ending.Sydney Park plays Makani Young, the central character. Makani is a transfer student and is a target of the killer because she harbors a shameful secret. Park starred as Cyndie in The Walking Dead, as Winter in Santa Clarita Diet, and many other films/series. Asjha Cooper portrays Alex, one of Makani's friends who isn't afraid to voice her mind. Cooper recently starred in the Amazon's Welcome to Blumhouse horror flick Black as Night, playing the role of Shawna. Theodor Pellerin plays Ollie, Makani's summer boyfriend and prime suspect in the town's murders. Pellerin starred in On Becoming God in central Florida. Dale Whibley is Zach Sanford, son of a local (and hated) businessman who is trying to buy the lands of its denizens. Whibley recently starred in Big Shot, the Disney + series. Jesse Latourette as Darby, Burkley Duffield as Celeb Greeley, and Diego Josef as Rodrigo Doran. There seems to be controversy in the film regrading racism and politics.
