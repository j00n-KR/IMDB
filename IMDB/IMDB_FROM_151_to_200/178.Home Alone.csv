0,TheLittleSongbird,Wonderful!,9,5 May 2009,"I absolutely love the first two Home Alone movies, the third one is adequate but the fourth movie is just dreadful and makes me vomit because of what it did to two underrated gems and a little -below-average follow up. Macaulay Culkin is wonderful as Kevin. In this and Home Alone 2, which is my personal favourite, he is cute and self-assured. Alex D Linz gives a spirited performance in Home Alone 3, but Michael Weinburg just doesn't do anything with the script(which was terrible), other than whine in the fourth film. Anyway back to Home Alone. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the film, with their goofiness and charm that was evidently missed in the last two instalments. Matching them, is the late great John Candy, and here he is wonderful. Candy has starred in movies like Uncle Buck and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, both of which are hilarious. Home Alone just broadens the comedic talent, that Candy certainly had. The film looks beautiful, with very good direction, and best of all great visual jokes and traps, as well as a fun and sometimes touching script. My problem is why is the rating for both Home Alone and Home 2 so low, when almost everyone I know consider them as holiday classics? All in all, a funny, touching and underrated film, that could have been a little shorter(only by one or two minutes). 9/10 Bethany Cox",Home Alone
1,Leofwine_draca,The near-perfect American family film,9,25 December 2015,"I saw and loved HOME ALONE as a kid, particularly enjoying all the 'home invasion' traps that Kevin McCallister set up for the bad guys. Watching it nowadays, I'm surprised to see that this sequence only takes up the last quarter of the movie; before then there's a surprisingly complex storyline with some good sub-plots to keep it moving nicely along.That this also turns out to be a classic film which has lost none of its warmth and magic is the biggest surprise. Yes, Macaulay Culkin is more than a little annoying when you watch him as an adult - in fact, I remember him being annoying when I watched him as a kid - but you can forgive him because he's endearing nonetheless. Of the supporting cast, the ones who particularly shine are Joe Pesci (channelling some of that GOODFELLAS energy), Daniel Stern, and Roberts Blossom (DERANGED).The film was written by John Hughes, so the expected sentimentality is here, but somehow it never becomes too cloying - you can live with it, because there's plenty of good stuff elsewhere. That home invasion stuff is still superbly directed, surprisingly violent, and very funny, and there's so much ingenuity packed into the running time that this is a film impossible to dislike. In fact, I still love it.",Home Alone
2,SnoopyStyle,Back when Macaulay Culkin was the cutest ever,7,30 November 2013,"Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is the youngest of a large family. They are preparing to go to Paris for Christmas. The power goes out overnight, and none of the clocks work. The family rushes to get on the plane and leave little Kevin behind. The Wet Bandits, Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), come to town to rob the McCallister home only to battle Kevin and his home made traps.Director Chris Columbus and writer John Hughes team up to create one of the most iconic comedies of its era. It's in no small part due to the iconic scene of Macaulay Culkin slapping his face and Scream. Take it away, it's a rather crass juvenile kiddie movie. I'm not complaining, just explaining. Expect a lot of slapstick stupidity with the annoying Wet Bandits.",Home Alone
3,Hitchcoc,Just for Fun,8,2 January 2015,"My response to this movie is strictly prejudiced. For all it violence and lack of verisimilitude, I get a kick out it ever time I see it. If one can't get past the fact that the Wile E. Coyote element is in here (where no one ever seems to get hurt, no matter what), you aren't going to have much fun. With that caveat, the movie is a bit of a hoot. McCauley Culkin came to stardom in this (it's too bad his life became unsettled after this). Watching Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the ever optimistic though doomed villains, continue to fight a losing cause against an eight year old is the stuff cartoons are made of. Their mugging as they try one thing after another, only to be thwarted, is great fun. The subplot of the mother hooking up with a polka band, led by the inimitable John Candy, adds an element of joy. There is also the relationship that grows with a frightening man next door who has been tabbed a murderer by the insensitivity of the neighborhood kids. This man is estranged from his son and has lapsed into a sad existence. This raises this up from just a kid movie to one with a bit more substance. Anyway, don't take it to seriously and one may have a bit of fun at the holidays.",Home Alone
4,Horst_In_Translation,One for the holidays,6,30 December 2014,"This year it is already 24 years ago that Chris Columbus' ""Home Alone"" starring Macaulay Culkin was released and the film gets shown pretty much every holiday season here. It also scored 2 Academy Award nominations, probably mostly because it was by far the most commercially successful movie in the United States in 1990. Of course, that is also why so far there have been three sequels, with only the second starring the lead actor and most of the original cast in ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"". Columbus directed this sequel as well and later worked on ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and several ""Harry Potter"" films.One of the strengths of ""Home Alone"" is that also all the smaller characters bring quite some charm and fun. Kevin's uncle (especially during his scenes in the plane) is my favorite smaller funny character and Old Man Marley brings the emotional highlights here. That church scene was particularly wonderful. What a shame the actor is not alive anymore. Same goes for the film's writer John Hughes and John Candy, who both died way too early. Mentioning John Hughes, I was a bit surprised that the smoking Santa was not him in a small role. He exactly looked that way. You may have seen some of Hughes' other very known works such as ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""101 Dalmatians"" and many more.Another mention goes out to Joe Pesci, who has had a true career year in 1990. Here he plays the chubby, slightly smarter villain (over Daniel Stern's character) compared to his completely sinister mafiosi gangster turn in ""Goodfellas"", which won him the Oscar that year. Culkin was nominated for a Golden Globe in the musical/comedy actor category, but lost to Gerard Depardieu, who won for the only movie from all the nominees which is not considered a classic or close to that description today.""Home Alone"" runs for roughly 100 minutes and will make you laugh a lot and also touch you. The latter happened for me mostly with the old man with the snow shovel and how meeting Kevin impacts his life. My favorite funny scene was the gangster film playing with the poor pizza guy coming along. I saw it so often already, but it never fails to crack me up. I am not sure if I would call this movie a classic or even an epic, but it is certainly worth a watch. Recommended.",Home Alone
5,gavin6942,A Hughes-Columbus Christmas Classic,7,25 December 2006,"After being accidentally left home alone by his family, Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) must defend his residence from the Wet Bandits (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci), who are for some reason obsessed with the idea of hurting the little boy and stealing useless knick-knacks.This film is a legend and a classic. Released in 1990, it captures both the more serious 1990s with the fun 1980s. Two 1980s masters come together to film this one: John Hughes as writer (""Sixteen Candles"", ""Pretty in Pink"", ""The Breakfast Club"") and Chris Columbus as director (""Adventures in Babysitting""). This makes for the perfect blend in young adult situation comedy.This is the film that launched Macaulay Culkin's career. While he had previously appeared in ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Uncle Buck"", this was (and remains) his biggest and most cherished role. I would find it safe to say no film since has really captured the essence of Macaulay. While ""Saved"" and ""Party Monster"" are both (possibly) equally as good movies, they do not have the mass appeal of ""Home Alone"".What is best about the film is its sense of fun. The plot really makes little sense. How does a family not notice they have an extra plane ticket or that a sibling is missing? Why would burglars break into a house where they can be identified? How can Joe Pesci get beat up relentlessly and not curse once? Is it possible to not have a single friend, family member or neighbor in all of Chicago? The ""Scream"" joke was used too much (four times). At least one, and probably two, instances could have been removed. Do we need to see a little boy twice getting burned by aftershave? Of course not. The repeated use of the ""keep the change you filthy animal"" joke seemed to work very well, though, strangely enough.Overall, this is a great Christmas movie. Along with ""Die Hard"" this is one you really need to make sure you watch around the holidays, at least once. If you have never seen ""Home Alone"" you are one of five people on earth or something... it was a huge success. With good reason. So see it.",Home Alone
6,lee_eisenberg,Why Daniel Stern preferred this one to the sequel.,5,16 January 2006,"When I heard Daniel Stern speak at Lewis & Clark College in September, 2004, about his USO tour in Iraq, he said that while ""Home Alone"" had a bunch of silly gags, at least it only had them once; the sequel just repeated everything. When you think about it, that makes sense. This movie was funny the first time (I certainly loved it when I saw it in the theaters), but not much after that. I gotta ask: what happened to John Hughes? In the '80s, he made movies like ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles""; in the '90s, he got into dropping things on people's heads (think ""Home Alone"" and ""Baby's Day Out""). Oh well, life goes on. And for the record, Daniel Stern also said that when he was in Iraq, some Iraqi children recognized him from this movie; that made him understand the reach of American culture.",Home Alone
7,jboothmillard,Home Alone,8,20 June 2005,"If you like a really good family film at Christmas, then there's a big difference, there is no family in this film (or at least for most of it). The McCallister family are preparing a Christmas holiday to Paris. The night before they leave the youngest child of the family causes trouble and is sent to bed early. He wishes that the family would disappear. The next morning, the family leave and realise when they are in Paris that they have forgot one thing, Kevin (Golden Globe nominated Macaulay Culkin)! Kevin now has all the fun that he wants. Only problem is that two crooks Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) are trying to get into the large house to loot it. This is just wonderful for goofy live action gags, kids entertainment and Christmas fun. Also starring John Heard as Peter McCallister, Roberts Blossom as Marley and Catherine O'Hara as Kate McCallister. It was nominated for the Oscars for Best Music for John Williams and Best Song for ""Somewhere in My Memory"", it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. It was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. Very good!",Home Alone
8,ccthemovieman-1,That Face Helped Make This A Big Hit,8,3 October 2006,"This an absurd storyline. Hollywood loves to show movies in which kids are smarter than adults, for some reason. Also, we are expected to believe a big family can go all the way to the airport and then fly to France before finding out one of their kids was left at home??! I don't think so. I know a lot of big families and this would never-in-a-million years happen.However, it's just a movie, and it isn't real and you can't take any of it seriously. Thus, the idea is to go along with the wild premise and enjoy the antics that follow....and there are plenty of those!A share of the credit for the big success of this film should go to God, who made Maccaulay Culkin's face. Without it, I doubt this would have been anywhere near the hit is was, but Culkin's ""cuteness"" helps makes you root for him and his facial expressions provide a lot of laughs. He turned out to be a fine child actor.The two guys (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) that play incompetent crooks are funny and some of the humor is clever, although slapstick ""rules"" in this film.There are some really nice messages in here, such as ""families suck,"" says the kid. Oh, well, some think this film did, too. I am not a big fan of it, but I did enjoy it along with most other people. I thought the sequel was better, though.",Home Alone
9,Tweekums,Anarchic Family Fun,9,6 June 2012,"The night before eight year old Kevin and his family are due to depart for their Christmas holidays in Paris he misbehaves and is sent to bed early; feeling hard done by he wishes they would disappear. In the morning events conspire to cause a rushed departure and Kevin is accidentally left behind in the panic; when he wakes up his wish has come true! His parents meanwhile have discovered their mistake and are struggling desperately to find a way to get back to Chicago. With nobody to look after him Kevin quickly learns to look after himself. Meanwhile Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars, are robbing houses in the area and the one they consider the best target is Kevin's; he will have to be extra smart if he is to prevent a robbery. On the first night he tricks them into believing there is a party on but he won't be so lucky the next time but the neither will Harry and Marv; by the time they return Kevin has prepared an interesting welcome for them; one that will leave them bleeding, burnt, bruised and battered!When I first watched this film over twenty years ago I was surprised just how much I laughed and watching it again now it is just as funny; the early part of the film has a decent number of laughs but later on when the attempted burglary takes place it is hysterically funny in a slightly malicious way; Harry and Marv may be unpleasant criminals but I'm not sure anybody deserves what happens to them! Young Macaulay Culkin does a great job as Kevin; he really managed to carry the film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were also entertaining as the two burglars. While it is primarily a comedy there are some touching moments; most notably when Kevin talks to the scary neighbour and learns that he hasn't spoken to his son for years because of a silly argument. Overall I'd say this is a great film that can be enjoyed by young and old alike; definitely one to watch!",Home Alone
10,moonspinner55,"""Maybe the kid will let us in."" .. ""He's a kid. Kids are stupid.""",5,19 July 2015,"""Home Alone"", directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by '80s golden boy John Hughes, has pleased millions of people, and is a not-unintentional holiday perennial as well, taking place as it does during the Christmas season. It is a film that operates at a level at which any sort of professional criticism is no longer helpful. Youngster is (improbably) left behind after his large family packs up and leaves for the airport to vacation in Paris; he fends off two inept burglars while mom makes her way back home. Macaulay Culkin plays the main character, Kevin, but there really is no character; Culkin succeeds in the role strictly by playing up his inherent precociousness--most often directly to the camera--while we admire his spunk and resourcefulness (both unrealistic for easy laughs). The picture looks immaculate, sparkly and shined to a fare-thee-well. Often times, just the reassurance that what we're watching is a big, expensive bauble made solely for our enjoyment is enough to keep the masses happy. The holiday trimmings trigger nostalgia in adults and joy for children, while the thieves (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, both over-the-top) aren't scary, mean or nasty--just lovable, irascible losers who can't topple our pint-sized hero no matter how hard they try...and oh how the audience wants them to keep trying! Followed by two sequels in 1992 and 1997. ** from ****",Home Alone
11,blanche-2,Fun Christmas film,8,27 December 2009,"A little boy ends up ""Home Alone"" when his family leaves for Paris without him in this 1990 film starring Macauley Culkin, Catherine O'Hara, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The family is running late and nearly misses a flight to Paris; a neighbor boy gets into their van, so when the oldest girl does a head count, all are accounted for. Except that little Kevin (Culkin), who was sent to bed early and wishes his family would disappear, isn't there. It's not until they're on the plane that his mother (O'Hara) realizes that Kevin is missing. While she attempts to get back to him, Kevin needs to fend for himself and also protect himself from two robbers (Pesci and Stern) who are systematically robbing the neighbors and have Kevin's house targeted.Very funny, often laugh out loud film with Culkin pulling all kinds of pranks to keep the criminals out, from making it look like he's not alone by queuing up video tapes of crime films and setting booby traps should they break in. He also takes the time to talk to a mysterious neighbor (Roberts Blossom) who is estranged from his son. Mom, meanwhile, ends up in a movers truck with John Candy.Culkin is adorable without being cloying, and the movie has a wonderful warmth about it as well. Not the type of thing I'd normally enjoy, but I sure enjoyed this one.",Home Alone
12,Quinoa1984,A well done family comedy,7,4 November 2000,"This type of family comedy truthfully works better if you are grown up with the stooges.  Because this film has a climactic scene with more slapstick than most can take.  I can though.  But if you think this is strictly a kids film, parents will like it too I bet. The plot follows a kid (Macaulay Kulkin) who gets left behind in a Chicago suburb while his family leaves for Paris.  And though the house is all his, 2 burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give the best on-screen duo of 1990) want the house.  But not without the climax.  While most of the film is unbelievable (both good and bad), most of the film should keep families in good spirits, unless parents don't enjoy seeing Pesci getting his head on fire and Stern screaming like a girl.  Funny, even if it's not John Hughes' (writer/producer here) best.  B+",Home Alone
13,edwagreen,Home Alone-Only He's Not So Lonely Here **1/2,6,10 December 2008,"The last half-hour of this 1990 film is hysterical as McCaulay Caulkin turns the tables on 2 dim-witted robbers, played phenomenally well by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.Come on. Even with a lot of children around, how could 4 adults leave young McCaulay behind? Of course, that's the plot so that he can make mischief, but it's a little silly here. Complicating matters, the Christmas holiday makes it difficult to get back home.The next door neighbor, an elderly gentleman, is regarded as an eerie individual. Only our young lad talks to him in church and gets him to try to contact his long-estranged son. How convenient.While there is love of family here, our little hero did quite well when left to survive for himself. He may very well be our young Robinson Crusoe.",Home Alone
14,sunwarrior13,A Good Family Entertainment,10,1 March 2015,"Home Alone is a Christmas family comedy about a young boy named Kevin, who is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in France over the holiday season.It stars Macaulay Culkin together with Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci. It was written and produced by John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus. Kevin McCallister is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. He initially relishes being home alone, but soon has to contend with two would-be burglars who are planning to rob every house in Kevin's suburban Chicago neighborhood. Eventually,Kevin tries to contend with the burglars on his own in this slapstick comedy.The film was the highest grossing comedy when it was theatrically released.It definitely provided a lot of joy,humor and entertainment.There was also no dull and boring moment.The cast did a marvelous job in their respective roles.While the movie at present as this review is being written may find this film somewhat overstretched as a comedy by today's standards,it will always be a good family entertainment.",Home Alone
15,studioAT,Classic? Not for me.,2,8 December 2015,"Home Alone is one of those Christmas films that pop up every year. It's many people's favourite modern Christmas film too. I just didn't like it.It couldn't cope with the overly sentimental subplot about the neighbour, the cartoon humour was too dark for my liking and as ever I found Macaulay Culkin annoying.It has its moments, don't get me wrong, but would I rate this as the best Christmas film of all time as others have- no! So good luck to you if you're dusting off the DVD and enjoying it with nostalgia. I'll instead watch 'The Santa Clause', a real modern classic.",Home Alone

17,Scarecrow-88,Home Alone,8,10 December 2013,"Home Alone will stand the test of time, methinks. Watching it tonight, I just find it too much fun. Culkin is certainly a bona fide star here, the groundwork laid in his wonderful work opposite John Candy in the John Hughes-directed, Uncle Buck. The plot—as if you didn't know it, right?—has 8-year old Culkin (quite wise beyond his years, if a bit precocious and, at times, mischievous) left accidentally alone while his parents and family go to Paris by plane to visit the father's brother for the Christmas Holidays. He must fend off two cartoonish, oafish burglars (calling themselves the ""wet bandits""!!!) robbing rich suburban houses on his block, their eyes mainly focused on thieving from his family's home. Pesci and Stern are positively hilarious as the not-so-bright thieves, winding up punished by Culkin's vast array of traps laid at the house they so desperately want to rob. There's a lot more to the film than just seeing the bandits fall prey to violent traps set by an intelligent kid; touched on is Culkin's loneliness without his family, dealing with a scary neighbor (Roberts Blossom, who is simply delightful) that has more to him than meets the eye, and a mother's devoted trip back home to her son. Of course, generations of fans will remember Culkin applying aftershave and shrieking and the ""Filthy Animal"" footage scaring both Stern and a pizza delivery boy.The visual silhouette trick where Culkin fools Pesci and Stern into believing there was a party taking place is brilliant. Terrific casting, with the likes of Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as the parents, and even the smaller parts (the aforementioned Blossom and John Candy as the leader of a Polka band who offers a rented van ride to O'Hara he and his traveling buddies use to get to a gig in Milwaukee, passing through Chicago on the way), only enhance the whole experience.While the Raison d'être might seem to be Culkin outsmarting dim-witted, numskull burglars—using violence from a Loony Tunes cartoon to do so—there's plenty more to enjoy here. Personally, I think Culkin as the anchor is one of the chief reasons this film remains so timeless and specialit's the perfect example of just-right casting.""This is my house. I have to defend it."" After building up some good will throughout, credibility does go out the window, but this final stand between Culkin and the bandits is so highly memorable, I think it's excusable. Plus, despite what we know would *really* happen if these two actually were shot by bb's from a bb gun, slip on purposely icy steps, get hit in the head with a crowbar, touch a doorknob heated extremely, stepped on a long nail, received an iron to the forehead, tripped (and landed on) hotwheels, get a blow torch flame to the top of the head (!!!), step barefoot first onto ornaments (Yikes!), and take a shot to the face by loaded paint cans(!), part of the fun is to suspend disbelief and take it all in stride. Stern's reaction to the spider (and the iron stamp on his face) is priceless. As is Pesci covered in feathers. Stern trying to hit the spider and instead crushing Pesci's chest only adds to the outrageousness of the final minutes.While I loved and anticipated the finale as a child, with all its Three Stooges violence, I think as an adult, the film prior to this leaves a great deal more of an impression. There's a lot of heart here, accompanying the pain of picking the wrong house to rob and the wrong kid to antagonize. After Blossom bops the bandits in the heads with an ice shovel, the film pretty much tells you it's only a movie. Culkin re-uniting with his parents is the heart-warming ending you could only expect; include especially Blossom re-uniting with his estranged son's family, and there's much to find beyond just two nitwits enduring bodily injury most normal folks would never recover from.",Home Alone
18,Hey_Sweden,"""You guys give up, or are ya thirsty for more?""",7,6 December 2011,"Eight year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, in his appealing break through lead performance) is frustrated enough with his family to ""wish them away"". And he gets this wish, sort of, when the entire family - parents, siblings, aunt & uncle & cousins included - is in such a rush to get to the airport in time for a trip to Paris that they leave him behind. At first, he has great fun with his temporary freedom and independence, but will eventually have to save his house from being burgled by a bumbling pair of oafs, Harry and Marv, played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. This he does by staging an elaborate series of booby traps.""Home Alone"" is a pretty charming little family comedy that does have quite a bit of heart to go along with all of the farce and slapstick. This material is indeed pretty funny, with Pesci and Stern playing their slow witted lowlife criminals for all that they're worth; some of their facial expressions and reactions are just hysterical. Some of it may be a bit much, and may not jibe that well with the more serious portions of the movie, but it's doubtful many kids watching are going to care that much.It does, in the end, make a very good case for the need for family, how we're perfectly capable of taking our loved ones for granted, how to deal with one's fears and do some growing up, and in the case of Old Man Marley (the excellent veteran Roberts Blossom), how it's never too late to mend relationships. The wonderful scene between Culkin and Blossom in the church where they make a connection is indeed the best moment in the entire picture. Kevin's been administered (erroneous) warnings about the old man's supposedly sordid past, and is understandably afraid of him, and realizes how one shouldn't be too quick to believe that sort of thing.Lovely funny woman Catherine O'Hara also does extremely well in the role of the mother willing to do anything that's humanly possible in order to atone for what she feels is an unforgivably stupid mistake. It's truly a treat to see her reunited with 'SCTV' co-star John Candy, who's as engaging as ever in his cameo role as polka star Gus Polinski. John Williams supplies an expectantly catchy score and touching song (both Oscar nominated, with song lyrics by Leslie Bricusse).Good fun overall, with a bright wrap- up, it's not surprising that the movie would have been such an enormous hit over 20 years ago, and it continues to entertain today.Seven out of 10.",Home Alone
19,preppy-3,WAY too violent. THIS got by with a PG??????,1,2 August 2010,"A heavily dysfunctional family are going away for the Christmas holidays. They accidentally leave 8 year old Kevin (the annoying Macauley Culkin) alone at home. Other than doing what a normal kid would do (go to a neighbor or call the police) he decides to stay at home all alone. Two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern--both who deserve better) try to break in. Culkin manages to single-handedly set up elaborate bobby traps to stop them.What a violent sick piece of garbage! I caught this is a theatre back in 1990. I saw it after a long week at work and expected a mindless fun PG movie. I was horrified by what I got. For starters the story was impossible. Leaving behind an 8 year old kid by mistake??? Come on! Also the whole family is heavily dysfunctional and not at all funny. Culkin manages to set up elaborate traps and stuff that no 8 year old could ever do. When Pesci and Stern show up the movie goes from stupid and unbelievable to extremely violent. These poor guys repeatedly get burnt and hit repeatedly on the head and face again and again--and it's all played for laughs! I was sickened by the level of violence in this film. How did this get a PG rating???? Also violence against people is NOT funny. It got to the point that I was rooting for the burglars. Aside from all this it just simply isn't funny. Sick, stupid and unbelievable yes--but NOT funny.The acting is as bad as you'd expect. Culkin is annoying from the start. Not cute at all--you want the little brat to get it badly. Stern and Pesci do what they can with nothing roles. Still, I realize I'm not the audience for this. In the theatre I saw it with was full of families with their kids. During the violence all the adults sat there horrified while all the little kids were screaming (literally) with laughter. A few parents dragged their kids out of there--I wish I had joined them. This was (inexplicably) a huge hit and led to the thankfully brief career of Culkin. Avoid this like the plague and definitely do NOT let small kids see it. A 1.",Home Alone
20,grantss,Mediocre,4,19 October 2014,"Mediocre attempt at a comedy. Will probably appeal to kids but not to anyone else.Fairly basic, slapsticky plot. Some of the methods the kid uses to protect his home are quite clever, but that's about the only positive aspect of this movie.What an irritating kid. The back-chatty replies to his parents, the general cockiness. Can see why kids would like this, and why adults shouldn't...Unfortunately, it spawned several sequels, and launched the career of Macaulay Culkin...",Home Alone
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Cute... but not much else,6,8 October 2005,"This is an odd one; I can't tell you how many times I've seen this film, yet every time is like the first. It just makes no lasting impression, and I'm always left feeling kind of cheated. The real problem here is that the only truly entertaining thing in the film(not the only funny, mind you) are the scenes of Kevin scaring off the burglars and the finale(which I won't write here, in case anyone reading this review hasn't seen the film yet). That's it. The rest of the film, sure, there are funny scenes, lines and such... but no real entertainment. The scenes of Kevin by himself, in the house, doing adult stuff are cute, but once you're over the age of ten, you won't really find them entertaining or funny... maybe you won't even see the charm I'm certain I must have seen in the scenes when I was younger. So what are we left with? Plenty of humor, some of which actually works and a few scenes of entertainment. About ten minutes of actual entertainment scattered over just over 100 minutes of film. That's just not enough. The plot is decent, but derivative and unoriginal. The characters are cardboard cutouts. The acting is fine, but no one is particularly impressive. John Williams' score is pretty good. What really bugs me about this film is the portrayal of violence as fun, and OK as long as it's against criminals. This is a film for children; is it really a good idea to show violence like that? To make it fun... and OK? I recommend this film only to people who are too smart to copy it... and it helps if you have a childish sense of humor. 6/10",Home Alone

However, the little lad is full of innovative ideas for fighting off their depredations, and the crooks themselves are woefully inept.This idea comes out, in practice, as a chunk of set-up and a slushily sentimental coda which bracket the centrepiece - the assault and defence on the McAllister house, which is played as a live action Tom And Jerry cartoon.Sentimentality is appropriate for a Christmas movie (and in any event it is good to see Catherine O'Hara, often in overstated comedic roles, playing with a softer edge). Besides, a dose of saccharine is a small price to pay for the wildly funny slapstick violence inflicted by Kevin on the hopelessly outclassed Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern). Both actors play with a broadness which is not only just right, but also absolutely necessary. And young Macaulay Culkin's Kevin is an engaging combination of resourcefulness, malice, and vulnerability.A hugely enjoyable family movie.",Home Alone
24,anaconda-40658,Staying Home Alone With Catherine O'Hara.,9,26 January 2016,"Home Alone (1990): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: MacCauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, Catherine O'Hara, John Candy: Surprisingly entertaining and engaging family holiday comedy that preaches to every kid's rebellion and that is freedom from parents. Plot regards eight year old Kevin accidentally left at home while his family went on a holiday vacation. The house is large allowing lots of room for Kevin to be innovative especially when a couple of criminals sight the house for theft. They are the Wet Bandits and they meet their match when Kevin booby traps the house resulting in slapstick mishaps that is a tad brutal. The booby traps look effective enough for a kid Kevin's age but the slapstick violence should result in discernment from parents. MacCauley Culkin is a find as the mischievous Kevin whose behavior has him wishing that his family was gone. He gets his wish when overlooked for the trip. Culkin is entertaining and full of energy as Kevin celebrates his freedom. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern play the two idiotic thieves who are assaulted with everything but the kitchen sink as they are outwitted by this kid. Catherine O'Hara plays Kevin's frantic mother who desperately tries to get back home to her son. John Candy provides a chuckle as the leader of a polka band that offers O'Hara a ride. While it toys with the idea of freedom, it also celebrates the reality of family unity. Score: 9 / 10",Home Alone
25,FlashCallahan,"Buzz, your girlfriend! Woof!!",9,9 January 2011,"8-year-old Kevin McAllister is accidentally left behind when his family takes off for a vacation in France over the holiday season. Once he realises they've left him home by himself, Kevin learns to fend for himself. He eventually has to protect his house against bumbling burglars Harry and Marv, who are planning to rob every house in Kevin's suburban Chicago neighbourhood. Kevin's mother Kate is frantic when she realises that she and the family have unintentionally left Kevin behind in Chicago, and she tries to make it back to Chicago as fast as she can, getting help from a polka band leader named Gus Polinski....After twenty years since it's release, this still is as original and fresh as the first time i saw it.It's a simple premise given that fantastic Hughes magic. And the running time is deceptively slim, as you feel you are watching a much shorter film. The first hour is Keving enjoying his freedom, final third, the 'torture' of Harry and Marv.And this is where the film really is magical, because no matter how many times you see Stern scream or fall down the stairs, you cannot help but laugh. In fact, Stern is the best thing in the film.As with most Christmas movies, there is a moral to the film, and the token cheesy ending and cheesy scenes, but the lines in the film and the chemistry of all the cast make up for that.With cameos from John Candy and allegedly Elvis Presley, this is just about the most perfect Christmas film for the whole family.And who wouldn't want to put firecrackers in a pot and out 'Angels with filthy souls' on full blast?",Home Alone

I am not wild about movies that are mainly about kids who get the best of adults, and this definitely fits the bill as one of those movies.  What really gets me, is this kid would not have gotten into all the trouble he did if he wasn't such a brat.  The family is trying to organize this big trip with all these other relatives, and all the their younger son can do is whine and complain.  ""I don't want to sleep with that kid"", ""I have to have my pizza a certain way"", stuff like that...and he is supposed to be the kid we are pulling for?  We get to see him left alone and do all the things kids do when they are left alone. Watch black and white old movies.  Yes, and this kid is such a wimp that a black and white mobster pick scares him.  Though he uses it so wisely later in the movie (yeah right, that would work).  This kid somehow outsmarts the two thieves even though earlier one of them is smart enough to impersonate a police officer and check all the security of the houses in the neighborhood. I guess his intelligence went down a notch or two.  Then there are the many clever traps that usually consist of someone getting hit in the groin area...ha ha ha!  It is always so funny to see someone get hit there and writhe in agony.  All in all this is just one bad movie that I did not care for at all.  I just wish the kid got into some kind of trouble for all the problems he caused.",Home Alone

Vanity Fair did a great write-up of the making of Angels of Filthy Souls in the article ""Inside the Making of ​ Home Alone​'s Fake Gangster Movie"" by Darryn King, which was published online on 22 Dec '15.Sure, Home Alone may not fit into the traditional canon (no girl wistfully wishing for a house on 34th Street) but it's one of my favorite Christmas movies next to Die Hard of course. In a way, Home Alone and Die Hard share similar themes of survival against the vicious criminals, with the hero using his wits and ingenuity to fight back and ensure the crooks get their just desserts.",Home Alone
28,Sylviastel,"Be Careful what you wish for, you just might get it!",10,4 June 2017,"I don't know why I avoided this film. It's a John Hughes classic film in his style of American suburbia. Macaulay Culkin has the startling role as Kevin McAllister in suburban Chicago town in a beautiful home. He plays the child precociously and with vulnerability at eight years old. After he is banished to the attic, he is forgotten the next day after his parents fly to Paris, France for a family holiday. There were fifteen in all. The scene where they are racing to the plane would be unrealistic today. Kevin believes his family left him alone. With two burglars played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, Kevin learns of their plot to burglarize his home as the silver tuna. Kevin's mother realized that she forgot him at home. Worried and desperate, she would do anything to reunite with them. There are noticeable Chicago actors like Ann Whitney and Alan Wilder in minor roles. Of course, there is John Candy in a small role as well. The cast did an excellent job with their roles. The film wasn't expected to be such a hit at the box office.

John Heard's character didn't seem like an high-level executive.What does stand the test of time is the violence and physical hell visited upon Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The Three Stooges live on in a John Hughes family film.I can see myself slamming this movie for the more sentimental Kodak moments . . . but my kid loves it and I love her giggles.

30,SimonJack,A funny Christmas film the first one or two viewsings,7,13 December 2020,"""Home Alone"" was a big hit in the theaters during the 1990 holiday season, and it remains a good comedy to watch over Christmas. But, unlike some other less silly Christmas time films, this is not a movie that stays funny with repeated viewings. After two or three years of holiday watching the film is worth an occasional smile, but it loses much of the fun and laughter the first time that grownups watch it. And, strangely, three decades after this movie appeared when kids got a kick out of it, many youths into the 21st century don't find it nearly as funny.One wonders if all the arcade machines and online and digital video games haven't deluged and numbed the senses of many young people. So much so, that plain antics and slapstick no longer seem funny to them.Anyway, with all the antics, mishaps, traps, and shenanigans that Macaulay Culkin's Kevin pulls off against the burglars who break into his home, this is a funny and fun film to watch. Play or watch it with kids and adults who haven't seen it before, but don't make it an annual viewing around the holidays.",Home Alone
31,StevePulaski,Some of the best childhood escapism ever put on film,8,17 November 2011,"Home Alone is often compared to something it was never trying to be; plausible. It is a very fictitious film. One only a child might like. Parents will be divided. I can see some laughing, some cringing, and some sleeping. Young children will appreciate it, the current generation of teens might, and those who grew up with it will continue to watch the constant reruns on Television during the Christmas season.While the concept is implausible, the story is simple. Eight year old Kevin McCallister (Culkin) is accidentally left home alone by his forgetful family during a hectic morning rush to get to the airport for their family vacation. Kevin enjoys having the house to himself after wishing he didn't have a family the night before. But then, he becomes the target for two bumbling criminals named Harry and Marv (Pesci and Stern).Kevin creates many booby traps throughout the whole film. He uses them to his advantage so that the criminals can suffer many, many obnoxious blows to the head. Some funny, some not. It's all up to the film's way of timing it. Some traps can be hysterical, while others become very redundant. I can see how plausibility clouds the viewers' enjoyment to the film because you know that no eight year old would be able to concoct if he was fed cough syrup to help him stay asleep during a cold.But Home Alone ultimately accomplishes one crucial element; giving cute and inspired scenes for the purpose of childhood escapism. Children love watching unrealistic things happening on screen. Especially when the protagonist is right around their age. This film is ideal for children of that age because it will tickle them that someone of their age can create such things like that. Then they will try and find one of their friends at school who can do the same sort of thing.It's delightful and cheery, but very dopey and slapsticky. I mentioned the jokes don't always work, but many times they certainly do. After all, there is something that tickles my happy place when I see someone of such a young age outsmart two criminals. There's something lying in that premise that brings out the child in me.This was of course produced by the teenager-whisper John Hughes himself. It seems after a very successful run of high school films he wanted to calm his brain and do one about a child. It's strange to watch a John Hughes film that occupies little to no coming of age elements, but still, Kevin is a bit too young to be truly finding his self-worth and purpose on Earth.Macaulay Culkin is a delightful young actor, but sadly hasn't gone on to do very many things in recent years unlike his two brothers Kieran and Rory, respectively. Culkin did however play a paraplegic in the Christian-satire Saved! which I instantly fell in love with. Here he's a lot younger and livelier, and you just knew he would go on to play the cute, ""innocent"" young boy in many other films while he was still a cute, ""innocent"" young boy.Home Alone will also resurrect memories from your youth when you were left home alone for the very first time. The house seems so much bigger, emptier, and more silent than it ever has before. It's the strangest feeling that only weakens over time.Like I said before, a person's generation and age will factor in greatly when judging if they like or dislike this film. Personally, it still holds up today. It's fresh, entertaining, and satisfying, but can be redundant at points. Home Alone was a cute concept, but the sequel treatment was anything but left alone. Still, as long as there are still devoted supporters of this cherished film, I can say that the repeated airings on popular cable networks will not cease in the immediate future.Starring: Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, and Daniel Stern. Directed by: Chris Columbus.",Home Alone
32,Smells_Like_Cheese,A timeless classic,10,23 November 2003,"Oh, come on, IMDb users. How could this film get only a 6.5? Yes, it's a kid's movie, but I know plenty of adults(not including myself) who loved this film. It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.10/10",Home Alone
33,MovieAddict2016,Heartwarming Holiday family classic.,10,18 February 2003,"'Home Alone' has succeeded in establishing itself as a Christmas tradition, spawning off three sequels (including a made-for-television flop), and a whole franchise in and of it.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the average American child. He has an attitude almost expected of a Chris Columbus film from the eighties. He lives with a large family, which, right now, being around Christmas time, is about quadrupled, flooded by relatives' children, all of whom pick on poor, poor Kevin (sympathy long lost later into the film).One day Kevin wakes up from his sleep to find his wish has come true: his parents (John Heard and Catherine O'Hara) have disappeared. Enthralled by this, he proceeds to do everything and anything he was not allowed to do before, including eating ice cream in the morning, watching violent gangster films, jumping on the bed, wrecking his brother's room, and having some fun with a BB gun. Unfortunately for Kevin, his parents have not just disappeared - they have accidentally left him at home before going to Paris!Trouble really starts when two pesky burglars, Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), decide that their next burglary will be at the McCallister residence. Little do they know Kevin is more than prepared, arming the house with an array of booby-traps that would impress top spies in the American government.John Hughes, writer/director/producer of my favorite comedy, 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles,' wrote this film, and it is no wonder. It is just like Hughes' humor. It mixes emotion, belly laughs and a warm-hearted ending all into one little bundle called a movie. John Hughes' films, in my experience, are usually very good, mainly because he approaches films at a very classic level. He doesn't resort to crude, kid jokes, like 'The Master of Disguise' or 'The Tuxedo,' to name a few recent flops. He almost always levels everything out perfectly in his scripts, and nothing is different here. Also, he places Kevin and co. in a large brick home in a large neighborhood in Chicago; a home that very much resembles those in 'Planes.' and 'Uncle Buck' (I would not be surprised if it is the same home).As for the acting.Macaulay Culkin is not at his best here. His best performance would have to be in an earlier John Hughes film named 'Uncle Buck,' where he had more of a cute charm than an acting charm. Here, he could barely act his way out of a plastic bag. Fortunately, with great performances by John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Pesci and Stern, his bad acting is long forgotten by the time we become absorbed into the film.John Heard and Catherine O'Hara bring Kevin's parents to life. They seem almost complete opposites. Kevin's father, Peter (Heard), is very calm and laidback. His mother, Kate (O'Hara) is extremely nervous almost all the time, fretting throughout the film. She is aggravated very easily and, like all mothers, her instinctive nature to care for her child is what drives her to the point she goes to in the film.And then there's Pesci and Stern. My favorite lot of the film. They perfectly blend humor, pain and aggravation to the film.Pesci's character Harry is very strict, easily agitated and picks on Marv for a great many things. Marv, the stereotypical 'tall, stupid one,' is completely stupid. He does things that would make a hamster blush. Yet he is the character I have found many like the most, mainly because he is so stupid you have to feel sorry for him. Stern brings a great trait to the character of Marv, and I am very pleased he got the part. It's a hard choice to decide which baddie is better, so I just say I like them both the same.All in all, 'Home Alone' is probably the best Christmas movie to rise out of the film industry in the last twenty years. It seamlessly blends humor, pain, emotion, human instinct and some great booby-traps all into one little bundle. This film has stood the test of time greatly.4.5/5 stars -",Home Alone
34,Rainey-Dawn,Not the Christmas Classic I Was Expecting It To Be,6,25 June 2014,"Home Alone is a very cute, lighthearted comedy. Kevin McCallister definitely has a way of detouring the criminals in a very comical way. This movie is a good family type of a film - so I do recommend watching it for those that have not seen it and love funny films.On the downside: Home Alone is not the Christmas classic I was expecting it to be. After watching the movie a couple of times I realized that this movie would not be among my favorite Christmas films to enjoy each year. Maybe I got the burn-out watching it.

36,OllieSuave-007,I'll be home alone for Christmas...,8,25 December 2015,"This is a pretty funny Christmas comedy, starring Macaulay Culkin in his signature role as eight year-old Kevin McCallister, who was accidentally left by himself in his home by his family after they jetted out to Paris for a vacation. Home alone, Kevin must make it on his own for several days and protect the house from a pair of crazy burglars.This movie started out frantically, with Kevin's dysfunctional family scrambling to ready their trip to Paris while giving off a vibe of overzealous humor and corny personalities. But, the film picks up for the better when Kevin found out he was left home alone and, as a result, we get to see his resourceful survival tactics and his plans to deal with the burglars. Culkin did a good job playing Kevin, giving off that innocent but intelligent characteristic.What I've found surprising was that this manic comedy also has some heartwarming moments about the Christmas spirit, family and faith. The subplot of Kevin's old, reclusive neighbor gives the film a good balance of drama and actually also gives some meaning to the overall Christmas theme of the story.The plot features some heartwarming moments and some off-the-chart humor featuring fast-talking loudmouth Joe Pesci and accident-prone Daniel Stern as the burglars, who gave us a good dose of slapstick comedy. Them tripping over Kevin's house traps and slippery slopes was pretty entertaining! Overall, it's a good ol' Christmas comedy that will lighten you up for the holidays! Grade B",Home Alone
37,Robert_duder,Ridiculously amazing classic Christmas film...apparently one of my favourites,10,3 December 2012,"When Home Alone released in 1990 I was about 12 so I was the perfect demographic and I loved it. I remember seeing it over and over again in the theatre. It was a HUGE runaway success and made Culkin one of the biggest stars in the world. I've probably seen the movie dozens of times but it has been a few years so I sat down to usher in the Christmas movie season with this one last night. My goodness, what a fantastic movie. I mean everything just works brilliantly for it to be a stone cold classic. Never mind the eventual battle against Marv and Harry which is hilarious with the quintessential gag and trap moments that had me howling out loud, but the overall story is sweet and touching and has so many layers to it. When you think Home Alone, you immediately think of the traps against the burglars but that doesn't even begin until 3/4 of the way through the movie. Everything just fits together perfectly from the cast to the scenery to the story and made me laugh out loud and even cry at the end. While I think it should be geared towards older children just because of some of the thematic elements, this is still a fantastic classic Holiday movie.It is easy to see why Macaulay Culkin was compared to Shirley Temple. His on screen charisma is inexplicable and palpable. I say inexplicable because he honestly doesn't exactly deliver lines particularly well, even awkward at times but it matters absolutely none because he is perfect and adorable and charismatic. The casting only gets better. Joe Pesci who I always find overly dramatic and hyper is born for the role as the headstrong bossy robber Harry. Watching him get bested and beat up is legendary. Daniel Stern plays Pesci's sidekick and the bumbling robber perfectly. The two of them together could not be a better fit for their respective parts. This was sort of Stern's pinnacle and it is easy to see why. The supporting cast are all just amazing. John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Devin Ratray, and Roberts Blossom all have such important roles and they are so terrific. Some are more subtle than others and they aren't necessary standout roles but they're fun and they work so well in the story. And of course the legendary John Candy makes a fun appearance in the story as well.Chris Columbus is a legendary director. He goes under-appreciated I think but he has such a bold style and everything is colourful and the setting is always as important as his characters and Home Alone is just a perfect fit for him. Add in the brilliant talent of the amazing late John Hughes and you have an absolute film making power couple. Maybe I'm overstating the film because it certainly isn't an Academy Award quality film and I'm sure it isn't critically acclaimed but it is sweet and so much fun and I forgot how truly great it was. I could have literally put the movie back in and watched it again. Make this part of your holiday routine!! 10/10",Home Alone
38,Lejink,Merry Kidsmas,7,6 December 2015,"That cover shot of young McCaulay Culkin's goofy face has put me off watching this festive movie for years but in mid December on a rainy, cold afternoon and having watched most of the best of the Christmas-themed movies around, I turned to this at last. And sure, Culkin gets more screen close-ups than Greta Garbo ever did, either due to the director wishing to emphasise his ""cuteness"" or maybe in some way to cover up his inexperience at acting, but the movie is so fun that you get used to it as it rolls entertainingly along.Seems to me that young Kevin gets the best Christmas present ever when, as he thinks, he makes his horrible family disappear over the holidays, but when house burglar Joe Pesci and his hapless accomplice determine to loot Culkin's parents' house, the fun and games commence as the kid fights back, plus of course there's time for a big dollop of Yuletide sentimentality as the youngster makes friends at last with the sinister-seeming old man next door, sorting out the latter's family problems in the process.The movie's really fun as you warm to the initially brattish Kevin and have to admire his methods of keeping the baddies at bay, firstly with his automated mannequin show and then of course when he seemingly booby-traps the whole house to repel the invaders. Pesci is very good, offering us a family-entertainment version of the psychos he plays for Scorcese, with nary a cuss-word in sight but it's the kid's movie with young McCaulay's acting improving as the movie progresses which almost makes me think the film was shot in chronological order.I have to admit that before watching, I expected this to be an indigestible slice of over- sentimental nonsense, but instead was well-entertained by a clever and funny family feature which rightly deserves its reputation as a latter-day Christmas dare I say classic.",Home Alone
39,ElMaruecan82,The first Christmas classic of the 90's!,8,22 December 2017,"I know this is a ""triple F"" and ""triple C"": feel-good fun family and classic Christmas comedy... so you'll forgive me to be a triple ass and introduce this review with a downer opening. Here it goes.We're in 2017, John Candy is comedy legend (sadly of the dead sort) since the mid-90's, John Hughes died in the same untimely fashion eight years ago, followed by Robert ""Old Man Marley"" Blossoms two years later and John Heard, the father with such a lovable face, has died this summer. Sorry to go on this eulogy but even Roger Ebert and Gene SIskel who gave two thumbs down to the movie because of its implausible narrative and sadistic treatment of the villains, are also gone. This is just to show how this 1990 classic is already surrounded by an aura of nostalgic sadness.Of course, Chris Columbus, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are alive and much alive but look at Macaulay Culkin, another sad example of the devastating effects of child stardom, although he's probably richer than I but he didn't exactly follow the 'Natalie Portman' path, not even the Anna Chlumsky one. Whenever I see him on the screen, I can't help but think of how this cute little face has turned to, but there are so many sad things about the lives that contributed to the movie that it almost plays like a sort of shelter for laughs, a time capsule for December 1990 or the whole early 90's, where we can comfortably enjoy Christmas in the lovable and cozy McCallister house and forget about the real stuff, the time of a movie.It's funny that there's so much escapism in such an enclosed movie.Besides, watching ""Home Alone"" again in 2017 allows us to appreciate a time where even a good old-fashioned comedy could hit the box-office jackpot and be the highest grossing movie. No superheroes, no Transformers, no magical superpowers, the (r)evolution was on march, sure, but it didn't take much at that time to draw audience to the theaters, what counted was a simple concept and an appealing main character. The concept here is simply terrific: what would happen if a boy was left alone in his home? and during Christmas holidays at that, and when the kid is played by such an adorable and talented kid as Macaulay Culkin, half the work is done. There's also an interesting implication, every kid would love to be alone in such a big home (granted he's got enough to eat or buy food) but how about when it happens at the very time where you count on the presence of adults.... even for selfish reasons.I concede that John Hughes didn't really try to make an existential plot out of the concept, and picked the easy way, which was a confrontation between the boys and bad guys... but what bad guys! As Hitchcock said, a film is as good as the villain and Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern form a very interesting variation of 'Laurel and Hardy', 'George and Lenny', 'George and Junior' or 'Pinky and the Brain', the interaction between the two burglars while not reinventing the wheel, is the perfect foil to little Kevin's quick wits, agility and ability to come up with the most ingenuous devices in order to 'defend his home'. I think it's safe to consider that the film was already a winner once they got the concept, the kid and the villain. The rest was just a sort of icing on the cake, what kind of booby traps to install in the house, how to make it 'impossible' for the parents to reach their kid or for him to get help, and of course the 'spirit'... otherwise it wouldn't be a Christmas movie.So of course, it's going to be implausible, with such a title as ""Home Alone"", you either have a comedy or a horror/thriller and if the movie had to be 'realistic', it wouldn't have taken more than three hours (movie time) to get Kevin out of the house and arrest the burglars. But we wouldn't have a movie either, we wouldn't have the 'Playboy' scene, the after-shave moment inspiring the iconic recreation of the 'Edvard Munch' painting with Kevin's trademark scream, whose only match was Marvin's shrill arachnophobia reaction. The film is a Christmas classic because it has filled that over-the-top category, if you want a movie that recreates the fun of Christmas in a realistic way, you have the no-less iconic ""A Christmas Story"", but the concept of ""Home Alone"" could only work with that level of slapstick. AndCulkin's performance is so good it even conveys a sort of edgy attitude, he's not your typical kid either, but he's still convincing enough as a kid.It's not just a matter of suspension of disbelief, but of ""let it go"" for the sake of innocent fun, of course, watching this right now reveals some baffling contrivances we couldn't spot where the film came out, yes, we know the supposedly shovel murderer isn't a bad guy, we know Kevin relies a lot on the assistance of luck and perfect timing, we know it will all come down to the powerful family reunion and Catherine O'Hara provides the emotional arc of the film. Yes, it's true Marv and Harry aren't so bad they really deserve all the hurtful stuff that happen to them, and Kevin's scream can get annoying at times, but the film is closer to a live-action cartoon than a realistic comedy.And there is no way for ""Home Alone"" not to make it in any Top 10 of classic Xmas movies, but maybe I'm biased because it was totally the kind of movies we used to watch countless times as kids to the point I always identified Tchaikovski's ""Nutcracker"" music as the 'Home Alone' theme.",Home Alone
40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A true Christmas classic for any season.,8,16 March 2018,"The strange slapstick turn that the silly third act takes is a bit of an odd choice which remarkably doesn't stunt the film's growth despite being a departure from the relatively down-to-earth proceedings that precede it. It's only because it acts as a natural extension to the expert character development already done in the first two acts that it slots in so successfully, ending 'Home Alone (1990)' on an uproarious if (strangely) slightly sadistic note which represents the hero's transformation from naïvely vulnerable to cunningly independent. The layered screenplay puts everything in its perfectly imperfect place during the impeccable set-up, allowing for the forgetting of a child to become wholly believable and entirely empathetic. Plus, the wonderfully ostentatious performances place everything in a state of heightened reality ripe for rib-tickling laughter and heart-warming sentiment. A true Christmas classic for any season. 8/10",Home Alone
41,Cineanalyst,Angels with Filthy Souls: Die Hard for Kids,7,20 January 2021,"Another amusing Christmas heist flick ripping off ""Die Hard"" (1988), as others have pointed out already--complete with family problems, a protagonist practically breaking the fourth wall by cracking jokes alone, and bleeding feet--""Home Alone"" is a lot funnier than I remembered it being. The cast is great. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern mug it up. Catherine O'Hara is always good, even if her full comedic talents are underutilized here relative to her parts in Christopher Guest mockumentaries or the TV series ""Schitt's Creek."" Besides, her character is the only member of the family who really seems to care that they forgot a child across the Atlantic Ocean and then some. Roberts Blossom should talk more in this one, because his manner of lip smacking in between short phrases is ASMR triggering. John Candy on another holiday road trip--this time talking about abandoning his little one with a corpse at a funeral parlor. And, of course, Macaulay Culkin. Boy, that kid was famous--probably hasn't been a child movie star that big since and, besides Shirley Temple and Jackie Coogan, before.Besides breaking fourth walls with the raise of eyebrows, his Kevin enjoys time to himself, eats and watches trash, sleds down staircases, cares about hygiene and keeps a tidy home when not destroying his brother's room or mutilating criminals, shows interest in his hobby of using stuff around the house for an elaborate home security system, and screams into the void every once in a while. I mean, he's got life figured out. Granted, he gets whiny about missing his family after only a couple days, but he's only eight years old, so I suppose that may be forgiven. It's just a fun film. The early hectic family scenes, including the rush to the airport, make this enjoyable from the start, and the film-within-the-film parodying ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" (1938) is a gas, as well. To top it off, they got John Williams to do the score.",Home Alone
42,g-bodyl,Very Funny!,10,8 July 2008,"Home Alone is a very funny Christmas classic of the early 1990's. I thought that this film would be good, but it's much better than that. The story is about a young child whose family leaves him at home when they all go to Paris. Two dim-witted burglars realize that as well. They planned on robbing the house with no one in their way. Little did they know that Kevin would be the hero of the household. The acting in this film is good especially the robbers played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. They were the funniest part of the film. I also like the music in this film then again I always liked John Williams' music. The only thing a little wrong is the violence. A PG-13 rating would have been more suitable. Otherwise, this is perfect. I rate this film a 10/10.",Home Alone

I know there are flaws, I know there are plot holes, and I know the acting is over-the-top at times, but I still love this movie. It still makes me laugh and it still makes me feel the Christmas spirit. I plan on making this film a holiday tradition as soon as my kids are old enough to know they shouldn't reenact certain scenes.",Home Alone
44,lesleyharris30,"Great Fun to Watch with the Family at Christmas time,",8,17 December 2012,"Home Alone is a good movie with a well developed plot and a talented cast. It's a fun and very sweet movie that I always enjoy to watch at Christmas time, a simple story that is consistently funny and contains enough spirit to keep the whole family entertained.The film lacks depth. I felt Kevin's relationship with his family members could have been established much better before he was left home alone, so that we could fully understand why he was happy to be on his own at first, and be able to feel for the character when he begins to realise how much he misses his family. The last twenty minutes of the film are way too frantic, though it may be fun to watch Pesci and Stern fall over and get hurt, it becomes overly slapstick and completely drops the sentimentality and Christmas atmosphere that it was establishing very well previously. It should not have thrown hat all away.The cast is terrific, particularly Macaulay Culkin, a very charismatic and natural young actor, as well as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, too funny characters that you love to hate, their on screen chemistry is fantastic. Roberts Blossom's performance is very passionate, in an inspired way, his story is the heart and soul of the movie. It's a charming, harmless film that you can appreciate for what it is. It certainly has its imperfections, but Home Alone mostly makes up for that by being entertaining, and will bring a smile to the whole family. Kevin is left home alone while the rest of his family go on a vacation to France during Christmas. At first, he enjoys it, but soon finds out burglars are planning to rob his house. Best Performance: Roberts Blossom",Home Alone
45,CuriosityKilledShawn,Merry Christmas Ya Filthy Animal!,7,14 December 2006,"In the Eighties, John Hughes churned out a handful of movies and scored many, many hits. Quite rightly, as most of them were seriously funny - I'm DEFINITELY not referring to Curly Sue, so relax! In one particular scene from Uncle Buck, Macaulay Culkin interrogates a babysitter through the letterbox to make sure she's not a baddie. This inspired Hughes to write a whole new movie. Who would have known that this and its sequel would go on to become two of the biggest hits of all time? Both Hughes and Chris Columbus seem to prefer setting their movies during the holiday season (Gremlins, Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Christmas Vacation) and manage to pull them off without too much sentiment, or sickening amounts of gooey love.There are two reasons why Home Alone was such a big success. The first is that it's about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there's a worldwide conspiracy of silence. This movie yells it out loud and clear. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the movie way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded. It was nominated for an Academy Award, along with the Christmas carol Somewhere In My Memory, but lost to John Barry's Dances with Wolves. Damn! In a mad rush to the airport one morning, the MacCallister family forget one little thing...Kevin (Culkin). He is an eight-year-old kid who wants nothing better than a peaceful Christmas and some time to himself. It's hard for him to get this when living in a house with seven other people(the exact same house from Planes, Trains And Automobiles, don't you know0. With the rest of the MacCallisters in Paris, Kevin runs wild doing whatever he wants, eating whatever he wants and watching whatever TV show he wants.But there's one major problem. The Wet Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), are on the prowl and have knocked off every other house in Kevin's street. His is next. And seeing that he's man-of-the-house now, he HAS to defend it.Using whatever tools are at his disposal (rusty nails, blow torches, Micro Machines) he sets up a labyrinth of booby traps, so that the Wets can't break in. Their idiot-proof determination proves to be their downfall, as they are tortured and torn-up upon entering Kevin's domain.Although this is not the only point of the film, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.There are some movies that work best at Christmas and this is one of them. I'm not saying that in a couple of decades it will be the new It's A Wonderful Life, but it will be remembered fondly at the very least.Don't be a Scrooge. It's Christmastime. Go rush to check out Home Alone.",Home Alone

47,ironhorse_iv,Home Alone watching Home Alone,7,5 October 2012,"John Hughe's 1990 classic story, ""Home Alone"" directed by Chris Columbus -- Not only did this slapstick family comedy single-handedly launch the career of it's childhood star Macaulay Culkin, it also holds the distinction of being one of the highest grossing Christmas film of all time with over 475 million in box office revenue worldwide. Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, an eight-year-old boy, frustrated with his family, who wishes he didn't have one. We as the audiences don't blame him, as most of the family member's really do treat him horrible: mostly the Uncle and brother Buzz. The family is made out of mother Catherine O'Hara, father John Heard, Devin Ratray and Roberts Blossom in other family roles. When he wakes up on Christmas morning the next day, he discovers he's been accidentally left home alone after his entire family flies to Paris on vacation, and forgets about him. It's does feed the same story as ""It's a Wonderful Life"", in a very odd way, when it applies to both the main character and the supporting cast, where both sides wish that the main character never existed and when they are apart they realize they really do love each other and want to be together for Christmas. At first, he's relishing the time with himself. I'm surprise that the pizza guy didn't call the cops in one of Kevin's pranks, but the closing it get to Christmas, the more he miss his family and matured. Matters are complicated when two bumbling burglars attempt to rob the large house Kevin is home alone in played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci known as the Wet Bandits. The two adult idiots quickly get outsmarted by a kid is always fun in a sick demonic way and protected his home. Kevin eventually manages to outwit them with a series of booby traps and tricks. Now, it's a race between time, as the parents rushing home to rejoin Kevin, and the Bandits trying to hurt him. I wonder what would happen if Kevin accidentally kills them. Would he be charge for man slaughter? Parents should still watch the movie, just in case if the movie has way too much violence and swearing in the movie. The characters in the movie are presented as cartoon-like. But the fact remains the actors are real people and not animated images, and the visual effects are done with a very high degree of realism. It's a bit disturbing. That the protagonist is himself a victum of child abuse is a bit disturbing in itself. The violence he inflicts on others is only an acting out of the resentment and rage he fosters towards his parents. So there might be something wrong with Kevin, indeed. Still, one of the most memorable aspects of Home Alone is the score by John Williams. It's amazing to hear. I love the planning song. The slapstick might be cruel, but in heart, the movie does have a Christmas theme with the story of Kevin and his snow- shovel carrying neighbor. It's truly a XMAS movie indeed.",Home Alone

John Williams has another great score here!This is a perfect movie for people to watch around Christmas and if you need a big laugh watch this as it will crack you up!

52,zkonedog,"""I Made My Family Disappear""",10,11 March 2017,"Some movies are made strictly for adults. Others will bore the heck out of us ""seasoned"" viewers and appeal only to children. Luckily, this movie is made for everyone!For a basic plot summary, ""Home Alone"" sees young Kevin McCalister (Macaulay Culkin) waking up a few days before Christmas in a completely empty house, his extremely large and rather disorganized family having left him behind on their trip overseas. While the family tries to get back home, Kevin must outwit a pair of two-bit thieves (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) who want nothing more than to loot his home.What really makes this film special is the wide appeal of the humor. One could literally sit down with the entire family (from young to old) and watch this movie, and everyone would be laughing all the way through. From young Kevin's attempts at ""holding down the fort"", to the bumbling burglars played brilliantly by two veteran actors, this is the type of movie that you will be quoting long after the TV is turned off.Thus, I highly recommend ""Home Alone"" to quite literally anyone, especially during the Christmas season. If you have a list of ""Must-See"" holiday movies, this one should be right next to Frosty, ""Wonderful Life"", and claymation Rudolph!",Home Alone
53,johnnyboyz,"Straining for our fondness and doing its best to try our patience on occasion, the film remains snappy and often funny enough in spite of its shortcomings.",6,2 February 2012,"I didn't think George Romero's 1985 film Day of the Dead was the piece I was going to come away from Home Alone thinking about the most. Certainly, in terms of structure, there is that overriding sense of the first two thirds of the film acting as gentle 'filler' to the bigger picture; pleasant foundations easing into a final act arriving with such an explosion that when we watch it all unfold, we observe just how much craft and panache has been put towards it when placed up against mostly everything that preceded it. The respective sequences are, of course, when the undead run amok in what was up to that point a safe haven for the few remaining human beings left in the United States and that moment those two burglars in Chris Columbus' 1990 comedy Home Alone make it to the lead's house so as to ransack it.Up to these respective points, we could be forgiven for misplacing that said films were necessarily either respective horror or comedy movies at all. In the case of the Romero movie, that was OK: we enjoyed the clash between those indebted to science and those not; between those with trying to learn and understanding beings initially alien to them and those wanting to round them all up and get rid of them as soon as possible. In comparison, the build up to Columbus' explosion of style, craft and third act circumstance into which you genuinely feel the most energy has been pumped contains a scene in which one of those typically overweight American police officers goofily slips on a stretch of ice as he chases after an infant accused of stealing a toothbrush. Ho hum.In spite of this, Home Alone is a fairly resounding effort on the whole without really ever creeping above a certain threshold of meagerness. It is a child's film, for sure, and one they'll no doubt enjoy watching as the kid protagonist thwarts an array of grownups in both a physical and authoritarian sense. They'll sympathise with the lead and his marginalisation at the hands of uncles and brothers, and they'll respond to his predicament of actually being away from family members and parents whilst having to get by on one's own as the first and foremost source of adventure. Remarkably, the film works as well as it does from an adult perspective; child orientated goals aside, it is made with the best of intentions and competently enough in spite of the fact one can only hold a certain amount of sympathy for a young child wanting all the attention without getting it whilst disparagingly privy to a three storey house in a part of the world which always sees snow at Christmas time and with a family capable of affording expensive holidays to far off locales.It is Macaulay Culkin playing Kevin McCallister, an infant boy stuck at home at Christmas time with his extended family on the eve of their big holiday away to Paris. Kevin is an outcast, and both frustrates and is frustrated by them. One line, as he stamps up and down on the landing, as he shouts: ""When I grow up and get married, I'll finally be able to live alone!"" captures his forthright but ignorant stance. After wishing them gone and he alone, the following morning sees a mad dash and a miscount resulting in the McCallister's halfway over the Atlantic and Kevin still in an attic convert. Cue a lot of shenanigans; a rush to get home to him and a passable framework to do with the lead's realising family are actually something to cherish. Proper antagonism arrives in the form of two burglars, Marv (Stern) and Harry (Pesci); a couple of crooks whose trademark is to fill the sinks of their victims and leave the taps on to induce flooding – rather humorously, they scope out neighbourhoods in a van kitted out to look like a plumbing company and as they 'toast' crowbars whilst spying the McCallister residence, an amusing cut to inside Kevin's house sees a TV cartoon broadcast depicting The Grinch: they are indeed out to wreck Christmas.The various strands and subplots just about hang together; Kevin's mother's sub-Planes, Trains & Automobiles trek back home, complete with an eccentric John Candy figure, is kicked around for laughs but just feels like John Hughes paying homage to himself, while Kevin's integration with a road sweep, whose psychosis ends up being a lot more balanced than was initially established, allows Kevin to see things through more grounded eyes. The road-sweep and our lead share a scene in a church which, quite literally, sees the conclusion of Kevin's framework all but verbally confirmed whilst revealing what it is he's come to learn during this experience - the following fifteen minutes a part of the final twenty seeing the film make that aforementioned step up into a final act of second unit genre onslaught when Marv and Harry finally try to rob the McCallister house. Where the narrative is weak with the whole exercise sporadically feeling spineless, its lead carries the film in a surprisingly diligent manner whereas composer Williams finds a delicate place in between unnerving, on account of some theremin riffs during the opening as a small home is dwarfed by the film's ominous ""Home Alone"" title card, to reassuring and quite pleasant with a thoroughly competent score. Columbus keeps the thing cracking along at a brisk old rate, and while the wheels threaten to come off, it is actually somewhat of a relief overall that they do not.",Home Alone
54,leplatypus,A true Christmas Gift (DVD),10,12 June 2010,"The kid is fan of kid movies so I think to those movies because I count them as masterworks: they knew how to blend a lot of strong elements and are unique for that: they mix the best holidays (Christmas) and its wonderful spirit, the values of family, the cartoon fun (with the thieves) and a great soundtrack (magical score from John Williams as well as Christmas songs)! My preference however goes to the first movie: the setting in this huge mansion with snow outside is what everyone can dream for Christmas! And it's true that when you are a kid you fantasize about being home alone. A lot have been said about Culkin but he was truly good for the job: not a spoiled brat but a kind and witty kid. Beyond the cast was really great from the mother to the exceptional Joe Pesci (and don't forget Heather!).The kid was under the spell right away: as soon as we watched it, he recognized the sound of John Williams (""It's like Harry Potter) and I realize why the pair was chosen on this adaptation.

I keep forgetting how small he is until the Wet Bandits hang him on the coat rack towards the end. He's a little boy. Yet, he carries a whole movie. It's amazing.

There is a lot of fun and drama in a fast paced movie where one child takes on two criminals and he defends his home from being robbed. The movie has a ton of classic one liners. There isn't really anything wrong with the movie except for some minor nitpicks. The adult language tends to be a bit much for the little one's ears.,Home Alone
58,Vartiainen,Oozing with Christmas,8,8 January 2019,"A movie that very much came to define the decade it started. Home Alone is a cheesy, lighthearted, popcorny action-comedy-drama. And a really good Christmas movie to boot. Kinda like Die Hard.We all know the story, I trust. Kid gets left behind during the holidays and then has to defend his house against a couple of bumbling burglars. Traps are involved. Traps to make the Looney Tunes proud.And it works, it really works. But I would argue that the reason this film has stayed with people and the reason we still watch it, is because the director Chris Columbus injected in so much Christmas spirit that you'll be stuffed to the brim with it. This is a colourful movie with beautiful sets and enough Christmas lights to provide for an international airfield. It has Christmas songs, Christmas classics on TV. It has a great tree, great morals, and it's just to very Christmassy.At the center of this is Kevin, played by Macaulay Culkin. A wide-eyes, precocious little brat that manages to pull off the almost impossible feat of acting realistically childlike - you know, like a sociopathic, greedy little monster - but still coming off as sympathetic. And sure, in his heart he's a good kid, but the reason we like him is because he's so cheerfully blood hungry. And because he honestly and purely loves Christmas.Is it an odd movie when you think about it? Yeah, a bit. Is it a bit painful to watch all those traps as an adult with a working knowledge of physics? Yes, oh very much so. Is it still a ton of fun? Absolutely.",Home Alone

He actually doesn't mind the piece and quiet that he normally doesn't get. But then a due of robbers decide to rob his house, he makes it his mission to not allow them to, whilst setting them on fire, getting them to step on broken glass and fall down stairs. It's very entertaining. But when you think closely about it, why was this kid so into hurting them? They didn't have guns. Why didn't he just call the police like a kid is supposed to be taught to?

63,hellraiser7,Home for the Holidays,10,28 November 2019,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time as well as one of my favorite Christmas films.It's also another one of my childhood gems, it's was just so much fun for so many reasons but also heartfelt at the same time. I really like the plotline as it's sort of a wishfulment fantasy being the man or woman of the house and just having complete freedom to do whatever you want and make your own rules.There is so much to like, from the production value, which is great, really like how the traps were set up and conducted. Even the music is great, from some soundtrack bits but it's really the score by one of my favorite composers John Williams which makes it the most memorable. From that theme song which is one of my favorite themes of all time, as it has both a Christmas tune but at the same time a sense of foreboding as it reminds us as fun and cheerful as the film is there is still trouble in paradise. But another tune which is ""All of my Memories"" is just beautiful and perfectly reflects the theme of the film.I really like the characters, from the Wet Bandits Harry and Marv played well by Joe Pechi and Daniel Stern. Both your classic comic duo much like Abbot and Costello and any other you can think about, both are so much fun as both are pretty much numb skulls.Well Harry is more the smart one of the bunch as it seems like he the only one that really supplies the brain power of their schemes. However, this guy is no genius as his Achilles heel is that he's arrogant thinking he's so clever and listens too much to his own greed which we know both these things can make people stupid or do some stupid crap.Marv is pretty much Harry's flunky as he's dumb. But what makes him really funny is how he's a bit of a man child sometimes, like having these delusions of grangur in being one of the most famous criminals in history by leaving the water running as their calling card as ""The Wet Bandits"", despite the fact he clearly needs a reality check as he's just increased their chances of getting caught and identified. But I really love some of his lines, he's got some great lines, one of my favorites ""he sounded like a snake"" I know a small line but it's funny on two counts.But of course, my favorite character is the main protagonist Kevin McCallister played well by Macaulay Culkin. I really like that he's not some stereotypical annoying all smiles kid. Kevin really felt like a real kid whom is a relatable character as some of what he's gone though is some of the things that we may have experienced a time or two in our lives when we were kids.It's interesting what kind of household he lives in which must be the busiest household I've ever seen as it seems populated with twenty plus people. I remember whenever I watch the film, I always wonder who that person or the other in the family is. I honestly wouldn't mind if they made some sort of TV program (on a premium channel) called ""The McCallister's"" where we could see Kevin and the rest of the family years later, get to know the rest of them and see what shanagans they get into. If not there's always a licensed comic book, follow up; and if one or both these happened it would be the true third sequel. Well, it's a nice thought anyway.Alright back to Kevin, he's charismatic, has some of the best lines in the film. My favorite from him is ""This is it, don't get scared now"" yeah that's the kind of line I use whenever there is a final battle in certain Horror movies or survival horror video games. The film is almost at times like a one man play sometimes as in most scenes Kevin has only himself to talk to, but he does it so well because he's got a lot of interesting things to say.I really love how smart he is, this guy you could say could almost be a genius as he's a tactician, from building those elaborate traps. However, he is still naive like a child which increases the relatability factor as we've been through that. Like one of my favorite scenes is seeing Kevin dig though Buzz's trunk and he first looks though a Playboy magazine and says one really funny line that cracked me up ""No clothes on anyone sickening"", yeah that what most of us and myself felt at Kevin's age.However, the one thing about him that makes him the most enduring is he is highly sympathetic. He has a big family but he is the only one that is the most underappreciated, doesn't really get much attention nor help when he needs and asks for it, none of the breaks and for some fraked up reason seems to be the target of ridicule for most family members, seriously what the frak is everyone's problem.Like in one scene he is trying to ask some people to help him pack a suitcase as he's never done it before, which is understandable because he's still really little which means there are a lot of things, he's never done himself before. But of course no one is or wants to help him do it, seriously not one member could take five to ten minutes of their life to show/help him pack, it wouldn't of killed them instead they act like they have more important things to do which they don't.The worst of all is Buzz, this is a guy you sort of love to hate as he's kind of funny or even just plain hate as he really presses a wrong button with you. What I really don't like about the guy is that he's is just so full of crap; from that story he tells both Kevin and another brother about a neighbor you just see as he's telling that he has a crap eating grin on his face, so you know the story is bull crap just to get cheap amusement. And another which was eating Kevin's Cheese Pizza on purpose and insulting Kevin once more, thinking he's so funny which pushes Kevin over the edge.I really love that Kevin retaliated, I'd do the same thing any bully that ever takes away my Cheese Pizza or even video game playing are going to meet Goku and Vegetta (my left and right fists); I know that sounds bold but human right need to be defended.Sadly, Kevin unfortunately get punished for something that wasn't his fault, let alone doesn't even have dinner. But the last part of that scene are really sad when instead of the mom talking and exercising understanding with Kevin to hear what really happened, she just retorts in a mocking and insulting tone, which I thought was uncool, I guess she forgot the old saying ""if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all"" At that moment I just knew that was the final straw and Karma was about to come down on the family hard.There are so many great and memorable scenes and moments throughout the film, so there is hardly a dull moment.One of my favorite scenes no doubt is when Kevin is watching a gangster pic and of course he's eating probably the biggest ice cream sundae I've ever seen, man I can never eat that many scoops. That film he watches is great, I honestly thought that was a real movie but no it's not. This is something as kids we always dreamed about which was to see Rated R films without restrictions.I just love the exaggerated nature of the film as we see the lead gangster Johnny solve his dilemma with a Tommy Gun (yeah that does work every time in those pics) and he just says one of my favorite movie quotes that cracked me up, ""Keep the change you filthy animal."" But I really like Kevin's reaction to that film as he's closing his eyes despite the fact there is no gore or squib effects. But for a kid his age that would be considered graphically violent and not something he's totally used to seeing. And this joke with the gangster movie gets funnier as we see it used in two different scenes in two different ways.And of course, there is the famous big battle near the end of the film which is in my book one of my favorite battles of all time. It's basically a home invasion battle which I think is cool because it's sort of like a strategy game battle, since the battle takes place on your own turf it makes you the general, giving you plenty of opportunities to tactically take out invaders whichever area they occupy. But of course, it's pretty much a slap stick/ physical comedy fest as we see the Wet Bandits constantly getting hurt by Kevin's traps and miraculously surviving, this was just hilarity at it's best, it made me laugh till it hurt.I'll just say a couple of my favorites as I don't want to give too much away, from the first scene seeing Kevin use the BB gun on both robbers, it's just funny how Harry reacts to the pain and he is just saying a bunch of gibberish in frustration.Another of course is the nail trap, it's funny because of just the delayed reaction as it pain doesn't even register until a little latter and I just laughed along the way.However, despite all the fun of the film this film has heart as the revolving theme is about appreciating family. There is one scene I found sad when Kevin is looking at a family whom is home for the holiday's enjoying Christmas, he has a sad look on his face, which I'll admit put a tear in my eye. That scene shows what Kevin truly wanted which was simply to have Christmas with his family. Or even some bits with the family feeling guilt over the loss of Kevin from the mom evaluating her own parenting and a member or two not enjoying their time in Paris as they know in their hearts it's not a real vacation as their family is incomplete.This just makes the pay off even sweeter, I'll just say both Kevin and the Macalister's get what they want for Christmas. No one is ever alone for the holidays as long as there are still people that love you.Rating: 4 stars",Home Alone
64,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,12 March 2017,"A psychopath in the making. Hannibal Lecter as a child. Here we see the development of a very young Ted Bundy.It's a movie about a sadist child that is left alone and gets to torture two people and eat cheese pizza until his little heart is content.But don't worry, the guys that he is torturing are burglars so it's OK that the kid violates the Geneva Convention..so it's fine that you are laughing at a child torturing bad guys...they are, after all, bad guys.There are educated men, like me, that used to love to play GTA and kill my best friends in HALO because, we love to show that sadistic side...if no one gets hurt.I live in a world where I have to say ""Oh my God, are you OK?"" when someone gets hurt...and when I get off I go hang out with my friends who would be acting very strange indeed if they didn't laugh first when I got hurt.Ask my Girlfriend, my mom, and my little sister...ask any woman I have ever dated, it's not just a guy thing, they all love watching me hurt myself.This movie has caught a lot of flack, but it does so because it is made for the part of you that wants to laugh at someone else's pain. It does a wonderful job of showcasing how funny it is when people get hurt...The issue is that they don't want to admit that they think someone's pain is funny.",Home Alone
65,strong-122-478885,Holy Cow! Holy Cow! Holy Cow! Ad Nauseam,4,29 January 2017,"While watching Home Alone it became so plainly obvious (to me) to see just why Macaulay Culkin would never, ever survive his transition from being a child star into anything that even resembled that of a successful actor as an adult. Never. And, it's true. He wouldn't. 'Cause, believe me, he didn't.The writing was so clearly written on the wall for Culkin. And it was quite plainly evident even here in Home Alone. I mean, just like child star Shirley Temple, all of Macaulay's appeal and charm rested solely on the pre-packaged concept of her/him being perceived as that little tyke who was just the sweetest of all the ""cutie-pies"" imaginable.Like, let's face it, it takes real talent (as well as a certain amount of cuteness, of course) to make it as an adult actor. It does. And talent is something that Culkin seemed to possess so very-very little of (and it showed) once he had grown out of that darling, little ""baby"" phase of his.So, unless you're a child, yourself, or an adult who's easily amused by implausible nonsense, then Home Alone's story is just gonna leave you mighty high and dry - 'Cause, hey, other than being completely childish, there sure ain't much joy, merriment, or laughter going on in this one.

66,dee.reid,A Classic Holiday Movie,10,22 December 2000,"Home Alone is probably by far the best holiday comedy movie since Peter Billingsly in A Christmas Story, another holiday classic.The story of Home Alone is about a kid named Kevin McCallister(Macauly Culkin) who with his entire family are, going to France for the holidays. Kevin who is the youngest out of everyone in the house is often called by his brothers and sisters a ""disease.""  Anyway, one night, after his mom orders some pizza, he asks, ""Did anyone order a plain cheese?""  His older brother, Buz replies, ""Yeah, but if you want any, somebody's going to have barf it all up, now it's gone.""  Kevin his angry after discovering that Buz had purposely ate all the cheese pizza and gets into a fight with him.  When it's all over, everyone is mad at Kevin and sent to his room on the top floor for the night.  Later that night before going to sleep he says, ""I wish they would all just disappear.""Predictably, he wakes up the next morning to find everybody gone, not knowing that they had just left for the trip to France.  So this means party time for Kevin.  However, they're have been a string of burglaries by two partners in crime Harry(Joe Pesci) and Marv(Daniel Stern) (by the way are the best comic pair on screen) have set their sights on Kevin's house.  So this ultimately leads to their final showdown with Kevin setting his house full of traps so they can't get in.  As I said before Home Alone is a must see holiday classic.  I'm 15 now.  I first saw it when I was 5 in the theater.  I must have laughed myself silly at Kevin's pranks.  Home Alone was followed by a less successful, but just as entertaining sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost In New York and a horrible third entry, Home Alone 3.  10/10",Home Alone

68,drqshadow-reviews,Fluffy Holiday Mayhem With a Warm Heart,6,26 December 2012,"Basically a live-action Wile E. Coyote / Roadrunner Christmas, with a few humanist subplots thrown in for good measure. John Hughes comedies have often struggled to indulge the author's wackier side without stumbling too far into the realm of slapstick, and Home Alone never really finds that balance. There's a lot of effective material here - the sweet old neighbor's redemption story; Kevin's first steps toward independence; his mother's frantic, airport-skipping quest to get home - but those deeper themes feel too scattered, obvious second (or third) fiddles to the more bombastic third-act fireworks.The production also feels loose and cheap, rife with overdone performances, blunt direction and easy, convenient physical gags. Macaulay Culkin's acting in the lead is borderline unbearable, and the cache of gimmicks and booby traps that fuel his story often asks far too much of the audience. As I mentioned above, growth is a major part of his character arc, but right from the start, most of his word choices and the breadth of his worldly knowledge seems highly suspect for the pampered youngest son of a large, well-off suburban family. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern pick up some slack as a duo of over-amplified burglar stereotypes, played with a wink and a nudge at just the right moments, and Catherine O'Hara shines in a rare straight role as the flustered mother an ocean away from her youngest child.Straightforward and light for the majority of its run time, the film works best when it remembers to pluck the heartstrings with a few season-specific character moments and subplots. Still, it's all too detached from reality, with a strange habit of glorifying and celebrating its frequent scenes of grisly, wince-inducing violence.",Home Alone
69,snoozejonc,Hilarious 'feel good' Christmas family film,8,24 July 2020,"A Chicago family go to Paris for Christmas and accidentally leave their youngest son behind to fend for himself against a pair burglars.When I first saw the trailer for Home Alone, I was curious but unwilling to suspend my disbelief of John Hughes' concept enough to watch it in a movie theatre. After renting the video tape, I regretted my earlier decision because I wholeheartedly accepted what happens to Kevin McCallister. This is partly because everything you are shown in the set up to his predicament is wonderfully cinematic, particularly the family dynamics and all the little moments that connect to things that come later.We then witness Kevin's character steamroll his way through an arc, transforming him from a chaotic and sometimes frightened child, through to responsible homemaker, valued confidant and finally to become the king and defender of his castle. Anyone who questions a child actor's ability to carry a film should take note that Macaulay Culkin with a pitch perfect script proved it can be done spectacularly well.The performances of all cast members playing the McCallister family are brilliant, bouncing off each other wonderfully. Memorable cameos come every other scene with the likes of Ralph Foody, John Candy and other supporting characters adding more layers of humour.The other stars of the film are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as a criminal incarnation of Laurel and Hardy. They have epic screen chemistry and their slapstick sequences, with the help of some fabulous stunt performers, are what make the film something to be treasured and rewatched.John Williams elevates it further with a classic soundtrack that oozes kinetic mayhem, warmth and Christmas spirit.For those interested in production design, Home Alone is a virtual 'how to guide' for a Christmas themed movie on a low budget. Almost every scene and character is a perfectly coordinated shade of red and green.The ending is a bit overly sentimental for my usual liking, but at Christmas who wants anything other than something to make them laugh and smile.",Home Alone
70,MissSimonetta,Nostalgia-proofed holiday classic,8,23 December 2019,"Like many other people of my vintage, HOME ALONE has been a staple of the holidays for as long as I can remember. The story is essentially a kid's fantasy: not just staying home alone and getting to play by one's own rules for a while, but also inflicting comical pain upon very obvious bad guys. The Christmas-y mise en scene and clever use of low camera angles complete this nostalgic, feel-good comedy's sense of festive atmosphere.As an adult, the contrivances that cause the plot to occur are more apparent, of course. And the slapstick climax is shockingly violent-- it never occurred to me just how brain-damaged or DEAD the Wet Bandits would be. However, none of these things bother me in the least. Maybe it's nostalgia. Maybe the movie's strengths are so potent as to cancel anything else out. I don't know. All I know is the movie still makes me laugh in my 20s as much as it did when I was a child.",Home Alone

One reason for me saying this is because I thought the entire cast and crew did a superb job, especially Macaulay Culkin! I loved all the traps that Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) set for Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern). They were absolutely hilarious! I would have done the same thing if there were two bumbling burglars trying to break into my home. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Kids, don't try any of the traps that Kevin set.

73,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Holiday slapstick fun,7,15 December 2015,"Ahh, Christmas. An abandoned child brutally assaults, almost murders two nasty burglars and subjects them to all kinds of elaborate slapstick glory. Such is the joy of Chris Columbis's Home Alone, a seminal holiday classic that contains no message, very little arc, and all the booby trapped hilarity that's more demented than my dad's endless cackling when he sees it on TV for the zillionth time. Don't get me wrong: I enjoy the film, and re watch it whenever I get the chance. It's just pretty demented. Macauley Culkin (back when he was a cute kid before he grew up and looked like something that Dr. Frankenstein made using Steve Buscemi's DNA) plays feisty little Kevin, accidentally left behind at home when his massive dysfunctional family heads off for Christmas vacation. Feeling a bit blue after harsh words with several of his clan, he sets out to live life on his own over the break, which includes shoplifting a toothbrush, eating copious amounts of junk food and the classic prank pizza delivery (ya dirty animal). Things get weird when two scruffy, relentlessly dumb burglars (Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci) set their sights on his home. He takes the phrase 'holding down the fort' terrifyingly seriously, and devises a onslaught of evil traps, gags and medieval style defense tricks that would make the Huns proud. Seriously, I wouldn't wish that tarantula misfortune on anybody. Pesci is grinning glee as the smarter of the two (which isn't saying much) and Stern plays up the banter as the colossal idiot. Catherine O Hara and John Heard play his neurotic parents, John Candy has a puzzling cameo as the undisputed polka king of the Midwest, and Roberts Blossom plays a menacing show shoveller who figures in the plot. Quite the holiday romp. I'm not including the sequels in this series, but I will say: the second one is fun, but stales a bit as it's essentially just a retread of this just in NY and wayy more implausible. I really love the third which is probably my favourite of the series (come fight me). Avoid the 4th and 5th like the plague unless you want to see French Stewart and Malcolm McDowell embarrass their careers terrifically.",Home Alone

Chris Columbus' film, written and produced by John Hughes, is a damn sight more impressive than his directorial debut, ""A Night on the Town"", as he handles all the movie's moods well.

It's about as good as a movie about a kid being left at home and terrorized by burglars could be.McCully Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, the youngest in a family of many children. He is picked on by the older ones and a slip of the tongue gets him in trouble. After a power shortage and a rush to the airport, he is left home alone. To make matters worse, Marv (Joe Pesci) and Harry (Daniel Stern), two police officer burglars, are trying to break into Kevin's house while the family's away. This is a really fun movie. The acting is all around good from paranoid mother Catherine O'Hara to Johny Candy. The situations Kevin is put through are unrealistic, but who really cares, they're funny and clever. McCully Culkin is really good in this actually, considering for much of the film it's a one man show. With the good comes the bad...this movie can get annoying at times. His nonstop screaming in the film gets old, as does his constant looking and talking to the camera.

The film also has a lot of heart, truly Enrapturing a sweet message, and providing such a warm feeling for the spirit of Christmas.

If I were the parents, I think I would have stopped having kids after Buzz was born, what a nasty child!Weirdly, I think the film has some moral content as well as being a laugh-fest of slapstick shenanigans, as Kevin defends his home against two inept burglars and learns to be more mature and not to judge his neighbour based on rumours. He's quite a smart kid and has the potential to be lovely, with his naivety and innocence, if someone would just give him the time of day. He is scared little boy, who does the best in a bad situation, that isn't really his fault.There are some lovely touches included comically and with emotional depth and a clever mind must have come up with the execution of Kevin's plans.The soundtrack is also superb, full of classics and incidental music that has become part of our culture.Could you defend your house in the same situation?",Home Alone

Home Alone is pure family fun and is a hard PG rated movie about a 10 year old kid who is home alone for the holidays because he forgot to go with his family on a flight to New York for family dinner. Mischief ensues as two thieves disguised as repairmen try to steal Kevin's thunder. Macaulay Culkin has his breakthrough moment as Kevin and the cast and crew make it a true classic. During his career, this was John Hughes' biggest movie ever and Chris Columbus produced it long before he made money off of Harry Potter et al. The music by John Williams is classic. The movie became so popular at the box office and at home that a sequel, Lost in New York, came out two years after the first one came out and grossed a bit less than the other one. Then a third one without Culkin came out to diminishing box office returns in 1997 and the fourth and fifth and final movies debuted on home video, with a reboot coming to Disney Plus after Disney bought Fox from the Murdoch family (movie studio and cable entertainment assets) in 2017.",Home Alone

The redundant sequels tried to get the same kind of flow between all the physical gags but I think it's safe to say they just sucked. You can't touch the grand finale of ""Home Alone"". However, I think what comes before all of that is pretty enjoyable too, or at least I used to as a kid. Being home alone, able to do whatever you want, it's not too bad of a Christmas present.

85,mike48128,A John Hughes/Chris Columbus Masterpiece!,9,14 December 2014,"The basic story seems so simple. Little 8-yr. old Kevin is accidentally left behind when his family jets off to Paris for Christmas. So it's ""riddled"" with continuity errors and plot holes. The garage has a separate entrance but is somehow connected to the main house? (Who cares.) There are so many things going on here. It's an incredibly complex screenplay, which pays homage to so many other movies: The burned brass hand-scar (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") The Three Stooges (impossible stunts and injuries that would have killed any mortal man.) ""Angels with Filthy Souls"" is a parody of ""Angels with Dirty Faces"". Clips from several Christmas movies. Sure it's totally implausible that an 8-year-old boy could actually execute such complicated stunts, but the ""Micro-Machines"" (actually candy) are genius, as is the zip line to the treehouse. It's Maculay Culkin's best performance. John Candy plays a great cameo as the Polka King and the sub-plot of ""Old Man Marley"" and his grandchild add much ""heart"" to the film. There are so many scenes that I love, but the toboggan out the front door and the stinging after shave lotion are the best. I love Buzz's tarantula and the blood-curdling scream (dubbed) from Daniel Stern! (The tarantula on Marv's face is considerably smaller than the one used in other scenes?) A great score by John Williams with some dusty 1950's carols thrown in for good measure. Of course this whole thing could never really happen. The whole movie is a fantasy, but the dream house that the McCallister's ""live"" in is real! Also, magically, most of the mess of the house is cleaned up by the time mom is finally united with Kevin, who is no longer home alone.",Home Alone

87,wisewebwoman,An insult both for a child and adult viewer.,4,8 February 2004,"I had never seen this and got the opportunity recently when the child in my life begged to rent it as she had heard wonderful things about it.I expected fluff, a simplistic plot and two hours of enduring the smarmy child actor Macauley Culkin. Not too bad a trade off so that the child would enjoy a movie she wanted to see.Oh dear. Halfway through it I looked at her and said what would you rate this one out of 10? 5, was the response. We are expected to believe that an 8 year old who cannot tie his own shoelaces comes up with incredible booby traps for some burglars who want to rob the house (rigging lines between trees, heating up door knobs to name very few out of many). One with a master's in engineering would not be able to figure out most of them.But the very worst features were these dim-bulb parents who sit in first class while their children go unsupervised in economy on a flight to Paris (9 hours, people!)who cannot fire up a brain cell between them in Paris to get the police, Children's Aid, emergency services (they never have friends and relatives in Hollywoodland)to go to the house and get the child.How hard is it to count your children when you have only three??? The child has not been streetproofed and does not know to call 911 either. And on and on.It is one of the most appalling movies I have ever seen. At the end the child and I agreed, 4 out of 10.The old man (Roberts Blossom) was sweet and Catherine O'Hara, whom I normally admire, is right up there with horror moms of all time.",Home Alone

If it weren't for a few things, I think it would be forgettable, but those things make it work. Those things are Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. Those two made the first film and I guess the sequel fun for me.Home alone from director Chris Columbus, who is super cheesy, directed this film back in 1990. Everyone of his films is cheesy. Home alone for example, is cheesy. I love you Beth Cooper, the worst film of the year, is very cheesy, The first two Harry Potter films are kind of corny, I mean this guy is the king of cheese. He can't help it for some reason.Home alone has some very funny moments. That is another reason why I liked it.

One day, as they are going to France, the accidentally leave Kevin at home. So while Kevin is home alone and the mom travels back to try and get him, these two Burgalers try to break into Kevin's house.

91,Rabical-91,"''Keep the change, you filthy animal!''",10,30 May 2017,"Rising child star Macaulay Culkin first worked with the late screenwriter and producer John Hughes on his 1989 hit 'Uncle Buck' in which he starred alongside the much missed John Candy. Hughes was impressed by the young man's talents and remembered him for when he set about writing his next film which, of course, was 'Home Alone'.Eight year old Kevin McAllister is constantly the butt of his family's jokes, particularly his eldest brother Buzz ( Devin Ratray ). After getting into a fight with Buzz over a pizza the night before their Christmas vacation, Kevin is sent to his room whereupon he wishes that his family would disappear. That night, a huge storm knocks out the power lines meaning that the McAllister's sleep through their alarm. As they leave for the airport in a tearing hurry, they are unaware that Kevin is still in bed fast asleep. The first the family realise of this is when they are halfway to Paris.Kevin is initially overjoyed when he realises that he is home alone but when he learns that two burglars, Harry and Marv, also known as 'the wet bandits', are planning to raid his house on Christmas Eve, he wishes his family would come home. In a bid to protect his home from Harry and Marv, Kevin sets about rigging his house with booby traps to outwit the bad guys. Fortunately, a kindly neighbour ( who is wrongly accused of being a murderer ) who Kevin has befriended is also nearby to help...'Home Alone' is my favourite Christmas romp of all time, excellently delivered by its cast - Devin Ratray as Kevin's troublesome brother Buzz, Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's overwrought parents, Roberts Blossom as Old Man Marley, the old man who came to Kevin's rescue. Full credit however must go to, of course, its star Macaulay Culkin as the cheeky but likable Kevin and the brilliant and underrated Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern ( who in my view was a comedy legend in his own right, as his performances in 'Bushwhacked' and 'City Slickers' will testify ) as the bumbling wet bandits.Also impressive in the short time they are on screen are John Candy as Gus Polinski 'the polka king' and Macaulay Culkin's brother Kieran Culkin who as Kevin's younger ( and weak bladdered ) cousin Fuller ( was he named that because of his regular consumption of fizzy drinks, do you think? ) had me in stitches, especially in the scene in which he is pinned against the wall by a chair.In 1992, a sequel - 'Home Alone 2 - Lost In New York' ( which was the last to feature Macaulay Culkin ) - appeared and did just as well commercially as the first film. Video game versions of both films were also released for both the Sega and Nintendo Consoles. In 1998, 'Home Alone 3' appeared, with Alex D. Linz as Alex Pruddit. It was not as popular as the first two movies but was worth watching nonetheless. Unfortunately in 2002, 'Home Alone 4', which had Mark Weinberg inheriting the role of Kevin McAllister, was made. It was a crushing disappointment for fans of 'Home Alone' and is generally regarded by fans as the worst in the series, a view I share wholeheartedly. Surprisingly, ten years later a fifth film entitled 'Home Alone - The Holiday Heist' was made, this time as a televised film rather than a cinematic release. It fared better than its predecessor though in my eyes nothing will come remotely close to equalling the original.Funniest moment - the fight between Buzz and Kevin over the pizza. I really cannot begin to do the scene justice here but it is a classic moment of comedy, wonderfully delivered by all concerned.Second funniest moment - Harry and Marv continually falling foul to Kevin's various booby traps, each one being more pain inducing than the last!",Home Alone

96,Beta_Gallinger,"Sometimes funny, but how it turned out to be such an incredibly high grossing film is beyond me",6,10 February 2009,"I was a preschooler when this movie came into theatres and turned out to be a massive box office success, but I never saw it in my childhood. I saw a bit of what I guess was the 1992 sequel, ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"", when I was a kid, and was familiar with the ""Screaming Kevin"" doll (a toy which I was never was a big fan of, based on the main character in the first two ""Home Alone"" films, played by Macaulay Culkin), from a very early age. However, believe it or not, it took me a little over eighteen years after the theatrical release of the original ""Home Alone"" for me to get around to seeing it! Yes, this movie is up there on the highest grossing movies of all time lists, but now that I've seen it, I don't know exactly what that was all about.Kevin McCallister is an eight year old boy in Chicago whose family is preparing for their Christmas vacation in France. On the night before the trip, he is picked on by his siblings, and after a dispute with one of them, he is sent to sleep on the third floor, wishing his family would disappear. The next day, the family leaves in a hurry and Kevin is accidentally left behind! He wakes up to find that his family actually has disappeared, and his parents don't realize they've forgotten their son back at home until one point during their flight! At first, Kevin is happy that the family is gone, but eventually finds that being home alone isn't all that easy. While his mother, Kate, tries desperately to get back home as quickly as possible, which doesn't turn out to be easy, Kevin becomes aware of two burglars who intend to rob the McCallister house! For a while, early in the film, I didn't find it very funny at all. Before the trip, there's a joke about armpit shaving (jokes like this, along with some language, are the obvious reasons for the PG rating), and one of the McCallister siblings throws up. I did not care for these, and some of the sibling rivalry and insults I found to be a bit much. For a while after Kevin first finds himself home alone, I found the film rather dull, but fortunately, funnier parts come. There are some humorous moments involving Kevin without his family, such as the character at the store, with the question he asks about a certain toothbrush, and I laughed hard during the scenes where he uses the movie to communicate with people at the door, convincing them there are adults inside (they're probably the funniest parts). The McCallister mother can also be somewhat amusing during her attempts to quickly get back home. Casting comedienne Catherine O'Hara in this role definitely helped. The climax can be funny, but gets a little tiresome.I've definitely seen much worse comedies than this hit holiday film from 1990, and this one is funnier than 1994's ""The Santa Clause"", another PG rated family Christmas movie from the 90's, which I seemed to enjoy as a kid, but not during my last viewing many years later. Despite the absurd plot, ""Home Alone"" does have some good humour, as well as a rather poignant moment in the church which eventually comes, but still, the film is not all it's cracked up to be. It may be slightly above average family fare, and it has appeal, but it's still a little strange, the fact it's among the tops in box office history. I'm sure there are so many movies which have been much more deserving of the success that ""Home Alone"" had at the box office, but unfortunately didn't even come close.",Home Alone
97,vip_ebriega,The Ideal Holiday Family Movie.,7,4 May 2007,"My Take: Not a holiday classic in the lines of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, but a mild classic all its own. Ever since I watched it since I was a kid until now, that I'm a big movie fan, ""Home Alone"" is still a very hilarious and effective comedy. It may not just be up there among the highest-grossing films of all time, but also among the funniest films ever. It's fast with the laughs, yet still not ignoring the family values, which the film must have. The story is very memorable and fresh, and always worth a look. Little Macaulay Culkin delivers all he can in his performance as Kevin. While Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are fantastically appealing as the two burglars who gets into sticky situations when they underestimate the power of a little eight-year old.For those who haven't watched it yet (which is very doubtful), goo watch it now. For those who've seen it several times (like me), go watch it again, this time, with the entire family. Honestly it doesn't disappoint.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Home Alone
98,jhclues,An Anomaly of the Genre,6,18 December 2001,"Take a cheeky eight-year-old, put him in a situation he has to slapstick his way out of with the kind of antics most cartoon characters wouldn't survive, and what you have is one of the most wildly popular, commercially successful comedies of all time.  And when it's over, though most likely you'll have had a good time, you'll be tempted to ask the question:  Why? Because `Home Alone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written by John Hughes, is mediocre at best, though it does have it's moments.  It's a matter of the filmmakers being very astute, perhaps, and wisely mixing in a potpourri of elements with universal appeal and touching upon that common nerve they calculated would give just about anyone in the audience something to which they could relate.  And they were right.  Kids, Christmas, family, vacation, independence, a scary situation; it's all in here.  But, interestingly enough, it lacks the sentimental value that would seemingly have made this a movie one could truly embrace.  As it is, it's engaging fare, but somehow manages to keep the viewer at arm's length.  Then again, maybe that's even part of the appeal; it may be that audiences at this particular time and place were more comfortable just watching without having to invest anything of themselves in order to have a good time.	This was, after all, 1990, and this film played to a generation weaned on more than a decade of Saturday Night Live, whose keen sense of biting satire and parody definitely had an influence on the mind-set of audiences everywhere.  And is that a bad thing?  No, absolutely not.  It merely points up one possible reason why a film centered around an eight-year-old with a somewhat derisive attitude could be so wholeheartedly received.  Also, it may be that the second half of the film, with it's over-the-top slapstick, is what made the final impression on the audience.  And this IS funny stuff; and it's going to get to even those who usually prefer humor that doesn't involve slapstick, because it's so well done.  Again, credit the filmmakers with having their fingers on the pulse of our culture and standards at the time.  But you also have to give credit to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who bring the `Wet Bandits,' Harry and Marv,  to life, and know how to put across this kind of comedy, which is no easy task.	The story itself is simple:  The extended McCallister family sets off for a Christmas vacation in Paris, and inadvertently, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) gets left behind.  Left alone.  At home.  Where, rising to the occasion beyond anything even the most prodigious teenager could manage, he discovers the thrill of being independent and thwarts a pair of bungling burglars in the balance.  Meanwhile, mom and dad (Catherine O'Hara as Kate, John Heard as Peter) go out of their minds when they get to Paris and discover what has happened.  If only they knew what an ingenious and imaginative son they had...	Culkin is certainly a cute kid, but can he act?  Well, the jury is still out on that one.  It's hard to say, since the dialogue he is given is so ridiculously above that of an eight-year-old, and the situations he encounters are so far-fetched, that there is no real frame of reference by which to consider it objectively.  His timing and rhythm are lacking, however, that much is clear.  His responses-- or, if you will, the punch lines he delivers-- are always a beat behind what they should be.  And it robs the humor of the spontaneity that would have made it funnier, even hilarious.  As it is, the only real laughs come from Kevin's assault on the Wet Bandits, and there are plenty to be had there.	Pesci and Stern become the real stars of the show as they play out their slapstick antics, which are truly deserving of the laughs they generate. Their expressions of incredulity in the face of the violence that is visited upon them is what makes this movie.  Everything else merely sets the stage for Harry and Marv's descent into the maelstrom.  And what Pesci and Stern do here should not be taken for granted, nor taken lightly artistically.  To put this kind of humor across takes some real talent on the part of consummate professionals, and Pesci and Stern certainly deliver it.  Their secret?  They play it straight, which keeps the silliness out of it.  Had they played it strictly as farce, it simply wouldn't have had the same impact; but by playing to the characters in the situation, rather than to a situation involving characters, it works.  And, once again, chalk up another one for Columbus and Hughes, who really know how to deliver this kind of material.	The only truly poignant moment in the film involves Kevin's encounter with a mysterious neighbor, `Old Man Marley,' played wonderfully by character actor/poet Roberts Blossom.  The revelation of his secret earlier in the film sets up the purest moment of the ending, and though it is brief, it's inspired and adds a much needed perspective to the story.	The supporting cast includes Devin Ratray (Buzz), Angela Goethals (Linnie), Gerry Bamman (Uncle Frank), Hillary Wolf (Aunt Leslie), Ralph Foody (Gangster Johnny), Billie Bird (Irene), Bill Erwin (Ed) and John Candy, memorable in the role of Gus Polinski, the Polka Band shuttle Chief. Considering the ratio between this movie's substance and the success it still enjoys today, `Home Alone' is something of an anomaly in the history of the genre.  it lacks insight, yet delivers some real belly laughs.  It lacks a single character the audience can truly embrace, yet is accepted overwhelmingly as is.  It lacks inspiration, yet is an inspired film in the way it is crafted and delivered.  It's one you're probably going to like and enjoy, but upon reflection may wonder, `Why.'  And the answer?  Who can say. Go figure.  It's the magic of the movies.  6/10.",Home Alone

103,Atreyu_II,Surreal and hilarious,7,20 August 2007,"""Home Alone"" is one of the most popular movies from the early 90's. Its success was phenomenal and it also made Macaulay Culkin a superstar.The plot is quite original and surreal: a child who is home alone and capable of making the bandits's lives miserable? Sure, it's an impossible story, but who cares? Far from being a perfect movie, it is however okay and fun to watch, entertaining and contains slapstick humor too although I don't like some of the language used. Our story takes place in Chicago at Christmas time, which makes this a Christmas film. In fact, the movie has lots of Christmas decorations, lights, snow and many other details which create the feeling and magic so characteristic of Christmas. To accent the Christmas atmosphere even more, there are a cup of nice Christmas carols such as ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" (performed by Brenda Lee), ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch"", ""White Christmas"", ""Carol of the Bells"", ""Oh Holly Night"" and ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" and some brilliant instrumental musics.Kevin McCallister is the hero of the story. He's not just any kid, he's a very smart one. He also knows all about the intentions of the ""wet bandits"" Harry and Marv and prepares them lots of unexpected ""surprises"". Their lives won't be easy with Kevin defending his house. Sure, they are the villains and as such they get what they deserve, but they do suffer a lot too. We almost feel sorry for them.The ""wet bandits"" were nicknamed like that by Marv because their ""calling card"" (according to him) was to let the water running in every houses they robbed. That said, both ""wet bandits"" are hilarious. Harry is more cranky, while Marv is the most stupid of the two (although both are stupid) and maybe that's why people tend to sympathize more with him. Marv's stupidity also makes him the funniest of the two. Marv is the typical tall and clumsy guy with no brain, a bit like Averell Dalton from the Lucky Luke comics.The movie has lots of funny moments. The funniest for me is when Harry and Marv pretend to be Santa Claus and his elf and the way Harry speaks in that scene, followed by the even funnier part when Kevin fires at Harry's pants. Whenever Kevin fools the bandits in a try to make them believe the whole family is at home when Kevin is all alone is funny too. For some reason, I also find funny whenever Kevin screams maniacally (particularly when he says he's not afraid anymore and sees Old Marley and screams out loud.The scenes which Kevin fools and scares the Little Nero's Pizza boy and Marv with the gangster film ""Angels with Filthy Souls"" are hilarious, but in the case of the Pizza boy it is unfair for him. There was no need to scare the hell out of him - he was just delivering pizza and wasn't after Kevin.Old Marley is an interesting character. I always felt sorry for him because of the lies Buzz tells about him. And the man never did anything bad to anyone. Buzz is a jerk and Uncle Frank is even worse. Buzz is mean for Kevin and Uncle Frank openly dislikes Kevin. When Uncle Frank tells Kevin «Look what you did, you little jerk!», Kevin's parents should tell him something like «Frank, stay out of this and shut up!».The church is magnificent. It's one of the biggest and most beautiful churches I've ever seen in a movie. Macaulay Culkin is terrific as the clever kid Kevin McCallister. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are awesome as the ""wet bandits"" and Roberts Blossom is great as the character Old Marley. It's also delightful to see John Candy as Gus Polinski, the «Polka King of the Midwest».",Home Alone

While the family go away for the holidays, Kevin accidentally gets left behind, and he becomes the hero of the film by protecting his house against a couple of idiotic bandits. The film is filled with slapstick humour which will leave you laughing hysterically. There's also some subplots which will leave you nice and warm for the holidays.

I didn't see this because I was 3 at the time (and I didn't watch movies in a theater until 1991), but I have seen this on TV every year and I used to watch the DVD and VHS versions of this! And yes, they are all great! And so are things like using a fake movie to scare pizza delivery guys and burglars away, using train sets with sticks and cardboard people and loud music to fool people into think that there's a party going on, and more! ""Home Alone"" is, in fact, one of the greatest holiday movies ever made. What else is there to say?",Home Alone
111,Min111,From one big family to home alone,10,18 December 2019,"What a fantastic movie Home Alone was. Home Alone is a really good Christmas and family movie, and it's one of the favourites for many people. It's an all-time classic! Home Alone was made on the year I was born, so it makes it extra special for me to see. It's a movie which everyone can like.Many, like myself, watched it several times over the years, yet still can't get enough of it. There's something about Home Alone which I just don't know. This is a movie where Kevin is forgotten by his family, and is left all alone in his home.I just like how Kevin is responsible for things. He does take charge despite being on his own. He went shopping on his own. Yes, Kevin is right. That curious girl at the cash register is indeed a ""stranger"". I liked how Kevin used coupons to pay.Kevin also wanted to buy a toothbrush. Kevin really wanted to pay for it, but he was scared of this man that's from his street. Kevin felt bad afterwards. It was funny though how he got away from the cop. Home Alone is also a comedy movie, so you shouldn't be surprised that it was also funny.But little does he realise that there are a few bad guys that likes to call themselves (or at least one of them) as ""The Wet Bandits"". They seek to burgle a lot of the homes within Kevin's neighbourhood. Now they're after Kevin's home. Can Kevin stop them? You need to see it to find out.Kevin has to protect his home, and he also has to protect himself from these burglars and intruders. He's only a boy, so the odds are against it.What made this movie succeed is largely down to Kevin. I don't think any other child could've played it any better. Don't you think so? Kevin is the sole reason the movie is popular. I like that popular boy. I like the other characters such as Buzz. They also played a part, but they only have minor roles. Frank and Kevin don't seem to like each other. Frank is Kevin's uncle by the way. I don't like his uncle either.One of my favourite parts about Kevin is the pizza delivery scene where Kevin says: ""A lovely 'cheese pizza' just for me"". That's one of many great lines found within this Home Alone movie. The family really like to eat their pizzas as you can see at the beginning. They ordered a lot of pizzas. It's a big family. I also like the pizza delivery guy. You should've seen him run afterwards. It was hilarious! I also like how Kevin devises a plan to set-up booby traps for these intruders. He knows his home pretty well.I know Kevin's house is huge, but I always wondered how many doors he exactly had from the outside into his house. I always wanted to live in a wonderful house like that. I like Kevin's attic.Due to the success of Home Alone, many movies have soon followed, but only one of them can rightly claim to match it, and that's Home Alone 2. Kevin is set for an exciting adventure.",Home Alone
112,Peach-2,Good family film.,8,20 December 1998,"Home Alone is a good family film. I enjoyed it. I saw the film with about 500 young children and it was an overwhelming experience. Although I didn't think the film was as funny as they did, I had a great time listening to them laugh. Kids will laugh more than adults will, but I think that's what this film is aiming to do.",Home Alone
113,Imdbidia,A classic that doesn't lose gas,8,5 January 2017,"This has become one of my favorite Christmas films over the years.This is a classic that has everything to please children and adults: with a killer mix of adventure, comedy, melodrama and embedded moral. The main thing, to me, is that the Christmas spirit is there, so the rest just clicks into the puzzle easily. The movie is predictable, of course, but that is part of the charm you expect from a Christmas story, unless you are watching an horror movie or a proper adult comedy.I loved Macauly Culkin when he was a child. He is brilliant in this movie. He fuses with his character in a way that is difficult to separate the two, showing the great actor he was even at that age. The Good Son would would highlight his maturity as actor, so he is not a pretty face here. Macauly and his character Kevin looks angelical but is far from being an angel; he has a good heart, has an insight into what is good and bad, is ready to be advised by wise people; at the same time, Kevin is also creatively ruthless with the baddies because, well, they brought it upon them and deserve it. Despite Kevin being alone, this is a choral movie. It wouldn't have been the success it was if it wasn't because the performances of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, who are brilliant as the mischievous yet naive baddies. Daniel Stern is especially funny, and has one of the best on-screen yells in movie history. I don't want to forget John Candy's secondary role in this movie, who is deadpan funny in one of those garrulous characters that were one of his trademarks. Roberts Blossom is also great as the lonely grumpy old neighbor. The rest of actors were believable in their respective characters as well.Home Alone warms my heart and cheers me up every time.",Home Alone

Whilst being home alone, Kevin has to protect his home from a pair of burglars named Harry and Marv.This is a very special film to me and most likely to a lot of people. I remember watching this in school and at home all the time as a child. It's one of those films that I could watch on loop without ever getting bored and it's one of my favourites to watch during the Christmas season.The script by John Hughes is as hilarious as it is heartwarming. There is so much fun to be had with a concept like this and, sure enough, it's hilarious but Hughes balances out the humour with scenes that warm your heart as we see Kevin's character develop when he begins to understand the importance of family. To be fair, you do have to suspend your disbelief with the cartoonish violence and corny nature of the film but those aspects don't really bother me because of the amount of fun I have watching Home Alone.It's not an easy job to carry a film especially for a child but Macaulay Culkin manages it with ease. He makes Kevin so likeable and we root for him the entire time. It's a great child performance. The best part of the film are the burglars played exceptionally well by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. These two make this film a laugh riot and their chemistry with one another is simply magical. Pesci and Stern are so entertaining to watch that there's no way I'll ever forget their characters.I don't think I'll ever forget Home Alone. It had such a big impact on my childhood and it's one of those feel-good movies that puts a smile on my face each time I watch it. It's perfect for Christmas and one which the whole family can enjoy.",Home Alone

I feel like all the main actors are really good in this and the two robbers still make me laugh after all these years.

124,jhaggardjr,Terrific comedy,8,2 December 2001,"""Home Alone"" went on the become a box office sensation when first released in late 1990. It stayed at the top of the box office as the #1 film for its first 12 weeks of release. Quite impressive. Kids of all ages just loved this movie about a little 8-year-old boy who gets accidentally left home all by himself after his family rushes off to spend Christmas in France. Macaulay Culkin is terrific as Kevin, the boy left home alone. He pretty much is the whole show here. His charisma and presence help make ""Home Alone"" as good as it is. However, this movie is not a classic. If it wasn't for the ridiculously crazy climax this movie would have been better. Of course the climax is the part that made everybody laugh out loud, when the kid takes on those inept burglars by setting up booby traps that are just too far-fetched to be believable. This part still makes me laugh, but I just can't believe that an 8-year-old could dream up of stuff like that. And writer-producer John Hughes would inject this style of slapstick humor into alot of his following movies (including ""Baby's Day Out"", ""Curly Sue"", and of course the two ""Home Alone"" sequels). The slapstick violence is at times a bit too much, but it doesn't go too far (though the first sequel ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" did get more violent in its slapstick comedy). Director Chris Columbus had his first smash hit with ""Home Alone"". He followed this with ""Home Alone 2"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", and most recently ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"". Columbus knows that he can work beautifully with kids, and ""Home Alone"" is where he got his start. He makes Culkin look as good as he is. The supporting cast is fine (Catherine O'Hara and John Heard are good as Culkin's parents; Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are wonderfully bumbling as the clumsy burglars), and Hughes script has some wonderfully heartfelt touches. ""Home Alone"" may not be the best comedy movie ever made, but it's still a good one. I'll take ""Home Alone"" over Hughes idiotic ""Baby's Day Out"" anytime.*** (out of four)",Home Alone
125,baileycrawly,Christmas Classic,8,13 September 2020,"Home Alone is really the movie that refuses to die. It's a guarantee that, from November 1 to December 25, no matter where you live in the world, there's always a channel airing this movie. It's earned the disdain of some (as a result of overexposure) and the delight of others, particularly child star Macaulay Culkin, for whom this film is still a steady source of guaranteed income.There's just something about Home Alone that makes it particularly special. It has a color palette that just feels like Christmas, with a score that has everything you need for the quintessential ""sound"" of Christmas.Macaulay Culkin brilliantly carries this film as young Kevin McCallister in a performance that will forever be regarded as one of the best from a child actor. After wishing his parents would ""just disappear,"" Kevin wakes up to find that, in the hustle of getting to the airport for their vacation on time after sleeping in, he was left behind. Now the ""man of the house,"" Kevin needs to protect the house and survive on his own. Of course, being a slapstick comedy, hijinks (in the form of Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci) ensue.One thing Home Alone does really well is deliver a ton of heart. Culkin knows exactly what is needed to pull off the emotional power of the scenes. You can watch this film and genuinely feel the loneliness and desire he has to be with his family; the regret he feels for the things he said to them. And, as Christmas day gets closer and the family does all they can to get home with him, you can't help but get a tear in your eye.It's one of those rare, perfectly-balanced movies that can make you laugh, cry and feel uplifted all at once, and with an impressive supporting cast around Culkin. There's definitely a reason why this film is so highly regarded, and it's one that will outlive all of us. Truly, a timeless Christmas classic.",Home Alone
126,DavidSim240183,An interesting idea amusingly played out,8,12 October 2007,"Home Alone was the top money-spinner of 1990 and thrust Chris Columbus to the A-list of Hollywood's filmmakers. I'm not exactly an enormous fan of Columbus because there is something sickeningly twee that seems to infect just about everything he gets his hands on. Home Alone is one of his more successful endeavours, although I tend to think that's more to John Hughes' screenplay which is full of tiny amusements rather than anything on Columbus' part.After all, this is not the first time Hughes has tackled the nightmares of holiday travel. He previously directed the quite wonderful Thanksgiving comedy Planes, Trains & Automobiles. He got a tremendous amount of mileage from what could have been a thinly plotted scenario, and enlivened the film through rich, nuanced performances from Steve Martin and John Candy. A film of equal heart and humour. A true, comedy classic.Home Alone is not quite as successful. If it had been directed by the sure hand of John Hughes instead of the simplistically banal hand of Chris Columbus, it might have elevated the film's premise to classic status. Instead, its a film of amusing diversions and interesting ideas trying to get out. But when they do, Home Alone is a very good film indeed.We really don't need to go into specifics about the plot. Home Alone had such an impact on people the world over its entered the English language. Indeed its the intriguing concept at the heart of the film that drew so many people to it in the first place. An eight year old boy, Kevin McCallister is left at home by his neglectful parents during the Christmas holidays.While they're in Paris, Kevin has free reign of the McCallister house. That must be the dream of any child. The freedom to do whatever they want. Whenever they want. No parents to hold them back. Or discipline them when they step out of line. The whole film rests on little Macaulay Culkin's shoulders. And he does quite well too.I don't think Culkin is all that much of an actor. After all he peaked at a very young age, and his career went into steady decline after that. But his obnoxious precocity wasn't quite as pronounced here. There was still a little bit of innocence left in the boy, which is what gives the film its conviction. Without it, Home Alone wouldn't work.Which is exactly the reason why Home Alone 2 didn't work. By that time, Culkin was 12 years old and his child-like innocence had long since left him. His ego had thoroughly taken over, and the film seemed a much more calculated attempt on Columbus' part to replicate the things that made the first film work so well.Hughes' quite well written screenplay puts Kevin through his paces. I enjoyed watching the shifts in little Kevin's emotions. First off is Kevin's astonishment. He wished for his family to disappear, and so they did. Well they've only gone on holiday, but to a child's mind it could seem like wish fulfilment. This leads to unbridled joy at living life on his own terms.But gradually the reality of his situation begins to sink in. This leads to loneliness, fear, and eventually horror when the McCallister mansion is targeted by two dimwitted burglars, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern).The point where Kevin must defend his home by outfitting it with booby traps from top to bottom provides one of the best sustained 15 minutes of comedy you'll ever see. I did find it hard to swallow that Kevin could come up with so many different booby traps from blowtorches to tripwires and even Micro Machines. Especially with only an hour to work with. But Columbus directs these scenes with such breathless energy it will have you laughing harder than anything else in the film.There are some smaller pleasures to be found elsewhere. The film adds an external character of a snow shoveller Kevin believes to be a mass murderer. But in a nicely written scene, he turns out to be a lonely man estranged from his family. I like this scene because it very nicely sums up Kevin's predicament. What started out as an answer to his prayers is beginning to feel more and more like a punishment. Being alone can be fun for awhile. But eventually we want it to end. Its a very overlooked scene.I also liked the scenes with Kevin's mother, played by Catherine O'Hara. Her desperately trying to get home to Kevin is pleasantly reminiscent of Planes, Trains & Automobiles. All the more so because she even ends up travelling with John Candy along the way. He plays a character not all that far removed from Del Griffith, and the interplay between the two feels natural and warm. Like PTA, Candy proves to be O'Hara's ticket home.Home Alone has its flaws here and there. But it is a reasonably polished film, and it makes you laugh at all of the right moments. It's not quite the holiday classic Planes, Trains & Automobiles was, but you're bound to find something fun about it, and kids will most definitely love it. Since they're the intended target audience, Home Alone has accomplished what it set out to do. You really couldn't ask for anything more.",Home Alone

129,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,11 January 2005,"Easily the best Christmas movie for kids growing up in the eighties and nineties, and deserves to be mentioned along side the classics from previous decades. For kids, the movie has everything- action, excitement, humour, and for everyone else the story and acting are engaging. The idea of being left Home Alone for a while, especially after your relatives have been so annoying, will appeal to kids as they will have peace to do anything they want and let their imaginations fly. Cue lots of ice cream and sled rides down stairs. The film shows depth by letting us see the initial down side to being alone- the house can be scary when it gets dark, and you know your parents are not there to help. The plot sees the massive Macallister (spelling?) family planning to go on holiday for Christmas. After a pizza incident at the dinner table, young Kevin is sent to bed and locked in. The next morning there is a rush, and the family leave for the airport without Kevin, only realising what has happened when they are on the plane. They try to find a way home, but this is not easy as it's Chritmas. Meanwhile, two crooks plan to rob the Macallister house, knowing it's empty, but soon realise that Kevin is inside. Kevin sees that it is up to him to protect his house, and begins setting up traps for the intruders. What follows is great entertainment. Yes it may be soppy, but it is a family Christmas film. It is much smarter than you may think, probably accounting for much of its great success, and the acting, particularly from Culkin and Pesci, is impressive. The set pieces are ingenious, ensuring that every 10 year old boy will come up with their own ways to stop bad guys. O'Hara is also good while the rest of the cast, in small roles do well. 8 out of 10",Home Alone

134,thebricks,"Great movie, but kind of stupid if you watch as an adult",7,28 December 2019,"Very enjoyable movie that plays on every kid's worst fears of getting robbed, especially while you're at home. The real truth is, most robbers will usually run if they see anyone is home. It's not worth the kidnapping and murder charges carrying out the robbery. Also, in a neighborhood like this, someone is most certainly going to be nosy and call the cops if they see anything unusual happen.I used to think Kevin defending his home as a kid was a matter of life or death. In truth, I didn't realize how much money his mom was paying for that trip. Flying a group of family members to Paris, four in first class at early nineties prices is a ton of cash, plus hotel rooms and excursions. Someone like that would probably use robbery as an excuse to renovate their mansion.Factoring in how expensive it would have been to fix the house, some estimates put it at $220K, Kevin probably would have been better off opening the door and letting them take what they wanted.But it's a fun movie for kids, so I'll leave it at that.",Home Alone

136,Brian-272,A holiday classic!,8,26 December 2000,"This film is one of the all-time great holiday films, probably ranking a distant second behind A Christmas Story. I remember when ten years ago I saw Home Alone at the theater I said you have a instant classic. I guess my prediction was right, I know when I hear many people talk about a film for years that the popularity is overwhelming and also it must have sent a good message to people. Home Alone continues to get many airings just the other day I watched this classic on HBO. The ingredients for success in the form of the writing from John Hughes really made this film so enjoyable, and you know how good John Hughes delivers a sweet and likeable film. The story is crazy but also funny as Macaulay Culkin as a precarious 8-year-old who accidentally is left behind by his vacationing family, in the meantime Culkin must battle a twosome of goofy and inept burglars wonderfully depicted by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. I must say that Joe Pesci is a great actor not only is he seriously funny but he is just plain and simply the best at anything he does! Qualify Pesci as a very underrated actor. And Culkin enjoys the adventure of a lifetime filled with many laughs and giggles to crack you up! It just goes to show you many times an individual can have the most fun when left alone. No matter how many times you have seen Home Alone watch this classic every holiday season it's a film to enjoy for a lifetime.",Home Alone
137,renegadeviking-271-528568,Home Alone Review,5,4 January 2021,"It is easy to understand why Home Alone is one of the most popular Christmas movies! It has a lot of laughs, some touching moments, a couple of villains, and an adorable/annoying child as the star of the show. If a family comedy is what you want, then you can't get much better than Home Alone!Plot SummaryThe McCallister family is preparing to go to Paris for Christmas. The night before they leave, Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is having trouble with his cousins and siblings, but it ends up with him being sent to the attic as a punishment. Overnight, the power lines become damaged, which affect the alarm clocks, causing the family to oversleep. In the chaos to get to the airport on time, Kevin is left behind.With the house to himself, Kevin has a great time and does whatever he wants! He does however become scared by his neighbour ""Old Man Marley"" (Roberts Blossom) who is rumoured to be a serial killer. Kevin is also worried about the ""Wet Bandits"" aka Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) who try to break into his house. Kevin manages to make them think the family is home, averting the danger for the moment!Meanwhile, the McCallister family eventually realize Kevin was missing, and mum Kate (Catherine O'Hara) attempts to get back home. She manages to get a flight back to the US, but she still has to get back to Chicago!On Christmas Eve Kevin goes to church where he meets Old Man Marley. He realises he's not scary or a murderer at all, and Kevin helps encourage him to reconcile with his family.By now, Harry and Marv have figured out Kevin is alone, and plan to break into the house. Kevin overhears their plans so creates his own plan. He places traps all over the house, so when Harry and Marv break in they get a lot more than they bargained for! Kevin phones the police and tries to lure Harry and Marv to another house, but they manage to catch up with Kevin. All ends well however as Kevin's new friend Marley rescues him.On Christmas Day, the rest of the McAllister family return, where Kevin has a little bit of explaining to do...ThoughtsI had heard a lot about the film from when I was younger, but somehow I only got around to watching it a few years ago! I can't believe it took me so long to see it as I can imagine loving it as a child (and I love it even now). Sometimes the booby traps and accidents can seem to go on a bit and feel tedious, but for me this was more of a problem in Home Alone 2.Kevin/Macaulay Culkin is of course the star of the show, and you can't help but like him! He gets to do all the fun stuff that every child wants to do when they're left on their own, until the burglars come anyway...The film isn't perfect. For example, I wasn't much of a fan of the scenes with John Candy when his band helped get Kate back home. I just wanted to get back to Kevin and the rest of the action!Favourite SceneI picked the equivalent in Home Alone 2, but this scene is just iconic! The confusion of the pizza guy and the delight of Kevin was amazing to watch!Favorite CharacterIt can only really be Kevin can't it? He is the undisputed star of the show, and I especially love him when he acts almost grown up, like when he went shopping (and shoplifting).Favourite QuoteMegan McAllister: You're not at all worried that something might happen to Kevin?Buzz McAllister: No, for 3 reasons: A, I'm not that lucky. 2, We use smoke detectors. And D, we live on the most boring street in the whole United States of America, where nothing even remotely dangerous will ever happen. Period.Kevin: Is this toothbrush approved by the American Dental Association?Final ThoughtsOverall this is the perfect family film for those wanting a laugh over Christmas, or any other time of the year! There is definitely plenty to laugh at, and although not everyone will love it, I'm sure most would at least enjoy it!",Home Alone

139,ReelCheese,Does It Deserve Its Popularity?,4,11 August 2006,"Everybody tries hard, but ""Home Alone"" doesn't work nearly as well as its popularity suggests. Macaulay Culkin became a household name starring as Kevin McCallister, a precocious eight-year-old accidentally left behind when his family heads out on a holiday vacation. If fending for himself weren't enough, Kevin must also contend with two bumbling burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern), who have targeted the family home.I first saw ""Home Alone"" when I was 10 years old. I didn't find it at all funny then, and its genius still eludes me. The alleged ""humor"" that everyone seems to love stems mainly from a series of violent booby traps Kevin sets up to stop the bad guys. Among the deterrents the burglars so wittingly fall for is a red-hot doorknob. Looks painful, but hardly funny. The film tries to handle such physical abuse like an old Road Runner cartoon, but when the action involves real people instead of an animated coyote, something is lost.Yet ""Home Alone"" isn't a total disaster. The performances are great and the story is at times quite charming, particularly the subplot involving the supposedly scary old neighborhood man. Interestingly, the sequel -- ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" -- marked a notable improvement.",Home Alone

McCauley Caulkin displays great talent for his age as the child trying to defend his home from two dopey burglars, played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci. Pesci has never been funnier as a competitive burglar who can't believe that he is being beaten by a kid. Pesci and Stern end up making complete fools of themselves. Caulkin's parents are played by John Heard and Catherine O'Hara. They are both funny as different personality parents, who completely forget their son on a holiday trip. There is also an amusing scene with John Candy as a polka clarinetist. I liked the part where Caulkin helped out his neighbor by advising him to contact his estranged son. All and all a delightful children film - up there with A Christmas Story and Dennis the Menace. P.S. - one flaw. A lot of characters were speaking in a definite New York accent.

Excellent Christmas movie and masterpiece by Chris Columbus.Excellent movie, I loved the performance of Macaulay Culkin the best, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern also, the best performance of all, I wonder what happened to Macaulay Culkin ? Home Alone is a movie to see as a family, a movie to watch at Christmas. I loved. 10 points. And the man with the excellent shovel. As I said the best performance of all, the part that Kevin puts the tarantula to the thief Marv (Daniel Stern) killed me with laughter and the face that Joe Pesci puts on when he leaves in the police car made me laugh. Safety pin. Very recommended. I suppose everyone saw it, the one who did not see it, I recommend it, you can see it. It is a film suitable for all audiences. The McCalister family goes on vacation to France, they leave Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) alone at home, Kevin learns to fend for himself and even protect himself, cheat him and confront some thieves who come to Harry's house (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) are two thieves who intend to raid all the closed houses in their neighborhood.

144,Jerique,Better than Ebert thinks...,8,7 April 2011,"Home Alone is a nostalgic film for me, having watched it religiously when I was a young kid growing up. Roger Ebert gave this film a 2.5 out of 4. He calls the film unrealistic and says that it goes in another direction from the original premise.Home Alone plays on the scary scenario every kid fears at some point in their life. Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is forgotten at home in Chicago when his family rushes off to the airport for their trip to Paris. Soon after, Kevin is visited by home invaders Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci) and it's up to him to stop them.Ebert complains that this film deviates from the main premise and simply brings in stunt doubles and fills the film with wacky traps that would otherwise cost the McCallister's tens of thousands of dollars to accomplish what Kevin does. While this is not far from the true, you're supposed to suspend some disbelief when watching this.I enjoy Home Alone because an 8-year old handles two grown up burglars. I don't enjoy watching people getting hurt, but I think in this case, there is an exception. The moral of the story is that even when you're young, you can still be responsible and handle your home from being invaded. It shows that it's wrong to rob people and that even children can be heroes.However, I find that the sequel is much better than this and it's due to the far superior story setup. Kevin being left home alone was a great initial start and opening up to the opportunity of a follow up story.To review this film without the mention of Macaulay's acting is a crime. Macaulay portrays Kevin with amazing talent and it's great for the simple fact that the 90s weren't really big for their child actors as far as I can remember. Macaulay is able to hit all ends of the acting spectrum showing being scared, showing emotion, and showing confidence and hilarious comedic relief, too. He was a great actor and I was sad to only see a few of his films before he retired.Another great point about Home Alone being a cult classic is the musical score provided by legendary John Williams. He gives the film the final emotional touch that allows us to forever remember Home Alone as being a classic film and never forget Macaulay's performance. Somewhere in My Memory has always been a favourite track of mine by Williams and it's just a great piece of music on top of a great film.This film is a classic for me, and I would never say that this isn't a wonderful film, despite being a tad bit unrealistic. But, the fact is, most films exaggerate and force you to suspend disbelief. Don't allow for this film not to be a favourite because you don't think this sort of thing could happen.",Home Alone
145,illbebackreviews,One of the Better Comedies of the 90's,9,3 January 2012,"'Home Alone' is a Christmas classic about a young boy named Kevin McCallister who is accidentally left behind during the chaos on a trip. He then realizes that two burglars are about to break in and so he must defend himself.Why on earth is this movie so lowly rated!?! 7.3 on IMDb for this film is simply said, not high enough. C'mon this is a Christmas classic and is widely regarded by many as the 2nd greatest X-Mas movie. This film has heart, fun and absurdity.I first watched this movie 6 years ago, when I was back in the 4th grade, not only did I cry and laugh my head off, but so did EVERYONE in our class. We, as a class, had a blast and even today (when I just watched it) I love the film. There are so many things I love about this film. I love EVERY single actor, even the little kids who don't get very much screen-time. That's how good the acting is, in particular little Macaulay Culkin, perhaps the greatest kid actor before he became drug addict. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were the perfect burglar pair! That was just perfect! I loved how this film had heart, like when the band offered to drive Kevin's mom all the way home, saying ""Sure, its Christmas time!"" I also absolutely loved the hell outta Old Man Marley and the character background story they gave him. I also loved how he looks evil but deep down you see him as a nice character. Perfect film!",Home Alone

Two crooks attempt to rob the family home, and it is up to Kevin to protect the place! Home Alone is one of my all time favourite Christmas movies, I couldn't get enough of it as a kid growing up. There was something powerful as a child seeing another child around the same age face the bad guys and be able to defeat them. Home Alone is basically about a family that leaves for vacation, but in the rush of getting out on time they forget that young Kevin McCallister was not with them on their way to the airport. So while they take off for Paris, Kevin wakes up to find that he is all alone in this gigantic house. It's all fun and games at first for Kevin, until he discovers that a pair of thieves plan on robbing his house thinking that the place is empty. Whiz kid Kevin sets up a number of booby traps and set ups that severely injure the bandits. Examples include one of the thieves named Harry getting his head set on fire, the other Marv gets hit in the head with an iron. These kind of stunts could kill a person in real life, but the magic of movies allows the bandits to shake it off and continue their mischief.The acting in Home Alone is top notch! Macaulay Culkin is brilliant as Kevin McCallister, the scared yet empowered young boy who takes on the ""Wet Bandits"". Those bandits are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who add so much to the film with their performance. And you get some good screen time from stars such as Catherine O'Hara, John Heard and even John Candy. The traps that Kevin sets are smart and witty, and the location shots are perfect for the tricks he has planned for Harry and Marv.All in all Home Alone is a classic film not only for Christmastime, but all year round.

148,lorcan-61881,The best Christmas movie I've ever seen,10,10 November 2016,"Home alone is my favorite Christmas movie I've ever seen,I have loved it since I was young.

The movie stars our favorite child star Macaulay Culkin who starred in My Girl,The Good Son and many other classic films and he's still out there doing eh...ya know..stuff.. The movie is directed by Chris Columbus who directed the first two Harry Potter films which I love so so so much obviously. The movie I think is written by comedy legend John Huges who is most recognizable for his work on the breakfast club and sixteen candles. Home alone is one of the best Christmas movies but I wouldn't recommend it to small children aged 4 or 5 due to some bad language and violence.",Home Alone
149,Indy-52,one of the best comedy's ever made...,8,6 September 1999,"this movie has to be one of my all-time favorites: Columbus proofed himself as a director in this one, and so did Culkin as an actor.

Expecting a quiet few days on his own he has to contend with a couple of inept burglars with his own inventive traps & bouts of violence.A very simple film with a sugary & predictable message at the end. But inspite of the thread-bare plot it is a very enjoyable romp, perhaps because of the rather inventive but uncomplicated writing from John Hughes.The film only really comes alive during the battle of wits between Culkin & the two robbers (well supported by Pesci & Stern) while the rest of the film just trundles along at a rather predictable pace.I saw this film back in 91 and found it quite funny (still do in fact). But at that time I hadn't really had much chance to see other Pesci movies of the time.But now, some 10 years on everytime I see Pesci screaming in agony as he suffers more comic violence from the inventive little brat I keep thinking he's going to go into Goodfellas or Casino mode and pull out a gun along with a hail of abusive language and shoot the kid full of bullets, or put his head in a vice.But anyway, Home Alone is a good family movie that doesn't stretch the mind and never really offends anyone although perhaps the Tom & Jerry style violence is perhaps a little too strong in places.

Film critics have bashed this movie for being too violent. I disagree. The movie is cartonish, but cartoons tend to be violent, and are fun to watch for this reason.

153,lyubitelfilmov,Unsuccessful robbery or the Little prankster: part one,8,26 December 2020,"Comedy. On the eve of the New Year and Christmas, which will come very, very soon, I decided to recall a series of paintings about the petty prankster Kevin McCallister. And let's start with the first part, of course, whose box office success turned all this disgrace into a series. I can't say that this picture of my childhood, but I definitely managed to watch it, being a small spinner, since this movie was often played on TV, and now it is shown on Channel One EVERY New Year's holidays, forgetting about other films. Anyway. I like this picture, and here's my brief opinion - Unsuccessful robbery. Well, now I ask you not to load the catapults with stale tomatoes, because I intend to tell you not only about the advantages of this Christmas comedy, but also about the disadvantages that I managed to find only now, after many revisions. Then let your humble servant proceed.
So the pros:
1. The story told - well, you already know it without me from A to B, but still. The picture tells the story of the boy Kevin, who, in a hurry, was left by his parents at home. Kevin is at first happy, because the family is far from angelic. But then a problem emerges - they want to rob the house. The hero has no choice but to use improvised means to protect his home from encroachment. Kevin, literally before our eyes, is transforming from a coward and a capricious kid into an intelligent, calculating, courageous and independent boy, and also a defender. In addition to his history, there is also a secondary one, which is no less interesting and gives emotions. The ending is predictable, well-known and moral. After all, the family is much more important than money, no matter how hard they try to refute it. The story may be simple and unpretentious, but catchy. What else do you need for a good Christmas comedy?
2. Atmosphere - the impending holiday reminds of itself literally from every teapot, from every dialogue, from almost every shot, and this is good. Well, and it was not without music, because there are famous Christmas hits and excellent compositions by John Williams, who was responsible for it. Anxiety, loneliness, philosophy, naivety, fear, joy - all these emotions are present here.
3. Humor - if you do not take one moment (we will talk about it in the minuses), then jokes and funny moments are successful here and even still work. I laughed with pleasure again before writing this review. They are unpretentious, sometimes harsh, but they cause a sincere smile even after so many years. This is exactly a comedy, where there is something to laugh at.
So the cons:
1. Replaying - both Kevin and the thieves are terribly replaying. I didn't notice this before, but then it seemed to dawn on me. Okay Kevin, kid, but Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern? What's wrong with them? Adult people, accomplished actors, behave unnaturally in the frame. I understand that in the script they are goofs, but why does it look so creepy? Humor aside, it looks like a silly farce, nothing more. Although no, Macaulay previously acted in films, so he will not give a ride. Why is Kevin so creepy? The acting is visible only in the second half of the picture.
2. Successful traps - more precisely, how well the thieves are substituted under them. They see that it is dangerous, but they go. They see that it is flying, but they stand still. Again, it looks fake. My God, even in the Hong Kong action films of John Woo, opponents were more convincingly exposed to the bullets of the main characters.
A little about the main characters:
1. Kevin McCallister performed by Macaulay Culkin is a capricious child and the youngest in a large family who is tired of his family. Having gone through a series of events, he realizes the value of relatives and friends, despite their unbearable nature. Macaulay played the main character well, although he often overestimated it. Well done!
2. Harry, played by Joe Pesci, is the leader of thieves and, in combination, is a dunce who was able to cheat on a child. Sly, stubborn, and causing danger and a smile, for it causes genuine laughter when it falls into traps. Joe! I will praise you, even in spite of your monstrous overplay. Well done!
2. Marvin played by Daniel Stern - Harry's silly partner, substituting for the most obvious pitfalls. Cowardly, but funny puffs up his eyes and causes laughter, falling into traps. Daniel has a similar story. I will praise, despite the replay. Well done!
I don't consider this picture a masterpiece, but I'm not at all opposed to revising it for New Year or Christmas.
Well, next time we have Kevin's adventures in New York.
As a result, we have a good Christmas comedy about the adventures of Kevin McCallister, with a good script, great music and atmosphere and good acting work (albeit with a replay).
My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",Home Alone

155,BadWebDiver,Great comic revival movie,9,30 March 2002,"This is a great comic story that launched a new child star into the Hollywood stratosphere, and understandably so.This film does show off Macaulay Culkin's brilliant comic execution. Apparently, it was partly the result of John Hughes being impressed with Macaulay's performance in UNCLE BUCK, and was devised as a vehicle for him. What makes this film superior to its imitators and successors is that Kevin is allowed to show comic skills and still come across as a genuine kid.  For example; he wants to watch adults only movies, but he freaks out when he actually sees them.  He wants to shave like his dad, but howls when he applies after-shave lotion. And so on.  The christmas scene in the church is a nice humanitarian touch that later Hollywood kids movies lacked.  The character isn't just a minature adult in a child's body.  This gives the story a lot more personality and depth than the other films of its kind.In fact I think Macaulay demonstrated with this film, the interview scene in UNCLE BUCK, The Nutcracker and other performances that he was (and possibly still is) the best comic actor of his generation.  (Well, a tie between him and Joseph Gordon-Levitt at least).",Home Alone
156,RhapsodyReviews,Holiday Classic.,9,10 December 2019,"Review:
'Home Alone' is a comedy film directed by Chris Columbus.
If you were to ask a room full of people what movie they watch the most around the Holiday's, the majority would say 'Home Alone'. This is such a fun tale from writer John Hughes, and it brings some suspense to Christmas while keeping it child friendly.
The story follows eight-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) who is mistakenly left behind when his family flies to Paris for their Christmas vacation. Kevin initially relishes being home alone, but he soon has to contend with two burglars: Harry Lyme (Joe Pesci) and Marv Merchants (Daniel Stern), who are known as the ""Wet Bandits"".
Macaulay Culkin is a standout in this movie not only because he is in almost every scene, but his acting was very good. He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy after all. He really holds his own among all the adults in the film and it isn't slim picks when you have Joe Pesci, John Heard and Catherine O'Hara.
It's quite unrealistic about how dumb the burglars are, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are a great comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.
Overall, aside from its unrealistic plot, the movie is fun and very entertaining. It's a movie my family watches multiple times throughout the year and it never gets old.
4.5/5",Home Alone
157,Gideon24,A Minor Classic,7,19 March 2015,"John Hughes and Chris Columbus teamed together to bring us one of the biggest box office smashes of 1990...a little thing called Home Alone. A comedy that not only made a lot of money but made a genuine movie star out of the young actor playing the lead role.Macaulay Culkin lights up the screen as a young man named Kevin McAllister, a young boy who actually gets left behind when his family goes out of town for Christmas. Surprisingly, Kevin's realization that his family got a plane without him sits pretty well with him and he settles into the ultimate kid's fantasy of having the whole house to himself. Unfortunately, playtime is cut short when a couple of bumbling thieves (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) somehow get wind of the fact that Kevin is alone in the house, setting in motion a cartoon-like, cat and mouse game between good kid and the bad crooks that puts the best Tom and Jerry cartoons to shame.The film's enjoyment lies in the viewer's complete acceptance of the premise as a fantasy. Yes, Kevin is part of a very large family, but there is NO way any family would get on a plane to leave the country without double and triple checking to make sure that all the kids are present and there is also NO way that two grown men couldn't overpower a child if they wanted to. If you can check these two large lapses in cinematic logic at the door, the film can be enjoyable. Yes, the cartoon-violence that occurs between Kevin and the crooks is a little over the top, but it is what makes the film so funny.Culkin charms in the title role and Pesci and Stern work well together as Kevin's bumbling tormentors. Mention should also be made of Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's parents, who are very funny in the opening scenes. Chris Columbus' direction seems to be based on Warner Brothers cartoons, but who doesn't like Warner Brothers cartoons? So check your brain at the door and you'll see why this film was one of the biggest hits of 1990.",Home Alone

Home Alone achieves cheer, joy, laughter, except for family.Home Alone (written by John Hughes, who also did the funny Breakfast Club) is about an 8-year old boy named Kevin who is accidentally left at home when his parents leave for Christmas vacation. Unfortunately for Kevin, he lives in a rich house, which is targeted by two burglars: Marv and Harry. They plan to rob Kevin's house at 9:00 pm, so Kevin has to protect himself, using self-invented traps.Home Alone is simply full of slapstick humor, with some hidden jokes in between. (One of the funniest parts is the one with the pizza man.) But, John Hughes made one mistake: He forgot to make it realistic. How could Kevin stay asleep, while his whole family is screaming and trying to pack? How could he make so many traps, but not pack a suitcase? How could Marv spend so much time on the floor after tripping, when Harry has grabbed Kevin? How? Well, despite the main flaw, Home Alone makes a fun, heart-warming holiday movie. I would definitely recommend it! Of course, it isn't perfect, but its fun and fun is what holiday movies should be! 7/10 Good: Fun, funny and heart-warming, and has nothing to do with Santa (like most Christmas movies do)Bad: Unrealistic, and it could be funnierFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Home Alone

Written and produced by the late, great John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus, it follows the story of young Kevin McCallister (Played by Macaulay Culkin, arguably the best child actor since Shirley Temple) who's constantly picked on and looked down upon by his large, extended family but especially by his older and much hated brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray in what has to be his best role). On the eve of the big family vacation, Kevin lashes out and gets sent to the attic by his impatient mom (The talented and ravishing Catherine O'Hara) and right then Kevin makes the prophetic wish of never seeing his family again. Little does he know, his wish is about to come true when due to a convenient power outage, his parents' alarm clocks fails to go off and the result is sheer holiday hell as everybody scrambles like there's no tomorrow to catch that flight. Everybody that is, except little Kevin who's forgotten by everyone and as the title says, is left home alone. Shock turns to happiness as Kevin realizes his wish has come true.But it's not all fun and games as two naughty burglars Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give a wonderful performance together as the two bumbling thieves) are on the rampage in Kevin's neighborhood. Rather than running away like most kids might do, Kevin decides to fight back using his creativity and some simple but potentially bone shattering traps. It all might sound like a simple holiday comedy to be watched and then put away, but there's something more to the film that keeps me and many others coming back year after year. To be sure, the physical comedy of Harry and Marv getting their asses handed to them by Kevin's traps is nothing short of a laugh riot (Traps include anything from heated door handles to slippery steps).But the film also manages to include a lot of heart as Kevin slowly but surely begins to realize that family is what the holidays are all about and without them it's pretty lonely, a lesson he learns first hand by the at first feared but then loved neighborhood recluse, Old Man Marley (the late, great character actor Robert Blossom). John Williams score to this is undoubtedly one of his best as it is both grand and yet not overbearing in the least. On the contrary, it manages to invoke the spirit of Christmas in all of us while giving us the chills because of its beauty. And of course, who can forget the performance of Macaulay Culkin since the film rests on his shoulders more than anything else. With his mischievous grin and resourcefulness, we just can't help but love his character and root for him all the way through the film. I should also mention that the movie includes a small but very memorable performance by the legendary John Candy (Try not to laugh at the conversation he has with Kevin's mom in the back of the van!). ""Home Alone"" is one of those films that no matter how many times you might see it, it just never gets old. The movie is a time capsule in many ways because it somehow captured not only the holiday spirit but also the magic of the time it was made in, the 90's, a time where not only were the movies better but so was everything else. It is for that reason that movie will live on forever and ever, much like the spirit of Christmas itself. So without further adieu, I urge you to watch this modern classic and if you're ever going on big trip with the family, make sure that you have all your children! Also starring John Heard and a host of other memorable actors. Merry Christmas everyone!!!!!!!",Home Alone
160,Ginger87,A Great Film And One Of My Fav's,10,21 August 2004,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*""Home Alone"" has got to be one of the best films ever made.  It is a great, hilarious, and enjoyable movie.  This is a good film to watch in the Christmas and Thanksgiving season.The acting in this film is so well done and the tricks Kevin pulls on the robbers are hysterical.  My favorite part of the film is when he's defending the house with all the traps especially when he throws the paint cans.  That part had me laughing nonstop.Overall I love this movie and suggest everyone should see it. The second ""Home Alone"" I also love, tho the third and fourth aren't that good. I give this film 10/10 stars.",Home Alone
161,AdrienneGrayceMusic,10 out of 10 Movie for sure,10,27 December 2018,"Not sure why it took me so long to review my favorite christmas film of all time but here it goes. I was 10 when this came out, and back then, I remember watching it at least 10 times at the movies. I loved it then and loved it now. Yes, it is a little far fetched, and would not happen in real life, but it is a movie, and not to be taken seriously! I stopped watching after Home alone 2 because Macaulay Culkin made the film what it was, and no one could replace him. I was NOT interested in seeing parts 3 and 4 because he was not it them. Lots of funny one liners in this movie. Since I watch it every year, I can recite every line, word for word. The actors and characters were spot on. The christmas sountrack here is my favorite of all time. This will forever be a classic and will always be my favorite christmas movie.",Home Alone
162,Ibuk,Home Alone- A firm holiday classic,8,23 December 2007,"Where would the holidays be without the antics of Kevin Mcallister. When released it became a huge hit and made Macaulay Culkin a mega star. It was directed by Chris Columbus, who was also responsible for bringing Harry Potter to the big screen. For a kids movie it is pretty violent, but that only adds to the overwhelming appeal of this classic.Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were superb as the burgles who are no match for an 8 year old.In fact Home Alone is reminiscent of the Tom and Jerry cartoons where someone would get hit over a thousand and would still be able to stand back up and go back for more. Some of the traps Kevin sets for the burgles for ingenious. Home Alone spawned 3 more sequels but only the second movie could come close to matching the genius of the original. Violent but immense fun for all ages.",Home Alone

Actually i cannot really think of any recent Christmas orientated films that come close to this.Its Child star is Macaulay Culkin is a very good actor who with his funny expressions and fun characteristics make it a 10/10 for me. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern really do add a very comedic side to it all.Story is a family all rushing to get to the airport and what happens? they leave a kid behind Home alone, meanwhile the street they live on is having a spate of burglaries and when they get to the child's house they are in for a big surprise.This really is side splitting funny, maybe a Laurel And Hardy take on things will give you some idea of the capers that occur... great film with a laugh a minute.",Home Alone

166,neenahhh,Great if you have company,6,5 April 2011,"'Home Alone' is about a young boy,Kevin McCallister, who gets left behind in his house accidentally. When his family realizes this, it is already too late, seeing as they already took the plane and are thousands of miles away from home. But despite that, they still try all that they can do to get home and contact Kevin. Meanwhile, back in Kevin's neighborhood, there has been reports of ongoing robberies. Kevin, with his many tricks and fast wit, does his best to protect his home from the burglars.The movie is a bit unrealistic, but the again, there wouldn't be any movies if nothing out-of-the-ordinary ever happened. To enjoy this movie, it is best if viewers don't over-think about what happened and just sit back and take in Kevin's crazy antics.I admit that I began getting bored when it was the climax of the film. I felt like the humor was very cheap and it wasn't at all engaging. I did however like the message and the heartwarming feeling that I felt during the ending.For me, this was a mediocre film. I'm sure I would have liked this film more if I had company. This film may have many people saying it's very hilarious, but I found that I only really laughed about twice. Maybe if I had company, I would have appreciated this film more. I'll keep that in mind when December 2011 comes around.Viewed on: April 5, 2011",Home Alone
167,guyfromjerzee,Now that I'm an adult....,5,24 December 2006,"...I decided to give ""Home Alone"" another look. This used to be one of my favorite movies....when I was about 7 years old. I remember receiving the tape of this movie for Christmas and watching it about 100 times. When you're a kid, a film of this sort is a barrel of laughs. As an adult...it's pretty dull. Not to mention the film hasn't stood the test of time. Macaulay Culkin was an adorable kid, but that's just the point. He was one of those cutesie only-in-the-movies-type kids that got famous for smiling into the camera and belting out semi-witty one-liners. It bothers me every time I watch Culkin's character speak his thoughts out loud, when he's all alone. Having shot a couple student films, that has always been one of my pet peeves. Most non-actors assume that acting is all about talking, and they feel the need to verbalize everything they're feeling, rather than expressing them in facial expressions and body language--like everyday people do! Luckily, Culkin has matured since then, and is now a much better actor. The climax of the movie involving the bumbling burglars still makes me laugh, though, for the most part. It's just weirder now to see the foul-mouthed Joe Pesci in a family film. I still find the interactions between Pesci and Daniel Stern mildly amusing. But all in all, unlike a film like ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Home Alone"" is not a film the adults can enjoy just as much as the kids. I'm sure the kids won't mind Culkin's hammy acting and the constant use of low-brow humor.",Home Alone

169,rooboy84,Fun for the family,7,17 March 2002,"Home alone is a family movie. I played the game on NES and it was discusting. But let's not go into that. This movie was entertaining right from the start, and although I wouldn't laugh at it, it would bring a smile to my face. Eight-year old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) Is good in his roll and brings a brightness to the movie. But maybe it's a bit far fetched.66%",Home Alone
170,claudonio,Classic Comedy,9,7 January 2000,"""Home Alone"" is a very funny comedy that has become a timeless classic. This is the perfect family movie, it offers something to both adults and children. Macauly Culkin is perfect in his role as a kid who has been accidently left behind by his family. This is a very funny movie, I recommend it.",Home Alone
171,MUFCOK,A Christmas Classic,9,8 December 2014,"It's that time of year again, the time of year when it is acceptable to binge on Christmas films. The first one I watched this year was Home Alone. It is a classic for me, certainly a child hood favourite!The story is a very simple one; Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) is accidentally left at Home over the Christmas as his whole family fly to Paris. They board the plane without realising that they have left one of their Children home alone! Two small time robbers are also in the area, looking to break into houses, they target the McCallister household as they believe they are all away for the Christmas holidays. It is now up to Kevin to protect his house from the burglars by setting up traps and playing pranks, some of which are absolutely brilliant! The two Robbers; Marv & Harry, played by Daniel Stern & Joe Pesci, give fantastic performances. They portray the classic dumb & dumber routine. Harry thinks he is the brains and sees himself as the leader & Marv plays the really stupid, gullible one who falls for much more simple traps. The on screen chemistry between these two and the relationship they have is fantastic, it comes across very realistic and hilarious.Macaulay Culkin was 9 or 10 when Home Alone was filmed and given such a big role with this much screen time must have been a big challenge but he walked it and gave a very convincing performance. The Home Alone films are pretty much all he has been known for, which is a shame really, he had a few other films but none are as well-known and successful as these. Of course this isn't the most realistic films and it does have massive plot holes and ridiculous scenarios, but who cares. It's fun! It's Christmassy & It's got great characters with some truly hilarious moments.Overall, Home Alone is a very fun movie; I have the relation to it as it was always on at Christmas when I was a child. But even if this isn't the case, I'm sure many adults who are new to this will love it just the same as us who have fond memories of watching it as a child!8/10",Home Alone
172,possumopossum,Very Entertaining as Long as You Don't Think Too Much,7,6 December 2006,"This is a movie you have to watch with your brain in neutral. If you think about it, you'll just go nuts. True, they threw plot logic out the window with this movie. A parent who would leave a child home alone, whether accidentally or not, would probably be visited by social services, be thrown in jail, and have their children taken away from them. (Especially if they do this two years in a row, but that's another movie.) The pranks Kevin pulls on these two stupid criminals should not be tried at home. Setting hair on fire, things of that nature would kill someone in real life. They should put up a disclaimer in this movie warning of the dangers of some of these pranks. Otherwise, it's a laugh a minute fun little romp, especially when it comes time for Kevin to defend his home. (Love the way he played a scene from ANGELS WITH FILTHY SOULS when he scared off the pizza man and when he scared off the burglars early in the story.) That business with old Mr. Marley (have to see the movie again to be sure I got that name right) was very touching at the end. It showed Kevin wasn't just another dumb, bratty little kid, that he had a heart of gold. Very entertaining. Just sit back, relax, enjoy the ride, and don't think too much.",Home Alone
173,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Timeless, one of the best Christmas films in a long time, and one of the best family movies ever made",9,17 February 2005,"Home Alone is underrated according to the IMDb. It only has a 6.4 out of ten. It deserves to at least be a 7. This is a great family movie, but there are many adults and teens out there who also love it. It isn't a dark movie, but it isn't all fluffy like some of the movies released today that are considered family movies. It is also one of the best Christmas movies ever made, and is still the last great Christmas movie released to this day.There are three sequels; Home Alone 2 is pretty good, Home Alone 3 is bad, but Home Alone 4 is a made for TV flop, so I won't say anything else. I'm not sure why, but it seems like many kids prefer the 2nd and 3rd Home Alone movies over the first one. I don't see their reasons for that.This is a great movie for kids, and many kids can relate to it. I'm sure every kid out there has wished they could be alone and away from their family, but what kid would know what to do if two burglars were after him. That is where all of the fun in this movie comes from.You should see this movie, it has become a tradition for me to watch this every Christmas. Maybe it will become a tradition of yours as well.",Home Alone
174,samcracc,great Christmas movie,10,3 July 2007,"I saw that movie this year and it was excellent. Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was excellent. Joe Pesci as Harry and Daniel Strens as Marv where Hilarius. John Heard as Peter McCallister was brilliant. Catherine O'Hara as Kate McCallister was beautiful. Sam Dosen't like Uncle Frank. This movie is when the McCallisters go to France, Paris to a family Christmas trip. Just then Kevin McCallister stays at the house and lives alone. They where two bad guys named Marv and Harry they where the Wet Bandids to steal and ruins people house like when Marv sinks the house with water.

176,mbhgkmsgg,Home Alone,9,13 December 2020,"Home Alone is one of the most iconic Christmas movies of all time. It's one that I heard about every year come holiday season. As such, I'm genuinely quite blown away by the fact that this was my first time seeing it. Certainly, I had seen some snippets here and there and knew what the movie was about, but for the most part, I saw it without knowing what would happen.Since this was the first time for me seeing Home Alone, I'll start by saying that I absolutely adored it. It was tremendously entertaining, funny, and enjoyable. It felt wonderfully Christmasy and captured the essence of the holiday perfectly. While it's easy to focus on the chaotic antics of the third act, I also loved how important family was in this movie. Be it Kevin wishing he had his family back, or his mom doing anything in her power to get back to her son. Or, maybe even the neighbour connecting with his son again. In the midst of all the chaos and comedy, there is also a wonderful and heartwarming message in there. And although I really, really enjoyed all the action, this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good as it is, if it weren't for that message.The story, which I'm sure everyone is already more than familiar with, leaves us with Kevin, an eight-year-old boy accidentally left behind from the family trip to Paris. While Kevin, who isn't the biggest fan of his family, enjoys the freedom he has, he soon realizes how much he actually misses them. And when a pair of burglars try to take advantage of the parents being gone, Kevin must overcome his fears and defend the house. It's a story that sounds extremely simple on paper. And while for the most part, it is, the way it's crafted, leaves room for countless wonderful and iconic moments. It's genuinely fun to watch Kevin learn about the most ordinary everyday things, like laundry and grocery shopping, and it's equally fun to follow the chaotic journey that the rest of the family has. Once you add the cherry on the top, which is, of course, the third act battle between Kevin and the burglars, what you have, is an immensely entertaining film.What surprised me the most, was how gruesome, and brutal, Kevin's traps were. In fact, the whole battle sequence was much darker than I ever could've expected. However, the way it's handled makes it an enormously funny sequence. Harry and Marv, the burglars, create most of the comedy in Home Alone, and they are fantastic. They provide funny scenes throughout the film but truly shine once they try to rob the McCallister house. No matter how brutally Kevin's traps harm them, their reactions are always hilarious and wonderfully over the top. Quite rarely do I find myself laughing out loud while watching a movie, but during Home Alone, I found myself doing it quite often. The comedy, which feels quite carefully administered, always feels natural and never unnecessarily forced. The result, accordingly, is wonderful.Although it took me embarrassingly long to finally watch Home Alone, I'm glad I did. Before seeing it, I never understood why so many people spoke so highly of it. But now, it's easy to see why. It's a wonderful movie filled with Christmas cheer and a heartwarming story, while simultaneously being tremendously entertaining and funny. It's a film that just became a part of my Christmas tradition, and it's one that I absolutely love.",Home Alone
177,moviemattb,An Unforgettable Christmas Classic,10,16 December 2014,"""Home Alone"" is about a boy name Kevin McCallister who is left behind with his family that they have gone to Paris as he takes care of the house, and deal with some burglars. I grew up with this movie as it is part of my childhood, and it is still fun to watch from being a kid to an adult. This is one of my favorite Christmas movies, and I do watch it when it comes to the Christmas holidays. John Hughes' script is extremely well written as well as Chris Columbus' direction. John Williams' music is so memorable and beautiful at the same time. The cast in this movie were great, but I give highly praises to Macaulay Culkin for his performance as the main lead. He is star of this whole movie, and fun to watch. Also, I give highly praises to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern as Harry and Marv who they are known as the Wet Bandits. The movie is filled with slapstick like ""The Three Stooges,"" when Kevin sets up the traps as both Harry and Marv go through a lot of pain as the movie goes toward the end. The movie is not only funny, but it has a lot of heart to it that is filled with the spirit of Christmas. This is the best of all the ""Home Alone"" movies, and nothing beats them. The only good sequel is the second, which I will get to that later but the third and fourth were terrible; they tried to be fun and entertaining, but they were not and they were not needed to be made. So, anyway, ""Home Alone"" is definitely the one to watch during the Christmas holidays as well as the second, which again, I will get to that later. If you haven't seen the first ""Home Alone"" movie, please feel free to check it out because it is fun, entertaining and it really does have that Christmas feeling. When you finish watching the movie toward the end credits, you come out feeling good at the end of it. ""Home Alone"" is definitely an unforgettable Christmas classic, and I give it a 10 out of 10.",Home Alone
178,ed_two_o_nine,Christmas Classic,8,4 January 2009,"Having just watched this for the first time in ages and at the cinema for the first time since its release I am reminded of what a fun film this is. It works very well as a feel good Christmas movie and as a live action update of a loony tunes cartoon. My feeling s about this film have not really changed at all in the eighteen years since its release. It is a small idea with a huge pay off. When Kevin (a never bettered Macualay Culkin) is left home alone over Christmas when his family leave for a trip to Paris and accidentally forget him, he is left to fend for himself as a pair of burglars tries to invade his home. For a child actor Culkin does a remarkable job practically carrying the movie on his own, appearing in pretty much every scene. The burglars are fended of in a string of comedy sequences that a very funny and aided no end by Joe Pesci playing the leader of the pair Harry. There is a convenient sub plot where Kevin finds friendship from the unlikely source of the neighbourhood old man all the kids are scared of. All in all this is a movie to be enjoyed at all times and that is guaranteed to make one feel better.",Home Alone

It was only good that nobody got me to watch this for this is a sick movie! You would never guess how much violence this film contains in innocent frames.Perhaps times have changed in the almost past twenty years but if burglars who shout out lines like ""I gonna kill you"" and ""maybe he committed suicide"" don't sound pretty disgusting for a children's movie then something has gone totally wrong. The burglars also threaten to burn the boys head and bite his fingers off one by one - Is it normal in some places of the Earth to threaten kids with bad things like that? I really hope that people aren't that mean.Furthermore the injuries made to the burglars are quite lethal too. That they are evil doesn't justify to show stunts where man lands on his head with surely breaking his neck - not even Jackass the series or the movie featured anything that dumb. In one scene the other burglar makes such a scream that it makes many horror films pale.And no, I am not some superior moral guardian who hates comical violence - I would just rather recommend Jackass the movie for children rather than this. The only audience I truly recommend this are college students who really need to turn their brains off after some really hard work.",Home Alone

183,The-Last-Prydonian,Nostalgic fun although your enjoyment on this this might depend on how far you're willing to suspend disbelief,8,18 December 2017,"It's safe to say I think that Home Alone, along with movies like The Goonies and Ghostbusters is going to be on of those for people of a certain generation as a must go to when it comes to sheer nostalgia. It's notable that it catapulted then 10 year old MacCaulay Culkin to international stardom, and brings back fond memories for people like myself who remember going to see it at the cinema as a kid. As it comes that bit closer to hitting the thirty year anniversary of it's release, it's still lost none of it's appeal and has thus far stood the test of time. All this said, and in all fairness I can't say it's a brilliant movie and given it's premise, your enjoyment of it will probably depend on how much you're willing to suspend disbelief. This is after all about a an eight year old named Kevin who's criticised by the fellow childhood members of his family for not being able to pack his own suitcase (their family is travelling to Paris for Xmas) and yet proves remarkably resourceful when fending off the movies antagonists; the burglars Harry and Marv played with hilarious brilliance by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. Written by John Hughes who sadly passed away several years ago (as incidentally did actor John Heard who plays Kevin's father in the movie), he makes good use of it's basic premise, with young Kevin attempting to temporarily adjust to finding himself on his own and without any parental supervision. Fun moments include him being questioned by a suspicious checkout operator while he's grocery shopping, and tricking Harry and Marv in to thinking his house is still operating by constructing a fake party using cardboard cutouts. It's certainly one of Hughes most inventive movies as a writer, despite how far fetched it is. The now legendary final act is a masterclass of slapstick comedy and you'd be hard pressed not to find yourself rolling on the floor with laughter.Of course with this being a Hughes movie, or just any family comedy of this nature there's going to be some life lessons learned for our plucky young hero by the end of it. Thankfully however it's beautifully handled and while predictably sentimental, it never becomes cringe-inducing. MacCaulay Culkin brings innocent charm to the role of Kevin, and displays natural comic timing. He also handles the transition from obnoxious brat to lovable sympathetic young scamp effectively well. The rest of the supporting cast which includes Catherine O'Hara, the late Roberts Blossom and the late great John Candy (making a relatively brief appearance) are all on top form. No doubt this is a film that will be well remembered for years to come even with it's glaring flaws, you can't deny it's charm and I defy anyone not have a lump in their throat in it's moving final moments.",Home Alone
184,abalpn-99472,"It's still a classic and holiday film to me. Well done, John Hughes and Chris Columbus.",10,1 December 2019,I was two years old when Home Alone came out in 1990. I grew up watching this as a kid and I still like the film to this day. Christmas is coming and I watch it whenever the holidays are coming. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious as Harry and Marv. The greatest comedy duo of the early 1990's. Kevin's traps are awesome and funny. I laugh when Harry and Marv get hit. Kevin's the smartest 8-year-old kid and he always wins by beating up Harry and Marv. Everyone needed a good laugh and I'm one of them. There are touching moments and hilarious moments.,Home Alone

186,byson5186,A Movie That Defines The Holiday Season,8,25 September 2014,"I have a friend who I once saw call the Holiday Season, the Home Alone Season. It's amazing to think how this movie was made many years ago, but is widely remembered and still regularly watched. It seems like almost all of us have seen Home Alone, and it seems like most people have seen it more than once. For one, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie outside of the Holiday Season, just how you likely wouldn't listen to Christmas music outside of the Holiday Season even though you could. I mean this movie just gives you the Christmas spirit when it's around. I watched this movie around 6 months ago, and it just didn't seem as enjoyable as it used to seem, and I just thought it's best if I wait until the Holiday Season to see it, even though you can probably find it on TV all year round, and during the Holiday Season it will be on ABC Family. It's just better to get into the Christmas Spirit when Christmas is around. Anyway, I just left a review on the 2nd Home Alone movie. I prefer the 2nd one over this as I feel like the 2nd one is more funny and we see Kevin in a more exciting place than home, as in the 2nd movie he's in NYC. In this movie, he's home alone in his quiet neighborhood where most of the other neighbors seem gone and a neighborhood that's being burglarized at the same time by Marv and Harry. However, while watching this movie I noticed there aren't many exciting scenes until the climax of the movie. Kevin is also somewhat of a brat, especially during the beginning of the movie like the way a kid who is supposed to be 8 talks to his Mom. This movie shows family time as showing a rich family inviting their extended family over and all trying to leave for Paris. So, we remember the opening scene showing a family that is in a hurry all around the house and Kevin feeling ditched by his family and being a brat about that. While this movie has it's flaws it is still somewhat enjoyable, I mean we've all seen it and I think a lot of us are tired of it because we've seen it many times and basically know what's going to happen. Also, I'm surprised this movie has done so well as a movie. One similar movie I prefer over Home Alone is Blank Check. I think Blank Check has more of a plot than Home Alone. By all means, this movie is still good and entertaining. I'll want to watch this movie again during the Holiday Season just to get myself into the Christmas Spirit. I give this movie an 8/10.",Home Alone

The holidays started off well when the McCallister Family decides they want to go to Paris for the holidays. Kevin feels the family does not notice that things just don't seem right until the night before the family was leaving for Paris that things go down hill. The next day when leaving for Paris they do something that no family would ever do like leave your child at home and be 1,000 miles away. What happens next while his family tries getting back will make you wonder can Kevin prove to his parents anything is possible to protect himself being alone. I think that after seeing this and buying it that anything can happen when children think before doing. Kevin has to not only care for his self but protect the home from the burglars that are out there. Can Kevin do it and his family get back in time for Christmas. You will be anxious to find go out and buy it. It was a hit.",Home Alone
189,AmyJenson1995,My favorite Holiday Movie,8,23 December 2015,If there is one movie I would never miss during the holidays it would be Home Alone.It is hilarious and sweet as the same time. Macaulay Culkin is so adorable as this resourceful little child who was left alone by his own family and had to defend his house against two resilient clumsy burglars who preyed on his home while trying to cope with his situation of a 8 years old boy home alone.All the gags are hitting their mark it is absolutely joyful to see Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern falling in each trap set up by Kevin. But it is also so sweet to follow Kevin trying to act like a man for example when he used aftershave and he screams because it burns. I find this so cute.Home Alone is a marvelous Holidays movie all the family can enjoy. The children will love it as do the parents.,Home Alone
190,clacura,The Willy Wonka of a New Generation!,10,2 April 2020,"John Hughes hit every detail with this movie! it is a timeless classic of filmmaking every bit as significant as any dramatic movie. Why? Well, watch it. It has everything. This film should be studied by students and a class taught on how to make a great movie.The atmosphere is perfect. The house, the neighborhood...it all is perfection. The snow, the Santa Shop, the grocery store, it all works as the template or canvas for this Hughes painting.Casting. Mom and dad are perfect. They play their parts subdued to let the main characters shine. All the kids blend in. Even Santa Claus is played to perfection...guy is smoking and off to a card game, car won't start. The pizza kid...Casting the B and C roles is just as important as the A roles.Pace & tempo. The film builds well. Joe Pesci as the officer scouting the neighborhood with the gold tooth...not over done. By the time Kevin defends his house we are all in.Of course no 8yo would be able to pull off what Kevin did, but this is part of a movie and it works so well we believe it for two hours because the fun is so good. This is family entertainment...all ages will enjoy this. The old man is brilliant, again, the casting is perfection and the storyline very believable. We all knew that old guy in the neighborhood that had a scary story.Culkin should have been nominated for an Oscar his performance was that good. The church scene with the old man was a director's dream come true. There are so many detailed plot lines that merge together like the tarantula, hitting the house metal sculpture, the gold tooth, a John Candy cameo...the only other movie of this generation that hit all these marks was Back to the Future. Same brilliance and attention to detail. You can watch BTTF 10 times and catch something new each visit.The reason we don't have many of these movies is because it is hard to pull off.

The highest grossing movie of 1990, and at the time the third highest grossing movie of all time, this movie had a lot of potential. But it was slammed by critics, although audiences seemed to enjoy it, and those exact same critics hating on it back then call it a ""Christmas classic"" nowadays.If you didn't know and have been living under a rock for a large percentage of your life, Home Alone is a story about a kid who hates his parents and always thinks they're out to get him and make him seem like the bad guy when he's really not. We see Kevin get discriminated by his family and everyone else around him and can't stand seeing him get tortured by his family. This movie is so damn quotable, nearly every line Kevin says I say on a daily basis, ""When I grow up and get married I'm living alone, you hear me?! I'm living alone, I'm living alone!!""
Kevin wishes his family would disappear and we're sort of on the same path as him, the next day he sleeps in and completely forgets the family's trip to France which leads to, ""I made my family disappear"". What is so terrific about Joe Pesci's performance were his restrictions, he wasn't in a Martin Scorsese movie where he could say all the swear words under the blue moon, he was in a family movie which meant he could not swear and the exact same year Home Alone came out 2 months after Goodfellas, which shows how diverse Joe Pesci is.Is there anything I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a holiday classic, it's my favourite winter themed movie, my favourite Christmas movie, and my favourite performance from a child actor until Hugo came around. Grade: A+",Home Alone

She said, ""I don't know why people think this is a Christmas movie, there is hardly anything related to Christmas in it."" After hearing this, I realized that she was correct.Home Alone is a holiday classic, but not because it has the typical Christmas traits you would expect. It is a classic because it has aged well and it's a universally loved family movie set in winter. With that said, It is misleading to call it a Christmas movie. Sure, there is references to the holidays here and there, but does that make it a Christmas film? No, not really.This is an example of how family movies should be made. I'll go as far as saying that Home Alone is one of the greatest family movies of all time. If you still haven't seen this one in 2019, you should.",Home Alone

It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars.Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.",Home Alone

It really is a film that appeals to everyone and is just really funny and festive. Basically the outline of the film is Kevin accidentally gets left home alone while his family goes on vacation while he is home alone we see the fun and outrageous things he gets up too but things suddenly change when two sneaky burglars decided to try steal his neighbourhood the film is seriously funny and has a good cast. Kevin is the main character and all though some of his acting falls flat overall he is great in it and the two burglars are absolutely hysterical the way he plots to keep his house safe with all the quirky little boogie traps absolutely great!!

200,SeptumSin,A Christmas Classic You should give a chance,8,7 December 2008,This is a really good family film so long as you can get through the slapstick.Home alone is pretty much as it says. A family decides to go to Paris for the holidays. Unfortunately in their rush they left one small thing behind...their youngest son. Now he not only must take on the task of managing the house but he also needs to outwit some burglars before they take over. Will he get through the holidays alive? This movie is kind of looked at as a simple slapstick movie but in truth all of the slapstick is pretty much in the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie is a pretty nice and touching Christmas tale that covers the areas of family and togetherness. The acting is fairly decent in this film and the characters are pretty likable. The music is very well done and the setting really gives you the feel of a true Christmas classic. If you haven't watched this film yet then definitely check it out.,Home Alone

202,brower8,Guilty pleasure in an implausible movie,6,22 January 2004,"This movie stretches credibility to its limits. Sure, it's a comedy, so it can get away with some stuff. A kid is more competent than everyone else in an upper-middle-class family and he gets stuck at home because the family doesn't count its kids right. Two dimwitted crooks set out to burglarize a house believing that the family is away for the holiday; the kid is there, and he is a menace. The kid has an engineering talent freakishly developed for a ten-year-old kid and the sadistic cleverness that that he exposes in creating Rube Goldberg-like devices for tormenting a pair of burglars who fail to get the message that there really is someone there. I know that the garden variety of crooks are usually on the low side on intellectual development, but one time would be enough -- right? How many times do those crooks have to take falls, burns, and sharp objects into them before they learn?It's somewhat fun -- if you can pass up the stupidity, the gaps in the plot, and the mean-spiritedness beneath a saccharine veneer.",Home Alone
203,crash21,Just plain stupid,2,9 December 2016,"First off, wouldn't the family have realized they still hadn't given out an airplane ticket to someone, wouldn't that mean something to them right there in the beginning? This movie is centered all around the pathetic Christmas miracle theory.I have to ask when they realize that the kid has been left home alone by himself, why don't the parents just call the house, a friend neighbor, or even the police to go pick him up? They could even give the cops instructions to use a door-ram on an outside door to get in to the house and secure the kid. When the kid realizes that he has been left home alone, he could go straight to a friend neighbor, call local police, or even call 911.I also love the scenarios the kid supposedly comes up with by himself; first with the gangster movie scene to scare off the pizza delivery, I would hope if the delivery person had actually believed the scenario, that it would be immediately reported to the cops.Then the whole scenario when he realizes the two criminals are going to be trying to rob the house, he comes up with a plan to take them out in a couple hours, the plan nearly kills the criminals and almost burns down the house. After all of this is finished, the kid finally calls the police. If he knew this from the beginning he would have never logically done anything but first call a reliable emergency number.Once the criminals are taken out, he's still home alone and quickly cleans up the stuff that took the criminals out? Then his mom arrives, along with his whole family arriving shortly after. The family is suddenly all together again, was this a Christmas miracle?I will admit, the movie is fun before you're even a teenager, but when you look at it later on, you'll realize it's nothing but a pathetic joke. Logically, it nearly tells kids to do things dangerously while teaching them not to use things that are truly secure like the emergency system.",Home Alone
204,mirkobozic,Kevin's home run,8,24 December 2018,"Over the years, this kind of became the comedic equivalent of eggnog, gingerbread and the Nutcracker. It's tedious during any other time of the year, but it works perfectly well come late December. This was the one and probably the last time that anyone fancied Macaulay Culkin as an actor, who developed from Michael Jackson's homebuddy to a thespian has-been with alcoholic issues and managed to emerge from it only a short while ago. However, it's a pleasure to watch him in his acting prime (however sad that may sound). Here he's the cute little Kevin who gets left behind at home when his family goes on a Christmas trip to Paris. Two burglars eventually notice that he's all alone in the big house and they decide to have a go at it. They're taken by surprise when they run straight into the trap of the sadistic kid who turns their effort into a hilarious near-death experience. The comedies nowadays don't really reach the quality level like this one. It doesn't insult my inteligence and the message isn't ironic or too tacky, apart from the over-the-top Christmas decor that looks as if the Rockefeller Christmas tree exploded inside. The pranks Kevin pulls on them are plain silly and the huge family looks like an embodiment of a Norman Rockwell painting, exaggerated to borderline cult. This movie spawned numerous sequels but it's only the two with Culking that are really fun to watch. the plot is simple, the pranks are silly and the whole thing works just because the context of it is undemanding. Just like Culkin's one-character hit, this is a one-time movie and that's why it's likable and so enduring. That's unlikely to change any time soon.",Home Alone

This is like a childhood dream. I remember when I was mad at my family. Along with that, he has to deal with two robbers. He does the coolest thing, he sets traps through his house.

206,AsifZamir,One of the best Christmas movies of all time,10,18 November 2013,"Home Alone is a fun family comedy starring Macauley Culkin as young Kevin, who accidentally gets left behind, when his family and extended family leave on a hasty departure for Paris for the Christmas season. Before this happens, he and his mom (Catherine O'Hara), have an argument and she is terrified when she finds out her little boy has been left behind while in mid-flight.Home Alone is a little boys journey of being alone at home, learning how to survive in the big world and having to fight off a couple of house robbers (the Wet Bandits). Culkin is brilliant in Home Alone. He sets booby traps, such as shaded mannequins he makes dance on strings behind the picture window curtains to fool the robbers into thinking there is someone home, and continues to set booby traps until ""Old Man"" his next door neighbour, who he initially was very scared of, intervenes.Home Alone led to four more sequels and three video games. Culkin won several awards including Best Young Actor Starring in a Motion Picture, the American Comedy Award and Funniest Actor in a Motion Picture (Leading Role) in 1991. Cast includes Culkin (Kevin), O'Hara (Kevin's mom Kate), John Heard as Kevin's father Peter, Joe Pesci as Harry and Daniel Stearn as Marv. Pesci and Stern were the Wet Bandits.

In fact, even though I find it great now, I think I see more that makes it so than I did as a child. As an adult, I notice things I didn't previously. The mark of a good movie is if that can happen--if you can come back years later and see some new things--and you still like it! This is a good movie.As a child, it was scary and funny anc clever and cute. As an adult, I'm noticing how timeless it is. Even the setting makes it difficult to tell it's 20 years old. And I'm just now realizing how well off the McCallisters were! The house is the bomb! And taking a family trip to France? Who does that? How awesome is that? Now I find myself wishing I could have that lifestyle! Before, I don't think I even noticed.To sum it up, the people who created this movie were forward-thinking. They pushed the envelope as far as characterization and dialogue. Kevin is a character you just don't see everyday. The supporting characters are all A+. Everyone seems to just ""fit"" their roles. Beyond that, the plot is clever and the setting is very realistic (notice the details in the house decorating next time you see it, no corners were left unturned it seems.)

The McAllister family is on a massive trip to France for the holidays. Thing is when the day comes and a head count is done young Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) is forgotten about. While it does strain on what is plausible, it still works due to mother Kate (Catherine O'Hara) putting everything aside to get home to Kevin.In what is also a fairly thin plot I forgive, because of the two thieves Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) who call themselves The Wet Bandits are great! They try to get into the McAllister home to rob it while they are away on vacation. Kevin though, has some ideas and traps of his own to deal with this pair. Pesci and Stern work great together and they really add a lot of humour and comic soul to the film. With the addition of Culkin's at times chaotic energy and John Hughes' script there are laughs to be had in this Christmas film. Directed by Chris Columbus.

It is a OK movie, with enough holiday themes and scenery to keep me satisfied it is a holiday movie. McCauley Culkin does a good job playing off two bumbling, and really dumb burglars. It helps to have a mansion as the backdrop to foiling Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern.  Some of the scenes where the 2 bumbling burglars try to eneter the house are charmingly funny. It is annoying that the script could not come up more clever ways for Pesci and Stern to react other than ""Ow!' or ""frism-frasm"". And the kid delivers enough hits that would kill a normal person. But today's movies must add violence as one of the ingredients to a successful movie. Audiences have developed a ""taste"" for it, even if this was made to be a holiday movie to be seen by millions of kids.

220,spenrh,"Good in parts, but quite implausible",6,30 November 2018,"I enjoyed this movie when I was a kid. It was an original exciting premise, kid home alone struggling to do everything himself but also enjoying such freedom, and him getting the better over 2 bumbling burglars.There was some amusing humor including the way the neighbor kid (who had a funny scene with the annoyed van driver) got counted as one of the crew so the family got the family count correct. That was the rooting cause of Kevin's family forgetting him, that combined with Kevin remaining asleep on the third floor where he got sent to the previous night due to him pushing his older brother Buzz for eating his cheese pizza. The other kids (Kevin's sister and his cousins) did not respect him, and his Uncle Frank had an intense dislike for him that was never fully explained other than him thinking how he's just a little brat. But the other kids were bratty too, so I'm guessing that Uncle Frank was just another bratty kid in a grownup's body who only wanted to go with popular opinion and dislike him just because the other kids also did.The scenes of the family rushing through the airport and just barely making the plane were good, and I found it amusing with the kids running down the jetway and one of them calling ""I got the window seat!"" The scenes with Kevin discovering he was alone and smiling ""I made my family disappear"" was where reality really sorta flew out the window. A real 8 year old would've been scared right then, whether he had a fight with his family the previous night or not.There were still some amusing scenes along the way with Kevin's antics around the house, him thinking the furnace in the basement is a monster, him going through his brother's stash, eating a big bowl of ice cream while watching the Grinch, and then him pretending to be the man of the house and putting on aftershave, thus leading to his famous hands on his cheeks scream. Alot of those are things an 8 year old would enjoy doing while home alone, that is if his family didn't mysteriously disappear without explanation and remain gone for days on end. That, like I said before, would've gotten a real 8 year old frightened. However, you could also view all of this as just the fantasy of an 8 year old, which is why the movie was quite popular at the time, and why I enjoyed it when I was young.Also amusing was Kevin going grocery shopping with his conversation with the suspicious cashier. Also amusing was the scene of him asking a pharmacist if the toothbrush on sale was approved by the American dental association and not her or her boss knowing. That scene also has one of Kevin's run-ins with the rumored murderer neighbor Marley. This leads to another one of the movie's goofs when Buzz said at the beginning of the movie that Marley was a murderer who just didn't have enough concrete evidence to put him away. Yet later on when Buzz is talking to his and Kevin's sister in Paris about why he's not worried about Kevin being home alone, he says how they live on a street where absolutely nothing dangerous or criminal ever happens. I guess Buzz had forgotten then about Marley.Other implausibilities include when Kevin's family in Paris discovering Kevin being left home, they cannot find one person they know back home in Chicago who could check on him. And, the police provide being useless too. After one of them is told on the phone by Kevin's mother that her 8 year old son has been abandoned, the officer repeats her request ""you want me, to check on him, to see if he's ok?"" as if it was a weird thing for a mother to ask when her 8 year old has been left alone and defenseless.Kevin turns out not to be so defenseless though with Burglars Harry and Marv when he rigs a bunch of traps for them and defends his home. That's the most famous part of the movie, and also the most implausible and unrealistic. It never occurred to Kevin to just call the police. I guess that may also be due to the police in their town being useless, such as their reaction to Kevin's mother asking to check up on him. The police in Kevin's town being useless may explain why Kevin never heard from them when he got the pizza guy to think that there was a shooter in the house threatening him and causing him to run to his car all crazy freaked out. And due to the pizza guy's freaked out reaction, he believed that there was a real shooter in the house, he wasn't smart enough to realize that Kevin was only playing a movie with a shooting going on. Normally after something like that, the pizza guy would go to the police and they would then immediately come to the house.Good movie in parts, but those gosh darn implausibilities.",Home Alone
221,nmp381,"An enjoyable movie, ONLY for the Holidays though",7,19 October 2000,"Home Alone is certainly not the best comedy ever made, however it has to be one of the best Holiday films to watch. Culkin gives a funny, cute personality to his character. The mirror scene is a classic by now and its great fun to watch at Christmas with young kids. Only thing about this movie which holds it back, is that there's really no other time, other than Christmas where you'll want to watch Home Alone. The sequels should not have been made though, one time is enough of watching a young kid practically decapitate 2 adult robbers. 7.5/10",Home Alone
222,someokiedude,"A Classic, In The Deepest Sense of The Word.",8,28 December 2020,"Home Alone is another film that screams the word classic. It's another case of a well known writer and director working together and somehow having it work miraculously well. It certainly doesn't approach Fincher and Sorkin's collaboration on The Social Network. But it's a good film, and a classic in its own right, as mentioned before.John Hughes' script showcases his knack for capturing small, human moments and also shows his uncanny ability to write kids and adolescents, and as gut bustingly funny as this film could be, I found that those small moments were far more touching than I remember it being. The film is also well known for its comedy and one of the most beautifully realized instances of slapstick ever put to film, one that was no doubt inspired by the Looney Tunes and The Three Stooges. Columbus' direction also showcases the touch of a competent and talented director. Much like his mentor Steven Spielberg, he has a unique gift for capturing the wonder and awe of a strange situation, but also showcasing the humor of a situation.The acting in the movie is also surprisingly well handled. Macaulay Culkin is surprisingly charismatic and charming in his role as young Kevin McCallister, capturing a sly cleverness, while also maintaining a childhood innocence. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are also excellent as the comically inept Harry and Marv, who I should again mention remind me of Looney Tune characters like Wile E. Coyote or Sylvester the Cat, two determined, but completely incompetent in their excursions, and much of the film's comedy comes from their antics and the fact that despite their determination, they just aren't good at what they do, and they're outwitted by a young kid who's more competent than they are.In short, it's a Christmas film that still holds up all these years later. It's deeply felt, yet thoroughly entertaining film that captures the spirit of Christmas well, in all of the good tidings and feelings that it brings.Merry (belated) Christmas everyone.",Home Alone

226,AW_McGOWAN,A Heartfelt Christmas Comedy For Everyone,8,11 December 2020,"""Home Alone"" might be cinema's last great live-action slapstick comedy, and the first in a long line of family oriented holiday movies from the 1990s. Coming out in the decade's first year, the John Hughes-written, Chris Columbus-directed movie was an unexpected blockbuster that quickly became a modern classic.Macaulay Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, ""Home Alone's"" mischievous, but good-intentioned eight-year-old hero. After getting into a fight with his family the night before they are supposed to leave on a Christmas vacation, Kevin wishes that his family would disappear. Coincidentally, his parents accidently forget him when they hurriedly leave for the airport the next morning.Kevin wakes up to find that his wish came true and immediately makes the most of it, eating junk food, staying up late, and watching R-rated movies with no supervision. All is fun until a criminal duo known as the Wet Bandits start eyeing the McCallister household for robbery. The Bandits, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), figure out that Kevin is home alone and attempt to hit the house with the kid inside. It is thus up to Kevin to defend it.And defend it he does. Kevin sets up outrageous booby traps to essentially torture the antagonists during their heist. This is where the slapstick comes in, as Harry and Marv are burned, tripped, whacked, and ""shot at"" by the boy. Many of the injuries would probably leave the characters in the hospital - if not the grave - but the movie keeps moving along to our delight. It is a hilarious sequence that quietly joins the ranks of iconic movie climaxes.In the spirit of John Hughes and Chris Columbus, ""Home Alone"" is not exclusively for kids. The main character might be a child, but its depiction of childhood is neither patronizing nor obscure. People of all ages can enjoy the movie, whether they are kids, parents, or average moviegoers watching apart from a family structure.Still, a heartfelt family theme weaves the film together. Beneath its comedic surface, there is a warm message of familial love that solidifies ""Home Alone"" as a Christmas classic. The whole idea of seemingly good parents leaving their children behind on a vacation is a bit incredulous, but once Kevin's mother (Catherine O'Hara) realizes that he is missing, her determination for returning to him feels very true. Both characters ultimately learn lessons in the end.The movie thus asks the audience to suspend our disbelief to a certain extent, but we willingly do so without even realizing it. Once again, the film centers on a child and consequently tells most of the story through a child's perspective. It takes place in the real world, but warrants an element of impracticality. Through that subtly fantastical and vivacious lens, ""Home Alone"" effectively becomes both timeless and magical.",Home Alone
227,catfarmer1358,"""Home Alone"" Not Just a Christmas Movie!",10,17 September 2018,"I have loved Home Alone ever since I was a little kid. I don't remember a Christmas where I haven't watched the movie. The plot is perfect and the way the actors portray the characters seems like a real family/group of people. I feel as if I have a real connection to the McCallister family and I feel like I am part of the family. Perhaps it's because I'm an only child and maybe the black sheep of my family but I feel a strong connection to Kevin and I understand what he's going through. I also like the adults in the movie even if they are horrible for leaving Kevin home alone. I am glad that Hine Alone was made when it was because the plot would be virtually impossible today.

231,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,The Godfather of Dental School Training Videos,10,17 October 2020,"If you attended dental school in 1989 you likely watched this cautionary tale that was required viewing for aspiring dentists. Then-American Dental Association president R. Malcolm Overbey contracted with legendary screenwriter John Hughes to create the best dental-centric work of art ever seen. After word of mouth (no dental pun intended) spread until 20th Century Fox snatched up the rights, the rest became holiday history.The film opens by highlighting the maxillofacial 24k styling of one Mr. Harry (Joe Pesci) in cop costume, his bling blinking in the gleam of the McCallister home and its high-class furnishings. Next a bullying montage features the prominent orthodontics of another McCallister who derides star Kevin (Macaulay Culkin) by stating ""You're what the French call les incompetents.""Attempting to educate future dentists by showing them that despite their soon-to-be-acquired riches and mansions they must still control their bratty kids, the picture continues the dental hijinks by having lone wolf (in the house cavities built) Kevin's first concern (after the shock of losing his family subsides) being that he cannot locate his toothbrush.Kevin decides (wisely, per the ADA) to risk both kidnapping and police capture in order to purchase a new toothbrush. Almost home free, Kevin asks the million dollar question despite the substantial risk: ""Is this toothbrush approved by the American Dental Association?""While Kevin's brutal series of psychotic traps ensnares damp bandits Harry and Marv (Daniel Stern) in the most depraved torture chamber since Corbin Bernsen's portrayal of The Dentist, the ultimate coup de grace is Old Man Marley's snow shovel to the grill. However, it was one of Kevin's earlier hazards that knocked out Harry's gold tooth, leading to a shocking twist that was a precursor to the Sixth Sense some years later.While the sexist among us may have assumed Peter McCallister (John Heard) was the rich dentist responsible for the family wealth, it was clearly his wife Kate (Catherine O'Hara) who had to be the millionaire mouth doctor. After all, no self-respecting dentist would have held a gold tooth found on the floor up to his mouth.10/10",Home Alone

235,Incendid,Perhaps the best live-action kids film out there.,7,25 July 2014,"Home Alone, is known worldwide, we all know the story and we all know at least one line from the movie, and it was only lately that i decided it deserved to be re watched, and so i did and i found that the film was great but it did have some errors which i will discuss in this review. Anyway to start this short review, lets have a look at the story, we have Kevin McCallister, the child of (even though they never say) rich couple who are going on a vacation to Paris, in the madness of trying to get out of the house, the leave Kevin behind. Then we have some burglars who want to rob the place, and Kevin must defend his house. Now, i found this to be believable but some of the things that happen throughout the story are strange, such as (i think) we sometimes see the world as Kevin sees it such as the Oven(?) downstairs and Old Man Marley at the grocery store. These were just some unusual points in the movie, which is nor a good or bad thing. You could say the whole movie is about growing up and becoming more selfless rather than being selfish, and this is a good message to tell, it also seems to make an entertaining movie. Onto directing, what can i say Chris Columbus is a good director when it comes to kids films, he is definitely a safe choice. Now i think i will mention a few mistakes in the movie i noticed such as- Buzz could not have seen Old Man Marley from where he was standing, as the curtains were half closed and Old Man Marley was on the far right, not in the middle of the window, therefore Buzz could never had seen him. Also one other thing, was the church scene sort of like in Kevin's mind showing Old Man Marley coming from the dark, scary side over to Kevin's light, nice side, just what i saw in the lighting. Anyway to sum up the film i personally think it is one of the best kids films out there and is a must watch for everybody. Home Alone gets a 7/10.",Home Alone

It would be easy to side with Joe Pesci and Stern as the bad guys when faced with an obnoxious smart ass kid, but Culkin shows us his vulnerability through the loneliness of being left at home, and it is this that works well.

245,DrEbert,Quite simply one of the greatest family comedies ever made,9,24 February 2008,"Roger Ebert gave ""Home Alone"" a mere 2-1/2 stars, which is the same rating he gave ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" another one of my childhood favorites. (For comparison, he gave that same rating to mediocre movies like ""Six Days, Seven Nights"" and ""Superman III."") The reasoning he gave for giving ""Home Alone"" that rating was that he liked the first half of the movie, but then didn't like the burglar/booby traps plot in the second half. At first, I was going to say that Roger Ebert has simply lost touch with his inner child, but I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt.I watched ""Home Alone"" today after many years and I still loved it and I still laughed, even though I had practically memorized the movie as a kid and still remembered it all. As a kid, I remember always wanting to get to the ""cool"" stuff when watching this movie, the parts about pulling pranks on the pizza man or booby-trapping the house. I'd fast-forward through much of the first half (even though I liked it). This time around, I had a new-found appreciation for the beginning half, where we get to see how an 8-year-old copes with waking up and discovering that his family has disappeared. I still LOVE the second half of the movie, but I saw the first half in a new light this time.I think the reason why that happened is the same reason why Roger Ebert didn't like the second half of the movie. As an adult, one watches family movies to remember what it was like to be a kid, to remember the dreams of being grown-up and independent and the silly little fears of things in the basement. That's what the first half of the movie offers and it works for both kids and adults; kids relate to it and adults reminisce about it.The second half is for the kids (and for the inner child). Sure, it's pretty outrageous to see an 8-year-old devise clever booby-traps that work like clockwork and are encountered in precisely the right order. Ebert says that our little hero gets too smart and doesn't have the budget for his fancy booby-trapping. Maybe, but that's not the point. Adults watch and say, ""Man, this can never happen."" But kids say, ""Man! I wish I could do that!"" It is, after all, one reason why we go to the movies: to see things that can only happen in the movies. As a kid, words could not describe how awesome it was to see an 8-year-old take on two adult burglars and pummel them (especially after one of the burglars had the nerve to say, ""Kids are stupid""). It is a child's fantasy come true.That is why this movie was so popular when it came out, why it stayed #1 at the box office for 12 straight weeks. It's also why every family movie from the 1990's tried (and failed) to imitate it. Kids love it because it's a dream come true and parents love it because it's a dream remembered.(By the way, parents, I should warn you that kids will want to try and imitate our little hero and, unless you want your house booby-trapped, I'd advise that you let them know not to do that. Also, there's one scene where our hero celebrates his new-found freedom by watching a gangster movie, where he sees one gangster blow another one away with a tommy gun, a scene that scares him and makes him remember his mom. Older kids and adults will laugh at the scene (because it's way over the top), but little kids may actually get scared. Just a caution.)Macauly Culkin is great as our hero, Kevin. He was a pretty talented child star and it's too bad his career never really went anywhere. Our two burglars are Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, who are the Pinky and The Brain of breaking and entering. I think Stern's character, Marv, was supposed to be the funnier one, but I personally liked Pesci's character, Harry, more. One thing I love is the way he's muttering nonsense under his breath every time he gets caught in a booby-trap, since he can't curse in a family movie. (Actually, true story, he had to do that because he had just finished filming his Oscar-winning and totally awesome role in ""Goodfellas"" as a foul-mouthed, quick-tempered, homicidal maniac of a gangster and so he was quite prone to cursing.)What can I say? I LOVE this movie! It makes me a kid again.",Home Alone

The first movie of Home Alone I think is the best Home Alone movie and it is exactly what I'll never get sick of it even though I've been watching it over and over again. The funny thing about this movie is that there is so many people in the McCallister family and Kevin is the only one who causes trouble. And when he wakes up the next morning of their vacation in France he finds that his family has left him Home Alone. I really like the two idiots Harry and Marv and they are the guys that makes this movie so good. And of course the guy who people thinks is a shovel slayer and Kevin always screams when he sees him but eventually him and the shovel slayer make friends. I like the part when he has to make a battle plan to defeat the two idiots who were going to break in his house one night and the battle plan music is very good and catchy. I think this movie deserves to be a quite good movie for 1990 and I always thought this movie was made in 2000 because it is so good. This deserves at least a 6.,Home Alone
248,eline-hoskens,Perfect for when you're home alone on Christmas,7,10 December 2013,"Doesn't this movie make you all warm and tingly inside? Okay, the story is not entirely credible but it's a good idea, the story build-up is pretty straight-forward and easy so it can appeal to a very wide audience. You've probably seen this movie a thousand times by now and there's a big chance you didn't get tired of it. If you love Christmas and the Christmas spirit, you'll probably love this. For those who haven't seen the movie yet: the story is about a little boy whose parents go to Paris for Christmas and forget their son. He wakes up all alone and his mother only discovers she forgot him when she's already on a departed plane. A burglar duo, fully aware of their departure, drops by to steal some valuables and the little boy Kevin as ""new man of the house"" feels responsible and obliged to defend his fortress of solitude.It has all the cuddly and mellow themes of Christmas, like unconditional love for family and friends, the destructive power of prejudice and fear, values like charity, mercy and generosity. And what's wrong with a little corniness in life?",Home Alone
249,Kranadon65,Love this classic but really hate the family,8,2 December 2020,"This is a timeless classic . Hard to believe it's 30 years old. I remember how I laughed seeing it in the theatre. Macaulay Culkin is a delight to watch in his 10 yo innocence as are comic veterans Pesci and Stern. When they are on the screen , it's the best. Now the bad part , Culkins movie family the McCaliisters , OMG talk about insenistive uncaring jerks , From his parents to his siblings to his cousins to his freeloading ahole of an Uncle. They just insult and are so mean to Kevin(Culkin)at every turn . His parents don't seem to give a rats arse about him ,
and all of the other family members are as equally rude and mean . The uncle gets my award for the most revolting irritating character ever. And let's not forget Buzz the older brother , if I had an older brother like that ,I would have disowned him out of my life once I grew up and left the house. The uncle I would have kicked him so far his ancestors would have felt it . They are the hardest scenes to watch when they are on screen since it's all mean and not funny . It's no wonder Kevin wishes they would disappear. Another character though who helps the movie along is the old man next door played by Roberts Blossom , he has a warm scene with Kevin in a church that really makes the movie shine . He shows up at the end too to save Kevin.I dont know why they had to have the family be such cruel , disgusting people.
Anyway I give it an 8/10 .",Home Alone
250,moviescriticnet,a classic Christmas comedy,8,11 December 2015,"Christmas is coming, therefore remembering and reviewing some classic seasonal movies is imperative. The first one shall be Home Alone, the classic comedy for all family that made Macaulay Culkin a superstar in the age of 10. The movie even got two Oscar nominations (music song and score) as well as two golden globes nominations (best comedy movie and best performance by Macaulay Culkin). As probably everyone already knows this movie is about an 8-year old who must protect his home from a pair of burglars when he is accidentally left home alone by his family during Christmas vacation. The fact that he manages to bring terror to the burglars is of course completely unrealistic but no one cares since this is an absolutely hilarious comedy (although not a very believable one). There are some classic scenes that will have you rolling on the floor laughing even if you remember them, so it's strongly suggested as it's a classic Christmas comedy indeed.",Home Alone
251,9thgraders,The best film,9,11 February 2019,"It's a comedy and family film. It was released in 1990.It's directed by Chris Columbus and John Hughes is the director.The main actors are Macaulay Culking who plays Kevin, Joe Pesci who plays Harry and Daniel Stern who plays Marvin. Kevin is a boy and he lives in England. He lives in the biggest home with his family (cousins, uncle...)For Christmas his family go to Paris and ...go watch the film!I'm a fan of this film, it's so funny. Kevin is brave and he doesn't get scared. He builds traps to keep burglars. It's an amazing film!Kevin runs around. it's a great cast because Macaulay Culking (Kevin) is the most talented actor.The soundtrack is stressful. It's a great film and to me it's the best film I've ever seen. The cast is perfect, the music is perfect but there aren't visuals effects.",Home Alone
252,travelertoon,A Christmas Classic,9,16 December 2020,"Okay this is my first time reviewing something live action, this time a movie. I would probably review more live action stuff; but I would stick to animation. So the main plot of the movie is that Kevin Mcallister, the main character, is all home alone. From how Kevin's parents forgot to take him on a vacation to Paris, France. Kevin then has to deal with two burglars, Harry and Marv from robbing his house. This is a fun Christmas classic that is a favourite of mine, and a lot of other people.Let's start off with the ani-; oh wait a second this is live action. Okay how about the acting and special effects. It's really good the characters do a great job on their roles; Kevin being a mischievous kid, and Harvey and Marv being funny comedic villains. The way that Kevin prepares these traps against these two burglars; looks really cool to be honest. Now let's look at the writing; the main plot is that Kevin is all home alone. The movie utilizes this plot very well with how Kevin reacts to it; being excited at first and then scared when the two burglars come. This movie is also very funny; like Kevin at first messing around in the house, and watching a mafia movie. As well as the slapstick; the two burglars have to endure. It's pretty heartwarming; like when Kevin reunites with his family.Let's review the characters; Kevin is a great main character. He is a mischievous kid who is pretty smart for how he protects his house. As well as Harry and Marv being ridiculously funny villains; like I mentioned earlier. There is also Kevin's family; they're not that great of characters. Well even though I don't think Kevin McCallister's family are hate worthy; they're pretty flat and mean spirited. Even if they do care about Kevin. In addition there is also Old Man Marley who turns out to be misunderstood. So overall I find Kevin, Old Man Marley, and the two burglars; Harry and Marv to be great characters. While finding Kevin McCallister's family to just be there.So my overall thoughts are that it's a great movie, and a great Christmas classic. The acting, and special effects are good. The main plot is funny and heartwarming. Most of the characters serve their purpose well. Overall I would give it a 9/10.Also I know Home Alone has sequels; the first sequel, ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"" is good for instance. While the rest I would rather forget.Edit: December 28, 2020; This will be my last review this year. Merry late Christmas everyone, and a happy new year.",Home Alone
253,lilballa08,Hilarious movie with a tight cast!!!,10,22 August 2006,"There is no film to put beside Home Alone by way of comparison. It is a film genre of it's own. I read and hear reviews of this movie that express disgust and horror and I picture John Hughes chuckling. This was the intent, it was meant to upset the status quo and in ""politically correct"" times that we live in, isn't it a small surprise to see this film come to the forefront again? This is a movie that will freak out the uptight for as long as it exists in any media. It was meant to. As much as ""Clockwork Orange"" talked about ""ultraviolence"" this movie is all about ultra-bad pranks. We can numb ourselves to sex and violence but Home Alone is a movie you just will never get used to. There will be something in this movie that will get to you. As a last resort to make sure everyone is offended before you leave the theatre, John includes the always discussed paint can scene. No reason for this scene, except to make sure he gets you and also to make sure you leave talking about it. Obviously filmed on a budget, and using Hughe's stock cast, this is a movie simply about a young kid whose parents forget him while they go on vacation. All the characters are bizarre in one way or another. This movie reminds me of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" in that everyone in the film has something odd about them and both movies joyfully celebrate these uniquenesses. Not a movie to buy for Mom on Mother's Day... but worth seeing just to say you did.",Home Alone
254,jsn_hylnd,My most favorite movie of all time.,10,20 May 2010,"I just got to say that this is the best movie ever made and it's my favorite movie of all time It's funny, entertaining, unrealistic which makes it great I know a lot of people say this movie is unrealistic but I think thats what makes the movie so much fun and I'm sure john hughes was aware that this movie was unrealistic and I think a lot of movies should be like this. Whenever I want to escape reality for a couple of hours I pop this movie in because it's a childhood favorite and I grew up watching this movie. I am upset that I never got to see this movie in theaters but I did catch the sequel in theaters back in 92 and I will review that movie next because I love that one just as much. Anyway I highly recommend home alone 1 and 2 for everyone. home alone 3 is tolerable but I don't highly recommend it and don't see 4 please unless you want to watch garbage.",Home Alone

John candy is also a pretty small role but really good. The mom is very good to but that big really of a role when you think about it and buzz of course has a great performance as a bully.

257,S-Reisner,A great family comedy,10,27 January 2006,"There's nothing better to watch on Christmas time than Home Alone.Its a funny, well written family film with good slapstick and idiot burglars that stole the show. Really the credit for this film being so funny goes to Daniel Stern, he's probably the best Movie comedian since John Belushi and he plays a great idiot.The film is about two idiot burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) hitting every house on a block except for one because Kevin, the brilliant nine year old fooled them that someone was there and they skipped it, then when they find out that Kevin is the only one there they set out to rob the house, but they'll have trouble getting through Kevin's little house of fun.Watch it, you won't be disappointed, the slap stick for such a young kid is great, Pesci and Stern are hysterical and it's all good.",Home Alone
258,rie-63184,Christmas film,9,27 July 2016,"There are two reasons why ""Home Alone"" was such a big success. The first is that it is about a kid who outsmarts grown-ups, something that happens every day, only there is a worldwide conspiracy of silence. The second is John Williams's magical score, which elevates the film way above slapstick family fare to something more serious and regarded.Moreover, there is an important message that family is what really matters to a child, or to anyone, and having them home for the holidays is better than wandering a huge house all by yourself.There are some films that work best at Christmas and this is one of them.",Home Alone

Sometimes we walk down dead end allies, not a hope in the world, eyes dead to all that belong to justice and peace. We look up at the skies, but a cloud cover destroys all we can hope for in the stars. There is not much life around us any more, and indeed, all things seemed to have faded into blurry fog and remain loose forms, colored in black and white. Where is the happiness? Where the dreams? Where the love of days past and future? Through the years we all may be together if the fates allow - That is the one statement that holds true to all things. Our family may leave us Home Alone, we may have no real friends in this world, we may scream to let Munch know we are still alone, but through the years we all will be together, just so long as we can make friends with that which scares us most. Christmas is about setting traps to destroy our enemies. Have you discovered Christmas? Merry Christmas, whatever day it be!!!",Home Alone

Its about this kid who wishes his parents would disappear then he becomes man of the house and has to deal with these retarded burglars who just are dying to break in. Then he must rid of them forever. If you aren't watching it now, you should. It's really worth watching. So if you don't own it, go rent Home Alone (under Comedy section), enjoy it and if you love it, own it. If you love Home Alone, you'll love Home Alone 2. And his other films.

Movies are entertainment aren't they? Home Alone is an ENTERTAINING movie. And in this time where family breakups and divorces are rampant, this movie is a refreshing look on what families are all about, and its importance (though it was made more than a decade ago).Because this kind of 'feel good' movie is so rare, I rate it 9/10.",Home Alone

268,2001mmFilm,No Christmas Without Home Alone,9,27 December 2020,"I laughed hysterically at this movie when I was little, rolling over the floor in my living room type hysterical. Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) stepping bare-foot on nails or getting their heads blowtorched won't ever escape my memory or my heart. It's a childhood movie, therefore I don't think I can ever regard as it anything but special. The director, Chris Columbus, is mostly to thank for this. He made it his duty for Home Alone to one day become a Christmas Classic. The whole film just oozes nostalgia and warmth, and is photographed by Julio Macat, with this slightly fuzzy image. Almost every shot in the film incorporates something that is either red or green, in order to assist in making it feel 'Christmasy' for the viewer's subconscious. Of course, John Williams score adds a lot to this magic. The composition; 'Somewhere In My Memory' proves to become very emotional, especially if you've grown up with the movie as a kid. Once you get a little older, the piece hits you more profoundly.The script is awesome, as is anything written by John Hughes at the height of his powers. There's so many funny quotes and moments, from this huge cast of characters. No-one in the movie is dull, and that's saying something for a family as large as the McAllister's. Macauley Culkin single-handedly carries the movie, commendable since he was only nine during shooting. Uncle Frank's (Gerry Bamman's) ""look what you did, ya little jerk!"" or Johnny's (Ralph Foody's) ""too bad Acey ain't in charge no more"" (in a great in-universe gangster flick) are both iconic.The slap-stick humour at the end is still funny to this day, and that's compliments of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. I love these two actors, and both help make Home Alone what it is. That's why the sequel works too. Everyone comes back, and it retains the same quality from before. It's a case of lightning in a bottle, caught twice, although the original is slightly better.A little older now, I appreciate the tender moments in Home Alone. When the movie's really going, it can actually become surprisingly mature. There's a scene where Kevin (Macauley) has doubts on whether or not his family will ever come back to him, and during a nighttime stroll, he walks past a home where a festive family dinner is taking place. He stares through the windows as John Williams' gentle music is playing, and it's impressively heartfelt. This is followed up by another stand-out moment, where he looks up almost hesitantly at a Church before entering. He's a kid, yet he still feels the gravity of his situation, and the importance of faith and redemption. This ties in to the Old-Man Marley (Roberts Blossom) subplot, and their conversation in the aforementioned church is unlike anything you see in modern family films... Of course, the mother (Catherine O'Hara) finally reuniting with her son is very true and wholesome too.There's trivial plot-holes and illogical scenarios, and the movie, on occasion, sways in terms of tonality. But it's a classic in the end. Any of these detractors are minor, and don't diminish the experience I have watching it each and every December. Of course, when you've seen enough films, you can't say Home Alone is perfect. But from a sentimental point of view, yes it is.",Home Alone

I'm not going to try and defend Culkin's acting, except to say that worse child performances than his have been considered charming (as in the somewhat overrated ""A Christmas Story"").  This movie is charming, memorable, indeed touching, and perfectly paced so that the hilariously extreme violence that is its trademark (a really fresh perspective on slapstick, in my opinion) starts late and builds to an actual climax.  By contrast, most of the movies in this genre drag on and on with no real development and little cohesion, and could end at almost any arbitrary moment, i.e. ""Baby Geniuses"", ""Mouse Hunt"", ""Look Who's Talking Too"".

Amazing lead child actor, great side characters, stupidly funny villains, some really funny and really heartfelt moments, brilliant score, and everything else.This movie is must for all Christmas lovers. Although the story may not look like your typical Christmas celebration, it teaches us to love and cherish our time with family for as long as we have them.The story is about little Kevin who gets left behind when his family goes on a vacation. Now alone at home he has to look after himself. He finds out that 2 burglars are planning to break into his house at night. So he prepares a grand welcome for them with so many booby-traps.

291,berringercross,"""How low can you get giving Kris Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve? What's next? Rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?""",10,21 December 2018,"A Museum of Artistic Accomplishment in Cinema (M.A.A.C.) ReviewHome Alone / Director: Chris Columbus / Career Catalog #3 / Review #00019/10After a series of unforeseeable events, an eight-year-old boy is left alone at Christmas time and must contend with two neighborhood crooks. This ridiculous premise is made quasi-believable by the warmth the writers imbue in their creation and the characterization of childhood innocence star Macaulay Culkin brings to the screen. While his family members are painted with familiar colors, they never devolve into the realm of stereotypes or one-dimensional representations. They function well together and it's easy to imagine they have been interacting with (and getting on the nerves of) each other long before the camera intruded upon their presence. Catherine O'Hara's iconic histrionics over realizing she left one of her children behind are particularly fascinating. Her roundabout road trip to return home provides a good counterpoint to Culkin's main storyline.Then you have the acerbic wit of Joe Pesci thrown into the mix. It's hard to believe he filmed this role in the same year ""Goodfellas"" was released. The two performances are such polar opposites of each other and yet, when combined, stand as a testament to Pesci's abilities as an actor. His comedic compatibility with Daniel Stern is off the charts and it's hard to see anyone else filling their roles as admirably as they did.I really like the fact that the filmmakers never took the easy route and wound up exploring more than one fear for our youthful hero. Not only does he have the fear of criminals invading his home (however bungling the burglars might be), he also has to deal with his fear of the basement and his fear of murderous local legend Marley whom he continually runs into over the course of his exploits. It's not just fear that Culkin's character has to tackle, but the day-to-day aspects of living a life on his own. The filmmakers were aware that sometimes the simplest of things can make the funniest of scenes. From torn grocery bags spilling their contents over a suburban sidewalk to the application of aftershave, there are a thousand little details other films would overlook that make this one a memorable experience.This film has all the magic of the month of December in one place, from hectic holiday travel schedules to the inarguably argumentative confrontations uptight relatives will inevitably share. I can't imagine the holiday season passing without indulging in this yuletide favorite. It just doesn't feel like Christmas until I've had my fill of purposefully cartoonish violence and heartwarming heartland schmaltz.On a side note, as this is my first cinematic review, I would like to say that it is my firm belief you get out what you are willing to put into a film. No more, no less. Everyone has a different idea of what makes a film important or enjoyable because everyone has a different set of experiences they have lived through which color their perception of what they see and hear. You'll never read the words ""pretentious,"" ""overrated,"" or ""the Emperor's new clothes"" in one of my reviews. Many people misuse the word ""pretentious"" when they actually mean ""snobbish."" Many people misuse ""overrated"" and ""the Emperor's new clothes"" when they actually mean ""I don't like this film and I can't imagine why anyone else would either."" These statements are limited ideological viewpoints which cheapen the medium of cinema as a whole.Many people forget that critical analysis is nothing more than the opinion of one person. There are no set-in-stone rules for any avenue of art, nor should there be. Creation is as wide and as varied as human imagination itself. Your opinion . . . my opinion . . . anyone's opinion from that of a professional critic to an armchair reviewer should never be accepted as fact or gospel. Good reviewers understand this concept and often provide for interesting reads. Bad reviewers who forget or scoff at this concept become nothing more than parodies that waste time, effort, and space. So I bid you good watching . . . and good reviewing . . . at this joyous time of the year.©2018 berringercrossreviews",Home Alone

I highly recommend watching this movie in a close circle of friends and family. The main idea which is given in the film is that is never too late to stop being afraid of anything, even if it is a simple fear of spiders or fear of relationships.Kevin, the main character of the movie, has great strength, intelligence and creativity. He is able to protect his house against burglars and leave any fears even though he is only eight. The acting is believable, and I especially imagined myself in the shoes of his mother as she desperately tried to find a way home when all the flights were booked.Kids are quite interested in this movie.

All of the actors in Kevin's ""family"" are very good. Uncle Frank is an annoying jerk (as he is supposed to be as his part is written) so the actor turns in a good performance causing the audience to truly dislike him, as intended. I do have some issues with the story line of this movie though. Kevin is portrayed as a troublemaker which he is most definitely NOT! BUZZ is the troublemaker! (Well played by Devin Ratray, the audience is EXPECTED to dislike Buzz). The way Buzz treats Kevin is deplorable. Buzz is the true BRAT! Buzz is the instigator of all of the ""troubles"" yet he gets away with it and the relatively innocent Kevin gets all the blame. Buzz is the one who should be punished, not Kevin! This shows bad parenting on the part of Kevin's parents, they punish the wrong son! A good parent would realize that Buzz is the instigator. This bad parenting sends a wrong message. I DESPISE Buzz!

It's highly entertaining, and Macaulay Culkin does as good an acting job as any child actor can be expected to, especially when he's carrying the whole film.HOWEVER: The treatment of Kevin by his family has not aged well. At the beginning of the film, his parents stand idly by while his uncle, brother and cousins verbally abuse him, angrily calling him a ""little jerk"" and a ""disease"" for doing nothing that was even that bad. This will not sit well with modern audiences, who will rightly say that if someone called their child that, they would bi*chslap them and kick them out of their house. The issue was not even addressed in the movie, the parents did nothing to defend him, and thus verbal abuse of small children was normalized, given that it's such a popular movie.

He also appears to be very strange, like when he asks if the toothbrush he purchases is approved by the American Dental Asscosiation, or when he runs in fear extremely loudly away from Old Man Marley. However, the pranks he pulls on the idiodic burglars are what made this movie okay, as well as when he scares away the pizza man by playing the voice of the man in the R rated movie. Who knows?

Now the kid is left to defend for himself as a couple of hungry Paedophiles try to break their way into his house and abduct him.The kid has only one friend about and that is his old neighbour the snow shoveller who is said to of done time in pelican bay for multiple felonies.In the end the film had a great twist where in fact the two suspected peados were really just trying to help the boy as the real peado was the snow shoveller.

312,RHewison,A timeless Christmas classic,7,13 January 2012,"Spending Christmas in sunny Australia threw my Christmas spirit array, and I needed something to make it feel more Christmassy. Home alone was the perfect film to do this. Watched by families every year, the film never fails to bring a smile to the face and a Christmas feeling in your heart.Released in 1990, the film is still a classic. However what I hadn't remembered was how slow the film is to get going. The vast majority of the film seems to concentrate on Kevin's adventures in the house but that's not why kids watch it, they want to see the bad guys meet their comic demise. It just felt a little dragged out before the action finally began. Likewise as much of a legend as Macaulay Culkin is, he just wasn't as good as I remembered. When he was trying to act sad, it just felt a bit wooden. He really came to life when he used comedy or was setting up the traps against the bad guys. In comparison to his family though, he was superb. The other group of actors were just slightly too dull for me and I didn't particularly enjoy their scenes.For me the two robbers were the highlight of the film. Two actors have never been picked so perfectly. Their timing, their facial expressions, their tone was just fantastic and even in my 20s, I still laughed out loud at their performances. The film is pretty basic but that's all it needs to be. The stunts are fun and childish and didn't need to use any special effects to make them any better. It's simple but just right.

The film undoubtedly has faults like any film and the fundamental basics are at times a little embarrassing as far as acting and continuity are concerned.However this film as good as it is has a personal value to me as a person. I watch this film once every year in the weeks leading up to Christmas because i used to watch it every day of December up to the 25th when i was a child so there may be a considerable amount of bias in this review and for that i apologise.The basic plot is frankly classic and as soon as you see the plot unfolding it is impossible not to be entertained.The over the top acting is at times good and at times bad but it is all tongue in cheek. The two criminals (Joe Pecsi and Daniel Stern) make up for little Macaulay Culkin who is good in his own way i suppose and while not as hilarious as his co stars of previous mention, he does have his moments.Then of course everybody's favourite part of the film, the pranks. Obviously it is why every child of the last 20 years of the existence of our universe loves the film. The fact that an 8 year old child could out wit and over come two adults for such a long period of time simply does not come to mind because how well the events of the film are set up. It seems like in reality this helpless rude and ignorant brat could not make toast for himself but com on...WHO CARES!!??I not to go to much into the story on the off chance that you are reading this without having watched the film.

325,benfizzsafc,Quality at Xmas,8,31 January 2014,"Home alone reviewHome alone is a warm, family comedy film made in 1990, it was written and produced by John Hughes and was directed by Chris Columbus. The main part of Kevin McCallister is played by Macaulay Culkin, his parents are played by John Heard and Catherine O'Hara and the villains (the wet bandits) are played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern. The signature tune is made by John Williams, musician of 'Star Wars', 'Harry Potter' and 'Lord of the Rings'. 20th Century Fox bought the plan for home alone from Warner Bros and upped the budget for the movie by $4 million, it turned out as a bargain for 20th Century Fox because it raked in $476,684,675 at the box office; and as of 2009, home alone was the highest grossing comedy of all time! The McCallisters go to Paris for Christmas, however their eight-year-old son Kevin is left behind after sleeping in and not being awoken but being forgotten...bad parenting! In the mother's defence, she moves Heaven and Earth attempting to get back to her son. At first, Kev loves being alone by himself in his house, eating junk food, jumping on beds, watching scary movies, going through his brothers personal belongings, without anyone telling to do otherwise. But eventually, the young boy has to fight for himself and his home as two wannabe robbers plan to raid his house. He does this while helping repair the broken family of a man who once scared the life out of him, can an eight-year-old really manage to do this? Mend, cook, clean and kick butt? After writing my Hobbit review I re-read my previous reviews, and of course I came across my Home Alone 2 review. It stated that the home alone's were really good Christmas films, and conveniently my parents had bought me the box set the previous day...good parenting! So I decided to do some Christmassy things (decorated the cake that my Grandad baked and put up my tree) whilst watching it. This movie is just as good as it's sequel, which means this film has to be quality because number two had an automatic advantage due to the fact it was in New York. This film is the first of it's kind, an individual, not repetitive, a breath of fresh air which I pointed out it's sequel review; John Hughes must have been just as tired as me with boring ol' movies that are remade every year, he must have had to rack his brains for a while in order to think up a plot like that, it's pure random gold! Anyway, I love this film, the plot is magic, the actors are magic, the music is magic and I think it well deserves to be the highest grossing comedy of all time! I think that's why it's follow-up had to be something special, in order to not be one of the biggest movie let downs of all time, and that's why three and four were. So, Well done John Hughes and Chris Columbus (for one and two, not three and four because they were a massive let down.)

326,saxguygb,A Christmas Classic for Kids & Adults,8,4 November 2015,"I first saw this as a kid and I liked it (mostly for the slapstick during the last 30 minutes or so of the movie). As an adult, I still enjoy this movie a lot. However, I like it more for the atmosphere than for the comedy.The overall atmosphere of Home Alone is what I think adults might like most about this film. It just looks like Christmas with all of the lights, decorations and even the songs. It really gets you in the holiday spirit and just gives you that heartwarming feeling of Christmas.The slapstick comedy doesn't totally hold up for me. I don't find myself laughing at it as much, but I know kids like that stuff and even some adults, so if you like it, then that's totally fine.I have seen a couple of the original trailers for this movie and based on that, the film doesn't look like anything special or anything that good. It mostly focuses on the slapstick and doesn't look too promising, but Home Alone is so much more than that and I think that's the main reason why it was such a huge box office hit since it wasn't a major success with critics.To sum it up, Home Alone is a great Christmas film that is a prime example of not judging a book by its cover.

335,Susikovski,Calling this sadistic trash a Family Movie is sick,2,16 May 2005,"Okay, I can understand the basic setting here. A kid is left alone in a big home and gets to do what he wants, and beats up some bad guys though they're twice his size. I admit there's good potential for fantasy and storytelling here.But instead of being clever or funny, the movie is just plain obnoxious and idiotic. The kid is not cute but simply totally irritating. What's worse, most of the supposedly funny scenes in the film are based on him screaming and the burglars getting injured in all possible ways. I have no problem with cartoon violence existing, but this film stretched the limits in a sick and disgusting way. The problem is that Home Alone arrogantly combines cartoon violence with a high level of cinema realism, showing how emotionally detached movies in general have become. People who have no trouble enjoying this are the kind of people who used to get their kicks out of torturing animals or beating up their classmates when they were kids. More disturbingly, the same mentality shows through when footage of actual combat violence in faraway countries is shown in live TV. They're not my race or faith, they're not on my side, so it's not for real, see! Or, they're just criminals, so breaking their balls must be funny, right! I'll rather show my own kids some actual action movies with realistic violence than this kind of twisted ""Family movie"" comedy cruelty.",Home Alone

Whenever I rewatch it, I can't help but imagine ways I can outsmart bad guys by placing traps around my house. But the core of the film comes from the lessons that Kevin, the main character, learns. That family and kindness is some of the most important things.

Yes, it's a kid's movie, but I know plenty of adults(not including myself) who loved this film. It touches our hearts, and tickles our funny bones. Not to mention I think in one way or another we could relate to it. That's why it remains a classic Christmas comedy.Home Alone is not only one of the highest box office successes of all time, but it deserves more praise. Mac showed a talent that very little child stars have now-a-days. He brought in a great comedy about a boy who accidentally is left home alone when his family goes on vacation and takes on two burglars. Yeah, it's quit unrealistic about the burglars, but honestly, this is a terrific family film. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are the perfect comedy duo of two idiots who can't rob the place because a 8 year old child has out witted them and set some clever and very funny traps around the house.Please give this movie a chance, it's just terrific and I guarantee nothing but great laughs for you and the whole family.10/10",Home Alone

It's a lesson that you shouldn't leave your kids alone because bad things can happen during it. It's not the best movie, but it's definitely a decent movie with decent actors and funny story. Although, it is a little bit better than the second Kevin's movie, the Home Alone 2.

Although the first half or more of this movie is of the sort of humor that really turns me off, the revenge of the little guy is beautifully done, and the bad guys (who are delightfully inept) get exactly what's coming to them.If you enjoy the ""Coyote/RoadRunner"" cartoons, you'll certainly enjoy the latter portions of this movie.

Funny, well thought out traps, interesting story. Certainly watchable HOWEVER I hate his family. They are selfish and cold. I can understand that it symbolises the pre-Christmas stress but they call him names (not just the kids either) and don't seem to care whether he is fed or not. The parents fail to see that the other kids are bullying him. They stupidly don't even notice he's not with them for a while, they're a shame to the name of parenting. It leaves you feeling like he'd be better off alone (he certainly can handle himself).Also perhaps it's just me but the robbers are too dim-witted for my taste although maybe it adds to the comedy.I recommend you see Home Alone 3 if your not keen on this one.",Home Alone
353,mrsjinky2003,Love it!,10,19 April 2003,I loved this film when I first saw it over 10 years ago and I still love it today. This is one of the best Christmas films of all time and I never tire of watching it. The sheer splendour of the McAllister house is something to be marvelled at and one of my favourite scenes is when Kevin thinks he made his family disappear and runs wild through the house in celebration. Katherine O'Hara is the perfect mix of stern diciplinarian and worried parent as Kevin's mother and the late John Candy is great as Gus Polinski. I admit that the rest of the family are just there to make up the numbers but together they covincingly portray the nightmare family that Kevin can't wait to get away from. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern provide many a laugh as the bungling 'Wet Bandits' - although I don't find them as funny now as I did back in the day. Considering this is a kid's film I think it has stood the test of time reasonably well and this is mostly due to the production team as the film hardly looks dated at all. On top of that there is the excellent sound track which just makes the film even better.I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I look forward to watching it yet again this Christmas.,Home Alone

355,oliviaamoako,Classic movie,9,22 April 2019,"Home alone is a classic comedy and adventure movie which was made in 1990. It stars Macaulay Culkin (Kevin), who played Kevin. The movie does a great job showing some themes like broken family. Kevin is left alone by himself not on purpose, but he has to take responsibility. He is brave and doesn't fear anyone. Also, the movie raises a variety of scary moments. Strange noises play an important role, those normally scare children, but for Kevin it didn't scare him, when the bad guys were trying to kidnap him. He set traps for them meaning he was not scared of anyone. His ingenuity, approach to problems, kept the movie entertaining, and always kept me to my seat, wondering what would happen next. I would rate this a 4 out of 5, this is one of my favorite movies.",Home Alone

Well, yes, in different ways then others see it. I saw this recently after many years of not seeing it with a more critical mindset. It's a decent movie, but it's not great. You see, when I say it's a ""Christmas classic"" I don't mean it's a great movie. My reason for my usage of the term ""Christmas classic"" is because there aren't many great Christmas movies out there. Besides Elf, and Christmas Story, there aren't a lot of great Christmas movies.It certainly is a good movie to watch around Christmas, but it does have its flaws and problems. Macaulay Culkin is pretty good in this movie, as well as Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, but the rest of the actors aren't too good. The story has a lot of flaws. First of all, why doesn't Kevin go to a friends' house? Surely not everyone he knows has gone to Paris or something. He lives in a suburban neighbourhood in Chicago with a BUNCH of people, and he can't go to a friends' house? All these flaws I can kinda look past, but I can't pretend they're not there.

It's amazing how such a young actor can carry a movie with such seemingly effortless style and boundless enthusiasm. The movie works on so many levels.

When he woke up on Christmas morning, to his great enjoyment, he found out that his wish came true. (Exactly his family member went on a trip and had left him at home) But soon, Kevin discovered that a couple of thieves were targeting his home. Then he used his wits to trick the thieves and brought them to justice.Home Alone was a classic Christmas comedy that was a huge hit at the box office and with fans, And it will undoubtedly be a landmark film in many people's minds. I think the most successful part of the film is the carefully choreographed process by which children outmaneuver robbers. This process perfectly satisfies children's fantasies and adults' fun-seeking mindset.However, What I don't really like is that the two thieves are like ""tools"". One thing that they only needed to do was to trick by Kevin and made the audience laugh, which lake of further character description. Suppose if we know that the two burglars' family was exactly very poor, they targeted Kevin's home in order to get enough money to buy Christmas presents for their children and wife, Will we continue to make fun of the thieves? Although I know this is a movie for people to watch at Christmas when they reunion with their families and share the fun, I still think about these questions. All in all, this doesn't affect Home Alone to become a classic and excellent film.",Home Alone

I thought the cast was excellent, all the cast took their parts seriously but aside from Culkin, I think Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci deserve a lot of credit for playing two, idiotic and incompetent burglars who get their notorious reputation broken and humiliated because they get rumbled by many sets of booby traps that foil the bumbling bad guys.

372,Twizm,Funny and highly entertaining.,8,1 May 2002,"Home Alone (1990) Rating: 8/10It might be dumb and corny, but I've actually liked this highly entertaining flick. The plot's unbelievable, but who cares: it's funny! Macaulay Culkin plays 8 year-old Kevin, a misunderstood kid who lives in a big ass house with his family. They're about to leave for Paris, where they're gonna spend Christmas. About 20 people are running around the house, frenetically preparing for the trip. Kevin's mad at everyone, because no one pays attention to him, unless it's to yell at him. Hence, Kevin goes to sleep wishing that his whole family would disappear, and the next morning, they do! The thing is that they somehow woke up late, left home in a hurry, and hey, they forget Lil Kev! At first, he's happy as a monkey, but after a while, things get messy. Two dumbass robbers are planning to rob his house, but Kev ain't gonna let them!Okay, I know, this is one stupid story, but it's developed into a wonderful family film, as enjoyable as it is warmhearted. Mac Culkin is awesome in the lead. He really carries the film: he's got style, he's funny and he's even a good actor! Too bad his personal life screwed up, because he had the talent to become a grown-up movie star. The idiotic criminals are also really cool, because they cast good actors instead of some Ernest-style lame-o over-actors. Oscar-winner Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern (the narrator on The Wonder Years) are hilarious, but they also bring a bit more depth to what could have been cardboard characters. Pesci plays an aggressive thug, and anyone who's seen him in a Scorsese film knows how good he is at it. Stern plays a total dufus, and he's also really convincing at it. The film's humor might seem dumb, but hey, it's funny. John Hughes' screenplay has Kevin protecting his home by turning the thieves into human Wile E. Coyotes, and like the cartoon, it made me laugh. The gags might be old, but they're played with inventiveness, and the acting is always right. I just love this film, and you will too if you look beyond the fact that it's a family film.",Home Alone

Pesci and Stern are an amazing duel and really the only on screen duel that I actually like more is Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. Almost everything they said made me laugh out loud, especially Stern, who was Marv.Macauley Culkin had an amazing job in playing the bratty too cute kid.

376,ooohhhmmyyyy,A family comedy without the family,8,6 December 2008,"This movie tells a child's fantasy about having no family. Lot of kids wish they could have the whole house to themselves so they can do whatever they want and not be told what not to do or told what to do. Even I remember wishing the same. I envied Kevin but couldn't understand why he wanted his family back. They were all mean to him. Now I understand. Kevin does indeed do things his would never be able to do with his family around but then he starts to miss them when he sees Harry and Marv (two burglars) want to rob his house. They have already hit the other houses on the block and now they want to hit his. Now he has to do everything he can to keep them away by pretending people are home. But he can't even go to the police because he thinks he has actually made them disappeared and he would get in trouble with the police for making them go away. But what he didn't know is they all got up in a hurry because they all slept in and went to Paris and they took the shuttle in, not their cars. It's obvious Kevin a pain to his family and his parents don't listen, his siblings are mean to him, Buzz likes to play mean tricks on him. It's obvious Uncle Frank doesn't like him because he calls him names, won't let him watch a movie with the other kids, pulls his pants down in a deleted scene and didn't care he was left home alone. ""If it makes you feel any better, I forgot my reading glasses.""What's funny is Harry poses as a police officer and there he sees Kevin who is helpless and a trouble maker to the family. But when the family is away, he sees Kevin isn't as helpless and he is capable of what he didn't know what he was capable of. Kevin is obviously very bright and smarter than other kids his age despite not knowing how to pack a suitcase or tie his shoes. What kind of eight year old knows how to set all those traps and come up with a plan to catch those bad guys and figure out their moves? With his family away, Kevin grows up a little by concurring his fear of the basement, and showing his family he can take care of himself and what he is capable of and he isn't as helpless as they thought he was.",Home Alone

Not only was Macaulay Culkin not nearly as good as Alex D. Linz, but the fact that it took this franchise two entire movies to build the scene for number three was rather disappointing. The gags were simply too unrealistic, and the fact that these criminals could not outwit a small child is unbelievable. Not only was Alex D. Linz far cuter than Macaulay Culkin, but he was far better in the role of the abandoned child. The rare highlight in this movie is the break out appearance of John Candy.To fully grasp the quality distance between Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 3, all one must do is observe the fame to which each main actor went on to after their respective movie(s). Alex D. Linz was the star of the classic, Max Keeble's Big Move. On the other hand, Macaulay Culkin was linked to the late Michael Jackson.",Home Alone

As an adult this is a big reason I am beginning to hate Christmas. What a terrible cruel movie. There are literally no redeeming characters in this film except mabey the next door neighbor. I hate Mccaulley Culkin. I don't see how you can get any enjoyment out of this thing unless you are totally sadistic and have no conscience. Plus the fact it is the stupidest piece of garbage I've ever seen. It's not funny and there is nothing about this that says family entertainment. It's hard for me to believe that I seem to be the only one who feels this way. The characters in this thing, my god. It just makes me want to vomit, and then cry bitterly how people can be so cruel, kids and adults alike. Pieces of garbage every one of them.",Home Alone
380,virginia_vis,The coolest comedy film ever!!!,8,30 April 2005,"This film really is a must for both children and grown-ups! It tells the (funny) story of a boy who is left home at Christmas by his numerous family. When the house is attacked by robbers, he does his best (and succeeds) to keep the house safe and teach the robbers a lesson... and in the meantime, he has lots of fun!! Macaulay Culkin is fab as the boy and Joe Pesci plays a magnificent part as one of the robbers. This fun filled film will keep you posted in the couch, laughing with tears. And if you like true comedies, then this is perfect for you. So if you haven't yet seen Home Alone (I & II) you'd better get down to business!!! Enjoy!",Home Alone

""Home Alone"" is one of the funniest adn delightful Christmas films of all time. I would love to watch this movie again.So, the story is about a young boy named Kevin MacCallister who gets aaccidently left home during Christmas after his family goes to Europe. At first, Kevin loves the situation, but learns that two burglars are targetting the house.So, i watched this film yesterday and I enjoyed every second of it. The performance of Macaulay Culkin as Kevin is great and for an eight year old boy, he is very smart. The burglars, played by Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci, are also great and fun to watch.However, it does have it's problems. There are a couple of times where Kevin uses the TV to talk instead of speaking. I understand the situation, but there are at times where some of if could be cut out.Besides that, this movie was awesome. The performances were great and the hliarious moments where hilarious. I'll give it a 9 out of 10.",Home Alone

390,jamiecarle,Possibly the funniest film I've ever seen?,8,25 October 2005,"What can I say about Home Alone that nobody has ever said? Possibly nothing. Home Alone, to me, is possibly one of the funniest movies ever made. Yes it is full of sentimentality. Yes it is a good wholesome family movie. But it is as anarchic and destructive as any Predator or Clockwork Orange. Any film that gives gives a ten year old unconditional licence to p i s s their pants for a full ninety minutes without repercussion from their parents should always hold a place in our hearts.Macauley Culkin, no matter how much he may annoy us, is adamant of his willingness to be rid of the family unit. We all felt this when we were 11 years old and the fantasy of leaving our parents behind as we become ingratiated in our own behaviour upon the world is undeniable.I may be reading too much into a film that is full of the most basic humour in our nature, but if anyone out there is my age, I'm sure they will feel the same way.In Kevin MacCallister all our childish dreams come true. It's fantasy on the most base level. He takes care of himself, he thwarts the bad guy and he still does it with enough acumen to realise that growing up can' be done on our own. For example Kevin realises that preconceptions can be misjudged when old man Marley comes to his aid just as we're sure that he is also one of the bad guys.These are exactly the same choices we had to deal with when we were the same age, even if we didn't have to make them with quite the same repercussions.But all in all, no matter how much you want to read into this film, it will always be a movie when the little man wins. And we always need that in our lives, no matter how old we are.",Home Alone

The plot is slightly unrealistic but that adds to the magic of the film. Macaulay Culkin really belies his years and gives an amazing performance as Kevin McAllister, an eight year old boy left Home Alone by his family.

""Home Alone"" is a standart family comedy with naive jokes for a whole family. At the same time, this movie is deeper than just an another family comedy, therefore we like it. But let's tell everything step by step.In first, this is about humor. There are typical jokes, working by violence, but they work. Burglars are falling, taking many types of damage and show sometimes fun and sometimes strange behavior.In second, this is about Christmas. All theme of the movie goes with excellent Chistmas atmosphere: very snowy winter, sweet and comfortable home, many decorations, many firs, Church and etc. When you see the movie, you feel that kindful atmoshere and you wish for Christmas to become more and more powerful. That's why we see the movie exactly at Christmas.And, in third, this movie is about family love. Even if Kevin is annoyed and tired of his family, in depth, he loves it. He understood, what if he hadn't a family, and even helps Marley to reunite with his son and family. And there was a mother's love: she has done everything to come at Kevin.The movie is not an masterpiece in movie industry, but it is pretty good in itself niche.

403,auntbea64,One of the funniest movies of all time!,10,15 April 2001,"This is one of the funniest movies of all time!  Macaulay Culkin's facial expressions are priceless as well as timeless.  It seems that no matter how many times they are seen, they can always bring a smile to the face and laughter throughout a room.  Not to mention that he's just so dang cute! What else can one say.  This movie brings me joy when I am down.  With it's impssible antics and the 50's superhero moments with Jimmy the shop boy, who couldn't love this movie.  My only questions with the movie are how in the heck did he get the sled out the front door, and why does he always run up the stairs and in front of the camera and then turn around and go to the bedroom when he is screaming?  That bothers me and others greatly, but alas, it still does not distract from the movie.  The comedic genious that this represents is amazing, and the acting ability of Culkin rates among the childhood greats.  Well, that is enough for now.

433,rodriguez-christopher8,"Laughed out loud, great family fun!",9,10 December 2014,"In the movie ""Home Alone"" Kevin does a great job making his character likable and fun to watch, The bad guys in the movie depict not so smart villains, but create a slapstick style comedy for the whole family to enjoy. This is a great holiday movie to sit down and watch with your family. Although the movie is unrealistic, it is a movie so that's OK. The creative traps set by Kevin let the viewed think of what else they might do to protect their house against burglaries. Grab a cup of hot chocolate, popcorn, friends and family and enjoy this classic!",Home Alone

435,safelink1,Kevin is home alone,7,15 December 2014,I though home alone was good because it was funny and it was also funny how bad guys gets hurt. In felt bad for Kevin because he was home alone and his parents wasn't there. Kevin wished that he didn't have any family but at the end his family came back home and Kevin was happy when they came back. I thought home alone was cool and kind of funny. When Kevin was home alone he had ideas to how to stop the bad guys from getting in his house. Kevin learned how to do his own laundry and how to cook by him self. Kevin went to church to watch people sing. I recommend to watch this with your family. It was funny. You should watch home alone because it is funny. In the movie home alone I didn't like when Kevin was home by him self because I felt bad for Kevin when he was home by him self. My opinion would be I thought the home alone was funny and I thought it was awesome.,Home Alone

Are you yearning to go back to those childhood days when existence of life was never given as an afterthought.When the present was flamboyant with petty quarrels with our siblings, the cherubic smile on our faces when we did the so called ""mischief's"". Time to relax with those memories and be on the hangover of the little mischief's of childhood. Well the eight year old Kevin of ""home alone"" sways you away with his naughty acting.Though the plot is unbelievable the hilarious acting of the burglars holds our attention.The mischievous trap set by Kevin to teach the burglars a lesson is fascinating. The American Christmas comedy film is simply worth watching Watch out home alone. Its time for me to watch out the rest of the series...",Home Alone

441,strebycw,Theme,8,21 December 2015,"A great 4 out of 5 star movie, the 1990 classic Christmas movie called Home Alone. Overall, it's a great movie to watch with the family every Christmas.The reason I rate this movie a 4 out of 5 is because the movie keeps you on your feet towards the end and it also shows life lessons that you have to go through later in life (probably not the part where you have to defend yourself from the wet bandits). This movie shows how it feels being home alone for a couple of days. It's fun at first, but then some of us begin to miss the family. It shows that you need to be brave and be responsible which, Kevin shows a lot of it in this movie. Kevin didn't get along with his parents or siblings in the beginning of the movie. All the other kids there always made fun of him and picked on him. Kevin didn't get his cheese pizza because his brother Buzz took it, and that's the only kind of pizza Kevin ate. Kevin got angry and hit the other kid and got in trouble and, his punishment was being locked into the attic for the night. The next morning the family woke up late to go to their plane because they were leaving for vacation. They hurried and got into their taxi forgetting Kevin in the attic as he was still sleeping. Kevin woke up wishing his family wasn't there from the previous day and came to see he was home alone. Kevin was so happy that his family wasn't there he was jumping on the bed eating all the junk food he had making the place a mess. I like where Kevin had a huge fear of the wood burner as it opened and closed, thinking it was a monster. But as Kevin was home alone he had to face his fears and later in the movie he was no longer scared. My favorite part in the movie is when he has to defend his house from being robbed from the ""wet bandits"". He has to set up a bunch of booby traps and make sure his house doesn't get robbed. The only thing that strikes me is that these two men, otherwise known as the ""wet bandits"" run into these traps that Kevin lays out throughout the house. If any ordinary person was to run into these traps like they did, they would be pretty severely hurt. It is a children's movie and it is entertaining. The mother realizes that they left Kevin behind as they are already on the plane leaving and she goes through many obstacles to make sure she gets back to Kevin. After two days of Kevin being home alone his family finally comes back. Now Kevin feels a part of the family and they actually all missed him and gave him hugs. I believe the theme of this movie is that no matter what your family is important. You may go through rough patches, but they raised you and there all you got in the long run. This movie shows bravery, responsibility, and really shows that family is important. This movie is great and should be watched 10 years from now, and it's a great classic and reminds me how close this movie brought me and my family too.",Home Alone

444,josephinehaver,See first paragraph review,8,24 September 2017,"'Home Alone' is about a boy, living in a big house together with quite a view family. It's almost Christmas and the family is preparing to go on a holiday to France! Everyone is busy picking his clothes. The next morning they are leaving to go to the airport. In all hustle and bustle, they forgot Kevin. He's home alone now... Two thieves are making plans to break into the house, where Kevin is still spending his holiday. Is Kevin too clever for the two thieves?This film is absolutely my all-time favorite Christmas story. The main characters and places were chosen well and everything is fitting great. There are very much funny moments in the film and the pace is perfect, nor too fast neither too slow. I watch this movie every year with Christmas and I'm still not losing my focus while watching it. The film creates a nice Christmas feeling. Maybe it's not the best plot, but it's hilarious and I recommend you to watch it with the whole family.Compared to the other 'Home Alone' films, I think part one and two are the best. After part two the cast changed and that made it for me less well.",Home Alone
445,roketmitch,Losing Faith in the Rating System,10,14 June 2006,"6.3/10? I mean what do we have to watch these days to give a movie a flying color grade. Home Alone is one of those few movies that can be enjoyed by all! By all! Men, Women, and Children can sit together any day of the year and enjoy a heart-warming film. No, it's not the GodFather, Ben-Hur, or The Ten Commandments, but it is Sixteen Candles, A Christmas Story, and It's a Wonderful Life! The Casting is excellent, the screenplay is tremendous, and the overall effect and lore surrounding the film is luminous. There is a reason this movie still is one of the highest grossing of all time. I know that we as critics on IMDb strive for the best in motion pictures. But to those out there who are grading Home Alone with 5 or less. C'mon! We're not talking about Home Alone 3 here, but instead the timeless original!",Home Alone

447,rflair-1,8 year old kid saves the day at Christmas time!,8,28 December 2005,"This is recognised primarily as a children's film for children to enjoy at Christmas. However i beg to differ, mainly due to the fantastic on screen chemistry between Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern playing the hilarious inept burglars. okay, so the plot is ridiculous, but the comedy and action are fantastic! This film made a star out of Macauly Culkin (playing Kevin), but the real stars on show are Pesci and Stern. This film never fails to make me laugh irrespective of what month of the year i watch it. This is a great film to watch if you want to be cheered up, and don't forget the all important message of Christmas being a time for families.",Home Alone
