0,Leofwine_draca,Needless,5,2 October 2021,"Not a bad adaptation of the Roald Dahl book, but when the Nic Roeg film exists then this one doesn't need to. The setting is swapped to America, worse luck, and things feel different for the first third. Once we move to the hotel, however, this becomes a lesser, almost shot-for-shot reprise of the Roeg movie but of a much lesser quality; the only notable thing is that the original book ending is kept. The kids are okay here, the CGI is average, but the adult actors fail to give convincing performances, and Anne Hathaway in particular is hammily horrible.",The Witches
1,SnoopyStyle,no good reason,4,26 October 2020,"In 1968, a young Hero Boy is forced to go live with his grandma (Octavia Spencer) after losing his parents in a car accident. She tells him that witches are real and they hate children. As a child, she lost her friend when a witch turned her into a chicken. She gives him a white mouse. She takes him to a seaside hotel for an escape hoping that witches would not search there since black children are rarely at the luxury hotel. Unfortunately, the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) has gathered her followers to present a potion to turn all children into mice.This is the second film adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book. The 1990 adaptation stars Anjelica Huston and is a fan favorite. It's probably a fool's errand to try to do another. The only reason is to upgrade the mice with CGI and that's often a bad idea. The charm of the old animatronics is actually more timeless than CGI which ages over time. It does inject some American racial divide into the story but the movie drops that interesting take rather quickly. The one awful thing it does is to replace the greatness of Huston with a terribly weird Joker-smiling Hathaway. It is bad. There is no good reason for this movie and watching it proves that.",The Witches
2,Prismark10,The Witches,5,9 November 2020,"Robert Zemeckis with the help of Guillermo del Toro has gone for a grotesque take on Roald Dahl's The Witches.The book has been transplanted to Alabama 1968. A young boy (Jahzir Bruno) goes to live with his Grandma (Octavia Spencer) after the death of his parents in a car accident. He gets a pet mouse to cheer him up.One day in a store he is lured by a witch who offers him a bar of chocolate. However his grandma calls out for him before any damage is done.His grandmother tells him when she was a child her friend was turned into a chicken by a witch. The witches seem to target black kids as no one seems to notice when they go missing.The boy is taken to a hotel to stay by the seaside by his grandmother. Unfortunately the witches are having a convention where the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) plans to turn all the children into mice.Blessed with a narration from Chris Rock, a camp performance from Anne Hathaway and expensive CGI special effects. This adaptation still struggles compared to Nicolas Roeg's version from 1990.This can be shown by the waste of Stanley Tucci's hotel manager character. At times The Witches wants to be a dark Disneyfied kids movie with a nod and a wink to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. This explains why a fat boy lured with bars of chocolate is transformed into a mouse because of his greed.",The Witches
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Remake Absolutely Unnecessary, But Also Funny",7,29 March 2021,"The timeless Nicolas Roeg's ""The Witches"" (1990) is one of the most delightful movies from the 90's. Great performance, with Anjelica Huston fantastic and great make-up and special effects that have not aged after more than thirty years.""The Witches (2020)"" by Robert Zemeckis is a remake absolutely unnecessary, with the same story and modernizations (Afro-American lead actor and grandmother, state-of-art special effects etc.). However, the book by Roald Dahl is great and this film is fail-proof for children and adults. Consequently it is also funny. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Convenção das Bruxas"" (""Witches Convention"")",The Witches

I can see kids liking it.",The Witches
5,kosmasp,Magic,7,12 July 2021,"If you've seen the original, you probably do not need to see this. I had no idea this was a remake when I watched this. But I had a strong feeling of Deja Vu. I was quite glad I had seen the original. Overall the first movie to go a certain place is better than a remake. Rule of the thumb or however the saying goes.This still can be a lot of fun. Yes it is CGI heavy, yes it isn't the best CGI ever and all that. But it can be fun to watch. Unless you are a witch and feel this is misrepresenting your way of life ... ok kidding aside (I hope that is a joke you say? Yes me too), some things may be considered offensive, but you could say similar things about the original too.A fun family film with some shockers in between - maybe not for the very small ones then.",The Witches
6,Sleepin_Dragon,Please make these awful remakes stop.,3,9 November 2020,"Oh Dear,This should have been good, it needed to be good, sadly it just isn't. It's one of those films where a remake didn't seem to be necessary, but as someone that loved Roald Dahl as a child my interest was peaked.It's inconsistent throughout, did they perhaps rush it because of Covid? The special effects look decent in parts, and woeful in others, Anne Hathaway displays personality it's fair to say, but her accent..... If anyone remembers Rentaghost, think Miss Popov, she spans countries from Ireland to Russia, it had me chuckling.Once again, please, please try and give us something new and original, stop taking things that have already been made, and making them ten times worse. An extra point for casting the wonderful Josette Simon.It made me want to watch Anjelica Huston.I paid to download it, that money could have gone on something less awful, like a Donny Osmond cd.Naff, 3/10.",The Witches
7,classicsoncall,"""That's some serious ratification!""",6,8 October 2021,"I've recently been watching Roald Dahl's ""Tales of the Unexpected"" and thought this would be along similar lines, but it turned out to be more a movie for kids. I even turned to my wife as the witch coven began blowing up and turning into rodents stating, can you believe we're watching this? This while our twelve year old granddaughter sits on a laptop with her Roblox; I would have had her watch this with us to get her take on it. The picture is mildly entertaining, though I will say the direction given Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch left a lot to be desired. She was just too irritating, although that was probably the point. Now that you've got my mild warning, I'd advise you to haul a couple of kids into the room to watch this with you, as it would probably make the experience more enjoyable. I did like the comforting advice offered by Octavia Spencer's character, the old Grandma in the story, when near the end she stated to her three little mice - ""Never give up what you are inside"". But I don't know if it was a good idea to leave her grandson and friends as tiny rodents. What kind of message is that?",The Witches
8,lee_eisenberg,it was what I expected,5,31 October 2020,"I knew that there was no way that Robert Zemeckis's version of Roald Dahl's book would equal Nicolas Roeg's version. The setting in 1960s Alabama should've made for a broader focus on racial issues.Nevertheless, you gotta love Anne Hathaway's performance as the Grand High Witch, talking like Natasha on ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"".Basically, if you expect nonstop silliness from this version of ""The Witches"", you won't be disappointed. I do hope that Zemeckis's next movie is something more along the lines of his first movies, though.",The Witches
9,paul_haakonsen,A bewitching adventure for the entire family...,6,26 October 2020,"Granted, I can't remember the original 1990 movie, so I can't really compare this 2020 version from director Robert Zemeckis to the 1990 version from Nicolas Roeg.Sure, one might debate whether or not the 1990 movie needed to be remade or revisited. Sure, I don't recall that movie, but I am generally not one that is pro-remakes of movies.Regardless, I will say that the 2020 version of ""The Witches"" definitely was a movie that was enjoyable for the entire family. And there was enough varied contents to the movie to ensure that most people in the audience would be entertained. I know I was.Visually then ""The Witches"" was quite good, which was to be expected for such an endeavor. And the special effects and CGI team definitely helped carry the movie quite the distance. I liked what they did to present the witches as being non-human creatures.The cast in the movie was good, and with the likes of Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway, to mention the most notably of performers, then you definitely were in good company throughout the course of this movie.However, to me at least, ""The Witches"" is hardly a movie that warrants more than a single viewing. While the movie was enjoyable and entertaining, the storyline just didn't have enough contents to be seen more than once, unlike many other movies.My rating of ""The Witches"" settles on a six out of ten stars.",The Witches
10,view_and_review,As Good as the 1990 Version,7,25 October 2020,"""The Witches"" is a remake of the movie of the same name made in 1990, both of which are adaptations of the Roald Dahl book of the same title.I like the 2020 version of ""The Witches."" It improved upon the visual effects used in the 1990 movie even though it didn't improve much upon the script.This time around the movie takes place in 1968 Alabama. The little boy who lost his parents was played by Jahzir Bruno and his grandmother was played by Octavia Spencer. The Grand High Witch was played by Anne Hathaway. She did as well as Anjelica Huston did in 1990, though she was scarier and more sinister looking due to the CGI and her displays of brute strength.The performances were all good, and the changes from the 1990 version to the 2020 version were slight with the exception of the ending. I think they made a good decision by releasing it on HBO. It's a decent movie, but nothing to rush out to theaters to see.",The Witches
11,ops-52535,a nice film...,8,27 October 2020,"For the rest of us that thankfully hasnt seen ''the original'', and that havent read that roald dahl novel. and by most of all, its a childrens movie, with , at times highflyin cruelty and devilishness that might scare the smallest ones, its well balanced and made me the grumpy old man laugh out loud several times.with anne hathaway and octavia spencer head to head as the good and evil vice versa, does a magnificent job at these sets. how the producers has been able to sneak in all that witch-symbology are just ravishingly well doneproductionwise its a gallore of flashing lights and colour, the plot speed are extremely high, and the special effects duely done. so if i should pick a movie for my grandchildren of the future, this one will surtainly one that i could wrap miself up in the couch with them kids in ,cuddling the sofa pillows to protect us from the evil, and devour the fun.so its a recommend from the grumpy old man",The Witches
12,Thanos_Alfie,Nice family movie...,6,27 April 2021,"""The Witches"" is an Adventure - Family movie in which we watch a young boy with his grandmother trying to save themselves from some witches and their leader. The witches have a scary plan that if they succeed it, it will change the world for ever.I found this movie interesting and since I have not read the book I can say that it was entertaining. The direction which was made by Robert Zemeckis, it was very good and he presented very well his main characters along with the plot of the movie, something that made us relate to his main characters. The interpretation of Octavia Spencer who played as Grandma, it was very good and I believe that her character fitted very well to her. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Anne Hathaway's who played as Grand High Witch and Jahzir Bruno's who played as Hero Boy. The narration of Chris Rock was spectacular and gave a nice touch on the movie. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Witches"" is a nice family movie to watch and I am sure that you will have a great time watching it.",The Witches
13,cruise01,The Witches tries to be a fun horror family thriller but is lot with a thin plot and cheesy cgi.,6,2 December 2020,3 out of 5 stars.The Witches is a fantasy thriller about a young boy who lives with his grandmother. Only to learn from her that witches exist. And they hate children. When the boy comes across a witch. Grandmother decides to take boy out on a getaway at a resort. Which conveniently a group of witches are hosting a convention. Led by Anne Hathaway. The boy and another gets captured and turned into a mouse. Which they try to stop the witches.Cute and fun film for the family. But cheesy cgi and visual effects makes the movie feel cheapily put together. The acting was also decent with the cast ensemble. The story also comes out short with barely anything to mention.,The Witches
14,Tweetienator,Lifeless & Loveless,3,6 January 2021,"I really tried to like this remake but it is simply inferior in every aspect to the original one from 1990, I would even say that the material is very life- and loveless produced and just spiced up and good looking due some good work from the special effects department.

15,matthewssilverhammer,Not bad,6,18 November 2020,"I didn't grow up with the book, nor did I see the 1990 film until very recently, so I have no nostalgic affinity for this story. Keep that in mind when I say this: I actually kinda dug this. Everything about Hathaway rules: the giant performance, creepy design, dramatic arrogance. Yes, the other performances are oddly lackadaisical, & Zemeckis desperately needs someone to stop him from his unending use of unconvincing CGI. Otherwise, this is a bold, old-fashioned, decidedly un-family-friendly family yarn.",The Witches

18,lisafordeay,Not as scary as the 1990 one but still enjoyable,7,22 October 2020,"The Witches 2020 is a remake of the 1990 film with Angelica Huston and is loosely based on the Roald Dahl novel. This time we have an African American boy living with his grandmother in 1960s Alabama and they travel to the Grand Hotel where we meet the grand high witch(Anne Hathaway) who is sporting a joker style mouth instead of wearing a mask in this version and she holds a meeting where every child will transform into a mouse. So will the boy and his 2 new friends save the day.
Overall its not as scary as the 1990 version as that scared the living daylight out of me. Anne Hathaway did her own version of Angelica Huston's charcther and I liked how it wasn't a copy and paste of the original.(like The Lion King which came out last year and that had NO changes).If you are looking for a creepy film watch the 1990 one instead,if you found that one too scary,go watch the 2020 one instead. I know there will be alot of people on here saying this wasn't the witches,but you can't please everyone.",The Witches

20,GiraffeDoor,If you think the poster doesn't LOOK dangerous...,7,13 April 2021,"I have a special relationship with the book and the first movie.But two decades later I am not as rattled as I was and I can now see the book as the half-thought through children's story it really was with a few cool ideas, though I still sort of like it.I am very cynical about remakes of good movies, including re-interpretations of a base source, but I wanted to give this every chance because it might be a chance to see a different take.And I was not disappointed in that respect. Not only was the ethnic character of the main characters changed (which really gave the film a whole new vibe) I can tell that they carefully omit some of the choice scenes that were done so well in the other movie and work on giving us some new concepts to work with all built around the familiar narrative so old fans and newcomers alike can enjoy this.The grandmother is a very different character than to what we're used to and that helped a lot. The coincidence that she just happens to be a Witch expert is dealt with nicely.If you're not familiar with the narrative at all I would not discourage you from making your first experience with it this picture. It's really a terrifying story and it lacks both the flaccid second act of the book and the campiness of the first movie.A strange fairly tale that is surreal and yet on some level feels almost too real. An ever-present but hidden danger gradually approaches and dares us to laugh at its silliness but I, personally, daren't.Sure, there is a little awkward CGI but I admire the fresh design they gave (especially to the grand high witch). I wish they'd found an actual Norwegian to play her but she is still pretty scary (Norway is for me in generally pretty scary, with the interesting exception of its rather lacklustre heavy metal).This is seriously a lot more effective than a lot of horror movies and though it does at times move into a cartoonish territory, it's a compelling tail from beginning to end.I'm tempted to say use this movie to ease a child into full horror but in practice you'd just spoil them for the horror we're getting. Yeah, I'm kind of a snob.Oh, and the girl mouse adds nothing, there I said it.",The Witches

24,jimbo-53-186511,Horrific,2,19 March 2021,"After learning that her grandson has recently come into contact with a witch (whom all hate children and consequently fearing for her grandson's safety his grandmother whisks her grandson away to a seaside hotel. However, she soon learns that, coincidentally, the witches are staying at the same hotel and they have a ghastly plan of action to eradicate every child on the planet...I have seen the original Witches film and therefore drawing comparisons between the 2 films is somewhat inevitable; for me though the 2 films are worlds apart in terms of quality with the remake clearly being the much inferior offering...The budget is clearly much bigger in this remake than the much lower budgeted original, but to me it felt as though too much effort was put in to trying to make the film look good rather than actually being good. I like CGI in films when I feel as though it is used to enhance the viewing experience, but in this film a lot of it came across as silly, pointless or show-offy (sometimes all 3 at once). Here the Grand High Witch can fly and has go-go gadget arms and all of the witches have Chelsea smiles; I thought the idea of witches in this story was for them to blend in with society yet a bunch of women all arriving together with scars on their faces is never noticed and/or arouses suspicion with the hotel manager or any of the staff or guests.I think the really big difference between the 2 films is how indifferently everything plays out in this remake; the original film built many elements of its story up with a bit of suspense and tension which made the original a far more involving experience. In the remake, it all feels rather rushed and there's no real depth to any of the characters (Bruno's parents were portrayed as being a lot more snobbish in the original which gave them a bit of character and likewise the hotel manager was developed far more in the original which meant that interactions between characters carried more weight and it meant that the original had a bit of dark humour which was severely lacking here).If we look at the acting then perhaps the only person who stands out as being better here than in the original is Octavia Spencer as the grandmother; she's just got that little bit more pep and fire about her and she was good in every scene in the film. Anne Hathaway does a good job as the grand high witch, but she can't hold a candle to Anjelica Houston (even with all the makeup and CGI). Tucci is poor as the hotel manager coming nowhere near as close to the quality that Rowan Atkinson brought to the role in the original (although Tucci isn't entirely to blame -he wasn't used as well as Atkinson was in the original).The Witches 2020 feels rather slap-dash, crass and underwritten leaving the CGI to be the star of the show (which I might have given more credit for had it not all came across as being so cartoonish). Aside from good performances from Hathaway and Spencer the film has little else going for it. In all honesty you'd be better off watching the original which while being far from perfect at least contained some tension, suspense and a far better developed narrative.",The Witches

26,kluseba,"Dynamic, entertaining and imaginative comedy for the whole family",8,25 February 2021,"Based upon a novel by Roald Dahl and a movie by Nicolas Roeg, The Witches has been harshly criticized in comparison upon release. The movie tells the story of a young boy and his grandmother who confront a congregation of witches at a fancy hotel.Personally, I have been entertained very well by this movie that mixes comedy with a few hints of adventure and horror. The characters are charismatic, diversified and intriguing. The plot has epic proportions but is nevertheless easy to follow from start to finish. The locations have been chosen with great care and are truly inspiring. The special effects are absolutely outstanding and well-integrated into the movie. The sountrack is quite diversified and underlines the different atmospheres throughout the movie skillfully. The acting performances by an eccentric Anne Hathaway and a quirky Octavia Spencer are second to none. Codie-Lei Eastick and Jahzir Bruno convince as charismatic child actors with lots of potential. The movie has a perfect running time and didn't have any noticeable lengths. Since I have enjoyed this movie as an adult, I could imagine that it might be even more exciting for a younger audience as this truly is a film for the whole family.I won't compare this movie to the novel or the original film and I can understand that the expectations of some nostalgic fans couldn't be met. However, The Witches is a dynamic, entertaining and imaginative comedy film for the whole family in my humble opinion.

29,davidmvining,A return to a more kid friendly filmmaking form,7,8 December 2020,"This feels like a return to an older style of storytelling for Robert Zemeckis. This is more in line with the manic early films of his career rather than the more maturely told movies he'd been making since the 90s. In another way, this also feels like the safest move he could have made after the financial flop that was Allied and the incredibly ill-conceived mess (as well as financial flop) that was Welcome to Marwen. A retelling of a well-regarded children's book that had another adaptation from thirty years ago is the sort of safe movie an established director makes after having cost some studios a few bundles of money.So, witches are real, and they're real ugly and they hate children. Our protagonist (I'm not calling him Hero Boy) is a young boy who lost his parents to a car crash in Chicago in the 60s and moved in with his grandmother in Alabama. She's a healer and tells him of witches and how they want to turn children into animals. When our protagonist meets a witch in the local grocery store, Grandma takes serious precautions and takes the boy to a swanky hotel on the Gulf Coast that her relation used to be the executive chef at. Coincidentally, a large coven of witches are using the hotel at the same time for a gathering in which the Grand High Witch details her master plan to put a potion in chocolate that will turn children into mice. The boy and another young English boy named Bruno get turned into mice, and the two, along with another child turned mouse that the boy had kept as a pet and the boy's grandmother, must find a way to fight the witches and turn their evil plot around.It's the exact same story as the Nicholas Roeg version from 1990 with a different ending, but, oddly enough, Zemeckis' version, which runs about fifteen minutes longer, ends up moving far more quickly with a focus on visceral movement and action over brooding menace. I enjoy the Roeg version, but this one is definitely a different beast despite the same story, and I find Zemeckis' return to spectacle based storytelling to be a fun diversion.Performed with a very odd Swedish/Norwegian accent by Anne Hathaway, the Grand High Witch is a scenery chewing monster without any subtlety, and as an antagonist in a children's fantasy adventure tale, I found her amusing. Octavia Spencer plays the Grandmother with tenderness and strictness in equal measure, providing a very nice human grounding for the second half of the film after the boy gets turned into a mouse.The special effects use CGI rather extensively, even going so far as to animate a cat that's never more than a cat, and I get the feeling that the decision to move the release from theaters to HBO Max might have cut back on the budget to finalize the movie a bit. The computer generated animals never look bad, mind you, but they exist between cartoonish and real in an uncomfortable spot. They're just a bit too cartoonish to feel like they exist in the same space as the humans around them. Another few million and a couple more passes in post-production might have made that gel a bit better, but as it stands, in a children's fantasy adventure film, I found it largely serviceable. As an end note, I did find Alan Silvestri's score to be an odd companion to the action on screen as he pulled rather heavily from his work on The Avengers movies, delivering a bombastic and bass heavy score in place of something to probably should have been lighter and more whimsical like he did on Back to the Future.Energetic, well-performed, and appealing, Robert Zemeckis' apology for losing so much money on his last two movies is a fun diversion of a family film with a menacing villain and a winning performance by Octavia Spencer.",The Witches
30,jadepietro,Strange Magic,5,7 December 2020,"IN BRIEF: All of the joy and wicked dark humor has been zapped from Roald Dahl's classic novel in this over-produced nightmare.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) This garish retelling of the Roald Dahl's charmingly macabre children's novel is a major disappointment, especially from the talented director Robert Zemeckis. Lately, he has been so enamored with CGI and its powerful effects that he sacrifices his actors and story to wow his audience. This moviegoer was not.All of Mr. Dahl's dark humor and subtle wit has been expunged by the director and his writing crew (Kenya Barris, Guillermo del Toro and Mr. Zemeckis himself) as they readapt the hi-jinks to a Black family in Southern Alabama during the late sixties. The move does not go well.Octavia Spencer plays Grandma and she, at least, brings some sense of humor to her character. Jahzir Kadeem Bruno plays Hero Boy (?) and he is serviceable in his role as written. As they encounter a group of witches at a hotel convention, the stage is set for humor and conflict that rarely materializes.Most of the fault belongs with the director and script, but Anne Hathaway's bizarre interpretation of the Grand High Witch is all terror and none of the fun. Her thick German accent is sometimes unintelligible, and the CGI only distorts and makes the character more repellent and unpleasant than needed. Granted, she's a witch, but far from bewitching. The comedy is sorely missing in this performance. It's as if someone put a spell on this actress' skills as a comedian which she has shown to better effect in many other movies. Also wasted in his role as the harried hotel manager is the usually reliable Stanley Tucci.There is no delight or whimsy in this off-kilter film adaptation for today's audience, only lots of desperation and some spiffy CGI, certainly too intense for younger audiences...and this reviewer.

There is incredible talent behind this production: Roald Dahl - book; Robert Zemeckis - director; Guillermo Del Torro - producer; Olivia Spencer, Anne Hathaway, Stanley Tucci - actors; voice talent of Chris Rock and Kristin Chenoweth. My only caution is that I'm a little afraid it may be too terrifying for children (but, the only experience I have of children is being one, who never really grew up). I give this film a solid 7 (really good) out of 10. {Live Action with Animation, Adventure}",The Witches

The cast is excellent, especially Hathaway and Spencer.

The C.G.I could be cleaned up and the movie might have legs as a childrens movie. This will not happen as however bad a movie is the audiances opinion never counts. This might change as their is a growing number of flops because they have these idiotic agendas that spoil movies and try to fix week plots with over reliance on special effects. Theres been complaints about the hands and I think the mouth looks stupid. why this movie never got fixed in post production shows that no one with any sense, has the finnal say before release.",The Witches
37,Sir_AmirSyarif,Anne Hathaway conjures frights in familiar yet entertaining movie,6,25 October 2020,"Anne Hathaway, who is clearly having a blast as the Grand High Witch, conjures frights in familiar yet entertaining 'Roald Dahl's The Witches.' Robert Zemeckis' take stays close to the book with only a few minor changes here and there. It's fine but it lacks the charm and fun that the Nicolas Roeg's movie had.",The Witches
38,killercharm,modern witchery,10,14 March 2021,"Set in Alabama, this retelling of Roald Dahl's story is magically millennial. Anne Hathaway can throw down with the monster mouth. Much like the original film version of this story the cast is a glove fit. Each actor a tower of power. There are a couple few scenes recreated virtually shot-for-shot from the 1990 movie. Then there are scenes that are faithful to the book when the first was not. It's like one big happy family. In this jewel of a story a little boy and his grandma go to a resort hotel for vacay. Lo and behold! The witches of the US are having a convention at that very hotel.",The Witches
39,kjproulx,A Pointless Copy and Paste (Zemeckis is Way Better than This),3,23 October 2020,"I'm not sure where to begin on this one, so let's wind the clocks back to 1990 and talk about the original film based on the same book. While I haven't read the Roald Dahl classic book of the same name, I enjoyed the creativity throughout the first adaptation of his work. The Witches from 1990 had many issues and stretched out a very small story to fill the run time of a feature film, which was absolutely the most notable negative of that film for me, as it was for this 2020 version as well. At a mere 105 minutes, Robert Zemeckis' The Witches felt like an eternity to sit through and missed the mark almost entirely for me.This film begins with a montage of images that showcase the fact that witches exist in this world. After the death of his parents, a young boy and his grandma flea to an expensive hotel, where they can get away from the witches, whom they believe are following them. Without knowing it, they end up going to this hotel during some form of witch conference. This in turn leads to this young boy being turned into a mouse by them, as well as another young boy at the hotel. The two of them, along with another mouse, venture around the hotel, trying to escape from these witches.The premise itself is the most intriguing part, as it's equally strange and fun. With that said, the idea was created as a book, then as a mediocre film in 1990, and now remake nearly exactly the same in every way. Because it did nothing new with the material, I have nothing but criticism honestly, aside from one major thing that I really appreciated. Without ruining it, the original film ends in a way that left me disappointed, but this remake actually had the guts to do something that I wished the original had done. For that reason, I give this film a little praise, but that's just how the film ends because the rest is absolutely the same.I admit that I was enjoying the first act of this film because Octavia Spencer made for a very enjoyable grandmother to this young boy and I would've loved more of that. Sadly, once they get to the hotel, the movie takes no chances and the witches themselves chew up the scenery, and not in a good way. Anne Hathway plays the head witch and although she's absolutely committed to the role and having a blast, I just found her performance to be way too overdone. I commend her for going all out, but it didn't work for me. This was a major issue because she has more than half of the screentime of the duration of the movie.In the end, Robert Zemeckis is a director that I love, but his latest efforts in Allied, Welcome to Marwen, and now The Witches have all been less than stellar to say the least. I thought The Walk and Flight were great films, but I haven't truly loved one of his films since Cast Away, which was 20 years ago. On top of that, Zemeckis also wrote the screenplay with both Kenya Barris and Guillermo del Toro, so I'm really not sure how all those creative brains just made a copy and paste of the original. There was so much talent behind the lens here and I'm still scratching my head as to how this was the final result. I don't believe this film is worth anyone's time, but it's now available through HBO if you wish.",The Witches
40,tm-sheehan,I couldn't watch it all . Anne Hathaway bombs,1,11 September 2021,"My Review- The Witches
My Rating. 1/10I had to stop watching this version of Roald Dahl's classic story.I really liked the 1990 film version starring Angelica Huston so why oh why did they have to remake this movie or should I say
unmake it and ruin the fun and intelligence of the Original.Anne Hathaway an actress I usually admire is miscast in my opinion as The Grand High Witch and unfortunately was the main reason I disliked what I saw of the movie.She lacks any subtlety in this role plays it high camp with the most shrill and fake accent I've heard in a film in years.Her performance relies heavily on the hideous make up and special effects .Is Miss Hathaway going through a career dip ? Judging from her last movie ""Locked Down"" which I also thought was a lukewarm and shrill performance I suspect she is.I hope she can bounce back to her usual quality performances and choose better roles in her movie and Television projects..
Perhaps it was the Director and Scriptwriter Robert Zemeckis fault , he has directed some great movies but this one bombs for me.It's probably unfair of me to judge on less than an hour but I just couldn't watch any more.",The Witches
41,legobuilderpro,Witch,5,24 October 2020,I liked octavia spencer in the movie as the grandma and Ann hathaway was creepy as the main witch with scary effects.It might not be better than the old movie but it is about as good in the creepy factor as in the original,The Witches
42,jp_91,Not that bad!,6,11 November 2020,"I'm a big fan of the original film, ""The Witches"" (2020) is a weak film, the first half is good but then the second half is slow.

43,raybennetthays,Why do people hate this so much?,7,10 March 2021,"I don't get it, I thought this movie was good, every actor was committed to their performance, I wasn't even at my house when I watched this for the first time, I was at a friend's house, and I tell you, I like this movie. The cgi is terrifying, and octavia spencer gives so much to this movie. So go watch this movie if you've never seen it, you won't be disappointed",The Witches
44,MrDHWong,A mediocre update to a beloved children's story that only barely manages to engage its audience,6,5 November 2020,"""The Witches"" is a dark fantasy film based on the novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future Trilogy, Forrest Gump) and starring Anne Hathaway, it is a mediocre update to a beloved children's story that only barely manages to engage its audience.In 1968 in Alabama, the unnamed hero boy (Jahzir Kadeem Bruno) survives a car crash that kills both of his parents and is sent to live with his maternal grandmother (Octavia Spencer). One day when the two are out shopping together, the hero boy encounters a witch who entices him with a snake and some chocolate, but disappears when his grandmother calls out to him. Later on, the grandmother tells the hero boy about how witches are very real and that once they set their sights on a particular child, they will never give up pursuit until that child is dead. Desperate to avoid her grandson from being killed, the grandmother and the hero boy take refuge in a high class hotel, unaware that a large group of witches led by the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) are staying there as well.Nearly everyone I have met has read at least one story written by Roald Dahl. His dark sense of humour and tongue-in-cheek wit still resonates strongly with many people today, and most of this ends up being translated successfully into cinematic form with films like 1990's ""The Witches"". That film remains one of the most popular adaptations of Dahl's work, so it comes as a surprise that this modern update with seemingly better technology thirty years later could be so inferior in comparison. What I believe made the 1990 film special was how lively and raw the special effects were thanks to the puppetry and animatronics provided by the The Jim Henson Company. Whenever you saw a character interact with a mouse or a freakishly ugly witch, you instantly got the feeling that there was something physically there in front of them. With this film, the CGI is so overabundant and unconvincing that it severed most connection with me as I watched actors talk to an obvious green screen under the pretense that something will be added later in post-production. This made the film feel soulless and sterile and it constantly made me wish I was watching the original film instead.Quite a few talented people worked on this film, like director Robert Zemeckis, who also co-wrote the script with Guillermo del Toro. This should have been a winning combination but instead it seems nothing good came from it. Not once did I ever have that sense of wonder and fascination I've come to expect from watching a movie made with the involvement of either of these two. Zemeckis, who directed the cult classic ""Death Becomes Her"", a film renowned for its impressive visual effects, instead takes the easy route of overloading each scene with CGI and badly rendered animals, including a very fake looking cat. Additionally, del Toro's signature style seems like a mixed bag here, keeping that dark fantasy tone while also including scenes that would be too frightening for most young children. That's not to say the 1990 film didn't have its fair share of scary moments, but most of them were brief, whereas this time the camera would often linger on the fearsome appearances of the witches enough to burn their images into one's mind. Something like this may be fine for del Toro's other films aimed at adults but seeing as this is supposed to be for kids it comes across as unnecessarily mean-spirited.The film's one saving grace was Anne Hathaway's performance as the Grand High Witch. Almost equalling Anjelica Huston before her, Hathaway brings so much over-the-top madness and eccentricism to her role that one can't help but laugh at seeing her lose herself playing this cartoonishly evil character. She easily overshadows the rest of the cast, which isn't really a good thing the more I think about it. While all of the other actors aren't terrible by any means, they just didn't leave as much of an impression as their 1990 film counterparts. Rather strangely, the film is narrated by Chris Rock as the older hero boy, which made the film feel as though I was watching an episode of the sitcom ""Everybody Hates Chris"". Even though that did offer some mild amusement, it still seemed like a bizarre creative decision that made me forget I was supposed to be watching a Roald Dahl story in the first place.In the end, I just don't see this film being anywhere near as fondly remembered as the 1990 one. The very fact that I am able to recall so much of the original off the top of my head despite having seen it so long ago whereas with this one I am struggling to think of even one memorable scene goes to show which of the two has the most staying power. Roald Dahl rather infamously hated nearly all film adaptations of his work so it's hard to say if he'd approve of this one, but considering that it does accurately follow certain parts of the book more closely than its previous incarnation makes me think he would probably enjoy this one more. Personally, I'm going to stick with the 1990 film and so should you.I rate it 5.5/10",The Witches
45,meydiana-65242,What The Heck Was This? Little Stuart 1&2 is more good than this!,1,27 February 2021,"Honestly, I'm not sure why they made this remake--it's horrible!This is nowhere near as good as the first. This is such a hollow, zero substance remake. In fact, it was so annoying to watch. I like Anne Hathaway but she did not do justice to this role. It's so over the top and came off more annoying than scary. Angelica Huston was so perfect in her portrayal that she didn't even need to speak and you'd get the chills from her stare. I think everything was just overly done but without any substance. Even the weaving choreography-like movements as the witches entered the grand room they were having their meeting was annoying! The other witches in this movie also seem like they were just there to fill the bodies of witches--even they didn't add any kind of color to the movie. Plus, let's not even talk about the ending...oi! I was so excited for this and even set a reminder, way ahead in advance. This is such a major disappointment.",The Witches
46,Alexander_Blanchett,Anne Hathaway as female Venom,5,31 October 2020,"Well this goes down as one of the most useless remakes of the last years. I am not sure why a creative mind like Robert Zemeckis wasted his time on a project like this. I know he is often hit and miss but lately more miss than hit.
The original film starring Anjelica Huston gives us a much deeper insight of the story and is not as superficial as this one. It is funny and sad in a way and has a much better ending ( not sure what the ending in the book is, but this one was really unsatisfying).
Anne Hathaway is really bad. She really overdid it and overacts her role to death. And while I generally really enjoyed the effects and male up work in this film (one of the better aspects) why did she look like a female Venom? Octavia Spencer tried her best and she did have some fine moments but was just too cute and nice for he own good at times. But still one of the better aspects of the film. Stanley Tucci was painfully wasted. He tried to give his character a bit irk but yeah, was mostly forgettable. The score was ok, the look was fine but thats about it.
A huge disappointment regarding the enormous talent that was involved with it.",The Witches
47,chunkylefunga,Remember when Zemeckis used to be good?,4,2 November 2020,I mean just what happened here.You've got a classic book and a decent adaptation in the 90s and yet someone Zemeckis managed to balls up a movie that should have been easy to bring into the 21st century.Such a missed opportunity.,The Witches
48,cardsrock,Bafflingly weird,4,30 October 2020,"This is a movie that's bizarre and not in a good way. The Witches look pretty horrifying and not in a spooky manner. The animation as a whole is very poor for the year 2020 and is distracting throughout. The fact 3 Oscar-winning directors were heavily involved in the making of this film is stunning. The effort here is lackluster, except for Hathaway, who you can tell is enjoying chewing the scenery. Zemeckis keeps doing these weird hybrid animation movies that just aren't good. A lot of the visuals are disturbing and the messages aren't well told. Also the Everybody Hates Chris narration is super weird. Not sure who asked for this movie, but it wasn't me.",The Witches
49,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,6 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...Another movie version of Roald Dahl's, ""The Witches"", for a new generation. Having watched (and being a fan of) the 1990 film based on the same story, I admit I went into this one a bit more critical than most films. This 2020 version did deliver in certain areas, but failed in others.After our young hero boy's parents are killed in a car accident, he goes to live with his grandmother, who seems to know quite a bit about witches. To escape the gaze of a witch that approaches the boy in a hardware store, she takes him on a small vacation to a nearby hotel. However, unknown to them both, a convention of witches is being held in the hotel, headed by the Grand High Witch herself. When the boy is discovered and turned into a mouse, the race is on to find his grandmother, and stop the witches' dastardly plan to turn every child in the world into a mouse.As I mentioned at the outset, I have seen and loved the Anjelica Huston 1990 version of this classic tale, so I did a little comparison. One of the things I did not like was the fact that our witches were dumbed down. There wasn't nearly as much engagement with the coven of witches, and Hathaway's version of the Grand High Witch pales in comparison to Huston's performance. However, I liked what Octavia Spencer brought to the role as the grandmother, and the special effects were very good.This really wasn't a bad film, but I cannot recommend it. The magic just wasn't there in this re-make. It is fun, entertaining, and made me smile in places. But, for a better telling of this story, I personally would recommend you watch 1990's film instead. It has it all. This was ""just okay"" at 6 stars out of 10.",The Witches
50,rdoubleoc,"Not as good as the original, but pretty good.",9,23 October 2020,"You can definitely tell the movie was done by Zemeckis, just by the amount of special effects (the figures in the rain on the window, etc., etc.). I didn't see anything in this movie that I haven't really seen before, though, which I was kind of disappointed in (usually Zemeckis does something new in his movies, but maybe I missed what it was).That being said, this is definitely the best movie and content to be released this month, and that's all I'm going to say, since it seems unfair to harshly judge a movie when there's nothing else to compare it to (at least not on this level -- there's tons of cheap movies coming out still, but nothing that matches the quality of this movie).Cast was great.Music/soundtrack seemed to be missing somewhat, or at least lacking, however (usually Zemeckis has a lot more high quality sound and music, like Back to the Future, and WFRR).I also feel like the movie might have benefitted from more traditional special effects, but I always feel that way about every movie.All in all, pretty good, though.",The Witches
51,elicopperman,It is What it is,5,31 October 2020,"Now if you're going to go into this movie expecting anything similar to the first adaptation, you'll be sorely disappointed. Yes, people seem to remember it more than the original book, but just like the case of Willy Wonka vs Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, it's a misunderstood case of not realizing what one adaptation is over the other. I can't stress enough how much this irritates me. I'm not saying this film is all that great though, as it has as many misfires as it does gems. For all the decent performances, impressive practical effects and playful cinematography, there's also a sordid first half of the narrative, bland characters and horrifying CGI. My only recommendation is to see this if you've never read the book or seen the 1990 adaptation, because it's more for first time viewers anyway.",The Witches
52,paulwattriley,CGI is awful and overused,4,1 November 2020,Sorry but CGI is mostly awful it works for some things but when a 20 movie done 20 years ago looks more authentic and realistic you know there is a problem. Costume and make up much more effective than CGI so lets get back to the basics. It appears that movie makers think that CGI will make a movie good when infact its the exact opposite.,The Witches

54,p-jonsson,Quite decent family movie.,7,5 April 2021,"Unlike what a lot of people seems to think about this movie I though it was a fairly decent family movie. It's not great but decent enough. I quite enjoyed it at least.The story is what it is. It is a Roald Dahl story so it is somewhat dark but funny and with some light at the same time. Of course there are a bunch of whiners complaining that it is too dark and not suited for children. Well, everyone knows (or should now) what to expect from a Roald Dahl story so just go and see another movie then. My kids, even when they where younger, would have no problem with this movie. But then I would spend the time to watch it with them. It is called parenting.The beginning felt a wee bit slow perhaps but once the grand witch, and in particular the three mice, entered the scene it became rather funny.The one thing I did not like that much was the over the top silly acting of the witches, especially the grand witch. They could really have toned down that it bit to make her a bit more scary. Now she just became silly and somewhat annoying.The special effects were quite nice. The mice was a bit cartoonish but that was okay for this movie. I quite liked how the grand witch's mouth split open from time to time to reveal her ""witchiness"".Apparently a bunch of disability advocates, including British Paralympic swimmer Amy Marren, got unhinged and claimed the movie was ""perpetuating bias against individuals with ectrodactyly and other limb differences.""Seriously? Get a grip. It is fiction and a family movie about witches for Christ sake! Presenting witches or other supernatural creatures as having ""abnormalities"" like crows feet, fangs and God knows what is what makes witches. If these obsessive whiners and cancel culture freaks would have their way no movie worth watching and no book worth reading would ever be made.Anyway, I felt it was an hour and 45 minutes that I enjoyed.",The Witches
55,SnobReviews,A CGI driven bore.,4,27 October 2020,"""The Witches"" misses opportunities and makes me wonder why director Robert Zemeckis continues to make mediocre films. Take a break, Zemeckis.In this fantasy film set in 1968 Alabama, an orphaned young boy stumbles across a conference of witches while staying with his grandmother at a hotel. Based on the book by Roald Dahl.Aside from fun performances from Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer, ""The Witches"" relies too much on CGI, which in my opinion is making movies worse with every use. What happened to getting a real cat in a movie? Is it really about animal rights or more because Hollywood doesn't want to train an animal to sit on Anne Hathaway's forearm? Chris Rock as the narrator was a nice touch and the highlight of the film. Overall, I think Robert Zemeckis should take a break from making movies to find his groove again, because right now it's getting tired.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!",The Witches
56,fluffchop,Pales by comparison to the original,2,9 March 2021,"I thought oh great a remake of this, but sadly no, it's very slow to start and never really does get going. It's not terrible but just a big let down over the original. I wouldn't have bothered had I known.",The Witches
57,jamiedarlow-37510,Very fun but unmemorable remake,6,28 February 2021,"Robert Zemeckis (Back To The Future, The Polar Express) directs this retelling of Roald Dahl's classic story. In the late 1960s, a young boy (Jahzir Bruno) goes to live with his grandma (Octavia Spencer) after the tragic death of his parents. Very quickly it appears he is the target of a group of evil sneaky witches led by the Grand High Witch (Anne Hathaway) so Grandma takes him away to a seaside hotel where they shouldn't be found. Unfortunately, they happen to choose the hotel where the Witches are gathering for a meeting to discuss hunting every last child 🎃💀 the children's book by Dahl is notoriously dark and deliciously twisted, leading to an adaptation by director Nicholas Roeg (Don't Look Now) back in 1990, starring the brilliant Angelica Huston. I'm going to try my best not to compare it to the original as I have a nostalgic fondness there. This remake is a very fun kids movie that will satisfy any pint sized person seeking a good scare 😀 the visual effects are lovely which is to be expected from the visual mastery behind Zemeckis' vision and from co-writer Guillermo Del Toro (The witches facial and limbic contortions are beautifully Del Toro influenced!) Hathaway is having so much fun here and she's incredible to watch, especially when she snarls and hisses her way across the room, sure to scar a new generation of kids interested in Dahl's stories 😀",The Witches
58,W011y4m5,Why?,3,23 March 2021,"It's genuinely staggering to learn how the writers, directors & producers involved in this production included names (of legendary filmmakers) such as Alfonso Cuarón, Robert Zemeckis & Guillermo Del Toro... With so much accomplished talent in front of & behind the camera, one does genuinely wonder how this film turned out quite as badly as it did.On the plus side, considering how much of a hot mess ""The Witches"" is, I can at least appreciate the sheer ridiculousness of it - because if anything, at least it's bold in its questionable creative choices, which I believe were absolute failures. Hence, there's fun to be had, regardless.For instance, Anne Hathaway's portrayal is especially enjoyable here, due to the fact that her character suffers from one of the most unintentionally inconsistent pronunciations ever put to screen; is she playing Golem from Lord of The Rings, using the Scandinavian accent or Russian? Nobody knows. Irrespective, she's visibly having immense fun being so garishly extravagant & therefore, we do too.However, poor Octavia Spencer - being saddled with endless, informative dialogue which is the equivalent verbal diarrhoea, but with exposition. Did she have one line that wasn't a narration for the audience?It's an odd movie we find ourselves laughing at whilst watching, rather than laughing with... But I did admittedly laugh, nonetheless.",The Witches

2020
PG
Director: Robert Zumeckis
Starring: Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci, Chris Rock, Jahzir Bruno, Codie Lei Eastick, Kristen Chenowith etcOverall rating 70/100The witches is based on the Roald Dahl novel, and is based on a little boy and his grandmother have a run in with a coven of witches intend on destroying all children. The witches was a lot of fun, very flawed but was definitely an entertaining watch so lets get started.First of all I thought the concept was fun, the cinematography and performances were great and the characters and actors had great chemistry with each other. The concept of the movie was a lot of fun with the coven of witches, the movie really went into a lot of detail which I loved, and the witches wanting to destroy all the children was a fun concept for the character motivations. I also thought the cinematography was excellent. The movie looked visually fantastic, the movies vibrant colours and excellent set locations really popped out to me and the character design of the witches was excellent. The performances were also great, Octavia Spencer as expected was fantastic, she commanded each scene she was in, she was funny charming and she bought her character to life amazingly, but Anne Hathaway was truly amazing. She went all out for her role she was excellent, she was campy, over the top and terrifying she was definitely one of the best parts of the movie. I also thought that Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno had excellent chemistry with each other, their relationship was very heartwarming and felt very charming and authentic, they worked really well together throughout the movie.My next few positives would be the good set up, great character background as well as the charming but also dark tone. I thought the set up of both the main characters getting away for their protection from the witches only to coincidently be where all the witches are going set up the conflict in a fun way, and gave the movie a lot to play with. I also appreciated the character background, learning about the little boys parents and his grandma taking him in really strengthened their bond which I loved, I also loved the background for Octavia Spencers character, linking her to the grand high witch was a great plot choice, as it raised the stakes for her character and made the defeat of the witch just as meaningful for her character as the young boy. The movie also had a very charming tone, the bond between the little boy and his grandma developed more and more as the movie went on, in the beginning especially the movie had a great charm to it. But I also found that the movie managed to execute a really good dark tone as well, the witches were actually pretty terrifying in places especially the grand high witch some of her powers were actually quite dark and some of the scenes would have definitely scared younger kids.However, my first few negatives would be the tonal inconsistencies, lapses in the logic and bad CGI in places. This movie for me was tonally all over the place, it didn't know whether it wanted to be a horror or comedy so it kind of got stuck in between for most of the movie, and a lot of it was very over the top as well. I also thought there was a few lapses in the logic, there was an incredibly dumb and irritating character that deliberately got caught for stupid not explainable reasons and got more and more irritating as the movie went on. I do also have to say that some of the CGI wasn't great. The rats looked very cheaply done and not very realistic at all, they just felt very out of place compared to the work done on The witches themselves especially Anne Hathaway.My final few negatives would be the odd narrative choices and questionable character decisions. I thought the movie made very odd narrative and character decisions, I personally didn't like the fact that the little boy turned into a rat, I think they should of kept it as 2 not 3 rats, because I thought the movie worked best when it was Octavia Spencer and Jahzir working together and the movie lost some of its charm because of this, and I found the narrative decision to keep him permanently as a rat was a slightly odd decision as well that didn't quite work.My final few positives would be the great worldbuilding and villains, the humour and finally the good themes and messages. The movie did a fantastic job with its worldbuilding and villains, the movie into great amounts of detail explaining everything about the witches, so you knew every little detail about them, this was a great job at making them much more intimidating and setting up the movies conflicts with the characters well. The movie was hilarious, Anne Hathaway did a fantastic job at her comedic delivery and the dialogue she was given was fantastic and suited her character very well. And finally the movie did have some good themes and messages. The movie did have heartwarming messages of loving someone no matter what they looked like which was one way in which the kids turning into rats worked.Overall, the witches is a fun and entertaining movie, which has plenty of charm and fantastic performances from Octavia Spencer and Anne Hathaway. But is too tonally conflicted and has to many flaws to be anything more than a fun watch.",The Witches
61,jakethesnake-42007,A complete mess what a joke,3,5 April 2021,What a complete mess of a movie. I enjoyed the first 30 min and then the witches came in the story and then it turns into a complete mess. Anne Hathaways acting is over the top camp mess. They could of made a good movie but it's not. Octavia Spencer was the only good thing in the film. Don't waste your time on this mess.,The Witches
62,Rendanlovell,Zemeckis strikes again,3,31 October 2020,"Robert Zemeckis always teases us with something that could be family fun and charming enough for adults. He frequently doesn't deliver like he used to. Which is the case yet again with The Witches. A movie so adverse to the art of filmmaking it constantly gives up in the middle of scenes.Robert still shows signs of life with some nice looking shots and editing that has some inspiration behind it. However, more times then not he feels like he's sleep walking. He's never been a director to deliver tour de force pitcures but he usually finds a balance between fun and dramatic. The typical shmaltzy music he uses is over bearing in this and the constant visual effects do this little favors.It's like Steven Spielbergs BFG but with less effort put in, which is saying something. Even basic scenes that start promising end with a CG extravaganza that made me want to hide away and forget I saw it. One scene in particular where the witches reveal their plan is one of the most embarrassing things this year. Robert can't help but flex his visual effects in this scene and it's a sight that made me want to stop and die.The overbearing use of CG definitely doesn't help, but neither does Anne Hathaway. Who is overacting to such an extreme it's unbearable. She is the main protagonist and is so laughable you can't see her as a threat at any point. She is so so bad in this and looks even worse when she shares scenes with Octavia Spencer. Who plays the grandma to the main child and is lovely. She is typically charismatic even if she isn't trying that hard. She knows what this is.Which is a family movie at the end of the day. It seems to want to drive in the Stuart Little lane of yesteryear. But I can't see any demographic of people enjoying this. It's a clunky disaster of bad acting, poor writting, and so much post work it feels plastic. There's no heart to this. There's no warmth in a movie that tries so hard to have some. Kids will be bored and adults will be horrified.",The Witches
63,bangel3322,Not a fan....,4,26 October 2020,"My score is for Octavia Spencer only. For me, she's better than the original grandma. She's more bubbly and kooky and I really liked that. Apart from that this film doesn't even touch the first one. I'm sorry to say but Anne Hathaway just didn't pull this off. She tried, but anyone who has seen the original, knows she had big boots to fill. Angelica Houston was amazing in the first movie and it was going to be very difficult for anyone to bring the same energy she brought. I've not read the book and so I don't know which of the films is more true to the book. This film is far more comical and suitable for younger children whereas the first one is quite a dark comedy and it balances scary with comedy really well and would've for slightly older children. It was just below average for me and it's a shame, however I didn't really expect it to be good.",The Witches
64,movieman6-413-929510,Witching remake for a new generation.,5,28 November 2020,"The Witches is a remake of the 1990 movie of the same name. This remake is directed, partly written and produced by Robert Zemeckis, the director of Forrest Gump and the Back to the Future trilogy.In the film, an orphaned boy (Jahzir Bruno) goes to live with his grandmother (Octavia Spencer). When he comes into contact with a witch, his grandmother tries to protect her grandson and they flee to a hotel on the coast. The two think they are safe here, but the boy discovers that the hotel is being used for a witch gathering. The head witch has a devil plan that he has to stop the hotel with his grandmother and friends.This remake puts the famous story of writer Roald Dahl in a modern guise and can thus become a new classic for children of this current generation. For parents it can be fun to watch this movie with their children, especially if they are familiar with the original 1990 film. Although this film is not as good as the original, it does contain some nice hints and references. .With the help of Guillermo del Toro as co-writer and producer, Robert Zemeckis provides good and fun effects in the film. For older viewers, some images may seem a bit fake due to the use of CGI effects. Halfway through, the film comes across more like a Stuart Little remake for the children. Yet they have provided a good mix between visual and computer effects for a family film.The acting is done appropriately by most of the film cast as well. That Jahzir Bruno is still a novice actor, older viewers can sometimes see in his acting. For a first children's film, he does well for a younger audience. Octavia Spencer delivers the best acting in the movie as the caring wise grandmother, who tries to help and protect her grandson from the witches. Anne Hathaway delivers appropriate, but some special acting. Her character in the film has a somewhat distinct Scandinavian accent, which sometimes comes out better than the other. Sometimes she also speaks as Gollum the character from The Lord of the Rings movies. Despite portraying her character more in her own modern way, she doesn't come close to how Anjelice Huston played the role in the original version.",The Witches

Firstly, the plot, that was based on Roald Dahl, is very interesting,, it shows how love and family can beat the evil.

67,TheCorniestLemur,A bit butchered,3,8 March 2021,"I read Roald Dahl's books ad-nauseam as a kid, so I was probably always going to not like this. I mean, Robert Zemeckis likely hasn't made anything good since Cast Away, and that definitely hasn't changed with this. He occupies a similar place to George Lucas, in that I think he just forgot what he was doing over time.But anyway, I can't stand the changes they made from the book, absolutely none of them add anything to it. However...I do give it some props for sticking to the ending of the book, which I won't spoil but you could never get away with it in a kids' book nowadays.And before I dump all over the rest of this, I will just admit that I did at least find Anne Hathaway somewhat entertaining. By god, she was clearly having fun.And everyone else is baaaaaaad. The kids seem to get worse and worse as the film goes on, Octavia Spencer could not have cared less, and Stanley Tucci is in it because of...reasons. The story's fine, even if it is just entirely lifted from the book with no good changes and less personality, it's not well shot, and the dialogue is really bad.In terms of production design, I thought it looked quite nice...until they started trying CGI. Holy god, the effects in this film look like they could have been done in the original 1990 film.I can't really pretend to have any major boiled anger for this film though, it's just...a thing that exists. And it's probably already been forgotten as I'm writing this, but just in case it isn't, just go read the book.Especially if you also hate children and want to see them dying earlier than they should.",The Witches
68,jamesjustice-92,Whatever happened to Bobby Z?,5,1 January 2021,"I don't know what is going on with Robert Zemeckis in the recent years but I don't seem to recognize the legendary director of Romancing the stone, the Back to the future trilogy (which is my favorite), Who framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump and Cast away anymore. None of the movies he made over the past twenty years couldn't come close to being great, The witches is sadly no exception. Although I absolutely adore Alan Silvestri and his fantastic, incredible score in this movie as well as its superb cinematography and amazing camera work I don't know what else is there I can name that stands out. Maybe Anne Hathaway's performance? But it was too over-the-top if you ask me, the same usual villain with no motivation whatsoever. Octavia Spencer at least tried to show some depth of her character but not enough for me to like her act. The visual effects are fine at best (but mostly mediocre). The story itself is too cartoonish and nonsensical despite spilling some grains of wise thoughts here and there. All in all if you evaluate this body of work as directed by Robert Zemeckis it deserves at least a 6 but if you're not affected by your own subjectiveness you would give it a solid 4.5 - as for me, I'm somewhere in the middle. What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good soundtrack - here it surely saves this disaster of a movie.",The Witches
69,Hallelujah289,"Fun moments, low stakes",7,29 October 2020,"Very fun performance by Anne Hathaway. Cool costume design. Some new magic for the witches. Good way to pass an evening with some kids in for some fun but spooky times.I would've liked it much scarier though. The mice kids really aren't in any danger much of the time. The chefs didn't even take any shots at them. The witches have genuinely scary powers and that just wasn't represented here. Without the danger element this is not really the kind of film adults also like, but just too safe and better for kids.This version has a different ending too. I don't mind the differences this movie has but I'm not sure it's really thought through. Like I was saying about the lack of danger element, the ending kind of reverses that, so the movie is a strange mix of messages about risk and change and consequences.A fun film with some daring twists that don't quite pull off in my opinion. But it's rare enough for these kinds of remakes to take risks.I'm really giving it a 6/10 but will give a 7 just because I think it's very watchable and not every remake has to surpass a previous classic film.",The Witches
70,danybur,Routine and ... childish,5,31 May 2021,"SummaryA children's film unfortunately without double reading for adults, second adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel, somewhat routine and obviously with more digital effects than the first version, with an unleashed Anne Hathaway as main witch and an endearing Octavia Spencer.ReviewAfter a car accident, a boy is orphaned and is adopted by his grandmother (Octavia Spencer). To change the scene, the grandmother decides to spend a time with the child in a luxury hotel where a congress of witches who detests children at the beginning of the 60s is held.The Witches is the second adaptation of the homonymous novel by Roald Dahl, and not the only one where the writer takes children (and their parents) as targets of ironies and violence. In this case, the anecdote is quite minimal, since the boy and a friend are victims of a spell and then they will try to disrupt the secret coven with the help of the grandmother, who knows the world of witches.Unlike many animated films that admit a child and an adult reading, in this comedy everything is hopelessly childish and plain, with many digital effects absent in the first version. The leader of the witches is an unleashed Anne Hathaway (fearsome only in some moments) and perhaps the best thing about this Robert Zemeckis film is the initial realistic section when the depressed orphan begins to live with his grandmother. When you see them heading to such a hotel, an element of tension appears because one wonders if they would admit two African Americans at that time, but the script uchronically resolves that they would.The morale? Resilience, perseverance, courage and a love that goes beyond appearances.",The Witches

72,drunken_munki,A poor showing in many areas,4,24 October 2020,"The entire film seems to be CGI with bluescreen to put people on the scenes -- it looks gaudy and off putting -- and I don't like it.The acting is over the top and the music is too dramatic with most of the plot dragging on when the cast is in the hotel part of the movie.I liked the New Orleans backdrop in the first 10 minutes, but there wasn't much of it; which begs the question why rewrite the story and take it out of London in the first place. The CGI animals were average looking but not my chief complaint of this piece.In the end it was a below average experience that I would just say go and watch the original movie and skip this, but even so I rated that one as an average flick.

I thought it was odd that Kristen Chenoweth played the voice of a child, especially given that her voice is so recognizable. Why couldn't the childhood friend who was turned into a chicken talk, while the children who were turned into mice could? Anjelica Huston's Grand High Witch was scarier, although Anne Hathaway's mouth was pretty freaky and reminded me of the Joker.

74,lyubitelfilmov,"Mice against the charm of Anne Hathaway or So bad, it's even good",5,3 November 2020,"Comedy horror, fantasy. A screen adaptation of the children's novel of the same name by the English writer Roald Dahl and, at the same time, a ""rethinking"" of the film of the same name, released thirty years ago. I have not read the book, I am partially familiar with the first film adaptation (scene, characters, scenario and ending), so I will evaluate it exclusively from my own bell tower. I understand that this review comes out on the eve of Halloween, which I am not celebrating, but it just coincided. I really missed my favorite cinema (hello May!), So I decided to go to the screening, but nothing good came across until I accidentally stumbled upon this picture. And here's my brief opinion - it's so bad that it's even good. The picture has, in addition to a heap of shortcomings, also advantages, and now your humble servant will disassemble them.
So, the advantages:
1. Anne Hathaway - I confess that it was the beautiful Anne who persuaded me to see this creation. I was hoping to see a charming villain who would make insidious plans to ""conquer the world"" or something similar, captivating the viewer with her outfits and demeanor. And he was not deceived in this. Ann here is almost the only bright spot that attracts attention to herself and makes her follow her every step. Her appearance reminded me very much of Tim Burton's ""Dark Shadows"", namely the main villainess in the brilliant performance of Eva Green. It seems to me that she was chosen when creating the image for Ann. Wig, manners, behavior, well, except that here Ann does not seduce men, because we have here a comedy horror film for teenagers, and not Burton's comedy thriller, designed for an older audience. But the image was clearly too clever, and sometimes her actions cause more bewilderment. Well, Ann sometimes overestimates too much. But I repeat - she is here - the main celebrity and the most memorable character, more precisely the villain.
2. Scenario - if you have not fallen asleep within the first twenty minutes, then you will find such an enchanting idiocy (I will mention the key features in the minuses) that the brain explodes. The script is so stupid, stupid and at the same time periodically feverish that it is amazing. But this is so bad that it is even good. At least I laughed at this orgy, for which, by the way, the director Robert Zemeikis and Guillermo del Toro were responsible, and a couple more people. Looks like the brainstorming was not without the participation of some funny powders and a whole box of strong liquor in order to get this at the exit.
3. Humor - I hoped to laugh at jokes, but in the end I was amused by one of the photos at the very beginning of the picture, and the stupid script. Thank God that I did not watch the first film adaptation, otherwise I would have had to cry bitterly from what they did to one of the pictures of my childhood.
So the disadvantages:
1. Blacks - in the first film adaptation, the main characters were white, but since we do not live in ""barbaric times"", but in a ""progressive age"", the writers replaced the heroes with blacks, but they did not think of working out the historical background in which the main action picture. Where is the contempt for blacks? Where is the ""peacock"" of the whites? Why is the protagonist's grandmother taken seriously in, for a minute, the most expensive hotel in Alabama - the southern state of the United States, where ONLY rich white people stay, and blacks work there only as service personnel with the lowest wages?
2. Mockery of the first film adaptation - the scene was moved from England to the United States, the witches were not ugly, but young and attractive, a logical scenario with a clear motivation for the first film adaptation turned into a natural farce where everything happens just like that. The only plus of this picture is the finale, which is one in one book, albeit a little harsh. I understand why fans and fans of the old film adaptation are so enraged by this one, which only tramples on their nostalgia.
3. Nothing new - this adaptation does not provide anything new (we do not take special effects into account). She only mocks the finished material. I really hope that the picture will fail at the box office, because it did not deserve a different fate.
4. Jokes - they are stupid and not funny at all. What I was hoping for! Good humor? Wake up, now it's rare.
And I also liked the music, for which I should thank the composer Alan Silvestri, who brightened up all this disgrace with his high-quality work. I learned for myself several new musical compositions.
A little about the main characters:
1. Miss Eva Ernst, played by Anne Hathaway, is the leader of the witches who arranged a coven in a luxury hotel. She did not even suspect that this would be the beginning of a series of adventures. The charming Ann shone here. I literally enjoyed every shot of her (well, almost every one). I was also pleased with the Russian dubbing, because the actress was very well chosen for this type. Kisses to Ann's hand!
2. The grandmother performed by Octavia Spencer is the grandmother of the protagonist, whose actions sometimes cause bewilderment, but the kind character and religiosity try to smooth out the overall impression. Nice and kind character, and the actress definitely coped with the role.
3. Mister Stringer performed by Stanley Tucci - one of the best comedians here plays the faded and with a bad sense of humor hotel administrator. I thought that Stanley would be another decoration of the picture, on a par with the beautiful Anne, but no. Periodically appears and behaves in some scenes stupid and you can even catch Spanish shame. Eh Stanley! Where have you taken!
Another Hollywood ""rethinking"" that awaits oblivion, and I really hope - a box office failure. Another unsuccessful picture by Robert Zemeikis, which brings the decline of his career even closer. Only Anne Hathaway holds this picture with her hands, but her strength is clearly not enough for the picture to be at least ""good"". I didn't give a lower mark just because the picture amused me, although not in the way I planned.
As a result, we have a terrible film adaptation with an idiotic clownade, which is called a ""script"" here, excellent music and stunning acting performance of Anne Hathaway and a little less noticeable Stanley Tucci, well, and blacks, where can we go without them.",The Witches

People may also find other ways or reasons to hate it (probably involves current issues politics bs etc.) but seriously it's not bad. You also have to remember these movies are kids movies based on a kids book so if your pissed that a movie from your childhood has been remade, that's sad. At least they waited 30 years to do it. The first one is a lot scarier but that's because of the awesome makeup and not cgi.",The Witches
77,hunter-friesen,"""The Witches"" casts a weak spell",5,26 October 2020,"I've always wondered what Robert Zemeckis thinks of his career. From 1984 to 2000, he was an A-level director who could seamlessly blend visual wizardry with fantastical stories. His output during that time consisted of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Forrest Gump"" (for which he won the Best Director Oscar), and ""Cast Away"".Since then, Zemeckis has still incorporated fantastical ideas into his films, but his effects work has gotten progressively worse as time goes on. ""The Polar Express"" is only remembered for its acid-trip inducing digital-capture performances. ""Beowulf"", ""A Christmas Carol"", and ""Welcome to Marwen"" were visual eye-sores. Even his adult-oriented films such as ""Flight"" and ""Allied"" - which are decent - came and went with barely a peep.Zemeckis has returned once again to the silver screen (or silver television since it's being released on HBO Max) with ""The Witches"", another movie filled to the brim with computer effects and a crazy story. Unfortunately, this new feature follows right in line with the latter of his filmography and again makes you wonder if we'll ever get the old Robert Zemeckis back.""The Witches"" is an adaptation of the classic Roald Dahl children's book of the same name. It was most famously adapted for the screen in 1990 with Anjelica Huston starring as the Grand High Witch.""The Witches"" is narrated by Chris Rock, who in the opening segment explains to the audience that witches are real and are here to prey on little children, especially cute ones. This claim is supported by our narrator's encounter with witches back in his childhood.From here we travel back in time to 1960s Alabama. Our narrator, named Charlie, has just become an orphan after a freak car accident. He moves in with his grandmother, a lady who would "" spank you when you deserved it and hug you when you needed it"". After some time, Charlie eventually comes face to face with a witch, which brings up memories from grandma's past as well. As a precaution, the two of them head to a swanky resort to hide away for a while. Unfortunately for them, this resort is the same location where a coven of witches are planning their nefarious scheme of turning every child into a mouse so that they can be easily squashed. It's up to Charlie and his grandma to stop these witches before they cause the extinction of all children.Despite being in a slump for nearly two decades, Robert Zemeckis is still a capable director when it comes to blockbuster filmmaking. ""The Witches"" still showcases his talent with the camera as he uses a few tricks such as long tracking shots that dip and dive throughout the resort setting. It is kind of cheating since it's obvious the camera and much of the set are digitally created, but it's still nice to look at nonetheless.While the visual style of the film is in line with Dahl's authorial vision, their quality is not up to the technological standards of 2020. With their razor-sharp teeth, hanging talons, and bald heads, the witches are pure nightmare fuel that will surely haunt small children (and adults) for days after. They may not look convincing, but they sure look frightening.Even though the witch effects kept things scary, the mouse effects did not hold up their end of the deal. The entire second half of the film is soiled because of the poor effects work on the rodents. Shockingly, mouse special effects have not progressed in the slightest since ""Stuart Little"" (""Ratatouille"" doesn't count since that's all digital).Filling in the role of the Grand High Witch is Anne Hathaway, who gives a no-holds-barred performance complete with heavy accent work and villainous speech patterns. She's more cartoonish than most cartoons, which makes her the most memorable of the cast.Octavia Spencer as the grandmother and Stanley Tucci as the resort manager are much more subdued in their roles, which makes Hathaway stick out even more from the rest of the cast.The child actors that play both their human selves and voice their mouse counterparts rely too much on overacting to get the point across. Their performances can be both blamed on themselves and Zemeckis' lackluster acting direction and screenplay, which was co-written by monster aficionado Guillermo del Toro of all people. Nearly all their dialogue is said in all caps with three exclamation points.""The Witches"" may not live up to its print and celluloid predecessors, but it has just enough campiness and visual splendor that keeps it exciting from start to finish. It's not a good film - or even one I wholly recommend - but it's something that can be semi-enjoyed by the whole family during the waning days of spooky season.",The Witches

If you read all the negative reviews they are mostly from those who think one race or color can do abetter job and question the cast. Who cares!! Watch it, smile, enjoy and go on with your lives! Don't rate a movie lower because a character is not of the race in the original or what YOU wanted. The rest reviewers who are asking why the movie was even made? Here's the truth about those nonsense reviews, MOST of them did NOT watch the movie so their reviews are biased and inappropriate. Nothing wrong with remakes and this is a great story to remake. It's a kid's movie, but we see old angry folks sitting behind a keyboard and trashing a good story.Is the movie, the best ever 10/10 Well, not really... Is it good? Yes it is! Is the movie better than the original( I watched the original 3 times)? No it is not,but it has a great flare and spins. It a nice refresh and a story you want to experience again. Not to mention the fact, millenials often don't want to see 30-year old movies and they would connect better. So if you are 50, and angry, it is YOU who is a problem. Young teens really enjoyed this one and the actors they like. It's as simple as that so take it easy!! It's a great story and I was delighted to see another angle of it. That is all.

80,nebk,A Lazy Witch Hunt,3,25 October 2020,The Witches had the potential to be an entertaining movie due to Anne Hathaway and Olivia Spencer but it is way too simple with lazy writing and in my opinion it has one of the worst endings seen in a film.When the parents of a boy are killed tragically in an accident in 1968 he ends up living with his grandmother who tells him that witches are real and are not even women but demons. They go to a hotel in Alabama and they have the misfortune to be there at the same time as a witch coven gathering. The witches have a plan to turn all children into mice and eliminate them. They turn the boy into a mouse and he together with two other children who were turned into mice and his grandmother had to defeat the coven led by the high witch. They do this by feeding the witches the same potion that was used to turn them into mice and it ends up turning the witches into ugly looking rats. And then they leave with a huge pile of money and potion and a list of all witches in the world and plan to turn them into rats as well. About 45 seconds is spent trying to turn the children back into their human form and then they shrug their shoulders and say well it's ok beeing a mouse. The boy even asks how long mice live and the grandmother says that regular mice live three years but that they might live three times that which is ok with the boy who is happy he won't have to go to school and they can die together. The grandmother doesn't seem to be too bothered either which is strange to say the least since the indication is that none of these poor children will see past their mid teens but at least they can have fun with all the money. And then they show us a scene 11 years later with an aged mouse talking to children and sending them out on a mission to eliminate witches. Obviously someone was not good at math since 1979 is about two years past the mice life span according to the film.Another issue is why does the potion work on witches who are not even human? Why doesn't the grandmother try to find an antidote when she captures the head witch instead of feeding her to her cat familiar. In the beginning it is said that a witch gets the same pleasure from squashing children as a normal person would from eating ice cream. And then 25 minutes later it is said they hate the smell of children since children smell like dog poop... soooo....dog poop ice cream that they get enjoyment out of squashing. Someone should have read through this script more. The good things are the effects and the adult actors although Anne Hathaway changes her accent throughout the movie. She was still entertaining but not enough to improve this movie which has a terrible ending. A 3 out of 10.,The Witches
81,Golden_Hope,Completely Pointless,2,29 November 2020,"This was one of the most pointless remakes i have ever seen. It just takes away from the original and that is not what you want when you are making a remake.Like i was looking forward to seeing the hotel in this film. The original hotel was so iconic to me, it just really stuck with me and when i watched it was like like i really want to go to this fabulous hotel on the cost in the UK. This hotel looked so bad, i honestly think it was CGI. It looked fake, like all the exterior shots looked like it was a CGI hotel.Speaking of CGI, there is so much in this film and it just looks stupid. They lean so heavy on it. The original uses make up and animatronics so well and it just works to make the film seem more rooted in our word and just more pleasing to look at. I also think it is incredibly lazy to just CGI. That word pretty much sums up this movie.The acting was fine apart from Anne who was chewing up the scenery like it was going out of fashion. She was the best part of the move i guess. Well her costumes were to be honest. But they even used CGI in her costumes!! It was infuriating. Her accent was absolutely horrible tho. She should have just used her normal accent.I would say you could defiantly skip this one. Just watch the original.",The Witches

But...the imagery-they really got out of hand. I get it's supposed to be dark, but the creepy imagery went a little too far over the deep end. I usually like dark movies (for example: Edward Scissorhands, Into the Woods, Corpse Bride), but I don't like when it gets TOO dark. I liked the human forms of the witches WAY better than their true demon forms.So...4/10.",The Witches

85,HorrorOverEverything,"A Fun Remake, Was Surprised To See So Many Negative Reviews",7,28 October 2020,"Me and my fiancé decided on a whim the other night to watch this, we are both fans of the original and had recently watched it a week prior. We didn't read any reviews or anything, just went into it with a open mind and some time to kill.Right away I was impressed by the cast, for a goofy kids movie this really had a lot of stand out performances, Octavia Spencer did a great job as the loveable grandma. Anne Hathaway plays a fun vilain, and Jahzir Bruno is a very likeable main character.There are a lot of changes to the original storyline but I was fine with that, if you want to see the exact same story from the original you can simply watch the original. I liked that they changed some things up, it made this more of a fresh experience rather than a generic Rehash.I've seen a lot of complaints about the CGI, which I understand since I will personally always prefer practical effects, however I was pretty impressed with the majority of the CGI in this film. A lot of the CGI heavy scenes are actually really creative and fun to watch.Overall I had a lot of fun watching this movie, I think instead of judging it for not being as good as the original you'd be better off just looking at it as it's own movie. On it's own its a fun, goofy, kid's movie that I am happy I watched,7/10",The Witches

91,GavWaskett,"If you get offended by someone really disliking a film, I'd skip this review if I were you!",2,15 November 2020,"Ooooookaaaaaaay, before I get into this and believe me, I'm going to get into it, let me set the scene. I love Roald Dahl, I love The Witches, I'm currently reading it to my class at the end of the day (my Grand High Witch would fit right at home as Herr Flick's eviller other half from Allo Allo) and I love the 1990 film. Now normally I'd be a bit wary of Roald Dahl remakes, but after watching the trailer, the change on location and era seemed to work and the cast of Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer and Stanley Tucci is incredibly strong, so we thought why no give it go.And it just goes to show, that you should stick to your instincts and the people who make trailers are veil geniuses.Adventure - I'll give you that, Comedy - not so much, Family - are you kidding me?The story changes from London to 1960s Alabama, from a Norwegian Grandma to a Deep South one, with a history from the turn of the century with Witches and in fact these changes fit in with the story and style of a Roald Dahl book, it maintains the creepiness of The Witches by giving them a believable backstory.However, when Hero Boy and Grandma(they're not given names in this film - which is a bit odd) check into a nearby hotel - again a diversion from the original for the reason, things go a bit, well rubbish really. For me it loses its Roald Dahl quality, its scariness mixed with fantasy and humour. It just goes a bit horrible really.
The Witches, who by rights, have no toes, are bald with itchy heads, huge nostrils and claws amongst others are turned into demons from your nightmares. I totally agree with those who got offended by their hands, which should be claws but not look like really long three-fingered things and I use the words things, even though I hate using that word in writing, they don't look like claws, they look like someone has had a bad accident. If I was someone who had Ectrodactyly, a limb abnormality, I'd look at it and think they were taking the mick!On top of that, the Witches mouths open up like something out of a nightmare I had after watching several Vampire series in one night, it's something out of V Wars or Van Helsing, not a family film. You've got it very wrong there Mr Zemeckis.And, my final point - to be fair I'm holding back as there is so much more, I could go on about, is the inclusion of the wonderful Kristen Chenoweth as the voice of a child who has been turned into a mouse, WHY? All other children whether real or mouse like are played by and voiced by children, why do they need the voice of a woman. It is just odd and takes away from the character, a character who by the way doesn't exist in the book.You can see the influence of Mr Zemeckis and Guillermo del Toro and if it wasn't changing such a huge part of not only my childhood but also my adulthood as a teacher then I might, nah who am I kidding, I'm regretting renting this, I could've spent my money on something I'd have enjoyed more instead - like dental surgery!I'm not going to score this as I don't think it would be fair to the very talented people involved and to be honest, I reckon children would probably really enjoy it, but adults if you've grown up with the original - swerve this please!",The Witches

This one lacks the charm, the creepiness and Angelica Houston.Anne Hathaway is a little over dramatic and not a patch on Angelica. The original witches were very creepy and disturbing, these not so much but I am 30 years older. My daughter has said they are really weird.Special effects can really kill a movie, just because you can use them doesn't mean you should, live action/models/animatronics can be better.I'm giving it a 10 because I think it deserves more than 5.4 but it's probably a 6 for me.",The Witches

I've read it to my daughter 5 times at least ( had to put my foot down to read another ) she loved the first movie and this one is even better ... don't understand at all why the rating is so low- I hate to say it but I think it's because of the updates. This movie has some differences - what remake doesn't? The big differences are that the main boy and grandma are not white. ( hence the people who don't ""like"" this movie) ( amazing to me when white people have sooo many issues with characters not being white and can't understand at the same time why it's imperative that we do make movies that are more diverse) This is not set in Europe. It's set in 1960s America- And that's about it... except the special effects are insanely good - the grand master witch is truly scary and my kids were soo scared of her it was almost borderline for them- my son hid under his blanket at times and my daughter had to sit on my lap, for a lot of parts ( theyre 6 and 7) ... I absolutely adored this film and thought it was a wonderful remake! I thought it was better than the first.... and the kids LOVED it... they already asked to watch it tomorrow. Don't believe the bad reviews- They all have terrible taste. In many ways this movie is superior to the original and at the least , as good as. It's just slightly different than the book- the movie followed the book exactly .. this one made some changes, but they made an altogether wonderful film and the kids are going to love it!

Anne Hathaway is usually good, but her accent was distracting, sometimes we were German, then Transylvanian, not sure who's idea that was. My little boy loves the movie and really that's the target audience. So he doesn't card if her accent is awful.Octavia is likable in almost anything she does. The grandmothers character in the first one wasn't an award winner, so you can't expect too much out of what she has to work with. All in all an entertaining movie and I like new origin stories.

102,seige-hound,tonally all over the place,6,5 December 2020,"This film was weirdly inconsistent with its tone. The book and the original movie both had scary parts but they were both overall kids stories with some adult humour sprinkled in, but this film had both moments that were too kiddy, and moments that were straight up IT levels of horror.This movie is rated M here in Australia (PG-13 equivalent) and in terms of content, there are definitely parts that stand out as being deserving of that rating. This movie will straight up scar kids if they watch it too young, in particular the scene where the main character transforms into a mouse, as well as the design of the Grand High Witch (played wonderfully by Anne Hathaway) whose stretchd out grin and three-fingered claw hands are somewhat reminiscient of Pennywise from IT.However, once the kids are changed into mice, the film becomes a very silly kids movie, becoming entirely tonally distinct from the first half of the movie, to the point that a lot of the tension that was in the original book is removed and pacified.One significant change from the book and first adaptation is the fact that the main character (who remains nameless in this version like in the book) and his Grandma are black. Of course, I have no issue with this, and I think that they do some interesting stuff with it in the beginning, but they seem to forget this change and play the rest of the film straight from the pages. For example, when Grandma and the kid first arrive at the hotel, they put an emphasis on the fact that most of the hotel staff are black and are surprised that they are serving a black woman and her grandson instead of their usual white guests, but none of the other characters, not even the white upper class guests seem to care. Keep in mind that the film is set in the 1970s in the Southern United States.Another addition is the character of Mary. In the book, the main character had a pet mouse, and that remains true in this adaptation, but a new change was that the pet mouse is also, coincidentally, a person who was transformed into a mouse by a witch before the events of the film, and just coincidentally ended up in the main character's hands. I'm guessing this, alongside the decision to expand the role of Bruno (the other kid who is changed into a mouse) was done to make the ending of the film less tragic than the book. In the end of the book, the main character stays a mouse for the rest of his life, and it's implied that he and his grandmother die together because mice don't live that long. This was also changed in the 1990 movie, where a good witch turns the main character back into a human, but this version is an in-between, that while the kids stay mice, all three of them stay together, and wit hthe help of Grandma, start a witch hunting club, which I think is an okay ending.Overall, this film's weird tonal issues is my main problem with this film. Too scary for kids, and too childish for older Roald Dahl fans, but there were still plenty of moments that were enjoyable. While I don't particularly like the older 1990 movie, I would say that one is a bit better over this one.",The Witches
103,carolrmag,Sadly didn't like it,3,1 December 2020,"I had great fun with the original as a kid. Didn't rewatched it now to compare the both, but I don't remember being scared. People say the first one is scarier but for me this one was scarier. I read a comment on youtube where a person stated that in the first movie there was a witch and in the second an alien. I couldn't agree more. And the Alien was much creepier to me (That awful creepy smile, those hands and extending arms...) The actors are great and the special effects are updated to today's tech. Didn't like the changes in the story. Okay, so in my personal experience: found it scarier and the ending with a sad note. Not joyful at all.",The Witches

106,terrencepatrix,Just not good unfortunately.,2,23 October 2020,"I just don't understand why they remade this movie, especially since they did it almost scene for scene only worse. Unlike some other comments I didn't mind the spin of swapping the main characters out for African Americans, I just don't think it added anything.It's hard pinpointing exactly what went wrong here, but the whole film just felt off, you didn't feel like you were watching actual characters...but actors acting like characters, which makes a huge difference. Octavia Spenser has done some great roles throughout the years and she just didn't seem to put much effort into this. Anne Hathaway has also done some great roles...and it seems she put TOO much effort into it. It felt like she was trying too hard the whole time. And every other character is basically forgettable, including the lead child. Who was actually pretty good I think, just underutilized because the voice over by Chris Rock basically stole all the kids thunder by explaining everything he had already done, was doing, or going to do. Let the damn kid act.Finally there was something odd with the special effects, some scenes lead me to believe they might have originally intended for this to be in 3D for a theatrical release, so you have these weird CGI sequences where they're reaching or running right at the screen and it comes off looking out of place. Which was really the case for the whole movie, just nothing seemed to work together and it results in a movie that just feels completely unneeded.As a complete side note on what could have actually worked...change up the story a little bit to have the black leads have an actual backstory as to why they're there. If they'd put a French spin on it then the African Americans could have been the descendants of Creole slaves or immigrants who'd had dealings with witches on the European continent. I think that would have been a fun twist instead of just essentially making them movie props for a diversity quota.",The Witches

As an adult this movie was not made for me, but I still got enjoyment out of it. I like to write reviews taking two things into account: Target audience and Genre.Giving this a 1 just because its not as good as the original is really unfair, especially since most people who are rating are rating upon their own adult bias.This film is a lot of fun, the plot wasn't cliché and the acting was solid. Based loosely on Dahl's writing, it avoids a lot of the pre-generated story telling that makes the basis of most adventure films for a younger audience that Hollywood keeps squirting out in the past few decades.The Witches is interesting and gives some good lessons to children about greed, teamwork, acceptance etc. The CGI isn't perfect, and its a little over done. But it is intentional. And whilst Dahl might be turning over in his grave, it doesn't detract away from the fact that for kids, this film is lighthearted, fun and enjoyable.9/10",The Witches

125,darryl-jason,Huston vs Hathaway,5,12 November 2020,"I mainly watched this movie cause I was curious about how the effects of this remake would be in comparison to the original 1990 movie, & I have to say although the movie is quite enjoyable to watch it really doesn't live up to the original. Having never really been a fan of Anne Hathaway and only seeing her in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" which believe me, I don't think I'll ever watch that movie the same way again after seeing ""The Witches"" (2020), there's just something about her character of The Grand High Witch that didn't really give me the chills as much as the original (if at all). In the original Anjelica Huston was known to frighten many that I know of, myself included, with her 4 hours of make-up I should bloody well think so and all. But here, in the 2020 remake it seems there's little to no effort at all. And like many of the reviews here, there's a lot of scenes in this movie that have been cut which were originally in the 1990 classic, as for Hathaway's accent; yes I do see the change in it throughout the movie, there's no consistency with it - is she Russian or British? I think I can safely say she's been well and truly mis-cast here, it isn't the right film for her & if you read the trivia section it mentions other possible actresses that were considered for the role & most of them would have been far better. For me, this isn't a terrible film but it's not blockbuster of the year either. Entertaining for kids yes and comedic elements are there but I will always think more of the original. Hathaway is no Huston.",The Witches
126,actaction,Acting Performances Lift Up Remake,7,28 December 2020,"Anne Hathaway does a perfectly evil and memorable villain and Spenser as the grandmother, in a meatier role than what the original had, plays a wonderful hero. The effects don't have as much charm as Henson's muppets in the original, but they are cute and done well. The production has more money in screen, is sleeker, is known to be a hit verses the first which looks like (and may have been) a TV movie that exceeded expectations due to being awesome. I chose not to directly compare the two films while watching & that let me enjoy it on its own terms. There is a lot to enjoy here. The feeling of it is right where it needs to be, the cinematography is top notch, creepy and daunting, cartoonishly foreboding, but still a proper kids movie (for kids that are mature enough to take it). It was an interesting direction for the film to take setting it in Alabama, USA with a black cast. This ensured it wouldn't be trying to rehash the same film again (which you can't... the original is classic). They went their own way with it, included American topics of racism, classism, poverty... and it did it in a way that adults have something to work with and kids will get the gist about. I enjoyed it.",The Witches
127,STEVE24BUS,Not as good as the original but it has it's moments.,6,1 November 2020,"I remember my kids loving the original, but I found this a little darker and probably not suitable for younger children. It was amusing but decayed a little into slapstick halfway through. The animation's good, but Anne Hathaway is no Bet Midler. Should still keep the kids entertained enough though, and maybe parents who haven't seen the original. That's the problem with remakes, the deck's stacked against them from the start if the original was a decent film.",The Witches
128,Larsii90,An absolute travesty,4,1 November 2020,"I'm ashamed to admit this, but I saw this before I saw the original Witches. I've seen pieces of the original, but never the whole thing. When this came I was super excited, but man was it a letdown. I did enjoy the setting, set pieces, costumes and change of the kid and grandmother for a more modern take. But that was pretty much it. The film relies heavily on CGI, and the CGI is really bad. Not believable and definitely not scary. The film seriously lacked any heart and was just poorly made. Saw the original after this and it was a complete masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage. That one was scary, and had great special effects. An absolute waste of a great concept that could greatly benefit for a modern take and upgrade. Severely disappointed!",The Witches

130,benm-41751,Not an enjoyable or pleasant movie after the first third,4,27 October 2021,"I was truly settled in for a good movie after the first third or so of this film, since Octavia Spencer was wonderful as the grandmother, the setting seemed on point, and there seemed to be the right amount of eerie suspense and witchy intrigue building.But after that, all the intrigue and momentum of the movie completely falls off. We are introduced to the witches, who turn out not to be very interesting, and we are stuck in the hotel for the rest of the movie. An endless slog of a scene takes place in the conference room where the witches are meeting. Anne Hathaway does a good job as the creepy witch, but her character is just one long note that never ends. The witches are too shallow and boring to interest adults, but way too creepy and scaley to appeal to kids.The rest of the movie degrades to a very, very basic kid's movie romp with boring CGI mice. I have not read the source material and I'm sure faithfulness to the book was a factory in the storyboarding here, but if that's the case then they should have taken some liberties and put some actual twists as well as some character development.I was very disappointed, as I had faith in the style and humor of the movie but it all fell very flat very fast.",The Witches

It is pain when someone turns your childhood memories and twists them a bit and then polishes and gives them back, only they are transformed now and you don't connect to them. This will always be the problem of remakes.But let me just be clear, Mulan was remade, I hadn't watched that original either, still I found the remake disgusting, it was a terrible movie.

But his new movie The witches, which I have just watched here in pattaya at major cineplex is likely one of his worst works.It lacks the magic and charisma of much of his previous works. I absolutely agree that this is not for kids below 14; plus being forced to watch Octavia spencer dancing is a painful experienced I had to endure, and I wasn't easy.Chris rock does a nice work as the narrator of the story and the supporting role of Tucci as the hotel manager is pretty decent, but Hathaway as the lead witch was simply horrendous.I regret I went to the cinema for this, but I still love robert zemeckis",The Witches

I think young kids could potentially enjoy it if they've never seen the original but honestly why bother when you can watch the better one? And seriously, I want someone to explain why Anne Hathaway keeps getting hired for movies that she has to do accents in? This is the second movie I've watched with her talking in weird multiple accents that are not even close to what she is supposed to be talking in.

141,Jim_Screechy,Way better than the reviews here would have you believe.,7,26 October 2020,"I'd not heard of either this or the other version of this film prior to watching it. I simply came across it by accident and decided to see it... and, I quite enjoyed it. It's a good fun story that I'm fairly sure kids will generally like.That the nostalgia and memory of the 1990 version that seems to have anchored so many here to a polarised and negative opinion of this one is quite frankly ridiculous.A film has to be VERY bad before I would even consider giving it a 1/10 (which I have never done) and I was rather surprised to see so many handed out like sweets for this title. So much so, that I found and watched the original for comparison.To be quite honest, I think this is a better version, if only because it is period pertinent, but they both stand as great productions.The Jim Henson special effects of the first one are pretty good, and taking them out of context by comparing them with modern day capabilities isn't fair, and I only do so because it's something so many here have already done. Certainly for the time they were excellent, but there is no comparison with the new release where they are immeasurably more convincing.I don't necessarily want to do a side by side comparison between the two movies, I think they both stand by themselves for the era's in which they are released, but the notion that this film doesn't stand on its own is pure trash.The story, direction and in particular the acting from most of the cast are all very good, and in fact rather than go on, I'll simply say its an all round good film. Well set and well produced. Most of the reviews here are lopsided and unfair accounts of a good production that has stepped on the toes of a childhood or overly fond memory of the 1990 version.Your Kids will love it, and so did I. Its a Solid 6/10 but in the interest of fairness, I'm giving it 7.",The Witches

143,liberty_lee,Not what I was hoping for but maybe worth a look,5,28 October 2020,"I'm half way through as I write but I felt certain things needed to be said. I love Octavia Spencer and I cant fault bar character, shes animated, but plays it well enough. The little boy is fine too. Nice lot of celebrities also. It doesnt start as sinister as you would hope, I love the original film as a kid and adult, and the scary ness of it. It was fine until the first which entered and it was abit cringey. Then it was ok until the witches enter the hotel. They're all bright and not scary, ok fine. But then shes holding an adult cat, and not that it's really relevant but if you have ever tried holding a sizable cat on one arm, it doesnt come off like it does in the film, but hey, I digress. The meeting in the hall has hardly any witches, you expect at least double. Anne Hathaway was the wrong choice. Her acting is laughable and not scary, her accent... she sounds Norwegian, scottish and Russian rather than German. Shes overacting, but not in an Angelica Houston scary way, in a sad as if meant to be funny way. When the witches take off their shoes you can basically see the toes they supposedly dont have, thay was kinda lazy. She floats all cringey, she doesnt look scary, but like a pretty clown(?) The cgi is sad, not scary. When she says witches, she sounds like shes saying b***hes. The mice make you forget your supposed to be scared, they make you think you're watching stuart little or something. I got abit bored after that, but wanted to see how it ended. Stanley tucci should have been in it more. Needed better witches. Needed better effects or cgi. Meh, may turn it off before then end...
Ps. Watched abit further on and it continues to be cringey. Her accent continues to be bad. But she mentions she has ""selective food disorder"" and calls it picky eaters. This is slightly offensive to those with this eating disorder, that is real. The struggle is real. So I continued to watch despite my instinct to turn it off. The witches turn into crazed rats by doing a weird bang poof on the ceiling, yawn and just prior ann Hathaway reveals herself to be a witch by doing magic in the dining room by moving a table out of the way and no one seems to notice. Then she reveals herself to the grandma and I think, why cos they pretend not to be witches. But hey. Anne Hathaway's acting and accent continue to be embarrassing. Regretting giving it 5 now, maybe 4 or 3 would be more appropriate. Not loving the ""humour"" and I might have a kip.",The Witches

It COULD HAVE, it not for Anne Hathaway's bizarrely terrible performance. I don't know if it was down to the direction or her own choice, but she comes off like Johnny Depp doing a Nicolas Cage impression and it's just really off-putting. And her accent is like Scottish mixed with some eastern European languages and comically over-exaggerated. The performance is neither scary nor funny(not even in a so good it's bad way), it's just weird, and all the CGI effects don't help. Individually Hathaway and Zemeckis are capable of making good movies, so I really don't know what happened here.",The Witches

I really didn't enjoy the ending as even though there was some sadness in the original, at least it afforded the grandson and the other kids a happier ending.

It's also been very clear for a number of years now that Anne's forte are not accents. I mean she sounded comical and even Scottish in certain parts...like girl come on now.

151,Spellbound88,At this point I'm being too generous with the rating..,3,1 November 2020,"Surprised to see so many people having the same exact thoughts here. The original Witches (1990) was a fantastic movie, wholesome, magical, soulful, and most importantly - terrifying. What the heck did I just watch? What is this? Robert Zemeckis and Guillermo del Toro destroyed this movie. It's a comical mockery aimed to tick all the diversity boxes for thirsty progressives. Is this a witch hunt or a hunt on white people? 🤔 Other than than Anne Hathaway is the most ridiculous case of miscasting I've seen in the last 7 years probably. Who came up with that genius idea? Not only does she overact and try too hard, but she should seriously never try emulating accents ever again. The entire cast failed to engage, everybody is soulless disinterested, even the lead child is just going through the motions. The CGI is pathetic and comical, and pretty much nothing comes close to the original movie. What were they thinking giving the witches those ridiculous appendages that made them look as if they were constantly giving people ""the finger""? That's just one thing, let alone everything else. It was comical, pathetic and made a mockery out of itself. The original instilled a genuine fear in me as a child, while the remake is probably a wet dream for liberals",The Witches

155,Dory_Darko,Well... I thought it was fun!,8,6 December 2020,"This movie seems to be getting a lot of hate, which is mostly a sign of the times we live in.. Any 13-year-old can write a tweet and call it a review without putting any effort into it. Whatever - another discussion, another day.I saw this movie at a theatre - uniquely, in the middle of a pandemic. I've been cooped up in my house since March, and when I saw that my local theatre was hosting limited viewings, I took a chance. Thankfully there were only two other people there. Anyway...!I had a good time! I immediately loved the new setting of the story, Alabama. And yes, I definitely appreciated the renewed diversity of the characters. Rather than going too much into the story, I'll focus on the technical aspects. Actors first. Anne Hathaway is a riot! Deliberately overacting every scene, she just beams with wicked joy in playing such an evil character. She chews the scenery as if it's an all-you-can-eat buffet, and her glee is infectious. What struck me most about her performance though, was the way she utilised her voice. I'm not sure if it was digitally enhanced in some parts, but in any case, her range, depth and boisterousness were very impressive. And yes, her accent was ridiculous... But to me, somehow it just added to her otherworldly nature, because the fact that her accent didn't belong to any particular Earthly country, only emphasised her demonic identity. Octavia Spencer is lovely as always, faithfully executing her part as a kick-ass grandma. She, too, is joyful and captivating. Stanley Tucci is always a hoot. Even though he doesn't have that much screentime, it's obvious he still had fun with that leering Cajun accent and that typical hotel manager moustache. I would recommend this movie for the actors alone.Now, as far as comparing this remake to the 1990 original or the book, I'm afraid I can't be of much help. I've never read the book and it's been so long since I've seen the one with Angelica Huston, all I can remember is that I was absolutely terrified as a child. Although I'm pretty sure that's exactly the point of The Witches - it's basically kiddie horror. Now, I personally can't really think of any reason why any children's book writer would deliberately want to give children nightmares, but it seems to be pretty normal for some reason.. On that note, the other two people in the theatre with me, were actually little kids, no more than 7 or 8 years old. Unaccompanied. Now, call me old-fashioned, but there are some visuals in this movie which are truly disturbing. I will even admit that I had kind of a hard time not being a little bit freaked out myself. Now, far be it from me to tell anyone how to live their life, it's just that... I don't know. I find it difficult to understand why the line between what's really kid's stuff, and what is not, should be so blurred. Why frightening, mentally unhealthy even, imagery needs to be so normalised to the point where our children are basically watching horror movies. Hell, why not just stick 'm in front of the tv and put The Exorcist on. Oh, that's different? I'm overreacting? Explain to me what exactly the difference is. A funny talking mouse really doesn't change anything.Oh well, here I am talking into a void again...One last note I guess. For the most part, this movie is very visually pleasing. The costumes are a treat and the scenery is very well visualised. The CGI is mostly good, although the cat is seriously unconvincing. They definitely could've spent a few more hours rendering its movements, or better yet, they could have just as easily trained and used a real cat. For most of the shots at least, just like they used a real mouse in the beginning, which was changed to CGI as soon as it started talking..So. Definitely fun, and definitely scary. Also, should I be at all concerned that this review which I am writing right now, is the 666th user review for this title...? Freaky stuff..",The Witches

It excludes all of the European characteristics, features some of the worst acting I've ever seen (and I've seen snakes on a plane).

So, there's Ms. Spencer and then, to my delight, came Chris Rock and Anne Hathaway. I thought all that's good with the film would be over with the acknowledgement of their presence in the film, only for me to realize my foolishness the moment the story began to unfold. Needless to say, I was hook by the story's creativity, the characters' makeup, and the humor or sweetness of each line. This gets me to thinking that, perhaps, only children, and those adults who can tap into their childhood, should be able to rate and write a review for movies that were made for children. My goodness! The overall rating of this film doesn't fit. This film was entertaining and enjoyable.

This new version takes away a lot of the raw, grounded horror of that version and embraces the whimsical, almost turning the film into a wacky comedy.

163,cockadoody73,Very enjoyable. Ignore the outraged middle aged fans of the original.,6,26 October 2020,"It's pretty sad to see a bunch of adults getting so bent out of shape at a film aimed at children. I have seen so many comments on horror groups from outraged men and women who think 'true horror fans' will hate this movie. They need to grow up.
We know that the original was great, get over it. Kids will love this, they'll also love the original. Shut up and let people enjoy things.Ok so onto the movie.
The story has moved to 1960s Alabama. Little Hero loses his parents in a car crash, and his Grandma comes to take him into her home. Not ashamed to say that the first 15 minutes really moved me, actually had a lump in my throat. Grandma singing ""Reach Out, I'll Be There"" to a clearly traumatised little boy is genuinely upsetting.
The story hasn't changed much. The Witches are holding their annual meeting at a posh hotel (where Hero and Grandma are hiding after they encounter a witch near their home) under the guise of a conference for a child protection group.
The action is very slapstick, the mice are very cute, the acting is great and the story is pretty heartwarming.
I was slightly put off by the fact that Anne Hathaway was playing the Grand High Witch because I've never been a fan, but she was great - although her accent jumps around quite a bit.
Octavia Spencer is one of my favourite actresses, so there was no question of me not watching this movie. She is excellent in it, just the right mixture of stern Grandma and loving Grandma.
The children are excellent too.Your kids will love it, the whining adults who need to grow up and let people make up their own minds need to stop living in the past. This movie does not erase the original. If you don't like how it looks just don't watch it.

Being a great fan of old school Hollywood use of puppets and animatronics, I really didn't like the use of CGI in this remake. The movie does have some moments and it has an ending closer to that of the novel. Beyond that, the CGI really kills this movie. I much prefer the Jim Henson crew with their puppets any day for live characters. CGI is better put to use on inorganic subjects, such as spaceships or other inanimate objects.I don't think anyone did a poor job of acting, I don't mind the relocation, I am not going to say it was the worst movie adaptation either.

167,dperky,"Silly, But Entertaining",6,11 November 2020,"A new adaptation of Dahl's The Witches has hit HBO Max and it's a bit of mixed bag. While some of the effects are charmingly whimsical, the tone is often too silly to conjure up any legitimate threat.In the 60's, a little boy is orphaned after a deadly car crash and is sent to live with his eccentric grandmother in Alabama. Almost immediately, he finds himself preyed upon by evil witches who look almost exactly like regular women except for their strange hands, feet, the scar across their mouth, and the fact that they're always wearing wigs or turbans to cover up their baldness.He and his grandmother escape to a swanky coastal hotel only to discover it's crawling with witches who are in town for their annual meeting. When the little boy gets too close, they turn him into a mouse and he and his grandmother must find a way to stop the witches before all the children in the world suffer the same fate.The Witches appears to be trying to give us some political message, but it's a little too muddy to be totally effective. Are the witches fantastical versions of racists, nazis, and all other sorts of bigots? Is it saying that it's our duty to rally the troops to fight again them? Maybe, but it's all too silly to take seriously. With every smart move like this, the filmmakers usually fudge something immediately after, canceling any goodwill out. Octavia Spencer anchors the film with her performance as the grandmother and Anne Hathway appears to be having the time of the life chewing the scenery as the evil Grand High Witch.",The Witches
168,colinschmaltz,Nothing will ever compare to the original,3,4 February 2021,What can I say the original is a classic with amazing makeup a good story and the creepy vibe that Roald Dahl was famous for. I've seen worse adaptations but this one is just a plain old run of the mill remake kids can get a kick out of it and even the parents might see it as a fun adventure but it's no classic,The Witches

170,beschuitfluiter,Unnecessary,3,30 October 2020,"Unnecessary in all ways. Too much cgi at every corner. The build is not as exciting as the original. The whole woke sauce is too obvious. Then there's the over acting to compensate it all. Nope, doesn't work.",The Witches
171,treborquest,Anne Hathaway is not the only one killing this movie,3,28 October 2020,"The Grand High Witch is killing it. but seriously, she's terrible.
From the start on, with the weird Chris Rock voice-over, this remake goes wrong wherever it can wrong. The acting is stiff, the focus is hardly on all the other witches, the CGI is not good. Even the housekeeping cart seems to come from the CGI box. Positive thing: Octavia Spencer is doing her best to be a genuine grandmother, and she succeeds, but that's about it.
OK, yes, I am a fan of the 1990 movie. Even though it wasn't as close to the original story, I really can't believe Roald Dahl would recognize his book in this mess. The first movie was gorgeous in it's authenticity. It has folklore, it has an edge, it has a heart. This is Hollywood factory work and seems to want to be much more than it can deliver. It made me miss much more than the purple glow in the witches eyes. It made me want to just throw up like a witch who smells children.
I'm not saying you shouldn't watch it. I am sure that an entire generation who never grew up with the original will disagree, but to me, this is like cursing in a church. It's horrible.",The Witches

Having come to this without having read the book (another cause for the mindless) nor seen the previous version of the film I thoroughly enjoyed it.

175,GeorgeTinNYC,People Need to Be Smarter,9,23 October 2020,"Why do I say ""people need to be a little smarter""?.... because it is a remake by Robert Zemeckis. I LOVE Robert Zemeckis (we share a birthday and he's a great storyteller fun fact, also sharing a birthday with George Lucas). There was nothing wrong with the original, however technology gives you a little more room to play with the execution of the storytelling. None the less, a lot of the 1 star ratings were simply because the leads were black? Seriously, it was compared over 4 times to a 'what if' a historically black film was revised with an all white cast. Which is extremely demonstrative of their ignorance because that has already been done with a lot of literature and black characters. As well as people stating this is a ""political"" remake, when no one really thinks that until you factor in their own insecurities of having minorities in leading roles. Anyway, I don't love Anne Hathaway... her acting was a little much, but that may have been how the director wanted it played. No one can really recreate that Anjelica Houston portrayal but she does it in her own way which is what an actress is supposed to do. It's just a bit distracting from the story. Overall a great FAMILY film. One person did say ""it wasn't as scary as I remembered it as a kid"". Which I agree with, but you may not realize that fear as an adult. Seeing those feet, mouths and claws may be more of an impact for a child, or it may have purposefully been made kid friendlier. Because I was 4ish when the original came out and I couldn't sit through it I remember being terrified. that also may be the difference between CGI and practical effects. Still a great watch, people who rated it poorly where looking for an updated remake without it being ""updated"". It's not a transformer movie it's a Roald Dahl adaption. I and a lot of people can feel apart of the story now with a lead character portrayed by people of color.",The Witches

Then please leave the room now...OK kids, now that the adults have left the room...This is a great, really fun movie... It has lots of very evil witches who want to turn all of the children in the world into mice and then squish them... It has a bunch of stuffy grown-ups who can't do anything to help... It has three brave kids who even after they get turned into mice still battle against the evil witches to save all the children in the world...
Oh... It also has the fantastic actress from The help (a movie you never saw) playing the brave grandma... Anne Hathaway from Les Misérables (another movie you never saw) playing a campier version than Anjelica Houston... and Stanley Tucci from Big Night (yet another movie you never saw) playing the stuffy hotel manager who doesn't like mice...

But this movie is not all bad as it may seem. The main, and most enjoyable part of this movie was Anne Hathaway. She played the head which perfectly. I have never seen her do a project that involved so much screaming and had that much visual effects for her. To me I think she deserves another ask her for her role. Same with Octavia Spencer.

First I was like that's interesting because whoever was gonna make it had big shoes to fill. Then Anne Hathaway was casted as ""The Grand High Witch"", was a perfect match. Couple weeks later Octavia Spencer and Stanley Tucci were added as well and I was all on board! Since COVID19 cancelled theaters to release films regularly, Warner Bros and HBOMax worked together to release it streaming on only HBOMax this October.Now the original 1990 film is and always will be iconic for Angelica Hustons' performance as ""The Grand High Witch"" is unlike anything. Anne Hathaway sold that role in a different way and it worked! As well as everyone else in the cast are all really good. There are certain aspects closer to the book and some different. Book had claws for fingers and nostrils and toes and the grand high witch being pretty but has a mask to cover her face. This version had everything that the book had expect her scary face was an elongated mouth and only came out when she was furious. I loved this touch and some won't at all. I will always be a fan of the 1990 version being so advanced with prosthetic puppets and makeup can appreciate its originality! As a whole I loved this re-imagined version by the iconic Robert Zemeckis and produced by Guillermo del Toro they did a great job. Some aspects are closer to the novel and minor changes, don't go in expecting the original. Go with an open mind. Do not listen to the negative reviews I didn't understand.

215,seannasuti,To help contrast with all those negative reviews on this site. ;),7,3 November 2020,"Roald Dahl's 1983 novel 'The Witches' was one of many hits from the highly-acclaimed author's prestigious bibliography and was brought to life on the big-screen in 1990 thanks in large part to producer Jim Henson. Dahl, however, was rather critical towards the film (as he was admittedly known to do when it came to adaptations of his work) for its radically different ending. Nevertheless, the film was a huge success with critics and while it may not have been much of a box-office hit, it has very much become a cult classic of its time. As such, it's not too surprising that the 1990 film's legacy has had a major impact on the reactions towards this year's new adaptation of the novel, directed by Robert Zemeckis and produced by Guillermo Del Toro and Alfonso Cuaron. But while most of the user reviews on this site are venomously decrying this as a complete and utter disaster, it's not 'that' bad.To be fair, though, I'm not saying that it's perfect as it's arguably the most by-the-numbers film that Zemeckis has ever directed. Just like what happened when Tim Burton directed his remake of 'Planet of the Apes' in 2001, this is one of those films where, if you didn't know that it was directed by the same guy behind 'Back to the Future' and 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', you probably wouldn't have guessed since it's one of those films that could've easily been done by anyone. Still, for what it's worth, the film does a nice job of maintaining the whimsical nature of Roald Dahl's writing where the kids are the heroes in a story that's full of the delightfully twisted dark sense of humor that Dahl was well-known for. And while it's completely understandable if some may find her performance to be a bit too over-the-top, Anne Hathaway is clearly having a lot of fun in the lead role of the story's main antagonist, the Grand High Witch.Now as a quick disclaimer, while I have read the book, I'll admit that I've never watched the 1990 film because, simply put, it never ended up on my radar when I was growing up. As such, I don't have the strong connection to it that other folks have, thus influencing their thoughts on this new film. And becuase of this, I found this new version of 'The Witches' to be generally solid overall. While it's far from being the best film that Robert Zemeckis has ever directed, it's ultimately a harmless family-friendly flick that helps bring one of Dahl's most famous stories to a new generation.",The Witches

The cast was great and the make up was just so memorable, along with the setting and the Norwegian background. This remake is definitely worth a watch, but you have to go into watching it knowing you are going to get an altered story. I would've enjoyed the film to be a bit more dark and eerie, as the original was. This one adds more humor and the CGI can get a bit annoying. Can we get some make up artists back in the mix? CGI still makes everything look generic and less realistic. I enjoyed Anne Hathaway surprisingly. I'm sad that we didn't get the opening with the girl stuck in the painting as that always stuck with me as a child. And the ending was different which was partially upsetting to me as well, although it was a cute new ending. Watch it. It's fun and exciting. I wouldn't mind someone else re doing the film down the road and making it more adult.",The Witches

But to be fair this movie is not as bad as some of the extremely negative reviews have made out! The cast is pretty good, Octavia Spencer plays the dutiful grandma very well and kudos to Jahzir Bruno as the young protagonist who plays the part excellently and is believable as the grief stricken young boy who has just lost his parents. Anne Hathaway hams it up as the Grand High Witch, but in a good way and she has some menacing moments. The SFX are quite a let down and are not up to scratch.

Octavia Spencer was so over the top camp , Chris rocks voice over was overly excited considering he is narrating a story that is about evil withches and the danger they pose towards children ..The whole film was so badly miscast it makes showgirls look like pride and prejudice, Hollywood u have to stop now remaking classic movies , come up with some new ideas and make new movies diverse. We do not need to erase iconic movies from the past just to tick the diversity quota , make new movies new ideas and just be diverse ....Anne Hathaway really should be kept away from icnonc roles like this.

The CGI at times is frustrating and some scenes do not make any sense what so ever.Let the kids watch this....

I usually don't like remakes.Anne Hathaway and Octavian Spencer are amazing actresses per their usual. Hathaway's over the top accent was in character so I don't know why people hate it soo much in the reviews. I didn't really like the Chris Rock voice over. I think a more mature characters voice would've made it more more fairytale like. Chris Rock translates to humor in my mind. The CGI is fun.

Annoying narration too.,1,27 October 2020,"There are so many 'not thought out' things in this movie; a lot is just amateurish. The script is good for, maybe, a developing mind around 6 or 7 years old. I didn't like the narration either, a proper speaking young boy and a narration 'as if it was him when older' changes from a well spoken child to this 'older him' voice completely different than how he sounds adding useless information you would already assume, know or find out or just completely without purpose. Poor poor plot. It is more like a Halloween semi-spooky child's book of about 20 pages or so. Was not made to entertain adults at all unless you have very low expectations and are just bored enough to watch anything.
The boy had a bad script but still did well with what he had. The original blows this away and ruins this movie just in comparison.
As Snoopy says, 'BLEH'.
Also, with it being so child-like it was really inconsistent in that they emphasized Anne's breasts and made it pretty disgusting in the looks that were scary.",The Witches

The 1st 3rd is kinda slow. To long scenes on the boy and grandma. Expositions? establishing the relationship? maybe.
Then the scene at the hotel is when it starts to have some action but still we have to droll on in most scenes. The unmasking could be more dramatic. The boy could be more clever. It would be great if they added more backstory on the characters especially grandma and Mary. Maybe not.

I loved the kid, he did the best, but not for too long. Chris Rock's voice was so annoying, it made the whole plot sound ridiculous. My expectations were much higher when I saw Anne Hathaway is going to be the Grand Witch. Her acting was okay, the makeup was just stupid. Why did the witches have to be so fashionable I don't understand. Concerning the witches, they barely had a say during the entire movie. The CGI was unbelievably poor.

It's a new take on the 1990 one and I hate to say this, but the 1990 one is inferior it only did better in the practical effects department. The 2020 version does everything better from describing in detail, casting, acting and has a well respected director (Robert Zemeckis, Back to the Future).

It played to the strengths of the original movie but the delivery was weak. I'm not judging the child actors because their roles were simple and convincing enough (and children shouldn't be scrutinized, either way) but Anne Hathaway (whom I love and adore) had big shoes to fill following Angelica Houston and perhaps it would've been better if she made the character more her own. However, she was still pleasant to watch especially in scenes with Stanley Tucci. Octavia Spencer was fine as well, but again, it was all just a bit too simple and a bit of a try hard at times.

255,kalavic,So insulting and pointless,2,3 November 2020,"How on earth does it make sense to, in the name of being inclusive to minorities, adapt a book written by a Norwegian-English author that revolves around the land of his heritage, and completely Americanize every aspect of it! To me this screams blind ethnocentrism. Now, I think it could be justified if there was a point, like in order to stick to the spirit of the original that may be lost otherwise. But this isn't the case.As with so many of the introduced elements to this adaptation, there is no real point at all. I won't give spoilers, but time and again, a new character or ability is introduced. You start thinking to yourself, ""I wonder how this is going to be used in the story to create new conflict, build tension, add depth, or set up a more epic confrontation."" Each time, you are let down. As soon as something new is introduced, it is promptly forgotten, and the result is that this wasted time and distraction waters down the original story. Tense, climactic moments are simplified and hurried through in the most pedestrian way possible. Both the book and the 1990 film were so much better in terms of storytelling.They also introduced plot holes so big that they confused my children on more than one occasion. I am pretty forgiving when it comes to plot holes in children's stories, but it does get to a point where it's off-putting, like, ""They're just dumb kids, it doesn't matter.""The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because of one change I came to appreciate--the addition of the snake-like mouths for the witches. It does add to the feeling that the witches are inhuman creatures which is in line with the source material.The last issue, the one that makes it really hard to give even 2 stars, is how mind-numbingly lame the dialogue is. I'm not sure this is a direct quote, ""Those mean, nasty witches, are really mean, nasty and evil!"" but it's hard to keep track because there are probably 50 or so analogues. That and characters awkwardly stating the obvious to the viewer: ""Oh no, the mean, nasty witches just ***** and now they are trying to *****!"", when we have just seen ***** and *****, and there is no reason for the character to communicate this to another character.",The Witches

This movie takes the gist of the original story, changes the setting and then adds in fitting details and that shows.The story starts properly with the main character going through the trauma of losing his parents and bonding with his grandma and then learning about witches when the danger becomes real.This is a very natural way to start the story.The story then follows it's natural course of characters who have bonded...or not and uses the CGI of this time to show the witches in ways that was previously much harder to do.I didn't feel like the CGI was overdone compared to the original story.

I'm not going to bore everyone with attempting to act like a professional movie critic and talk about a load of technical things.The entire movie is made out of CGI. Poor character models, ridiculous looking animals, fake EVERYTHING. Literally, everything was fake. And it looked it too. I've seen better CGI in 80s and 90s movies and YouTube fan films. I mean, what's wrong with dressing people up and playing the part and actually looking real? Why computerise everything and make it look cartoony as hell.Anne Hathaway did a decent job, her accent was weird but her acting was pretty darn good and scared the hell out of my young siblings but her characters' design was ridiculously fake, silly and ultimately, flawed. Hathaway and the brilliant Octavia Spencer did a good job acting wise but it wasn't enough to save this film.The original had heart, soul and genuine magic that drew people in.

283,ivyvine87,Just bad...,1,8 June 2021,"I love Olivia Spencer and really wanted to give this one a fighting chance but they totally messed this remake up. I for one would've done a prequel about the original grandma in Norway and how she discovered all she knew about the witches and tie in origin story of the grand high witch too - casting was not thought out as Anne Hathaways accent issues are so distracting that you can't even get past it, the daisy mouse is voiced by a middle aged lady but supposed to be a child?, and the changes they made about the witches and how you can tell which ladies are one just took more away from what made the original so great. How can they change the Erica going into a painting changed to a girl being turned into a chicken? Wtf was that? The original storyline was so much better so Idk what they were thinking - this was a huge missed opportunity to make something that added to the story not completely missed the mark. Also where was the assistant who saved the day at the end? Don't believe me?

1. Octavia Spencer. Hilarious. Just hilarious.
2. Kirsten Chenoweth adds a certain Southern charm and in my humble opinion, a welcome addition to the cast of characters.
3. Chris Rock as the narrator. He normally gets on my nerves a tiny bit but I thought he was perfect in it.
4. Stanley Tucci can do no wrong in my eyes. Even when his willy is being bitten by a rat.Ok, now let's address the glaringly obvious flaws of this film...
1. Anne Hathaway. No she was never going to measure up to Angelica Houston but to fall this short is a travesty. Her accent is absolutely disastrous and that's not the worst of it. She TOTALLY overacted and brought absolutely NO class to the role of the Grand High Witch.
2. The CGI. What the hell were they thinking?! Again, totally overdone and unnecessary. Surely they could have got a trained cat for goodness sake.Overall, I thought it was enjoyable. I enjoyed the first one for different reasons. But I still enjoyed it.",The Witches

This is a fun family film, with some horrible CGI, but it's made for teens and children, but adults seem to like critique it like they are all in the cannes film festival panel.Octavia Spencer is the stand out performer here. Absolutely brilliant actress. Chris rocks narration is a welcome and strangely comforting addition.No spoilers here, please ignore the future wishing Oscar winners.

Hardly ever sits through movies but she sat through the whole of this and thoroughly enjoyed it. She laughed throughout and found the grand high witch very scary.I personally found the movie to be watchable and it wasn't bad at all, the effects were very good and I liked Anne Hathaway's performance. I did however feel the movie lacked the depth of the original. They changed a lot of the original storyline which made it hard to connect with the characters and not to mention they didn't include a certain character that I feel was central to the original in adding a nice twist to the story, mainly at the end (if you've seen it and then watch this you will know who I'm talking about). I didn't feel any macabre and eerie aspects to this film and missed the story about the girl in the picture from the original movie. I hated the ending.I found that there were too many comedic elements to the movie instead of good character development and I would have given it 5 stars for effort, however my daughter just loved it and at the end of the day these kind of movies are more tailored to children so, although far from perfect, it's certainly one that little ones will enjoy around Halloween. Angelica Houston will always be the grand high witch to me but maybe watch this with an open mind with the kiddies and try not to take it too seriously. It's not a bad movie.",The Witches

298,entertheratking,Not a remake of the movie.,4,1 November 2020,"It amazes me how many people in these reviews think this is a remake of the original movie. The original was based on a book. This is based on a book. This is a movie adaptation of a book, not a remake of a movie. And the original, as great as it was, is also not particularly faithful either. Regardless, comparing differences between this and the original movie is pointless and, in my opinion, stupid.That said...The movie is still mediocre at best. It's also not a particularly good adaptation of the book. Nor is it a good remake of the original movie. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever seen, a lot of the people giving it 1's are clearly just salty and have no idea what a 1/10 movie is really like and are stuck on the original (I suggest Birdemic for a 1/10 movie), but I don't see myself recommending this to anyone any time soon either.The fact is, it's not a good book adaptation, the original movie is both more captivating in the way the plot unfolds, the puppets are in my opinion far scarier than the CGI, and while the actors were all pretty good for the most part, I'm sorry but they just can't compare to the original's who were almost born to play those roles.And To be clear I could care less about them casting black actors. I'm not at all opposed to this. But I'm sorry, Chris Rock was not a good choice for narrator. Especially if you are a grown up who grew up with the real Chris Rock. It just doesn't work. There were much better choices for this movie. It seems SO forced. Like Will Smith singing Arabian Nights.Disappointing to say the least but for a cheesy one time Halloween flick for people who love Halloween movies I guess there's worse out there...",The Witches
299,Loichtfoier,Poor imitation of a small work of art,4,18 May 2021,"Trivial rip-off of the grandiose film from 1990. The new version relies primarily on visual effects, rather than essential quality. Of course, the actors are already convincing, but it was no coincidence in 1990 to give the role of Mr. Stringer, the manager of the hotel, to Rowan Atkinson, for example. The other supporting actors also brilliantly transported the main story at the time.It would have made more sense to tell a completely new story than to rip snippets from the old one and remake it. Those who don't know the original film won't and will no doubt be entertained here. Those who were excited by the film at the time will see a small work of art destroyed here.

Unfortunately as is the norm these days CG is used at the drop of a hat (or wig) because its simply the easier option. Remember the terrifying grand high witch transformation from the original film? now its a question of forget prosthetics or excellent makeup, or even excellent acting actually. You wont find it here!The CG snake was needless and looked awful, hire a real snake or use one of the crew members' pet snake, cheaper, easier and realistic. SIMPLE!The most irritating thing about this movie from the beginning is that it lacks any subtlety at all, which unfortunately makes it all completely unbelievable. If witches were obvious-and every single witch in this movie parades around with the subtlety of Donald Trump-then they would be easy to spot. Sometimes less is more, what you dont see can be infinitely more horrifying.The above bits are the least of this movie's problems. Now I am mixed race and love a cultural nod as much as the next person but again a little subtlety would be nice, yes the main characters are black and no problem with that at all in fact I welcome the change, however I dont need to be given a stereotypical view of a black family, We dont all like motown, we dont all like southern style food, i mean what was with that room service scene!?!?!? All it was missing was a sign saying Stereotypical Southern Black Woman's Order' , Please get away from this one size fits all model because its old and tired.Movie is set in the US, why? What was the point of doing that? Story is unchanged regardless of where it takes place but what difference did changing the setting to the US actually make? Other than filming it in America because it was convenient I cant think of any other reason for this.The actingOctavia Spencer is great I love the lady but shes the only good thing here.
Stanley Tucci plays the same character he plays in everything, the quirky one, it works for him and thats fine.
The kids are terrible and very irritating, at least the kids in the original had some likeability.
Anne Hathaway is awful, bad accent, hammy and just a farce overall. Very much a paint by numbers portrayal of the bad guy, cliché, robotic, silly really and not in a good way.I touched on it earlier but why is EVERYTHING CG!?!?
The terrible mouth of the Grand High Witch, the terrible CG mice, The transformations were pathetic and we had a CG wooden log!!!I ask you WHY!?Skip this Hammy dumpster fire",The Witches

My family thought it would be a good idea to watch the 1990 one day and watch the other tomorrow and I just loved the 1990 version it is a classic but when we started this version.... well let's just say I was ready to gouge my eyes out. And to think that such great actors and actresses like Anne Hathaway and Octivia Spencer were in such a train wreck of a movie. My first complaint is that this movie uses an overly amount of CGI where it's to the point where it makes the Green Lantern movie look like Avatar. My second complaint is that it they didn't have the setting anywhere near England, seriously the book and original movie take place in Norway and another place I can't remember, not in Chicago. My final complaint is the acting, even though Anne Hathaway wasn't terrible it was still a little over the top with the accent and all, and Octavia Spencer's character is basically a rip-off of her character in The Help.
In conclusion, the people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves and apologize profusely for this movie. The only good thing I can say about this movie is Chris Rock's narration which gave me a chuckle and that they put that one scene where Luke puts the potion in the soup.",The Witches

311,Ghostofthewoods,Another Poor Remake....,1,18 May 2021,"I think this was more about ticking politically correct boxes rather than making a rendition of 'The Witches'. It has no 'organic' feel to it at all! It's as if the director/producer has created a tick sheet with a list of what the film needs to have/show from the original, rather than follow a classic story.

This film is the reason I generally don't watch modern remakes of good films but my girlfriend made me so.... There's just no need for it and no need to 'bring it up to date'.
There's none of the eeriness of the original, none of the like-ability in the lead characters. The two stars are for the lead child and stanly tucci.
No humour whatsoever so far but the easy 'fat kid' jibes to keep kids entertained.
Anne Hathaways lead witch visually just reminded me of Mars attacks and the accent was and is too much even though it's meant to be.
Just a lot of bland CGI none sense. Having said that I'm sure there are loads of 10 year olds that have enjoyed it.

313,raifuzz,Fantastic family entertainer!,9,29 August 2021,This is an entertaining piece of family movie in otherwise comic book adaptation and movies for adults.I have to give it to Anne Hathaway for wonderfully portraying the Grand High Witch. My kids were really glued to her. Octavia Spencer comes across as a lovely grandmother saddled with a sad experience from her childhood. The kids/mouse does wonderful job and carried the story along nicely.This is one wholesome movie that takes me back to Home Alone era where good family movie is focused on the kids as the main characters yet the supporting casts are good too.Would love this kinda movie to be made more.,The Witches
314,sandralfagundes,Anne Hathaway was great! The movie itself was boring.,6,11 March 2021,"I don't know why Anne Hathaway's portrayal of the grand high witch was criticized. She was scary and believable; she held her own. I think she could have benefited from an accent couch maybe. I remember a critic stating that she kept jumping from Russian to polish to...or something like that. I couldn't stop noticing it. Then again, this is make believe....does it really matter. Anyway, I felt like the whole movie was Anne Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, Octavia Spencer and the grandson. The others witches had no personality: they were just a flock of sheep following the grand high witch. In the old one, many witches and side characters had memorable expressions, moments, personalities. Even Bruno is dull. 3 excellent actors do not make a movie. When the grand high witch kills the ""insubordinate"" witch, it takes all but 3 seconds. In the old movie, she begged and pleaded. She had a pulse. All this money on great talent, set, costumes and CGI but if story isn't good, you ain't got much.

We then almost immediately see them at the exact hotel she chooses to go to in order to avoid witches because 'it's full of rich white people' and the first child the Witches turn into a mouse is a rich white child!It's scary and confusing for children and completely naff for adults. It's lost all the charm of the book, has ostracized people with disabilities and decided to bring class and race into the picture without any context and then in schizophrenic fashion turns that on its head anyway!I can't find anything redeeming about it.

Ms. Hathaway does well but it hard to shake the memories of Anjelica Huston. Big fan of Octavia Spencer and was glad she was in the movie.

In my opinion they over used CGI and the storyline was bland, what wrong with using Prosthetics like in the original. The story leaves you unfulfilled and not wanting more. Like many of the remake during the last few years it leaves a Sour taste in your mouth and you asking the question why?. Will these film producers instead of only think about making a quick buck, decide to make something new and with integrity, Their is plenty of source material, books, et.

It was good up until Anne Hathaway opened her mouth with an experimental accent. Which is sad, because I love her in everything else she has done.

344,crowtower,Honestly don't understand the hate,10,1 November 2020,"I LOVED this movie from start to finish! Absolutely don't understand why people didn't like it. It's a wonderful, whimsical movie for kids and adults alike.
It's not the 90s version and that's a good thing. It's a different version and both were excellent.
Octavia Spencer was incredibly loveable as the grandma character and I enjoyed that her character and her grandson were black - it gave a new perspective on the story.
Anne Hathaway clearly relished her role and gave a campy, intense performance. Omg those toes! Haha!
The set design and cinematography were also excellent.
I'm also glad they had the balls to commit to the events that took place - don't want to spoil the movie, but you'll understand when you watch it.
Please give this a chance and make up your own mind about this one.

It had its flaws, but as a huge fan of the original I admit they kept pretty close to the source material. Now I admit I haven't read the book so all i have to compare it to is the first film from the 90's. I absolutely loved how scary they made the witches look, but I wish they had more spooky screen time! However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed that they changed the ending so drastically. Aside from that, and Anne Hathaway's confusing accent, it was a good watch. Just don't expect to have all your questions answered.

The original was hilarious and the kids hound it highly amusing. Unfortunately this latest remake left us looking at each with the look, you know the one, the 'was that meant to funny' look and the film just felt sort of empty. I won't spoil it by going into plots but if you've seen the original, which I advise you do, you know the plot already. Yes some of the graphics are clever but it didn't feel so immersive as the original. Another example that simplicity with good setting and humour is all kids want.

The storyline was virtually the same as the original, in fact only one scene appeared to be different, however it didn't have any effect on the movie.Would it have been better with a cameo from Rowan Atkinson?

The CGI is pretty bad in some parts but what makes it unbearable is Anne Hathaway and her ridiculous accent for no reason whatsoever. I think she was trying too hard to outshine Angelica Houston.

Absolutely butchered a classic adding in topics have that no business in the remake of a kids movie that we're never there to begin with. The makers should be ashamed.

Casting was weak - even Olivia Spencer was trapped in a shallow humorless role. The tone of this film felt mean without the subtle humor of the original.

It's completely inoffensive and does everything it needs to with the charm of grandma, the malice of the Grand High Witch, etc. I'm getting the feeling that these are reactionary responses to yet another 'bland and unoriginal Hollywood' trend even though this is an adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, just like the 1990 version is.It's alright if people don't like this movie I suppose but acting like it's the worst thing to come to screens is an exaggeration to say the least. Kids are most definitely going to enjoy it, it is for them after all, not the adults comparing it to the 1990 adaptation, so I'd say this film was a success in what if wanted to do.",The Witches

Lemme just say I did not like Anne Hathaway in this role. She seemed like she was trying real hard I guess but it came off really tacky and the cgi did not do well in replacement of the practical effects. The mice were so hilarious and cute in the 90s version, and the grand high witch was perceived as something ancient, outer worldly and truely malevolent. You could tell that all the other witches feared and worshipped her.
In this, Anne Hathaway is more of rich snob if anything, and her accent is so all over the place it's hard to take seriously. I didn't understand the purpose of the big teeth either (if they don't actually use it eat children - what is point of it?) seemed like something that sounded creepy on paper but doesn't make much sense beyond that. I suppose the film is worth a shot if you like the story but it really pales in comparison to the 90s version that still holds up to this day believe it or not.",The Witches

375,laura843,Ignore the bad reviews,8,29 August 2021,The original is a classic but I didn't connect with the European Hansel & Gretal setting. The remake certainly revolutionises this by transferring things to Alabhama 1968 and focuses on a black grandma and her recently orphaned grandson discovering the witches coven. The duo are wonderfully played by Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno. Anne Hataway is great as the Grand High Witch yet is maybe a little too glam to be as terrifying as Angelica Houston BUT wait for the finale. 1990s horror principles may not go down as well in 2020 in a kids movie.

There is an original movie, with practical effects, a darker tone and not so good animatronics, but excellent makeup. Here... we have CGI. LOTS of CGI, and not very good at that. Chris Rock may be charrming, but sure is not a narrator. And the story goes off its rails to become more child and family friendly, when the original was more crepppy and for that, more memorable. The only thing memorable here is Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch, doing that funny accent.When you see that makeup and those practical effects back in 1990, you will never forget it.

By Quite Some Distance,3,8 March 2021,"I grew up loving the 1990 version, despite being absolutely terrified by Anjelica Huston as the Grand High Witch.I'm not the type of person to dismiss a remake before actually seeing it. But if you are going to remake a film you need to make it at least as good as the original, preferably better, though that doesn't happen very often. And it definitely didn't happen here!Now the location of the film has been moved from England to America, not the biggest issue in the world. The main characters are now black, again no issue at all... until the undertones of racism come into play. Jibes at ""rich white folk"" being the only people that normally stay at the hotel where the majority of the film takes places and the not-so-subtle racist comments by the white hotel manager. Was all that really necessary? I don't think so.Then we come to the Grand High Witch, Anne Hathaway have it a good go but was nowhere near as terrific or scary as Huston was. They were big boots to fill to be fair to her.The film scores it's points from me for fantastic cinematography, costumes and set decoration.

406,christinemalt,I remake I actually enjoyed!,8,28 October 2020,No Anne wasn't any Angelica but I really did enjoy this remake! The only thing that really grated on me was Anne's diabolical accent....I have no idea which country she was supposed to be mimicking (somewhere European?) but it was shocking! I really enjoyed it!

408,itz-mare,A perfectly fine movie.,7,19 November 2020,"Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. People clearly have too much time in their hands these days and decide to start criticizing a children's movie just because it's different from the remake they watched when they were younger.I found the movie was cute and entertaining. Good acting, nice story-line, decent visual effects and great costumes. Not as scary as the 1990 movie, so more suitable for children. It stayed true to the book while still adding some new aspects, such as the witches only preying on underprivileged, poor children who would not be missed. I also liked how there was more diversity than the 1990 movie.Sure, it has a few flaws. It was a risky move to Americanize the story, the accent of the Grand Witch is a odd and the witches don't have a lot of magic, but I wouldn't say any of these are a real deal-breaker. Just because this movie might not be as good as the 1990 remake, doesn't mean it's not worth watching.Just set aside your high expectations, keep in mind that it's a children's movie and you will enjoy this movie.",The Witches

The Witches was based on the Vardo Witches of Norway. In the book Grandma is Norwegian to tie the old superstitious tale together. The boy in the story is supposed to be British. The location should be the United Kingdom. Anne Hathaway was disastrous casting choice, she also had an unbearable multi 'European' accent (if you can call it that!). Chris Rock's narration is over the top and grating. Not everything needs to be Americanised to sell. I can't believe the line ""only rich white people can afford to come to this hotel"" was actually approved in a kids film - fuelling the fire for the next generation.

This adaptation has been produced a little more frilly around the edges and not as dark so a more younger audience can enjoy it without the more sinister overtones from the 1990 film, say, akin more to a child's imagination that they would have from reading the book!!Now that is out of the way!This is a fun romp, my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed it, the cgi was perfectly administered so it were more ""Stewart little"" and less ""Jurassic Park"" to highlight its childlike story telling. The plot, although differing from the book in settings was just as coincidental as it always has been and kept the fundamentals alive.Our only concern was maybe it could have been 20 minutes longer just to tie up the story better and make it more fluid and my daughter would have liked the very ending to be like the 1990s version, (She loves a happy happy ending!) but, it was well acted, mild threats kept light hearted and fun all round.Perfect for little ones and adults alike that enjoy a take on a kids classic and remember it is not an epic!",The Witches

However, I have to admit, Anne Hathaway, in my opinion, looked really spooky it was actually creepy to me, and I'm a huge horror movie fan and nothing really creeps me out. So I really enjoyed her performance. However, the ending was a little too cheesy for my taste, like, what happened to Bruno and Mary at the end?

Then, if you are gonna do it, well, do it well. They were clearly going for a kids friendly movie but I mean, this story is creepy. The mouse animation takes you away from it, specially coming from Henson's animatronics. The Great Witch reveal is underwhelming, and the changes/additions to the story don't serve it. It just doesn't adds up.It pains me that Cuaron and Del Toro are attached to this project as producers. Zemeckis seems to be going in decline and it just sucks.

467,EssMoreno,Overdramatised in every way to appeal to children,4,7 August 2021,"This film has a good base, the storyline is solid (all they needed to do was follow it) and the set and actors are great. I feel that there was a decision made, I assume by the director, to overdramatise the acting (to appeal to small children, who might find it funny) and because of this the child actors and adults alike aren't able to be their best selves as it's all too 'big' and in your face. The music is another thing that was just too much, they should have taken the example for he old film in that a nice subtle score with more subtle acting could still be dramatic and enjoyable, whereas this was not. Lastly, I liked the idea that witches could be in plain sight without you knowing, but this kind of steps on that idea as they all have this very specific look that would definitely stand out in a crowd.I rented this on google, and don't regret doing that because I would rather make my own mind up, but what I can say is that if you have smaller children they may enjoy this. That said, unlike an actually well done 'family' film, the adults who watch this, and dare I say even older teens will not enjoy this as they should.",The Witches

Chris Rock's voice over was extremely annoying and the Grand witch was just terrible.
You don't relate to the film like the original, in fact I don't think you really care for the characters at all with the way they have done the stupid voice over rather than let the young boy develop his own.
The only person I did like in the film was octavia but even her character was cold compared to how you would have liked her to be.

Well what's the point in remaking something for it to be identical - yes they also use a lot of CGI.. well again, what's the point in remaking something if you aren't going to utilise the technology of today. The movie seems a lot more to the tone of the original book simply because they could use special effects to really pantomime up the original story the way it was told. Is it the original?

""It's a she"", ""what's his name"" ""HER name is Daisy"" etc.To those championing the original, remember Roald Dahl wanted his name taken off of the credits because he didn't like the way it ended, it wasn't true to his tale, I find it exceptionally bad that his name and production company is stamped all over this film that changes the bits it does, while I can't speak for him, I very much doubt he would have wanted his name associated with this train wreck of a remake.It got 2 bits right.... but so much more wrong",The Witches
481,tuliakuu,Didn't have the same spark of magic as the original.,7,31 March 2021,"I'd like to preface my review with a point that I understand that many people these days are getting a bit tired of Hollywood remakes. It does feel like Hollywood has become a creatively bankrupt institution with no new fresh ideas to bring to the table. We are indeed in an era of remakes that has produced mixed results. However, I will be rating this movie largely on it's own merits, but I will need to compare it to the original movie as it's meant to be remaking the classic, and in fact borrows MUCH of it's content from the original.They made a few big changes which I felt were completely unnecessary. This is getting into spoiler territory so be aware.Remember the two little white mouse the main character had in the original? Well now instead of it being two mice, it's one mouse. And instead of it being just a regular mouse it becomes a new character, Daisy/Mary, a girl who was transformed into a mouse too! What are the odds! Why this girl mouse didn't open up right away is just sorta hand-waved away that she just didn't trust people. She doesn't add anything to the story, and in fact her role in the story was mostly just supportive for the main character. At the end of the film she doesn't have any meaningful conclusion. She is just there.Remember Bruno? In the original movie he was generally depicted as a food focused chubby kid, not a bad kid by any means...he just likes his sweets. In this movie he is given a slant of being a selfish ""greedy"" little worm.These two side characters just follow along with the main character, not really being of any real use. They just seem to be there to be supportive. A lost opportunity in my opinion.The ending was also weird to me. In the classic movie, Bruno's parents took him in because they still cared about him even though he was a mouse. In the new movie they completely rejected him and he ended up living with the main character and Daisy/Mary the mouse. Like..what? That seems unreasonable to me. Oh, you remember in the classic movie where the one good witch turned everyone back into humans. That doesn't happen here. The main character and his two sidekicks go on living life as a mouse. To have a future of going on to continue to fight against the witches. As a child this was honestly the ending I wanted. So I think...I think maybe someone who was writing the script must have felt the same way. So in this respect the movie actually did something different that I actually like. It is what it is.I will make a special note that I didn't feel the same sort of magic I felt when I watched the original film, but some of it was there. Sprinkled in at places, I still could feel that wonder I used to know if only in a small way. This to me was the most important part of the movie. Was that magic still there? It is, but it is like a star in the sky and not the moon itself. At least for me.. I felt they could have done more to recapture that feeling.In conclusion I want to say that although the movie itself was not the greatest this year, it wasn't as bad as other people seem to make it out to be. After all it was like 80% the same as the original. Is the movie a 10/10...heavens no. But is it a 1/10? Gosh no...and I feel people who vote either 10/10 or 1/10 aren't being fair to the movie. I know people want to voice their opinions, but overlooking the virtues of a film and focusing only on the negatives (and vice-versa) is far from an even-handed response. I know many people will disagree with this statement, as they feel this would send a message. What I would argue is maybe in doing so...they may be sending the wrong message. An interesting take on an old classic.",The Witches

Its fiction..a shame the press and social media jumped in to ruin its chances. There are far worse films that don't deserve making. I enjoyed it thoroughly.

The best thing about the original was the muppetry and use of prosthetics over CGI. Huston was great too. Also, the amount of men in drag in the ballroom scene is pretty great... but the story itself has plot holes for days. The grandma in both adaptations was a real G though. She stuck with her grandson and believed him through the whole thing. I think that was probably my favorite thing about both stories. I keep seeing these reviews that say ""no emotional connection"".. please. If you have no emotional connection to this kid, you didn't want to have one.The new version got rid of most of those plot holes. In particular it got rid of the painting people. If you remember the original had two different people in paintings. One was explained. The other wasn't. They also got rid of the cut off finger thing. I'm glad they stepped a little away from the ""fat kid trope"" in the new adaptation. I hated that about the original. Yes. Bruno is overweight. No the entire existence of this character doesn't need to revolve around him being overweight.The biggest change between the two is the ending. This ending left us all in shock. If you know anything about the original, you know that there was controversy about the ""good witch"" being thrown into it. That wasn't the original story. This new version plays closer to the book. Either way, enjoy it for what it is. It's a kid story that will scare kids a little and have them talking about it in 25 years as that creepy show they saw when they were kids with the bald witches who turned kids into mice.",The Witches

This is such a hollow, zero substance remake. In fact, it was so annoying to watch. I like Anne Hathaway but she did not do justice to this role. It's so over the top and came off more annoying than scary. Angelica Huston was so perfect in her portrayal that she didn't even need to speak and you'd get the chills from her stare. I think everything was just overly done but without any substance. Even the weaving choreography-like movements as the witches entered the grand room they were having their meeting was annoying! The other witches in this movie also seem like they were just there to fill the bodies of witches--even they didn't add any kind of color to the movie.

Octavia Spencer who plays the grandmother has a sassy sweetness with a strong and no nonsense disposition; The balance of her character with Anne Hathaway is is absolutely perfect.

On a positive note - Octavia Spencer's acting is brilliant, as expected, so is newcomer Jahzir Bruno's who is aptly named ""Hero Boy"" in this role. Although we don't actually see much of this as for most of it, Hero Boy is a mouse and ""Grandmother"" is elsewhere, You'll also be glad to know the Grand High Witch isn't named ""Baddie Woman""!
Onto the film itself, it feels like ninety percent of it is just CGI, and bad CGI at that! Whilst the villainous witches admittedly look like something straight out of a Tim Burton movie, the execution and convincers just aren't there.
Anne Hathaway puts on this strange, unknown, foreign accent with her dialogue and either leaves you wondering what on earth she is saying, or leaves you laughing with the absurdity of how she is saying it.

I like how they've changed the story-it wouldn't be interesting if they remade the film word-for-word, plot point for plot point. We have the classic film for that.I like how the race change affects aspects of the story, and I enjoy the acting overall. Grandma is my favourite.The CGI is lacklustre, but bearable, definitely not bad. I enjoy the cat, and Daisy. The witches are the weakest link. And the transformation scene...I've seen some complaints about Anne's accent in the film, and how it doesnt fit one nationality-I believe that is intentional, as the witches seem to be intended to mimic their familiars. The turban witch sounds like a snake, Anne sounds like a cat, etc. They aren't ""born"" anyway, being hatched, and live presumably long lives, so they likely wouldn't have to stick with just one accent.But...the ending...was horrendous. He just...stays a mouse. An old mouse, thats the narrator, older mouse him. He and his grandma make a witch hunting service, and he's talking about witches to a bunch of kids, telling them to go off and hunt witches too? Its wild. Definitely the lowest point.This is a solid movie, definitely watch the original too if you haven't, but this ones pretty nice in its own way, high 6/10",The Witches

530,thitiworadakran,The end of the story was very boring,3,28 February 2021,"""The Witches"". this movie is about witches and the story of this movie is slightly different from the typical witch stories that we know. Both in regards to hating children and not using their magic powers to trick children but it's the use of drugs to turn the children into animals and the witch in this story lives with regular people. They have physical characteristics that are different from normal humans, but they try to disguise themselves so they can look as human as possible.In the beginning of the movie, the opening was quite good. The CG of the witch's serpent is very good and looks very realistic. The plot about the witch is very mysterious. Including the plot of the main character, a boy who lost his parents on Christmas Day and his grandmother came to take care of him which was the opening of the movie and it shows that the main character is very lonely. From the beginning of the story that I just told you, it seems to be a good story.The behavior of the grandmother in the secret laboratory is very interesting. Including, the past of the grandmother who is related to the witch. At this point, I believe that it makes many viewers a lot more excited about the movie, because that's how I felt too. At that time, I thought the movie was very interesting.
The characters are very good actors and actresses and the scenes in the movie as well as the camera angles are very beautiful, the scenes look very big and grand. The scenes with the hotel next to the sea were very beautiful and also dining room scene.But during the middle of the movie, it doesn't make sense to me at all, everything looked very easy. When the main character transformed, the main character was able to do everything normally. Although the hotel that has many floors, the elevator somehow went up to the floor where the grandmother was. The grandmother knew right away that they became animals, animals that can also talk. But the grandmother's friend, in her memory as a child, was unable to speak a lot of things, making me realize that it didn't make sense. It makes the rating of the movie drop in my opinion.There's nothing in the movie that makes you wanna guess what's going to happen next. To be honest, I understand that the movie had to cut some parts out so that it wasn't too long. But they cut out all of the exciting parts. And the story lacks excitement because we already know what the main character is going to do, making the middle to the end of the story very boring. The beginning of the movie and the plot was quite good and interesting but they made a mistake during the middle to the end of the movie. Overall, the movie turned out to be quite bad in my opinion.The plot of the story is good, CG is good, beautiful scenes and it was a good story at first, but the movie cut out all of the exciting scenes. So for me, I would probably give this movie a 3/10, but for people who like to look at beautiful movie scenes, and you don't want to think too much about movie. or you don't really like exciting movies, I recommend you to watch it once. But if you're hoping for an exciting scary movie, I think you should go watch a different movie instead.",The Witches

533,solangeleichtle,Not as good as the 1990 movie but I still enjoyed it,7,22 October 2020,"I don't get why everyone's calling this a remake. It's not a remake. It's another adaption of the book. I think people need to focus more on comparing the movie to the book rather than the 1990 movie. I will say that the 1990 movie was a lot darker and dramatic while this one is more comedic and light hearted but I never expected this to be a copy of the other movie since again, it's not a remake. Here are what I think are the pros and cons of the movie.Pros:Stayed more true to the book especially the ending, Anne's performance was amazing and I could tell she had fun with this role, I liked Daisy/Mary's story, the costumes were great especially the Grand High Witch's, loved the final battle feel between the grandma and the GHW, the beginning was really well done and emotional, loved the scene of the witches meeting especially the GHW's dialogue and the witches chasing after Luke, Mary and Bruno, even though she didn't have an unmasked form, I still liked what they did with the GHW's ""true look"" and still found it quite terrifying, loved Octavia's performance even though I felt that she was too young for the role.Cons:CGI was over the top, movie seemed a bit rushed, I didn't like the way the grandmother's backstory was played out, was confused as to why the GHW didn't have an unmasked form but I still liked what they did with it (I put that under both the pros and cons list because I was kinda disappointed but I still liked it), felt bad for Bruno's parents that they never got Bruno back, don't get why the main character is just labeled as ""Hero"" instead of Luke or some other name though I can't remember if he was given a name in the book.Overall, I think the biggest highlights of this movie was Octavia and Anne's performances and it staying more true the book than the 1990 movie did even though the time settings were different and they changed the races of the grandma and grandson but I don't mind that.",The Witches

This is supposed to be a family movie. Aimed for your kids. But the jokes and some scenes they added for the younger audience are cheap and unnecessary.

For example how the head witch dies was a nice addition IMO. If you watch it as a stand-alone film and don't compare to OG movie or entirely to the book I think you will enjoy it, kids def will like the new version too. And I thought Hathaway did well, I didn't think of her trying to be Angelica she just did what I think is a character she is used to playing herself as well. Anyway, I really liked it",The Witches
545,ingfu,Worst accent ever,6,23 October 2020,"I enjoyed this well enough when it comes to the story, but when it comes to Anne's ""Norwegian"" accent it makes me want to cry. I'm not particularly patriotic but damn, this is a contender for worst accent ever, worse than Dick Van Dyke doing cockney kind of awful. God forbid anyone thinks us Norwegians actually sound like that😂",The Witches
546,ejone425,What happened here?,4,19 November 2020,"I, like many others, loved the original witches movie. I knew this ""remake"" had cgi and would be set in a modern American south, but this movie was just absolutely terrible. They had a good concept but lost it. The grandma is the best acting in the movie, even Hathaway, who is usually good, was terrible. Her accent was all over the place, she seemed to be trying to pay homage to Houston's grand high witch but lost it and herself along the way. Sadly, the over the top acting, terrible accents and constant cgi took main stage. The movie was campy and cheesy at best. I am truly disappointed.",The Witches
547,jerimarshall81,No seriously...what's the point?,2,25 December 2020,"If you can't improve on a movie, why bother? The original was already well done and well received. So like seriously, what's the point? I love Octavia Spencer, but as another review mentioned, her performance in this felt like a rehash from The Help. The 1990's grandmother was firm, but had a mischeivious side to her. It made her character fun and loveable. I don't wanna be too hard on child actors, but again there was sense of play from the kids in the 1990 film. The 2020 child actors are pretty generic. Anyone coulda done those parts. I will also agree that their perfomances come alive when they are mice....and I'm not sure that's a good thing. Stanley Tucci is lovely as usual, but his presence cannot save the film. And Anne Hathaway.....Oh boy. I don't know how to sum it up. First off, I enjoy her in most things. I think she's a great actress. Even in this movie, her inconsistent accent didn't bother me as much as did others. That's probably because she seemed to be the only actor having any real fun. Having said that, I think she was miscast. She just doesn't have the weight and fear factor Anjelica Houston brought to the original. Houston's performance is both unhinged and hilarious. It toes the line between an kids film and macrabre. Hathaway is doing a ""great job"" but there's nothing exciting about it. She's playing the notes, but I never feel like I'm experiencing a character. Some of that can be blamed on the LAZY direction and cinematogrpahy. The shots of the original puts the viewer on edge and were designed to be unsettling. The backstory of the little girl stuck in the painting is far more effective, than the little girl turning into...a chicken. Maybe this was a more ""kid-friendly"" vibe, because I seriously doubt any kid over 6 would be afraid of this movie. I saw the original when I was 9, and it immediately left an impression! The 1990 film had charming characters you root for, the world had atmosphere, it felt full and it had (gasp) WITCHES!! As in plural!! Not just Anne Hathaway doing all the heavy lifting while, these were extras stand back and do little to nothing. In the original the witches were threatening, yet entertaining because they ALL seemed to want children dead. In this film, Hathaway seems to be the only Witch hellbent on stopping the kiddies. Its like the director forgot to tell them to look engaged. The whole ""remove your wig"" scene is so lackluster. Seriously, when they are trying to step on the mice/kids, their feet even looked bored. Their feet lol! So again, why bother???I mean... I kinda like the twist of the little boy's pet mouse. That was cute I guess. But otherwise, this was a dud. Maybe if movies cut down the CGI, and focus on storytelling, they'd stand a chance of leaving a lasting impression.",The Witches

The aesthetic, the costumes, the sets, were very much needed to be enhanced from the original and zemeckis and co. absolutely delivered.Octavia is fantastic in this one folks, but isn't she just the charming little peach in just about everything she's in, there honey child?The child is no longer cringey and isn't given terrible lines and direction which is a big relief. Remember when the child in the original kept saying ""Grandma!"" in a far too excited and annoying cadence? I do and I still have nightmares.Opening up the film, it's again, so much better. You actually feel for the child losing his parents in this one as it isn't as cold or glossed over like in the 1990 version.Anne Hathaway is just phenomenal as the grand high witch, and I was scared too, as Houston was just superb in the original. She had no problem with portraying a hilarious and genuinely terrifying witch in this.I'll try not to go too far into this one, but there are some much welcomed surprises and twists in this that will delight and entertain the entire family.Go see it.",The Witches

The new version - unfortunately - has a political bent to it which adds nothing to the original movie. This has resulted in unfortunate contradictions such as a line in the movie which states ""witches prey on poor children"" which is soon followed by an attack on a ""wealthy white child"" by the witches. It has also been dumbed down with every plan being fully explained before it's executed - thus no surprises. The racial stereotypes we an unwelcome and unnecessary addition IMO. It's an OK movie if you haven't seen the original but I would recommend the 1990 version over this one.",The Witches

Not even Anne and her terrible accent could save this toned down version!",The Witches
554,laurabarber,Another poor remake of a classic,3,6 March 2021,I generally find most remakes to be pretty terrible and this rehash is no exception.Zemekis has removed all the charm of the original and replaced it with a CGI nightmare accompanied by a jarring and ill placed 60's soul soundtrack.Octavia Spencer does what she can but from the offset I found it so difficult to believe that any Grandmother could be so callous towards a child grieving the loss of both his parents and who thought playing uplifting music should be enough to lift him from his grief. It just seemed so utterly bizarre!We then have Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch. What was her accent supposed to be? I came to the conclusion that the weird Scottish/Russian/German hybrid accent must be on purpose because surely no actress with her pedigree could be that awful?A remakes that didn't need to be made. Just watch the original instead of this overly CGI'd pile of hideousness.,The Witches

Octavia Spencer plays Grandma so lovingly with a cool badass side. Ann Hathaway is brilliant as an evil well dressed stylish witch. And little Hero, well he's so adorable and has the best Levi jeans turn ups! I really like the whole scene is set in 1950's Alabama with a soulful soundtrack. The movie is full of vibrant colour which brings this movie alive. The story is very true to the original. All the characters are a fantastic representation of the original intact, even better. It's a fun, funny and stylish movie for all the family. Give it a try and make your own mind up. It really is a great movie!",The Witches

It's creepy!! Wide Chelsea smile mouths, fang teeth, angulated growing arms, and toes which my 8 year old even said ""mummy the witches are doing the middle finger with their toes"".Octavia was awesome, and the soundtrack was a delight.

I am blown away by how horrible it was.Octavia Spencer carries this entire movie on her back. Somehow she managed to keep me semi-interested and that's the only reason I made it to the end.The worst part of this movie, aside from the complete lack of any depth, is the CGI. How is it possible that in 2020 computer imaging is looking this fake? I agree with what another reviewer posted, it seems like this whole thing was rushed. It's just plain BAD.Not to mention the utter disappointment in Anne Hathaway. Girl, what are you doing!? She's a great actress but could not muster the dark and sinister energy of Anjelica Huston to save her life. Again, in agreement with other reviews, her accent makes no sense whatsoever. Listening to her speak is cringe-worthy.Wish Stanley Tucci could have offered some comic relief, but he's barely noticeable in this film. His parts total about 90 seconds.My last takeaway is that one of the biggest disappointments is the way the witches are portrayed. Not even a little scary... even as rats. There is a clear lack of artistic direction throughout the entire film. Without any Jim Henson-type direction, this movie is a sad flop.
So disappointed:(",The Witches

Obviously the old movie can't compare, but it was one of the best movies I had seen in 2020. I believe it will recieve the hate that the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory remake recieved to begin with, but then people will grow to love it and get past the fact that the previous movie existed.. watch it as if it was not based on an original movie and you will see it from a different perspective.

Most of the good portions were borrowed from the first film, while the new interpretations fall flat. The first witch our protagonist encounters doesn't even attempt to lure or trick the boy. She is immediately creepy, and rather annoying in the way she speaks. Octavia Spencer is fantastic. Kristin Chenoweth comes out of nowhere with no back story. Anne Hathaway, while great on screen, her character's accent makes her nearly incomprehensible throughout the movie. The special effects were nice, but there is very little magic to behold in this version. Viewers of the original will especially feel this during the ending.

It's the quality of CGI in the original ghostbusters films...that's how bad it is.I think the 1990 version of The Witches is a lot better.Roald Dahl is one of the greatest children's writers of all time. There is a magical power in his story telling if you read any of his books. That magic has not been portrayed in this film. It's not in the same league as films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or the BFG.This is literally a remake of the old film. Remakes often need a wow factor to compete with the original...this did not have it. I have the same disappointed as I did after watching the recent Lion King remake, or the Jayden Smith remake of the Karate Kid. Stick with the original film.

576,dbaretos,How did the Dahl estate allow this to happen?,1,23 October 2020,"I can't, for the life of me, even begin to fathom how the Dahl estate allowed this joke of an adaptation to happen. The subtlety, darkness, maturity and poignancy of Dahl's novel and its previous cinematic adaptation are completely missing here. The ending was respected (sort of) this time around; sadly it was a waste of time because the heart wrenching discussion between the boy and the grandmamma about life and death has been replaced with terrible CGI, upbeat music and Chris Rock's ear grating voice.
Anne Hathaway gave it her all, but she was horribly miscast and misdirected here. The role of the grand high witch was taken to ""Mommie Dearest"" levels of camp. What makes the witches so terrifying is the fact that they can pass off as ordinary ladies without raising any suspicions. The witches in this new adaptation give themselves away instantly. Mr. Zemeckis and the scrip writers are utterly incapable of subtlety and atmosfere, it seems.
The grand high witch's transformation is also jaw droppingly lazy. It's just a badly rendered CGI slit mouth, some claws and a dress with an animated snake. That's it. It's such a shame, really. With a more appropriate team this could have done justice to the source material. Also, why on earth was this adaptation so americanised? Are american audiences really that lazy? This adaptation is fails in every possible way and it's not, by any means, as close to Dahl's novel as Robert Zemeckis claimed it would be. This film disrespects both those who have grown up with Dahl's books and the 1990 film and the new generation of children by treating them the very same way in which Mr. Wormwood treated Matilda.",The Witches

After about twenty minutes I thought I had been wrong, the opening had some originality and it seemed like something fresh. then they arrived at the Hotel and Anne Hathaway came on the scene like a wrecking ball. Any potential that this movie had was suffocated by Hathaways incredibly poor performance. Watch Anjelica Huston's performance in the original and you will see the MASSIVE difference in ability. Hathaway's performance is akin to an amateur impressionist. It feel more like an insult than an homage by Hathaway, she put zero effort or spirit into this character. Her accent is atrocious and her presence is almost nonexistent. Also the CGI already looks cheap, c'mon they had better puppets in the 80's. All witches now have joker smiles and shark teeth? This could've really been a good movie and it is just marred by an extremely poor performance from the lead villain, an overuse of cheap effects, poor pacing, lack of originality in the second half and a horrendous ending. The only highlights of this movie are Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno who do a fantastic job of filling and updating their roles. Unfortunately as most fans know, Jahzir spends the second half of the movie as a poorly CGI'd mouse. Leaving Octavia Spencer to carry the entirety of the movie from there on out almost seems like a cruel prank. Tucci is decent as is Codie Eastwick as Bruno but there characters are so poorly written and used they practically add nothing. The addition of a third mouse is also meaningless and changes nothing in the story. Ultimately this movie is a far worse version of the first one. They actually managed to tell less of the story, give characters less development, and have worse effects than a movie made over 30 years ago. Some of this may have been forgivable if they added any decent original concepts but again this is a poor retread with no added substance. Its disheartening to see so many big names attached to this film. Guillermo Del Toro should not put this on his IMBD page. Of course your children will like it, they like Peppa Pig.",The Witches
585,malhartman,Not bad for a 30 year old remake,7,16 November 2020,"Honestly, I really liked this film. I watched them back to back and here's what I think. The original scared me when I was a child. I really liked the original look of the original GHW because it made her stand out from all the others. The original was creepy, but it also had better make up for the witches. I like how they didn't make the shoe and wig removal in the old movie so dramatic. I take off my shoes everyday, but I don't sigh in relief acting as if my parents didn't discover I hid a stash of Halloween candy under my bed. The original I felt could've touched up on some things and toned down on others. For example, we didn't really need the chase scene in the original. I like how they made it more direct and straight to the point in the new one. One thing I've noticed is people complaining about Anne Hathaway's accent. I actually loved her accent. I like how it was Russian and Scottish and Swedish all at once. I also like how it had more of a backstory in the new one. By that I mean how the grandma was a voodoo priestess and knew all about witches. I like how they made the new one with less adult aspects like the manager hitting on the chambermaid. Octavia Spencer was kinda perfect for the role of the grandma. I like how they used more humorous scenes. I think they could've put a little more thought into the transformation in the original, but overall both movies were good. Would recommend, no matter what the other reviews say.",The Witches

589,johnguyleighton,A little Lazy.,3,6 March 2021,"I was so disappointed to see this movie so lazily done with over the top and unrealistic CGI. The charm of the original was the practical effects in the make up and puppets used - this just felt lacklustre and cheap. Any opportunity to gloss over what could have been done with practical effects was just instantly jumped to computer graphics for no good reason - and not even decent ones at that.
The performances on the whole were quite good but I felt the script felt rather forced with try hard humour and gags where they didn't fit.
Lastly - the setting of the USA just felt too ill fitted to the story. I think The Witches unlike Matilda and Charlie is a work by Dahl that only fits into a British setting. It is quintessentially British in it's narrative and characters & so setting the story in Louisiana was a bold choice that sadly - didn't pay off well.
The whole film just felt very Hollywood factory farmed with little to no passion and thought gone into it. There was no quirks, no effort and even large parts of the sets were CG'd into the scenes.
Overall a general Lazy vibe of a movie they knew people would come and see due to the popularity of the original and works of Dahl - they rested on that too hard and when that happens even Hathaway can't save it.",The Witches

Not really much here other than the added diversity which adds different political issues to the film.,The Witches

593,natalieking-93368,What the heck was this!?,1,26 October 2020,"I've not written a review before on here, but I felt compelled to after sitting through this film and wasting £15 for the privilege!
I didn't understand why they had to remake the witches, the original felt authentic and was engaging and fun. The grandma and little boy made a great team and you rooted for them! This one was boring in places, all the actors (except Octavia Spencer) were dreadful, the little boy especially! And Chris Rock as the voice over was annoying, at times you couldn't hear /understand what he was saying!
My children found it frightening, the way Anne Hathaway's mouth opened with those teeth and her extending arms was very much like the clown from IT and the CGI was so obvious. And what accent was she supposed to have? At times it was Scottish/Irish and some kind of Eastern European!!?
I wouldn't recommend it, stick with the original!",The Witches

I will recommend watching this film with a clear mind, and don't try to link it with the 1990s movie. if you've seen it already. Movies express a current situation in our society, and in the 1990's the world was different from today's. So this new story has its won identity to sympathized with the world as it is today.

They both had to save the world from the Witch. CG is good but not great. The witch in this film is designed in a unique way, unlike the common witch in the other films. She is very scary, funny, ugly and weird. The story became excited since the witch appeared until the middle of the film, which the protagonist and her friends had to fight against the witch and her pensioners. The fight scene is so fun. I think the film is too short. There is a scene that the protagonist were cursed into rats. Whoever like Toy Story or Ratatouille may like this film too. The Witches is not the film for little kids because there are some violence and adult jokes.",The Witches

651,avamaeblack-65270,Why do people hate this?,8,6 March 2021,"People are giving this a bad rep because it's scary for a children movie but they clearly haven't read his books. His books would be considered scary to children like come on. Children getting sucked up into pipes, children being hunted by witches, children being put into a torture device, of course this movie is scary for children! He wrote things like that. People are also saying they should've used animatronics but they don't realise that animatronics cost a lot and would take a while to program to move and act the way they achieved with cgi, sure it's not the best quality but it is really good and Anne Hathaway killed this role (in a good way) and the costumes are amazing",The Witches
652,avamaeblack-65270,What's with the hate?,8,7 March 2021,Sure Anne's accent is all over the place but the ending is closer to the book and this film is not a remake of the original movie. This is another adaptation of Dahls book. The cgi is not the greatest but the costumes are amazing and people complain about the fact that the mice and cat are cgi and not animatronics. In my opinion I prefer the cgi over animatronics (although the cat should be real or a animatronic) just because the mice are adorable and the detail on the rats having little bald spots are awesome. I also prefer the way they turn into rats/mice in this version rather than puffs of smoke I like how they explode in a way,The Witches
653,adavidromerowsp,"Good start, Slow middle, Bad ending.",5,5 January 2021,"2020's retelling of Roald Dahl's the Witches, brings a unique perspective of the world of Witches set in 1967 Alabama. The film starts out quite well, with some interesting camera work, great screen performance by Octavia Spencer, and Chris Rocks relatively well narration that not only sets the tone, but reminds the viewer that this is a Roald Dahl themed story. There clearly was a lot of attention to detail, which one can appreciate, but unfortunately these nice things don't make up for what the film lacked.Once Octavia Spencer and Jahzir Bruno (the main child) reach the hotel where most of the film takes place, it all goes downhill. The film was quite slow and struggled to work with the genuinely interesting world that they created. Although Anne Hathaway's performance did invoke emotions of intimidation and even fear, but her confusing accent at many times took away from her performance.The CGI and effects in some scenes felt dated and generally poor (mice transformation, mice movement), while other (particularly Anne Hathaway) scenes provided cool and even disturbing effects. While this film was most likely made for in-theatre 3D effects, too many scenes where sacrificed for cheap 3D effects that where directed towards children and took away from the experience.Although this film does stick closer to the original book and introduces a beautiful Alabama setting, strong Octavia Spencer and at times Anne Hathaway performances, the film struggles to stay consistent in its themes and pacing. The film generally feels sloppy and leaves many fans of the original film dissatisfied.",The Witches

Not the original ending to the first movie, and to be honest I didn't care for the ending at all, but the rest of the movie was great.Also, everyone complained about Anne Hathaway's accent and I loved it. It was over the top and ridiculous just like the Grand High Witch is supposed to have.

686,tj_bott,Lame,5,1 November 2020,"Was hoping for a good remake but it was pretty bland. I really quite liked Anne's Grand High Witch but she wasn't a patch on Angelica.

One still feels sense of nostalgia so its an excellent film for parents who are fans of the original to share with their children. More night or dimly lit scenes would have helped convey the fear or macabre of the villains.

The vfx and animation are a huge improvement over the makeup and live action shots of real mice running around.
But the plot is virtually identical, and there wasn't much to that plot to begin with.
When I saw Del Toro, Zemekis and Cuaron's names, I thought I was in for something special. Damn was I wrong. Essentially you could give this book to 100 directors to adapt and direct their way, and you get maybe 4 or 5 versions that could be great, and this is not one of them.",The Witches

Saying that though, I also wanted to honest at home bad a remake this was. First all of the story has no depth to it! It more or less goes straight into the main plot without any real build-up! When you don't set the scene, you loose the essence of the story. Secondly, the Hollywood CGI was well overdone! It's as if they had to add all the CGI because the story was so bad!

Firstly way too much too much attention is paid into the special effects without much focus on anything else.My gripes, the grandma, she's very cold at the start, doesn't fill you with the same sense of comfort the original grandma in the 1st movie did.Brunos parents, in the original movie you had a bit of dialogue from the father which gave you a sense of what type of person he is, this movie basically did nothing to create any type of secondary characters outside the main 3/4The hotel manager, in the original movie he was a bit of a snivelling stuck up so and so whos character you started to hate but he redeemed himself at the end, in this one the manager just looks confused and has no redeeming qualities at allAll in all a disappointment, the original set itself up as a very dark childrens film where as this one was more focused on trying to be too dark than actually being so and just looked comedic at times, a shame because the story itself has so much potential",The Witches
695,mathias-bradley,A Very Straightforward Decently Done Remake,9,23 October 2020,"I went into this with very low expectations, having read the book as a child and seen the original movie. If I'm going to be completely honest, anyone who hasn't seen this film needs to go in without seeing reviews because there is a clear bias against it. It is a very decent if not very straightforward remake that perhaps simplifies Roald Dahl's story a bit to be a bit cleaner cut whilst keeping it fresh and modern. Just enough backstory is given to keep children aware and adults interested. The movie has beautiful visuals and the acting is actually very good with special mentions going to both Octavia Spencer and Anne Hathaway's performances.The latter I tried to dislike but her habit of chewing the scenery and penchant for over the top villainy make her a perfect villain although at times, her attempt at an Eastern European accent can be a bit jarring. The child actors, Jahzir Kareem Bruno and Codie-Lei Eastick, we see in the lead roles are both very good in their limited screen time and their voice overs are professional. As an African-American male, I personally enjoyed the subtle references which came off as relatable but not too forced as to make it exploitative especially in a children's film. I loved how the film added in the aspects of the witches preying on those who wouldn't be missed or were vulnerable. All in all, this is a wonderful film and I feel any fan of the original and the book will love this straightforward but very good remake.",The Witches

699,dlivingstone-40981,So much potential,3,31 October 2020,I was so excited about this remake. The acting was not great and the adaptation of the original story is weak.

700,henrysaltandson,I Couldn't Really Watch It All,1,14 November 2020,"If I hadn't been a childhood fan of the original, I'm sure I might have enjoyed this more. The effects in that film felt organic, the performances were really full, and the pacing gave the events their importance.In this film everything's happening at break-neck pace; **the characters seem to know what's going on before they should.** The special effects are beautiful, but blazing; they're unnecessarily complex and fancy, which makes me feel like it's not really real. The comedy is forced -- in fact, the performances seem just canned. I don't think it's the actors' fault. I think the lines and the editing make them awful. This isn't a broadway play, it's community theater.I hope you enjoy it, but I genuinely think you'll like the old one better.",The Witches

It was still an enjoyable watch with the kids, the loving grandmother and the creepy witches still made an impact. All tinged with Roald's ability to weave in real life challenges; loss, grief and bravery.

The slightly different storyline, was perfectly executed with a spooky yet funny climax. Octavia spencer did a wonderful job, like she always does.

It makes barely any sense, no depth, no storyline... How is it even possible to ruin a story like that?!

When I heard about the remake coming out I was excited but despite Anne Hathaway being a good actress she didn't beat Anjelica Huston. I don't understand the weird French accent that has been added because it has no value except it being over the top. The original girl in the painting story has turned into some ridiculous chicken story which makes me wonder if it is in any way related to the fact that most characters have been replaced by coloured ones as well. Theres are too many references to stereotypes, racism and the differences between rich and poor. It's a children's book turned into an oscar winning movie because it has been turned into a movie about society and racism. It's disappointing how it's nothing like the original and you can't watch anything nowadays without it pointing out every problem we have in society because that's totally what kids should be worrying about.",The Witches

The make up in the original is far surperior to the terrible CGI in this movie. If you check out the drawings in the book, the Grand witch is way off in this movie.

The story is similar enough to be considered a remake, but the minor differences keep it interesting!It's been given the Hollywood treatment for sure, so it's far glossier/more polished than the original, but having just watched them back to back, unless it's just nostalgia you're after, then that's no bad thing I promise.Overall the quality of the story itself shines through, and if you just want to have some fun watching it then you will certainly do just that.If you're looking to review it for Oscar-worthiness then maybe reassess your expectations, chill out and grab a drink.

716,sb06226,I so wanted to love this movie....,2,3 November 2020,"I grew up with the original Witches and I was looking forward to this remake (and I never look forward to remakes). The previews looked great - I liked that they mixed up the storyline a little by changing the setting, adding in new characters and changing the approach. I really like Anne Hathaway, and she was certainly the standout in this rendition, but that might be all I can say for it.The movie started out well. I liked the way they introduced the characters. I think updating the witches and the setting of the story was smart - it was a great way to reach a broader audience. I also liked how they showed the bond between the central two after the loss of his parents/her daughter. It was sweet and the young man in the movie was doing a great job, definitely a talented young actor. But the movie took a nose dive as soon as Grandma started talking about witches.Turning Grandma into the backstory, authority on witches, and moral compass was a huge mistake. I realize that getting Octavia Spencer in probably required a larger role, but this was ridiculous. I didn't mind that she had her own story about them, honestly. But she just kept yammering on (in many scenes, about all things) - it made the movie drag and removed a lot of plot discoveries. She spelled everything out and it really took away the magic of Roald Dahl's story. Even the 'will they make it' moments were destroyed by their existing knowledge from grandma. She knew way too much about the witches and magic in general, which is not really well explained (other than being a voodoo priestess, maybe). Her character was terribly written and played way too large of a role.Still, I was prepared to come on here and say watch it, you might think it is OK if you like this style of storytelling. I was even prepared to give it a middle of the line grade. While boring, they did really recreate this, rather than try to duplicate the original. I was happy to look past poor graphics and CGI (the budget for which was clearly thrown into the cast). I thought, someone will like this well enough. Then, they did something ridiculous...They don't change back! You have a young boy who is happy to live maybe 9 years as a mouse, no 'good witch' to fix the situation, and everyone is just cool with the fact that Bruno's parents are going to pass on him if he is a mouse. The ending they created just destroyed anything positive you could say up until this point. Every choice was bad (aside from chasing after all the bad witches). Just one wrong move after another to end the movie. I am quite sad to write this review, but I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed with the film.",The Witches

Can't you all just enjoy the fresh new take on the story and quit whining about how it's ""just not the same?""...CGI was NOT overdone in my opinion. The fact that they changed the setting of the story to Alabama really doesn't detract from the main story line anywhere near as bad as what these book ""puritans"" and whiny 90's nostalgic ""kids"" make it out to be.

I totally understand that all people have opinions but Seriously 1/10 what the f@#k, you'd be the type of person to complain about everything. It's 2020 so I should expect it wouldn't be like the original and made for the current generation. If kids could review on here they would praise it because in the theatre we watched it in there was laughter and cringing, ohhhs and arhhhs in all the right spots.

Not Anne Hathaways best. Plus I couldn't get over the voice for Daisy. It's supposed to be a girl. Kristin Chenoweth has a very distinguished voice, clearly not a child's voice. Especially against actual kids voices. I didn't realize it was almost three hours of this as I fell asleep halfway through. Tried watching it again with my kids but they lost interest. My 11 year old said it was like two different movies, you have the scary, really great makeup and affects of the witches to talking mice. Two different ends of the spectrum. I can't say it was terrible because the makeup was really good and it does have a great cast, just not good performances and the movie itself wasn't at all what I was hoping for.

725,loubug-16500,Take a breather haters!,7,1 November 2020,"First, I'd never heard of the original Witches until the trailer for the remake. We watched the old one and liked it, but the old robotic mice creeped me out and I can't see my kids loving it like the movies being made today. It's not a stab at the old one, just the truth. Times have evolved in movie making and the new one proves it. The story was not in depth like the first one, at least in the witch scenes. I can excuse it because it left room for the grandma and Luke to bond and some new scenes to add to the fun aspect of being mice. Their background was a retelling and you can't be mad at it because the setting is in Georgia, not Norway so the original story of the girl in the painting wouldn't work. The new story was meant to capture kids' imagination and I think it achieved it. Anne's accent was just as hard to understand as Angelica's so I wish they would've improved on that. These two ladies shouldn't be compared because I enjoyed what they both brought to the characters. It's a retelling, not an exact copy! Each movie has their own high's and lows, which should just be enjoyed, not picked apart because grown adults think it it should only be done ONE way. The retelling was fun and meant to capture the attention of kids, which I think it did. It brought a new audience to an old forgotten movie and it's new companion. I recommend it!",The Witches

This is the first time this 2020 that I felt so happy and connected to a movie. It sparked some sort of childhood nostalgia which surprised me.

The unreal of CGI distracts you because it does not fit the image. After they turn into mice the film becomes boring and monotonous because everything else of the context is lost, even the hotel seemed dull. Without a doubt this movie has nothing redeemable, the casting promised to give us a good movie, however Anne Hathaway's performance seemed a bit fake, and the essence of the character was lost due to the terrible CGI , Octavia Spencer's performance was good but it could have developed the character more and Stanley Tucci barely appeared.

734,ollieblinknufc,A heinous Hollywood disaster!,1,29 November 2020,"This has to be one of the most heinous remakes of a film that I have ever seen. Anne Hathaway's delivery with a hybrid of about five changeable accents throughout the film, makes her character incoherent and very difficult to understand. On some occasions, I believe most skilled MI5 interpreters and trained linguists would not actually assimilate what was actually coming out of her mouth at times. Her character is a shadow of Angelica Huston's prowess as ""The Grand High Witch"". An American disaster remake with over the top CGI in your face from start to finish. The continuous and monotonous narration throughout this film disrupted any realism throughout. Nicolas Roeg obviously tried to capture the mystical and magic mind of Roald Dahl's children's dark fantasy novel in his 1990 film, which still retains a cult following to this day. The makeup and potential was all laid out on the table for this to be a fantastic remake. Unfortunately, Hollywood grabbed it by the horns and stripped it of all its magic, comedy and dark fantasy themes. Robert Zemeckis's retelling of the wicked children's story feels more grumpy than scary, while its comedy veers between frantic and strained. The original 1990 film was more faithful to the book albeit the ending. As a British child who grew up in the 90's, engrossed in Dahl's novels, this has to be by far the most unendurable and vast substandard film I have endured in a long time. 1/10. That is being generous.",The Witches

It's slow, badly written, difficult to follow and feels cheap. Not a patch on the original. It feels like Hollywood tried to appease some sort of BLM agenda but if they wanted to be inclusive they could have just remade a good version of this with a predominantly black cast. What they've actually done is try too hard and almost mock black culture.
It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen",The Witches
737,lisaandrews-76319,Pay no attention to the naysayers,7,1 January 2021,"This is a fun movie for kids. Just creepy enough to be interesting for them, and full of action. It's not the greatest movie of all time but it's nowhere near as bad as all these reviews say it is. If you don't have some weird hard on for the original and can accept that two movies can exist side by side and that a remake takes nothing away from the original (it's a remake, not a replacement, folks. The original still exists, duh) then you'll enjoy it - at least your kids will. There are plenty of kids movies out there that I can barely stand to have on because they're so obnoxious but this is not one of them; in fact, I find myself pausing what I'm doing to watch it when it's on. It's a bit cartoonish and over the top but it's based on a kids book and it's for kids, so that's kind of the point. Who cares. It's fun for children and won't make parents want to pull their hair out, so 7/10.",The Witches

But most importantly, there is pretty violent scenes who make even adults uncomfortable. Within the first 30 min, most of the kids in the theater started crying and parents had to leave the movie.For adults, movie is disturbing and boring, total absence of humour that you would expect for a children movie.I strongly believe this movie PEG should be changed to 15+ but even with that, this is probably the worst movie I seen in years.",The Witches

So a bunch of 40 something year olds projecting their midlife crisis issues on this great movie... Thankfully, I can't say anything about the original and didn't read any of the reviews here, but I also can't think of any recent kids movies that kept our whole family, kids and adults alike, as entertained as this wonderful Robert Zemeckis' film. Kids are really looking forward to a sequel!",The Witches
744,tototorazzi,Couldn't even remake it well,2,2 December 2020,"This movie is terrible, downright terrible nothing can save and it has almost no redeeming properties. First of all the acting, the acting in this movie was appalling especially from the children which couldn't give any convincing lines, not only that the acting from Anne Hathaway wasn't any good either, her accent was all over the place, sometimes it was German(of which it was fairly racist) other times Scottish and sometimes just her natural voice, the only half good performance in the film was Octavia Spencer who was fine but not amazing. Now onto the CGI, which may I add is absolutely terrible, the old practical effects of the original still somewhat hold up today the CGI in this movie is already dated an will properly look terrible in 3 years everything looks unrealistic and awkward. Now onto the script, some of the lines are absolutely terrible for example 'Sometimes things just happen in life' and 'a human mouse lives for about 9 years(then the grandson says) YAY we can die together' not even worried that he's gonna die in 9 years and instead says 'I won't have to learn to drive a car'. When the script wants to be funny it's not but in serious moments I couldn't help but laughing. Next the child's mentality completely changes halfway through the movie, in the bogging and even at the hotel he's quiet while when he turns into a mouse suddenly he's heroic. Now onto points about this being a remake. Honestly I didn't mind the race element with the main characters now being black, honestly I didn't mind this and I'm not sure why people are so upset. But on the other hand the witches powers completely change with them now being able to fly and extend their arms, simply for the sake of plot, this doesn't stay close the the original and actively worsens it. Now to the movies one redeeming factor and the reason I gave it 2 stars. Before I went into this movie I hadn't seen anything about it but when we got to the end and I saw it was directed by Robert Zemeckis I couldn't help but bursting into to laughter, and when the movie continued I thought it was some sought of joke(which would of brought the movie to a 7) but Robert did actually direct it which is pretty funny.Anyway, bad movie bad everything nothing good about it apart from the fact it was directed by Robert Zemeckis which made me laugh.",The Witches

They weren't even bothered to use, real broken wood which shows how lazy they were. There was no connection to the characters, everything felt very sterile.

Its sugar coated with the Walt Disney atmosphere, esthetics are pleasant, staged in an interesting context and grandmother is a joy to watch; but most character's are weak, Anne Hathaways attempt as the Grand High Witch can be viewed with certain good efforts but will never compare to Angelica Huston sensuous and enigmatic performance that captivates the viewer to fall in love with her.
As for the other character's..
The rest of the witches have little to none participation, the CGI removes all the human/crude aspect of them, leaving a detached feeling to the viewers.
The three children/mice are bland but pasable and Chris Rocks voice completely unnecessary.
Was it enjoyable..yes

787,lycanjedi,A Great update to the Original,9,27 October 2020,"As someone who grew up with The original film I wondered if they would make a crappy remake. The simple answer is no, I don't think they did. The film closely follows the Original with very minor tweaks to make it unique. The design of the Witches is Fantastic, maybe not as creepy as the original Grand High witch but definitely kept some creepiness to it. The unique change of a third mouse brings more uniqueness to the story if only slightly. And The Soundtrack is great! Picked some great 60s/70s songs and The Orchestrated Music Really adds to each scene! The few turnoffs (of which there were few) for me were :The crassness of the Grandmother towards the beginning. I get it was to help the kid but she basically tells him to stop crying about something traumatic.The use of CGI for every animal. It worked don't get me wrong but even the Grand High Witches cat was CGI. I feel it wasn't necessary even if it was to set up perch scenes a cat wouldn't normally do.Beyond that the film is great for all ages. Parents warned: Your little ones may be afraid of The Grand High Witch scenes after they take the disguises off. It's nothing major, a little CGI editing to the mouth and some practical/CGI claws on her hands but might be enough to scare. Overall a great remake and very enjoyable!",The Witches

799,eggfishbops,"Fun To Look At, Barely Entertaining, Anxiety Inducing",4,3 November 2020,"I liked the movie from a glance, paying attention to it was interesting. I thought this movie took place in a later time period because, seeing as the characters were people of color in the 60s, them being able to get that hotel stay wasn't nearly suspicious enough to the people. Sure they were questioned but it wasn't sufficient enough I'd think. Another thing, there's many scenes in the movie where your expectations are diverted but certainly not in the good way. You see some situation that could turn out bad, nothing bad happens. I have no clue what it is but this movie felt like it was purposely trying not to traumatize the child audiences like the first movie adaptation did. They fail, with absolutely horrifying sound effects and transformation sequences, but even still they somehow decided that watering down the action sequences would be smart. There's a scene where the 3 mice characters are passing through the hotel. At every turn, you feel like someone will spot them, something will happen. They make mistakes, are all over the place, even get spotted by one cleaning lady at one point. Every other character just blows it off as her being conveniently dramatic and it doesn't even pose a problem, it just moves on. Throughout it was just ""Oh no here's where they get caught"" or ""Oh yeah the camera is going to pan down to reveal the cat is waiting for him"" or SOMETHING but none of it ever comes. What does happen though? This TERRIFYINGLY bleak ending. The mice are NEVER turned back to people. NEVER. That's so TRAGIC. They're just fine with it even though at the end this kid-turned mouse is just like, ""I'm happy I'm a mouse now, I can die at the same time as you grandma."" Like, OH MY GOD THAT'S SO SAD. He's like 14 in human years now and he's just TOTALLY fine with dying. Did he have no hopes? No dreams? I genuinely think this kid is just so traumatized from his parents dying like 30 seconds into the film and no one taking this horrible trauma seriously (the grandma literally just makes him dance it off like WHAT) and him being unable to get help that he oppresses it and it eventually turns into this CHILD wanting to DIE at like 14. I do not get it, this movie is so sad and horribly heartbreaking and we never even find out what the other two kid-mice went on to do, are they a part of the witch hunters??? I HAVE NO CLUE. Not to MENTION how that couple just...ACCEPTS THEY'VE LOST THEIR SON FOREVER WHEN GOING TO LEAVE THE HOTEL. THESE PARENTS HAVE LOST THEIR CHILD AND DO NOTHING. HE'S DEAD TO THEM. WHAT. Anyway yeah watch this movie for an anxiety inducing, bleak tale of children being turned to mice and no one being able to stop or reverse it so instead they probably poison a chef who went to check to see if the pea soup was good (y'know chefs taste the food before sending it out but I guess that dude's just gone, now that I think about it how did they know the soup was bland as humans?

808,draughtproofwindows,lost opportunity,3,1 December 2020,"I don't agree with a lot of the negative comments here. Hathaway's accent is fine (the book mentions a non-descript foreign accent and she ticks that box fine). The use of CGI is fine, is not overly done. The adaptation of the story, location etc.. is fine, like countless other adaptations. And the 1990 film was ok, just. It wasn't some masterpiece as some have made it out to be. What is not ok is:1 - the film isn't funny, ever. The book makes you smile, giggle and laugh out loud. The film's poor script probably is its biggest failing.
2 - the film takes a long time to get going.
3 - the portrayal of three fingered witches was wrong, as disability adovates have pointed out (it's not in the book btw).
4 - the portrayal of the boy was awful for much of the beginning of the film. He is totally deprived of any emotion, rendering him completely unsympathetic (same issue with the 1990 version). And yet he gets Chris Rock's joyful voiceover as an adult? it doesn't add up.To give the film a different take on the book it could have given it a voodoo inspired take on things which I think would well.",The Witches

I get the elements of this film was more like the book and for that I liked, such as the boy staying a mouse, the witches having no hands instead claws, (which I think people over reacted and people having to apologise) because witches have disfigured hands! Read the book it isn't a dig at people with disability it's part of the story! Anyway, the original which is one of my favourites made me realise how shocking this film actually was. Anna Hathaway was to 'nice' and to 'obvious' spitting out her drink seeing children ect, was WAY over the top, the grand high witchxwljld never give herself away and I feel that's why I love Angelica Houston so much playing her her accent, her prosthetics, her image, her body language was incredible and when watching this one I just felt 'meh' nothing gave me excitement, it was just a film that passed time, and I didn't get any feeling from it which is such a shame as I was so looking forward for it!

I loved this new adaptation of one of my favourite childhood books. And yes, I saw the 1990 adaptation. But it's not fair to compare the two movies as if the new one is a remake of the 1990 one. It's just two different adaptations of the book, and both are good. I like how close the new one stays to the book. I'm 41, so it's been a while since I read the book, but it was so well done I instantly remembered parts of the book. I was very impressed with the acting of Jahzir Bruno who plays ""Hero Boy"" in the first part of the movie. The quality of the opening scenes is very high and it immediately drags you in. Jahzir's performance of a downhearted boy is very convincing and I had to wipe away some tears. Loved Octavia Spencer in her role as his grandma. When I was a kid they didn't have much special effects yet and it's always amazing to see how today's special effects can make a childhood story come to life. The mice are very well done and so cute. Don't understand the complaining about CGI...
Overall this was a funny enjoyable movie and a wonderful retelling of a tale I loved so much as a kid. I thoroughly recommend it!
And yes, the setting is different (America), but that doesn't make it a bad movie. It's refreshing! When the movie started I was excited to see the main characters are people of colour. This kind of representation is important. Must be great for kids to see main characters they can relate to. White people complaining here about the main characters not being white should be ashamed of themselves. Applaud it, sit back and enjoy the movie.",The Witches

Overall, we watched as a family and we thought it was great. As soon as we left the movie theatres, my daughter said ""let's watch it again""!

823,manitac-61988,It's not all good but it is good fun movie,5,5 March 2021,"The movie ""The witches"" directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis
is based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The plot is quite interesting and fantasy. brings a unique perspective of the world of Witches set in 1967 Alabama, a young orphaned boy goes to live with his loving grandma in the rural Alabama town of Demopolis. As the boy and his grandmother encounter some deceptively glamorous but thoroughly diabolical witches. The film stars are Oscar-winning Les Misérables star Anne Hathaway plays the Grand High Witch, and is joined by Octavia Spencer as grandmother to Bruno, one of the boys who fights the witches, Comedian Chris Rock (Fargo) acts as narrator and, etc. This film rating is PG means children under 13 do not see and including scary images and it doesn't manage to capture any of the childish wonders that come with one of the author's most playfully scary works. The film starts out quite well, with some interesting camera work , great screen performance by Hathaway's over-the-top performance is bound to creep out the kiddies in this capable if overstuffed production. And Spencer's performance is the heart and soul of this fabulous film. The film is an occasionally competent but more often innocuous work that is long on special effects but short of the kind of charm and excitement. But unfortunately these nice things don't make up for what the film lacked.

There were scenes added that didn't need to be there. The explanation of everything before it happened was annoying and Dahl's brilliant story telling was nowhere to be seen. The costumes and CGI were off. The rich story of the grandmother and the children in the paintings, not even mentioned. No storyline for the majority of the other witches and the three fingers instead of claws? I don't know what that was about. Very saddened to see another children's story dumb down the language and over explain everything. If a film has to be made based on a book, especially one as iconic as The Witches, it should at least try to bring it to life.

836,akamban-1,Not bad but not what it could've been,7,24 October 2020,"To start off, I did not dislike this version. There are many positives in this film but I was hoping for a more Coraline type of feel and the final product was too family friendly yet also a little too dark for young kids. Had GDT stayed on as director, we would've had a phenomenal film. Zemeckis just has seemed to lost his touch over the years, having more flops than successes. This movie had a phenomenal cast, many Oscar winners working on the film, and yet it still left a lot to be desired.When comparing this version to the 1990 version-
I like the grandma character more in this version though I'm sad they didn't do more with her past. Not to mention they could have went into all of her stories. This was a huge missed opportunity by all those involved.
The grandson actor is good but he's very subdued until he turns into a mouse. It feels like two different people. Same as with Bruno to an extent. Though, I liked that Bruno was like-able and I liked Mary but once again they should've shown her taking chocolate from the GHW and turning into a mouse.
Anne Hathaway did good, they could have made the ballroom scene more demented and darker. There were so many things left out of the book in regards to this scene that I would have liked to of seen- the demented songs, the laser type sparks coming out of her eyes to fry the witch was scarier in the book. Not to mention the absence of the mask.
I liked the grandma's house better in the old one but I liked the hotel more in this one. The set was impressive as far as the hotel goes. Though the grandma was wealthy as a kid and as an adult. They missed so many opportunities showing her childhood experiences with witches, her family vacations, and having a large Tudor house. Especially with race-bending. I always pictured her and her husband being anthropologists or something similar where they could travel a lot but with the hidden agenda of witch hunting.
The CGI was a miss in this version for the most part. Not awful but far from what it could've been. GDT initially wanted this film to be stop motion. And there were elements that just could've been scarier and closer to the book. The depth just wasn't there.
I didn't like the ending in either version really. I didn't like the witch show down in her room in this version. At all. They should have ended with the grandmother and grandson (and friends maybe) going to the GHW's castle and carrying out there plan. Another HUGE opportunity missed.
I didn't like all the changes they made to witches features but the wide smile was unsettling. I liked that the GHW looked deceptively young and pretty in the original but was actually very old underneath her mask. The wide smile could've included scarier sequences (like gnawing off the grandmother's thumb as a kid). I missed the absence of blue spit and little tid bits that the grandmother learned.Hopefully Warner Brothers will lend out rights down the road or do another version with a better direction. This version wasn't awful but far from what it should have been. Had GDT, Henry Selick or Taika Waititi been the director this movie could have been 10/10 instead of a 6 or 7 out of 10.",The Witches

However, the 1990 version was very good in my opinion (apart from the ending). When I heard about a remake I thought it should be interesting considering movie making has evolved so much in 30 years. But sadly it left me questioning the movie makers sanity.
The original actually spooked you out in the early exposition. There was pain and emotion felt for the lead characters' loss. But in this version I felt no threat from the witches nor any emotional connection with the protagonist. The witches were laughable and weak. Anne Hathaway, who is a marvellous actress, comes across as comedic and pathetic in this version of the grand high witch. Octavia Spencer is her usual wonderful self however the material given to her is so weak.
I wonder if the film makers were trying to play it safe for rating issues? I wonder if they were trying to creatively evolve the the story for today's audience?

Love his welcoming grandmother (played by the wonderful Octavia Spencer) and as a black man I relate to this story a lot more than the original. The music used was perfectly used as well as Chris Rock's narration. I thought Anne Hathaway did a great job and the effects were pretty decent.

Haters Need To Calm Down,7,1 October 2021,"I've been reading a lot of the reviews on here and my initial thoughts are ""What the fuuuu-""If you actually think this film is only worth 1 out if 10 then you're either deranged or an outraged fan of the original.Now I am a huge fan of the book and the original film (which came out when I was 9 - so I was target audience). It actually shaped my tastes as an adult as I now an avid horror fan. The 90s Witches was actually a horror film and I love it. But uh... It also came out like 31 years ago? Have you watched it recently? I love the film still from the FX to the performances... However, it looks OLD AF. Thus a remake becomes necessary.I'm not one to usually support the concept of a remake especially in the instance of something like Total Recall. But come on guys... The Witches is a KIDS film set a presumed present day. It had to be updated.My assessment of the remake is its super duper fun! You will laugh and jump as long as you don't sit there arms folded and pouting like a 9 year old thats had their fave movie taken from them.The performances kick ass, especially Anne Hathaway. The criticism of her accent is utterly moronic. She is intentionally over the top and ""cartoony""The film does suffer slightly from identity crisis swinging styles from kids drama to cartoon back and forth. But it really works. I think a lot of people simply don't understand what the film makers are trying to achieve here.I loved sitting down with my son and sharing this version of The Witches with him - followed up by the original. Yeah its not the 90s film -because its a remake that actually does things differently and it mostly does them well. So calm down haters.Cons-

Now older, I was so excited for this remake. They sometimes say ""remakes"" and the ""second movie"" isn't quite like the first or as good as the first movie. It has majority of the same theme/plot/characters, but Anne Hathaway playing the Grand High Witch is very different than the original performance. I think she did a great job, but it was a lot of CGI (her mouth in particular), which at times felt a little distracting. The children ""mice"" were SO adorable, and Octavia was so delightful playing the grandma. Your kids might be a little afraid of some of the CGI, but it was not more scary than the first in my opinion. It was still so fun to watch, and people are tough critics these days, so I'd take the really harsh reviews with a grain of salt.",The Witches

Great watch for the littles, teens and adults!I read through the reviews and I'm not certain why so many rated it poorly (well I have an idea). Perhaps they are purists without imagination.

Anne Hathaway really makes it her own. Pacing was spot on as well.

There's a lot of grumpy middle aged people out there who don't like change, don't like that fact there are black actors in the film, and also seem to have forgotten this is meant to be a children's film.

Octavia Spencer transforms her character from a kind and caring grandmother into a bitter black magic guru, something that ironically makes her a witch as well. The mice were caramelized with CGI makes us comfortable with the idea that they will never be children again, which is wrong. Stanley Tucci destroyed the role of the butler and took away his comical love affair with one of the employees.
They squashed a good story with some 21st century CGI and flanderized the characters, making this one of the worst remakes in movie history.",The Witches

Also, some of the changes just felt pointless, once it creates plot holes that make you think no one was making a real effort. [SPOILERS: Why make the grandma a sorcerer if she gives up making the reverse potion after just one attempt? Why make her leave the house trying to escape from witches (instead of a trip to heal) just to go to the same place the witches are? END OF SPOILERS.] I was expecting some new layer of meaning that could show some sense of relevance in the decision of making a reboot, but it doesn't add anything.

I even thought that with actors like Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway that it might be saved, and they were great in their roles as far as remaking/re-imagining movies go. But even with that, the grandmother is sort of a rehash of Spencer's character Minnie from The Help, Stanley Tucci hardly gets ANY screen time or character development, and Hathaway, while nailing so many of Angelica Houston's mannerisms, is still a bit overdone on her character. But also the remake lacks the character/story development, decent plot, dialogue and even the action and tense scenes from the original. And the transformation scenes (minus the one in the beginning which I thought was a good add) were extremely short with bad CGI.

904,frisbeethrow-06833,"NOT BAD AT ALL, BUT FAR FROM PERFECT",9,23 October 2020,"This new 2020 adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic has its flaws, but it skyrockets above all the lukewarm live action Disney remakes that have been produced over the past 10 years. While critics might be quick to dismiss the film in comparison to the original 1990 adaptation, it has potential to be a sleeper hit and gain a cult following for future generations.Anne Hathaway gives a GRAND performance as the Grand High Witch, with classic campy terror and vaudevillian shtick humor (minus the dodgy German accent). Although Hathaway might not instill the same terror upon younger viewers as Anjelica Houston, she none the less delivers a balanced and entertaining performance that is all her own. Let's just say that if you are a fan of Miss Hathaway, you will be content with her performance, and may never be able to watch The Princess Diaries or The Dark Knight Rises like you once did. A true testament to the raw talent that Hathaway has.Octavia Spencer plays the role of the grandmother with all the tough love and southern spunk that you would expect to find in a grandmother. Spencer might have been too young to play a grandmother, but her mild mannered yet passionate performance, radiates the film against the madness in Hathaway's performance. Clear eyed, charming, witty, and devoid of irony, Spencer nearly outshines Hathaway when they are on screen together.The highest praise of this film goes to Hollywood newcomer, Jahzir Bruno, playing the hero boy who triumphs against the forces of evil. Bruno was perfectly cast in this role, and despite his young age, is very believable and sincere in his delivery. His character is perfectly relatable, down to earth, humble, and never displays any obnoxious adolescent moments. While watching the movie, kids will identify with his fears, and adults will be moved by his bravery and loyalty to those he loves.",The Witches
905,joshwilko,When taking creative liberties goes too far,1,26 February 2021,"I first want to thank the Witches for being so bad that it's inspired me to relog into IMDb after many years just to review it. Now, I know there was a tall task to live up to the 1990 version, in which Anjelica Houston stole the show and was a cause of many childhood nightmares. Unfortunately, this remake 30 years later fails on all fronts.Firstly, the writers must have been drinking some maddening potion when they were altering the plot. Without spoiling everything (the movie does that itself), it's like they looked at every single scene in the original and asked ""how can we deliberately make this worse?"". In this version we get characters bordering on caricature with the only believable performance coming from Octavia Spencer as the grandmother. The grand high witch is thorougly disappointing and not at all deserving of the title, and Chris Rock as the narrator is a bizzare choice which thankfully informs the viewer from the beginning that they're in for a mess of epic proportions.Seconly, this film should be used an education piece entitled ""How CGI ruins films"". I feel sorry for the actors having to deal with so much CGI that ultimately detracts from the movie and pales in comparison to the effects used by the 1990 version. It feels like creativity in film is being ruined because the go to solution to anything is to ""we can fix that in post"".Thirdly, the feel of the film is massively off. The original felt like a dark but comedic cautionary tale. This one feels in your face, bright as heck, not dark and not comedic. They try and be comedic in a very slapstick way that is typical of American films trying to pander to young children. It's a sanitary mess that completely lost the feel of story.I would sum this up with a message to the directors of this film: Just because you could, doesn't mean you should.",The Witches

I liked the opening section, and Octavia Spencer puts in a great performance as a characterful, strong and kind grandmother.It's the entire middle stretch of the film, taking place at the hotel, which is lacking. Hathaway's Grand High Witch just isn't scary. She's too clownish, over the top and silly. There is no subtlety. No sense of controlled, calculating evil under a sophisticated, disguised surface. The worst section was the conference room scene. In the original, it was suspenseful and scary. There's no suspence in this new version, it moves very quickly, and the over the top CGI is very off-putting. The reveal of the witches true appearance happens within seconds. Bruno's arrival and transformation is similarly rushed, there's no build-up as he slowly realises he's walked into danger and that he's the of a joke but doesn't know what it is yet.I'm sure children may enjoy this version, and maybe that's all I that matters, but I think the 1990 version is far superior in its writing, performances and effects.",The Witches

921,angelicacarlstedt,What's the point,3,1 December 2020,What is the point of doing a remake of a movie based on a book if you are not going to follow the book??!!,The Witches
922,fsl-48614,Simply entertaining,10,23 October 2020,Loved the movie. Simple breezy movie. The cast was terrific especially Anne Hathaway as the Grand Witch and Octavia Spencer as the grandmother.A must watch.,The Witches
923,gamerworldx-41570,Terrible rework,1,14 November 2020,No originality.. same story as the original with terrible CGI. seems like Hollywood ran out of good ideas for movies.,The Witches
924,adrianbruns-53714,I had some bad news...,1,31 October 2020,"I was so excited to watch this with my Daugjhter because I was such a fan of the original as a little girl, and, let's face it...Anne Hathaway and Octavia Spencer are always pure gold, but this was terrible and awful and horrible. Don't waste your time...just watch the original and be thankful that you were warned about it.",The Witches
925,maschnee,Fun new take on a few great movie!,8,28 October 2021,"While I will always love the fever dream that is the original Witches, this was a really cool take on the subject. It felt new. I especially liked the new creature design that they gave the witches and the fact that they didn't feel the need for a storybook ending. It was unique and didn't take anything away from the earlier film. We totally enjoyed it!",The Witches
926,tim-samedov,Bad movie,1,25 November 2020,This movie is bad and the cgi made me want to hang myself,The Witches
927,alimuzamil-44336,They ruined it! Why oh why?!,1,23 October 2020,This was one of my favorite stories growing up. The old movie was not the best but good enough for the technology they had back then. I always dreamed of them remaking it! But lo and behold this was terrible. Everyones acting sucked and there was no good direction nor good effects. The cgi of the old film was actually better. Ahh they ruined it for me! Please don't pay to watch this movie.,The Witches
928,cera_darrah,Not dissapointed,10,22 October 2020,"Anne Hathaway did amazing as the grand high witch, she was both creepy and funny. Loved the little end credit scene. Also, Octavia Spencer is awesome in everything she does.",The Witches
929,louisjbasilone,A Dishonor,1,26 October 2020,"Just as bad as Cats. Art direction color and cinematography are just not enough for a story. I was really excited about seeing this diversly casted remake and was completely disappointed. I made it to about 35 minutes into the film before I had to find another movie to watch. It's missing the flow, correct casting and magic from the original.",The Witches
930,ghewson,Terrible,3,25 October 2020,"No heart, no soul, nothing good to say about this at all really. No impressive performances to speak of. 3 stars is generous. I'd rather watch the original again than have to sit through this tripe.",The Witches
931,dylangolden-44196,This movie is fine,7,24 October 2020,"First thing I would like to make clear is that it is not a remake of the movie, but another adaptation of the book. In no way shape or form are they trying to be the 90s movie. That being said I really enjoyed the acting from both Spencer and Hathaway. The child actors were child actors so mileage always varies with them. Another thing to keep in mind is that this is a children's movie geared toward children so people old enough to have fond memories of the original when it came out are well outside the age range for this one. Again that being said I found it to be perfectly pleasant. I won't lie and say it was a perfect 10, but does every movie have to be a perfect 10. Can't we all just enjoy the movie without trying to hold it to some standard it was never meant to be judged by?",The Witches
932,missmawwy-1,What is with the hate?,7,25 October 2020,"Form your own opinion of this movie, but all of the 1 star ratings here are wild to me. Obviously people don't understand the purpose of stylized CGI, which is exactly what was used here. It's meant to look ""cartoonish"" - they're freaking talking mice! I thought the relocation to Alabama was fine, and didn't detract from the plot - the lore of witches can exist everywhere. I *understand* the book takes place in England (and Norway), because that's where Roald Dahl is from. Have some tolerance for an artistic change here, people! Overall I found the witches to be WAY creepier, far more villainous. The changes didn't deter from the plot for me, the ending stayed far truer to the book than the 1990 version. Anne Hathaway did justice to the Grand High Witch. That doesn't mean that Anjelica Huston isn't still absolutely iconic in the role. Was it as good? No. Was it a good adaptation that had its merit? Yes. Worth a watch. Form your own opinions and don't let the aggressive reviews here deter you.",The Witches
