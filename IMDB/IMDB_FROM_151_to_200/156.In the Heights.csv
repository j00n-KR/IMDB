0,SnoopyStyle,Dreams,7,24 September 2021,"On a beach, Usnavi (Anthony Ramos) tells a group of youngsters about a place called Washington Heights in the faraway Nueva York. It's the days before the 1999 blackout. Usnavi runs a bodega but dreams of returning to his childhood home of Dominican Republic. He has a crush on the beautiful Vanessa (Melissa Barrera) who dreams of being a fashion designer. Nina returns from Stanford and is unwilling to go back especially if her father Kevin Rosario (Jimmy Smits) has to sell off his business to pay the tuition.It's a Lin-Manuel Miranda musical directed by Jon M. Chu. I really loved some of this. It is too long and probably has too many story elements. The two main young couples could be combined into a simpler single Romeo and Juliet romance. It would allow the DACA story to have more space to breathe. Despite all the hot young things, the most emotional song is Abuela's powerful life story. I do like the visual of Vanessa running down the empty street with the fabrics flowing down the buildings. I don't know if it's possible but Vanessa may be too beautiful. I would have liked for Nina's college drama to be shown. The emotional climax is really Abuela's song and the DACA protest. The movie drags on a bit long after that although that is a fine ending. The main theme of this movie is dream which does present a minor problem. By itself, it does not give that much kinetic energy to the story. Everybody is just pining for money (from the lotto) to make their dreams come to life. All in all, I love quite a bit of this even if it is long.",In the Heights
1,boblipton,The Heights And Depths,6,20 June 2021,"It 's a big, sprawling movie about a Hispanic block in upper Manhattan's Washington Heights, and how each of them has his or her own dream, most of which are some variation of getting out of Washington Heights. It's a steady, dependable sort of multi-generational plot that was paying Fanny Hurst's bills more than a century ago, the stories and dreams seem well told, even if there are too may of them to keep in your head when we return to a particular character. It's also a musical, the one that Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote and directed and starred in to make his bones. John Chu has taken over the direction and Anthony Ramos the role.There's some handsome, if not original choreography in this movie, bits lifted from WEST SIDE STORY and ROYAL WEDDING. It follows the tendency to make a big production number out of every dance. Until the next to last one, I experienced the despair I so often feel looking at modern movie musicals, convinced they've forgotten how to move the camera, but instead cut, cut, cut. The last dance, however, showed they hadn't. They just would rather do a zip cut than plan out the complex movements.Sigh. Still, the songs were surprisingly strong, particularly ""Paciencia Y Fe"", sung by Olga Merediz. It's a skilled and enthusiastic cast, and it makes me hope that Hollywood will go back to making musicals, that are more than Broadway musicals filmed in front of a proscenium arch.",In the Heights
2,lee_eisenberg,"And oh, what heights we'll hit...on with the show, this is it!",9,14 June 2021,"I first heard of Lin-Manuel Miranda when his ""Hamilton"" made a splash. I was surprised to learn that he had written another musical a few years earlier. Well, the movie adaptation of ""In the Heights"" is here. What a show! Basically, it's a look at the efforts to preserve the spirit of one's neighborhood amid pressure to change both from inside and out. The musical numbers are like nothing that you've ever seen. I'll be eager to see Miranda's next production.Great one.",In the Heights
3,jboothmillard,In the Heights,7,25 June 2021,"I was debating about this movie, but after hearing about it receiving very positive reviews, I gave it a chance, based on the Broadway musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton) and Quiara Alegría Hudes, directed by Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D, Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians). Basically, Usnavi de la Vega (Anthony Ramos), named after an American vessel saying ""U. S. Navy"", tells his story to a group of children about his time in Washington Heights, New York. Years earlier, Usnavi is the owner of a neighbourhood bodega (convenience store). He introduces: Abuela Claudia (Olga Merediz), the neighbourhood matriarch and woman who raised him after the death of his parents; Kevin Rosario (Jimmy Smits), who runs a taxi company; Kevin's employee Benny (Corey Hawkins); the salon ladies Daniela (Daphne Rubin-Vega), Carla (Stephanie Beatriz), and Cuca (Dascha Polanco); Usnavi's unrequited crush Vanessa (Melissa Barrera); and his cousin Sonny (Gregory Diaz IV) (""In the Heights""). Attorney and family friend Alejandro (Mateo Gómez) informs Usnavi his late father's business in the Dominican Republic, which he dreams of reviving, is for sale. Meanwhile, Kevin's daughter Nina (Leslie Grace) has returned from Stanford University. After seeing Benny (""Benny's Dispatch""), she finds her father, she tries to tell him she cannot pay tuition, but he ignores her, telling her not to worry (""Breathe""). Daniela is moving her salon to the Bronx due to rent going up. Nina arrives for a treatment, but reveals she has dropped out of Stanford, and leaves (""No Me Diga""). Vanessa dreams of becoming a fashion designer, but her downtown rental application is rejected (""It Won't Be Long Now""). She heads to Usnavi's shop, where Sonny asks her out for him. The results of a lottery, with a $96,000 prize, has been announced, and Sonny learns that the winner bought the ticket from the bodega. At the public swimming pool, everybody in the neighbourhood fantasises about what they would do with the money (""96,000""), while Piragüero, the (ice lollies) Piragua Guy (Lin-Manuel Miranda) laments how he has lost business to a Mister Softee ice cream truck (""Piragua""). That weekend, Benny and Nina reminisce about their childhoods. She expresses her doubts and fears, but he reassures her she is destined for greatness (""When You're Home""). Meanwhile, Usnavi talks to Sonny's father about Sonny coming with him to the Dominican Republic, but Sonny's father implies he and Sonny are undocumented immigrants and cannot leave. That evening, Kevin reveals he sold his business to pay for Nina's tuition. But she is outraged, refuses the money and storms out. Usnavi and Vanessa head to the salsa club for their date, with Benny and Nina. At the club, Usnavi is nervous and declines a dance with Vanessa. A man steals her away for a dance, allowing multiple men to dance with her. Wanting to make Vanessa jealous, Usnavi dances with another woman (""The Club""). Then there is a neighbourhood power cut, and Sonny and Graffiti Pete (Noah Catala) light up fireworks, illuminating the neighbourhood. Vanessa and Usnavi argue, and she rejects him (""Blackout""). Meanwhile, Abuela lies in bed reminiscing about her childhood in Cuba, and how she came to New York, enduring hardships to be where she is today (""Paciencia y Fe""). She dies that night, and the neighbourhood gather to mourn and sing her praises (""Alabanza""). At a protest for DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an immigration policy), Sonny learns that he cannot go to college, as he is an undocumented immigrant. Learning this, Nina resolves to go back to Stanford to help him and other undocumented immigrant children. Usnavi finds Vanessa's rental application in the trash and goes to Daniela to ask her to co-sign it. Disappointed with the block's negativity over the blackout and Abuela's death, Daniela rouses the neighbourhood into a celebration (""Carnaval del Barrio""). The blackout ends at the moment the song concludes. A month later, Nina is about to return to Stanford. Benny promises to find a way to join her in Palo Alto, and they kiss (""When the Sun Goes Down""). As Usnavi prepares to leave for the Dominican Republic, he discovers that Abuela had the winning lottery ticket, and left it to him. Vanessa arrives with champagne, having found out that Usnavi got Daniela to co-sign on her lease. He refuses when she suggests staying, she kisses him, and confesses her feelings for him, although it is too late (""Champagne""). After leaving, Vanessa sees a number of paint drip sheets on the ground that Pete does not need, she is inspired to use them for clothing material and asks to take them. Usnavi gives Alejandro the lottery ticket to use to pay for Sonny's DACA fees. Later, Vanessa takes Usnavi to the bodega and shows him a fashion line she created the previous night from the sheets. Seeing Pete's mural in the store, celebrating Abuela, Usnavi decides to stay. The story returns to the present day, where Usnavi is not on a beach in the Dominican Republic, he is telling his story in the remodelled bodega, and one of the children is Usnavi and Vanessa's daughter. They sing and dance in the street (""Finale""). In a post-credits scene, the Mister Softee truck breaks down and the Piragüero celebrates his victory by raising his prices (""Piragua (Reprise)""). Also starring Marc Anthony as Gapo, Patrick Page as Pike Phillips, Olivia Perez as Iris, Analia Gomez as Rosa, Dean Scott Vazquez as Sedo and Mason Vazquez as Miggy. The cast of predominantly Latino stars all get their moments in the spotlight, it is a little long but a nice simple story, the use of colour and costume looks terrific, many of the songs are catchy, and the choreography is stupendous, especially the inventive dance sequence on the side of the apartment building, overall, a worthwhile musical drama. Very good!",In the Heights
4,preppy-3,I wanted to love this but couldn't,6,21 June 2021,Musical about a bunch of latinos trying to make it in Washington Heights NY. All the songs were great! Everybody could sing and the dancing was incredible full of energy and color. A big production number at a community pool is a jaw-dropper! However there were two big issues--it's too long at 2 1/2 hours and the two leads can't act. Their singing and dancing was great but str8 acting didn't work. That really lessens the film as a whole. So I sort of liked it.,In the Heights
5,ksf-2,inspiring the next generation,7,3 August 2021,"Another Lin Manel project! So there will be singing. Lots of it! Mostly rapping. Here's what i know about it. I was thinking it was meant for kids, until he said up s**** creek, and sh** in both english and spanish. And another spanish word i used to use, until my mexican friends told me not to say that. Much spanglish. The characters keep saying nouns in spanish... i know a fair amount of spanish, but i missed many words, and they aren't translated in the captions, which i had turned on, just in case. The whole story is a flashback, much discussion about ""the dreamers"", the immigrants. And starting your own business. It's long .. 2.5 hrs ! As of today, only 400 votes on imdb. I don't trust their ratings until it has about 1000. The story is solid. Our main character is getting ready to leave town, but things keep pulling him to stay. And oh, the good ol days, when they remember this business on this corner, and life was hard, but we were happier. A clever song about some latino greats, but i'd be surprised if the younger crowd knows who they were... there are some pretty old references. But i guess L-M is trying to change that. Directed by Jon Chu, who had also done crazy rich asians.",In the Heights
6,cherold,Delightful,8,3 October 2021,"Surprisingly old-fashioned musical with little plot and some big, imaginative dance numbers. The cast is charming, the songs are quick and clever, and there's a wonderful sense of place.In a world in which the movie musical, is often, like The Greatest Showman, aggressively modern in its music and overwrought in its performance, the loveliness of In the Heights cannot be overstated. You should watch it.",In the Heights
7,ThomasDrufke,"Not For Me, But 96,000 is a Hit",6,6 July 2021,"Knowing that Hamilton wasn't necessarily my jam last summer, I was hopeful but hesitant about In the Heights. While I think the big screen, to showcase set pieces and big musical numbers, is a much better way to show off Lin-Manuel Miranda's talents, I still found myself complaining about the runtime, uninterested in a few plot points, and wanting more with a few of the numbers. But most people will have a great time with this one.6.6/10.",In the Heights
8,Cineanalyst,Hamiltonian,7,10 June 2021,"Not that ""Hamilton"" (the musical turned canned theatre on Disney+ from 2020), at least not entirely, which, besides, came after Lin-Manuel Miranda's collaboration on the stage musical, now, made into a movie, ""In the Heights."" They do, however, contain a similar-sounding blend of popular music and the usual musical theatre, which in both cases is felicitous to the diverse American stories--the historical founding of the nation of and by immigrants in ""Hamilton"" and the modern multicultural (and multilingual) American Dream and undocumented Dreamers here (and, by the way, I love the wordplay--even the ""power"" stuff). Anyways, the Hamilton I'm evoking is the mathematician, not the politician--William Rowan Hamilton, not Alexander Hamilton. And, to get the obvious questions that raises out of the way: yes, rhyming Hamilton with Hamilton is about as much poetry as I'm capable of--I'm not Miranda--and, yes, I'm mathematically illiterate and so will undoubtedly be annihilating this analogy. I'd like to pretend there's a symmetry here between the dotted subway routes mapped out in the movie, the meter of the lyrics, or the plot paths of the characters' dreams, but I don't know.So, simply put, my point is to compare the filmed ""Hamilton"" to that of ""In the Heights."" To my understanding, Lagrangian mechanics may best apply to ""Hamilton,"" as it takes the simplest path from stage to screen. It's just about capturing the energy of the play and so was filmed on the stage, in a theatre, aided by only slight cinematic momentum in montage or shot changes and camera positions beyond a seat at the proscenium arch. ""In the Heights,"" however, is a full-fledged cinematic adaptation. Its release was even delayed during the pandemic so that it could premiere in cinemas as well as streaming; not the case with ""Hamilton."" In mathematician Hamiltonian speak, that's the kinetic energy of the play plus the potential energy offered by movies. More Hamiltonian than ""Hamilton.""Whether Hamiltonian as opposed to Lagrangian mechanics in ""In the Heights"" and ""Hamilton"" is reflected in cinemetrics (the collection from films of statistics such as average shot length), about the only numerical measurement of motion one learns from film studies, has as far as I know yet to be demonstrated. But, to paraphrase from the other Hamilton's frenemy, the truth that ""In the Heights"" is more cinematic in a Hamiltonian sense is self-evident. Even though it's limited by its source to its Washington Heights neighborhood, the art form of cinema allows it to in a sense dream bigger, or at the very least differently. Thus, more extras singing in unison, more intricate settings, camera positions unrestrained by fourth walls and ultimately the real walls of a theatre. The perspective between a swooping wide view of the entire chorus and an intimate close-up of a lead may be completed seamlessly.Narratively, this is standard dual-focus, with a common subplot of a secondary romance, which is so common in movie musicals that Rick Altman literally wrote the book on it, ""The American Film Musical."" This sort of integrated musical has existed at least since ""The Love Parade"" (1929). Moreover, musicals are inherently reflexive whether backstage, with their shows-within-a-show, or integrated, as here, because of the unreality of normal people breaking out in song and dance during their daily lives, although this one adds to this the framing device of the story being told within the story, and he's furthermore in love with an artist, a fashion designer. Most of that could just as well be done on stage (theoretically, that is, as I didn't see the play). Maybe that's why I think the secondary romance here is ultimately the more affecting one and which leads to the picture's pinnacle moment where they dance on the walls. That's pure Busby Berkeley geometry, fantastical Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers symmetry there. It doesn't require an equation to figure out that much.",In the Heights
9,cricketbat,"Good enough, but I'm glad Lin-Manuel Miranda's work has improved since this",6,14 June 2021,"I was excited to see In the Heights. I've never seen this production on stage, but I am a fan of Lin-Manuel Miranda's work on Hamilton and Moana. It's kind of obvious this musical came before those two, as it feels more amateurish. The songs are enjoyable in the moment but aren't very memorable and go on a little long. Plus, the story doesn't have enough dramatic tension. I'm glad Lin-Manuel Miranda finally got his first Broadway musical to the screen, but I'm also glad his work has improved since then.",In the Heights
10,Thanos_Alfie,Beautiful but too long...,7,19 June 2021,"""In the Heights"" is a Musical - Drama movie in which is based on a Broadway musical where a bodega owner in New York trying to save as much money as he can in order to accomplish a dream of his. Everybody knows him and he also knows them since he is very sympathetic and polite.I liked this movie because it had a simple but beautiful and interesting plot. The music and the songs of the musical were also very good and listening to them, it was like you were there with them. The only thing I would change it would be the duration of it because for me it was too long. The interpretations of Anthony Ramos who played as Usnavi and Melissa Barrera who played as Vanessa were very good and their combination worked very well. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Leslie Grace who played as Nina Rosario, Olga Merediz who played as Abuela Claudia and Gregory Diaz IV who played as Sonny. Lastly, I have to say that ""In the Heights"" is a nice, beautiful musical and I highly recommend you to watch it because I am sure that you will like it and you will enjoy it.",In the Heights

12,eddie_baggins,A whimsical film arriving at the perfect time in the world,8,15 June 2021,"Arriving into a world that hasn't had a whole lot of joy and happiness shared around over the previous 12 months, Broadway musical adaptation In the Heights drops into a time and place where its dosage of colour, energy and Hollywoodized views of life where everyone is friends and loved up couples can dance along the side of a building in gravity defying displays arrives in what's a case of perfect timing for all concerned.A passion project for Hamilton heavyweight Lin-Manuel Miranda who has helped bring this musical to life on the big screen as both a producer, consultant and supporting star, Heights is vividly bought to life by the Broadway star and hot right now director Jon M. Chu, who on the back of his work with Crazy Rich Asians and this film here has showcased a real ability to craft culturally diverse products for a landscape crying out for more variety in the media they consume.There's no true plot holding everything in Heights together and not a single villain to lay your eyes on (unless you count the neighborhood's newest dry-cleaner and his exorbitant prices) and at 140 minutes in runtime there's a case to be made for this tale benefiting from a further trim in the editing suite but Chu and Miranda ensure this heart-felt and upscale Hallmark offering is a film impossible to hate as we as an audience are invited to a block party we can't help but be glad we made the effort to attend.Built around Anthony Ramos's Usnavi (a star making turn for the young performer), a corner store grocery manager with dreams of escaping the neighborhood of Washington Heights to return to his home country of the Dominican Republic but torn due to his love of fellow Washington Heights resident Vanessa (another star making turn from actress Melissa Barrera), Heights throws countless musical numbers at us thick and fast and while some of the numbers are a little underwhelming, when Heights hits the high notes there aren't many modern day musicals that could stand alongside it and Chu and Miranda should be commended for embedding their creative feature with heart, soul and fun to spare creating an often magical movie going experience.Opening with an extended entrée to the main course that Hamilton fans will be pleased too know takes the same hip-hop inspired approach to song and dance numbers that made Miranda's work such a talk-worthy exercise, Heights is rarely too far away from another eye-popping set piece that will have your feet tapping and your heart beating and whether the film is taking us on a sojourn to the local swimming pool, walks through the streets with nothing more than fireworks lighting the way or showcasing the local battle of wits between a shaved ice salesman and the local ice cream truck, there's a lot too love here and while cynics will find lots to pull apart and find issue with, its hard to imagine how one could not find joy in such a whimsical ride.Accessible to those of varied age, background or race, Heights is going to be a film that is oft-enjoyed for the years yet to come and while its not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, right here and now this fun and exciting bout of goodness and goodwill arrives at the perfect time.Final Say -A fun and enthusiastic Hollywood musical with a great ethnic twist, In the Heights may outstay its welcome in parts and feature a few song and dance routines that could've been cut without issue but as a whole this is a joyous movie going event that showcases what big screen magic is all about.4 lottery tickets out of 5.",In the Heights
13,SAMTHEBESTEST,Another surprising Classic Musical adaption after 'Hamilton'. Forget overhyped 'Chicago' and 'La La Land' and enjoy a Real Musical Carnival.,8,11 June 2021,"In The Heights (2021) :
Movie Review -In this millennium two of those most popular Musicals were oscar winning 'Chicago' (2002) and 'La La Land' (2016). Chicago still had prime musicals to remember with enough intelligence in the choreography but La La Land was below par in everything. Remember that opening number in La La Land? It was so fascinating but did we see any such number in rest of the film? Forget great, did we even see any good or decent musical number with excellent choreography? No. Eventually, the film lacked the essential touch too so i don't really understand why people have overhyped it so much. I mean i am fan of those Classic Musicals of Hollywood which have great musicals and fine storyline too. Just to name a few i would say, 'The Wizard Of OZ', 'Singin In The Rain', 'West Side Story', 'Sounf Of Music' etc. To be frank, that golden era of Musicals has been gone since years and expecting the same stuff Today is a very expensive demand. The audience who have overhyped Chicago and La La Land must have been unaware of those classic musicals so it's okay if they liked it too much. For me, Chicago was fine and La La Land was mediocre and digested it quickly because i knew that those golden days are not gonna come back. Suddenly, there was something astonishing like 'Hamilton' hit the digital platforms and i was stunned to see a groundbreaking Musical in today's time. The reason i mentioned Hamilton is, it was a Broadway phenomena, which unfortunately couldn't hit the theatres so had its original presentation and In The Heights came as a feature film adaption of a Musical Play. In the Heights is as amazing as Hamilton at almost many levels and even though it doesn't match the final level of Hamilton, it finishes off very close to it which is a big achievement anyway.The story is set over the course of three days, involving characters in the largely Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights in New York City. In the beginning there was a mention of 'Blackout' and i was like, what is that? Chuck it, let's enjoy the tappy numbers and creatively designed choreography. Till the interval point I even forgot that Blackout mention but finally it hit, and what a tremendous impact it had. It divides the narrative in two parts, before blackout and after Blackout..well, that's how you create a linear equation of storytelling. Not a single moment where you'll get bored, it has such an amusing atmosphere to keep you grooving on it. I was grinning constantly and was tapping my foot on the ground throughout those 140 minutes. I don't even remember when I did the same thing for any Musical made after 70s in Hollywood. That's the bigger achivement for the team of In The Heights.In the Heights has good performances of all the artists. It could been better though, i mean that intensity was slightly less. Cinematography, story, art designing, choreography, musicals, lyrics, production value all these things will surpass your expectations even if you have some high. I wasn't expecting anything great so for me it was all like a Big Pleasant Surprise! Miranda's original version is adopted very well by Jon Chu. The main credit goes to Miranda of course, but the Cinematic evaluation and its merits belongs to Jon Chu only. Overall, if you are a matured cine-viewer who understand the quality musicals with brainstorming choreography (not the one who calls La La Land and Chicago Classics) then In The Heights is an entertaining and amusing carnival for you. Don't miss it and kindly use subtitles to understand Spanish lyrics.RATING - 8/10*",In the Heights
14,matthewssilverhammer,The first real post-pandemic masterpiece.,10,6 July 2021,"A celebration of the crucial mundanity we miss when we're focused on our dreams. A love letter that makes you nostalgic for a place you've never been. A story of Home that anyone can relate to, but particularly the immigrant/displaced community. A film that leads you dancing (metaphorically or literally) out of the theater on an emotional high, ready to love & engage with your community. A stunning achievement in every way & the perfect 2021 salve.",In the Heights
15,paul-allaer,Wonderful movie is just what the doctor ordered to start this summer,8,11 June 2021,"As ""In The Heights"" (2021 release; 143 min.) opens, we are introduced to Usnavi, who is getting ready for a new day at the convenience store that he runs in Washington Heights. It is ""3 Days till Blackout"" and neighborhood people are stopping by (mostly for coffee). Usnavi is originally from the Dominican Republic and dreams of going back and rebuild his parents' house that was destroyed by a hurricane. We then get to know Nina, who has just finished her freshman year at Stanford and she feels dejected about her experience there. Then there is Vanessa, who works at a beauty parlor but hopes to start her own fashion line... At this point we are 15 min. Into the movie.Couple of comments: ""At the Heights"" is the highly anticipated big screen adaptation of the Broadway play from creator Lin-Manuel ""Hamilton"" Miranda. Let me state upfront that I have not seen the Broadway show so I cannot comment on how closely the film sticks to the original play. What I can say is this: the film is an absolute wonderful experience from start to finish. The story line works well. Most of the songs are immediately appealing singalongs. And then there is the dancing: there are several utterly stunning dancing sequences (the 10 min. Sequence at the pool with hundreds of extras while singing to ""96,000""; the gravity-defying sequence by Kevin and Nina on the side of the apartment building; etc.). And yes, there are also time-defining reminders of the ""Dreamers"", DACA, and being visible. In fact, I'd say that ""In The Heights"" is a celebration of not just music and dance, but also diversity, inclusion, equality, respect and encouragement. So that makes ""In the Heights"" not only a wildly entertaining movie but also a deeply political statement, and one that will not be welcomed by the MAGA crowd. As a legal immigrant myself to this country (I arrived here from Belgium in the early 80s), I found ""In The Heights"" to be refreshing and above all super-entertaining. These 2 1/2 hours flew by in no time.""In The Heights"" was originally scheduled to be released in theaters in Jun, 2020, but of course a little thing called COVID-19 had different plans. Fast forward a year later, and the movie was finally released this weekend and it also is available for streaming on HBO Max (which is where I caught this last night). As we all move closer to 'normalcy' with each passing day and week, ""In The Heights"" is a wonderful movie and just what the doctor ordered to start making the summer of 2021 a summer to remember. Enjoy!",In the Heights
16,Turfseer,Poor man's West Side Story in which great music and dancing can't save mediocre storyline,5,19 June 2021,"I saw In The Heights when it was a musical on Broadway years ago and had the same reaction to it after coming out of the movie theater. Basically I wasn't thrilled despite some great musical numbers, nifty lyrics and some unbelievably great choreography (featuring a humongous group of dancers in the film version!) The film has the added bonus of featuring the show's creator, the extremely likable Lin-Manuel Miranda, as Piragüero, the Piragua Guy, getting his comeuppance on a Mister Softee franchisee, while selling his wares on the street.In the Heights aspires to be modern day update of West Side Story. Both deal at least in part with young people and Hispanic culture in New York City. The latter set in the area behind where Lincoln Center is now and the former in Washington Heights (upper, upper westside Manhattan).Unlike West Side Story, there is no central antagonist to sink your teeth into here-nor are the stakes very high in contrast to the life and death machinations of the characters in West Side Story. The principal story here revolves around the oddly named Usnavi de la Vega (Anthony Ramos), who dreams of refurbishing his father's business, leveled by a hurricane in the Dominican Republic. Usnavi is conflicted about selling his bodega and abandoning his community in Washington Heights by moving down to DR. In addition, he's taking care of his teenage cousin, Sonny, who's here illegally and must obtain a green card so he can work out his dream of getting ahead.The other significant principal here is Nina (Leslie Grace), daughter of Kevin Rosario (Jimmy Smits) who owns a local taxi dispatch company. The big conflict here is Nina's decision not to return to Stanford to complete her studies there much to the chagrin of Kevin, who wants to pay the rest of the tuition (but doesn't really have the money to do so).Usnavi's love interest is Vanessa (Melissa Barrera) who also has a surfeit of dreams including becoming a successful fashion designer.A good deal of the plot ends up centering on a winning ""Take Five"" ticket worth $96,000 (the name of one of the songs), which the aging community matriarch ""Abuela"" (Olga Merediz) wills to Usnavi following her death due to a heart attack (there's a big number in which the community mourns her death).In the Heights suffers from some predictable sentimentality in which there's a happy ending for all the principals including Sonny, who Usnavi establishes a trust fund for using Abuela's lottery winnings along with hiring a lawyer to attempt to obtain a green card for the teenager turned clever rapper wordsmith. Usnavi also convinces Daniela (Daphne Rubin-Vega), the recently moved salon owner to co-sign a rental agreement so that Vanessa can open up her own shop. Nina finally decides to go back to Stanford making her dad happy.Usnavi decides to stay in Washington Heights after seeing murals of Abuela around the neighborhood. One wonders how he planned to move to the Dominican Republic since the bodega had not been sold on the day he was supposed to depart.Go see In the Heights for the music and the dancing and forget about the thin storyline which unfortunately will not bowl you over.",In the Heights

The scenery becomes a character itself, feeling the beauty of being in the heights. The actors don't disappoint either, really get there roles so well, I forget I'm watching a movie.If you love musicals then give In The Heights a look.",In the Heights
18,stevendbeard,Not My Favorite Type of Movie,7,28 June 2021,"I saw ""In the Heights"", starring Anthony Ramos-Honest Thief, Godzilla:King of the Monsters; Corey Hawkins-Kong:Skull Island, Iron Man 3; Leslie Grace-her first movie; Melissa Barrera-Vida_tv, Perseguidos_tv and Jimmy Smits-How to Get Away With Murder_tv, the Star Wars movies.This is a musical-not my favorite type of movie-that is based on a Broadway musical that was the brainchild of Lin_Manuel Miranda. With his track record, you know he knows what he is doing-as far as musicals go, anyways-and he does have a few cameo scenes where he is selling his wares on the streets. He wrote the music and lyrics. There are several stories taking place but the main one is about a store owner, Anthony, living in Washington Heights New York that dreams of saving enough money to move back to the Dominican Republic. Melissa plays the girl he likes but he is too shy to ask her out. Corey is Anthony's friend that likes Leslie, who has been away at college and just got back into town. Jimmy plays Leslie's father that scraped and saved money to send her to college but discovers that she may not be happy at school. There are lots of great choreography concerning the dance moves and everyone sings their hearts out-as to be expected in a musical-so if you like musicals, you should enjoy this one. If you stay after the end credits, Lin_Manuel has a little scene with an ice cream vendor.It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and has a running time of 2 hours & 23 minutes.As I said earlier, musicals are not my favorite type of movie so I don't think I would buy this one on DVD.

The storyline focuses on Washington Heights in New York City where everyone has goals and dreams but the struggle is real and the need for funds is even more real. When news breaks that someone in Washington Heights won the lottery, some's dream is going to come true. This movie is directed by Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asian) and stars Anthony Ramos (A Star is Born), Melissa Barrera (upcoming Scream Remake), Corey Hawkins (Straight Outta Compton) and Jimmy Smits (Dexter). The storyline for this is outstanding. This is a little long but is so intricate and well done. Every character's story and back story is well told. The singing is also out of this world, well thought-out and well written. I really enjoyed the evolution of all the characters throughout the movie and the ultimate conclusions. They also do a great job with the choreography that perfectly fits the ups and downs of the emotional swings throughout the storyline.

Chu (Crazy Rich Asians, a couple of the Step Up films) w/Miranda now relegated to a smaller role as a piragua (flavored snow cones) vendor letting his Hamilton co-star Anthony Ramos take the lead as a Dominican American named Usnavi about to return back to the DR to live his dream (& his father's) of renovating their beachfront bar. He hopes to take a cousin (who's a dreamer whose status is in limbo) w/him & maybe the neighborhood abuela who is not a blood kin but has been such a staple of the barrio, everyone accepts her role. Into this mix is the specter of gentrification as small businesses are disappearing (a salon, run by Rent alum Daphne Rubin-Vega, is moving further uptown & a halved livery service, run by Jimmy Smits, is considering selling the full business to his dry cleaner neighbor since he's gotten news his daughter, played by Leslie Grace, has decided not to return to Stamford due to tuition woes). What will the barrio do? Take that money & move elsewhere or stay & fight a battle which in time may still be lost? Did I mention there were songs & dancing as well? Yes it is a potent & busy stew but a wonderful one at that coming from a life long Latino is this great metropolitan area & while some of the life experiences may not mirror my own, there is enough desired baggage for anyone who has an accent to their speech to embrace. Also starring Corey Hawkins (from Straight Outta Compton) as a manager working for Smits who carries a torch for Grace, Olga Merediz (reprising her role from the B'way show) as the abuela, Stephanie Beatriz (from Brooklyn Nine-Nine) as an employee working for Vega & a certain ex-husband of JLo's showing up as Ramos' uncle.",In the Heights

It's visually really enjoyable but I didn't connect to any of these characters. That said, I love that this doesn't try to pander and fill in a bunch of different demographics. It's all about the community and it sticks to it.Thinking back on it, I think I respect it more than I liked it.

27,jadepietro,High Times,9,16 June 2021,"IN BRIEF: Despite an uneven book with a sentimental streak, a vibrant cast imbues life in this buoyant musical treat.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Dreams. They are the main incentive that spur on the residents of Washington Heights, a microcosm of immigrants who dream of a better life in NYC. And Jon M. Chu's vivid film adaptation of Lin Manuel Miranda's Broadway musical, In the Heights, is a winner.The story revolves around the community and its people. Usnavi de la Vega (a very winning Anthony Ramos) who owns the neighborhood's popular bodega, dreams about returning to his native land in the Dominican Republic to escape the gentrification of his city, although he pines for Vanessa (Melissa Barrera) who dreams of being a fashion designer. Usnavi's best friend, Benny (Corey Hawkins) loves Nina (Leslie Grace), who is disillusioned with the white privilege at Stanford University and has returned home. Meanwhile, Sonny (Gregory Diaz IV) hides his undocumented status with dreams of entering college. Taking on the adult supervision is Nina's father, Kevin (Jimmy Smits) and the matriarch of the block, Abuela Claudia (a scene-stealing Olga Merediz). Soon they all hear about a winning lottery ticket for $96,000 won by someone in their neighborhood and wonder just who is that lucky person.The film celebrates the multi-culture aspects of its community and the pride of its inhabitants with its infectious musical score and many top-notch musical numbers that convey their joy and the sorrow. Mr. Miranda's Latin-influenced Tony-winning score is a mix of hip hop, ballads, and big dazzling production numbers that provide the real excitement.Mr. Chu shot his film on location, providing the gritty urban appeal and he expertly crafts a memorable time. His direction is sharp and heartfelt. He also hones into the musical numbers as homages to past Technicolor musicals, honoring the likes of Busby Berkeley and a gravity-free Fred Astaire in Royal Wedding. (The film's many highlights include the title opening number which effectively introduces all of the characters in song, a delightful lighter-than-air romance ballad, and an Esther Williams tribute later in the film that is a glorious high with its skillful choreography and editing. Kudos to Myron Kerstein and Christopher Scott, respectively.) The director makes the difficulty of presenting a big Hollywood musical seem effortless. The camerawork by helps immensely as its swoops down and around to immerse the moviegoing audience in the neighborhood and its sense of wonder.However, just as in the Broadway show, the book lacks focus. There are substantial changes in the screenplay by its original writer, Quiara Alegría Hudes, from his Broadway version which sanitize some issues, particularly the omission of the violent looting of Usnavi's store that served as a catalyst in the stage production. It is as if the filmmakers only wanted to stress the positive karma in its citizenry. However, the current political ramification of illegal immigration and DACA become a moving addition to the film and are handled directly as one of the major plot-line.The cast is splendid. Mr. Ramos is an effervescent joy as Usnavi. Strong support is given by every cast member to make their roles so memorable, with especially fine work delivered by Ms. Grace and Ms. Barrera. But it is the elder Ms. Merediz who is the heart of the film. Her solo number, Paciencia Y Fe, is beautifully rendered. Other famous stars have smaller but pivotal roles such as Daphne Rubin-Vega, Christopher Jackson, Marc Anthony, and Mr. Miranda and they only add to the enjoyment.In the Heights hits the heights. While the storytelling is conventional and earthbound, the music and dance soars. The film is an exuberant and highly entertaining musical that deserves to be seen on the big screen. Simply stated (or sung). It's a dream of a musical! Go see it! (GRADE: B+)",In the Heights

In the Heights is a shining example of Hispanic culture that brings so many emotional moments and powerful numbers into a 150 minute run time. With an adequate cultural representation brought out by a strong acting cast and a setting that welcomes the passion of the culture and music quite well it's a spirited movie with a lot of theater quality components. The well done writing, the use of cinematic magic, and of course many of the song and dance numbers are truly the heart of the film, with enough family elements to allow many to take their young ones to the theater/HBOMax to see it. And yet, the movie feels very jumbled, lacking the planning of the movie and the impasses I like to see to help bring the story full circle. In the Heights has a lot of inconsistencies in terms of focus for many of the characters and plots, going more towards the musical numbers that I think took too much time. It led to a predictable tale that though inspiring is not my favorite of the tales I've seen in this genre. Still, the film is fun and should appease many no matter what avenue you choose to watch this film at. Thus, my scores for this movie are:Drama/Musical: 7.5

Well, your wish has come true and you can have more because In the Heights is now a movie! It has the same great soundtrack and is even more action packed.In the Heights is about Usnavi (Anthony Ramos), a bodega owner, and his disappearing neighborhood in New York City, specifically Washington Heights. Small businesses are moving away; people are leaving; and Usnavi is going back to his home in the Dominican Republic to help his family. What will happen when Usnavi leaves?This movie is based on the book by Quiara Alegria Hudes and musical, with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda - both titled with the same name. The music is phenomenal and very memorable because it makes you want to get up and dance. While writing this review, I still have all the songs stuck in my head. Lin-Manuel Miranda also plays the Piragua Guy. Along with the music, the choreography is outstanding, particularly the group choreography - a mix of hip-hop and Latinx styles. Everyone is in sync and energetic. The scenes are very detailed, artistic and beautiful, with so much color. The acting is beyond amazing and every character is so believable and loveable. Anthony Ramos, as Usnavi, stands out and seems very genuine. Melissa Barrera, as Vanessa, shows so much perseverance for her dreams. Leslie Grace's Nina is passionate as she deals with her character's conflicts. My favorite character is Abuela Claudia because she is so loving to all, and she reminds us to have paciencia y fe (patience and faith). The characters speak Spanish at times during the film, so it helps if you have some knowledge of the Spanish language, but it's not essential to enjoying the movie.The main message is that sueñitos (little dreams) aren't always easy; you have to work for them. In the Heights addresses some serious topics like attending college and dealing with racial bias as a minority. This movie has some profanity and suggestive references.I give In the Heights 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

32,martimusross,"Instantly Forgettable Music & Movie, I Was Bored!",5,12 June 2021,"In The HeightsIt is difficult to know where to begin with this review as there were just so many problems, in terms of a hit musical it was such an American story containing so many specific things particular to that place that it was just not transferable this side of the pond. It had the feel of a stage show rather than a movie and needed adapting quite differently for it to work, remember that feline monstrosity Cats last year, same problem.There was very little musical variety, we just had exhausting Hispanic rap relentlessly, I didn't know that was a thing, and I can only recall two memorable songs, granny's song and the fiesta, the rest were just instantly forgettable. The vocal variety was also flat the same tricks over and over, this was certainly no Bernstein, Weber or even Disney!The dancing was just mass freneticism, totally lacking any imagination, even the Busby Berkeley tribute didn't work.Now to look more disturbingly at the themes, it was difficult to look beyond these intentional inserts, it just grated at nearly every turn. We had dreadful female objectification, racial stereotyping, tokenism, white shaming and a tick box agenda of political tropes.Lastly the whole plot rested on people having left Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Cuba for real reasons of poverty and danger and yet these same people were desperate to return rather than embracing their new home, and then implying the only way to get on in America is to win the lottery, really quite absurd, I felt cheated!I must say I was so looking forward to this and it sadly disappointed.

Heck, I had flashbacks from the 1977 blackout, but back then few people could afford A/Cs. We had box fans in the windows and hanged out in the stoops to get away from the heat.The message in the musical is inspirational.

35,bob-the-movie-man,Lin-Manuel Miranda's high octane musical is a MUST SEE on the big screen.,8,21 June 2021,"""In the Heights"" follows the hopes and dreams of a group of ordinary but ambitious Latinx youngsters, living their lives as best they can in the poor neighbourhood of Washington Heights in New York. They all have their own 'El Sueñito' - a little dream - of what they want to achieve.Positives:
A ""proper"" musical, with a large percentage of high-octane song and dance numbers.-As with ""Hamilton"", ""In the Heights"" features some truly clever rap-style lyrics - lyrics so clever that you gasp at the way in which they trip off the singer's tongue. At one point, Carla (Stephanie Beatriz) sings ""My mom is Dominican-Cuban, My dad is from Chile and P. R., which means: I'm Chile-...Dominica-Rican! But I always say I'm from Queens!"". Glorious stuff.The dancing is stupendous. The choreography team is led by Christopher Scott, and he joyfully brings back the large set piece dances that we used to see in movies of old. The Esther Williams style swimming routines even make a spectacular return in a glorious Lido sequence (although I could have personally done without the dislocating contortionist dancers here!).The four young people taking the leads are all extremely personable (as well as being very good looking). Anthony Ramos in particular shows real star quality, those mesmeric eyes holding your attention for every moment he's on screen. You get the feeling that Lin-Manuel Miranda (whose superfluous minor role could have usefully ended up on the cutting room floor) was itching to play the lead but was just ""too old man""!It was also great to see a range of roles for older women as well, with the dramatic sequence with Olga Merediz, the neighbourhood saint and guardian Claudia, being a highpoint in the movie for me.Negatives:
When you step back and analyse it, the story is pretty slight. You are distracted from this by all the razzle-dazzle going on, but having a bit more meat on the bone would have been welcome. This is particularly the case, since....At 143 minutes, I have to say that the movie outstayed its welcome for me by about 20 or 30 minutes. If the movie had been tightened up a bit and shortened, it would I think have been much improved.Summary Thoughts on ""In the Heights"": This is a musical for those people who say ""They don't make musicals like that anymore"". High octane and full of noise and colour, its a spectacular that doesn't disappoint. The quirkiness of ""Crazy Rich Asians"" (which Jon M. Chu also directed) is on full display in some of the sequences, which are cleverly filmed. It's a movie that had me periodically grinning, not just at the story or the songs but at the movie craft on show.Is it a bit of an 'Emperor's New Clothes', given the shallowness of the story? Yes, perhaps. And does it laugh in the face of my 90-minute movie ideal? Definitely. But it's still well worth the price of your movie ticket..... and this IS a movie that demands to be watched on the BIG SCREEN to get the full effect.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

38,kjproulx,A Great Musical Filled with Terrific Characters,9,30 June 2021,"When it comes to musicals on film, they ride a very fine line between great and too cheesy for me. For myself, movies like Into the Woods or Rock of Ages seem to be striving for spectacle and star power over substance, which is never the right thing for a film. When looking at films like Singin' in the Rain or West Side Story though, you can tell just as much care went into the story as the music. I'm very happy to say that In the Heights follows that description. Here's why I believe it's one of the better films I've seen in 2021 so far.Usnavi (Anthony Ramos) works day in and day out at a Bodega/Convenience Store in New York with dreams of a better life. The film focuses on the many struggles of others around him as well, but he is the central character. It almost doesn't feel right to focus solely on his character, because everyone is given a moment to shine here. The real-life issues involving friends, family, poverty, aspirations that may not come true, and the tests to see if you have what it takes to do something with your life are all addressed here and I loved every minute of those moments. A great story needs to be the backbone of every musical, but anyone who wishes to see this film will also be hoping for great musical numbers and I don't think they will be disappointed here.In the Heights not only cares about its characters but strives to provide incredible musical performances that are quite memorable. From catchy tunes to raw and authentic monologues, I was sucked into this story from start to finish. In particular, I really enjoyed the on-screen chemistry between Benny (Corey Hawkins) and Nina (Leslie Grace) and their touching moments on the street, as well as a very well-done sequence involving the side of a building. Everyone in the cast is terrific though and a few performances/songs, in particular, brought me to tears since the build-up was so nicely constructed. I found that most of these characters were moving in their own unique way.As far as the direction of the film goes, you can colour me incredibly impressed. Helmed by John M. Chu (G. I. Joe: Retaliation, Step Up 2: The Streets), I never once saw him as someone who would make a film that I would love. I've seen nothing but an improvement from him as a director through the years. Doing some fun scenes with great choreography in the Step Up films and directing some decent action in G. I. Joe: Retaliation, it was really Crazy Rich Asians that put him on the map for me. It wasn't anything like his previous style which made me think he is capable of so much more. Well, In the Heights is easily his best work yet and I think he should be very proud of his work here.Overall, In the Heights does suffer from feeling about 10-20 minutes too long, due to taking the time to flesh out secondary characters, but most of the time it still worked for me. When you break this film down and look at the great cinematography by Alice Brooks, the fantastic direction by John M. Chu, the committed performances by everyone involved, and the emotional backbone to each of the characters involved, I really didn't have much to complain about here. Yes, the movie feels slightly overstuffed in terms of how many stories are being told, but they are all still very well-done. Now available on-demand and in theatres, I absolutely recommend checking out In the Heights, especially if you're a fan of musicals.",In the Heights
39,AhmedSpielberg99,Best Musical since La La Land!,9,15 June 2021,"Seems like the vast majority of the movie reviews I read denounce it for lacking in cohesion, and I simply think they're missing the point. In The Heights plays out like a rhapsody, with each character's storyline thread is given singularity and distinct nature to stand out, yet they're all integrated partly due to the free-flowing structure the movie has as well as its main theme that encompasses the entire story - the classism of gentrification and its impending repercussions. Thus, the story offers a sort of communal experience, that it reflects not only its characters, but the whole block that was ""disappearing."" The story's goings-on spans several days before and after ""the blackout"" amid a scorching summer. It's Washington Heights where everyone chasing their own little dream (or sueñito), hoping one day they finally reach for the heights that seem to be just there over the horizon yet actually no one can see as they're beyond the blinding streetlights of the soon-to-be-gentrified Nueva York. At the centre stage, we have our narrator, Usnavi. A small little corner store (bodega) owner with a dream of returning home to the Dominican Republic, Usnavi also has a longtime crush on Vanessa - a girl in the neighborhood with an artistic talent for fashion designing, working in a beauty salon and dreams of moving downtown. There's also Sonny, Usnavi's younger cousin and sidekick who works with him. On a side note, Lin-Manuel Miranda decision to leave the role of Usnavi, which he originally played, to Anthony Ramos is a really smart one. Ramos gives his character an amiably rogue-ish charm that Miranda would no longer be able to emanate.""So please don't say you're proud of me when I've lost my way.""Nina's storyline, though, is by miles the richest, more compelling and intricately detailed-albeit more conventional-one. Her father had sold half his share in business to pay for her education, only to find out that her daughter dropped out after her freshman year. Nina's story touches on a few interesting topics as it unravels. She grew bitter at the idea of being an outsider and couldn't stand seeing herself through the prejudiced perspective of her colleagues. Her family of first and second-generation immigrants had managed to assimilate with the new culture without losing their identity, ultimately partly seceding themselves to form their own community. But as for her, she experienced some sort of weltschmerz when she discovered that the hurdle of inherent prejudice still exists. She's unwelcomed, and even humiliated and treated as a dodgy person solely because of her ethnicity. What further exacerbates Nina's adversity is the fact she has always been regarded from her father, as well as her whole neighborhood, as the genius kid from whom they anticipated a lot. Even as an undergrad, the small girls in the block look up to her as an inspiration. All that proves a burden to her already self-disparaged self.""Let me listen to the block""All that said, we always see that community standing in solidarity and resilience in the face of their hardships, sustaining their Washington Heights with hectic and lively atmosphere. We get plenty of insert shots that focus on, in the words of Abuela Claudia-the barrio's matriarch, ""the little details that tell the world (they) are not invisible."" Speaking of the character of Abuela, she's basically the heart and soul of the community. She inherited the ""American dream""- that of barely surviving the new environment-from her mother. When she was young, she managed to cope with the challenges she faced on a daily basis. As an old woman, she burnt herself like a candle for illuminating her neighbourhood in ways that seem to surpass the metaphorical sense of the word. Furthermore, the matriarchal power of the neighborhood, in general, lays on the acculturation basis of ""integration"" rather than either ""assimilation"" or ""separation."" As Carla sings, ""My mom is Dominican-Cuban. My dad is from Chile. Which means, I'm Chile-Domini-Curican. But I always say I'm from Queens."" Here we get that they aim to simultaneously adopt the new culture while retaining their heritage proudly.""A dream isn't some sparkly diamond we get. You know, sometimes, it's rough. And it's not so pretty.""On multiple occasions throughout the movie, and especially in the titular musical number, we see the players' movements synchronized with music perfectly. And it's clear there was a painstaking attention given to the choreography of every musical number. Whether they're jumping in the air, splashing water or dancing in the streets, all the players are seen engaged in unison in jubilant celebrations of the potential for realizing their dreams, or for warding off the their troubles along with the heatwave. It's worth noting that many of the tunes are syncopated (the offbeats are emphasized; the weak beats are stressed instead of the normally strong ones), which lends the music a more human quality due to its decidedly imperfect nature. The tonal shifting is blatantly inconsistent at some points, but that's the only complaint I can think of.",In the Heights

They dance like everyday.A brand new musical drama on HBO max from the creators or The Hamilton and Crazy Rich Asians. The story about a town in Washington Heights where characters trying to live their dreams while finding their identity and root.First of all, as a musical, this was top -notch entertaining and fun. Almost every songs were dynamic, lively, and beautifully choreographed. The lyrics were just normal conversations between characters, but in sync with the beats. Even more, there's motions that match the beat of the song, like footsteps and sounds of water from the hose. Because of this, I was hooked to the screen the entire time, at the liveliness and passion from the characters.The musical also portrayed the cohesiveness of the town very well. The people in the town all knew each other, and the dances showed how much fun they had with each other. Whenever the people dance, whenever on the street or in the room, I just felt like I wanted to be part of the town. Also, even when the whole town struggles, the music still brought the people together.Despite how lively the town was, the characters living in it all had their own struggles and different dynamic. I liked that each song revealed the personal struggle, relationship, and hopes and dreams of the main characters. Even though I'm not Latino, I can still relate to some of the characters because of my background as an immigrant to the new country. Like some of the characters, I had to look at the previous generations in order to reflect on my future.The main theme of the movie was about moving forward and living the dream in the melting pot that is the US, while still not forgetting one's root and culture and people. I absolutely love this message, and the ending of the movie reflected this well.However, my biggest issue with this movie is that, even though the music was used well, I didn't feel as much emotion and impact as I hope I would. I felt like too much was focused on the music and dancing, and somehow the resolves of some of the characters didn't feel impactful. I understood the messages, but the execution was a bit off. The turning points were pretty predictable, which did dip down the impact.Overall, even though I didn't feel much emotion, this movie was still a great musical experience that I'm sure many will have a fun time with. 8/10.",In the Heights
41,tm-sheehan,A film musical with Umami to use gourmet food term,9,11 June 2021,"My Review - ""In The Heights.My Rating 9/10I've been waiting a long time for Lin-Manuel's film version of his first Broadway show ""In The Heights"" in which he performed the main male lead of Usnavi . The stage show opened on Broadway in 2008 and was nominated for 13 Tony Awards winning 4 Best Musical, Best Original Score, Best Choreography and Best Orchestrations.In the Heights is a musical with music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a book by Quiara Alegría Hudes. The story is set over the course of three days, involving characters in the largely Dominican neighborhood of Washington Heights in New York City.I've always had a passion and interest in stage and film musicals and would be the first to admit that often Hollywood gets it terribly wrong . Often with miscasting or in some cases like the musical film version of Nine (2009) committing both sins of miscasting with famous A list Actors and totally ruining the original intent of the stage version.I'm happy to say this is not the case with ""In the Heights."" if anything it's expanded the vision of Lin - Manuel Miranda . The movie version spotlights new talents in the major roles starring Anthony Ramos as Usnavi the young bodega owner (in a Spanish-speaking country) a wine shop or wine cella (in the US) a small grocery shop, especially in a Spanish-speaking neighbourhood. I was interested to read that Anthony Ramos is the only cast member of the film who doesn't speak Spanish.Other relatively unknown cast members born in the Dominican Republic or of Spanish Latino heritage cast in major roles are Leslie Grace as Nina Rosario the girl most likely to succeed at College and Melissa Barrera who is beautiful and delightful in the role of Vanessa the would be fashion designer who wants to move from The Heights to uptown and a new life. Vanessa has the eye of every straight male in the Latino Community and that includes Usnavi who needs a shove in her direction from cousin Sonny played so well by Gregory Diaz IV.That's enough of the plot lines from me except to say there are two reasons why I think this colourful and joyous celebration of ethnicity and culture succeed and that's because of Lin-Manuel Miranda its creator who involved himself in every frame of the movie including his choice of Director Jon M. Chu who did that other glorious salute to cultural diversity in ""Crazy Rich Asians."" 2018.There were only two names I knew in this movie Jimmy Smits who plays Nina's proud father and of course Lin- Manuel Miranda who takes a step back and plays a minor role of Piragüero a soft drink vendor . It's a delightful cameo role and the only musical film I can think of where the composer and creator has a part in the movie ?Special mention must be paid to one original member of the cast of the stage version Olga Meridiz as the matriarch of this community Abuela Claudia she is superb in her role and has one of the best musical numbers in the show. Her character adds the wisdom and experience of old age plus a soothing link to the younger generations vibrancy and restlessness.The wonderful musical production numbers were devised by choreographer Alice Brooks and mostly take place on location one of them pays a tribute to 1930's choreographer Busby Berkeley .Theres lots of little homages to old Hollywood musicals like the dancing vertically on a building wall which is similar to Fred Astaire's vertical wall and ceiling dance in Royal Wedding 1954.There's no elaborate costumes in this film it features vibrant colourful street clothes many purchased from fashion stores situated in Washington Heights which is located North of The Bronx and to the South of 155th Street.Two great film musicals came to my mind watching ""In The Heights "" not West Side Story as I thought would and while it may a sound a strange comparison they were the 1964 French film ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg "" for the sung dialogue and colour palette and ""Fiddler on the Roof.""1971 because of the story of an ethnic community, its struggles and aspirations and the vitality of its characters .The musical while much lighter and brighter than the much more dramatic ""West Side Story ""still manages to expose the disadvantages and inequality that Latino ethnic minorities still experience if they're illegals without citizenship or even if they manage to get to College or Higher Education when Nina relates her experience of being mistaken for a waitress at a function because of her skin colour .Lin-Manuel Miranda's score while featuring some hip hop wrap numbers that progress the story is very unlike his mega hit Hamilton . It features many Latino reggae style rhythms and very impressive orchestrations.I can't understand the logic of The Producers releasing the big Cinema Screen musical in the U. S. A. On HBO streaming simultaneously with its Cinema release.They must have been paid a huge fee by HBO as I suspect streaming in the USA may influence the films first weeks Box office receipts.As I always recommend with quality films made for Cinema screens ,especially a film with the scope of ""In The Heights"" see it on a Cinema Screen.Ps. A member of the audience I saw it with chuckled like I did at an unmistakable reference to ""Hamilton."" in the movie see if you spot it?I'm going to see ""In The Heights "" again soon there's too much to take in one viewing.",In the Heights

46,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,24 July 2021,"In The Heights, with a screenplay by Quiara Alegría Hudes, based on the musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda, has several issues, the most pressing, from which many musicals also suffer, is the superficiality of its dramaturgy, more centered on political-social messages. Debating, than in the story to check them out, which is endowed with shallow conflicts, becomes a panel of the adversities faced by immigrants in the USA, in line with the current narratives of American politics. The film was accused, by the politically correct gang, of colorism, but beyond that, it also suffers from racism, with only two small white characters, both of which reinforce thesis of white supremacism and systemic racism, a fact that the ""woke"" community fails to recognize or accusing, after all, there are prejudices of good and others of evil, but the establishment, which loves Lin-Manuel Miranda passionately, because it promotes the ""correct"" messages, has tried to ward off any bad controversies.Relying on musical strength to overcome the dramaturgy's flaws, Em Um Bairro De New York does not reach high flights, as it does not present songs that infect the audience or that they will hum through the streets after the projection. In addition, the musical structure has other similarities with that of Hamilton, also Miranda, leaving the questions in the air, which would be the egg? And what would the chicken be? And, which lacks originality? Anyone who has watched both will notice such similarities. With little narrative stuff, it remains for Lin-Manuel to appeal to cheap sentimentality, killing, from the middle to the end of the long text, the character ""abuela"", obviously, not before exposing the hardships of his immigration, which he ironically does in the moment of his death, managing to breathe a little more breath into the story, but at the same time making it predictable, from that fact to the resolution of the lottery prize.The musical numbers are accompanied by choreographies more or less and without aesthetic beauty, rare exceptions. Jon M. Chu's direction starts off powerful, but quickly loses its strength with repetitions and blurring. Anthony Ramos does a good job, but doesn't reach the expected prominence of the character, the same happens with his counterpart Leslie Grace. The technical questions are great, but they could be much better.Film viewed on the 23rd to the 24th of July 2021.",In the Heights

They take brave creative risks and do things you could never do live on stage. It's complex, not dumbed down. It's straight, not full of grievance.

It is an absolute 100% pure shot of joy, belief, and summer time vibes. I started smiling 2 minutes in and did not stop until the credits finished rolling. And I am not even a musical person (most of the time). Sometimes you just need to surrender to the verse. The story. The neighborhood. The optimism. I may not have lived in Washington Heights, but I saw my West Side Chicago community in every single note and story. It's been a year since theaters were open, but all it took was this movie to open up my spirit ALL. THE. WAY. UP.

Don't overthink it...just stand up, let go, and let the music play.",In the Heights
50,elicopperman,Fresh New Musical for the Heights,7,13 June 2021,"In 2005, then newcomers to Broadway Quiara Alegría Hudes and Lin-Manuel Miranda made a breakthrough with the smash hit In the Heights, a musical embracing the Latino side of New York City. Following Miranda's rise to fame with Hamilton and Moana and a film adaptation being in the works for over a decade, the public has finally been treated to a feature length revival of the show. Co-produced by Hudes and Miranda and directed by Jon M. Chu, the film has been garnishing acclaim from critics and fans alike, especially for a recent big budget musical from Warner Bros available in theaters and on HBO Max.Just like the original play, the film adaptation focuses on several different Washington Heights residents who have their own dreams. Usnavi, the central protagonist, is a bodega owner who looks after the neighborhood's aging Cuban lady, ""Abuela"" Claudia and wishes to go back home to the Dominican Republic by winning the lottery. Vanessa is the gorgeous deuteragonist working in the neighboring beauty salon who dreams of becoming a top fashion designer. Lastly, Nina Rosario is the college dropout of parents demanding a better life for her, all the while dreaming to find a purpose in life. Given all of those different set ups, one might imagine the narrative to be overly complicated. However, what In the Heights manages to do successfully in allowing Usnavi and the residents to develop smoothly is allowing them all to gain a dose of what it means to be home. Despite living in a not so good looking Manhattan neighborhood, everyone there has made the most of it through strong cultural heritage, music, dance, artistic integrity, love, and most of all, family.With all of that love and passion, this of course means the film has exquisite choreography and musical numbers. Like the best Broadway musicals, no matter how many songs there are, they all serve the plot so well that every transition between regular spoken dialogue and sung verses feels so seamless. Also, the actors are so good at capturing the necessary raw spirited energy of Latino singers and dancers that you instantly get into the story with them. No surprise here that the likes of Anthony Ramos, Leslie Grace, Melissa Barrera, Daphne Rubin-Vega have quite the vast singing background in addition to acting. In fact, the film could not have been kinder to allow Olga Merediz to reprise her original role as ""Abuella"" Claudia and shine like the sincere matriarch of the barrio. Of course, the remaining actors do solid performances on their own, but the added flavor of being able to sing through spot on dance scenes and solid lyrics makes this otherwise heartbreaking drama all the more powerful to anyone willing to dream as big as the rest.Lastly, I think part of why the film has been getting as much praise as of late is its message of dreaming for a better tomorrow. While the film does subtly interweave the notion that there really is no place like hope, it does so with an underlying message of doing whatever it takes to follow your true passions. In a day and age where people across the United States of America have been learning more and more about the corruption towards minorities and marginalized groups, an enlightening musical like this is just the kind of light people need to remind themselves why pursuing said dreams is important. It's not easy by any means, but just like how this adaptation couldn't fit all the songs or plot points from the original musical into its narrative, sacrifices must be made, even if it means having to compromise your own life with the people you love. Times may have changed since the original show's release, yet these themes of dreaming and fighting for what you believe is right remain as prevalent as ever. No shame in admitting that you want to make a difference in a hard world.Will In the Heights be the next big musical sensation in a long time? It's certainly debatable. However, with phenomenal songs, fully realized characters, strong themes and phenomenal direction, it's only a matter of time until the current positive public reception grows into a huge legacy for all to enjoy. If you're a fan of the original show, other works from Hudes and Miranda or you're desperate to see another big musical before Steven Spielberg's West Side Story comes out, definitely give this a go. Whether it'd be online or in the cinema, you'll really feel like you wanna be in the heights too.",In the Heights
51,ronakkotian,Ambitious but lacks the impact and connection,6,16 July 2021,"Musicals aren't my thing. The only musical I really like is La La Land but aside from that, they're not something I would go for. In the Heights isn't something I'm very fond of but there are aspects that I appreciate.In the Heights follows a group of characters living in Washington Heights as they sing and dream of a better life.I've never seen a Lin-Manuel Miranda musical before so I didn't know what to expect going into In the Heights. What immediately caught my attention were the songs and choreography. The songs were great and the dance choreography during some sequences were executed really well. The opening scene, the pool sequence and the dance taking place on the wall of a building stood out to me the most. However, aside from one, none of the songs really stuck with me after the film ended. They sounded great as they were taking place but I didn't grow an attachment to them in order to make me want to revisit them. Jon M. Chu did a good job directing the various sequences and all the actors were fun to watch. Anthony Ramos, Corey Hawkins, Melissa Barrera, Leslie Grace and the supporting cast sang their hearts out and felt like a strong community. I admire the themes of community, immigration, dreams, racism, family and more addressed in the film. It juggles these ideas well and uses the musical format to its advantage to convey it. There were cheesy moments throughout that didn't work for me and I felt the execution of the story's more dramatic elements were weak.I respect what Lin-Manuel Miranda is trying to convey with In the Heights but it's just something that didn't connect with me as much it did for other people. The actors do a solid job and some of the dance sequences were truly great but it still felt too long, quite cheesy and lacking that emotional and powerful impact I was hoping to get.",In the Heights

53,sweidman-28016,Fun and Lively,8,24 June 2021,"""Little details that tell the world, we are not invisible.""In the Heights is a film version of the Broadway musical in which Usnavi, a sympathetic New York bodega owner, saves every penny every day as he imagines and sings about a better life. This was supposed to be the kickoff of big summer movies, but unfortunately it yanked at the box office. Even the number of views on HBOMax were fairly small considering other movies like Mortal Kombat. I've now seen the movie twice. The first time, I was conflicted on a few aspects that I knew I couldn't give an accurate review. Now, I have reached my verdict. In the Heights translates well from stage to screen. The movie is full of energy and life. It's an overall enjoyable watch. Jon M. Chu recently directed the surprise hit Crazy Rich Asians. With that and now this, I think he's found his footing considering his other projects. Chu has a style that's jumpy and bright which works well here. The basis of the story is dreamers, and I think they captured that. With the ensemble they have, you won't find yourself having trouble finding a character to dislike. Anthony Ramos is born to be a star. From now on, I'll expect to see him in more projects. He's basically the perfect casting choice for Usnavi. I prefer him to Lin-Manuel Miranda (though I guess that's a given since I prefer his writer more than his acting/singing). Another standout is Olga Merediz reprising her Tony nominated role as Abuela Claudia. She lights up the screen and has the most heart of any character. She'll make you laugh with her jokes and (hopefully) tear up during ""Paciencia Y Fe."" Literally, everyone has their own part to make you like them.Speaking of ""Paciencia Y Fe,"" that is probably the best part of the whole movie. It's a true visual feast and the most character you'll get in one song. I wish other parts had that same feel as that song does. There's incredible production design and lighting. It's very imaginative. But also, most of the movie takes place in the block. It shows it in its natural setting, so that's also a great representation. Jon M. Chu's style can sometimes be a little too much. There's added visual effects that feel out of place, lens flares that go on for too long, just random bits of things that are supposed to make the watch ""more fun"" I guess. It already is so I don't really get why they were needed. Just my own personal thoughts. Also, there's two separate stories going on: one where he's telling the story, and then the main story. I think sticking to the main story would feel more natural. Plus, it would cut down a bit of the runtime because it is a bit longer than it needs to be. All in all, In the Heights is a fun movie. The choreography is great, the songs are fun, there's social commentary that should be talked about, it's just very lively. If you get a chance, I'd recommend seeing it either in theaters or on HBOMax.",In the Heights

Very good performances by the majority of the cast (don't sleep in some of the oldest ones), very well directed and edited, with great choreographies in every scene. A film with more than one message and all were delivered pretty well.But there are negative things: 3/4 too many songs and I was not totally conviced by the performance of the love interest of the main character. However, the biggest problem is the lack of representation of the Afro community within the Latin community. The couple who is supposed to represent this: he is not latin and she is mixed (even if both do a great job). It's a huge missed chance to speak about their own specific problems in the community and to...for example put the main actress (even if the same) with an afro hair, which we know has a stigma in the society.It could have been almost perfect but fails where it shouldn't: representation.",In the Heights

I became a part of Washington Heights family and danced along with them. However, when I have to appraise the value of 'In the Heights 'as a movie, I cannot say it is a well-made one. In the musical films, what differentiates good and great is not a music. (Most musicals guarantee high-quality soundtracks because music is their goals, focus, and ends.) It is how a director connects each segment of the stories. Individual song contains one theme and one storyline. For example, 'No Me Diga' narrates Nina's confusion and disappointment after one semester in Stanford just in one song, and the next song will capture a different story. 'In the Heights' fails to connect them smoothly. Music and choreography are outstanding, but the plot is unorganized, so I feel as I am watching a lot of music videos. Similar things happen in 'Hamilton', one of the other many works of Lin-Manuel Miranda. I have high hopes for 'Tick, Tick... Boom!' film version which is known to be Miranda's directorial debut. I wish he overcomes his weakness as a storyteller and director on the next project.",In the Heights

Overall rating 96/100In the heights centres on a variety of characters living in the neighbourhood of Washington heights. In the centre of it Usnavi (Anthony Ramos) a bodega owner who dreams of saving all of his money and escaping to his native country of the Dominican republic. Ultimately, Usnavi and the many residents of the close knit neighbourhood get a dose of what it means to be home.Wow what an incredible film. The cinematography was stunning and really vibrant. The soundtrack and the musical numbers were absolutely incredible, they were excellently choreographed and very catchy and memorable. I loved the character introductions. There was fantastic Latina representation that isn't seen enough in films. I loved the sense of community this film bought. It had such a charming tone, plus the cast had fantastic chemistry. The movie was hilarious with some fantastic comedic performances from Gregory Diaz IV and Stephanie beatriz. I loved the set up for the character development that payed off well. The movie had a good amount of character depth and tackled some deep themes on the struggles of poorer communities and racism. The performances were fantastic and the whole cast did a brilliant job, with a truly star making lead performance from Anthony Ramos. The characters were extremely likeable, and I liked the character conflict. The focus on the whole cast and separate storylines was brilliantly done. As well as the script, a surprising amount of emotional weight and a satisfying ending.My only slight issues was that some of the conflict felt forced, and I would have liked some more fleshed out relationships. Especially from Usnavi and Vanessa.But overall, In the heights is an absolutely joyous celebration of life and community. With fantastic musical numbers, being visually stunning and fantastic performances. There was never a dull moment and everyone should see this, the movie of the summer and one of my favourite musicals.",In the Heights

The film reminded me of the musicals of the 1950's and 60's especially west side story. I wish more musicals where done like this. The songs are fun and catchy there was maybe only 3 that I didn't like and that's why the film is not getting a 10. The acting was great the directing was also. I can see why the film was a flop at the box office with it being Latino and New York if you live somewhere else in the world you might not connect. I wish and hope over years people watch this film and give it the recognition it deserves. One of the best musicals so come out in a long time and one of 2021 best films.,In the Heights
59,movieman6-413-929510,Musical that appeals to one target group more than another.,6,2 July 2021,"In the Heights is a new romantic musical drama directed by Jon M. Chu, the director of Crazy Rich Asians and Now You See Me 2.The film is about the boy Usnavi (Anthony Ramos) who lives in Washington Heights, but dreams of returning to the island in the Dominican Republic. Despite going against his dream, Usnavi also begins to have feelings for neighborhood girl Vanessa (Melissa Barrera), who works as a fashion designer and probably doesn't want to go back with him after all. Meanwhile, his friends Benny (Corey Hawkins) and Nina (Leslie Grace) try to help the Washington Heights immigration community.The screenplay of this film was written by Quiara Alegria Hudes and is further based on the musical play by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Quiara Alegria Hudes is still a novice film writer, which is reflected in this film, because the various stories are mixed up a bit too messy and a clear main character comes forward in the film. This can make it difficult to follow the entire film properly. The film is actually carried more by the various entertaining music and dance scenes.Director Jon M. Chu fortunately has experience directing musical scenes as a director, because he has previously directed some Step Up films. Despite his experience, he unfortunately does not make much of the scenes in this film. A few scenes linger thanks to the beautiful singing and dancing talent, but the long running time of the film makes you forget many other scenes when they are over. As with Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu has also made a film that appeals more to a certain target group. In this film, he focuses more on Latin Americans, who are trying to ensure equality and justice in America. This film can also appeal to people who have left their own home country to start a safer or better life in another country.Anthony Ramos and Corey Hawkins have played in a musical film before in their acting careers. For Melissa Barrera and Leslie Grace, this is only their first real Hollywood movie. Together, the four of them manage to provide entertaining dance, singing and acting with the rest of the film cast.",In the Heights

61,Darkjak007,Piragua,7,2 July 2021,"In the Heights follows the story of a bodega owner named Usnavi Trying to save up every last penny so he can return to his birthplace of the Dominican republic in hopes of Reviving his father's old business and a new start. While various others of his local community in Washington Heights Vanessa girl of his dreams seeks a career as a fashion designer and Nina who returns home after her first semester at Stanford University, is greeted and welcomed back with arms having a secret of her own. All trying to do better for themselves and their community. People looked at this movie they immediately think of west side story which Does share similarities with its setting and it's choreography style in some way. It's completely opposite though there's really no big obstacle to overcome, no rival gangs, No Romeo and Juliet style romance for the most part it just a bunch of people struggles in Washington heights. While Usnavi is overall the main focus of the story it tries to intertwine the stories of multiple people and in most parts it doesn't flow as well as it should. Vanessa's a fashion designer, you think it really matters however it doesn't feel like it really goes anywhere, as well as the whole romance between her and Nabi which honestly Doesn't seem genuine there's not really that much time of them alone for the relationship to really feel warranted. Nina story and why she's back Home it feels like it will go somewhere but it doesn't build up to anything drastic, is a relationship between a ditchpatch employee who works at her fathers business. However with that being said the most important thing in a musical is it songs and that is the overall highlight of the movie. The songs are choreograph very well singers& dancers perform very well there's a huge amount of energy and you can tell the dedication put in to each number when they're on screen. These performers are Very fast paced and agile impressive such as the club. There's one scene where a guy twist his arm and his shoulder does turn that might be cg but it was still interesting to see. Except for one part having the singers dancing on the wall of the building it just doesn't look good and out of place the rest of the movie. The majority of the songs perform very well the one major downside of the songs in general is that there's just too many. If you count named songs with lyrics this movie has more songs than a Westside story about 17 song. There's songs that are longer than others and some that are just incredibly short that don't really feel necessary. They feel rather like they're just they're scenes for more music, where they could just have dialogue in place of it. You're not really given much breathing room there's just one song stacked back behind another. It's probably supposed to represent the community's unity as a whole but practically every character has a song. Abuela has a song and even the street vendor selling Piragua get a song. These are good but then you have songs like Benny's dispatch,Navi cousin Sonny and the salon lady's which are rather pointless. In the heights is a fun entertaining film that is worth of it viewing even though the plots not that focus it makes up for with it songs, dancing And its cinematography.",In the Heights

It's good entertainment, but it doesn't have a lot of amazing numbers (the more creative is by far ""Paciencia Y Fe"") and Miranda will compose much more enduring songs some years later for ""Moana"".",In the Heights

65,zac-04879,A Really Decent Musical-Drama,7,3 July 2021,"Especially for the lovers of musical talents, In The Heights is an unforgettable musical lead by an outstanding message. Unless you can't handle constant singing and dancing, add this moving powerhouse to your list! There's also an undeniably perfect selection of songs and the runtime rolls surprisingly very smoothly for a 2-and-a-half-hour symphonic. So other than some small amounts of uninteresting material, this enjoyable movie is an excellent cinema-worthy experience.Obviously don't watch this movie if you hate musicals. Again, there is frequent singing but the selection of songs is amazing. Despite some slow moments, it's very fast for a film over 2 hours, plus the dancing, acting and themes are just brilliant.To get honest with the film's not-so-great elements, the writing would have to be known as a little flat. Although their voices are excellent, the characters just can't compel enough to be like other good movie personalities without the singing. The songs and momentum of In The Heights is what you will truly mainly remember, as well as the beautiful colours and eye-catching dancing. The movement, oh it's unforgettable art.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",In the Heights

67,CriticsVoiceVideo,Inferior adaptation of the stage show.,4,11 June 2021,"I've seen the stage show 4 times and I love it. However, this film adaptation falls flat. They removed a lot of the important conflict and some of the most beautiful, moving, and romantic moments of the original score. The best thing about this is the setting. It sometimes really does evoke the feeling of Latino life in the city. Performances fall flat even though they look the part. Marc Anthony, Abuela, Nina, and Jimmy Smits stand out the most for authenticity. It's not the stage show I love so much and it bothers me that it's missing a lot of the key moments that I love. Some of the additions really work and some really don't. There are plot holes and age discrepancies, and Jon Chu is just not a very good director. Check his record. He does too much with special effects and it's distracting especially during Benny and Nina's song which should be intimate, romantic, and tender. I know it's a musical, but some parts are just too corny and I know green screen when I see it, I'm not an idiot. Also, Lin-honey, you don't need to be in every show. Know your place. You are not the performer you think you are.",In the Heights

And the story doesn't really that clear, but if take a step back and relax. It was quite fun movie.

Obviously, the singing and dancing are both breathtaking, though I'll admit that it was a little difficult to understand the words of certain songs sometimes. There were also a couple plot points that were unclear, leaving my family and me with questions, but overall, it was very well-written and entertaining. I can't think of a better movie to see back in the theater for the first time since before the pandemic!",In the Heights
70,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Upbeat and enjoyable, but not groundbreaking",7,10 June 2021,"I thought it was a perfectly fine musical. Lovely, entertaining, uplifting but not particularly outstanding and breaking any new ground. I feel like the songs ""Paciencia Y Fe"" and ""When The Sun Goes Down"" were the most visually interesting to look at. Otherwise, all the numbers just felt like stuff Ive seen before. Not that it's bad...the background dancers are quite good...just as I said ""not breaking new ground"".The story feels kind of familiar too, but I think the cast does a good job to breathe some life into it. Though, the movie is about 2 hours and 20 min long and feels long. I know this may seem sacrilegious to some but I think you could have totally cut Lin Manuel Miranda as the Piragua Guy out of the film. He doesnt really contribute anything to the characters/plot etc. I also dont personally care for narration so I didnt need Anthony Ramos as Usnavi coming in here and there to be ""Abuela Claudia had no children of her own, so she became an abuela to the whole community"". Like, can you not SHOW that. And there was a couple of times where they used music from Hamilton. Like the waiting music used on a phone call was ""You'll be Back"". Some might think its a cute easter egg...I kind of just found it distracting.I havent seen the stage show so I cant really compare the two. I know that Nina's motivations for leaving college are different. Just from what Ive read, I would have preferred the reason in the show.I still think overall its a cute movie thats upbeat and colourful. If you have HBO Max I think its worth the watch. If you dont have access like me (and also dont currently have access to a theater) and decide to rent it....well I think I could have waited til it was cheaper.",In the Heights
71,AdrenalinDragon,In The Meh kind of Musical,5,19 June 2021,"Similar to Hamilton, In The Heights didn't suck me in as much as I hoped it would as a Musical. On the upside, it's easier to sit through despite the fairly lengthy runtime. There are some good choices of shots and set pieces to tie the music into, but other times it's just characters singing in a bit of a bland and uninteresting way. The plot meanders somewhat and alot of characters to juggle around here too.In the end, there's just enough in there to hold my interest all the way without getting too bored. That being said, there's not really any song I could say I remember or would want to listen to, but there's nothing really that annoyed me too much either. Just another film that got way too much hype, and one that didn't live up to expectations for me. At best it's a mediocre Musical, at worst it doesn't stay with you all that much.4.5/10.",In the Heights

It needed to give the constant music and dancing a rest. And because of this, anything that could have been considered dramatic conflict just didn't come across as serious enough, making it very hard to connect with.The biggest woes: spoiled girl doesn't want to stay in college, lead character frets about getting the funds to start his overseas business (which is told in flashback after he already has it), an exceptionally old woman dies of natural causes and the city has a blackout that they sing and dance their way through. Not everything can be fixed with a musical number. And after two hours, the songs all bled into one.Oh and after the whole setup of the film, he just goes back to the Heights?! Well at least the salon moved because that was the only plot arc in the entire movie that literally went somewhere. I can see why this would work as a non-stop Broadway musical; on the stage it doesn't need to make sense and the characters/plot can stagnate as long as the performances of the score and choreography are captivating. But as a motion picture, this was tiring and wanting.",In the Heights

There are just some with huge numbers that are obviously written for the stage that just don't end as well without that burst of audience enthusiasm and that is the case a few times here. Having said that, it will be hard to find another film in 2021 that has this much talent on display in one film or this many awesome to behold visuals. This is a musical with so much exuberance it's like it wants to burst out of the confines of a screen to its roots. As of this writing I've not seen any other films directed by Jon M. Chu other than G. I. Joe: Retaliation, which was pretty lame to me, so that he has this much talent comes as a major surprise.

75,hunter-friesen,A Cinematic Celebration,6,7 September 2021,"The first fifteen minutes of In the Heights is right up there with ""Another Day of Sun"" from ""La La Land"" and the prologue from ""West Side Story"" as one of the all-time best openings to a musical. Director Jon M. Chu (the prolific helmer of the ""Step Up"" franchise and most recently, ""Crazy Rich Asians"") shows off major directing chops in several of the song-and-dance sequences, pairing his kinetic style with the colorful vibrancy of the setting and characters. Chu treats this film as a celebration, creating several moments of movie magic joyfulness.But even with the talent of Chu and his cast, ""In the Heights"" can't reach the heights (sorry, the pun was too easy of the musicals mentioned in the introduction of this review. The problem comes from the source material itself, famously written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegría Hudes, which places too many characters within the narrative and doesn't provide enough depth to create a genuine connection. The characters of Benny, Nina, and Sonny are those that come to mind, with Benny and Nina's romance lacking the passion one would expect.Immaculately crafted and performed, ""In the Heights"" lacks the human element that often burrows musicals into our hearts. I'm happy a musical with this cast and in this setting was able to be made, I just wish I could have liked it more.",In the Heights

A cornerstone of the community, he is torn between following his dreams to the D.

Because I got to know this neighborhood so well, watching this film was a personal treat.Director John Chu returns to his core repertoire in bringing this musical to life.

80,MovieBuff11732,An Enjoyable Musical That Came At The Wrong Time,9,18 June 2021,"In The Heights is a musical that came from the mind of Lin-Manuel Miranda. He was behind Hamilton and was also in the sequel to Mary Poppins, Mary Poppins Returns. He had the idea for this film when he was at the age of nineteen in college.In The Heights is about a man named, Usnavi (Anthony Ramos) who is dreaming of working at his fathers old bar in the Dominican Republic. At the moments, he lives in Washington Heights in New York City with many other immigrants from Dominican Republic. He makes plans to buy the old bar but a love interest (Melissa Barrera) and also family are both standing between him and his dream.When I heard about this film back in twenty nineteen I didn't really know what to think. I have never seen Hamilton so I am not really too familiar with Lin-Manuel Miranda's music style. So I didn't know how the music was going to end up being in the film. I also had no clue who the director was (John M. Cho). So I was naturally just thinking it was going to be alright and I walked out of the theater thinking it was a little above that standard. I was humming the opening number quite frequently the rest of the day. That was really the only song I came away with remembering. The music was good though. Nothing made me wince of look around the theater awkwardly like in the Momma Mia movies. The film ended up being a fun time. That was what I was expecting and that is what it delivered. It is by no means at the same level was West Side Story which is what Lin-Manuel Miranda looked at for inspiration. The songs even crammed in many conversation traits just as West Side Story did. He ended up going for more of a modern day feel with much of the music he wrote for the film. There was always a bass drum of beat you hear in many modern day songs. I didn't really make the songs bad or boring but I didn't really allow any of them to stand out besides for the opening and I guess one towards the end of the film called ""Carnival."" But the setting that was somewhat created felt really realistic. Sort of like Do The Right Thing. That movie had a town that you feel like you lived in and I would be stunned if Lin-Manuel Miranda says he has never seen that film before just because of how similar the town felt. The main plot wasn't anything out of the ordinary for a musical. Someone loves someone and she or he gets in the way of one of their dreams but then they realize love is more important that anything you can buy. So nothing with the plot structure and it was executed pretty much the same way you would think it would turn out besides for some events towards the end of the film. So that made the film feel a little predictable, but it didn't make the movie bad because of the setting and the songs did end up propelling the story a little farther.The acting was above par with most musicals. Most of the time it looks terrible when actors are trying to sing along to someone else singing the song like Little Shop Of Horrors. They went above that and sang their own songs. Which apparently Mary Poppins Returns also did which is pretty cool. They topped West Side Story with that. Otherwise, there wasn't much emotional acting required because most of it was told through song which it should be in a musical.The other problem I had with the film was the transitions. They would often go from a dark scene to an incredibly bright scene and it would make you blink. Or going from a quiet scene to a loud scene. That would ruin the mood or upset the viewers eyes. It was just really annoying. Editors have been getting more careless in recent movies. They need to try to make their editing more like the Duffer Brothers. They were behind the show Stranger Things and they would ease you into a scene perfectly. More movies need to take notes from that show and especially this one.In The Heights was a blast of a movie that sadly didn't really leave any songs to remember and had some sloppy transitions. I would recommend In The Heights to anybody who like musicals or has seen Hamilton.",In the Heights
81,isaacochoterena,Favorite movie of the year so far,10,25 August 2021,"I don't have much to say about this movie, I loved every second and I loved the story. It has good songs which add things to the plot, it has many good performances, you can see the talent of everyone who worked on this film, it has good choreography, it is very well directed, the script is very convincing, I love how not only it is focuses on a single story, but manages to explain almost each of the characters, has an excellent message about dreams, explains the general situation of the dreamers and manages to empathize with each of the characters.For me it is perfect, but I can detect things that were missing such as a closing for two characters that are not mentioned much in the final sequence and that there is a scene that is a bit implausible and somewhat cliché.I think it brings a different vision of immigrants in the USA, not only Latinos, people of everywhere too, and that we all have dreams to fulfill and that even though you may be disappointed along the way, you should never stop trying to reach them.",In the Heights
82,bastille-852-731547,"Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical is authentic, energetic and fun",7,9 June 2021,"I think Lin-Manuel Miranda is incredibly talented, and thought ""Hamilton"" was incredible (although I've only seen it on Disney+, and sadly never on stage.) Needless to say, I was looking forward to this musical slice-of-life set in the vibrant neighborhood of Washington Heights in uptown Manhattan. The film centers around a bodega owner named Usnavi, whose parents immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. Joyous and filled with energy, the movie's music is often incredibly well done. Lin-Manuel Miranda's lyrics are fast, kinetic, and clever, combined with plenty of well-choreographed singing and dancing. The film also does an outstanding job showing the diversity, pluralism and cultural heritage of Washington Heights, and the various communities and cultures found there.With its catchy music and thoughtfully inclusive cultural representation, the film is certainly a crowd pleaser. I'm happy to say that the audience I saw it with applauded after many of the musical numbers, and also gave a hearty applause at the end. It's certainly great to see an audience in a theater respond to a film like that again. That said, the film does fall short of greatness for a few reasons. It could have used more of a plot in between its musical numbers, which is part of the reason why it's not quite as impactful as something like ""Hamilton."" Usnavi is a generally engaging protagonist, but some of the other characters could have been more developed. Finally, the film does run a bit too long. Being a bit thin on plot but comparatively lacking in impressive musical set pieces compared to the rest of the film, the second act certainly feels like it drags a bit in comparison to the first and third acts. Yet despite these criticisms, there's something truly radiating about the film's vibrancy and joyful enthusiasm--which is, frankly, what we all need right now. Recommended. 7.5/10.",In the Heights

88,dfloro,Lin-Manuel Miranda's first big-time musical,8,10 June 2021,"A friend who hopped on the Hamilton bandwagon relative early (with the original cast on Broadway) said to me, ""I think this guy, Lin-Manuel Miranda, may be a freakin' (word substitution there) genius!"" Naturally, I assumed that was the hyperbole common to those who think they've discovered something that is solid gold both. But having seen ""Hamilton"" and his earlier stage musical work, ""In the Heights,"" translated to the big screen, it's getting pretty difficult to argue with that assessment. This one is about the hopes and dreams of its many and varied characters, just as ""Hamilton""is about the hopes and dreams of the United States' founding fathers.The ""Heights"" in question is Washington Heights, a big Apple neighborhood at the north end of the isle of Manhattan populated primarily by people of color, and where Lin grew up. Quiara Alegría Hudes adapted for the screen her book for her musical stage play. The notable director of ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" Jon M. Chu, directs the energetic proceedings here. And of course, like Hamilton, all the music (from salsa to beats of merengue and bachata, to bomba y plena) and all the lyrics (which are almost exclusively hip-hop) are from the one-and-only Lin-Manuel. (A plump and bearded Lin appears in a mostly comic, near-cameo role that I won't spoil for you.) Combine all this with the endless joy of choreography & constant dancing and the innovative D. P. techniques (the cast says no harnesses were used in the ""side-of-the-building"" scene, which raises a serious question: ""WTF?!?"") and you have a real winner for generations of immigrant New Yorkers and their off-spring and the whole Latinx community, and a ""West Side Story"" for a new millennium.

90,Harry_Gleeson,A Shot of Summer,7,16 July 2021,"Overall i thought In the Heights was a solid feel good musical that was made for the summer. Its a film that knows what it wants and shines with wonderful song writing and good performances. The entire cast of the film gave their all to the film in terms of energy but Antony Ramos (Usnavi) and Corey Hawkins (Benny) were standouts to me as their specific performances added to the films tone and excitement when they were on screen.Lin Manuel Miranda (best known for Hamilton) shows his uniqueness as a song writer here by delivering some excellent music, most notably the song itself 'In the Heights' and also '96,000' were personal favourites. The man has such a gift at this work and there's no wonder his projects have grown to become huge fan favourites. Lin's writing is different to others and that's a big reason why he stands out for the better.Technical wise the film had strong cinematography and editing. Shooting on location in New York helped hugely with that.However the screenplay of the film was weak in relation to other areas. There were many cliche's and lines that were cringe and made the film seem too predictable. But the cringe/OTT elements of the film did hinder my overall experience because it lost the heart of what it was trying to say.But the film is all about a community spirit and in times like these I can't begrudge thatQuote - 'The streets were made of music' - UsnaviRating - 3/5.",In the Heights

Overdone. Overly loud. A cast far too big.It is as though the music and choreography is not good enough and so the director - knowing this - threw 'more of everything' at the screen so that the public will overlook the emptiness. Dance numbers feature quick cut after quick cut so that the actual skill and grace of the dancers is lost. It's as if the producers / director felt, 'If 20 dancers is good, 100 will be great'. 'If dancing in a swimming pool is great, let's have the pool-dancing underwater."" At no time during this film did any character ring true (oh, maybe the young kids at the film's opening); it's as though they're all coldly reciting lines in front of a camera that we cannot, not for one instant, forget is there.

93,Benslie,A catchy soundtrack with heart but isn't completely flawless,9,16 June 2021,"I just want to start off by complimenting the cinematography in this movie that makes it so worth it to pay the price of admission to see this movie in theatres. The other point that makes this movie worth the price of admission is the amazing choreography in this movie. I remember hearing that Jon M. Chu wanted different dance styles there to be different styles of dance in this movie to represent everybody's different dreams, leading to some crazy dance sequences. I know some people might be upset over the movie changing the music style to make it more current but, in my opinion, I enjoyed the change. I feel like this movie chose the right director for this movie with Jon M. Chu because you can tell that he put so much passion into this movie to make it a spectacular explosion of Latin culture. I love that this movie wasn't afraid to show the hardships for people who immigrated to any country but specifically the US in this movie. Furthermore, I love how you could easily see that the cast making this movie were having fun with it and were giving it their all even if they were just background dancer number 23. I would say that there was a standout actor for me to shout out but in all honesty, I feel like we never fully got to know the characters. I've never seen the show but I have listened to the original soundtrack and I know that certain songs were cut out that would have brought more depth for certain characters. I felt like I never fully understood these characters and their relationships with one another. Another problem that didn't help was the quick editing in this film. For a good chunk of the scenes, the transitions between them were jarring and never felt natural.

Modern film makers of musicals should watch the old Fred Astaire musicals to show what good dancing is and keep the camera still!!!Other than that story line is interesting and nice acting. But all the rap is a bit much. How about music one can understand the hum along with lyrics that make sense like that of Porter, Gershwin, Lerner and Lowe etc.Another problem with the film is its a bit long.

I am a native New Yorker born in Spanish Harlem (Manhattan). However, there are many Afro-Dominicans living in Washington Heights, and this film primarily portrays light-skinned or white Hispanics.Melissa Barrera is Mexican actress and Corey Hawkins is African American playing Dominican characters. Corey Hawkins at times in the movie spoke as if he had an Dominican accent. An Afro-Latino actor should have played a major role. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of my fellow young Boricua brother, Anthony Ramos. I would have preferred to see Afro Cubano Laz Alonzo, native Washingtonian, and Howard University graduate cast in this movie. They should also have cast Afro Cubana Gina Torres in this movie.Racism continues to exist in the Hispanic community and I see it every day on Telemundo and Univision. Furthermore, the majority of Caribbean Hispanics in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Cuba do not care or get along with Mexicans, Salvadorans, and other Central Americans. Our Caribbean culture is different, and the slave trade occurred in the Caribbean, and not so much in Mexico and Central America.In my opinion, I think Lin Manuel Miranda is color conscious with respect to casting Latinos with lighter skin and European features, 'In The Heights'.",In the Heights

The way the director put this film together with the music and dancing really is amazing and is what makes this movie stand out amongst other musical movies. I love the performances from the cast aswell, Anthony Ramos is fantastic in this and his performance is by far the stand out thing in the movie. He needs to be in more lead roles as he really did surprise me with his acting abilities in this movie. Other characters are amazing aswell and everyone in the movie works well together and have their own stand out songs and moments. My only problem with this is that the first couple songs from the female characters don't look right, something about the actors lip syncing up with the words just doesn't look right, It's only for the first song of theirs but it's just strange as it doesn't happen again. Speaking of the songs, these are my favourites in a musical that I've seen, I love the hip-hop approach that Lin Manuel has done with the songs, they just flow so well with the film and the quick cut directing. I really really enjoyed this movie, even if you don't like musicals go and see this as you will be surprised. A definite must see if 2021!",In the Heights

As someone who's really picky about that stuff, I was still very impressed with how they did it. I'm already excited for the DVD.",In the Heights
98,arod_85,"Good talent, poor story",6,24 June 2021,"The singers and dancers are amazing. However, like other reviewers have already said, the movie drags and does not have enough of a plot to keep you vested. One thing I do not feel the movie should be apologizing for is the lack of diversity. I am biracial, African American dad and Latino mom, and before watching I had already heard all the fuss about the lack of diversity. I watched just trying to figure out what the problem was because I felt like the movie was very diverse! I heard the problem was lack of Afro-Latino individuals which I thought the main character, the girl that left Stanford, looked more of Afro decent than a stereotypical Latina. We can't move toward equality if we are constantly looking for reasons to cause division. Yes, in some cases speaking up and calling others out is necessary, in ""The Heights"" case, I did not feel like it was.",In the Heights
99,Eclectic-Boogaloo,What's all the fuss about?,5,13 June 2021,All the things that are wrong with this movie could be summed up by the big midpoint dramatic sequence.Character drama with celebratory singing and dancing. A dramatic scene where everyone's happy. It's so dark. But LOOK AT THE FIREWORKS!!!This movie is too long and can't seem to let any drama build for more than 30 seconds before assaulting the screen with smiling faces and singing. I'm Latino so I really wanted to like this. Some of the songs are. Ice. Some of the themes resonated with me. But the music and dance is not strong enough to carry a 2.5 hour movie with no drama and focus.Favorite scene: the abuela musical number with the flashback (paciencia y fe). Fantastic!,In the Heights
100,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,In the Heights of Musicals,8,12 June 2021,"Streamers, it's finally here! In the Heights has been released this weekend simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max after being delayed an entire year due to the pandemic. I'm sure for fans of the Tony-winning Broadway production they have been waiting even longer than just this year delay. With this vibrant and energetic musical coming to the big screen, it's just another sign of America gradually emerging from the pandemic and the summer movie season in full swing. I braved the theater to get the ""heights"" of In the Heights, and here's how it went.As I mentioned, In the Heights is an adaptation of the Broadway musical from Lin-Manuel Miranda with the screenplay written by Quiara Alegria Hudes and directed by John M. Chu. The elements come together with eye-catching visuals, fierce choreography and heartfelt songs to tell the story of Washington Heights and the people there who are striving to achieve their dreams. Our main character and narrator is Usnavi, who owns the bodega, but he is saving to move back home to the Dominican Republic. Usnavi introduces us to the rest of the main ensemble, which includes Vanessa, an aspiring fashion designer trying to move downtown; Nina, the brilliant student who left to attend Stanford; Benny, Nina's love interest and dispatcher at Nina's father's business; Mr. Rosario, Nina's father who will do anything for Nina to succeed; and Abuela Claudia, the heart and soul of the community. Their stories weave in and out infused with music and hope telling a quintessential story about community, growth and the price of chasing dreams.If you are a fan of musicals, you will be swept away by In the Heights. The filmmakers have done a remarkable job translating this stage musical into a movie spectacle. Everything is big - group dance numbers, swooping shots of Washington Heights, bright, enticing colors and infectious music. Casting Anthony Ramos as Usnavi was the best thing for this movie. He's a grounding presence and such a talented guy. Ramos has got that Lin-Manuel cadence down pluses he's cool and charming and can move. He captures the emotion of his character and connects to the others in the ensemble very well. I'll also single out Olga Merediz, who is the emotional center. She is so wonderful as Abuela Claudia. She really embodies the warmth attributed to her character, and it is so believable that the entire block sees her as their abuela. She has a moving musical number as well. Ramos and Merediz are just two of the cast that are great, but all of the performances are top notch and each character has a moment to shine.What's really great about In the Heights is that it truly is a feel-good movie. There is no unnecessary villain, and even though some of the story tends towards some clichés, it is always engaging. There are some really great set pieces with a lot of dancers and great, propulsive music - each one is like a big shot of adrenaline. The film does a lot to keep your attention and movie the story along to a satisfying conclusion. However, it must be said that 2 hours and 18 minutes is a long runtime. It could have been 20 or so minutes shorter and still told the same wonderful and vibrant story, but I didn't mind spending this time in Washington Heights with Usnavi, Abuela Claudia, Vanessa, Benny, Nina and the rest.For me, In the Heights is a must see film, especially for musical fans. There's a great cast giving wonderful performances. The music is infectious and the visuals are vibrant. While the film is too long, it never bores and has a really heartfelt and beautiful message. Grab that big box of popcorn and don't miss this movie - at the theaters or on HBO Max, whichever you prefer.S2S: I agree with Trip wholly. As a New York resident and public defender of the Bronx, this is absolutely a lovely story about our people. This is also a story that needs to be explained across the country. We have Americans all across this country from different backgrounds that are just coming to live a great life. Let their stories be heard and give them a chance to thrive. Let's keep the neighborhoods alive and with the spirit they've cultivated for decades. Never forget the past and never stop trying to bring about a better future. My only qualm with this movie is it feels a bit too Hamilton/Lin-Manuel-ish at times. He's brilliant, and Quiara Hudes has brilliantly distilled the stage musical into this movie. Can't wait for more from both with an even more unique voice. Musicals aren't everyone's jam but for those of you that are afraid of the singing and dancing, I must admit you'll still be touched by the storytelling and visual display in this movie. You might not rush to it, but if you have time and HBO Max you'll be entertained with a bowl of popcorn.",In the Heights

The script and the film in general badly needed an editor. Chop off about 30-45 minutes of material and you likely would have a great show, but instead, you have a good show.",In the Heights
113,theshanecarr,Summer time and the living ain't easy,6,6 July 2021,"The hype was high for this. With songs from Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of 'Hamilton', (which has at times been on hard rotation in this house) and being the first truly uplifting crowd-pleaser we would see in the cinema since the pandemic shut everything - we were ready to be transported and to dance in the aisles.Maybe no film could live up to that sort of pressure. 'In The Heights' is good but there's some crucial mis-steps that stop it from reaching the sky.The cast deliver. Anthony Ramos brings out the wistful dreamer in Usnavi (though perhaps the movie works too hard to ensure his rough edges never show). Melissa Barrera is luminous as Vanessa, the nail tech with dreams of moving downtown. Corey Hawkins brings lightness and charm to the best friend role. Jimmy Smits has the right world weariness as the father trying to do right by his daughter. Olga Merediz is appropriately soulful as Claudia, who has seen so much already.The songs largely work. The opening number, 'In the Heights', detailing the hard-scrabble but minor joy of living in Washington Heights is the highlight. It's unfortunate that nothing across the over-two hour runtime again matches the joy and power of this song but that isn't necessarily down to the music itself but how the story is told. 'Breathe', and '96,000' provide some other standout musical highlights.The joy of some of the songs is the insight they can offer us into the lives of this community high up on Manhattan's west side. I've read about the feelings of erasure experienced by generally dark-skinned Afro-Latinos who make up a big part of that part of the city. It's sad to think that a movie which must feel like such a celebration of one community can feel like such a disappointment to another. It's hard to believe the producers/director weren't aware of the issue, and it's certainly a missed opportunity given how few stories from that part of the world are told on this scale.Unfortunately there's another disconnect in the centre of the story. One that, for me, was mystifying. The film is, in many ways, a celebration of the Latinx community in Washington Heights, of how they have fought and won their place in America, but the central story is about how Usnavi wants to get out. His little dream is to go back to the Dominican Republic which he left when he was eight. Vanessa too wants to leave the Heights behind, and while she doesn't want to go quite so far, her little dream is to move out of the area.There's a tension here that can't be resolved - the characters want to leave behind something that the movie is telling us they should be proud of, and it's hard to root for that. Why is Usnavi trying to reverse the work of his parents in coming to New York, and raising him in this land of opportunity? What happened to their American dream?That things were, in some ways at least, better in the motherland is a common refrain of immigrants but rarely do we hear the stories of those who want to throw up their hands and say ""I'm out.""'West Side Story' (and won't it be interesting to compare the forthcoming Spielberg version to this movie) understands that life isn't easy for its Puerto Rican Sharks but it shows them determined to carve out their piece. Here, on the verge of a generation making it in college, and in business, our lead character wants to bow out. It's a frustrating choice that the film never makes sense of.Perhaps it is this irreconcilable tension which leads to a feeling of stasis in the middle of the movie. (Surely a cardinal sin in a musical.) Onscreen titles from the beginning count down to a forthcoming blackout priming us for this as the films climax. And a couple of things do indeed happen but the blackout rolls on, and much as it creates overheated lethargy in the community, it freezes the film in a sweaty amber. Scenes of the community sitting around, packing up their businesses all feel very anti-climactic at a moment when the narrative engine should be roaring.That a looming problem for one of the characters is fixed by one of the laziest deus ex machinas in the screenwriting toolbox also seems to strike at the heart of the American dream that this Latinx community is (mostly) striving for.Maybe the American dream can't work for everyone, maybe there is a discrimination baked into the system too difficult to overcome - that would be a powerful conclusion to reach - but the film is too eager to endorse the myth that all obstacles can be overcome. It offers up a last-minute reprieve to a character that (no matter the earlier foreshadowing) rings absolutely hollow in its offer of false hope.That earnest need to please (this isn't Sondheim) and leave you going out on a high is part of many musicals charm but when dealing with very real, and current, issues, it seems too easy to reach for such a solution.The ending sends out more of these mixed messages. Bubbling under a number of the stories is the sense that the neighbourhood is changing, that gentrification is pushing this close-knit community out. The ending suggests an accommodation with this gentrification that left me a little cold. Perhaps this is what Miranda and screenwriter Quiara Alegría Hudes (who also wrote the book for the stage version) see as the only possible answer to the irresistible forces of capitalism and rising rents; finding a way to celebrate and crucially, sell, something of the Latinx community to the new (white) neighbours. As staged in the film by director Jon M. Chu (director of 'Crazy Rich Asians') however, it comes off as uncomfortably close to selling out - a tourist version of what had made Washington Heights so special.Perhaps Chu wasn't the right choice to direct this. He has form in the musical area, having previously directed 'Step Up 2: The Streets', and 'Step Up 3D' but he makes a strange choice here to constantly frame the dancers close-up. This, and the fast edits, restrict our ability to appreciate the choreography. Something, that on a stage would be a major source of joy and wonder, is lost.There are, to be sure, some quite cool substitute pleasures; the Esther Williams-inspired synchronised swimming of '96,000' and the Fred Astaire-inspired dancing on the walls of 'When The Sun Goes Down' but it's frustrating not to be allowed experience the visceral thrill of these performers cutting loose in a simple wide-shot.I'm aware I'm spending far more time on the faults of the movie than on its strengths but that's in part because my hopes were so high. And because I'm still working it all out in my head.This was a fun and fascinating insight into a community I know little about but the movies desire to please, to pretend that everything in the Heights is magical makes it seem more like a fantasy land than the upper, upper, upper west side story it could have been.",In the Heights

117,iamianiman,"It's like watching a bunch of crowd chanting, singing, and dancing for the World Cup.",9,10 June 2021,"Came in with a very low expectation, not knowing this was inspired by a Broadway musical, not to mention I couldn't care less if this movie was delayed because of Covid-19 and had never seen the trailer before prior to my first viewing, but when I got around to watch it it, damnnnn... I was stunned and shocked to admit that this is in my top 3 Broadway/theater-based musical genre after La La Land & The Greatest Showman.Rarely we get to see a Hollywood film where all of the cast are led by the Latino community. This movie speaks volumes for them, where the central message lies on hope, racism, dual standard, dreams, family, friendship, the art of letting go and what it means to become an outsider.In the Heights is inspired by its Broadway musical and as far as the story goes, they cut Nina's storyline and it gets sidetracked when hers should also be the highlight alongside Vanessa's. The story doesn't go as deep as Les Miserables but isn't as shallow as The Greatest Showman either (The only problem with TGS for me), it stays somewhere in the middle, just enough to get your attention.In the Heights sends chills down your spine every time you witness the cast dancing and singing. The best thing is that the music and showmanship get better the more times you watch it and I will assure you, you'll have your fingers tapping backward and forward on your device to rewatch some of your preferred numbers. My top 3 songs include In the Heights, 96,000 & Carnavel del Barrio.What's outstanding in this film is that there are parts in almost every dance number, some dancers go unsynchronized with the choreography. But as the audience, you couldn't care less because the songs are so juicy and refreshing, the only thing you want is to just rejoice and have yourself grooving. What's even better is that the unsynchronization actually makes the movie better, with deeper related metaphors; in that we accept people's imperfections and to let go of the insecurities within us and just... enjoy your life to the fullest!One thing though, the colour grading could have been better. It paints this dour, gloomy, half-cooked gritty world all over it. Even when the scorching Sun arrives, it seems to have appeared somewhat dull. I get the intended meaning behind it, that this community's life is pale and has its sufferings amidst Summer is happening but imagine if the colour is as bright as The Greatest Showman or La La Land or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. You'll be drooling all over your shirt 🤤. P. S: Colours in musicals play a pivotal role in enlightening the world and its mood.In the Heights is a cinematic treat for your eyes and ears; amidst the pandemic happening, the economic downturning and the mental health issues arising, there has never been a perfect time to release this film until now in Summer! This is an important film for all and it's what we need!Now, I watch the trailer and listen to their music about 50 times a day, I promote it on my Instagram (@iamianiman) every day so that my friends know this is the hidden gem of the Summer. Can't wait to watch it again and again and again especially in the cinemas!Verdict: In the Heights really sets the bar high, making it incomparable with other contenders this Summer. This crowd pleasing event is the ultimate cure for the world and the rekindle of lost friendship, shattered hopes and retired dreams all because of the pandemic.P. S: If The Greatest Showman were created for the Winter, In The Heights were created for the Summer.",In the Heights
118,meurernick,The First Blockbuster of Summer 2021,7,12 June 2021,"I am considering this the first blockbuster of the summer. When watching this, I thought to myself, does this give Latin American people the same feeling that Black Panther gave Black people? While they are two totally different types of movies, but both give these communities a voice and a sense of brotherhood. This movie was also super fun to watch. I'm a sucker for musicals (La La Land is my favorite movie) and this did not disappoint. The songs, the choreography and all the characters. It also had some fun visual effects (especially during 96,000). Some of the lighting choices and coloring were great, pay attention during Paciencia y Fe! So much vibrancy. And the editing. I like how cuts would happen to correlate with the music. It was also nice to see some of the actors from the play show up in the movie, looking at you Abuela and Lin Manuel-Miranda. The movie also didn't just follow the play word for word, they added more to make the story more relevant to today and showed some real issues people deal with. I can definitely see this getting multiple award nominations (Picture, Director, Visual Effects, Costumes, Cinematography, Adapted Screenplay and Editing).",In the Heights

125,JoelAlexanderr,A fun ode to one's hometown that delivers a strong sense of community,8,28 June 2021,"Any fans of Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, or musicals in general have been eagerly anticipating IN THE HEIGHTS for some time now. While it's nowhere near as groundbreaking or as well-written as Hamilton, it still has plenty to latch onto and will for sure satisfy any fans of the three groups mentioned above.The standout aspect of this film from the very start is the cast and the choreography. All of the best sequences throughout IN THE HEIGHTS are the larger-than-life dance numbers that occur periodically throughout, which help highlight the immense talent in both the lead and supporting roles. It's hard not to dance during numbers like ""Carnival Del Barrio"" or ""96,000,"" which are two shining examples for future directors of how to choreograph and stage an epic ensemble musical number.The other facet of this film that makes it such a joy to watch is the passion for the neighborhood it depicts. From the beginning to the end, it is easy to tell that the film was written and shot with a love for the area of Washington Heights and the people within it. However, the movie as a whole was less about the specific neighborhood of the Heights, but about any place that was home for a long period of life. Most of us have a street or a town that made us who we are today, and IN THE HEIGHTS is an ode to those communities that makes us who we are.Unfortunately, while IN THE HEIGHTS is never less than incredibly enjoyable and a great time, it never quite rises above that either. The best musicals are the ones which give the audience goosebumps during every musical number and that tug on the heart strings near the end, and while this film gets close to that standard, it never quite reaches those heights (get it, haha wow I'm so funny). The ending in particular just feels like a standard movie ending, and never gave me the emotional closure I wanted from the narrative. The movie still succeeds overall, but those with the highest expectations might find that the movie only reaches ""very good"" and never ascends to ""fantastic.""IN THE HEIGHTS is still definitely worth the watch and is a perfect antidote to months without seeing one another. Nothing screams ""Covid is on its way out"" more than seeing dozens of people dancing in a crowded city street during the heat of the summer. B+",In the Heights

A lot of the issues facing the characters are poignant to contemporary society and the musical does a very good job at highlighting the harsh reality faced by many within these communities. Overall, this a very good musical movie and certainly one that fans of musicals should see and to those who aren't, the story itself is definitely one to invest 2 hours of your life into.",In the Heights

The lead star of the film is Anthony Ramos and in the heights is a celebration of Hispanic, Latino film in contemporary America. The choreography and dance fiesta is filled with symbolic energy and human nature. The story is set in the neighborhood of Washington heights, New York.

129,AllanSmitheee,An absolute delight with rewatch quality,10,10 June 2021,"Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit stage musical (before Hamilton) finally crosses over to the silver screen after years of development hell. Whether you've seen it live or not, In the Heights is sure to take skepticism and leave the audience dancing in the aisles.In the Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights lives twentysomething Usnavi, who aspires to go beyond the bodega store he oversees to the Dominican Republic. The barrio is full of colorful characters, including Abuela Claudia, the wise matriarchal figure of the barrio; Vanessa, an optimistic fashion designer; salon owner and queen of gossip Daniela; Usnavi's younger cousin Sonny, who has ambitions beyond his slacker style; and Benny, Usnavi's best friend and a dispatcher working towards opening his own business. Returning home that sweltering July morning is Nina, who's dropped out of college despite the neighborhood's awe of her being the only one to get away. Her father Kevin, owner of the local cab service, has been managing finances to keep Nina educated.The cast is stacked with talent of stage and screen, with the likes of Anthony Ramos (Hamilton), Olga Merediz (reprising her Tony-nominated role), Melissa Barrera (Vida), Daphne Rubin-Vega (Rent), Gregory Diaz IV (Vampires vs. The Bronx), Corey Hawkins (Straight Outta Compton), singer/songwriter Rose Leslie, and Jimmy Smits. The adaptation, as one would assume, had to alter from the stage production but that job is done by none other than Quiara Alegria Hudes, who penned the musical's book. Three-time Emmy nominee Christopher Scott really brings the musical numbers to life through such exquisite choreography that I, a huge musical fan, got lost in. In the director's chair is LXD creator Jon M. Chu, known for the financially successful Crazy Rich Asians and notorious flop Jem and the Holograms (the latter of which I no longer hold him responsible), and his skills shine in this enchanting tale of unity, community and following your dreams. 5/5.",In the Heights
130,jaredkjacoby,Musical Magic!,9,14 June 2021,"Based on the stage musical by Quiara Alegria and Lin-Manuel Miranda, In The Heights tells the story of a corner in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City following five people who dream of better lives. Usnavi is a bodega owner who can inherit his late father's business in the Dominican Republic where he can start a new life. The bodega consists of Abuela Claudia, the matriarch of the neighborhood, Kevin Rosario, who runs the tax company, his employee and Usnavi's friend Benny, Vanessa who wants to become a fashion designer, three ladies from the salon and Usnavi's cousin Sonny. All of them have creative dreams, but reality hits them hard. Despite that, they are not willing to give up so easily.This is the second musical that I have seen in theaters since La La Land. Musicals have grown on me in the past few years. They are very joyful and catchy compared to the other genres. However, they can also be cringeworthy when done poorly such as Cats. No matter how they end up, they are a nice change of pace from the films that I usually watch. For this movie, I was not that interested in it until I heard the buzz around it. Then I showed my mom a trailer to it and we decided that we would go see this film this weekend. Does it live up to the acclaim?The most important aspect of a musical is obviously the songs, especially one like this because the movie is around 80% singing and dancing. Even the simplest interactions provoke musical numbers because it is based off of a stage musical. In The Heights delivers on the music on every level. The musical pieces are magical here. They flow so naturally, especially the opening song where Usnavi addresses the audience while rapping. The musical numbers never felt corny or cheesy, but natural and authentic. Each song sounds so pleasant to listen to. There is not a single bad song in the film. The style of the filming and editing is so energetic. Instead of a bunch of long takes (though this movie does have them), it has a lot of well placed cuts that give the movie rhythm and timing. The cinematography is gorgeous as well with the best shots being the shot of everyone in the pool. The camera movement is just as smooth, especially during the climax of the $96,000 set piece. The dancing is particularly impressive. They managed to get a lot of professional dancers in the background and even the stars have experience with Broadway. It shows! Nobody ever misses a beat here. Despite being a colorful and upbeat musical, the songs show a darker side to Washington Heights.When I started watching this movie, I was just thinking about how much of a fun musical it is, but it occurred to me around the time they were singing about the lottery tickets is how much the songs show what the neighborhood is like. This community scrapes by with their daily businesses while their dreams stay as nothing but dreams. Behind the cheerful music lies a darker tone with the characters dealing with problems and struggles. Each song told a story or advanced the story in a clever way. That is why I love this so much as a musical. The authenticity and energy are both here. The storytelling by music has rarely been this fun.As for the characters they all have their personalities and hidden depths. Usnavi wants to leave, but it is clear that he is one of the people that helps the community the most. Sonny seems to be this sweet energetic cousin, but there is a secret about him that made me feel sorry for him. Nina is a college student who wants to avoid it after getting searched when her roommate was missing a necklace. She ends up dropping out after a rough time at Stanford as they treated her poorly. Benny is cocky, but he is always fun to watch. Abuela Claudia is the friendly lady who everyone looks up to, but she seems ready to go. Then there is Vanessa who seemed to be the most difficult character of the movie. She struggles with finding work as a fashion designer, has a rough relationship with Usnavi and does not love her job at the salon. Still, her development is quite good. She changes the most out of everyone. The movie delves into what latinos go through to get through life and what prejudices they face, especially with Nina's story and Sonny's story. However, it could have delved into Nina's story a bit more. What In The Heights shows is that a dream is usually just a dream and that we have to face reality everyday. That being said, it also shows that we do not have let reality suck all the time. We can do what we can to make it better for ourselves and even come up with our own ways of making life better instead of moping. Overall, the tone has bleak moments, but it is an optimistic movie and sometimes, we need a film like this instead of some of the more bleak films out there.As for the rest of the aspects of the movie, the cast delivered. Anthony Ramos as Usnavi is charming as hell. Every time he speaks he is oozing with charisma. Olga Merediz as Claudia is my second favorite person here. She is such a kind character and this performance is energetic, especially when she gets her musical number. It is easily one of the most emotional parts of the film. Corey Hawkins as Benny is a lot of fun and Leslie Grace as Nina played the role perfectly as a troubled woman struggling with college and family. Hawkins and Grace shared a good amount of chemistry as did Ramos and Melissa Barrera as Vanessa. There are some very funny moments of humor that made me smile during the movie. These especially come during the musical numbers with Usnavi's awkward flirting and the crazy visuals. The only flaw narrative-wise is that it could have ended maybe a little earlier. The film is long, but it is really good. By the end, I could feel its length for better or worse.In The Heights is definitely the best movie from the HBO Max and theaters releases so far. It is such an entertaining movie from start to finish with some of the most joyous music I have ever heard. It is also great with storytelling by music rather than the songs just being for fun. They build the characters, the world of the film and the plot. There is a lot to love here, but what makes this movie a bit more special for me is that it was such an experience seeing such an energetic musical like this on the big screen again. It is very different from a lot of the films I see in theaters, but it was definitely worth it. This is the perfect movie to watch during the summer whether it would be at home on HBO Max or in theaters. It is a thoroughly blissful experience.",In the Heights
131,willcrabbe,The definitive summer hit of 2021,10,14 June 2021,"We all watch films and go to the cinema in the hopes of seeing the birth of a classic. In The Heights is one of those films. From the very first shots we are treated to a vibrant, colourful, and creative energy that will bombard our senses for the following two hours.The film is a celebration of culture, community and life itself, finding beauty and colour in the everyday routines and mundanities. We follow everyday people in this immigrant neighbourhood of Washington Heights and have a glimpse into the sueñito (little dream) that each of our main characters holds deeply entrenched in their heart as they work to make it a reality.The cinematography is wonderful and the musical numbers will have you moving in your seat and wanting to join in the exuberant and celebratory dancing of the characters. The music fuses traditional musical theatre numbers with latin flair and a touch of rap and hip-hop. The massive and epically choreographed centrepiece number 96,000 was a personal favourite of mine, alongside Olga Merediz's stunning and tear-jerking solo number ""Paciencia y Fe"".The performances from the cast all round were stellar, with leading man Anthony Ramos putting in a star turn as Usnavi that will definitely turn some heads, and Melissa Barrera great as aspiring fashion designer Vanessa.In The Heights marks a major cornerstone in the modern renaissance and reimagination of the musical and will surely be remembered in the way that the greats of the genre such as West Side Story currently are.An absolute delight on every level. In The Heights is the electrifying film we needed and will be the definitive summer hit of 2021. It's contagious and boisterous energy will inevitably capture audiences hearts worldwide.",In the Heights
132,ramo140,Overhyped and really boring,5,13 June 2021,The best thing about this 2h20m movie was the nod to Hamilton. The lyrics were very weak and the plot was very shallow. The cast was extremely good and fun to watch. The choreography and cinematography was well done. It's no surprise to me now that the Broadway show was relatively unheard of before Hamilton's success. Also i felt there was some subliminal messaging in the movie that encourages migrants to join the army which rubbed me off the wrong way but I could be wrong.,In the Heights
133,reellycynical,Only Thing Missing Were the Unicorns,2,14 June 2021,"I mean, I'm not sure else to say, except this movie was complete Utopian Dog Poop. Pretty funny that, considering where we are as a country right now, with all the decisiveness, racial tensions, mask-wearing, looting, rioting, political hatred, illegal immigrants streaming across the border and impending economic collapse, they come out with this movie.Dancing in the streets; Everyone is smiling; No poverty; No financial stress; No MASKS; Everyone's clothes are perfectly clean and shiny; Everyone's teeth are perfectly straight and Clorox White!!; Everything is perfect in the world.So......... basically........... COMPLETE GARBAGE!Leave it to Hollywood to come out with a movie that misrepresents EVERYTHING that growing up in New York City is REALLY all about. You want to go up to Harlem or out to the Bronx and wander around on any given night at 11pm to 4am? Good luck.If you want to go to the movies and spend $100 for your family of 4 to watch this movie and then walk out holding hands and hugging each other,.... that is FINE BY ME. - but don't for ONE SECOND act like this is REALITY.Good singing?

134,salramirezjr,"Energetic, Rythmic, and Exciting",8,11 June 2021,"The upbeat musical numbers work incredibly well with the story, always bringing a smile to your face. Powerful stories, metaphors, and on-screen chemistry elevate the film beautifully. However, the editing is at times jarring, and the smaller, more intimate musical scenes get old by the end of the film. Perhaps most unfortunate is that our two leads, Anthony Ramos and Melissa Barrera, are actually some of the weakest in the cast and are often outshined by their on-screen counterparts.",In the Heights
135,Lockout_Salties,A well-done and fun musical,7,11 June 2021,"Modern musicals are very hit-or-miss for me: for every masterpiece like La La Land, you get a complete failure like Rent. Thankfully, I'm happy to say that In the Heights is a musical that will probably put a smile on your face and a catchy song in your head.All the essentials are there: solid acting, solid performances, solid direction. But perhaps the most pleasant surprise was the really good score and choreography. I'm all too used to musicals that have a dud song here and there, but I couldn't think of a single one that missed the mark in this film. You would think a song sung by an old woman as she's walking through a subway would be boring, but it's arguably the highlight of the film. I also really liked how basically all the characters in the film were Latino. It's nice to see some really great representation in a film that doesn't feel like they just add people of color to check it off a list.However, the movie is not without its problems. For one thing, the film does drag in places and you do start to feel that 2.5 hour running time. I also didn't really like the ending: I won't spoil it, but it did feel like a cop-out and I wish the film had opted for the more interesting ending instead of the cliche one. Finally, I also thought some of the subplots weren't very well-developed. In particular, the youngest character in the film has one that only comes into play around halfway into it, and there's still only two or three scenes relating to it. With a bit more fleshing out I think these problems could've been fixed, but as it stands it doesn't damper the experience too much.Overall, In the Heights is a good musical that will brighten up your day at least a little. It's not perfect, but the positives within it are enough to outweigh the flaws. It's a solid movie to get anyone in a good mood.Final Score: 72/100.",In the Heights
136,goldenlampshade,An electric movie that radiates authenticity and joy,10,12 June 2021,"One of the best viewing experiences I've had in a while and I got to see it in theaters no less! You really feel the electricity of the movie flow through you sitting there marveling in the spectacle of Washington Heights. Anthony Ramos is a star and once Lin gets the first tear out, which it takes its time to do, it's waterworks all the way till the end. It's representation of latino culture, living in poverty and a No Country for Old Men style look at a quickly disappearing past are handled deftly and authentically. A joyful joyful time.The cleverness of a screenplay that was clearly also a Broadway musical is not to be missed, it was deep and moving and funny enough that the kids in the row behind me the grandma in the row in front and I could all laugh and have it not feel corny. The heart of this movie, about dreams big and small, are comforting and smartly subversive in a way that is so refreshing and makes me want to rewatch it immediately.",In the Heights

Anthony Ramos nails his role and could be a contender at the next Oscars, along with the movie's music.

The music score is perfect (bought it already). It reflects all influences of South American music: salsa, merengue you name it.The ensemble scenes are beautiful with very nice effects as well. I loved the scene at the pool and the ""Carnaval del Barrio"". Very West Side Story as well! For me the one who stole the show is Abuela Claudia. Her solo ""Paciencia y fe"" was an absolute joy.The only negative point is the length of the movie. It's could have been a bit shorter. The story drags a bit after a while but the music keeps you focused. I couldn't wait for them to stop talking and start singing!All the actors were amazing.

It doesn't have the same vibrancy, heart and soul as the Broadway show, and some of it just plodded along aimlessly with no real direction. The storyline was weak and had far too many anachronistic elements that were distracting. It was far from the In the Heights I adored on Broadway. Another thing I noticed....it was just too over-the-top even for a musical, so much so that it was overwhelming and I wanted some of the scenes to just end already. ENOUGH!

Which maybe is the intent and your suppose to enjoy just the music?! Vanessa was choppy and they didn't show any struggle she had to overcome. Her big issue was to get on a train to live 1/2 hour away?? It might be the case of too many sub plots and stories and having a scene for the sake of having a scene.

The respect will lead to every single group or community to feel like home anywhere they go to...Additionally, the movie is really bold on showing every aspect and difficulties of these communities on a introspective and creative way, by including different settings on every song and dance.Consequently, the use of different camera angles, portrays the plurality and complexity of OUR culture, and in this the quantiy within ""Washington Heights"".

This in addition to having too many character loops in the movie. There's NIna and her bf and her father, there doesn't seem to be a ton of conflict there and that side of the movie seems underdeveloped and almost feels like it could've been dropped. Perhaps this was done better in the theatrical broadway production?The heart lies with Usnavi and the main character and narrator, and I really liked Anthony Ramos' performance.Anyhow, it's worth catching for the sights and sounds. Lots of energy. Just could've used a little more editing perhaps.",In the Heights
163,grayner-2,I really wanted to love this film,6,15 June 2021,"So, like many people who loved the musical, I was very eager to see this film, which I watched on HBO because I'm not yet cool with going to a movie theater.Anyway, the first minutes of the opening number were spectacular. Bright and vibrant, a celebration of Washington Heights and Hispanic lives and a community. The characters really make the connection with you in those first minutes and I quickly went from comparing Anthony Ramos to Lin Manuel to accepting AR as Usnavi.But sadly, many things started going downhill from there. Full disclosure - I stopped watching at about the 1 hour mark as I was growing increasingly pissed off at certain things and feared I would give this movie a lower rating. I deserves at least this for its ambition, its passion and its celebration of the lives of people whom you do not see depicted in films often.The good: The musical numbers are amazing and memorable. The characters are sympathetic and the roles are well-acted. There is clear devotion and reverence for the Hispanic community, including shout-outs to Rita, Chita, Sonia Sottomayor and others. The film is visually stunning and you find yourself just mesmerizing by the energy and the movement. The singing is great. And it truly inspires love, admiration and sympathy of this community, most Hispanics from numerous nations or US born and others who are not.The bad: It seems that while so much was put into the musical numbers and an effort to fill up the 2.5 hours of run time, some of the heart of the original musical show was cut out. For example: One of the great relationships in the film is Camila and Kevin. They keep each other in check and have great love for each other, even when things get really bad. One of my favorite songs in the musical is ""Enough"" where Camila chews out both her husband and her daughter for how they handled the college situation and Kevin's treatment of Benny. Now, voila, Kevin is a widower, that relationship and number are gone - From that perspective, I could do without the extended swimming pool scenes if something this important is cut out.More importantly: the Kevin/Benny relationship. In the B-way Musical, it is suggested that K doesn't like B because he is black not brown, not Hispanic and not Spanish-speaking and below the status of the daughter. Most of that is erased from the film - it is just gone. Curious that there are now accusations of colorism in the film - that only light-skinned Latinos were used in the movie. So it's like they wanted to erase the racial element in the show but then were blind to equally big racial elements in the making of the film. The director had the same accusations when making Crazy Rich Asians but apparently didn't get the message.Then we have Nina's Stanford studies. In the original, she is overwhelmed, loses her scholarship, starts working too much and flunks out. Here: they add in an element of racial profiling and that she was searched. Yes, these are important issues to be explored but it seems to me that there were so many important racial elements in the musical that were sanitized and then they blindly just ignore some in making the movie.Or let's take Abuela: One of the highlights of the musical is when she sings Paciencia y Fe - but, at least in the production I saw in Westport CT - She sings the song TO the community and they even act out her words in dance. In the film, it's all in her head. Yes, they have a lovely montage of her experience but it is not connecting with the other younger members of the community. Yes, they all love Abuelita, but the fact this song is sung in isolation further emphasizes the style over substance approach to this movie.And then we have the Dominican Republican. The point of the musical is that Usnavi wants to move to the DR but, at the end, discovers he loves his community in Washington Heights and will stay there - and Nina goes to college, they move the salon a bit further away but we understand the community will continue to exist, albeit at times a bit further apart. Maybe this is resolved later in the film but it seems the major plot thrust is getting Usnavi there and narrating this story to Dominican kids, thereby losing the message of the original. And the Dominican kids all speak flawless English. Do you think in a movie that celebrates Hispanic culture, you could show kids speaking Spanish at least somewhat? In WH, I get it, everybody speaks English, but in the DR?Lottery ticket? So far Abuelita did not win it. In the musical, she wanted to start a new life with Usnavi and his cousin there - but Usnavi changes his mind. All that seems to be gone.Conclusion: Stunning, joyous, with brilliant acts and some magical moments. But they seems to have cut some of the most salient moments for the movie. One feels that they are in some dialogue with West Side Story. The run-time is not justified - after a while, the music and visual splendor start feeling fatiguing and you want things to get real. They do sometimes, but others it feels like filler. It's like a ""death by committee"" thing - let's do numbers ABC but let's cut out key plot elements and characters that made the show so special. I hope it inspires more movies about Hispanic life and cultures but ultimately it feels kind of like a sanitized feel-good film, Maybe Lin has spent too much time over at Disney.",In the Heights

165,fanimator03,In the Heights review: pretty mediocre,5,9 June 2021,I found it to be below average. What was the story? Who was the main character? No narrative. I wasn't exactly sure what the story was when watching it. It has a lot of style with great visuals and musical numbers.,In the Heights

This musical includes and begs you to dive deeper into the culture, not just the Latin culture but the genuine musical culture.IN THE HEIGHTS has been one of the single most fun musical movies I've ever laid eyes on. It's the rare kind of movie magic that captures the essence of the stage musical and amps it up to make sure you don't forget it. There's also much more appropriate level of Lin-Manuel Miranda inclusion, because I'll be the honest one and say he should not have been Alexander Hamilton (Ramos was the obvious choice), but the Piragua guy was the role Lin was meant to play. The watchful eyes of the show's creator being there just enough to not take away from the incredible main characters incredible voices.Stay after the credits for the moment I've all been waiting forGreat fantastic film that I will rewatch as much as I can before it's off the sacred HBO Max.",In the Heights
167,quiqueperique,This is so good! Stop comparing it to Hamilton!,9,21 June 2021,"Recently a lot of new people are getting into musicals and into Lin Manuel Miranda's work because of the ""Hamilton boom"" and so I've seen a lot of reviews saying ""this is no Hamilton... it doesn't compare to what Lin did with Hamiton... This style doesn't work as it does in Hamilton..."" Of course is not gonna be the same!! This is so obviously different!I hate that just because it has Lin Manuel Miranda's attached it has to be as big as Hamilton and of course, if you compare them probably you're gonna like one more over the other but they are so different and this movie deserves its own credit because its doing its own thing and it works so well.After that rant, sorry but I had to say it, I will tell you that If you're a fan of the original play it totally gives it source justice, the changes they did are understandable and work very well, except the adittion of the new girl in the salon (didn't even remember the name) totally useless and forgettable.Only if you tottally hate hate musicals then skip this one, altough if you're in that demographic I don't even know why you would even be considering watching this XD.",In the Heights

I had already seen an In The Heights performance, but it was an amateur one so I thought that's why I didn't like it.But now I realize, after watching Hamilton and this movie, that my problem is that I don't like Lin Manuel Miranda's musicals in general. With Moana there was enough variety in song styles, and the non-musical parts of the movie were great.But when I am bombarded with this style of rap combined with high pitched almost screams, in what seems to be an endless 2.5 hour song, I can't enjoy it. Add that to the fact that the story is just a series of events and characters scattered all around the place, without an actual plot, and it becomes, for me, a really boring monotonous experience.I'm happy for the people that have enjoyed this kind of movie, because I would like to see more tries at musicals coming from Hollywood. But even being latino (mexican) myself, and having good memories from my visit to New York City, I just could not have a good time with this movie.",In the Heights

Symbolically it's a great movie cause you get to watch something that you've lived before and For those who Are non-immigrant it's a wonderful opportunity to learn and understand our struggles but I would have like more story development and fewer song but well worked so you can listen to them over and over like we all did for The greatest showman(PS: I now hate those songs cause I've listened to them too many time now ahaha.,In the Heights

The story of Usnavi is obviously the main story but he is just the storyteller for the others. His own story tells about wanting to leave, but then doesnt. Thats it. The other storylines are about the same span.There are two romantic storylines but there is absolutely no arc anywhere. No character development whatsoever.Then theres the music, it kinda all felt like one long song with too much speakingsinging. The only one I can remember now is the lame Piragua song that Lin Manuel obviously wrote in for himself.Maybe if you're latin or from new york or for sure from Washington Heights yourself you get the vibe without any storyline, but it didnt work for me.",In the Heights

183,petereviews,A Musical Celebration of Community,8,2 July 2021,"(Disclaimer: This was the first movie I watched in theatres since the start of COVID which may have caused a positive bias before the film had even started... take that as you will.)The Pros: Besides the popcorn, the magic of the movies is strongly associated to being transported to another world on the big screen, being engrossed by the plot and its characters, and being part of a theatre community who can also share this emotional journey.As one of the first movies released since theatres re-opened, In the Heights is a joyous celebration of community with likeable characters and uplifting messages that welcome viewers back; in addition, its elaborate choreography, spectacular direction, and vibrant colours simply beg to be seen on the big screen.The movie has several jaw-dropping numbers particularly in the first half, whether it is the emotional solo of ""Paciencia y Fe"" or the catchy tune with jawdropping choreography of ""96 000"".Overall, the mix of comedy and emotion in the movie works well and the characters are likeable. Particular standouts in this department include the loving elderly ""abuela"" Claudia, the college struggles of Nina (and her father's sacrifices to try and make her succeed). While the protagonist Usnavi's journey goes a bit downhill (see the cons), he is overall charming and funny even though I am not quite sure he works as the lead.The Cons: Primarily, the biggest drawback of the film is that the second half starts to drag and there are three different moments where the film could have ended but kept going. What makes this particularly baffling is that there are several characters and subplots which could have been cut to easily fix the flow of the movie.While Nina's college struggles are compelling, the film pairs her in a romantic subplot that remains very underdeveloped throughout the film. Lin Manuel Miranda pops in from time to time as comedic relief, which while funny, adds absolutely nothing to the plot. Interesting potential side plots (gentrification of the neighbourhood, DACA protests) get brought up and never expanded on, while certain dimensions of characters (Vanessa's fashion dreams) never gets expanded on... the list goes on.One final negative but while the romantic chemistry between Usnavi and Vanessa (arguably the two leads) starts off strong, by the end it feels that the film is just adding unnecessary conflict to pad the run time. Also, Vanessa by the end of the film comes off as childish, encouraging and succeeding for Usnavi to give up his lifelong dreams literally overnight... just rushed storytelling there.CONCLUSION: While the con section may have been long, they were by no means film-breaking and this was still a very pleasant movie. You could feel the passion behind the camera while watching and the energy was undoubtedly infectious. If you absolutely can't watch musicals, stay clear but otherwise, I strongly recommend to grab a ticket.",In the Heights

At the end of the day this musical is simply too much fun, with the kind of catchy song and dance numbers you would come to expect from Lin-Manuel Miranda. Anthony Ramos does a fine job in the role of Usnavi and from him right on down the rest of the cast, everyone turns in strong performance to accompany the beautiful visuals and energetic pace.

193,blake-blamar,Well it was okay with more pluses than minuses,7,17 June 2021,"So tonight Marla and I went to see In The Heights at the downtown Odeon theatre. Social distancing worked very well, actually for introverts like us it kept people at a nice extra long arm's distance.A quick hopefully non-spoiler review. I really like the stage version of the musical In The Heights. Seeing the musical on stage and seeing it on film are two entirely different things. So I found the stage version stronger emotionally but the film version is so much grander in scale.What stands out for me most is the dancing. This is a dancers show, even when they have big dancers like me, it is great to see everyone moving together so nicely and meaningful. And oh the many kinds of dances that were portrayed. Pop and Lock, Hip Hop, Salsa, Merengue, two-step, Ballet, and many more. Although no tap. (that might be a spoiler, sorry.)
The singing is very well done, especially of note to me is Olga Merediz in the role of Abuela Claudia. She has a great second act number.Technically there are some knock your eyes out cinematography moments, some ""how did they do that"", ""some why did they do that"", and some that was just the beauty of Nueva York.In the Heights is a film I would recommend if you love musicals, singing, especially dancing, and there is nothing that is overtly sexual, violent (no gun fights or car chases), and a whole lot of love, family, and home.",In the Heights

Cho. The film provides viewers a reminder of why Miranda is so respected in all communities of Hollywood as he as a mastered skill in developing a plot with strong intrigue and emotion through the beauty of music. Following up on his success of Crazy Rich Asians, Cho once again immerses the viewers into a strong, beautiful and passionate environment that adds on to the film even more and tells a truly heartfelt story. In The Heights has a story to tell at every second of the film, and with a lengthy run time in 143 minutes, viewers never feel bored or as if things are being dragged on. Every scene and shot in the film has a purpose that allows for an entire community to have their own story and purpose that creates an audience attachment to each character and for the community as a whole. From the lyrics, texture and instrumentals of the music to the eye-grabbing set design and perfect plot and choreography, this film has the power to make audiences laugh, cheer and cry while also uniting all communities and celebrating diversity and life.",In the Heights

If you've seen Moana, you might appreciate the clear narrative purpose of it's songs, their dosing and simply their composition. 'In the Heights' fails on these points though.So this is just my opinion, but for a movie or musical, a good song has a clear message and narrative purpose. Be it to make clear a characters intent or state of mind, or to unveil a specific plot twist or something of the sorts. In 'In the Heights' however, songs jump from subject to subject; from a persons background to the situation another person finds themselves in, to romantic aspirations, to life beyond The Heights, etc. They tried to cover to much content in most songs, and it just leaves the senses overloaded.Not helping those senses is that most songs are just too high strung; they have a constant high energy and intensity as if every line is the highlight of both the song and the movie. There is no pacing or ease, no breaks or just a moment where they shut up and give the music a moment to breathe, which makes the watching experience rather exhausting.The acting itself is good, the story is cute, but the movie aims to be a musical and in that it just fails.",In the Heights

211,seedoeatreview,"Big, colourful & fun its a bright shining star in a world filled with dreary, dark movies!",8,12 June 2021,"If you mention musical movies to me I'll probably start rolling my eyes. I didn't particularly enjoy watching La La Land and the thought of having to sit through Russell Crowe warbling in Les Miserables absolutely terrifies me. But I have a confession to make in that the In The Heights movie was an absolute joy to witness. Uplifting, colourful and fun, it's the type of film that will leave you dancing in your cinema seat and smiling from ear to ear.Based on the hit Broadway show of the same name and created by current 'it boy' Lin-Manuel Miranda (Hamilton, Mary Poppin's Returns), In the Heights is a very down-to-earth story told in a big, bombastic, spectacular way. Set in the New York borough of Washington Heights it's a story told through the eyes of Usnavi (Anthony Ramos), a small-time bodega owner with dreams of owning a bar on the beaches of the Dominican Republic where his parents once lived. But Usnavi isn't the only one with big dreams on this block. Hairdresser Vanessa (Melissa Barrera) wants to move to downtown New York to open a fashion business, Nina (Leslie Grace) wants to attend Stamford to become a successful Lawyer, while Usnavi's young cousin Sonny (Gregory Diaz IV) just wants to have enough money to attend school to get a good education. As we soon discover, all the people in this little community have big dreams but all also have something holding them back from achieving it. Over the course of this two-and-a-half-hour movie we sing, dance, rejoice, and mourn with them all, as they do their best to overcome their fears and finally start believing in themselves to achieve the success they crave.THE GOODWhat a surprising delight this film turned out to be. The songs are catchy, the screen is alive with colour and the choreography for the many dance scenes is off the charts. Even the surliest movie viewer will find a song or dance number they'll fall in love with. It's a simple story that's been made better by the magical musical Miranda touch and helped immensely by great direction from Jon M. Chu (Crazy Rich Asians). And what really helped my enjoyment of the story was that all the characters were so likable that you can't help but barrack for them as they search for a way to achieve their dreams.THE BADIn yet another instance where a director seems to have forgotten to use a film editor, In The Heights clocks in at a completely unnecessary 146 minutes. My movie buddy and I discussed several scenes that weren't needed, especially Lin-Manuel Miranda's character Piraguero who seems to have been created so he can get his head on screen. His character actually has nothing really to do with the story but manages to squeeze out a couple of songs and a lot of screen time with the only reasoning being that it will help sell movie tickets. It was also slightly disappointing to realise that some of the characters didn't even manage to finish their story arcs in this exorbitant amount of movie viewing time. So as much as I may praise director Chu I feel he may have faltered in some areas too.THE UGLYI can't believe that this film was turned down by so many movie studios because they only thought it would be successful with a Latino star like Jennifer Lopez or Shakira playing a role. It has taken from 2008 up until now to be produced and a big thumbs-up should be given to Warner Brothers for taking a chance on it and releasing it with unknown actors in the lead roles. After watching In The Heights I couldn't see J-Lo or Shakira doing a better job than the amazing young actors in the film who all deliver amazing performances.In The Heights is a bright and shining star in the middle of a dark and dreary time in the current world we live in. It may not be the perfect film, but the talent on display, the music, and the colour all brought a big smile to my face and I'm betting it will do the same for you too!",In the Heights

214,maztergamer,Good movie that most people will enjoy,8,16 July 2021,"In The Heights is a new movie adaptation of a musical from Lin-Manuel Miranda. About a year ago I decided to watch Hamilton on Disney +. Though I had heard the play was good from word of mouth, I was still skeptical. I probably underestimated what a rap musical about Alexander Hamilton could do. I was pleasantly surprised and knowing that In The Heights was also from a musical from Lin Manuel Miranda and that the movie starred someone in who was in Hamilton (Anthony Ramos) I was very excited. I was not disappointed.The acting in this movie was good, really good even. There are no award worthy performances but everyone fills their role and no one stands out as not being good. The performance I probably liked the most was from Jimmy Smits who plays the father of one of the characters. The conflict about returning to Stanford with him and his daughter is interesting and adds more to the story.Technically this film is also well made. There is well done cinematography and editing. Plus the music is good. I have seen musicals with better music but this music is still very good. Just like Hamilton there is a good mix of some rapping and some singing.The core story revolves around a community in Washington Heights. In this community the streets are made of music unlike most communities where the streets are made of asphalt There is a blackout that could tear apart the community (not really a spoiler they show text on the screen saying ""(insert amount of time) before blackout"" pretty consistently). You have other side plotlines but this is really what the story is about. I don't want to spoil anything but the movie goes for a Wizard Of Oz type message. My only problem was that it could get a bit corny at points but that wasn't too often and it didn't bother me too much.This movie is a satisfying watch that most people will probably enjoy.8/10.",In the Heights

217,jordanjanssen,The feel-good hit of the summer,9,9 June 2021,"Yes, the headline of this review is a cliché, but it's totally true!I received tickets to an advanced screening thanks to Sky TV. I knew VERY little about the film other than it's the first musical from Lin-Manuel Miranda of ""Hamilton"" fame.The film is a fast-paced heady mix of Rent, Fame, and West Side Story in terms of style, and that's not a bad thing. It's almost nonstop singing and dancing and very engrossing.The story is fairly light and fluffy, not too taxing on the brain, which is just what I needed in my first cinema visit in more than 18 months.There were several times that a musical number finished and I REALLY wanted to break into applause, especially after Abuela's big number which was powerful and visually great. Unfortunately, being British and in the UK, we really don't applaud in the cinema.The only criticism I have is that it is overly long, at 2 hours 23 minutes, yet I don't know what could or should be cut from it. It would have been better to be round the 1:55 mark.This film is the first of a run of big musicals coming out in 2021, it has set a VERY high bar and it will be very difficult for the other musicals to top it.The biggest problem this film has at present is getting bums on seats during the COVID pandemic. If it's to do the big business it deserves, I would recommend rereleasing it in the autumn - because this film deserves to be seen, and seen on a big screen.Support the film industry, go and see this film in the cinema (safely) and strap in for the ride!",In the Heights

The casting director stuck with only light skin latinos despite the fact the lead character is Dominican and the rest of the cast is from all over. This is a very inauthentic representation of Washington Heights NYC.It's not too surprising. It's expected from Hollywood to not include the African diaspora. Which is ironic because that's what provided the salsa, reggaeton, and hip hop present in this film.John Chu and Lin Emmanuel should have known better.

221,chowjoe,In The Middles,5,14 June 2021,"I'm old. My favorite movie musical is MY FAIR LADY, not because of the music, a lot of which was memorable, but because of the exquisite production values, the great lead performances and the play upon which the musical is based - PYGMALION, one of the greatest pieces of writing in (and about) the English language.So now we have the film version of IN THE HEIGHTS. I never saw the original stage production, so I have nothing to compare it to. I did see the ""movie"" version of HAMILTON, which was very impressive, although I was a little bothered by what I thought was Lin Manuel Miranda's limited melodic vocabulary. This is again evident with his score for ITH. After spending 140 minutes watching this production, I fail to remember a single tune or even line of lyric. Every song was big, vibrant but...ehh. Was there even a tune sung in a minor key? Was there anything acoustically pared down that projected a sense of intimacy, even for intimate scenes? I'm afraid not. As typical of today's Broadway, there was a sameness to the vocal performances and even performers' voices. If I closed my eyes, I wouldn't be able to tell any of the singers apart, aside from whether it was male or female. Even the abuela character in her solo number sounded young and brash rather than wise and soulful.A number of songs were well staged. I especially liked one where Benny and Nina are dancing on the side of the building (an homage to ROYAL WEDDING?). But all in all, I found the whole thing lacking in substance. There was almost no conflict in the story. I don't get why all the critics are falling over themselves in praise of this mildly passable entertainment in which nothing and no one really stands out. Then again, LA LA LAND was no great shakes either. Hope Spielberg does better with WEST SIDE STORY, though I'm not holding my breath.",In the Heights

232,wisdommurray-35115,"""Paciencia y fe..."" ""Patience and faith...""",10,13 June 2021,"In the Heights, I'm sure a majority of theatre people can agree, is both a gem and a masterpiece in the theatre world. Lin-Manuel Miranda's first major musical now adapted into a major film set the way for musicals in the 21st century to be more influenced by hip-hop/pop music than traditional showtunes. So when Warner Bros announced that a film adaptation was gonna be made, I never felt more excited. It was the adaptation I was both excited and worried for. It had to be done right.I sat in this theatre, I laughed, danced in my seat, and sobbed like a child. Jon M. Chu and the fantastic ensemble of actors did something wonderful to Miranda's show. The film felt so separate from the stage production that it became its own thing. The film wasn't afraid to be real to the world around them, but also be an in-your-face Hollywood musical.I must give a shout-out to both Anthony Ramos (Usnavi) and Olga Merediz (Abuela Claudia) who both gave honest, powerful performances that made you want to reach out and connect with them more. But the ensemble as a whole was just brilliant in every way. The chemistry between the characters, the frustrations, and so on were just so true to themselves and very engaging.Jon M Chu's direction is what ultimately shines in this film. When doing musical numbers, it's so fast paced and colorful and out there that you get so entranced in the details around the character's singing; like in It Won't be Long Now when Vanessa is running in a street with colorful drapes floating above and Paciencia y fe using an entire subway to tell the tale of Abuela towards her peaceful passing. All of this was done through the genius that is Jon M Chu and I hope the industry keeps giving him musicals to direct, because he is what the world needs.Overall, this adaptation is a masterpiece in the modern musical movie. Please watch this film to see fantastic representation in the Latinx community, but also to see a touching story of a neighborhood that feels more connected through the people than anything you will ever experience.This is the film of our lifetime.",In the Heights

Prove me wrong. See?It's a brilliantly produced film that lacks musical cohesiveness.

I used to live in the Bronx and I love NY but i don't understand how giving up this dream of living on the Island to stay in a not great place is supposed to be inspiring?

Overall it was such a strong movie and the music was great and lively, felt like you were in the streets with them singing. I think everyone should give this movie a chance even if you're not a fan of musicals. It has story and heart-warming moments. The elaborate musical numbers make you feel like it's an action movie because it is so well done and the movement is infectious. The editing is great and not tacky even little designs of animation add something special to it and it's not a lot which makes it seem so special. A lot of people may have issues with casting, direction, writing, etc. But people are bound to pick at something rather than enjoy it for it is especially if it is done right like this movie.

The multiple stories are easy to follow and secondary to the main character which is Washington Heights itself. It's about people wanting to move out of the Heights, wanting to do something about their lives, but their heart and soul belong to the Heights. And the stereotypes in no way insult the hispanic community. This is a feel-good film. I don't understand the negative reviews, like people have already hated it before seeing it. Maybe they don't like the director? Or they don't like musicals? Or they expect a dramatic plot because they are not used to a nonlinear narrative? There is nothing here to hate, but I guess haters have their reasons. In any case, I thought it was entertaining and it went by fast.",In the Heights
241,erinsm,Overall an excellent film,9,11 July 2021,"If you're a fan of the musical soundtrack, or the stage version of In The Heights, you'll be pleased to know that the film retains most of the charm of the musical. Anthony Ramos is fantastic at channeling the character of Usnavi and the challenges he faces, and his cadence and delivery come across well. Corey Hawkins' Benny is smooth, but it's astoundingly clear at moments throughout the film that Hawkins is trying too hard to channel his predecessor, OBC Benny portrayer Christopher Jackson (who has cameos in the film as the rival to Lin-Manuel Miranda's piraguero, Mister Softee).I found Daphne Rubin-Vega endearing but somewhat dry, and at times straight up annoying as Daniela, the salon lady. Dascha Polanco also failed to impress me as Cuca, a new salon worker with very little to add to the narrative. Perhaps one of the best numbers in the movie adaptation is ""Paciencia y Fe"" (Patience and Faith) where a dying Abuela Claudia recounts her childhood in La Vibora, Cuba and how she and her mother came to America seeking a better life.If you had any doubts about Miranda playing the neighborhood shaved ice seller, he immediately puts them to rest during the show stopping solo number ""Piragua"". Ultimately the film amazes, but falls flat on quite a few notes and storylines including representation of the DACA legislation and a shallow, veiled attempt at LGBT+ representation marred by religious jokes in poor taste.Nonetheless, this is a film I would see again if I had the opportunity, and one I still plan to add to my collection when it is released on DVD.",In the Heights

Right from the start, however, I could see that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. First off, there is just about no variety in the music. It's all Latin music and rap, with very few memorable songs and moments. The plot is riddled with holes, as we attempt to follow the ""stories"" of several undeveloped characters. It is slow, long, and difficult to follow. The ending (I won't spoil it) is very feel good and happy, and overall there were many moments where I found myself rooting for the characters and the city.

257,bohemianbrunnette13,Miranda's privilege and bias under the limelight,5,18 June 2021,"Here is what I will say:I am a fan of Broadway musicals, especially Hamilton, and Lin-Manuel Miranda himself. But I also believe that it is no accident that there is a lack of latinx cast members who would ""fit the bill"" for what Lin was trying to sell.Of course he apologized for the lack of individuals who were darker complected or had an afro, but what else do you expect of someone who is so violently swayed by the public that he would not do so? He tries to speak for his culture, but it is evident that his privilege shrouded his view of the world. His mother was a clinical psychologist, his father a Democratic party consultant. Considerably luckier, in a grand position that would propel him to a good school and a grand future. So for me, it feels odd watching him make a film saying ""Here is OUR struggle"" having been able to suck a silver spoon growing up. It feels like the equivalent of someone going on a mission trip to Africa to only post photos on Instagram for virtue signaling alone.But I digress.The movie itself could have been at least thirty minutes shorter, because so many scenes felt too forced and uncessary. The opening number of ""In the Heights"" was exhilarating. Families rising early with the day, people going to work with a smile. That was the movie that I was looking forward to. But too many characters were expanded on, and it felt exhausting to watch. Not one specific character, scene, or song stood out because they all began piling on top of one another, not letting the viewer breathe to enjoy the story itself.A notable comparison that did a better job at this was ""The Greatest Showman"". The script allowed the story to be built slowly through actions rather than words, and the climax would be the song that did NOT follow immediately after a minute later.The only real notable moment after the opening was the ""Paciencia y Fe"" which beautifully articulates Claudia's story both verbally and visually. Her death felt like a punch in the gut, because she clearly had an impact on everyone in the story. Her character as well as the visuals resulted in my review the five stars.I sincerely believe that given some stronger editing of scenes, and a fresh perspective from other people from Washington Heights could have served this movie considerably well.",In the Heights

The music in the movie was fantastic and the actors who played their role in the movie were fantastic too. Anthony Ramos killed it as Usanavi with both his singing and dancing skills he put to the role. I'm so happy Lin Manuel Miranda chose him to play him because he was the perfect fit for it.

The wide open spaces of the streets can't be 'filled up' by dancers the way a Broadway stage can be. Reminder to ALL - this is a FILM and films have their own set of artistic rules. To rate this above 7 for me would have required a more focused story without so many characters and subplots.

But I did love the rhythms and the dancing, I definitely wish there was more of that out there in the world.Nevertheless, the story is boring. There is no story really, at least not a story in the traditional sense temporarily or argumentative. The story does not progresses, it does not move anywhere.

The best aspects were the overall story it told and some of musical dance numbers, e.g. The pool scene. The music itself was not at the same level as Hamilton, but it was still good. The characters were mostly very good with the best performed by Melissa Barrera and Olga Merediz. Anthony Ramos also does a very good job, but some aspects of the writing for his character were off. Also, some aspects of the side stories were too contrived and didn't add anything to the overall movie.

Everything wrapped perfectly with Latino Spanish hip hop musical numbers and energetic dance choreography, made this movie look alive and colorful.Also, the cinematography and visual look great and eye-catching. You can feel the summer vibe party here. The production design also good, nice set. The editing and camera movement was amazing too. I love the part when Nina and Benny were dancing up and down over the building walls. Wow!Even though, we'll enjoying the vibrant of song and dance, the storyline is the weakness. Of course its talked about culture, diversity, and community issues. I just don't know why, but at some point, the story toward the end about family, friends, dream things is 'a bit' cliche to me personally. Also technically, the duration is overly long. I guess 2 hours is much better, the story drags a bit in the middle. However, its still great storytelling, and this weakness is just minor flaws. And one more, personally, I'm not really suck in to the music, its not memorable enough. I loved the first music 'Washington Heights'.Overall In the Heights is a joyful drama musical with bright visual, uplifting music, and energetic dance, indeed, its not perfect, the story is 'a bit' cliche, duration overly long, but still entertaining and so much fun.

There was not a single song I could leave signing like from great musicals.I saw this movie on a Dolby screen, which made it extra special. The visuals and colors are actually breath-taking. I actually lost on my breathe on a couple shots and moments. The actors performances, voices, the direction, art direction, cinematography, sound, editing, are amazing and in perfect sync and the entire film is like a dance.Also this movie version is far superior to the play, which is usually the opposite of what people say about play adaptions.

People are allowed to post a ""critical"" review of a film or broadcast/streaming show and lately it just feels like there's so much hate piled on just about anything being offered. IN THE HEIGHTS was never intended to be some kind of earth-changing socio-political offering to ponder alongside your Anderson Coopers' or Tucker Carlsons' op-eds. It's 1) a musical, 2) escapism, and 3) meant to be enjoyed for enjoyment's sake. Period. Was it ever presented as something supposedly encapsulating the state of Latino America? I don't think so. Did it use a specific New York City neighborhood and the people who live there as a jumping off point to illustrate the joy and love that can exist for us all, in spite of the hardships thrown in our path? Well, when you put it like that...Look, this film may not be equal to the Broadway production and, for that matter, the music or acting or dancing or direction may not even be your cup if tea, but come on, people. Try having a couple hours of fun escaping from all the craziness we've created for ourselves in this world, instead of directing your anger/frustration/faux-criticism at something that had the primary intent of trying to help your leave it all behind for a few hours.So...Is IN THE HEIGHTS the ""must see"" ""most amazing"" ""incomparably incomparable"" musical of all time? No. Is it a terrific film that'll make you feel just a little bit better during these trying times? Absolutely! I suggest, if your reading this to help you decide whether you should see this little gem or not, that you ignore the hate-filled ""critical"" postings and give it a chance. You might be surprised that you even remember how to smile, or tear up a little, or even (God forbid!) enjoy it.",In the Heights
281,mofo_rob,A whole lot of happy,9,13 June 2021,"With the huge success of Hamilton, hearing Lin-Manuel Miranda's name attached to anything means you know you're in for a good time. In The Heights successfully celebrates Latino culture, set to the back drop of Washington Heights and has some outstanding musical numbers.Jon M. Chu directs this movie adaptation of the musical written by Miranda which opened on Broadway in 2008, fabulously paying homage to the Manhattan distract of Washington Heights. The story is told through the eyes of Usnavi, played by Miranda's Hamilton co-star, Anthony Ramos, a loveable, hardworking young man with aspirations of selling up his bodega to make it back home to the Dominican Republic and open his own beach bar. He falls for Vanessa (Melissa Barrera), who works at the beauty salon nearby and is struggling to make her way into the fashion industry. An adjacent love story running throughout sees Benny (Corey Hawkins) rekindle a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Nina (Leslie Grace) who feels the weight of the community on her shoulders after making it to Stanford.Patience and faith are values running throughout this and each core character experiences troubles at times in holding onto these while striving to fulfil their dreams. Each one of them are so likeable and as a viewer you easily build connections to them. There are some familiar faces as part of the ensemble. Stephanie Beatriz and Dascha Polanco are so entertaining and enjoyable to watch and Lin-Manuel himself makes a few fun cameos. You'll find yourself falling in love with Abuela Claudia (Olga Merediz) and Gregory Diaz IV deserves his very own standing ovation as Usnavi's cousin, Sonny. A cheeky nod to Hamilton didn't go unnoticed either and hearing 'You'll Be Back' playing over the phone while Kevin is kept on hold was very much appreciated.The musical numbers are bright and vibrant with a perfect blend of hip hop, r'n'b and Latino beats. The opening number 'In The Heights' is joyous and hooks your attention straight away. The production on some of them are incredible, in particular '96,000' is simply show stopping as it gives the ultimate example of what the perfect song and setting can do. It also holds a moment where Gregory Diaz IV shines with some very impressive rap skills. 'When You're Home' is another which is shot beautifully and really showcases a place Miranda clearly holds very dearly. 'When The Sun Goes Down' is a beautiful mid tempo r'n'b ballad and the visual styling to this song really reminded me of The Greatest Showman's Rewrite The Stars.With covid restrictions easing and the slow return of live musical theatre, this is the perfect way to reintroduce the experience to the public. In The Heights is an uplifting story, tackling prejudice and affirms the power of believing in yourself, whilst showing off all things involved in Latino culture. It's full of charm, romance and packs huge amounts of happy.",In the Heights

There are huge chunks of the film where the plot stays completely stagnant and the characters end up singing their way to the next scene.On the subject of the characters, I honestly can't remember who any of them are. It's impossible to really care about them and their narratives. A number of the ""actors"" can't act and appear to be extremely wooden.To be honest, I could go on and on here about how poor this film is and all the issues it has, but it's very difficult to put into words just how grey it is.

291,maggymaytay,The emotion of the original musical is missing,6,15 June 2021,"As a lover of musical theatre, I am delighted that ""In the Heights"" is getting the full motion picture treatment. Unfortunately, the changes made to the book of the original musical are for the worse.Key songs that get the viewers invested in the relationship between Nina and Benny as well as Abuela Claudia and Usnavi are missing. Though each of the actors is cast well as far as singing and dancing talent, the chemistry between the romantic relationships and the community as a whole never feels like it really comes together. The story beats feel inorganic and unearned here when they don't listening the Broadway cast recording.Director Jon Chu puts together some amazingly flashy choreography in the key songs (In the Heights, 96,000, The Club, Carnaval del Barrio) but the balance between these characteristically over-the-top numbers and the more slowed down, emotional pieces is off. This makes the big numbers feel tedious, when really, they shouldn't! I love seeing musicals on the big screen - so why do I feel this way? A key example is the end sequence between Nina and Benny (""When the Sun Goes Down"") when the director has them dancing on the side of a building, no care for gravity. I admire Chu's alternate, surrealist vision for this number - while beautiful, it feels like it comes out of nowhere for the tone of this film. And I honestly would have rather seen focusing close-ups on Nina and Benny's faces as they sing about their newfound commitment to each other.As far as the plot, some inexplicable changes and shifts were made from the original musical to make room for a half-hatched DACA plot. (Sonny reveals that he is undocumented, but as he is the cousin of the Dominican-American Usnavi, this didn't really make sense to me.) Sonny and Nina are shown attending a protest against ""kicking out the dreamers"". In the aftermath of Abuela's death, the community's sense of coming-together to appreciate her in the touching ""Alabanza"" also, for some reason, involves protest signs that feel unearned and illogical.Abuela Claudia's moment to shine (""Pacienca y Fe"") has her examining the choice to return to her homeland or to claim her identity as an American. However, the decision feels very low-stakes because at this point, the viewer doesn't know that she has the winning lottery fortune and thus the new freedom to decide where to go. This as a central conflict and then of the film is dropped until the final moments when Usnavi has to face this choice himself. But the beats feel unconnected here despite the film's overlong run time.I will be watching again to see if I was simply too cynical the first time around, but I spent today listening to the always-sublime original Broadway cast recording and I think I'll stick to that.",In the Heights

293,cmoskito,"Incredibly stylistic, banger soundtrack, but lacking a story",8,12 June 2021,"As is the case with even the stage play, In The Heights is not the most compelling narrative. As I expected, the story in the movie was just as insubstantial. However, I can say for sure that I was happily surprised by this movie. The movie absolutely oozes style, from the camera movement to the way that diegetic sound is integrated with the music and sound effects in the song. The choreography is fun to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The editing is sort of hit or miss with this movie. It goes back and forth between stretches of good editing, then to these sections of super jumpy editing (especially in the songs), where you would be hard pressed to find a single shot longer than 3 seconds. This works to the movie's advantage at times, there's a few very satisfying jump-cut sequences that are in time with the music, but there were also some really jarring cuts when there didn't need to be. If you saw the trailer, the huge dance choreography on the street looks cool, but in the movie it cuts like 5 times during a push-in on that dance scene and it makes it harder to appreciate the choreo. That being said, aside from a few sequences, the editing didn't bother me too much.Anthony Ramos killed it as Usnavi, and he somehow drove home somewhat emotional narrative beats even more so than when I saw it on stage. Seeing Lin and Marc Antony was cool. Melissa Barrera and Leslie Grace were also pretty good, but the character who I think stole every scene he was in was Corey Hawkins as Benny. He had such an infectious energy, and a singing voice to match it.Lin-Manuel Miranda, while not a great singer, is a killer composer, especially with his trademark blend of showtunes and hip-hop, and In the Heights has always been one of his greatest achievements. The songs flow really well, and while they're not all incredible (as is the case with Hamilton), the stand out ones do certainly stand out and leave you wanting to download the soundtrack. I already mentioned this, but I can't stress how incredibly stylistic this movie is when it comes to choreographing the non-dance elements of the songs. The blend of music with the diegetic interactions between the characters and the real world, as well as sound effects timed with the music make every song a blast to watch, and I would argue make the movie better than even the Hamilton 'movie' (although it's not entirely fair to compare them).This movie isn't perfect, but the weak narrative and sometimes odd editing choices are easily balanced out, if not outweighed by the style, flair, acting, and music. 8/10.",In the Heights

Here everyone sings and dances for no apparent reason.As IMDB users point out, the songs tend to blend together. Therefore not one standout song results - a major musical film detriment. This however will not deter teenaged Broadway fans from memorizing the rap lyrics since age prevents critical point-of-comparison skills.The plot/s are all entirely clichéd.The chorus of attentive children are presented as sycophants who are enthralled at every unimpressive story development.This is a feel-good movie for some who believe in the legitimacy of race privilege, since nearly the entire cast is non-privileged, allowing privlege-believers to feel good and virtuous.Its mentioned at least twice that The Heights inhabitants are invisible, a highly dubious conceit given that the entire population is consistent and dominate every aspect of their own existence.The semi-veiled suggestion that this population is oppressed, are strangely the most singing-est, dancing-est, happiest group of oppressed people I've ever seen.Finally for a group of people diminished by the American system, they all obviously covet the most cherished aspect of it, the American Dream of success.

310,curious-31675,Really? This is 2021???,2,16 June 2021,"I wanted to like this so much. Good pedigree but almost painful to watch. This movie is a mess: not one song you could take home, the book is muddled at best, the camera work is awful - if I'm watching a big musical number and I don't have a clear view of the dancing what's the point of the choreography? - and it is in dire need of a decent editor. It's a cliche but what a massive waste of talent. Before my spouse fell asleep he said the talk-singing is Rent-ish but that's way too high a compliment...and it just goes on forever with no focus or development of the characters or storylines. The awkward nods to the current political climate fall flat especially considering that there are very few shades of color on display here. The light-skinned politics Spike Lee tried to blow up decades ago (in a bad musical among many films) are still with us and vividly on display in the incredibly beige cast. You can't have it both ways but this film does neither.",In the Heights

314,evedyball,boring but all worthwhile for sunny the messiah,6,9 July 2021,"First of all mans was literally named after a boat and every time anyone said his name it made me laugh. Second of all lin manuel miranda tried to make himself relevant into every aspect of this film. His role was useless, his song was useless, his life is useless. There were too many plots and there was no overarching plot. They tried to make the blackout a huge thing with a countdown but it was hardly relevant. The old lady abuela would have died anyway power cut or not. The romance plots were predictable but also took so long to flourish to the point where i was bored. All the songs in the first quarter sounded exactly the same. Liked the pool dancing scene. Sunny is an enigma of an actor - his dancing is incredible, his voice is angelic, and i really wished to see him star in his own film. However, i am confused on his age as he kept hitting on grown women. The costumes were absolutely rubbish. Vanessa is supposed to be an aspiring fashion designer, so where is the fashion? Her clothes were ill fitted and patterns clashed. What is nina's obsession with rainbow crochet tops? It seems to be the only thing she wears and it's frankly boring. The only plus of the film apart from king sunny was anthony ramos, although he sounded exactly like lin manuel miranda when he sung which brought back traumatising memories of my hamilton obsession in 2018. Overall was a feel good film but was dull and had large plot holes.",In the Heights

It was only hinted at; a shame for sure, but the only thing I didn't like. Other than that, I love every last moment of it.The funniest thing I've found that's sorta meta is Lin Manuel Miranda casually smacking his towel against a Mr. Softee truck being operated by Christopher Jackson, a fellow colleague who (played Benny and) made a name with Lin with amazing musicals.",In the Heights

317,scallywag-42099,Disappointing.,6,20 June 2021,"As a musical theatre and LMM fan I was pretty excited for this movie, I knew nothing about the musical going in and wanted to experience it for the first time on the big screen. It started off pretty good, but it all went downhill from there.First of all, I often felt that the music was louder than the vocals, this was a problem for me because obviously the lyrics are very important in a musical, and often the characters were drowned out by the music and difficult to understand.The characters seemed half-formed, and around half of them had absolutely no affect on the story at all, just a side love-story that I wasn't sure I cared about, I heard that they cut some songs from the Broadway show, so perhaps they would fill in what was missing here.The limited special effects in this movie seemed incredibly out of place, and didn't add anything at all.Lastly, let's talk story. This film was incredibly long and you really felt it, and most of the time there was nothing interesting going on. There were certain story beats that felt off, and honestly we were all left wondering if this film even had a plot. The ending specifically made pretty much no sense. The whole film talks about how the area is being gentrified and that's supposedly the main conflict, small businesses are being pushed out, but then Usnavi decides to give up on his lifelong dream to stay there? If there really is gentrification in the area then I fail to see how he could stay in business. There's also the logical improbability that he could even afford to leave. We're under the impression that he saved up for years to buy his father's old bar and he more than likely would have sold his shop in preparation for this move, but then the supposedly broke Usnavi abandons a booked flight and his dream? The bar was a huge fixer-upper as in it was totally wrecked, so he would have had a terrible time trying to sell it.It's a pretty film, the cinematography is great. If you're a LMM fan then I'd definitely recommend it, just make sure you set expectations to low.",In the Heights

Storylines of different characters are all over the place, and it's not like those trivial side stories and conversations have some sort of profound connotations. They are just...thrown out there and leading to nothing. I think the director may have forgot at some point, that what he was directing is supposed to be a 2hr+ musical film, not a 4 minutes' music video where you could have the characters have epiphanies about solutions to some serious issues of life without showing us how exactly those ""solutions"" could possibly work. If the main storyline is not going to fill up the timespan of the movie, just make the movie shorter! The choreography and some of the music pieces are really stunning, though.",In the Heights

323,scarletdavies-11972,I would definitely recommend!,9,4 July 2021,"ITH is another great musical written by Lin Manuel Miranda- the songs and choreography were incredible, and the whole message of the film is very feel-good and the perfect antidote after months of international lockdown. Despite being originally performed in theatres, I think it translated very well onto the screen. The film was almost 2 and a half hours but felt like 30 minutes because the characters were so charismatic and entertaining.I would have liked to see some more representation in the film- the film starred a lot of lighter-skinned actors, whereas a lot of people were complaining that Washington Heights is primarily made up of dark-skinned black people- but I think Lin Manuel Miranda responded very well to the criticism, promising to educate himself on the matter.Overall, I thought the film was absolutely incredible, and (despite a few innuendos) was suitable for all ages. The message of the film is definitely prominent within society at the moment, and is something that everyone can learn from: appreciate what you have because not everything lasts forever.",In the Heights

326,saoakman-1,Almost everything I wanted it to be,9,12 June 2021,"First off --kudos to the amazing young cast, led by Anthony Ramos. They all brought all the heart that this musical deserves to the screen. And kudos to Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jon Chu, and Quiara Hudes for the choices they made to spotlight the joys and sorrows of this community and to bring Latinx representation to the screen. It was visually stunning and energetic, warm-hearted and upbeat--everything we need for the summer of 2021.The one star I took away was because I love the stage show so much, and maybe my expectations were just too high. Personally, I consider the stage version of ""In the Heights"" to have much more impact both musically and emotionally than ""Hamilton"". When the full opening number was released earlier this week, I was on cloud nine. But I was very sad to see that the movie cut two of my favorite songs from Nina, wrote her mother out entirely, and cut back on her dad's role (also cutting his songs--I don't know, can Jimmy Smits sing?). Some was probably necessary to make the storyline more suitable for film-but I felt it diminished Nina's character a lot. In particular, cutting ""Everything I know"" seemed to soften the impact that Abuela had on the community, and on her especially. (I also personally got thrown by the different treatment of the Lotto storyline, and it took me out of the movie a couple of times because I knew how it went in the play, and kept wondering where it was going.)I did like that the story seemed to center more on Usnavi, whose role on stage had been narrator/tour guide rather than protagonist. And other than the loss of Nina's tribute to her, the portrayal of Abuela Claudia was a lovely bit of film-making. I loved that they gave Cousin Sonny a slightly bigger role, and made more of the relationship between him and Usnavi.Finally-if you go to the theater for this, STAY AFTER THE CREDITS, especially if you're a Lin-Manuel fan.",In the Heights

In the Heights found that subject and excelled. It was hard to feel a connection between a couple of long since dead guys fighting a duel and this musical style. It was very easy to feel a connection between these characters in Washington Heights and their dreams. And the style of the movie greatly enhanced it.

So I was pleasantly surprised to find this new musical showing on my local was actually everything the trailer promised.Yes, 'A quiet place, part II' was brilliantly made, but hardly uplifting, and 'Cruella,' I'm sure would have been much more fun if it hadn't just been the four of us watching it, spread out across the auditorium, so it was good to see a full house - covid regulations allowing - at my local Cineworld for this special screening.New faces - smiling Latino faces - and fresh new latino music makes this a perfect reason to get people back to the cinema again: I can't wait to hear the soundtrack back. The story is simple enough, about following your dream, but there's always a twist, and this one's worth winning the lottery for (and that's the only spoiler you're gonna get)!I can't believe how many people actually sing and dance in this movie! Even if you only paid each extra $500 for making this film, I'm sure the budget must around the $200m mark! Amazing choreography, great acting, and so much fun put into this film, you're sure to want to see it again. Plus, as a bonus you get a free Spanish lesson throughout it all (don't worry, it's all in English otherwise).The only reason I don't give it a 10/10 is because I'm not a big fan of musicals that talk/sing for 2 hours non-stop (think 'Les Miserables' and you'll know what I mean). Thankfully they don't do this throughoutLastly, there are some great original songs in this movie: the title song being one of them, and - excuse my Spanish - ""Carnaval de bairro"" and one called ""96,000"" that takes place in a swimming pool, more a lido type place actually, with a cast of about 10,000 - it's very well done!Go see this on the biggest screen possible with your mates, or go see it alone, whatever you do don't miss this summer's surprise hit!",In the Heights

You notice a lot more ""little details"" too on second viewing -- it's a great work of art on top of being entertaining. I would have liked to know more about the home lives of all the characters, not just some, which isn't a knock -- it shows how invested I was in them. As for the songs, I now love the soundtrack and listen to it all the time, though initially when first watching the movie I thought the songs were just okay as there was too much ""sung dialogue."" The songs are definitely meaningful and some of the ""little details"" I mention are in them like the streetlight metaphor and certain sounds or twists on lines later. Initially I would have preferred they were more distinct from the non-song scenes. But now I can't imagine such a drastic change. I'm going to check out the original Broadway soundtrack next. There's also more of a plot and structure to the movie than some people imply, but I'm wondering what kind of fake drama or fake neat bow people some wanted?

Now Abuela Claudia (played by Olga Merediz) actually owned a Taco Bell on the corner of Washington Heights.

362,idky-64364,Best movie ever,10,6 July 2021,It was not only the best movie of the summer as the promos labeled it but it was the best movie of the year and possibly ever. The choreography was incredibly amazing and it was just overall so good and I know people have most likely complained about some changes but you need to understand that some things will change because it is turned into a movie and unless you're picky you probably won't like it even I sometimes have thought about the changes and am glad some of them were made and wasn't so glad with a few other changes but I had to understand that I couldn't change anything since it was already made and I had to respect the changes like you should too anyways definitely recommend this movie.,In the Heights

They might be talking about the fact that she didn't tell anyone or she didn't cash in the ticket but it honestly helped the movie and if you watch the movie you will know what I mean.,In the Heights

I was already a fan of lin manuel miranda and hamilton and knew this movie was gonna be amazing.I went to the cinema the first time to watch this and instantly loved it as the beat kicked in, in the opening number!! In a few of the more emotional numbers/scenes i cried, as the music, dancing, acting and camera shots were just outstanding. This movie really reminded me how powerful musicals can be.The bright colours and camera shots throughout the whole performance just make you smile and get emotional!!The casting is just spot on and the singing voices are beautiful and fit the characters perfectly.I ended up returning to the cinema 5 times to watch this film and it just kept getting better. I can't believe some of the bad reviews that have been written because i completely disagree with them all.The story is just so heart-warming and lovely. You will cry happy and sad tears while you watch this movie and you will leave the cinema with shivers down your spine. Lin manuel miranda is nothing short of a genius.",In the Heights

366,sundevil86,"Entertaining, but too long and not as good as Broadway",6,22 June 2021,"Gotta start by saying I was SO excited for this and wanted to love it. The first time I saw In the Heights on Broadway I went expecting to hate it (not a fan of rap) but LOVED it instead. But for me, the movie adaptation fell a little flat, so I left the theater disappointed. Honestly, I think it would have been much better without the added dialogue, as 1) it made the movie a bit too long and caused it to drag in spots and 2) some of the actors, who are clearly excellent musical stage actors, just weren't that great during the straight up dialogue parts. I'm not sorry I saw it or spent the money, but it just didn't wow me the way I expected. Loved, loved Lin-Manuel's cameo. That might have been the highlight of the whole movie for me.",In the Heights
367,j_el_guapo,Hamilton Weakquel,4,12 June 2021,"After the first song/dance sequence I couldn't help but feel a Hamilton vibe, which made me feel like Miranda is a one trick pony. Knowing this was written prior Hamilton perhaps Miranda got a chance to fix quirks and perfect things but I also understand why Hamilton made such a stamp in the world of Broadway. This story was hard to follow at times, I also found it could be slow as well. There also seemed to be a lot of underlying messages trying to be pushed through, I guess when you have a society eating it up for the moment you feed them what they are craving. I truly enjoyed Hamilton, I've seen it at different locations all over the country, but I would not pay to go see this. The actors, singers, dancers all did great but the story, songs, theme just failed to capture a truly entertaining musical.",In the Heights

""In the Heights"" is basically a story about Latin-American people in New York, and while the musical numbers and cinematography are nice, Dominican culture, Dominican music, and even Dominican people (most of the people in the movie were Puerto Rican?) are VERY underrepresented. Washington Heights is strongly Dominican, so the fact that so much of Dominican culture was brushed over it simply tone deaf. This movie should've been called ""In Nueva York"" and it would've been a more accurate depiction of what they were trying to represent: the trials, tribulations, dreams, and successes of Latinos in New York.",In the Heights
369,dalestaten614,"Good Movie, Great Story",7,10 July 2021,"The Bad:
It was a little too long most likely because they had a lot of characters that got backstories.I wish the death of Abuela Claudia meant more at the time, build the connection between her and Usnavi, before she died, almost like that was his last link keeping him in the Heights and after her death causes him to want to reconnect with his heritage, but by the end, he realizes the Heights is his home.The Good:
I thought all the songs fit in the movie really well and were entertaining/current.The characters were relatable and came across likable, and it would have been so easy/lazy to make the dad (Jimmy Smits) seem like a bad guy, but they did not do that.This is now in my top 3 of musical movies, yes top 3 because I have only found 3 musical movies I enjoy.",In the Heights
370,gnvt,This is how a movie musical should be made.,9,16 August 2021,"A young woman named Vanessa who aspires to be a professional fashion designer, but currently works in a beauty salon, is singing about wanting to get away by train. She's also seen running down the street. Threads of fabric have recently unspooled off of buildings close by, and she's now chasing after them, as if they represent her dreams. The camera then pulls back, and the viewer realizes that this has all been a daydream.The above sequence is just one of many beautiful and strikingly original ones in the very enjoyable musical ""In the Heights"", which is set in the real New York neighborhood of Washington Heights and was directed by Jon M. Chu. (It was created and written by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Quiara Alegria Hudes.) The sequence is just the right amount of theatrical without being over-the-top, with the fabric alternating between representing Vanessa's sorrow and aspirations. It's memorable, as is another sequence which involves another young woman, named Nina. She's reuniting with her father, whom she hasn't seen in some time because she's been attending college on the west coast. She's just sung a song about being confused about her future and scared about letting all of her childhood neighbors down, but she knows that she must continue on. She bravely walks toward her father, leaving a memory of her as a little girl to skip off in her wake.I could describe other sequences within this movie that are beautiful, but attention should be focused on the attributes that are strikingly original, like the styling heads within a salon that are laughing at one point and depressed at another. (Four of the female characters work at said salon.) After seeing the heads react to the action in front of them, I thought to myself: This is an effect that's truly special because I've never seen it done before. Another memorable moment: when Abuela Claudia, the matriarch of the movie, sings a song about her past on a train and, in a flickering instant, her co-passengers become fellow people of her home country.While the predicaments of the characters are realistic, ""In the Heights"" is a musical and, therefore, can't be held to a total expectation of realism. (After all, the characters break out into song throughout the movie.) This being explained, the musical sequences are staged with a vibrancy that, sadly, is often missing within modern musicals. I'm thinking about the moment when, during the big ""96,000"" musical number, the camera travels under water to show dancing legs and feet. The editing, which is often in tandem with the visuals during the musical numbers, also adds significantly to the vibrancy. Directors of future movie musicals should take note of these factors.Some people have griped that the casting here could've been more reflective of the racial diversity of the real Washington Heights neighborhood. (The neighborhood is predominantly black and Latino.) In response to these feelings, let me once again explain that the movie is a musical and, therefore, shouldn't be entirely judged in connection to reality. Also, the main characters are part of an unconventional family unit that just so happens to be Latino in nature, and perhaps this is personal to Mr. Miranda, Ms. Hudes, or both. In the end, there is some racial diversity that is presented on screen and, it should be noted, diversity that is of the LGBTQ+ variety as well. (A lesbian relationship is presented as commonplace here, so much so that it is simply implied without being made an issue, which is progressive.)
Now for the minor gripes that I have with the movie. I like the fact that, as a lyricist, Miranda incorporates rap into his musicals. This being explained, most of the songs here are rap-based and, therefore, relatively interchangeable. (It's telling that the pretty ballad ""Breathe"", which appears early on in the movie, is consistently referred back to within the film's instrumental music.)
Something else that's problematic is how the Vanessa character is introduced. We see her bare midriff first, and she's clearly objectified. This type of introduction has been done before, especially with women, and it's disappointing in a movie that's otherwise a game-changer. (It's also ironic because, at one point, Vanessa complains about being ogled at by guys and a male director is behind the camera.)
However, with the movie as a whole, the pros outweigh the cons, and there's a lot to like here: the original moments/sequences, the uniformly great cast, the general New York vibe. The musical numbers are so inventively and enjoyably staged, and this makes the movie on par with the best film musicals. A lot of love went into the making of this movie, and it deserves to be remembered at Oscar time.",In the Heights

That is exactly what I would have done if I had not seen everything else already and had nothing to do that day. The dialouge and story are lame and it's attempts to be ""magical"" fall flat. I can tell that instead of making a good movie the film makers relied on a form of manipulative entertainment trying to dupe people into thinking it was something great.

381,bugaboo21,Watch It!!!,8,24 August 2021,"In the Heights is a fun, colorful summer movie musical, with great song and dance numbers and impressively good direction from Jon M. Chu. I've seen the movie twice at this point (first in a theater and then at home), and it definitely grew on me the second time. I tentatively enjoyed it the first time, but it wasn't an ideal viewing experience (long story), and so I took the issues I had with a grain of salt. I'm very glad I did. I didn't really have many issues the second time around and was able to thoroughly enjoy myself. The energy of this movie is electric, and it's hard not to get swept away in many of the musical sequences. ""Paciencia Y Fe"" and ""Carnaval Del Barrio"" were particular standouts to me. In the former, Olga Merediz gives a show-stopping performance as her character reflects on her whole life in the final moments before her death. In ""Carnaval Del Barrio"", Daniela, played excellently by Daphne Rubin-Vega, uplifts her community by starting a loud and energetic party. It's a very fun sequence, and one of the best in the film.One of the reasons the movie as a whole, and these sequences specifically, work so well is because of the great cast. Two members were already mentioned above, but there are many other great performances in the film. Corey Hawkins lights up just about every scene he's in and gives his character an undeniable Broadway energy. Anthony Ramos gives a more casual, laid-back performance, but one which can still carry the movie when it has to, and one which has the confidence to lead a massive song and dance routine if necessary. I would certainly love to see Ramos in more movies, but knowing the way Hollywood is, I'm not holding my breath. Gregory Dias IV is also very fun and charming and can hold his own even when the bigger, more experienced actors threaten to steal his spotlight.Chu also deserves a large amount of credit for how good the film is. His vision makes it feel cinematic and not play-like, avoiding the trap that many play adaptations fall into. He imbues the film with its infectious energy, and his penchant for dazzling visuals shows itself in the finished product.As you can probably tell, I don't have that many criticisms of this movie, so you might be wondering why I only gave it an 8. But while I very much enjoy this movie, I don't think it falls into the ""great movie"" category for me yet. While its themes about the importance of Latin American community and the struggles they face on a daily basis feel pressing, I don't think that the movie explores them in a particularly deep or nuanced way. This isn't to say that it doesn't explore them at all, because it certainly does, and when it does, it does so beautifully, but I'm just not sure it feels often enough or novel enough to warrant a higher score. My mind is certainly willing to be swayed in this area though, and I wouldn't be at all surprised to see the movie sneak up to a 9 the next time I see it (and I'm pretty sure there will be a next time).I also wanted to comment on the movie's length. While it didn't particularly bother me, I've heard other people say that it's too long, and I think that's a valid complaint. You do kind of start to feel its length in the last half hour or so, but like I said I didn't really mind it that much. Also a completely unrelated nitpick, but I thought the singers/speakers were a little too soft compared to the background music in a lot of the songs, so that at certain points it was difficult to understand the lyrics, but I didn't notice it all the time.I also wanted to address the Afro-Latino controversy. I freely admit that as a white person my opinion on this matter should be weighed less than a person of African or Latin American descent, but I still think when thinking about an issue, sometimes the opinion of a person on the outside looking in can be helpful. But again, I want to reiterate that my opinion is being given in utmost humility, and I strongly encourage those looking to better understand the issue to listen to those people being directly affected by it, specifically Latinos themselves. But to dive into my personal thoughts, I feel that each side of the debate can get too extreme. I feel like the side who basically says, ""It's not that big of a deal. They tried their best"" is being inappropriate and is ignoring the colorism that has been present in Hollywood and the world at large for a long time. But I also feel that the other side who mostly complains about this neglect of Afro-Latinos fails to celebrate the representation that is found in the movie and the many people who feel represented by it. My fear is that many Latinos who feel represented and empowered by In the Heights will feel reluctant to share this with others. I think that the conversation being had is an important one, but I don't think that it should make people not watch or enjoy the movie because of its faults. Essentially, I think we need to recognize the problems with the film but not throw the baby out with the bathwater. But again, I want to reiterate that this is the opinion of someone not in any of the communities affected by this issue, so my opinion must be taken with a grain of salt, and I would encourage anyone looking to understand this issue to a greater extent to listen to those in the Afro-Latino or Latin American communities for their, more important and more relevant, thoughts.But to summarize, I think this is a very good movie with great musical sequences, wonderful performances and visionary direction, and I definitely encourage everyone to watch it.",In the Heights

Dumb songs with lyrics like ""Look at the fireworks"" (like that was enough to draw attention from the fact that the plot in the movie lacked any development).

384,colgateplace,Too much Hollywood not enough Barrio,6,31 October 2021,"I had the pleasure of seeing ""In the Heights"" on Broadway with the original cast before it won the Tony Award for Best Musical. I enjoyed the show greatly. The musical, despite being on Broadway, managed to be intimate and conveyed the feeling of the Barrio well. I had hoped to enjoy the movie at least as much, but sadly, I didn't. The movie seemed far too Hollywood. There were far too many people on the screen than would be on the Barrio block. It's also a bad sign when the parts of the movie that have dialogue w/o song or dance are distinctly the best. It's probably because those moments were remnicent of the Broadway Show's intimate connection with the audience. The movie didn't have the same ""flow"" that the Broadway Musical had. The year that In The Heights opened on Broadway another musical, ""Passing Strange"" also opened. I saw that musical as well and enjoyed it. Spike Lee brought that Musical to Film, but chose to just film the musical while it was performed on stage rather than making it a theatrical film. For me, that worked extremely well. Perhaps if ""In the Heights"" had been filmed in the same manner, I might have enjoyed it more. I really wanted to like it, but really didn't.",In the Heights

393,darbymcc,"Too Long, but a Spectacle",6,13 June 2021,"In The Heights is an under-appreciated gem of a Broadway musical, featuring a cast of characters from ethnically diverse Latinx backgrounds (primarily), so the idea to adapt it into a movie was an inspired and long-awaited one. However, what resulted was a product that was either too long, or should have been released in a more episodic format. It was, to its credit, energetic, vibrant, and (mostly) fun.Whether or not you're familiar with the source material, you are sure to be amazed by the magnitude and energy of the dance numbers. The supporting cast and ensemble of this film deserve endless accolades, along with lead actor Anthony Ramos. The choreography is dazzling. But the changes to the script have neutered the romances and left the film without much of a tangible plot line. In effect, the viewer may feel as though s/he is watching a series of extravagant music videos strung together.What's especially disappointing is the vast amount of potential - as though there were a number of competing ideas that all got a little investment but no overarching cohesion was achieved. Visual effects utilized in one scene will never appear again in any kind of similar fashion. Some numbers are conceptual, others grounded in reality. The director's vision (if he had one) is not especially clear. There were issues with pacing, and by the time we reached the second hour I was begging to be allowed to leave the theater. The fun, community-building number ""Carnaval del Barrio"" comes so late that we just want it to be over so the damn film will finally conclude. Which is a real shame, because it's a truly fun song.My biggest gripes with the movie aren't the fault of the cast, though both of the female leads (the characters Nina and Vanessa) were beautiful young women with underwhelming expressionism. Vanessa's strength was her dancing. Nina's was her physical appearance. The vocals of both were (probably unnecessarily) highly edited to the point of distraction.Many lines in the songs were edited to match changes that were presumably meant to make the female characters seem stronger and less reliant on the men. But lines like ""as I feed these birds"" remained, sung by a character who has neither fed birds throughout the course of the movie, nor is she anywhere near doing so at the point of the delivery of the line.Nina's mother's removal from the plot has removed our opportunity to focus on the themes of strength in family ties. Sonny's father's scene is added in and just takes up extra time. It might have made sense to include it if the character was ever referenced again in any capacity, but he is not. Benny and Nina's romance has been reordered in an edit that unfortunately weakens the vibrancy of young love that it represented on stage.Most of the trials and tribulations of the onstage characters don't exist or have far lower stakes on screen. There were a few cheap tear-bait moments crafted to replace the threads of deep empathy that the original production contained.Ultimately, in the same way that music videos will half-heartedly concoct a ""plot"" as an excuse to connect separate numbers together, this film does the same. I've heard that watching it on HBO Max is optimal in comparison to watching it in the theater, because then you have the option to pause it, which you will want to do. I am thrilled that so many Latinx actors have been given this vehicle, and I hope (most) all of them have careers that flourish and prosper after this project.I don't regret watching this, but I am unlikely to do it again. I'm glad my money supported such a diverse cast. I'm mad that it wasn't better.",In the Heights

399,houstonfromtheair,The point is that everyone has an el sueñito,8,27 June 2021,"Some folks gave poor reviews of this film because of the ""lack of focus"" and ""too many storylines"", but that's exactly the point.If you want a classic heroine/hero film to be inspired by and live in that fantasy, go watch something else. In the Heights is about EVERYONE'S ""el sueñito"". Dreams and seeking after them are not exclusive to any one person. The pool scene is a perfect example of this, when everyone reveals what they would do if they won the lottery.The multiple storylines also ties into the collective culture of that neighborhood. The fact that everyone looks out for and knows one another. The neighborhood is your family, your community, your home. You can't name a movie off of a neighborhood like Washington heights and only tell ONE person's story.Enter into this movie with an open mind and don't get hung up on your idea of what a film like this should do or not do.My critique of the film is that the challenges facing the protagonists were pedestrian. Storylines like ""poor Latina woman goes to fancy private school and gets discriminated against"" or ""low income neighborhood with majority of PoC gets gentrified"".",In the Heights

When Nina started talking about the discrimination she faced, all I could think was ""ok here comes the part when Lin Manuel-Miranda turns a few pages in the book of status quo."" Honestly I was a little disappointed they didn't go farther with it.But I gave it 10 anyway because as pure musical entertainment and story telling it is outstanding. I guess I can understand why Manuel-Miranda opted not to make it too heavy so as not to alienate certain segments.

However, there are a couple things I wish they would have included or changed.1. The subtitles were inconsistent. There were subtitles sometimes and no subtitles at other times when it would have been really helpful. As a non-Spanish speaker I really would have appreciated subtitles throughout so I could fully understand and appreciate what was going on through the story.2. The ending didn't provide the closure I longed for. What happened to Sonny? Did he get his green card? What happened to Nina's father now that his business is sold? Did Benny and Nina stay together? What happened to them after she went back to college? Did she do what she hoped to help undocumented youth? Did Benny open his own dispatch business?

It's a very well done movie. My only issues with the movie is that it is too long and it needed way more black latinos in it. There were more afro latinos than what the trailers have shown but there could have still been a lot more. The lack of dark skinned black latinx representation is inexcusable. Washington heights is a mostly afro latino neighborhood. Many of the people there are brown to dark skinned yet most of the cast is lighter than a brown paper bag. If you visit washington heights, there are black dominicans EVERYWHERE. If you base a story in washington heights, there is NO WAY that you don't add more color to this story. The average latino in washington heights IS Afro Latino. It's devastating that there's erasure of black people in a movie about a sector in new york that's predominantly black. This is a prime example of colorism and anti blackness. And it would have been great if most of the main cast were afro latino. It would have made the movie more groundbreaking. I felt that was a missed opportunity. I still think this movie is a step in the right direction because we have never seen a movie with a latinx cast told in this narrative before and i think that's beautiful. But at the same time, there is still lots of work to be done when it comes to representation in the media. We have to do better. But overall, this movie is a lot of fun.",In the Heights

427,ricoraynn,Another overrated musical...,4,14 June 2021,"I was looking forward to this. The musical genre holds a special place in my heart due to it being something I shared with my mother before she inevitably went self destructive with drugs and abuse later life.Anytime a new one is forthcoming, I always get my hopes up due to it reminding me of happier moments from my childhood. Some are incredible and capture that feeling (Greatest Showman, Into the Woods) others leave you realizing how shallow and untalented Hollywood has become (LaLa Land, Cats). This one unfortunately falls into the latter of the two.Besides some very bad pacing elements, the story just doesn't mesh well. There's a lot of extravagance happening on scene but it's cluttered, distracting, and lacks direction and focus. It's the difference between watching a trained dance troupe vs the dance floor at a club on a Friday night.The movie only drags longer due to the runtime. It could have been shortened by 30-40 minutes and nothing would have been lost. Paired with the heavily stereotyped characters portrayed here, it feels almost insulting in some respects.All in all, because this came with my HBO max sub, I'm not overly broken up about it. Just disappointed that it's another hyped musical number failing to live up to the classics of the genre. If you're already subbed to hbo max it might be worth your time if you've already watched everything else that's interested you.",In the Heights
428,guarionex-58270,A disappointment,5,14 June 2021,"The more I think and learn about this movie the less I like it. The only saving grace to this movie was the visuals and the actual singing / dancing. The premise was boring and lazy and it was highly disrespectful to most of the Latinx and Afro Latinx community. I don't even know where to start.This was supposed to take place in Washington Heights, NYC. Dominican capital of NYC. Probably America. Yet, The main character who was supposedly from DR is actually puertorican.... They played ZERO merengue or bachata (staple cultural music of DR). There was more corny rapping than any of it. They couldn't even hire ONE of the many Dominican artists that I'm sure woulda gladly taken a role in the movie. Instead they hired Marc Anthony who didn't even use his voice which woulda been the one redeeming quality of him being in the movie.They had waaaay too many light skin Caribbean actors in the movie. Like there's a perpetual neglect on using darker skin Afro hispanics in Hispanic media and foments colorist and racist opinions in people. What's more they had those same super light skin hispanics talking about being taken on slave ships when we know all good and well it wouldn't have been white hispanics on those ships lol.Ignoring the fact that they didn't even attempt to represent Dominican culture or heritage in the movie, they also ignored every other kind of Latinx/Hispanics that live in Washington Heights. ALL they played was salsa. Yet they mentioned that there were Cubans, Mexicans, and other central and South American countries in that area. Yet it was a Puerto Rico-fest. I love Puerto Ricans and their culture. With that said they are arguably the most dominant Latinx influence in America. I was looking forward to the Dominican Republic receiving a lot of exposure in this film and there was almost nothing. I think it was a missed opportunity to shine some light on the amazing Dominican culture.",In the Heights

441,darwinleahy,generally uninteresting,2,22 June 2021,"Look I'll give it as many points as I can for the overall craftsman-ship and quality of the production but the: theme, music and plot are nothing short of poorly. The main character while a good actor comes across as nothing but self centered, cringey and doesn't really fit a protagonist role. Now understandably it is a musical but the songs drag on for ages as long as 10 minutes per song which is nothing but filler if you ask me. The movie is 2 hours and 23 minutes long but with such a long screentime storywise nothing much is actually achieved. The movie itself sidetracks quite a bit on segments and songs which are unimportant to the story itself, I'm not even sure which genre the movie would be placed under. At certain points in the movie it trys to be heartwarming by bringing up items of past characters while there are other examples of this id rather not spoil the movie. The general plot is honestly hard to follow and can be confusing I feel the movie would be more enjoyable if I was from the Carribbean or something but I can't discredit it for being a bad execution because the production of the movie was actually quite well done I just feel it wasnt a good idea for a movie perhaps a short film or something would've been better suited to the theme of the film but a 143 minute screentime just doesn't feel right.

456,llafeche,well staged but not enough drama to story,7,12 June 2021,"The musical numbers are creative and inventive. The actors are strong across the board and there is not a weak singer among them, which is a pleasure after seeing so many contemporary movie musicals with cast members that do not sing well. Where the movie falls short is that the characters have very little dramatically at stake. Will Usnavi go back to the Dominican Republic? Will Nina return to Stanford? Will Vanessa get a co-signer for her downtown apartment? It's all a bit underwhelming. Even the question whether Sonny will attain DACA status is barely developed. Anthony Ramos and Melissa Barrera have great chemistry but that only makes it harder to understand why the character of Vanessa is so oblivious to their mutual attraction.Finally, an assertion made in the review posted by Gordon-11 needs to be addressed. The user claimed there is a song in the movie ""likening New York subway to slave trade."" This assertion is completely false; there is no such song in the movie, period. There is a scene where Daniela, the salon owner, in dialogue, teases her customers for being reluctant to travel to the salon's new location in the Bronx by saying their people have endured historic hardships like slavery - the least they can do is take a 10-minute trip on the subway. Daniela's dialogue says that a ride on the subway is nothing like the slave trade.",In the Heights
457,electriclemonade,Meh,4,10 July 2021,"Nothing really resonated here for me. Miranda utilizes the same formulaic approach here (3-part harmonies, lots of alliterative verse, and tons of his patented hybrid rap/poetic spit/rap vibe. Truthfully, I wasn't all that keen on Hamilton either, but it was fresh and far more innovative in that it turned etched-in historical images on their head to great effect. I much more enjoyed the Mary Poppins remake than this effort. Not a dud by any stretch, but also not a film that will stand up to the test of time on merit alone.",In the Heights
458,mattscrubs,Latín America is not only The Caribbean,3,13 June 2021,"Why they always define the Latinos with the Caribbean stereotype. Latin America is much bigger than just the Caribbean. I'm from Latín America and this film does not represent me.When I watch a musical I expect to leave the Theatre singing the songs, I can't remember any from ""In The Heights""...Plot?...Great Sound, intresting cinematography, outstanding performance by Olga Merediz.",In the Heights

461,ronwess66,Over hyped!,1,15 June 2021,The first time seeing the preview I was turned off. It seemed pushed on you and if you need celebrities to hype up your movie you lost me. And with Oprah endorsing it it's a total loss for me. A movie should carry itself without anybody endorsing it you just need the plain trailer and that's it. It May be based on a Play but it's not believable. It May lift your spirit but when you walk out those theater doors it's reality your whole neighborhood isn't gonna come do a Choreographed dance with You. What we need is a feel good movie No we don't want a movie pushed on us like we have to like it.,In the Heights
462,haragog,No HIGHlights...,4,25 June 2021,"Latino background is over-rushed in a way that there's nothing subtle and authentic about it, its only american watered down latino culture, like tex-mex, but more like ny-latiny... As for a musical, there's no earworm, no music touches your heart and nests on your ear... They all sound the same. Dancewise it is fine, maybe good, but with the rest being so bad its difficult to appreciate it. As for characters, only abuelita stands out... Which already says a lot...! Latin-disney, but without the quality just the plastic? Perhaps... 2h of my life lost? Definitely...",In the Heights
463,debbie-arvelo,Watch the play,7,13 June 2021,"The play was so much better than the movie and quite honestly I believe it was the casting of Vanessa. The acting was subpar compared with the company of outstanding actors like, Stephanie Baetriz, Jimmu Smits, Patrick Page and Olga. Merediz. Kudos for adding Marc Anthony to the cast. I was hoping that he would sing however.Nevertheless the storyline is fantastic, the music is electric and Lin Manuel is a genius.",In the Heights
464,davidmonard,A side step from the buzz of the original musical,6,24 June 2021,"I've seen the musical twice in London and listened to the album countless times. The first third of the film I was enchanted about seeing it on the screen, bringing back emotional memories of when I saw the show pre-pandemic, then they started to omit and change parts of the narrative which for me ruined the flow and excitement that the original had. I'm not sure if the changes were made by Lin or whether some producers stepped in and wanted to change the story to make it more PC. We lost the excitement of Abuela Claudia winning the lottery, which in the show makes her death all the more tragic. We lost the duet between Nina and Benny at the opening of Act 2! Why?! This was one of the most beautiful songs in the show! There was also a huge chunk of the film that was just dialogue, but the musical is practically all sung/rapped. Why try and fix something that isn't broke?? Also lost a line that was in the show - 'More Ho's than a phone book in Tokyo' - replaced by a line relating to Star Wars?! Shame, was looking forward to this, but left the cinema thinking that it was all a bit too cheesy and edited to be too PC, the musical had edge and cool about it which was unfortunately lost in the movie.",In the Heights
465,aidan-augustin,"High energy, modern, and very fun!",10,19 June 2021,"I loved the modern style of the music and production! Though I appreciate classic Broadway, I hope this is part of an overall trend in musicals.The celebration of life in this little pocket of humanity (Washington Heights) was very uplifting. Great representation of the American melting pot.I saw In the Heights in theaters and it was so fun to see the grand-scale choreography on the big screen. Amazing dance numbers and sets!",In the Heights
466,nikki1998,Beautiful movie!,10,12 June 2021,"Just saw this in theaters and loved it! I am a musical fan, however I have not seen this musical, so I didn't know what to expect. Watching the film and being immersed in it really was a great experience. Many beautiful moments, many silly moments, and many wholesome moments. Lots of analyzing happening in these reviews- just go see it yourself and allow yourself to just follow the story and not think about ""well it coulda been..."" etc. It's an overall great movie. Go check it out!",In the Heights
467,amccolgan1,Doesn't reach its potential,5,24 July 2021,"Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing Hamilton but I just felt that In The Heights fell flat in too many places and seemed to be quite disjointed at times. For me, I would have cut the love interest with Vanessa as I don't think it contributed anything meaningful and she was unlikeable so there was no investment in the relationship with the protagonist, Usnavi. I loved Abeula Claudia and I think her character could have been developed more, especially her relationship with Usnavi and the wider community which would have made her death even more significant. I think having Nina as the protagonist would have made much more sense given her class struggles and the alienation she feels as she attempts to socially mobilise, this would have been complimented more by Abeula's back story and her experiences immigrating to NY. Also, there is far too much excitement and positivity - where or who is the villain? Why would anyone be motivated to leave such a vibrant, close-knit community? There needs to be more focus on the hardships experienced in the projects and the everyday violence/discrimination/poverty that people experience to justify why the main characters want to leave at all. The musical numbers were entertaining but the story was just all over the place, there are about 40mins that could be cut that would make this film much better. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great.",In the Heights

470,erich_antonio,Not as great as is in Broadway,7,25 June 2021,"Trying to not spoil anyone.It's okay they have removed some songs from the original Broadway musical, some of them aren't remarkable. But I don't know why they changed some great things of the plot (that I won mention) and characters like Nina's mom, and then added a new one, a lady from the 'salón' (sorry but she really doesn't contribute to the plot) also this character is the ""spicy latina"" cliché (which is very weird, considering the movie doesn't want the characters to be the Latinos clichés, I think)Trying not to say any more spoilers, in general I think it's a really enjoyable movie, it's great Lin-Manuel Miranda got involved in the production, still Broadway musical is on another level. If you like musicals go and see it, and if you don't, you still can give it a chance (cuz if you don't you'll be questioning ""What'd I Miss"")",In the Heights

The plot and characters were relatable and touching without being too heavy. The songs and actors are great too; basically, it's LMM-genius without the sadness of Hamilton. Also, I'm not usually into soundtracks, but I've had this one on repeat since seeing the movie. Such joy :)",In the Heights

It does suffer the curse of the sequel; the awesome novelty of seeing and hearing Hamilton did diminish the awesomeness of the show's score.

I thought there was a story about a young man who wanted to go home to renovate his parents old place but didn't want to leave the girl he loved or the life he could build here in New York.There was a few story lines but damn we should have the ability to figure out more than one story at a time in this day an age.The only thing I missed was the mom and her songs.,In the Heights

Everyone I know who's seen this is shocked at how good the reviews are, wondering if Disney has something to do with this. I adore LMM but sadly this is not his most solid work. I loved the music but the lyrics were cheesy at times and generally meh imo. Story was long and didn't really have anything that kept my attention. It basically chronicles the struggles of immigrants without introducing any REAL conflict. I wouldn't recommend it. If you REALLY wanted to see it just listen to the soundtrack it's better than watching the whole movie.",In the Heights
486,pedroduquescp,Heartwarming,10,18 June 2021,"A musical about the importance of having a community. Somewhere that always feels like home. A nice and simple story, told with the most amazing songs and visuals. The pace of the movie feels just right and moves in accordance to the importance of each scene. Actors are great and clearly cast based on talent and not the fact that they're famous......(yes James Corden I'm talking about you).But you're sure to have a good time if you like vibrant musicals. Just please don't be waiting to see a movie where at least one hour and a half is dedicated to singing and then expect for it to be one hour and a half.......people talk in this movie.",In the Heights
487,lloydfacey,"Brilliant Music, lacks story.",7,21 June 2021,Perhaps the brilliant music throughout the show distracted my brain from the story. I will need to watch this again to verify but it lacked the deep story narrative that you would expect from a major cinema release.,In the Heights
