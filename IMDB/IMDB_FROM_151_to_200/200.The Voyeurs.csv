0,grantss,Listless and absurd,3,13 September 2021,"A young couple, Pippa and Thomas, discover that their neighbours are not at all privacy-conscious, allowing them to see all that happens in their apartment. They start spying on them, initially simply out of voyeurism. However, Pippa then starts meddling in the neighbours' lives, with dire consequences.A film that is billed as a steamy thriller but for the most part it is pretty listless and tame, meandering aimlessly about. This results in the film taking about 20-30 minutes longer than it should.When it finally does find a direction it is absurd and implausible. It seems so tangential and ridiculous that It feels like the writer generated it randomly.Not much to recommend (though I didn't mind Sydney Sweeney...).So much for ""if you can't make a good movie, make a short movie"".",The Voyeurs
1,neil-476,Not a disaster,6,17 October 2021,"A young couple move into an apartment, and the girl becomes obsessive about the sexual behaviour of the couple in the apartment across the way. No-one in this film has curtains or blinds.I was expecting this movie to be a typical skinflick (and it does have a steamy scene featuring the pneumatic Ms Sweeney: this girl has a great future in front of her, and when I say ""great future"", that's not what I mean at all, know what I mean?).But, in fact, there is a tolerable plot, some interesting ethical issues, a couple of decent twists, some lovely photography and well-crafted sound design, so there is worthwhile stuff to watch.Unfortunately, the male protagonist is annoying and the first half the film is very slow, so there's that, too. That brought it down from 7 to 6 stars for me.",The Voyeurs
2,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Refreshingly explicit thriller, ruined by its own indulgence",7,23 September 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningPippa (Sydney Sweeney) and Thomas (Justice Smith) are a young couple who live in an apartment in New York City. From the view of their window, they are able to stare across the street into the apartment of fellow young couple Seb (Ben Hardy) and Julia (Natasha Bordizzo) and the open eroticism they enjoy with each other. After a while, what they are able to see crosses boundaries, and when Pippa strikes a friendship with Julia through her work as an optician, it sets in motion a devastating chain of events with deadly consequences.We live in a time where privacy has become largely redundant. If we don't have apps spying on us through our phones, tracking our movements and relaying it to God knows who, or companies selling our data to whoever we inadvertently allow them, to reality TV shows where we spy in on the private affairs of people we don't know for entertainment they're in on, the age where everything felt secure feels long gone. And so, there is at least a refreshing honesty in what they both know they're doing to the central protagonists of director Michael Mohen's dark erotic thriller, an at least pleasingly adult and unrestrained piece with a deeper undertone.Disasterously, it fails initially right at the beginning, introducing us to two undercooked, rather unengaging lead characters, who fail to really draw us in until they start their unethical business. This will write it off for some, but for those who stick around, it does develop in to a more dark and compelling piece, with lead star Sweeney displaying a skittish vulnerability as the girl with a dark secret, while part time East Ender Hardy has a strong presence as the domineering third party player, building up to a shocking conclusion with a dark twist, which gives it the feel of an old Tales of the Unexpected episode, but for some reason it decides to prattle on for another twenty or so minutes, completely ruining what could have been a great ending with a ridiculous turn of events.If it had had the good sense to end when it should have, it could have worked as a dark morality tale, but spoilt by its own indulgence, it leaves a nonsensical lasting impression, despite everything it got right, not least a drowned out new version of Billy Idol's 1983 classic Eyes Without a Face playing over the beginning and end credits. ***",The Voyeurs
3,ops-52535,its a fable...,8,11 September 2021,"About happiness, grief, exploitation, revenge, avenge, photographic arts, sex, romance and fantasy, and as if it werent enough death leaves them blind, forever.Its a fantastic erotic drama thriller about voyerism within the glassy environment of the urban interface, and if youre not tantalized to drop a glance into your neighbours realms after watching this movie then youre a robot.Story and plot has resemblances to many films made over the past 50 years, and has the impertinent sexual glow that only a few might lit into a fire. The 50 shades of... series lingers in my mind,but i think this film will give the audience a better and more rewarding experience, and may in the end have extinguished the hormone rush of sexuality.I will put this on for my wife to see... alone...cause you never know the fallout of physical excercise a grumpy old man will have to endure afterwards. So take a deep dive into some of the finest filmographical fables made in the last decade. A recommend.",The Voyeurs
4,subxerogravity,"Overall, I'm going to lean towards liking this flick",6,11 September 2021,"I'm a little indifferent about this film.I watch the movie because Sydney Sweeney and Justice Smith were in it. Two actors that I come to enjoy and they were really good in it together.The story was really good too. If the bottom-line plot is that vengeance is an artform, then this movie has an ending that's almost a masterpiece.However, the story could have been handled better. The movie was a little too over reaching with the trivia (like the fact that one of the Voyeurs is an eye doctor). Things I feel that should have come off as subtle seem to be slapping me in the face whenever I turn around.The actors were pretty good at keeping us in the moment but not good enough for me not to see what was coming next in this predicable erotic thriller.As an erotic thriller however its top notch and it had its melodramatic moments that hit in a cool way.",The Voyeurs
5,jtindahouse,A hidden gem,9,16 September 2021,"Early on in 'The Voyeurs' I thought we were in for the typical 'Rare Window' storyline we have seen dozens of times before. How wrong I was. This film is very different to that, and has so much more going on. This is one of those rare hidden gems where you see an IMDb rating of only 5.8/10 and could easily discard it, but if you do give it a chance you are so glad you did. I had a great time with this movie.The movie is hyper-sexual. Early on it implies that it is going to be quite modest, but this is very much misleading, and from there the film becomes very erotic for almost the duration. It feels very much like 'Basic Instinct' where there is a genuinely interesting story taking place and the eroticism is just a part of the ingredients.The film is a little longer than average for this type of movie, falling just short of two hours. I found myself so interested and invested in the story that the extra time didn't bother me at all, and instead allowed the movie to move at a more natural pace.The final act of this movie is bonkers. It throws everything it has at the kitchen wall, and most of it sticks. The twists and turns are authentically shocking and really caught me off guard. I can't recommend this film highly enough. Please see it. 9/10.",The Voyeurs
6,jadavix,Silly tawdry erotic thriller with aspirations at social commentary it never reaches,6,13 October 2021,"Not only is ""The Voyeurs"" the kind of movie Steven Soderbergh makes, I also wish that he had made it. Michael Haneke, too. These auteurs would have found a style befitting of the material that would have made it seem plausible, that would have kept us engrossed, and that, hopefully, would not have required the ridiculous, jarring twists and turns that the movie ends on.The young couple move into an apartment in Montreal with windows that look directly into an apartment across the street. The very first time they look, they watch the couple in that apartment have sex. They continue to watch, get turned on, and even go so far as planting a listening device.The climactic twist isn't entirely predictable. I wasn't surprised. But still, Soderbergh or Haneke could have put more of a point on it. Here it was a bit ""meh"", as my generation likes to say.I really think that the twists and turns that come after were put in as an afterthought when the director realised nobody was going to buy what he had sold up to that point. It almost feels like a consolation prize, as though he's saying, ""I agree that sucked because I don't have the skill to do it the way Haneke would have... oh well, here's some extra tawdry garbage.""He should have just made an erotic thriller. This is more like ""Sliver"" than ""Benny's Video"" or even ""The Girlfriend Experience"". And an erotic thriller would have been more fun. The attempts at seriousness or social commentary come to nothing, and in the final act, are totally abandoned.",The Voyeurs

Well done!",6,23 October 2021,"This film start with a bunch of people walking at the street, and a woman closing the curtain in the fitting room scene! As turnout, this film is about a voyeur ""Pippa"" need to take revenge on her neighbors(Seb, and Julia) who causing the death of her boyfriend(Thomas)! Entire film full of adult fantasy scene!

8,andrewchristianjr,PRETTY DECENT.,6,29 October 2021,"For much of the 2 hours this retro ""erotic"" thriller moves at a snails pace, then everything speeds up for the denouement, at which stage the plot becomes absurd. It has a few good moments, but overall lacks genuine tension, a plausible plot and the viewer is left with a ""so what"" feeling.",The Voyeurs
9,caspian1978,Got You To Look !,7,10 September 2021,"Don't lie to yourself. 95% of the people who want to watch this are here to see Sydney Sweeney's assets and nothing else. For those fans, you got what you paid for. Her eye candy alone makes this movie deserving of an audience. Now, for those who decided to watch this movie from start to end without fast forwarding to just the scenes with Sydney Sweeney showcasing her goods, you will be happy to find a movie with an actual plot. For all you Haters with high expectations, I want to remind you all that this movie is not Gone with the Wind. Therefore, those with low expectations will be blown away at this movie's high production value, decent acting, and interesting plot with a good ending. Those who hate this movie need to get their eyes checked for multiple reasons. The Voyeurs is exactly what it sets out to be. If you are looking for anything else, you came to the wrong movie. Worth the watch and even a few rewinds.",The Voyeurs
10,rgkarim,"Should You Stalk This Film, Like The Characters Stalk Their Goals?",7,11 September 2021,"LIKES:Acting:
The key concept of this film is the acting and the group of players in this drama are certainly worthy of the Victorian era of acting. Sweeney's drole is a high intensity, moral challenging, spectacle that is a constant rise and fall of emotion. It's contained, it's realistic and she executes her roles so well, even in the more ""adventurous"" bouts of love making that arise. A nod to her acceptance to put herself in this type of role, Sydney is indeed the central pillar of the movie. Smith does well in his roles, a sort of wavering compass that challenges the excitement of the situation and tries to navigate the moral ambiguity of the modern world. He's got some fun delivery of lines, has some great execution of emotion, and certainly plays the part of the supporting actor well. Hardy and Natasha Liu Bordizzo are also fantastic supporting roles in this movie, as the very party they are viewing in much of this madness. Hardy has that air of creepiness and artistic nature this movie flourishes on, while Bordizzo nails the intriguing, seductive wife who holds much potential in this display. The fearsome foursome will each play a big part in Sydney's performance and the chemistry is quite strong in my opinion.Artistic:
Praise to the muses who motivate the new approaches to cinema making and storytelling. The Voyeurs accomplishes the artistic goal and takes concepts we take for granted, molding them into a new piece that is indeed intriguing to watch. The movie's various acts each have a certain style to the mix, taking on a change in attitude that feels very much like a fleshed out play. It's got heat, it's got style, and it does it's best to sort of reflect on the moral decisions brought up in this movie.Some Comedy:
It's not my favorite style, but some of the comedy was perfect for a dark and drier atmosphere that this cinema showing focused on. Don't expect slapstick and super clever lines that will be on T-shirts, because it's very little. No, this is the type where irony, quirks, and how our vices are humorous in how dark and self-centered they can be. This dark comedy is meant for a different brand of goer.Assessment of Ethics:
The movie is a giant reflection on the modern trends of today's world, at least some of the darker aspects that seem to be the normal. Ethical discussions sort of take place in the banter, but it is the visual style that examines the facets of watching and butting into people's lives. As the obsession grows, the consequences that arise start to really hit home, and the debate to determine the next course to drive the story and hopefully have you reflect too.The Ending:
Though not quite as shocking as they were probably going for, I must admit the Voyeurs' ending is really a crowning achievement of climactic finale. The culmination of all the ideas, the exploitation of things you have not noticed, and some of the thoughts the plot may stimulate are well wrapped up as the revelations emerge. I loved the wrap up, the piecing of information together and really bringing the emotional tension to a major height with a very satisfying conclusion. Though there is a stretch of the imagination and it feels a little out of sync with the other parts of the film, but overall it is the cherry on top of the intense sundae.DISLIKES:The Pace: I agree with my fellow reviewers that the pace is pretty bad for much of the ovie. The Voyeurs is a realistic portrayal of life with an artistic lens, and much like real life, this particular focus is a bit boring. The realistic conversations, meeting at cafes and the intro does little to stimulate things and without the fun dialogue and entertainment aspects... it's not the most fun opening. Once the drama starts, you got to be a fan of the dark comedy or the vices that soap operas and modern medical dramas thrive on, or else you will be bored with what they present given not much really moves.The Plot Holes/Logic Gaps:
For a movie all about the sinful vices, these moments are going to be excusable, and fans of the genre will also forgive the lack of logic that this movie seems to take pleasure in diving into. The fact that one couple seems to notice, but the others do not is just one of the arguments that someone can throw, alongside several other factors that are a bit of stretch to ignore for those who look for logical layouts. These moments sort of stack upon one another, and depending on if you can get lost in the artistic nature of the film will determine your tolerance. Some other things include the ignorance of certain characters, the reactions when certain information is shared is a bit lacking, and some of how they handle the situations are just a few examples of the logical gap. Fortunately, this movie does handle this in a better way, but I won't say anything else to reduce the risks of spoilers.The Character involvement:
As I said, the cast of four have great chemistry, and sadly I would have liked a little more integration and involvement of each other in the lives based on the way the crumbs were being laid. The movie starts trying to lead us down directions that suggest some of these deeper meanings and relationships, but they kind of fizzle out for the focus on the sexier aspects of the movie. Given how long that it took to get to the ""meat"" of the movie, and even longer to get to the sizzling ending I liked, more integration amidst these four could have been engaging. The secondary and tertiary characters are also much of a waste and given we had to take tangents to involve other facets of life, were really not needed in my opinion.The Porn:
Your tolerance for sexual scenes is going to vary, and I'll admit this part of the film serves multiple aspects on the sake of the story. However, it does not mean I want to see it in the nature, manner, and details that they did. The Voyeurs holds little back in hiding the act of intercourse, and some of the endeavors that go with it. While nothing too bestial or alternative role play, it's still not fun for viewers like me to see the awkward nature of watching and acting at the same time. In fact it's a bit gross and awkward, and the fact we see it happen multiple times certainly earns the R rating of the film. This kind of stuff adds little in terms of what I enjoy, so it gets a dislike in just the excess that they chose to bring with it.The VERDICT:
The Voyeurs is a movie that is a bit more original, has some spice to it, and is truly an artistic visualization addressing key concepts the world needs to revisit. Bringing shock factor is certainly key to help one readers habits that they may share, and the drama is certainly top notch to rival a modern day drama on say ABC, but with much better acting and control compared to the writing of the tired shows. However, it's very strength of artistry may also be its biggest flaw as well, and the fact that it robs some of the entertainment value that I like in my dramas. The pace is not my speed and takes a while to really get into the intriguing ""suspense, focusing on real life relationships that offer little in terms of content. The plot gaps are heavy, and more so the suspense of logic that some story hunters are going to pick apart with ease. Though it handles this well, it requires sticking to the end to see it come together, something that may be difficult given the amount of erotic focus this film does. If that's your cup of tea, hit it up immediately, but if you want more sustenance and a little more engagement, veer away from this film instead.My scores are:
Drama/Mystery/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5.",The Voyeurs

12,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Another good Rear Window adaptation.,7,12 September 2021,"This is the second adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) I've seen this year (2021). Except this one has an erotic theme to it that makes it fun to watch. It isn't quite Hitchcock good, but it isn't trash either. Sydney Sweeney plays Pippa, an innocent looking girl next door type with a great body and beautiful boobs. She's like a guy's dream come true because she's gorgeous and she is freakier than you are.She's like that dream come true except things turn soar when she butts her nose into the neighbor's marriage and complicate her dude's life. Yeah, so much for that idealized girl fantasy. Nosey b- will be Nosey. It's never a good idea to stick your nose into someone's else's marriage. That can be a fatal mistake in many circumstances. No moral high ground to gain from it.The film has an interesting twist that I won't give out. I thought the film was good right up to the point when Julia waves back at Pippa from her window. Had the film ended there, it would have been a good psychological horror/thriller film. I was planning to give this film an 8/10. But the producers and writers just went to far and added a stupid revenge twist that I felt undermined the rest of the film. Screenwriters, please learn when its time to put away the pen and paper.Again, its not Hitchcock quality and there were some other dumb stuff even before Julia and Seb look back at Pippa, but they weren't fatal mistakes. How on earth would Julia and Seb know Pippa would network search her printer for the twist? (I am being purposely vague here) I was fine with that bad choice in writing. But making Pippa a hero at the end undermines the bad decisions Pippa did that destroyed her relationship with Thomas, the beta male and possibly destroyed another woman in the process. Imagine if Julia really did do what we all thought she done?Making Pippa a hero or anti-hero is like shooting yourself in the foot. I guess some white girls do go back after having black lol.Anyway, I probably will rewatch this film for reasons that will be obvious to lots of guys 🍆 Thank you Sydney Sweeney, you made up for Amazon's disastrous Cinderella remake last week. I am still working on forgetting James Corden role in that terrible fairytale adulteration.P. S. Amazon, please release the unedited NC-17 version of this film. I promise I will renew my Prime subscription if you release an uncut version!",The Voyeurs

14,Draysan-Jennings,Soft porn meets Rear Window,6,12 September 2021,"I almost turned it off 15 minutes in. I couldn't take the main couple serious. The chemistry was off and his voice made me cringe. I somehow stuck with it and kept watching. Nothing really significant happens for the better part of the film. It kinda reminded me of a soft porn version of Rear Window. There was a predictable twist towards the end, but the best part of the movie was the last 5 minutes. That final scene was great. It definitely saved the movie.

""The Voyeurs' makes its intentions clear from the get-go, as a perky young couple move into a new apartment and begin spying upon the amorous antics of neighbors across the street. So far, so good - but the script never bothers to invest Pippa and Thomas with any personality - and neither does it do so for any other character. After some episodes of bland soft-core erotica, annoying traits in the acting and directing departments herald an approaching disaster.Complications are added to the stew, but fail to give it any flavor, and everything starts falling apart as unlikely events are piled onto coincidences and absurd plot twists. Long before the end, credibility has been utterly lost as the story becomes a melodramatic farce with gigantic plot-holes, floundering about in cinematic limbo.",The Voyeurs

27,isaacochoterena,No impact,4,22 September 2021,"With an interesting but predictable premise, the film fails on the impact of the plot twist.Although in the end many things make sense, it fails to impact the plot twist in the story, which is predictable, other things that do not work are some performances that feel very false, the plot is not well defined, which returns to the tedious and aimless movie. Of the things to highlight are the production design, photography and how the psychology is raised in the characters, although they do not explain why the characters act that way.

Very slow and boring story, only kept going by the sexual element intertwined within it.I'm sure wireless printers have to be on the same WiFi network, so how she can see every single printer in the neighbourhood is beyond me...plus, who leaves their printer on at that time of night when it's not in use? I guess it's just another movie where you have to suspend your disbelief in able to get through it.Overall, it's nothing special.

His partner is really cute and has a great body but he's not very interested in having sex with her. So why are they together?Having watched the whole thing, my recommendation is to not think too much about it or you'll start to question some of the plot details.

We will in a moral bubble which we implicitly impose upon people around us. The second act becomes a table turner, flips the narrative which was well executed. Some might call it unbelievable but that just means you're looking at it from your glasses. Someone with my experience would know it can happen.But when the third act comes, the beginning sets a bar very high then it crashes under its own weight.I expected this movie to be an average flick and I put it on to sleep but it kept me hooked up till 8am and made me write a review.

I didn't mind the twists even though I thought there were some loose ends. It's dark, there's a bunch of erotic stuff going on. The film questions what's moral and what's not.That said, there are a lot of plot holes and issues with logic but, for some reason, I don't think they bother me as much as I thought they would. But I am unable to LIKE the movie either. At the end of it all, I told myself that it's just another meh movie but I can't seem to convince myself to say that either because of the ending.So, as of now, I can't decide if it's trash or decent or actually good.

35,Maelific71,Had A Great Fall,4,12 September 2021,"First thing I want to mention is that I really liked Sydney Sweeney (Pippa) in Nocturne. Frankly, it's why I selected this movie to watch. The problem I had straight away here is that she looks barely 18 with her clothes on. When they're off she looks like one with implants. As an example, when she was robed at the spa next to Bordizzo (Julia), it looks like there's a 10 year age difference. Also, remember the bar scene where she's there intending to pick up Julia's husband Seb (Hardy)? In real life she's carded like three times. Smith (Thomas) on the other hand fit his role perfectly and especially nailed it in the scene where he got the hell out of Dodge. However, what was up with his voice? It certainly didn't sound normal.Anyway, the movie was cruising along acceptably until they decided to resurrect Julia. After that it went downhill fast. For me, it entirely blew up the movie where I honestly couldn't even give it an average rating at its conclusion.",The Voyeurs

Which is why I'm confused with all the twists at the end, because the movie was interesting enough without them.It's just very fictional, like a watt pad novel my friends used to love reading in high school. As a whole, feels like it was stuck in-between two minds, whether to make it an erotica or not. The illogical twists and the stand out sex scene made it feel like they were trying, but there wasn't enough of it to consider it a ""skin flick""(lack of better words). I almost like it as a regular movie, too mediocre to make it a priority on your watch list yeah but still worth a watch.

Especially if they were as hot as this guy in the movie. The 2 main couples are kind of nerdy and boring and get to experience neighbors, that are artists, eccentric and gorgeous. I mean I could relate to pippa on that, especially since her boyfriend wasn't the charming masculine type. Some neighbors do get way too involved and spy on each other. Like I said the whole movie, even the sexual parts were amazing. It kept me entertained and I didn't want too miss a part. But the ending pissed me off, yes it's a twist. But it's a stupid twist. Like how did Pippa carry them out, after she destroyed their eyes? You can't just leave 2 people blind, in your place of work. Also what if the boyfriend didn't decide to come home at that exact time and see Pippa with the hot artist? What if he never came back? Or came back the next day? The fact he just strolls in, the night Pippa finally sleeps with her obsession and he takes a sip of that green water. What if he didn't drink that water? Like I said it would have been a really great movie, except with that ending. Then it turns into he was poison? Ok but what if their plan didn't work out like that? That's the part that makes me nuts. Yes I loved how they were watching them the whole time, because I had a feeling. But it went too far! I still think it was a great watch and I will probably watch it again. I loved the obsession and temptation Pippa showed. I really wanted her and the hot artist to end up together.",The Voyeurs

It also had a good soundtrack.Also, I like the 'Eye' theme throughout. From the sublime opening credits, song choices, Pippa's job, to the scene when Pippa and Seb first meet we get a very artsy shot of just her eye, then his. It was all very well done.There were a few things that occurred that I didn't see coming and I was very curious to see how it would play out.

Lots of 10 star ratings saying it's brilliant. It's not.It's a unique movie and you probably won't see the ending coming. The problem is, the ending is too clever for it's own good. We all love a good twist but this movie stacks about 4 twists on top of each other, each less believable than the one before it. In terms of the acting, it's pretty solid other than the main character's boyfriend. He sounded like he was reading lines in a script in the most monotone voice possible. Last thing, the movie is about 30 minutes too long. I could see that being annoying to viewers.Bottom line: It's a mixed bag. Plenty to like. Plenty to dislike. More than plenty to roll your eyes at.

Don't tell me that both buildings run off the same network with no password... this isn't the 90's.Anyways, for the most part, the writing was terrible.

Without her it would have been a rather dull film. Obviously the filmmaker loves Rear Window and Body Double but i agree with most that sometimes too many twists at the end can have less impact than a simple clean ending especially if you have to explain it quickly and cheapened the entire story line. A shame as it could have been a deeper more complex 3rd act if written in a different manner instead of just going for shock value and rushing it at the end.Looking forward to more films from.

However, Michael Mohan subverts the expectations and delivers a worse version of what could've been.From the start of the movie until the 'twists' the movie is predictable and tension is lacking. Viewer never have time to ask themselves 'what will happen?' or 'what our protagonist will do in this situation?'. We have all the answers and sadly so do our protagonist. That is a big problem in itself in a movie where the main goal is to make thriller movie.As for the twists; if they cut out the last 20 minutes of the movie, it is still a bad movie but at least not a trainwreck that it is right now. Twists try to compensate for the lack of tension and tries to grab the attention of the viewer who are already checking their phones, waiting for the movie to end.

Both the dialogue and dialogue delivery makes you cringe. Especially the black guy. His voice just felt unpleasant. The story is titillating so I kept going.It all gets better down the line.The acting - by both the main lead - becomes watchable. Dialogues wouldn't make you cringe anymore neither will the delivery. Everyone acts decent. The story picks up the pace.The plot isn't nonsensical, their way of eavesdropping is actually possible but I'm not so sure about the bluetooth thing that happens afterwards.Then their is the scene where Sydney Sweeney - after teasing right from the very beginning - bares it all and oh boy you wouldn't be disappointed. They don't cut it short it keeps going for ample amount of time.I watched this movie only because she was in it.It all gets twisted in the third act. It reminded me of ""The Perfection"" which is even more twisted than this movie.Anyway, it gets ahold of your attention and doesn't let go. The ending might be too much for some but it was fine by me and I had a good time watching this flick.If nothing else then watch it for Sydney Sweeney. That girl is gorgeous.",The Voyeurs

Of course the attempts to modernize the movie by adding technology and soft core porn do not help the plot.The movie also tries to make a statement about privacy that wanes in comparison to the many epic fails in the screenplay and the acting.The attempt to create a surprise ending is SO FAR FETCHED is what really tanked this movie from being a solid 6 to 4 star rating for me.",The Voyeurs

Who the F drinks random wine left at your door step after that or at all? Why would you chase her to her clinic? Stupid beyond belief. These 2 events going as planned in tandem is completely improbable. Yeah they killed Thomas (With this kinda voice this guy shouldn't act) with another touch and go plan. Even if he's got the habit of drinking whatever green crap is in that bottle doesn't mean he would in the mood he was or that night. Also where's toxicology report? That would clearly say that guy didn't hang himself. Instead Pippa made them blind in response for all of it but she screwed up everything herself for the most part.

It's so naive and so simplistic in its naivety, it just had to be. Well, here I stand corrected and that somehow doesn't compute, unless writer/director sees himself as the photographer, which will be utterly ridiculous in its own right.This is a shallow one, all right? A badly performed shallow one. An unrealistic one, if you will. Considering the movie is developing in Canada, that is, where police would have intervened on multiple occasions and ended this farce right after the first few minutes.There was this predictable development, then there was a much expected plot twist, that was utterly ridiculous and then there was a much unexpected plot twist of the plot twist, that was even more ridiculous.A perfect example of the new era, in which streaming platforms would put just about anything online, because they desperately need new content created 24/7.",The Voyeurs

From the start to the end absolute nonsense.This couple literally just moved together, fresh love and it takes her only a couple nights to cheat on her husband without even trying to change their sex life. She was more obsessed with the neighbor she knew for a day than her own boyfriend.Towards the end nothing made sense anymore. She made them blind, for some reason they both just didn't do anything and kept living in their apartment blind together.And what is the moral of the movie? The main character has absolutely no consequences for any of her actions. Any consequences where somehow bypassed.Without a doubt must be the worst professional production movie of the decade even worse than Karen. That alone deserves an Oscar.",The Voyeurs

Close up shots of the pupil were awesome.The movie sums up in one line that Jacob always asks pippa ""am I not enough for you?And the script unknowingly hints at pippas obsession for a better suitor. So we know the scene is coming.It's funny when she says you manipulated me. She already wanted him when looking from the binoculars so that was dumb.The adultery was just for entertainment and helping the plot. No mention of why Julia would allow her husband to bang everyone he meets.It's a thriller no doubt but senseless. Like why would pippa try to meet seb in the end.Why would Jacob leave abdrupt? Without knowing what happened to Julia.Would life be different if they lived elsewhere??No because Jacob was never enough for pippa.

Then wife shows up at the place of her employment um wants to befrriend her??? How convenient...) But then again. Its a movie.

Tons of nudity and explicit sex so make sure the audience at home is appropriate.Also I admit it got me thinking. I don't think Seb was involved in the whole drug thing. I think Julia did that on her own and it was actually intended for Pippa, but Julia worked with what she got. That's why you can tell at the end Seb feels so bad about things. If you look closely, he looks at Julia in dismay when Pippa says Thomas was poisoned.This is just a theory, my point is, I think it's not meant to be as straightforward as some say.

We've all been guilty of spying on neighbours, and seeing this couple go down a rabbit hole really drew me in as I could understand the way in which they justified their actions.

166,raygaitherjr,That voice... what the...,6,23 September 2021,This is my third attempt at watching this and it tough. The main actors voice is unbearable for me... I have never ever been bothered by a voice to the point of turning off a show but its happened twice this this one and not sure i can get past it. I tuned in mainly because of Sydney but don't know if it is worth the voice torture.,The Voyeurs
167,shoxy-51911,Worst film of 2021,1,10 September 2021,This film was began filming in October 2019 and was completed in December 2019. The director Michael Mohan then cunningly delayed it for nearly two years.. the end result? A tedious movie with weak scriptwriting a poor plot and embarrassing dialogues. Michael Mohan please do us all a favour and refrain from directing movies in the future. Luckily I was able to write to amazon prime who kindly refunded me my purchase fee after I explained what a awful film this is.,The Voyeurs

170,rocketbran,UPDATE!,8,25 September 2021,UPDATE FROM MY PREVIOUS REVIEW. THIS WAS TRASH AND I LOVED IT. Still can't stand justice's attempt at a deep voice but this was OTT and reminded me of lifetime garbage i loved as a kid.,The Voyeurs
171,karthikkohli,One time watchable,1,10 September 2021,The story clearly explains u main theme ..but lacks at ending and some un necessary plots which destroyed the story...but Sydney Sweeney performance was tooo good .she carried away with great acting skills.,The Voyeurs

177,antonph-24500,Literally What.,4,12 September 2021,"Other reviews might say that this movie gets better in the second half, but as the film continued I found myself becoming increasingly hateful towards Pippa.In the latter half of the movie Pippa's life comes crashing down (Thomas's supposed suicide, Julia's supposed death) and her friend tries to justify the entire thing, and the worst part SHE BELIEVES IT REALLY WAS NOT HER FAULT.It may seem I am just complaining about the story choices but the entire message it produces is far from good. ""It's not your own fault, it's the other person's fault. So blind them.""The story makes no sense.",The Voyeurs
178,qcrwdpsxs,Painful wait for a disappointing finish,2,13 September 2021,"Writing a modern day rear window apparently wasn't the slam dunk they thought it was. This movie is painfully slow and although the end of the movie saves it from being a total disaster, it's extremely difficult to sit through until the end. This movie was just like the characters within it. There just isn't much to like about it.",The Voyeurs
179,JNB37,The type of movie that makes you want your life back.,2,14 September 2021,"Bad, bad and more bad. I suspected this movie would be average at best, but it was somehow worse. Poor scripting and mediocre acting are just a couple of many issues with this movie. Justice smith who was good in the Get Down on Netflix seemed to have forgotten how to act, and had some weird accent/voice and on top of that, he was poorly casted to play Sydney Sweeneys love interest, their kissing scenes were disconnected, unbelievable and slightly cringeworthy. The movie had a great concept( though not original) but fell flat, was entirely to long and the ending was quite silly. I do not recommend.",The Voyeurs

183,tomwar-3,One overriding reason to watch this film,4,18 September 2021,"The film's main draw is Sydney Sweeney and her amazing breasts. It is also wonderfully shot but the plot, characters' motivations and behavior, are all risible. No amount of good acting (and there is none) could have drawn us into this utterly unconvincing drama.",The Voyeurs
184,evequeen-20597,Worst movie I have wasted my time on in 2021,1,23 September 2021,Would rate 0 star if I could. The current score is way too high already probably just bcs of the nude scenes. But the story is so baaaaaaddd and ridiculous that even the nude scenes can't turn me on. This movie s moral makes me soooooo angry!!! Don't waste your time on it!!!,The Voyeurs
185,jamesjlabrosse,Hard to finish,3,24 September 2021,"The movie is set in Montreal, yet all the French speakers in the movie speak with a euro-French accent (except the two actors at the end).Why?Acting is pretty sub-par. Sorry but Sydney is not a great actress. And the fake voice by Justice will make you cringe the entire way.Not to mention, absurd ending.",The Voyeurs

188,grafikmilk,Major Flaw.,2,12 October 2021,There would have been an autopsy on her boyfriend and it would have been revealed it was poison. And that's that. End of film.End of Seb and Julia an - No exhibit.Also why did they go to a spa on their first meeting. Julia said coffee. That was purely there as soft core. In fact most of the nudity was gratuitous. Note Pippa's body was not shown in the spa as an audience buildup. Lame.You can only enjoy this film and give it a 8 if 1 you liked the sex and nudity and 2 suspend any idea that the story has to be logical or realistic.Regarding the whole film. I find it amusing that these were actors whose characters were supposedly acting. Which is a major flaw of this genre. You can never show an actor badly acting in character. Julia's whole deal was an act.. Er yeah she was in a film. Acting.Suspect that she's acting. Now that's cool.Sweeney does remind me of Julie Delphy. And that was the saving grace. For me.,The Voyeurs
189,sassyclassytrashbag,Good premise but kind of idiotic,4,7 November 2021,"This is an interesting movie with a set of twists that go from somewhat thrilling if predictable to just plain stupid. The problem is in the execution, especially of the ending, which is heavy-handed and full of holes. Overall, it's one of those movies that you can't quite get on board with because you can't stop wondering how the characters aren't in jail due to the fact that there's no way they'd get away with some of their public/overt behavior (see the very minor spoiler below for a couple of examples). It's also built on characters being able to predict exactly what others will do, and those others falling perfectly into their trap. The movie is a bit ruined by how silly it becomes..

199,keg-82157,Just....no,1,17 September 2021,I haven't seen a movie that was this painful to get through in awhile. I usually like Sydney Sweeney but she was completely awful in this. Not to mention the ending... omg just so incredibly bad. Save yourself the 2 hours and watch literally anything else.,The Voyeurs
200,silverscreenbuff1992,I Like to Watch,8,10 September 2021,"The Voyeurs is a fantastic erotic thriller harkening back to the days where made for video titles featuring similar plots were all the rage at the local video store - so it won't come as a surprise to seasoned fans of the genre that there are multiple twists and turns along the way when a young couple, Pippa and Thomas (played by Sydney Sweeney and Justice Smith respectively), moves into an apartment and immediately discover that they have a perfect view into the sex life of their neighbours across the street. Becoming enraptured by these strangers, it becomes an unhealthy obsession for our leads, especially Pippa as the duo buy binoculars and go to extreme, and illegal, lengths to listen in on what's being said.As with most movies of this ilk, it's best not to get dogged down by the logic or any potential plot holes - these films work due to their stylishness and eroticism and The Voyeurs features both in spades. Alongside the lovely Ms Sweeney, there's also the incredibly beautiful Natasha Liu Bordizzo as the distressed wife whose life is being spied on, plus there's plenty of nudity (both female and male) to keep everyone happy.",The Voyeurs

202,jqmartin,Peeping Tom?,7,17 September 2021,This movie was pretty good. I can usually predict the outcome of thrillers so I had an idea where this was going but the set up was good. Pippa and Thomas...give new meaning to Peeping Tom...,The Voyeurs

That fake voice ruined things for me, I stayed stuck on it so I didn't even get through the actual movie, but you don't have to be a genius to know where this movie is going to go. The two actors have no chemistry. Terrible writing as well. Avoid this film at all costs.",The Voyeurs
