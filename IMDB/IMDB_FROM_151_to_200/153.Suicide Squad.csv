0,TheLittleSongbird,"The potential was big, the waste of it was even bigger",3,30 September 2016,"'Suicide Squad' didn't sound so bad in hindsight. The concept was actually pretty interesting and there is a good deal of talent in the cast. Unfortunately what should have been a winner turned out to be a sore loser, even more of a wasted opportunity than 'Batman vs. Superman'.The costume and production design is both brooding and vibrantly colourful. There are two performances that are good. One is the enormously fun but also just as deliciously deranged Margot Robbie, her Harley Quinn being the film's most interesting character. The other is a menacing Viola Davis, proving that even a stony face makes one feel uneasy. El Diablo is also entertaining, and one of the few characters to be used right and feel necessary.However, for me Will Smith didn't work. You don't see him as Deadshot, you see him playing himself in wooden fashion here and plays Deadshot too jovially, something that Deadshot isn't really, that he also had two introductions gives an indication that the writers didn't know how to characterise the character. Enchantress is a pretty lame villain played with all cheese no menace by Cara Delevigne, while Jared Leto's Joker proves pointless and misplaced to the story (other than giving Harley Quinn backstory which wasn't fleshed out enough). Likewise with the Batman of Ben Affleck, while Killer Croc has nothing to do.One of 'Suicide Squad's' biggest failings is its treatment of the characters. Only Harley Quinn is fully fleshed out, while many characters are either given short shrift or either there was no use to them being there, for example what was the point of having Slipknot and then dispatch the character so quickly and cheaply. This is the consequences of having too many characters and a very muddled story that not only feels rushed but also incredibly confused. The script is equally a mess, with forced and very lazily-written jokes.Visually, other than the costume and set design, 'Suicide Squad' doesn't have the redeeming value of looking good. Editing is choppy and the special effects range from average at best but mostly amateurish. The action scenes are very routine and less than thrilling, chemistry is extremely limited and suspense is next to zero. Plus the music is too constant and far too loud that it becomes a nauseating assault on the ears.In conclusion, could have been a fun film but flounders badly due to lame execution that wastes its characters and much of the cast (with only Davis and particularly Robbie standing out). 3/10 Bethany Cox",Suicide Squad
1,Leofwine_draca,"A choppy, sprawling effort",5,23 September 2018,"SUICIDE SQUAD is a choppy, sprawling effort from the DC Universe from hit-or-miss director David Ayer. The idea is to have all the major villains teaming up to go on their own DIRTY DOZEN-style story in return for a reduction in their jail sentences. Sadly, the end result is choppy and imperfect, mildly entertaining here and there but failing overall. Certain elements, like Jared Leto's Joker, feel extraneous to the main story and have no real reason to be included. And the addition of an embarrassingly awful Cara Delevingne as the villain of the piece - she's no actress and never has been - is the film's nadir. However, it's not all bad. Will Smith is likeable and assured as the lead, given solid support by Joel Kinnaman and Jai Courtney. The film has an absolute ton of action to see it through, so although it's frequently silly, it's never boring, at least. It's a shame it all ends in a generic CGI way, as have pretty much all superhero flicks of the last ten years, but it's not unwatchable.",Suicide Squad
2,SnoopyStyle,actually OK with lots of annoying little problems,6,26 December 2016,"Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruits various criminals from a black site in Louisiana to battle the new unprecedented dangers. June Moone (Cara Delevingne) is an archaeologist who got possessed by a witch named Enchantress. Special forces Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) fell in love with her and leads the group. Floyd Lawton (Will Smith) is assassin Deadshot who can't miss. The most important thing in his life is his daughter. George Harkness (Jai Courtney) is Captain Boomerang. Chato Santana is El Diablo but he has turned pacifist. Waylon Jones is Killer Croc. Tatsu Yamashiro is Katana with a soul stealing sword. There is Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the psycho love of The Joker (Jared Leto). A powerful danger is unleashed in Midway City and the group is called.This was critically panned by the majority. I expected more of a mess. The story is simple and easy to follow. No doubt, there are some jarring edits with some disjointed flow. It's a little bothersome but it doesn't make it incomprehensible. The movie just keeps hitting speed bumps with annoying little problems. What's with Enchantress' movements? Her whole character is problematic. Why would Harley Quinn go back? Why would Waller kill everyone? There are varying problems in the writing. On the positive side, these are interesting characters well played by skilled actors. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto are standouts. Joker and Harley Quinn have a great story together. If anything, this shows potential for these characters into the future.",Suicide Squad
3,Hitchcoc,Just Too Much,2,28 October 2019,"I remember as a child when Universal decided to take all the monsters (Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, the hunchback, Dracula, etc.) and have them all in the same movie. These were the worst of the series.. This is another case of too many characters, no plot, no substance. I guess it won an award for costuming but the characters demand that they be costumed to be the characters. Don't bother.",Suicide Squad
4,Horst_In_Translation,Somewhere between fine and failure,4,5 October 2017,"""Suicide Squad"" is an American movie from 2016 and actually among the biggest commercial successes from last year if we look at box office revenues. Still I have a feeling they may have expected more and we will see if it was still enough for them to make a sequel at some point. Writer and director is David Ayer and he had some big Hollywood names in his cast here like Will Smith, recent Oscar winners Viola Davis and Jared Leto as well as up-and-comers Margot Robbie and Cara Delevingne. And as the film also falls into the superhero genre, even if super villain genre would be more accurate, it was somehow guaranteed a crowd magnet. Critics reception, however wasn't great at all, and the film is mentioned by many as the biggest disappointment of the year, which I do not agree with at all as it really isn't that bad. This did not keep the Oscars though from giving it an Academy Award and yes makeup and hair-styling are really among the not too many strengths this film had. The characters' looks, also during the long introduction, early on are definitely something that elevated the mediocre and frequently very generic material. I am referring here to the father-daughter story, the fire villain's fear from causing destruction and other story lines too. They never become as emotional, let alone memorable, as they were intended too.And then there is Harley Quinn, maybe the film's most memorable character, but I also think that had more to do with the physical side than with the way Robbie played her. Admittedly, I did not find Robbie as bad or forgettable as she was in other roles, so maybe she was just a good casting decision. Still the way they used her character as a trigger for comedy looking at how insane she was did get repetitive quickly. Same goes for the ways in which Viola Davis was treated by all the villains like such a respectable, bad-ass character with so much authority that it was fairly cringeworthy. Besides, the ways in which the film tried to go for comedy like a villain equivalent to Guardians of the Galaxy was rarely successful at all and felt pretty forced most of the time. It's probably just not Ayer's genre. So going for a full gritty and dark approach would have been the better solution.Finally, a couple words on Leto's Joker. I think he is a talented actor and the character is really epic, but somehow it wasn't working out at all. I would not blame the makeup, but something didn't feel right there. I am saying this as somebody who is not a Ledger fanboy at all, but actually preferred Nicholson's take on the character I think. Let's hope Leto is back to his best with future projects (like the Blade Runner sequel) as he is too talented to appear in so few films only like he did for a while when he focused on his singing career. Here we have a really long film at easily over 2 hours, which is not too surprising for the genre, but sadly the quality is not on par with the quantity. It is maybe worth seeing for the occasional entertainment factor and as a pointless fun film overall, but depth and creativity are almost non-existent here. You won't find anything in here you haven't seen before already and frequently better. That's why I give the final outcome a thumbs-down and even if it was a close call, I don't recommend the watch.",Suicide Squad
5,Prismark10,The dirty crew,5,19 May 2017,"I think I saw this film many years ago. It was called The Dirty Dozen and it had a more coherent plot.Suicide Squad is a combination of bad asses from the world of DC comics as intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a team of meta-humans, that is humans with some superpowers to defend the world the next time the world encounters a villain with the powers that Superman has. I think Waller describes a situation of who would save the world if someone took the roof of the White House and entered the Oval Office, which is exactly what happened in Superman II.The Suicide Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). To keep them in check is Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) who is also seeking to rescue his lover Dr June Moone who is possessed by the evil Enchantress (Cara Delevingne.)Everyone has a back story but the film concentrates mainly on Deadshot and Harley Quinn with the Joker (Jared Leto) popping in as a strategic and unfunny guest villain.The story is a bit of a mess with a weak plot and most of the action located on a sound stage shot at night time. You know this group of bad people will defy authority, plan to escape and eventually bond to take on the villains which seems to be some kind of CGI monsters who conveniently get shot, slashed, banged or knocked out by a baseball bat. Some of the anti heroes do not have super powers at all but people like Diablo or Killer Croc do.Although I admire Leto's take on the Joker, he was messily written and I expected silly humour from him which was non existent here.Still Warner Brother's have learned from Marvel and included an eclectic soundtrack, they have at least made the film entertaining. I just think their world of heroes lacked the cohesiveness that Marvel have achieved and this is mainly down to a sub par screenplay.",Suicide Squad
6,claudio_carvalho,Deceptive Film with a Lame Story,5,9 October 2016,"After the death of Superman, the leader of a secret agency Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) convinces the government to recruit super-villains imprisoned in Belle Eve to protect the world. She summons the hit-man Deadshot (Will Smith); The Joker's girlfriend and former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie); the pyrokinetic Diablo (Jay Hernandez); the bank thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney); the mutant Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje); the criminal Slipknot (Adam Beach); and the witch Enchantress that possessed the former archaeologist June Moone (Cara Delevingne) to form The Task Force X. Waller also assigns the command of the team to Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), who is in love with June. To convince the group to obey orders, a nano bomb is implanted in the neck of each member. When Enchantress releases her powerful brother and they besiege Midway City turning the residents into an army of monsters and building a powerful weapon. Meanwhile The Joker (Jared Leto) is plotting a plan to rescue his beloved Harley Quinn.""Suicide Squad"" is a deceptive film with a lame story and terrible director that waste a magnificent cast. Margot Robbie steals the show and Jared Leto makes a creepy The Joker, but it is not enough to save this film. Waller killing her own team is not dark, but awful. The CGI is poor and the best is the music score with classic rock. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Esquadrão Suicida"" (""Suicide Squad"")",Suicide Squad
7,nogodnomasters,We're the bad guys. It's what we do.,10,24 October 2017,"This film follows on the heels of the Batman vs Superman film with THE plot spoiler for that film. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is a tough lady head of a secret agency in charge of national security. She puts together a group of criminals, who dubbed themselves ""Suicide Squad"" to take care of any meta-human problem should some superhero decide to go rogue.The first part of the film introduces all the characters with appropriate swagger music. Then a big fight happens at Midway City, something you would expect to be Chicago, but filmed in Toronto. Jared Leto who plays the Joker in this feature is slated to continue the role in the upcoming ""Justice League."" Margot Robbie who played Harley Quinn had all the good lines and stole every scene she was in...okay Will Smith was good too.Guide: 1 brief F-word, No sex, or nudity.",Suicide Squad
8,kosmasp,Suicide Mission,6,2 March 2017,"You'd expect people to say that about DC trying to place themselves as a worthy opponent and rival to Marvel. And while in the Comic Book world it is a competition, it's hard to see that in the Movie universe happening anytime soon. Which is a shame when you think that this also could've been so much better.While I've only seen the cinematic version (not the extended one), this unfortunately wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped for. Still it wasn't all bad. What was almost all bad strangely enough, was Harley Quinn. The trailer promised a lot, but apart from kind of like every funny line being in there, they didn't work in the movie itself. They felt all wrong and I don't fault the Margot Robbie for that. Also the inciting incident is so crazy, I wonder if anyone actually can just swallow that pill without going blank and kind of crazy.There are a lot of good actors involved in this and they alone warrant a viewing of this. Also the action, no matter how far fetched and stretched it may seem, kind of works too. Just do not compare it under no circumstances with Guardians ...",Suicide Squad
9,Sleepin_Dragon,Not my cup of tea,3,4 November 2018,"I sometimes feel a little disenfranchised as I'm not a liver if superhero type films, but I'll always compromise and see them. Perhaps I'm just unlucky, I was made to sit through Batman Vs Superman, and then this, I felt as if I were being punished. Two hours of wall to wall nonsense, there was virtually no plot of any kind, or what there was went over my head. I can't say the acting was bad, Will Smith I really liked, and despite not particularly being a huge fan, I'd say one of Cara Delevingne's better performances.Some great special effects, perhaps a film if have enjoyed if I was twelve. At this very time I'd have to say I thought it was very poor. 3/10",Suicide Squad
10,classicsoncall,"""Don't forget, we're the bad guys.""",7,21 May 2017,"I held off watching this flick for the primary reason that I thought it would be more like ""Deadpool"", with liberal use of the 'F' word and an unhealthy balance of sex and violence for a comic book based movie. So the good surprise here is that the DC folks didn't further lower the bar on entertainment value by going for the cheap and nasty.On the flip side though, the story falls victim to that ever present need to fill the screen with the most over the top action sequences the film makers can to rid the world of the latest all powerful villain menace bent on dominating the planet. It gets so repetitious after a while that it almost legislates against seeing the next picture to come out because you know it will just be more of the same.Taken individually, I did get a kick out of the principal players. Margot Robbie's take on Harley Quinn and Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker were about the best one could expect of actors who have mentally challenged characters to portray. It's interesting to contrast Leto's Joker with Heath Ledger's in ""The Dark Knight"". Ledger's was more of an extremist, almost a terrorist one might say, whereas Leto came at the character as someone who was deranged. I didn't think anyone could top Ledger's performance as The Joker at the time, but Leto's performance now gives me pause.As for the rest, the remaining meta-humans to join the Squad were OK, but there wasn't much time to focus on their characters with Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn doing most of the heavy lifting. As for squad leader Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), he seemed almost superfluous except for his connection to June Moone/The Enchantress (Cara Deleningne). The ease with which Harley managed to fake out Enchantress and steal her heart seemed like a total let down with global domination at stake. Same thing with Incubus, a potential bad guy with the power of a Superman, yet he got dusted by a fiery opponent and blown up. Doesn't say much for world threatening super-villains.Well it's a been there, done that viewing for me and I'd like to be a bit more positive about the picture but it was just something to get out of the way. The after credit scene didn't much inspire to see the follow up sequel, if in fact there is one. Judging by the amount of negative reviews on this board, there might be reason to reconsider.",Suicide Squad
11,jboothmillard,Suicide Squad,4,19 August 2016,"The trailer for this DC Comics based movie looked great, many of the most well known supervillains brought together, I was certainly hoping it would be an improvement on the awful Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, directed by David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, Training Day, End of Watch, Fury). Basically in the aftermath of Superman's death, at Belle Reve Penitentiary, intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) has assembled a team of dangerous criminals: former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), elite hit man Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot (Will Smith), pyrokinetic ex-gangster El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), opportunistic thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), monstrous cannibal Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and specialised assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach). Under the command of Colonel Rick Flag (RoboCop's Joel Kinnaman), the team are to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the U.S. government, the criminals are told their individual sentences will be reduced, and they have small bombs implanted in their necks, which will detonate if any try to rebel or escape. Former archaeologist and Flag's girlfriend June Moone (Cara Delevingne) was intended recruit, touching a cursed idol she is possessed by a witch-goddess known as ""Enchantress"", she has turned on everyone and wants to eradicate mankind, she has surrounded Midway City with monsters, begun creating a weapon, and summoned her brother Incubus (Alain Chanoine) to assist her. The squad is deployed and briefed, they are under the impression they are tackling a terrorist attack, but they are convinced it is a suicide mission, they are joined by mystic sword wielding Katana (Karen Fukuhara), she is acting as Flag's bodyguard. Meanwhile, Harley's lover, psychopathic supervillain the Joker (Razzie nominated Jared Leto) finds out about her predicament, he tortures Waller's man Griggs (Ike Barinholtz) and is lead to the facility where the nano bombs are made, the Joker blackmails a scientist into disabling Harley's bomb. The team's helicopter is shot down as they approach, forcing them to continue on foot, Slipknot is convinced by Boomerang the bombs are a ruse to keep them under control, he is killed attempting to escape, while the Enchantress' minions attack the team. The team manage to escape and reach a safe room, where they learn Waller herself is their mark, she is trying to cover her involvement, the squad escort Waller to the roof for extraction, but the Joker and his men have hijacked the helicopter, they open fire while Harley climbs aboard, however they are shot down, Harley jumps out while the Joker seemingly perishes in the explosion, Harley rejoins the team. Waller is kidnapped by the Enchantress' minions, while Deadshot confronts Flag about secret files found with the truth about the Enchantress, the squad members and Katana leave Flag after he confesses the truth, with Waller compromised, Flag chooses to continue and relieves the squad of the mission. The team realise they have the opportunity to prove themselves, they rejoin Flag, locate the Enchantress and Waller at a partially flooded subway station, the squad fight the Enchantress and her forces, while Killer Croc and Navy Seals, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards (Scott Eastwood, Clint's son), plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and manages to hold Incubus down, the bomb goes off underneath, El Diablo, Incubus and Edwards are killed, the squad members are defeated battling Enchantress, in exchange for their allegiance she offers to fulfil their deepest desires, Harley appears to accept in order to get close to Enchantress and cut her heart out. The weapon is destroyed by explosives thrown by Killer Croc and shot by Deadshot, Enchantress' heart is crushed by Flag, Enchantress is killed and June is freed, Waller emerges alive and the squad members are returned to Belle Rave with ten years off their sentences. In the end, all but Captain Boomerang have special privileges, the Joker breaks out Harley, and Waller meets Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), who agrees to protect her backlash, in exchange for access to government files on the expanding metahuman community. Also starring Common as Monster T, Jim Parrack as Frost, David Harbour as Dexter Tolliver and We Need to Talk About Kevin's Ezra Miller as The Flash. Smith is great as the expert assassin, Robbie is terrifically mad and flirtatious as Harley Quinn (the big screen live action debut for the character, introduced in Batman: The Animated Series), Leto is a questionable alternative Joker with gold teeth and tattoos, Delevingne is rather average as the witch wanting to take over the world, Davis is menacing, and some of the other supporting stars do well. It has a brilliant soundtrack, including Grace feat. G-Eazy - ""You Don't Own Me"", Eminem"" Without Me"", The Animals - ""The House of the Rising Sun"", Creedence Clearwater Revival - ""Fortunate Son"", Black Sabbath - ""Paranoid"", The White Stripes - ""Seven Nation Army"", Norman Greenbaum - ""Spirit in the Sky"", K7 - ""Come Baby Come"" and Queen - ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". It seems that the trend of superhero movies are dominated by the more successful Marvel Universe, but this is certainly better than the last offering from DC. The special effects and makeup are fantastic, there are small flaws, the story is only just passable, the editing style can be a bit much, and the over-the-top action and stunts border on ridicuous, but there is some fun to be had, it's not a bad anti-superhero fantasy action film. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screenplay for David Ayer. Okay!",Suicide Squad
12,Tweekums,The 'Dirty Dozen' with super-villains,7,21 April 2019,"After the death of Superman those in power worry how the Earth would cope if the next super-powered being to turn up used their power to defeat rather than help humanity. To that end Task Force X, AKA the Suicide Squad, is established; a group made up of the most dangerous super-villains who have been captured! Of course they cannot be trusted but with an explosive charge placed in their necks they might just behave. When a threat emerges they are led by Col Rick Flag to confront that threat... which just happens to involve the woman Flag loves.Even before I watched this I'd heard it was pretty terrible... I wouldn't say it was that bad but it could have been so much better. Too much of the film's opening was dedicated to showing us how the various villains got caught; something that wasn't really necessary. Then when the action started much of it was too dark... as in it was hard to see what was happening. Tonally it wasn't dark enough; these are meant to be super-villains but the film didn't seem that violent... it would have been better had it been as violent as 'Kick-Ass' or even 'Dredd' but I guess the makers wanted a teen-friendly rating. The cast are solid enough; Margot Robbie stole just about every scene she was in with her performance as the crazy and dangerous, but still likeable Harley Quinn; Jared Leto impressed as The Joker, although his character wasn't in the Squad and was sorely underused. Overall I'd say this was entertaining enough but if you expect something great you are likely to be disappointed.",Suicide Squad
13,BA_Harrison,Dismal Crap.,3,19 November 2017,"As much as I prefer the DC universe over Marvel, those behind the movies seem unable to replicate the ingenuity and entertainment level of superhero competitors Marvel. Pretty much every movie DC have produced since the turn of the millennium has been disappointing (and yes, I do include Nolan's vastly over-rated Batman trilogy in that statement).Suicide Squad is no exception a chaotic mess of a movie that lingers in the mind for about as long as it takes the Flash to nip to the shops and back. Writer/director David Ayer clearly hopes that the novelty of a team of super-villains will be enough to carry the movie, but he's wrong: Suicide Squad is desperately in need of a creative driving force who is more concerned with telling a decent story than showcasing his cool characters and blowing his budget on an arsenal of trendy graphics and expensive CGI special effects.As far as the cast are concerned, Will Smith is adequate as Deadshot, the world's greatest hit-man, Margot Robbie's butt is great as Harley Quinn's butt, and Karen Fukuhara as Katana ably fulfils the token Asian hottie role for the overseas market, but everyone else is bland and instantly forgettable, including Jared Leto as the worst incarnation of the Joker to ever grace the silver screen. And whoever thought that the world's ugliest supermodel, Cara Delevingne, would make for an imposing villainess needs their head checked: she's dreadful.",Suicide Squad
14,paul_haakonsen,They are bad guys! It is what they do...,6,8 October 2016,"While I am not overly much fan of the superhero genre as such, then ""Suicide Squad"" was sort of a most welcomed addition to the genre. Why? Well because you have a group of less than savory characters gifted with super powers, so you don't have to witness a group of goody two shoes running around trying to save the Earth while doing what is morally and ethically sound and politically correct. It was refreshing to have a bunch of baddies running around and dealing out punishment while trying to save the Earth. Yeah, it still has that oh-so-glorious-saving-the-Earth element to it.Now, ""Suicide Squad"" falls right into the same alley as Christopher Nolan's darkly set Batman movies, and it fits right in there. Oh, and Batman is actually also in this movie, so go figure...While the movie is titled ""Suicide Squad"", it might as well have been named ""Harley Quinn"" or something like that, because this movie was essentially about her because she was so often the focal point that most of the other bad guys (read protagonists here) sort of fell a bit in the background and were looming in her shadow.The movie does have some interesting characters. First and foremost, and which is not a shocker nor a surprise to anyone, is Harley Quinn (played formidably by Margot Robbie). Now I am not familiar with her character from the comic books, so I have no base of comparison, but what I saw in this movie was impressive.Then there is Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), whom actually was a surprise of a character, because I had initially written the character off as being just another brawny goon. But it turned out that the character was quite interesting.Right up alongside Harley Quinn in terms of being interesting was Enchantress (played by Cara Delevingne). That character design, when she was in her shadow-form, was amazing. And it was actually one of the most memorable and impressive of characters that I have seen in a superhero movie, and would definitely like to see a spin off movie with this character - and also a movie with Harley Quinn, of course.Deadshot was also an interesting enough character, but I think that having cast Will Smith for the role was not the right actor. Sure he is talented, but he just didn't sit well with me in this particular role.Katana was also a character that had potential, but the character wasn't really fully utilized or put to proper use throughout the course of the movie. And it is also a character that would be suitable for a solo movie. The actress Karen Fukuhara was a great choice for the character, and she more than lived up to the part. Just a shame that the character was sort of cut short on screen time. However, the name Katana is just stupid. Why name yourself after your choice of weapon? Sure, I get the part with the katana stealing the souls of the ones killed by its blade, but come on...And while we are on the characters, then I must say that I was struggling hard with taking Jared Leto serious in the role as The Joker. It was mostly because of the teeth grills. It just made the character look like a pathetic white wannabe gangsta. And it was totally unjustifiable for the iconic character that The Joker is. Certain aspects to Jared Leto's performance was good enough, but I just couldn't look past his pathetic appearance, and it took away so much from the character and its importance to the movie.""Suicide Squad"" is an entertaining action movie for what it turned out to be. It is not a movie that challenges the intellect of the audience in the least. This is pure and simple a lean-back-and-enjoy-the-action types of movies. And that is adequate enough, and director David Ayer did a good enough job with this movie.The effects in the movie were good and they more than lives up to the things they were supposed to bring out on the screen. And for a movie such as this, then special effects and CGIs that are realistic and believable is important.""Suicide Squad"" is definitely a movie that was needed to the superhero genre, just like ""Watchmen"" was back in 2009. Just keep in mind that this is a predictable movie, driven by one-liners, special effects and quirky characters.",Suicide Squad
15,Quinoa1984,"a barely fresh 'Tomato', but fresh nonetheless (READ the review first please!)",3,4 August 2016,"Call it the Rule of Very Low Expectations, but by this rule I had a good time with this movie. It's not the Fantastic Four level disaster you've heard. Is it nihilistic? A little, though not anywhere near some other films this year (not to say it's as good as those, i.e. Deadpool), and the fact that this was green-lit and conceived in the shadow of Guardians of the Galaxy is painfully obvious (i.e. Killer Croc = Groot, more or less). But David Ayer as a director AND writer, coming from a gnarly, south LA cops-and-criminals kind of cinematic background (remember his breakthrough was Training Day), creates his own playground to work in, and though Batman from the Goddamn Synder-verse appears it's really his own making this time - it's a colorful film to look at (not as ""artistic"" as the other neon film by Refn, but close), and while it's an ensemble it gets two really fantastic actors and anti-hero/villain characters: Deadshot (Will Smith, in the best I've seen him in almost ten years, fully entertaining in his Will Smith but grungier, more cynical, and he is fully acting here and giving it his all even when the script lets him down), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robibie, who I assume was created because she's one of those people the camera just loves, and she loves this character and it shows).They're the driving force here amid a group of motley characters and actors - some better than others, i.e. it was impossible not to think of Jai Courtney, having fun much as he is, as a discount Tom Hardy since he dropped out of the role, and Jay Hernandez who brings a lot to a character that is basically Fire Hulk - and that helps when it becomes clear that when this Squad that's been assembled, with a mostly entertaining series of backstories in the opening act, are put into a fairly generic and problematic plot that climaxes with (uh, spoilers?) the actual homage to Ghostbusters 84 for this summer(!) I think if I looked at the disappointments to have with the film they would be there, like how Cara Delvegine (sic) carries some real screen presence as the villain but she is just another in a long line of comic book movie villains that want to take over/destroy the world for mystifying-stupid reasons, and the Joker is surprisingly completely ancillary to the plot (and Leto makes me pine for Ledger's good but overrated performance as the Joker - like, I really miss him now he's so snarly and ugly and his-heart-isn't-in-this performance). But thinking about the movie some hours after, I find more to like about it than I don't: a lot of it comes down to the potential that is here with these characters and their powers, how they play off of one another, their energy and how they appear (Killer Croc is... NOT a CGI creation, yes, it's possible!) and how sometimes the plot flashbacks work (again with Diablo, the Jay Hernandez character, I felt Ayer coming through the most via his South LA filmmaking roots, and that's a good thing here).So I can nitpick this and it's probably a mixed bag. But I was not actively annoyed or bored - climax the one exception - and it provides its actors some strong moments to shine. It's not actively brooding or trying to be DARK in some hamfisted way that doesn't work. Its flaws are not from some terrible 'moments-driven' vision like a Snyder, nor is it talky-philosophical like a Nolan film. It's as acceptable today as it would be if it had come out circa 2002, which is about right. In other words, it's a decent dark-light refitting of the 'GotG' formula, and it's adequate!

Will someone please tell me how accomplished Oscar winner Viola Davis subjected herself to such a miserable film.No, this is not exactly 1967's ""The Dirty Dozen,"" where deviants are forced to fight the Nazis. This instead is right out of a comic book fancy with unimaginable villains in prison recruited to fight evil forces threatening to destroy the world.There is enough shooting for ten life-times. The special effects is about the only good thing in this mess of a film.My two favorite female deviants in the film were the psychiatrist who went astray due to her love for an inmate and the archaeologist who fell into the wrong underpass and had a negative life-altering experience.It becomes confusing when some of the deviants join with our crusaders.Evil was really never this bad.",Suicide Squad
17,Scarecrow-88,Suicide Squad,6,4 September 2016,"With nearly 1400 user comments as of this writing, I will just keep it short and sweet: villains like a sniper working for the highest bidder (Will Smith; he loves his little girl, though!), a former psychologist who fell for psychopath Joker (Jared Leto, more cartoonish mad, not immersed in darkness like Heath Ledger was as the character) and was electro-shocked by him which pretty much warped her mental state turning her into a hot, tattooed maniac (Margot Robbie, who stole the film), among others imprisoned and kept under lock and key until a government Pentagon sociopath (Viola Davis, about as cold-blooded as the villains of the movie assembled) urges the military to allow her to use them for missions, covert and to combat the possible Superman that might not hold onto the same values as the *dead* Caped Crusader did.Jon Kinnaman (The Killing) is a badass soldier Davis puts in charge of the Suicide Squad (coined by Smith when acknowledging that the current mission in this movie might lead to their demise), with a device that holds the lives of the villains in his hands (an explosive device is implanted in the bodies). An ""enchantress"" was discovered in a religious artifact hidden in a cave by archaeologist (Cara Delevingne), taking over her body. Davis has the witch's heart in a case and wants her to do her bidding, but the enchantress resurrects her brother, placing his soul (from a similar artifact) in common, getting power from him to combat the heart's absence. This plot is just so absurdly silly, that even writing it gives me chuckles. Jai Courtney, of the Divergent movies, is Boomerang, an Aussie safecracker, Jay Hernandez as a gangster with flame as a weapon, Diablo, who has reformed himself after his family was killed during an outburst, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as ""killer croc"" (imagine a croc-man), Karen Fukuhara as the awesome swordswoman, Katana, whose blade when it kills folks traps their souls in it (!), and Adam Beach (wasted) as Slipknot round out the cast. Smith, of course, as Deadshot, brings his star power charisma while Margot Robbie blows away everyone on screen as Harley Quinn. Quinn gets the best lines while Smith is clearly a rung above the others, although Kinnaman is no slouch when the two are together (and they are a lot because the plot adversarially pits them against each other). Courtney is fun, but Hernandez (under Day of the Dead facial makeup) is amazing. Damn good cast in search of a better superhero movie. Leto is hyperactive, with tattoos (Damaged in cursive on his forehead) and gold teeth (?!?!), representing a type of manic Mafioso feared by all. Great scene has Margot Robbie proving to Joker she loved him, dropping off into a vat of goo. The smeared mascara, bikini shorts, ""Daddy's Lil Monster"" tight shirt, baseball bat, and ""Love/Hate"" bullet chamber gun; Harley Quinn is quite a showy part for Robbie. The ""machine"" the enchantress whips up with her magic and the monster brother with extending ""arms"" that level everything with this branch-like residue, laying waste to all it attacks are massive special effects sequences, a subway station particularly devastated. The enchantress merely grasps folks and transforms them into hideous monsters with faces that ""bubble"". The Diablo fire god opposing Monster T at the end is impressive. Smith proving to Davis and Kinnaman he's a good shot while still in prison is also a highlight. Major problem forced on director Ayer: having to deal with so many characters introduced, as backstories are rushed to get to the mission. Harley Quinn is destined for her own movie.",Suicide Squad
18,preppy-3,Not good but I enjoyed it.,7,14 August 2016,"A bunch of super-powered villains are picked by the US government to protect the world against any potential super threats. However they each have a little bomb implanted in their throats. If they rebel or try to escape they'll be killed. Then someone named the Enchantress attacks and plans to take over the world (I think). The villains are let loose to battle her.This movie is pretty good for the first 30 minutes. It sets up the story and characters swiftly and neatly. Then when the Enchantress starts setting up her plot the film falls apart. It makes next to no sense! I kept watching it trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally I just gave up. I turned off my mind, settled back and watched things go BOOM for the remainder of the film. It SORT OF makes sense but not if you examine it too closely. The reshoots on the film are obvious and muddy the waters more. There's lots of action and violence and great special effects. I can't fault the acting. Everyone is good in their roles--especially Margot Robbie who steals the show as Harley Quinn. The only bad acting is by Will Smith as Deadpool. Very wooden and uninteresting. Also Batman and Flash pop up briefly, So is it a good movie? No but I had fun watching it. A 7.",Suicide Squad
19,CinemaSerf,Suicide Squib!,6,14 October 2021,"What an unmitigated waste of an opportunity. A carte-blanche of an idea - let's accumulate a collection of villains: people without scruples, and ensure that they use their undoubted, and deadly, skills to save us all from whatever threat we are facing in return for (limited) rehabilitation into society. Before long, they have their challenge - a mysterious entity that is hell bent on world domination, and there is to be no place for mankind. Off they go - safe in the knowledge that if they stray from their mission, a small explosive in their head will soon make their choices a lot simpler! The gang are the beginning of my problems with this - Will Smith (""Deadshot"" - or is there a wrong vowel in there somewhere); the cute Jared Leto (""The Joker"") and Margot Robbie's entirely obnoxious ""Harley Quinn"" just don't gel at all. Smith - with his peculiarly shaven head - is not remotely convincing as a the man he is supposed to be, and though Robbie's character has more to work with: horrid and slightly bonkers, even that just falls flat. There is loads of action, but most of the time that just recycles itself allowing each of the characters to have a few moments of screen time before the pretty hopeless story moves along to an ending we can see from space. Of course it looks good, the costumes and visual effects, make up and sound design are top drawer - but so what? That is what eats up most of the $175m budget. How about spending some more of that on a decent script with a coherent plot that actually creates a story, rather than a collection of set-piece, expertly choreographed action scenes that are just all a bit passé? Sorry, this ought to have been much, much better...",Suicide Squad
20,zardoz-13,A Change of Pace For Super Hero Movies,8,23 August 2016,"As the follow-up to ""Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" ""Fury"" director David Ayer's DC Comics extravaganza ""The Suicide Squad"" qualifies as a gritty, slam-bang, straight-faced, but formulaic action thriller. Although far from realistic in an any conventional sense, Ayer's ensemble epic casts a dark shadow over everything that it depicts and its unsavory psychotic felons tangle with powerful mystical entities from an ancient era. Specifically, the chief villain is almost seven thousand years old and relies on magical incantations. Clearly, the ostensible difference between DC Comics movies and Disney's Marvel movies is night and day, with DC preferring the dark, while Marvel basks in the daylight. Unlike The House of Mouse's Marvel costume-clad, crime fighters, ""Squad"" doesn't sugarcoat either its costume-clad convicts or its sinister shenanigans. Interestingly enough, Twentieth Century Fox's three Marvel franchises (""X-Men,"" ""Fantastic Four,"" and ""Deadpool"") land somewhere between DC and Disney. Whereas the ""Captain America: Civil War"" characters survived miraculously to fight another day, some ""Suicide Squad"" characters die. Most of the characters in ""Suicide Squad"" are as repugnant as they are unrepentant, and I don't mean just the heinous criminals that the Government has recruited for Task Force X to perform their unscrupulous chores. The trigger-happy dame who assembles these dastards is pretty despicable herself. Unless you're a literate DC Comics bibliophile, you may not be familiar with the Suicide Squad but they bear some resemblance to Marvel Comics' Avengers but altogether lack their charisma. Historically, the first ""Suicide Squad"" bore little resemblance to the cinematic ""Suicide Squad."" Captain Rick Flag and his girlfriend Karin Grace, Dr. Hugh Evans, and Jess Bright battled monsters back in 1959 in DC Comics' ""The Brave and The Bold."" They were all humans and flew jet-bombers. In 1987, DC Comics' Legends Crossover graphic series introduced the new ""Suicide Squad"" that consisted of an assemblage of super-convicts, such as Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and Enchantress, similar to those in Ayer's film.As ""Suicide Squad"" unfolds, Superman is still dead and gone. Street vendors sell 'Remember' T-shirts commemorating the last son of Krypton. Although Clark Kent's alter-ego doesn't show up for this clash of the titans, anybody with half-a-brain should know that Superman will eventually make an encore appearance. Indeed, Warner Brothers and DC Comics have plans in the pipeline for a ""Man of Steel"" sequel. Nevertheless, Superman is nowhere to be seen here, and an unscrupulous, top-level government official, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis of ""The Help""), fears that the next extraterrestrials may not be as benevolent as the Man of Steel. Consequently, she is mobilizing a gang of costume-clad, super-convicts that she classifies as ""the worst of the worst."" When she presents Task Force X, the National Security Council initially wants nothing to do with it. The Pentagon thinks that Waller's idea is foolhardy. In short order, Waller changes their minds. She dispatches one of her motley crew, the witch-goddess Enchantress, aka June Moon (Cara Delevingne of ""Paper Towns""), and Enchantress swipes a top-secret document from Iran that the Pentagon has been desperately trying to seize without success. An ex-Arkham Asylum psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie of ""Focus""); a cream of the crop assassin Deadshot (Will Smith of ""Concussion""); a guilt-stricken pyromaniac El Diablo (Jay Hernandez of ""Hostel""); a sociopathic Australian bank robber Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney of ""Terminator Genysis""); a mutant half-man, half-crocodile cannibal Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of ""Pompeii""); and a specialized assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach of ""Cowboys & Aliens"") constitute Waller's group. Rounding out this diversified outfit of unsavory savages is an implacable female ninja, Katana (Karen Fukuhara), armed with a bizarre samurai sword which traps the souls of all who die by its blade. Actually, she serves to protect the group's commander, Special Forces Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman of ""Robocop""), who has a genius for strategic planning. Oddly enough, Flag is involved romantically with June Moon, an archaeologist who blundered into the wrong cave and encountered the spirit of the Enchantress. Unlike the other members of the Suicide Squad who bide their time in a miserable Louisiana dungeon, June and the creepy Enchantress share the same body. Think of the split-personality of the Enchantress and June Moon as a variation on Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Whenever Waller requires June to summon the Enchantress, this untrustworthy 7,000-year old sorceress takes over June's body. Meantime, an elite team of Seals, led by Captain G.Q. Edwards (Scott Eastwood of ""Fury""), are around to mop up what the Suicide Squad doesn't wipe out.""The Suicide Squad'' differs from ""Batman Vs Superman."" Although Batman appears momentarily in two scenes while Bruce Wayne puts in a cameo appearance, the costume-clad convicts dominate matters in ""The Suicide Squad."" They carry or conceal standard-issue weapons, and their outfits aren't as colorful as either Batman or Superman. El Diablo comes the closest to being a superhero because he can transform himself into an incendiary human torch on impulse. Enchantress makes a strong adversary because she can conjure up things out of thin air. At one point, she summons the spirit of her long-lost brother to help her subjugate mankind. Second, ""The Suicide Squad"" resembles a zombie combat movie. Our anti-heroic team marches through the apocalyptic wreckage of Midway City as if they were soldiers entering a recently bombed city. The Witch-Goddess Enchantress possesses the power to turn Flag's own men against him. She kills Flag's soldiers and reconstitutes them as her hooligans. In this sense, Enchantress' army behaves like the zombies from ""The Walking Dead,"" and they whittle down our heroes. If a witch-goddess with an army of zombies weren't enough with which to contend, our heroes clash with the Joker (Jared Leto of ""The Dallas Buyers Club"") who pops up as a largely peripheral villain to rescue his sweetheart Harley Quinn.Clocking in at two hours and three minutes, ""The Suicide Squad"" doesn't provide enough detail about some characters, but director David Ayes doesn't squander a second as he parades the convicts to the brink of extinction.",Suicide Squad
21,grantss,"Entertaining, and better than expected",7,17 June 2017,"With Superman dead, the world needs a new band of superheroes to step into the breach. Senior US Intelligence officer Amanda Waller comes up with a daring plan - use extreme criminals with special abilities to fight crime, in exchange for them receiving reduced sentences. The band of crime-fighting criminals is officially known as Task Force X, but due to the nature of their mission a more appropriate name would be Suicide Squad. Reasonably entertaining. Starts off very well - the background and scene setting were great and promised much for the remainder of the movie. Unfortunately, the remainder doesn't quite live up to this promise, as the plot loses focus to an extent.This all said, the movie has great momentum and is never boring. There are some great action scenes and dialogue and the performances provide a great energy to the movie. The standout (for many reasons!) is Margot Robbie who is excellent as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is great as The Joker (the character seems to inspire great performances - thinking Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the past). Solid work too from Will Smith, as Deadshot, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.After all the criticism of the movie, it was much better than expected. I can only think it was your typical comic book and superhero movie fans who were disappointed, as this movie is a bit different to most of the genre. I've never read the Suicide Squad comics, and generally am not a fan of comic book / superhero movies, so was able to watch with any preconceived ideas of what this should be like.

New York City Tycoon Trump, indicates--as the Trumpster keeps telling us--that Hillary/Viola MUST be stopped, one way if not another. Warner shows us that Hillary/Viola can easily fall prey to the Forces of Evil. (When her Emails are compromised, she just shoots her IT people in the head!) Trump echoed Warner's warning this week when he revealed that Hillary founded the dread terror SUICIDE SQUAD known as ISIS. During the course of this movie version of SUICIDE SQUAD, Hillary's alter ego--""The Witch""--turns the citizens of Midway City into some sort of mindless cancerous zombie army, which can only be stopped when Will Smith shoots them in the head (before they can reach the voting booths).

But which half?,5,12 August 2016,"A Dirty Dozen consisting of Metahumans is sent into a city to deal with something requiring their abilities – can they be trusted? Gritty, offensive, authentic... as a huge fan of all things David Ayer, this is most definitely one of his films. A very diluted one, however. He brings some of his own weaknesses, and he's hampered by his first directorial PG-13, that he pushes like Sisyphus would, fitting into a franchise that hasn't much resembled his style before now, *and* the re-shoots and haphazard editing of a number of executives screaming about how their, rather expensive, properties keep failing in spite of seemingly built-in promises of profit. It's amazing it's not a complete mess. Then again, some say it is. The single biggest problem is that for all the great action and distinct personality, it doesn't fully grab you.There are quite a few questionable decisions, in particular on visual design. Dancing fire figures, grills in place of scarring, a villain similar to Thor's Destroyer, the list goes on. In spite of practical FX being the go-to, there ends up being too much CGI. The animal and Aussie might as well have been written out – all anyone would say is ""they were in the comic, though"". When this tries for drama, we often get sap. The pacing and flow are all over the place, with flashbacks strewn about as if someone dropped a box of them on the floor.There is a ton of material that is very disturbing, violent and/or painted-over-gory in this. I recommend this to any fan of the DCEU(both of you), the source material, and, of course, those trailers... no, really, they did fit nearly every single one of those songs in there.

25,view_and_review,"Squad Good, Nemeses Bad",6,9 January 2017,"The crux of most comic book movies is meta-humans (as DC calls them) or superheroes. The quality of that movie will be largely based upon the abilities of said super beings although a good story wouldn't hurt. Now we're at a near saturation point with comic book movies which absolutely necessitates a good tale as well as some very unique skill sets from the heroes. If the skill sets are not very unique those abilities better be displayed in a new and unique way.Suicide Squad was a collection of meta-humans (though one of the members wasn't really meta she was just meh) that were tasked with helping extract a VIP from a super-villain stronghold. Of the members of this motley crew I think Deadshot (Will Smith) was the most likable. He was witty and had the most character. Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje), and Boomerang (Jai Courtney) were just there and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) was a nuisance. Her character, beyond being superfluous, was very annoying with her on- again off-again pseudo-Brooklyn accent. But this was the Suicide Squad and I watch comic book movies.The story and the climactic battle were very so-so. Whereas I did have a concerted interest in who won the battle, I wasn't very impressed with the nemesis; and that's a problem. Besides being a demigod type character the main nemesis kept gyrating as though that was the source of her power. It just looked ridiculous.Along with these mankind-hating meta-meanies I wasn't keen on the unnecessary additions of Harley Quinn and the Joker (Jared Leto). I know I'm speaking from a position of Suicide Squad source material ignorance but I'm grading the movie like a novice as most viewers will be. Harley Quinn and the Joker were almost a side story that--beyond being distracting--was irritating. Jared Leto is the third rendition of the Joker (post 1989) and his is the worst in my opinion. Jack Nicholson was somewhat humorous, Heath Ledger was a mad genius bent on anarchy and Jared Leto was just a madman with make-up on and very forgettable. I liked the Squad. They were a group of which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. I even liked their controller. Spruce up the antagonists, lose the Joker (leave him for the Batman movies) and make Harley Quinn more useful than for eye candy and the movie is a lot better.",Suicide Squad
26,neil-476,Nowhere near as bad as made out,7,23 May 2018,"In a world devastated by the death of Superman, and still getting used to the threats posed by metahumans, scheming Amanda Waller brings together a group of criminals with ""gifts"" to be used on deniable operations: force them into working as a covert task force, and throw them under the bus if things go wrong.Suicide Squad continues the expansion of DC's cinematic universe into the darkness established by Man Of Steel and Batman v Superman: arguably the Squad is a more appropriate vehicle for this direction than DC's flagship Big Blue Boyscout (SPOILER: he's dead now, anyway, his funeral featuring briefly in the opening minutes of SS). Paradoxically, SS is somewhat lighter than Snyder's two Superman movies, although I emphasise that ""somewhat"" actually means ""not much.""This film has been critically mauled, but it's nowhere near as bad as has been made out. Dark, certainly, but this is a group of murderous criminals, so you shouldn't expect a super-powered version of the A-Team - these aren't nice people. Having said that, Will Smith's Deadshot is a murdering hitman with a young daughter he dotes on, thus making him a morally compromised bloke you can identify with. And Margot Robbie, the sexiest thing on screen this year so far, IS Harley Quinn. They gave us (blink and you'll miss it) Alex Ross' Mad Love cover - thank you!Unfortunately, the rest of the Squad don't do so well. They all get origins and moments in the spotlight during combat, but there is precious little for them in terms of character and backstory. Consequently it is difficult to care much about them, and the film lacks heart as a result.But there's bags of action, a decent threat, and one really good scene where they take a timeout in a deserted bar, and we get some idea of what the inter-relationships and dynamics of the group might have been had the script spent more time on character and less on expending ordnance aka blowing crap up. DC still hasn't figured out why the Marvel cinematic movies are so successful: we care about the characters. Here - not so much.Overall, though, I enjoyed this. I have recently been reading John Ostrander's original run writing the Suicide Squad comic in the 80s, and this film is at least as good as that.Don't bother with a 3D viewing - it adds nothing.",Suicide Squad

Recently learning that she has been catching up on Will Smith's old movies on Netflix UK,I decided to get her Smith's most recent blockbuster,which led to me joining the Suicide Squad.
View on the film:Gathering up a group of Punk outcasts,the screenplay by writer/director David Ayer pulls the strings down on the unique elements of each Squad member,to instead trap them in a vague race against time adventure,with the bare minimum of Comic-Book pulp.With the studio not building a background to the Squad in solo flicks,Ayer spends the opening on the origins back to back,which ends up making them each just feel like another cog in the franchise.Whilst the soundtracks strays on the misjudged,director Ayer & cinematographer Roman Vasyanov display the pulp comic/animated roots of the characters in an eye-catching fashion of grubby spandex,from Harley Quinn's naughty,but nice suggestive costume,to the mighty roar of Killer Croc.Extensively re-filmed, Ayer makes the production issues all too visible,as would-be action set-pieces are covered in a dark blue which adds to the vagueness of the mission,and saturated coloured flashbacks are randomly chucked in,that feel like a last ditch shot at giving the gang members some background.Going ""method"" for the movie, Jared Leto makes his Joker be a street ""gangsta"",whose silver gums and tattoos are symbols of his street cred,and not a psychological component to the character.Joined by a welcomed,wise-cracking Will Smith as Deadshot, sexy Margot Robbie steals the movie with a baseball bat attack as Harley Quinn,with Robbie tangling the dangerously playful Punk wild card edge of Quinn,with an underlying,quick-witted side of making sure the Suicide Squad don't join the suicide club.",Suicide Squad
28,anaconda-40658,Harley Quinn.,5,9 September 2016,"Suicide Squad (2016): Dir: David Ayer / Cast: Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Jay Hernandez, Cara Delevingne: High anticipated disappointment that centres around a group of super villains whose lifestyle summon various powers without thought of consequence. They are assembled together to prevent what is perceived as a terrorist attack until common sense sets in. Jared Leto is given the near impossible task of playing the Joker whose boots were filled twice successfully, but not so here. Leto's manic laugh is off and he seems only placed for back story involving Harley Quinn, his former psychiatrist turned criminal. She is played by Margot Robbie who steals the entire film with her wicked comedic demeanor that laughs in the face of consequence. Will Smith plays Deadshot whose aim is perfect but lifestyle conflicts with the love of his daughter. Jay Hernandez plays the remorseful El Diablo, former gang member who can summon fire. His face is tattooed but his soul is pained with memories of family tragedy. Carla Delevingne plays Dr. June Moone who becomes Enchantress. She is under romantic watch of Colonel Rick Flag who is conflicted between his love for June and the distain for the monster she becomes. Should be special but instead the screenplay is a jumbled mess throwing in one fight scene after another. Director David Ayer previously made End of Watch and Fury.

29,FlashCallahan,"Batsy, Batsy, Batsy..........",10,5 August 2016,"There have been films that have been divisive for all the right reasons. Last year, The Visit split audiences and critics alike right down the middle into the quality of the film. But there were the people whom already gave the film the brush of because of the director.Now we have Suicide Squad, and it's pretty much the same for this film, but because of some people's views of BVS, many have already dismissed this because it's D.C., and nothing can touch Marvel, or the legacy Ledger left with his portrayal.Haters gonna hate......a team of incarcerated villains, including Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, and Deadshot, are recruited by the government for a suicide mission in exchange for clemency. Their assignment, however, is complicated by the ongoing quest of the Joker to reunite with his one true love......I'll get straight to the point. The film is stupendously entertaining, it's bright, colourful, devoid of any sort of relevant story, put goes along at such a heady pace, full of wonderful characters, couldn't care less. This is Suicide Squad, The Con Air of comic book movies.The film is split into three. The first part is the back stories and introductions to the squad, and they are each unique to their characters, but do give a little away to how their individuality will affect their actions. Smith for example is easily the most humanistic of the titular group, and it's no surprise as to how his character progresses through the film. Dead shot is a contract killer, not a psychotic killer, thief, or your atypical 'bad guy'. He has a daughter for crying out loud, that should spell everything out.Harley Quinn is good, but she runs out of steam toward the end of the third act. She's amazing to look at, but her little tics and one liners start to grate toward the end, but her story with The Joker is ironically the most interesting thing of the first act.The rest of the characters introductions are a lot shorter bar Enchantress, which has a The Decent vibe to it, but you never get bored of the introductions, eve if it does take a good 30mins of the film up.The second act is heavily influenced by Carpenters Escape From New York, it's them in a desolate place, with their lives at stake, and what pretty much feels like a no win situation, just lake Snake Plisskin had all them years ago. This is where the bad guys and the good guys start to get a little bit of a mutual respect for each other, thanks to the relationship between Smith and Kinnerman, their banter is excellent, and the second act is as action packed and as funny as you'd expect, with The Jokers shadow hanging heavily over the narrative.The third act is very reminiscent of the final act of the original Ghostbusters, and this is where the majority of the Squad come into their own, especially Diablo, played brilliantly by Hernandez.And for once, the trailers haven't given anything about the narrative away, the actual story, as flimsy as it is is pretty surprising, as I thought it was centred around Leto's Joker.Leto, is honestly wonderful as the Joker, and although his screen time is limited, it's the characters shadow that keeps him in the back of your mind for the film.Courtney doesn't do much as Boomerang other than drink beer and play with his unicorn, and the inclusion of Katana is a pointless exercise.But all in all, it's a wonderful creation, frenetic, funny, scary, and well justified of its 15 rating here in the U.K.Ignore the critics and the haters, Suicide Squad, while light on plot, is top notch summer entertainment, and one of the most enjoyable things D.C has released yet.Like Smith said to Viola Davis (who is the scariest thing in the film) 'that's gangster'.......",Suicide Squad
30,Aaron1375,"In some bizarre way, this film just clicked for me...",9,8 August 2016,"I had heard that the reviews for this film were less than stellar so I was not sure what to expect. The reviews for Batman V Superman were not so good either, but I enjoyed that one and I am happy to say I enjoyed this one too. In fact, I thought it was more enjoyable than Batman V Superman. I cannot explain why, but it just really worked for me for some completely unknown and strange reason. Perhaps, it simply worked well with the myriad of mental issues I have and it blended well to form some sort of connection with my warped brain. I just do not know, but I am glad I enjoyed it as I took a gamble to see it in theaters and I would hate to shell out money for tickets and not like it. Not only did I like it, but the other two people I was with enjoyed it as well. It was not without its problems, which is why I give it a nine rather than a ten, but most of the issues are in the opening portion of the film. Once the squad is together and in the field the movie is off and running and it is nearly nonstop action the rest of the way.The story starts out with a woman with a plan to bring together a team of meta humans and those with special skills to combat any threat from a superhuman. Basically, it picks up where Batman V Superman left off and Superman is dead so not only is he not around anymore there is always the chance that another like him turns up and perhaps this one will not be as friendly. Well, we are introduced to the candidates who are criminals for the most part. There is Deadshot, an assassin for hire, Harley Quinn the Joker's insane partner in crime, Killer Croc, Diablo master of flames, Boomerang and a mysterious woman who is possessed by a being known as the Enchantress. Well that last one turns out to be a huge mistake as she releases her brother and together they hatch a plan to take over the world. The team of criminals are assembled and forced to help a special teams unit as in Escape From New York and are led by Rick Flagg who is joined by a girl named Katana. They must enter the city and retrieve someone important, but the Joker is tracking their movements as he tries to take Harley back!The actors and actresses all do a good job. I especially enjoyed Will Smith's Deadshot as he is probably one of the few people that can make an assassin for hire a sympathetic character. I also enjoyed Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. A lot of people have been complaining about the amount of screen time Jared Leto's Joker received, but I thought how was presented worked as he is not a member of the team, he is just someone trying to get his girlfriend back and does so in strange ways. He was almost like Micheal Keaton as Beetlejuice, not really in the film for very long, but he made an impact any time he was on screen. The main problem I had with the film was the first portion of the film as it was at times, a bit hard to follow. The characters are introduced, but then it flashes here and there; however, this stops once the team is dispatched and after that it is almost all action the rest of the way.So it was not a perfect film and from all the negative reviews it is not going to be a beloved film by everyone. That being said I really enjoyed it. The music clicked for me, the characters clicked for me and the action was great and kept me entertained. That is all I can ask for. It also sets up next year's Justice League film which I saw a trailer for and it sadly had almost the same amount of humor in it than the entirety of Batman V Superman. The trailer was like two minutes long so that should say something. This film, too, had some more comedy and at the same time dark so it melded really well. I would love to see these characters turn up again in another Suicide Squad film or in other films in the DC movie universe as they really made the film work for me.",Suicide Squad
31,trashgang,the story wasn't that strong and Harley's jokes weren't funny,7,6 September 2016,"There you have it, over here another would be summer blockbuster like Independence Day but both flopped completely. It's strange because you can't deny the fact that flicks about superheroes are a big hit nowadays. But after the controversial Batman vs Superman (2016) I'm left again with a bitter feeling.I remember more then a year ago when rumours came that there was going to be a Suicide Squad flick. Soon pictures and trailers appeared and it looked all stunning. And the testoterone with so many teenagers was growing with the first view of Harley Quinn with her tiny short. But a short or sexy outfits doesn't make a movie. It's not all that bad but for me the jokes offered by Harley Quinn didn't work at all and when you got a problem with a main lead be sure that the flick fails. But it's not all her fault, it's the story itself that didn't got my by my throat. I have seen the Batman fighting Superlan twice and still it isn't my flick. Guess I have the same feeling with this one. In the beginning and at the end, Batman do appears (Ben Afflick) to make it all believable and Jared Leto is excellent as The Joker but we will never see a Joker like Heath Ledger again. Better then the stupid Independence Day, stronger story for sure but sadly after more then a year waiting Suicide Squad couldn't convince me.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Suicide Squad
32,deloudelouvain,This time the villains become heroes,7,17 January 2017,I am normally not a big fan of super heroes. It's always the same and it gets boring after a while. This time you get the villains to be the heroes by saving the earth from another villain. It's a bit different but still you get the feeling that you saw it all before. The action is good though. And that is the only thing that counts in movies like that. To me the best villain to look at was Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie. She has a touch of humor that does the story good. Otherwise don't expect too much of the movie or the story. Like I said it's all been done before. But for an evening of just relaxing watching some action scenes it's an okay movie. There are way worse movies then this one.,Suicide Squad

And that's as humorous as I can be about this. You don't have to be a fanboy to see that the approach was all wrong; to the characters, the tone, even the soundtrack.

34,siderite,Beyond salvation,6,7 October 2016,"This film has the coolest villain entry I've seen in a long while. The scenes with Enchantress taking over her host body and the tentacle attacks of her brother in the very beginning were absolutely breathtaking. As was Margot Robbie's cute behind. Unfortunately, everything else was really really stupid.The thing is that there was the possibility to make this work, but somehow it turned into a badly edited amalgamation of ideas that don't belong together. What was Harley Quinn doing there? How did she further the story in any way? If you eliminate her, you don't need The Joker. Remove completely pointless characters like Katana and Boomerang and you had time for storytelling and character development and amazing action.But no, they had to dump all possible characters in this thing: Batman, Joker, Harley, Katana, Captain Boomerang, Diablo, Killer Croc. Killer Croc was a joke! Because of the heavy makeup you couldn't even recognize Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje even when you knew he was the actor and you could barely understand what he was saying.Plagued by indecision, the studios managed to completely mangle this movie, even if they let it all fall on the head of the guy who appears as both director and writer. From the cast you would think poor David Ayer was solely responsible for the entire film. In fact it's an army of IP lawyers and some money desperate people who are just as pointless as the characters they push down our throats. Bottom line: I can't imagine any way in which this production could have been saved by reshoots or reediting, it's that much of a mess. And it's infuriating because the potential and the people were all there! Will Smith was good, but I felt he was not the right man for the character.",Suicide Squad
35,namashi_1,A Disappointment!,5,7 August 2016,"Based on the DC Comics antihero team of the same name, 'Suicide Squad' comes with BIG hype & expectations, but sadly, this superhero flick lacks the bite. No, its not as lifeless as Batman v Superman, its much better than that, but overall, the zing & the madness are missing here. It has merit, but not enough to camouflage its flaws.'Suicide Squad' Synopsis: A secret government agency recruits a group of imprisoned super-villains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency, which inevitably leads to chaos.'Suicide Squad' begins awesomely & the antiheroes are introduced with style & flair. But as soon as antiheroes step out into the city to stop havoc, the film just falls flat. Thats mainly because the film doesn't do much with its characters. The supposed ""Worst Heroes EVER"" (as promoted in its posters), are reduced into normal heroic tools, who indulge in ultraviolet confrontations with the opposing rival. Oh and coming to their rivals, The Enchantress, is a weak antagonist, who doesn't emerge powerful or intimidating enough. Also, why is the Legendary Joker reduced into a cameo? The Joker isn't a part of the 'Suicide Squad', in fact, he appears as a minor sub-plot for Harley Quinn, whom he's out to save amongst the violent state.David Ayer's Writing & Direction weaken 'Suicide Squad'. Though Ayer succeeds in making the film look comic-bookish & begins the film with on a really strong note, his Writing stagnates after a point. As mentioned before, the characters remain underused & there is a sense of potential being shun away. Ayer's Writing needed to be far stronger. His Direction, on the other-hand, is fine at places, but isn't consistent, as the pacing shifts as does the narrative. Roman Vasyanov's Cinematography is decent. John Gilroy's Editing is alright. Graphics are fantastic & so are the Action-Sequences. Steven Price's Score is excellent. Art & Costume Design are top-notch. Make-Up deserves a special mention.Performance-Wise: 'Suicide Squad' has a huge ensemble cast, but its Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn, who steals the show completely. Robbie is absolutely sensational as the whacked-out yet sexy & unpredictable Harley Quinn, who's romance for The Joker appears real. The terrific actress owns the screen, each time she appears on. Following her up in a surprisingly short & under-written role, Jared Leto puts up an impressive portrayal of The Joker. Comparing him to the Mighty Jack Nicholson or the Late/Great Heath Ledger, wouldn't be fair, as he's barely given much time here & he's not giving the same personality, this is a very gangster version of The Joker. But, overall, he can surely be looked forward too in another, bigger role of the legendary villain. Will Smith as Floyd Lawton / Deadshot, plays it right, & its good to see him loosen up a little. Jai Courtney as Digger Harkness / Captain Boomerang, gets limited scope, but he does well. Jay Hernandez as Chato Santana / El Diablo is barely there, while Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Waylon Jones / Killer Croc, who's completely under make-up and graphics, is wasted. Cara Delevingne as Dr. June Moone / Enchantress, doesn't work. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, is alright. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, is authoritative, as always. Ben Affleck returns as Batman for a cameo & he looks the part even more now. Others lend support.On the whole, 'Suicide Squad' disappoints, despite a few pluses.",Suicide Squad

And this picture is different and unique as anytime you have the villains and the bay guys shining and doing the dirty work it's a showcase, really it's wild, wicked, and fun chaos! The plot is pretty simple Amanda Waller(Viola Davis)heads up a secret government agency and all of a sudden a black ops mission has come up. And the plan is to get a group of super villains to come out of prison and help with the mission, for in return an exchange for all reduced sentences! Yet the job is fun, wild, wicked, and crazy, to watch the bad boys and oh yes bad girl(Harley Quinn)mop up and do the dirty work is pure pleasure! The film has plenty of action and the super villains most remembered are Deadshot(Will Smith)a guy who's lethal with a bullet and the beast and monster of the underground Gotham sewer Killer Croc is a fright of a joy to watch. And the best eye candy treat is the watching of Harley Quinn(in a sexy performance from Margot Robbie)who's a devious girl who swings hard with the big boys and in a subplot her romance with ""The Joker""(Jared Leto)entertains and spices the film it's like a little extra icing on the cake. Overall this D.C. film is different still it's fun watching the bad guys work as deep down they feel some guilt and dream of a normal better life before facing the real picture, ""Suicide Squad"" blends raw aggressive sex appeal with Harley Quinn and the use of ""The Joker"" is somewhat of a wild card still it's a good look at the other side of the D.C. universe that exist showing the different way of life that many live.",Suicide Squad
37,DKosty123,Fun Summer Drive In Flick,7,13 August 2016,"D.C. Comics is the premise for this, but in putting this 2 hours together WB came up with a film that flows with action most of the way through. I kind of expected this movie might get an ""R"" rating, but they have toned down the action and violence to make it PG. Even the language is tame compared to many films of this type.Because of the replacement of the mature stuff with the action and fluff, this turns into a movie you can take most of the kids too and confuse the heck out of them. Most kids would not like real anti- heroes but this movie sanitizes them enough that the action is the dominating factor to the film.With the exception of the premise of assembling bad people to do what good people need to do but can't, the movie breaks little new ground. That is because we do the the Hollywood Good Feeling PG ending. That is not all bad.The squad is formed by a Government Agency, and a mysterious type of witch and her brother are the evil that the team is forced to face. That sort of sums up the plot. There are a lot of interaction scenes between the Suicide Squad which dominates the jokes and punchlines categories. Will Smith gets the majority of the better punch lines, but there are plenty to go around. Margo Robbie (Harley Quinn) gets to talk, maybe too much, and gets some play off Deadshot (Smith) and most of the team. She gets to make out with boyfriend Joker (Jared Leto) and their relationship is possibly the most major sub-plot of the movie.Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) plays her role as the top government official in charge of the Suicide Squad much like Judi Dench's M in the Bond 007 films. This is not a bad thing as her role is one of the few roles played seriously. Granted this is not a fair comparison as the 007 scripts are generally a bit better than this film.Spoiler - during the awesome graphic credits, there is a clip which appears to very much hint at the next film getting spun from this one which I bet is already in the works.",Suicide Squad
38,lasttimeisaw,a superhero mix-bag fatigue,6,23 August 2016,"SUICIDE SQUAD, conspicuously hits a nadir in its feedback from critics, which officially raise the curtain of the battle-of-wits between DC franchises and carping pundits, perhaps it will be wiser for their next projects to skip the early critics screenings, if their claim of those films are made for die-hard comic books fans is sincere, who cares about critics then? The only problem is, the die-hard fanbase alone cannot cough up enough doughs to cover its hefty production budget, and since it is all about money, one might expect some sea change will soon befall from their grandee decision makers.This time, one must concur with the critics, maybe in light of a seriousness-bucking freshness wrought by Marvel's DEADPOOL (2016) into the ever-blasé superhero glut earlier this year, audience's surged expectancy towards SUICIDE SQUAD has reached a threshold of inevitable ricochet. There is something frustratingly by-the-numbers in this supposedly paradigm-shifting entertaining fare where a ragtag cluster of characteristic antiheroes are reluctantly mustered together - in this case, a bomb is implanted in their neck, which can be detonate by Colonel Red Flag (Kinnaman, looks impeccably high-minded, ) if they rebel or try to escape -, to work for the US government and save the world from an impending doom from a sorceress-deity Enchantress (Delevingne).Top hit-man Deadshot (Smith) and former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Robbie) are among the expendables who predictably get the star treatment with a more generous story arc and screen- time, but Smith doesn't comes off so much a merciless mercenary than a traditionally valued family man who solely happens to be a marksman. As for Robbie, the current ""it"" girl in Hollywood, her over-merchandised impersonation of Quinn's bi-polar bearings patently stands out among the assembly, not because she is phenomenal, only the competition isn't challenging enough. Yet, the biggest disappointment is Jared Leto's Joker, short-changed in screen-time notwithstanding, his pompous performance is hammy to high heaven, menace and romantic vibes between Joker and Harley Quinn are both in dire dearth. Courtney's Captain Boomerang is the only member who betrays a whiff of unpredictability in his veins, whereas a penitent Diablo (Hernandez), being the only one who actually is bestowed with super power amongst the squad, follows a stock plot device, awakes from his shell of self-punishment (for his own sins) to embrace his power to battle the evil.A stony-faced Viola Davis plays Amanda Walker, a government agent abides by her own gray-area philosophy and wantonly overstays her welcome, and a long-standing villain problem in the superhero assembly-line doesn't ameliorate at all, numberless and faceless minions are basically weapon-less moving targets to boost the gang's close-combat dexterity, and motivation-aside, is Enchantress's swaggering portal-opening parade a blatant homage to the original GHOSTBUSTERS (1984)? Also the inundating score from Steven Price during the heightened battle is insufferable. Concisely, SUICIDE SQUAD is unintelligently oscillating between a costly cult caterer and a pulpy mainstream appeaser, and as it often turns out, it fial to reach both sides.",Suicide Squad

40,KineticSeoul,"""Assault on Arkham"" is still the better movie",6,8 October 2016,"Like most people, I was actually hyped for this film. Mainly because of the trailers, but then again most movies that had good trailers was disappointing this year. The film starts off with flare, especially with the introduction of each Suicide Squad members. But when they actually go on the main mission, things start to go downhill from there. It isn't a terrible movie, but it just isn't that stand out. With David Ayer previous films, he just seemed like the right director for the job when it came to this film. But the problem was David Ayer only had a short time to come up with a script for this because the studio basically rushed the guy. They basically gave him six weeks to write the script which is very short to write a coherent story with development and creativity. And that is what this movie lacked, which is creativity and development. No wonder why they went for the re-shoots, because instead of just going in the gritty direction the studio wanted it to be more fun and punk like. Mainly because the Bohemian Rhapsody trailer was very well received by the viewers and critics. And maybe because of the success of the ""Deadpool"" movie. Anyways when the crew go on the main mission, it's just bland action with bunch of special effects with the team going in a very narrow direction. There just wasn't enough development for the characters and creative teamwork scenarios. Jared Leto was ticked off because most of his Joker scenes got deleted from the theatrical release. But I could see why, because it wouldn't work when it comes to the total context of the plot. The title is ""Suicide Squad"" after all. There is just one action scene that stood out to me and that was when Deadshot played by Will Smith goes ballistic by accurately shooting his bullets at the mutated enemies. However another thing that stood out to me, is the darkness and pain within each of the group members hearts. Such as guilt, emotional scars, longing for redemption and longing for family and love. So although the Suicide Group members maybe the bad guys that did bad things but they ain't evil. So the missions is about bad vs. evil and I thought that was a cool premise although the direction was poorly constructed. If you want to watch a better Suicide Squad movie that has more believable character depth with the members actually seeming like the bad guys. Doing bad guy stuff while being forced into a mission by Amanda Waller check out ""Batman: Assault on Arkham"". In this one the transition between bad guys acting like the good guys was too drastic and the interactions between the characters just didn't give off that vibe of bad guys talking with one another. Overall, it's another forgettable watchable flick. Which is a shame because the characters seemed so interesting and it just came off as a missed opportunity. Oh well, hopefully the sequel will have these underdeveloped areas fixed and make it a more immersive and creative experience.6.5/10",Suicide Squad
41,Hellmant,An extended director's cut would make it nearly perfect!,10,9 August 2016,"'SUICIDE SQUAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)The highly anticipated superhero flick, based on the DC comics antihero team (of the same name). It's also the third movie in the DC Extended Universe film franchise (following 'MAN OF STEEL' and 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'), and Ben Affleck even reprises his role as Batman in it. The film stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Jared Leto, Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Karen Fukuhara, Cara Delevingne, Ike Barinholtz and Scott Eastwood. It was written and directed by David Ayer. The story revolves around an unlikely team of formerly imprisoned supervillains, that are recruited by a secret government agency; to go on a special black ops mission to save the world. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics, but (most) fans of the comic book insist it's a masterpiece. I absolutely loved it! The story focuses around a government program, conceived and executed by U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Davis), in which imprisoned dangerous criminals are selected to be a part of a special black ops team. They're promised a reward of clemency, if they succeed; and threatened with immediate execution, if they try to escape. They're mission is to stop a powerful mystic force, and it's lethal army. The 'bad guys' that make up the team, surprisingly bond in the process.The movie is undeniably fun! It's dark, violent, and sometimes quite disturbing (much like 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'); but it's also hilarious, and highly entertaining. There's some really interesting character development (throughout), and the performances are outstanding (especially Robbie and Leto). The action scenes are kind of by-the-numbers, but they're also involving (because the characters are so likable). My only real compliant with the film, is that's it's too quickly edited; probably due to studio demands (to make the movie shorter and faster-paced). I'm sure an extended director's cut would make it nearly perfect (like the extended cut of 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN')!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264",Suicide Squad
42,thesar-2,I Now Have Suicidal Tendencies. Thanks.,2,6 August 2016,"Many years ago, the characters, Jack and Karen, from TV's Will & Grace, jokingly agreed with audiences (including me) that the show should've been about them. THIS movie should've just been about Joker and Harley. Those two in a movie filled with lifeless, useless and boring characters *almost* serves as a recommendation. But, when all you have is two wonderful villains in a sea of misfires that should've been at least cool, it's too much of a letdown film to spread good word-of-mouth.And the lack of a fun time you would've had with a bunch of misfits gone good is nothing in comparison to how bad the script was. The whole movie was so far all over the place, it always felt like there was another movie with an extra hour of footage that was cut out making the overall picture a completely incomprehensible mess. Suicide Squad's own premise makes no sense whatsoever, just to begin with. After (too) many flashbacks and backstories that also continue throughout the film, a plan is hatched to use the vilest baddies to, um, uh, I guess help keep people safe? All-but midstream of the planning stages, a mission so convoluted gets the ""we won't sign on"" team ready to go fightwhatever.In one of the many subplots, a slave to the ""good-guys"" causes Man of Steel-sized havoc in a downtown city. Superheroes are mentioned, used and are actively fighting crime, and yet Never was there a thought of asking for help, nor did the actual righteous heroes even notice the city under attack or hundreds dying. Yeah, this is the same argument in the Marvel Universe, such as: In Thor's movies, where's Iron Man when he's totally needed. That's a huge hole in both Marvel and DC Universe films and I guess they just ask us to accept it. Whatever.The movie had pretty subpar special effects and nothing to view on the big screen. The actors kept trying to give emotional speeches but always strayed away from their character build-ups. And the plot holes and editing was so shoddy, it lead me to believe this wasn't the movie we were supposed to see.Again, that all said, man did I like Harley and this version of Joker. I've heard complaints about Jared Leto's take and I didn't have one problem with it. I've seen so many incarnations of him, I'm used to new visions of ""J."" From Cesar Romero's to Jack Nicholson's to my person favorite, Heath Ledger's, The Joker has many faces and motivations. So, I was cool with him.Overall, with Joker and the absolutely fabulous Harley Quinn, the movie barely squeaks to a star over the lowest rating. MAYBE, you can watch this at home, for free, like on Netflix or a free Redbox rental, but only to see them. Everything else is incidental. And bad.***Final thoughts: Shame on you DC. Sadly, there's a post-credit scene (NOT A FAN) and it's a hundred percent rip-off of the Marvel film's post- credit scenes. Almost verbatim. Not to mention, it's something we already know about, so it was pointless. IF you see this movie, you can stay through the first part of the end credits to see this, but be warned: It's just melted icing on an already spoiled cake.",Suicide Squad
43,bensonmum2,"""Puddin'!""",4,28 November 2017,"In the aftermath of the events played out in Batman v Superman, some in the government are concerned about handling the next meta-human crises the world might face. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) puts together a team of super criminals, each with their own unique power/talents to deal with such a threat. The newly formed Suicide Squad is called in to action almost immediately when one of Waller's recruits turns and threatens to destroy the world. When I first caught wind of Suicide Squad, I was excited. My excitement started to wane as I read more and more about the movie. By the time it hit theaters and I read the initial reviews, I decided to wait to watch it. I finally sat down with it last night. And while it's not as bad as some would have you believe (I mean a 1/10 is an absolutely ridiculous rating for this movie), overall, it's a bloated mess of a film. The end result is a mostly unentertaining and quite often boring film. A lot of the problems with Suicide Squad could have been remedied with some judicious editing, a more streamlined cast, and baddies with better defined purpose. Editing - There are many useless moments in the film that seem to exist only to extend the film's ridiculously long runtime. For example (and I could cite dozens), right out of the gate, Waller is involved in two separate meetings to discuss the possibility of forming the Suicide Squad. Why not one? Why did we need to see her make her case twice? Totally unnecessary. Cast - The cast is far too large. Some of the characters are unnecessary to the film. Why include them? The Suicide Squad could have easily consisted of Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and El Diablo. Characters like Captain Boomerang, Katana, Slipknot (why bother with him in the first place), Killer Croc and even Joker (yes, even Joker), could have been eliminated without changing a whole lot of the film. All these characters only serve to take up screen time, confuse the issue, and extend the film's runtime. I'm thankful they weren't all given the same detailed backstories like Deadshot and Harley - otherwise, this would have been a 3+ hour movie.Baddies - The baddies, Enchantress and her brother, are so poorly defined that I still have no idea what they were up to. I know they were trying to destroy the world, but why? What was their endgame? Maybe it's explained, but if it is, it's not explained very well. How about a baddie with a real plan? If you really want Joker in the movie, make him the baddie. The conflict Harley would have been forced to go through would have made for a better movie than this.Those are my three main points, but there are more I could get into if I wanted, like: bad CGI, some ridiculous dialogue, the gooey minions that reminded me of a Power Ranger's villain (and were about as threatening), and a soundtrack that, though it includes some great songs, got annoying real quick. All of these negatives overshadow any fun that might have been in the script and the solid performances from Viola Davis, Margo Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, and Jay Hernandez. In the end, I consider Suicide Squad a wasted opportunity for DC to bring in some new fans. The original idea and the trailers promised so much more than was actually delivered. I'm rating this one a very disappointing, but generous, 4/10.",Suicide Squad
44,FeastMode,my notes,3,30 June 2019,"Where was the evil-ness????? even the intro credits had heroic music. i wish it had a more evil tone.overall this was a bad movie. bad story, horrible pacing, bloated with needless characters. bad choppy directing. it also tried to add some humor and most of it not only didn't work, but felt very forced, awkward and out of place. some of the jokes were also very lame and cringe-worthy. i like when superhero movies have good comedy like most of the MCU movies, but it really isn't necessary. And I think they did reshoots where they added some of those comedic scenes, and a few times it really seemed like something was just added in the middle of the scene that didn't fit. i also thought the villain was forgettable. she was cool at times but really she was pretty weak (figuratively)there were so many useless characters, actually most of them. i really only liked the joker, harley quinn and deadshot. i loved harley quinn and i wanted to see more of her (figuratively). her character is very intriguing, evil and funny at the same time. jared leto had an interesting take on the joker, which i liked for the most part. he felt intimidating and psychotic in certain scenes. the problem was he was barely in the movie. also, his introduction was non-existent. we are seeing a new actor play the biggest Batman villain, there should have been a build up or some anticipation when we are about to see him for the first time. but they just cut to a scene with him talking to Harley at a table. such a wasted opportunity. for reference, remember the introduction to the joker in the dark knight? that was AMAZING and unforgettable.the other really disappointing thing is that the action was very useless. coming out of the movie i can't think of one action scene that stood out. they had a few cool slow motion moments but creative action was non-existent. after watching it a second time, i conclude that none of the action in this movie is good. it is horrible. i could pick 100 action scenes from the different marvel movies that are better than any scene in here. and that's not an exaggeration. i wanted to see them work together. but they didn't work together at all, in a sense of using each other's skills in combination, etc. the only used actual teamwork one time in the entire movie.i was really into the first 30 minutes-ish of this movie. there were lots of cool scenes and i liked learning who the characters were and what they were about. but then they kept adding more characters as the movie went on, new characters i had no interest in, while also taking up any time the original characters would have had to be developed. and some of the lines in this movie are laughable. there are a lot of questionable parts and things you can make fun of for not making sense. this movie was a huge disappointment. i could have fallen in love if it was done right.at least this movie gave me a new awesome song: Heathens by Twenty One Pilots. good for you, movie.

SPOILERS
the end battle with the huge world destruction is becoming a very typical of DC movies. it's like a normal thing now. the funny thing is, it's so commonplace that they actually had a montage of world destruction not even halfway through the movie. as if the city getting destroyed isn't a big thing any more, let's just sum it up really quick with some good music.something that really bothered me is one of many scenes that were choppy. flag takes june to her brother, they don't say why but i think everyone assumes she's there to stop him. it then immediately cuts to him saying she bolted. wasn't sure why that happened. and even thought it was ""explained"" later, it still could have been done better. the real problem comes later in the movie with the ""reveal"" of what really happened. but the only real difference is that they showed a bomb they were going to use to kill the brother. everything else was basically the same so they didn't really tell us anything new. so why replay all those scenes again as if we need to understand what really happened. when they started showing it again i was excited to see what really happened but it was nothing. smhso many times they show the enchantress destroying stuff across the world, satelites in space and around america using completely destructive beams. but then she fights her enemies with swords and fists. so many things like this make no sense. the mind control stuff was such a weak attempt. and the way they kill the big dude and end the final battle is so lame. basically just explode it. so why couldn't that be done in a million other ways. it was never mentioned that they need to get close to blow it up. and to kill the enchantress, they basically just tricked her cause she's really dumb. pretend to be on her side for 5 seconds then slice her while saying one of the worst lines in the movie: ""There's just one teeny problem, you messed with my friends."" Heart slice, game over....... lame over. omg and let's not forget the laughable scene when the black chick kills all of her innocent employees. lolololol. i just convinced myself to drop it from 2.5 to 1.5. I was only gonna go down to 2.0 but there is just too much bad and very little good in this moviethe batman cameo was exciting.",Suicide Squad
45,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Flashy but lifeless DC Comics adaptation,2,1 June 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The Earth is under attack from an intergalactic life force that wants to take over. Government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) suggests an unlikely idea: to battle with such a deadly and unfair force, they must assemble a team of super villains who play by their own rules, including assassin Deadshot (Will Smith), super minx Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and her lover The Joker (Jared Leto), and release them from prison to take down the threat. This, of course, does not go entirely to plan, and as well as dealing with the force, they must also rescue Doctor Jane Moone (Cara Delevinge) from the clutches of the Enchantress, an evil entity that has taken over her.While Marvel certainly seems to hold the reigns over the superhero movie franchise, DC Comics are more than capable of flashing their weight, with a number of glossy big screen adaptations of their most popular characters, where their virtuous, emboldened personas are projected into the product to heightened effect. With Suicide Squad, director David Ayer has attempted to flip this on its head, and instead give us a group of anti heroes with attitude and much less moral fibre. It's definitely a colourful, flashy piece, but sadly, the end result is just a complete mess.It's going for a loud, funky style, yet it's shot in a surprisingly grey and dour manner throughout, like it's trying to capture the spirit of the righteous comic book adaptations it was selling itself as the antidote to. Yet the worst thing is just the complete lack of any discernible, coherent plot to keep you interested. The complete premise seems to be sold on what would happen if a bunch of bad guys were sent to battle a super-threat, but this is not a strong enough foundation on which to set up a film in itself, and it shows.Performances wise, Smith virtually plays the wise-cracking wise-ass in his sleep, yet he still feels unsuited and misplaced playing an all out villain as opposed to just a maverick good guy, while as one of the main villains, Delevinge is just a terrible actress and should really just go back to the catwalk. Leto's Joker is certainly different, but not much of an impression otherwise. Robbie's sassy Harley Quinn is probably the best thing about it.Just a big, colourful, garish mess, really, and a wasted opportunity. *",Suicide Squad
46,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It may not be as long as 'Batman V Superman (2016)', but it's certainly much harder to sit through.",3,7 August 2016,"The most notable issue with 'Suicide Squad (2016)' is the absolutely egregious editing, both its moment-to-moment stuff that's rife with jarring (and, almost certainly, unintentional) jump cuts and its long-form assembly of scenes which are unfocused and jumbled past all semblance of structure. It breaks a number of fundamental principles to the point that it is, at times, literally difficult to watch. As such, the piece becomes a confusingly chaotic clip-show that doesn't afford enough time to any one particular moment for a rudimentary connection to occur between audience and character, never mind an empathetic one. This hyperactive attitude carries across all aspects of the flick's frenzied production, from the eclectic yet skittish soundtrack seemingly dictated by a toddler twiddling with the family radio to the needlessly nervous narrative so intent on not picking a protagonist or sticking to a consistent tone that it's actually almost admirable. This is especially evident in the borderline unwatchable first hour, which feels like it has been out-sourced, gutted and haphazardly stitched back in in order to quote unquote 'fix' the apparent issues brewing with the flick (which is apparently what happened in an effort to avoid the downbeat tone of 'Batman V Superman (2016)'). All this 'fixing' simply results in around a mega-tonne of needless exposition and a cluttered, unfocused mess of a so-called story. Though the second half thankfully moves away from this anxiety-inducing agitation (in that it isn't as incompetently constructed or incoherently conceived) by focusing on the more traditional and generic side of things, even this segment is only passably passively entertaining as it's still the most schlocky, underdeveloped and intangibly dull trite you could possibly imagine. It may not be as long as its predecessor, but it's certainly much harder to sit through. 3/10NOTE: This is a revised version of my previously submitted review as, after re-watching the film, my opinion of the piece has quite drastically changed.",Suicide Squad
47,bowmanblue,Bad guys have all the fun,8,11 August 2016,"'Suicide Squad' is one of those films that's surrounded by 'filmic politics' before you ever enter the theatre. You have the fact that it's based on a comic therefore there is an army of fans who are ready to pick apart how their favourite bad-guys are portrayed on screen. Plus it's part of DC Comics' attempt at playing catch-up to Marvel by creating their own shared universe. Then you have it as a – loose – sequel to Batman vs Superman, which is a film that has totally divided the entire world right down the middle as to its quality. And it seems that Suicide Squad is going to go down that route.It doesn't have Superman in and Batman is merely a cameo. Many will at least expect the Joker to be a major player, but his appearances amount to little more than an extended cameo. Plus you have people who will berate Jarred Leto's performance before they've seen it because a 'new Joker' is still a little too close to Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning portrayal of the 'Clown Prince of Crime.' What we have here is a superhero film about the villains. And, again, that is a difficult premise to sell. Marvel's universe was based on heroes and gave each their own movie to set them up before bringing them all together for the Avengers movies. Here, we're introduced to characters who all but the most ardent of comic book fans, will never have heard of.Anyway, the premise is simple (if a little far-fetched) – a government agency decides that, in the event of an evil superhero threatening the world (or 'meta-human' as they're called) a task force of 'expendable' soldiers should be assembled in order to combat this. Therefore, all the villains currently in custody are brought together (just in time to combat such a threat!).You've probably already seen Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn (i.e. the Joker's long-suffering female associate) and, just because you haven't heard of 'Deadshot' you've probably heard of Will Smith, who plays him in the film. These two are basically the stars and will probably go much further in the DC shared universe. Both get the most screen time and for good reason – they're the two who are most fun to watch. Harley Quinn is wonderfully bonkers and Will Smith plays a bad guy who still has enough good in him to save the universe while being bad at the same time.The action scenes are well done, but not excessive (maybe for budget limitations) and CGI isn't too prevalent, but, sadly, when used does come across as a little blatant. It's hard to say whether anyone will definitely love or hate the film, as – like Batman vs Superman – it seems to completely divide. I enjoyed it. It's harmless fun and does the job. Plus it's probably better than the Batman vs Superman film itself! However, for every person who loves it, someone else despises it. Even die-hard comic book fans won't be guaranteed to embrace it whole-heartedly.I see it as good, old-fashioned popcorn-munching fun. If I had one complaint I found it a little slow to start, but a film with so many characters needs to find a way to introduce their backstory somehow. If you're unsure of whether to watch it, read as many reviews as you can, or just wait until it appears on Netflix in a couple of year's time.",Suicide Squad
48,ThomasDrufke,Worst Heroes Ever,7,4 August 2016,"After the whirlwind that was Batman v Superman, DC needed a hit to restore faith in their product going forward. While Suicide Squad is far from the darling that I think fans were hoping for, it's also far from the disaster some predicted.Although I'm not the Zack Snyder hater that a lot of people are, I welcomed a change of pace in directing in the choice of David Ayer. His style didn't overpower the action or story like some of Snyder's choices do, but I also don't think he made a particularly fond impression on me either. Suicide Squad is an ensemble piece at its core, and I loved the way Ayer directed each and every one of these actors, but he allowed the plot around them to meander a little bit too much.Speaking of the wonderful cast, pretty much everyone came to play. Of course, there were expectedly great performances from Margot Robbie and Will Smith as Harley Quinn and Deadshot respectively, but supporting performances by Jai Courtney and Viola Davis nearly stole the show. Courtney, who's never sold me in any role, ended up being a nice comedic foil for the team. Davis' turn as the uncompromising Amanda Waller is just about as picture perfect casting as you can get.As for those aforementioned performances from Robbie and Smith, who already starred in a film together, they carry the bulk of the character depth from Ayer's script. Though the fear of Smith's ego taking over the majority of the screen time seemed legit; make no mistake, he proved to me he's still a huge movie star who can lead a film based on his charisma alone, even if he is a hit-man. Robbie on the other-hand, does her best at trying to make the case for a Harley Quinn led Birds of Prey film or even a prominent role in the upcoming Batman solo film. Either way, I want to see more of these characters.Sadly, its characters are the single most (and perhaps the only truly) compelling thing about Suicide Squad. Ayer gets off to an exciting start by seamlessly introducing all of the ""worst heroes ever"" in the first 30 minutes, but the film's plot becomes less interesting as it progresses. There's no question Ayer creates a more fun world than what was set up in BvS, but the execution was just as messy. With that said, the humor is much more earned in Squad, and it hits way more than not.With all the good, there's always some bad. With Suicide Squad, they completely botched the villain. The trailers didn't give much away at all in terms of the villain, besides the Joker, so I won't go into detail, but it was poorly handled. The villain reveal is nothing special, and we once again aren't really given any details on the villain's motivations at all. It's a common mistake some comic book films make, and Suicide Squad was no different.I guess I have to at least address Jared Leto's version of Joker. I have to admit, I'm actually not totally sure how I feel yet. He's completely different from Ledger's iconic turn in 2008, but he also doesn't really have enough screen time for me to form an opinion on him just yet. So for now, I want to see more of him.As a whole, Suicide Squad is a fun time at the movies, but it's nowhere near the film I wanted it to be. Besides the cast, it doesn't have a whole lot going for it. There's a bit too much meandering in storytelling along with a disappointingly botched villain. Here's hoping DC can right the ship with Wonder Woman next summer.+Robbie is a revelation+Smith kills it+Humor and fun tone is realized +First 30 minutes is a blast-Plot meanders-Villain is a big miss7.0/10",Suicide Squad
49,Edvis-1997,5,5,4 December 2018,"I would say very average movie. Nothing special. I was really expecting more. It's just messy killing stupid action film. From the title of the movie and from the popularity it had I was willing something like Avengers but it's meh,basic... too basic for me.",Suicide Squad
50,MLDinTN,not a good plot,4,20 April 2017,"This is one of the poorer films based on comics. The biggest problem is the villain, the Enchantress, was stupid. She doesn't do much till the end. And as for the squad, Deadshot was the best character and actually had a talent that would be helpful in combat. Exactly what did Harley Quinn do that was so special that she would be useful in taking out a witch. How about nothing. She is just there for one-liners. The make-up/costume for the Croc was cool, but Croc hardly did anything. And Boomerang guy didn't have a special talent. Diablo had the best gift and him and Deadshot were the only ones worthy to be selected for the special task force. And then thrown in all this was the Joker, whom just shows up time to time. All he is there for is to show how he turned the doctor into crazy Harley Quinn.FINAL VERDICT: The plot was too convoluted. But I'm sure 12 year olds will still like it.",Suicide Squad
51,Cineanalyst,Not with a Bang but a Whimper,2,3 August 2021,"Yup, as atrocious as I remembered--maybe more so. Just wanted to make sure before the arrival of the sequel to ""Suicide Squad,"" the downright impudently-titled ""The Suicide Squad"" (2021). Not that this movie doesn't deserve to have the definite, or definitive rather, article thrown at it disrespectfully. I see the critics are already scoring it well, but it's not as though one didn't already expect it to be better; how could it not be? The only thing going for this first version of a motley crew of supervillains-turned-superhero league is Margot Robbie's (and that of the Oscar-winning Hairstyling and Makeup's) Harley Quinn. Everything else is at best a take-it-or-leave-it proposition for me: Batman cameos, Will Smith doing Will Smith, Oscar-winner Viola Davis getting a paycheck, the Boomerang guy carrying around a stuffed toy unicorn, even the PG-13 ""male gaze"" containing numerous views of Robbie's posterior in underwear that's passed off as shorts and her appearing in a wet t-shirt later. Most of it's worse than that.Bad jokes and clunky dialogue; erroneously edited and poorly paced with too much posturing and standing around; the dull bar scene and mass murderers and sociopaths pissing and moaning about how nobody likes them--I mean, pick a lane: are they anti-heroes or are they misunderstood crybabies; those stupid character introductory graphics containing too much word vomit to read in time or be worthy of pausing to do so during streaming or home video; the most inane Joker yet and too much of him; CGI glop for antagonists and another enemy army of bloodless clones to fight; the pillar-of-light trope marking the center of the apocalypse with an energy beam shooting up into the sky with junk floating around it for the umpteenth time in these stupid, stupid action and comic-book movies; and holy helicopter crashes, Batman, think of something else to film. An utter dumpster fire of a movie.",Suicide Squad
52,ericstevenson,Not that memorable,5,15 October 2016,"This movie is notable in featuring the first theatrical released appearance of Harley Quinn. She was a character introduced in ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and is arguably the most identifiable canon immigrant. I really do appreciate how good the colors are in this film. Well, it kind of works both ways. The costumes are really nicely done and the credits are especially good and colorful. I just don't like the lighting effects here. It comes off as pretty ugly with all the darkness.Amanda Waller appears and is portrayed fairly well. I feel bad for not knowing more of these characters. I can't find the DC Encyclopedia at Books A Million! Then again, they don't even have an article on the Anti-Monitor. The Joker is portrayed well too. I was disappointed that he only has a few minutes of screen time. There's just no set up for his appearances. I knew he'd be too evil to appear on this squad. This film went through reshooting supposedly because of the poor ratings received by ""Batman V. Superman"". Now, this has the same ratings, so it didn't get much better.I also have a problem with the pacing of this story. It's mostly just one big mission that these guys go on. I just think it's rushed and it should have been divided up better. The special effects are pretty nice. This movie has been anticipated for a long time and for most people, it was a disappointment. Well, the audiences liked it better than the critics. It was weird to see another random cameo from the Flash. Even the scene during the credits was pretty dull. This is a mixed bag and while it definitely has its amusing moments, I say you can suit this one out. **",Suicide Squad
53,cricketbat,The trailer was more fun than the movie,5,27 December 2018,"Suicide Squad is fun. Unfortunately, it's not as fun as the trailer made it out to be. This movie succeeds when it comes to creating the stylized look and feel of a comic book, but the frantic pacing and the flimsy plot fall a bit short on the screen. Nevertheless, Margot Robbie does a great job as Harley Quinn and Will Smith is effective as Deadshot. Leto's Joker, though, feels like a missed opportunity. I was entertained by this film - it's just not the game changer I hoped it would be.",Suicide Squad
54,lesleyharris30,"Potential is Wasted by a Muddled Plot,",5,12 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a mediocre movie with a mostly poorly developed plot, despite a top notch cast. The performances are certainly the highlight of the movie, even if they are not all stunning, Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto class up the joint. Smith brings in excellent emotional depth, as well as heart, to the role of Deadshot, ending up being the only character that you really sympathise for, his relationship with his daughter is the most compelling aspect. Robbie really brings this bizarre comic book character to life in a humorous, dedicated performance. Jared Leto certainly shines as the Joker, though he may be no Ledger or Nicholson, he brings his own originality to the role, using his unique acting style, he is creepy, lovable in a weird way and has an amazing presence, I hope to see all three of these actors in future films set in this universe. The plot was all over the place, we are given far too many characters to follow, giving us no one to grasp a full understanding of, there is a lack of connection with every character as we had no one to actually follow. The Enchantress story was extremely out of place and absurd, there was too much magic and witchcraft involved that we, as an audience, could not be expected to believe. It was a strange plot line and is where the majority of exaggeration comes from. It had so much potential, being an original superhero film that actually puts the villains in the spotlight, but it wastes this by trying to fit far too much in to one movie, too many characters, too many set pieces, too much set ups for future films, it is overwhelming, but it still manages to end with us not feeling one bit stimulated. As well as that, the majority of scenes have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever, Joker and Batman, the two most famous characters in this, served no importance at all other than to grace the audience with their presence. The first act, the first thirty minutes or so, is terrific, it boasts a great soundtrack and loads of great, quirky comedy, it's what the entire film should have been, but after a while, it starts to take itself too seriously and begins to jump in to very similar, dull, predictable territories. There is so much good in Suicide Squad that it is a pity that it is overrun by the weak spots, if you are a fan of this universe and these characters, you should still check it out and see for yourself, but I would not recommend it other than that. A group of ruthless villains are signed up by the government to use their unique abilities to save the world, despite the lack of interest they have in it.

55,Irishchatter,I absolutely f****** love this movie man!,9,6 August 2016,"I saw this yesterday with my buddy when it came out and I have been like blown away despite what the critics or the haters say!I have known Margot Robbie since the day she was Donna Freeman on the soap opera ""Neighbours"" and now look at her, she is now the original real life Harley Quinn! She is just so gorgeous, I love Margot Robbie! She is just an amazing actress and she pulled such an American accent. I honestly forgot she was Margot Robbie throughout the film haha!Anyways I loved the fact they choose the right cast to be part of the Suicide Squad. Will Smith as Deadshot was brilliant, he is like the Will Smith we knew from his previous movies - well liked, funny, cheery and just downright awesome! I even liked Jared Leto too as the Joker, his character was like so unpredictable which was scary. I actually thought he was gonna be more abusive like his original self in the animated series but this time, he wanted Harley Quinn even more which was odd. Himself and Margot Robbie were a cute couple anyway like who would say no to them as a couple? Even when Enchantess was tricking everyone's mind, Robbie and Leto looked so handsome without looking gangsta seriously! Even the babies were cuties! The only disappointment in the movie was Enchantess was not part of the Suicide Squad by the way she was promoted. Apart from that, everything was 100% perfect in the film.I have been waiting so long to see this film and I'm so jumping for joy that I managed to see the first villain movie on the planet!

When they see what they are up against even Harley Quinn (Robbie) and Deadshot (Smith) find it difficult to say no. I have said for a long time now that I am tiring of comic book movies. I really liked Batman v Superman though because of how dark it wasand with that in mind I thought this could only go darker. When I head about the reshoots to make it funnier I got a little worried, and after watching it I realized my worries were well founded. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, but it tried too hard to be a Marvel movie. By that I mean it sacrificed darkness for comedy, and it really softened the bad guys to the point where they all seemed like they could team up with the Justice League and not have any animosity. To me that hurt the whole idea of the movie. Robbie and Smith were great in this but Leto, to me, was a little disappointing, but that's not his fault. It would be impossible for anyone to follow Heath Ledger. Overall, not a bad movie at all, just a little disappointing. To me the comedy hurt the movie. I give this a B.",Suicide Squad

Under the authority of Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), and the control of explosive body-implants, marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), psychopath Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and others (Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) are dispatched to defeat the threat.A hodgepodge of hokey fantasy, low-rent super-powers and innumerable shootouts, DC's film adaptation of its obscure comic book is yet another misfire from the company's second-rate canon.

59,Bored_Dragon,Unbelievably disappointing,3,17 November 2016,"This movie was made to match with Marvel's ""Deadpool""?! If DC wants to compete with Marvel (which I see no reason for, and no chance of success either) they will have to put much more effort into it. Not only that this movie did not bring them closer to Marvel level, it downgraded them big time. Without any competition, this was the worst DC movie I saw so far and probably the worst superhero movie overall. It would take me half the night to write everything that's wrong with ""Suicide Squad"". It is simpler to say that acting was mostly good and music is awesome, but everything else is a complete catastrophe.The story is not developed enough and it is full of holes and inconsistencies. For those who are not comic-book fans and don't have good knowledge of the DC universe, this movie is simply unwatchable. I had a feeling like when you turn on TV randomly to kill few minutes while you wait for the water to boil or something, and you run into some random movie that started who knows when and then you watch that random part somewhere in the middle and turn it off before it ends. OK, I would probably be able to paraphrase it shortly, but basically, I have no idea what I was watching. Characters are two-dimensional, without enough background, pretty much irritating, and a good amount of them is simply redundant. Too many characters without real purpose for the story itself just make unnecessary confusion. Joker was the trump card in advertising this movie, but he is a completely secondary character that barely shows up (5 minutes in theatrical and 15 in the extended cut) and in my opinion, Jared Leto is mishit for this role. Deadshot is black?! and too cute and funny for his character. Captain Boomerang has no purpose in this movie at all. Jay Hernandez was good as Diablo and Harley Quinn is probably the only good thing about this movie. She's hot and very entertaining. Everything else is just a mess of redundant characters and senseless action with no point. And production is nothing but decent.Overall impression... this movie is just one step above ""Power Rangers"", and I'm talking about old ones.3/10",Suicide Squad
60,851222,Meeehhhh...,5,4 December 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Suicide Squad"" (2016) is a real disappointment. After finally seeing it (extended cut), the best i can say about it is that it isn't a bad movie by any means, but its a very predictable, mediocre and average film overall at is best. Now the first and the biggest disappointment here is a script, with no doubt. It lacks any kind of suspense, humor (dark or whatever) and interest in the story itself. Here you have like worst of the worst criminals (who are more like a movie characters then real baddies), who have to team up for a suicide mission. And think of the most predictable non-exciting ways it will develop from there - and you got ""Suicide Squad"". There is even a scene in a bar in which all baddies sits while the world is ending (sort of), and writers didn't even tried to make it at least somehow darkly funny - every single line is so average and mediocre that i started to roll my eyes, really? The whole Jared Leto / The Joker hype was just a marketing trick - the character has ZERO of ... anything! You could just cut him out of this mess and result would be the same mess. And please don't even mention Heath Ledger in the same speech while discussing the character - they are in a different universes. Of course, writing should be blamed here in a first place.Overall, ""Suicide Squad"" isn't a bad movie for seeing it once on a boring evening - and that is the best that i can say about this highly over hyped mess. Now i'm a big fan of DC movie universe overall, i even like it more then Marvel to be honest, but is this really the best they could come up with? Big disappointment.",Suicide Squad
61,ironhorse_iv,"Like a real-life suicide. This movie left a big awful bloody mess. Still, it was alright entertaining movie for the most part.",6,11 August 2016,"The marketing for this film has been pretty amazing. The playful neon overlaying the normally gritty aesthetic is great, and the perfectly-timed trailers to rock band, Panic! At the Disco & singer Becky Hanson's version of Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' & Bee Gees 'I Started a Joke'. Even singers, Grace's 'You Don't Own Me' and 'Sweet's Ballroom Blitz' trailers just knocked it out of the park. It made me, want to see this movie about a group of special-ability incarcerated criminals: sharpshooter, Deadshot/Floyd Lawton (Will Smith), crazy Harley Quinn/Harleen Quinzel (Margot Robbie), bandit Captain Boomerang/George 'Digger' Harkness (Jai Courtney), gangsta El Diablo/Chato Santana (Jay Hernandez), and Killer Croc/Waylon Jones (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) being recruited into a secret, deniable and expendable government task force under the directorship of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis); in exchange for reduced sentences, and not having their heads blown off by bombs planted in their skulls. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is very watchable, however, like the Joker (Jared Leto) says in this film. 'I'm just gonna hurt you, really, really bad'. Indeed, I will, fanboys. I was very disappointed with this movie based off the DC comic book of the same name, directed by David Ayer. It was very mediocre. It didn't lived up to the hype. This movie committed suicide, by trying too hard to copy other films styles like 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy', with that of 2012's 'Avengers', with a slice of 1981's 'Escape from New York', added to it. It didn't seem original. First off, you can tell that this film had some studio inference as the writing and dialogue is all over the place. First off, you got, way too many characters and themes being introduce in one movie. You can't force the whole idea of the DC Extended Universe in one film. Supernatural themes like ancient gods attacking earth, don't mixed well, with Gotham gritty crime drama. Like really, how was the crazy woman with a bat supposed to stop a God-like being!? It makes no sense. It's so sloppy forced and shoe-horn into the writing. Honestly, the film would had been better, if they never did establish the Enchantress/ Dr. June Moone (Cara Delevingne) story-like, but if they did, have her, face Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), or better yet, Hawkgirl since it's Midway City. Anyways, the Enchantress's killer 'light in the sky' weapon is such a tiresome clichés. Didn't we see this, before-like, 2013's 'Man of Steel'!? If anything, I thought, the movie's plot should had been more grounded, and should had the squad hunt down the Joker, because his popular character clearly has been underused, here. Plus, criminals hunting down criminals, make more sense! Another thing, wrong with this film. It seems like Warner Bros really wanted to lighten up the source material, after the critical failure of 2016's 'Batman Vs Superman'. The overused of licensed pop songs in the film, was annoying. Not only does it show that DC Studios trying to mirror Marvel Studios style with the 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy' like soundtrack, but some of the music, used didn't serve much for the plot. It was very jarring. The writing and dialogue is just awful, particularly the second half of the movie, where things started to make no sense and the jokes fall flat. There were very few moments in which, I kinda laugh. Half of the time, I spent, scratching my head, due to the bad editing. Way too much flashbacks, and quick cuts. It really screw up the pacing. Lots of repetitive exposition moments. Also, the film is so chopped up extensively, that the action was hard to see. First off, way too much scenes fighting in the darkness! Second off, fighting in rain, smoke and fog, doesn't help, make the visuals, any better. The CGI was alright, but nothing worth writing about. The action was also a bit, too unrealistic. Now, that he got that of the way, here is some of the positive things about the film. The characters were very memorable, and likable, even if they made, the mercenary Slipknot/Christopher Weiss (Adam Beach) into an expendable character and introduce Tatsu Yamashiro/Katana (Karen Fukuhara) far too late in the film. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a stand out. She really does get the character's quips, despite being sexualized like Enchantress. Both female characters are way too young to be, doctors and scientists. Anyways, Robbie's character is probably the main reason to see this film, even if Harley wasn't in the original squad from the comics. Will Smith as Deadshot was also amazing, even if he seem a bit tired. Jared Leto as The Joker is a mixed bag, since he was forced in, as a last minute decision. Since he wasn't in the film, much. I can't say, if I hate the character or not. I also, don't know, how to feel about the tone-down version of the abusively relationship with Harley. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the government official pulling all the strings. She does her job well; a reserve, stern, credible performance. Other characters worth nothing is Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerrang and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. Both were great in their limited roles. The cameos of Batman/Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) and the Flash/Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) was also cool to see. Overall: I don't like bashing the film, but I'm uncertain why DC feel the need to rush into blending their cinematic universe, instead of taking their time to establish the characters in stand-alone films. There's far more money to be made making a single film, then an ensemble movie. So many squandered opportunities, and I really hoped this would be great. C'mon DC, these characters and your audience deserve much better.",Suicide Squad
62,The-Sarkologist,Trying to do a little too much,5,10 August 2016,"One of the annoying things about travelling overseas is that it can be quite difficult getting to see a movie that one wants to see. For instance this film opened later in Singapore and Germany than it did on Australia, however in the Netherlands and Belgium it was playing, and fortunately for me it was playing in English (with French and Flemish subtitles – which can be annoying as when the characters are speaking in another language you don't get the English translation, and unfortunately I don't speak Latin).Anyway, the film is set after the events in Batman vs Superman and forms another of the DC Extended Universe films (and Batman does make the occasional appearance). However, unlike the previous films what we have are basically a bunch of criminals, or should I say super villains, who are thrown together and made to go and save the day against some even more powerful supervillians. The idea is that now Superman has gone, but his enemies remain, then we are going to need some pretty impressive people to save the world.The problem that I found with this film, and it is a pretty big problem, is that the story seems to be way too rushed. In fact they not only rush through the section where all of the characters are introduced, but they then rush through the section where the bad guy is introduced, and there is little in the way of building up as to why this happened – it is implied but this isn't the sort of movie where things should be implied.They also introduce the Joker into this film and the problem with that is that it is going to be incredibly hard to be able to top Heath Ledger's performance – okay maybe they weren't even trying but the problem is that Ledger's shadow will always be hanging over the character and it is going to be a very hard act to follow. In my opinion I was never all that impressed with the original Batman movie, so outdoing Jack Nicholson (if that is even possible) was never going to be a huge task, not so much because of Nicholson but because of the material that he had to work with. However, Ledger defined the character in a way that it feels as if nobody can effectively follow in his footsteps.The other problematic thing that I found, which is generally the case in a lot of films like this, is that there are so many characters it is quite hard to give them the air time that they need, to the point that Deadshot and Harley Quinn literally dominated the screen and everybody else was simply there to make up the numbers. As such, with the film being rushed, and the attempt to create as much detail with the characters in the limited time available sort of resulted in a movie with a lot of ambition, but an execution that simply didn't work out.",Suicide Squad

Only seen a few times and back when I originally saw in theater I wasn't reviewing yet. I very much understand the hate in my opinion a better version would be R rated like James Gunn did soon to release among other stuff that don't matter as much because more importantly the entertainment value exceeded my expectations!

67,Reno-Rangan,"They are not superheroes, they are supervillains.",5,14 December 2016,"It's nothing against DC, but overall I'm starting to think the todays cinema is getting crowded with the lots of superheroes. Just like any pollution or the over population on the earth's surface. It needs stability, but nobody cares about it other than money making agenda. I also think it's going to last for only a few more years, when this trend going to end like that happened in the 70s, 80s and the 90s. And the space travel era to begin which is already kick- started. So DC or Marvel and others, they should be careful, for far they could take their products.Like the title say, it's not just about the film characters, the film itself a suicidal. I'm not saying the film was unnecessary, but the plot was dragged too much. There are too many pauses, or you can call time wasting moments. I could not take another blowing up city concept. And that swirling thing in the sky, I don't know how long they are going to use it in the superhero films. I did not like the supernatural concept which is supposed to be a pure science fiction action adventure. At least Thor was from another planet, more like he's an alien, but the witch in this film, ruined my appetite.The actors were not bad and so the graphics, including the stunt sequences. The story was very familiar. It was more or less, same as the animated flick 'Monsters vs Aliens'. It can be watched for entertainment purpose, the majority won't say it's their favourite or one of the best of the year. But surely there are people who would love it. It was a massive box office hit and I don't see any hurdle for its sequel, but all I hope is it to get better in the follow-up. So finally, it's not a bad film or boring, but it just did not have the midas touch that all the superhero films had. That means a watchable film, only for once.5/10",Suicide Squad
68,paulclaassen,Too many characters for one film.,4,11 August 2021,"Just like 'Justice League' and 'The Avengers', 'Suicide Squad' has too many characters for one film. The result is not enough screen time for all of them, or some of them resorting to very little action even when they're on screen.We have Floyd/Deadshot - the world's most wanted hitman. Harley Quinn - a psychiatrist from an asylum who fell in love with a lunatic, The Joker, who fried her mind (literally) leaving her crazy and fearless. Then there's Digger/Captain Boomerang - a thief who has a knack with knifes and boomerangs. There's pyrokinetic El Diablo. Waylon Jones/Killer Croc - a monster who looks like a crocodile. Archeologist June Moon, who became a witch, The Enchantress, who's heart is kept in a box by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) from National Security. Oh, and then there's still Rick Flag (Joel Kinnamon), June Moon's boyfriend. Oh, and there's room for one more: the sword wielding Katana, whose sword traps the souls of those she kills. And there's still The Enchantress' brother, Incubus... Phew, talk about too many characters for one movie! Makes your head spin!!The premise is just as absurd as the characters. No matter how well they tried justifying using these creatures and villains to help humankind, nothing makes sense. This is a very ambitious project, but sadly fails on many levels. Basically, the film is about The Enchantress and Incubus trying to kill all humans, and the gang of weirdos are sent to save humanity. The CGI were good in parts, but also very bad at times - especially during the climax. I mean, what the hell were they thinking during the finale??! The Enchantress looks like Nicole Kidman dancing on a stage, with an elaborate costume blowing in the wind. (Wha-hahahahahahah!!!) What was all that CGI meant to be?There are some good moments, some good action sequences, some funny dialogue, but in general the film just felt crowded. The Joker was never part of the Suicide Squad and only made an appearance now and again - mostly through Harley Quinn's flashbacks. Ultimate there were just too much going on for one movie - too many villains and not even sure who the protagonists were, since most of them are bad guys anyway. At least the film had a great soundtrack.",Suicide Squad

70,tomgillespie2002,Opts for mainstream when it should be punk rock,4,23 November 2016,"With the DC Cinematic Universe properly established with Zack Snyder's overstuffed Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, itself a sequel to 2013's Man of Steel, David Ayer's Suicide Squad is an attempt to introduce a gallery of their lesser-known rogues and misfits - albeit characters who are no doubt familiar to any comic- book fans or avid viewers of DC's animated works - and have a bit of fun before getting down to business with the likes of Wonder Woman and superhero team- up Justice League, both due next year. Surely intended to be DC's answer to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), a fun, funky and colourful exploration of a host of wilder supporting characters, but the film loses the energy and spunky appeal of the first half as it gives way to a more generic, CGI-heavy climax.With the near-omnipotent powers of Henry Cavill's Superman now public knowledge and 'meta-humans' popping up all over the place, the government is left scratching its head at how to tackle the next inevitable global threat. No-nonsense intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) wants to assemble Task Force X, a mini-army of super-powered and highly-skilled criminals currently locked up in Arkham Asylum. She gets her wish after she demonstrates to her bosses the power of Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), an ancient witch who has possessed the body of June Moore, the girlfriend of super- soldier Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). Waller keeps the otherworldly being's heart on her person at all times, thus controlling her, but when Enchantress' brother Incubus (Alain Chanoine) escapes his confines, she is soon free of Waller's influence and seeking to end our world.The bulk of Suicide Squad's attention is given to the hit-man-who- never-misses Deadshot (Will Smith), an emotionless assassin missing his young daughter, and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the beautiful but unhinged girlfriend of Jared Leto's Joker. The rest of the group, including cannibal Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), pyrokinetic former drug lord El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), drunken Australian thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and a character deemed so unimportant that he's the only one not given a background story, Slipknot (Adam Beach), are little more than window-dressing. Flag is given command of the Task Force, and has his own sidekick in Katana (Karen Fukuhara), completing a massive ensemble Ayer has little control over. Ayer has always been a poor storyteller, but here he also struggles to maintain a constant tone, with the funny and playful introduction suddenly shifting gear and taking us into yet another end-of-the-world story which offers little to no explanation to the huge thingamabob beaming light into the sky.In pitting its 'heroes' against a global threat, the film loses the opportunity for intimacy between its characters, Only Deadshot feels properly developed, and even he doesn't truly convince as the emotionless killer he insists that he is. Robbie is very good in her role, but her rushed back-story with the Joker feels shoe-horned in, hampered further by Leto's one-note performance and limited screen- time. The most interesting character of all is El Diablo, the one- time drug lord seeking redemption for his past actions, and Hernandez's performance offers a glimpse to how interesting the film really could have been. Yet Ayer is unable to handle the sheer weight of all the personalities on show, and in failing to give the squad a more low- key mission to allow its members a bit of breathing space, the film gives way to CGI overkill and goes mainstream when it should be punk rock and rebellious. A brief appearance by Ben Affleck as Batman ties Suicide Squad to the extended universe, but DC seriously need to step up their game if they expect anyone to care for the world they are building.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Suicide Squad
71,Thanos_Alfie,I expected more but it was interesting...,6,5 March 2018,"""Suicide Squad"" is an action fantasy movie in which we watch a team of the world's most dangerous supervillains, provide them with the most powerful weapons at the government's disposal, and send them off on a mission to defeat an enigmatic entity. The U.S. government let them free in order to win this enigmatic entity since they have nothing to lose if they will die. After some time they understand that they weren't picked to succeed in this mission but they were chosen for their skills and they also understand that their true mission is to save the world from the apocalypse.Despite all the bad reviews I have to say that I liked this movie but I expected much more from it. I also liked most of the soundtracks of it. Since I had high expectations from this movie and I read many reviews before I watched it, I have to admit that I was disappointed with it but I believe that I would be even more if I wasn't prepared for it. I liked the interpretations of Margot Robbie who played as Harley Quinn, Will Smith who played as Deadshot and Jay Hernandez who played as Diablo. In my opinion, the interpretation of Jared Leto who played as The Joker was poor and I expected more from him.Lastly, I believe that ""Suicide Squad"" is an average movie which due to its high promotion and advertisement made the people having very high expectations and of course they were let down by it. I recommend this movie to everyone to watch but you have to be prepared for not having high hopes for it.",Suicide Squad
72,zkonedog,"The Right Idea, But Still Not That Good",3,26 February 2017,"DC had the right idea with ""Suicide Squad"". They really did. Instead of the plodding seriousness of films like ""Man of Steel"" or ""Batman vs. Superman"", this one was meant to let loose and have a little fun. While it did accomplish that goal, unfortunately it just isn't a very good film, overall.For a basic plot summary, ""Suicide Squad"" sees government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) put together a team of mercenaries to do some dirty work so that the government won't have to get it's own hands dirty. Ostensibly led by Deadshot (Will Smith) and prominently featuring Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), this group of ragtag ""bad guys"" tries to thwart a plan hatched by the evil Enchantress (Cara Delavigne). Lurking on the fringes of everything? The Joker (Jared Leto), stirring up trouble everywhere he goes.There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie (especially during the first half of runtime). Director David Ayer creates a wacky, madcap atmosphere with all the crazy pieces falling into place, and it really is a lot of fun. Smith has the perfect personality for Deadshot, while Robbie's Quinn is easily the best thing to come out of the whole experience. Leto's Joker is engaging, and just the entire concept is fresh and new.Sadly, things take a real nosedive after that solid first half. As soon as a plot needs to be introduced, the whole thing falls apart. Maybe the saddest part of the whole ordeal? They seemed to be very correctable mistakes that just weren't identified and fixed. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I can't go too deep into what I felt were late-film mistakes, but the biggest faux pas for me was that the tenor of certain characters really changed from beginning to end. Not helping matters is that there isn't anything resembling the word ""deep"" in the whole movie. So, basically, as soon as things have to start making sense and adding up...they don't.I really wish I could give ""Suicide Squad"" a higher rating than this (2.5 stars would be my exact mark), but I just can't because, as a whole, it doesn't deserve it. It establishes an interesting Joker, an incredible Harley, and has a bit of fun in the first half...but that isn't enough to make it a great film. I know that rumors of studio meddling plagued this project until practically up to the release date, so perhaps that had a lot to do with why the tone seemed to change so much at times and why the characterizations seemed a bit off from beginning to end.The final verdict: If Leto's Joker, Robbie's Quinn, and Affleck's Batman were to have a movie to themselves (with perhaps Smith's Deadshot lurking in the corners), that would be something to get excited about. Everything else in ""Suicide Squad"" is either a total miss or decidedly lukewarm.",Suicide Squad
73,Floated2,Doesn't live up to the hype,4,7 March 2018,"Suicide Squad has been highly anticipated for several years leading up to its release. There's a lot and nothing going on at seemingly the same time. The first 20 minutes of the film felt like it was written by an amateur and forgets the one basic tenant of filmmaking, show, don't tell. Every character is introduced via Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) voice over telling the audience the who, what, when and why in vignette form, complete with it's own soundtrack moment. It was paint by the numbers and painful to sit through. Firstly put she was miscast and the lengthy introduction by her was awful.The film has decent visuals and is wonderful to look at but the story and overall plot were lacking. It was basic and generic and we have seen similar storylines before. Jared Leto as the Joker is more of a background supporting character, instead of a straight lead, as advertised in the trailers and his high billing. Suicide Squad isn't completely terrible, just disappointing considering its success and its hype leading up to it. Perhaps the film is better on multiple viewings?",Suicide Squad
74,eddie_baggins,These worst heroes ever make for an entertaining blockbuster ride,7,2 August 2016,"After a solid 12 months of some fairly loud hype, the ""worst heroes ever"" have finally been unleashed on the anticipating world in a film that in many ways will make or break DC comics plans for blockbuster domination and while David Ayer's much talked about film is not able to live up to all the expectations it has been fairly or unfairly burdened with, it's unquestionable that Suicide Squad is a silly and often deliriously fun thrill ride that will likely have popcorn munching audiences clambering for more.Filled with an array of colourful characters (debatably to many so) and tasked with combining them all together to make a cohesive and structured whole, End of Watch and Fury helmer Ayer struggles with the balancing act in the films opening stand and there's undoubtable teething issues for the film as it try's to introduce us to each member of this new fan-dangled squad of evil doers.The film bares scars of the reshoots and likely studio led editing suite meddling that went on behind the scenes and a raft of the squad's players get short shift and the films plot line barely has time to breathe before we are all of a sudden thrust into yet another big bad trying to destroy the world as we know it, which isn't fantastic as the films central threat and narrative drive isn't all that much chop and feels as though it may've suffered from the creative teams soundtrack shortlisting work rather than story polishing.These shortcomings however are quickly mostly forgotten about as the rag tag group of antiheroes begin to get their individual moments to shine as their mission takes hold and while as expected the film is mostly the Margot Robbie and Will Smith show there's ample joys to be found outside of Harley Quinn (and her uncomfortable looking hot pants) and Deadshot (laboured with one atrociously cheesy flashback sequence) with supports like Jai Courtney's Aussie larrikin Boomerang, Jay Hernandez's fiery Diablo and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's grizzled Killer Croc. The film could've almost doubled these side players on screen time without question, although with Smith and Robbie on such winning form it's easy to see why the film always reverts back to these key players.Suicide Squad's other participants all have varying degrees of success and shortcomings and in one case an hilariously short screen time.Viola Davis's cold and calculated government agent Amanda Waller is someone not to be messed with, while Cara Delevingne proves once more she's a model with great acting potential. It's perhaps surprising then that personally I found Jared Leto's Joker the most curiously hard turn to judge and taking the Heath Ledger factor entirely out of the equation, Leto's 10 to 15 minutes worth of screen time (those expecting the Joker show may be disappointed) as the crazed clown is a performance that will be interesting to see judged once the movie going public has had time to contemplate it, but overall it does feel like the films largest disappointment when it comes to hype verse delivery.It's not that Leto is bad perse, but there's something just not quite right about his grilled up incarnation of the beloved comic book figure although it could be argued that his vision of the killer clown is being harnessed and moulded for more of what's sure to come.Not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination and sometimes a frustratingly inert experience that was in need of a much better plot, big bad and perhaps even more memorable action ticks and pure spectacle, Suicide Squad will be lapped up by audiences around the world and should keep a large portion of its established fan base happy, as there's little denying the films fun factor when our crazy group of antiheroes take centre stage with the cast playing them is clearly having the time of their lives.The worst heroes ever therefore make for some far from boring guilty pleasure good times.3 1/2 downed choppers out of 5",Suicide Squad
75,leonblackwood,Expected better but quite entertaining! 6/10,6,10 January 2017,"Review: After reading some bad reviews about this movie, I finally got to watch it, and I must admit, it's actually not bad. OK, it's really cheesy in some parts and the director wasted a lot of time in the beginning but the action scenes wasn't bad, and Harley Quin was excellent fun. The whole Witch aspect of the film was a bit ridiculous but I enjoyed the wit and the mixture of characters, all brought something fresh to the project. Anyway, it's based on a group of super villains, who are released from jail to take down a Witch, who wants to take over the world. They all have a bomb implanted into there necks, so they can't escape whilst going after the Witch, and they join forces with the army, head by military expert Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), who takes his orders from a government official, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who originally put the Suicide Squad together. As it is Rick's girlfriend, June Moone (Cara Delevingne) who is possessed by the Witch, he is desperate to get his girlfriend back but they have to fight through the witches army, who were way too easy to kill in my opinion. The Suicide Squad soon bond together and become an ultimate force with good intentions but they all have there own personal issues, which Amanda uses to her advantage. With Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Slipknot (Adam Beach), Katana (Karen Fukuhara) and Diablo (Jay Hernandez) at her disposal, and Batman on speed dial, Amanda's squad also have to fight against the Joker (Jared Leto), who just wants to get his girlfriend, Harley Quinn back. I didn't really see the point of the Joker in this movie and Boomerang seemed to get in the way most of the time but I did find him quite funny because of his banter with the rest of the characters. Without Harley Quinn, this movie would have been a total flop in my eyes but it actually was quite enjoyable, even though the plot was a bit poor. Some of the CGI was impressive but the dark palette took away the attention to detail. Anyway it's a decent start to the DC Suicide Squad but it doesn't touch Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Although I haven't heard a good word said about this film, the profit at the box office was pretty impressive and I'm looking forward to the sequel. Director, David Ayer, 48, comes from a military background, so it wasn't surprising that the action looked realistic and on point. His previous projects include, Harsh Times with Christian Bale, Street Kings with Keanu Reeves, the great End of Watch with Jake Gyllenhaal, Sabotage with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Fury with Brad Pitt. All of his previous projects are about policemen or the army, so his approach to this film was to make it look and feel realistic, even though it's based on superheroes with special abilities. As I didn't know anything about the DC superheroes, I can't really compare this film to the comics. I did think that Diablo was the only true superhero because of his amazing fire powers, and the way that he went toe to toe with the witches brother at the end but the rest of the squad, especially Boomerang, we're pretty average. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch but I don't think that we have seen the best of these superheroes as yet.Budget: $175million Worldwide Gross: $745.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/fantasy movies, starring Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Common, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Adam Beach, Viola Davis, David Harbour, James McGowan, Jim Parrack, Cara Delevingne and Ben Affleck. 6/10",Suicide Squad
76,TheMovieDiorama,Deadshot and gang shoot what is another misfire for the DCEU.,4,8 August 2016,"Possibly the most anticipated film this year, Suicide Squad is about a bunch of bad guys coming together to do some good and take part in a suicide mission to try and save the world. This is another chance for DC to get their act together and try and compete with Marvel...does the film do that? No. I'm afraid not. Now I'm not a huge Marvel fan so before you say ""Oh, you are a Marvel fanboy"", think again. Let me start with the good points, this film was made for the film portrayal of Harley Quinn and Margot Robbie is perfect. You can tell she is having fun with the role, she has become invested in the craziness of the character. Her Focus co-star Will Smith was also very good as Deadshot but the surprise actor for me was Jai Courtney. I feel he gets a bad reputation, and actually I thought Captain Boomerang was the funniest character, he surprised me in this and I hope he gets a better reputation. Jared Leto plays The Joker and it was obvious he had to go somewhere different with the character, and thought he played the part well. Now with a film with many new characters, it may take a while to get to know them, thankfully this movie introduces them straight away (albeit in a boring, dull flashback method). There are some scenes where the characters interact and reveal some more about themselves to each other, I feel these scenes are probably the best in the film (particularly the scene in the bar). This brings me onto the negatives of the film, if the best scenes are just regarding dialogue then the action scenes are extremely dull and messy. The editing was so poor, there were times I couldn't actually see what was happening when the Suicide Squad were battling against the generic enemy army (I emphasise on generic, they were practically walking slime soldiers). Speaking of generic, the main villain of the film was incredibly clichéd with a boring ""must destroy the world"" plot, I won't spoil it but you'll see what I mean. I feel like a lot of the film was cut, the only reason why I say this is because there are moments where we are constantly going from scene to scene as if the part between these scenes is missing...I suspect studio interference from director David Ayer's original cut. Overall, Suicide Squad was a disappointment with some enjoyable action scenes and dialogue but an unfocused plot with clumsy editing makes this a difficult watch.  Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Suicide Squad

The problem: the virus spreads and produces more and more cells but the quality of the cells is getting worse.Suicide Squad gets a rate of 5 from me, without Margot Robbie's fine performance I would rate it 3 and here I am dead serious. This movie is predictable like an Emmerich movie. Word's Autosearch-Function wrote the script I would bet.Final words: Maybe watchable and collectible for hardcore fans of the superhero-cosmos, for everyone else - expect the expected.",Suicide Squad
78,pmtelefon,A star is born,7,3 May 2021,"The third time was the charm with ""Suicide Squad"". I've seen it twice before but tonight was the first time that I really enjoyed. It does have its problems but it's all okay because it also has Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Robbie was born to play Harley. She dominates every scene that she's in. She's awesome. The rest of the cast is also very good, especially Will Smith. Smith gives an excellent performance. The cast is so good that most of the movie's flaws are forgiven. I will watching this ""Suicide Squad"" again pretty soon. Honorable mention: the soundtrack.",Suicide Squad
79,digitalbeachbum,Junk,1,9 August 2021,"This is an awful movie. Just because you think you can write a movie doesn't mean you can do it. AND just because you think you look like Harley Quinn doesn't mean you can act like Harley Quinn.Harley Quinn is just a regular person. Joker is just a crazy person. Deadshot from 4,000 yards? In what Universe? Captain Boomerang, I collected a few comics with him the 70's but this isn't him. They ruined him. El Dilabo, never heard of him. Killer Croc is the same guy you saw in Spiderman but he isn't like the comic books. The Witch and her brother are meh. Talk about a walking deus ex machina.This is a hodge podge of silliness. There is no structure, no continuity, no reason for the script. It's just ridiculous stuff shoved together in to one 120 minute cluster !@#$. I found it boring, predictable, poorly executed and nothing but a bunch of egos.",Suicide Squad
80,matthewssilverhammer,Uuuuuggghhhh,1,13 August 2016,"Suicide Squad boasts an evil minion army whose design is nifty. That's basically where the positives end. This bludgeoning anti-movie is a shockingly incompetent piece of film in the most basic senses (editing, casting, character building, coherency), who's complete disregard for storytelling in favor of barely-stylish messiness makes it play like a 2+ hour trailer. A garbage pile of frightful colors, unpleasant sexism, angry violence and desperately unfunny humor, Suicide Squad is the perfect embodiment of the axiom that there is nothing less cool than desperately trying to be cool. In case I'm not being clear enough, Suicide Squad is bad. Like, really bad. Like, Ryan Reynolds Green Lantern bad, only much worse. The writing and editing are unbelievably inept, with simple concepts like character motivation and story logic nowhere near the proceedings. Harley Quinn, the deranged love interest of an Insane Clown Posse reject (aka The Joker), and Deadshot, a constantly flip-flopping moralist who never follows any sort of personal rules, lead a team of big-dumb-villains to stop (yet another) big blue beam of light from destroying Earth. They are all evil (unless they aren't becausereasons), until ham-fisted and half-hearted moralizing hits them in a multitude of unearned fashions. Snyder and the whole team at DC / Warner Bros. headquarters really need to be stopped. Where Marvel seems to care about their fans, DC seems to almost disdain theirs with their sloppy excuses for movies. Any hope that director Ayer (Fury) would breathe some fresh style into this universe is gone, with Snyder clearly still driving the bus with his hodge-podge of uselessly indulgent visuals. Here's hoping Affleck can right this mind-numbing superhero series.",Suicide Squad
81,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Two's company, three's a crowd and ""Suicide Squad"" is a mess",3,17 January 2017,"***This review is based on the Extended Cut of the film***DC Entertainment has this superhero movie business all backwards. They've jumped straight to the orgy without taking time to acquaint us more intimately with the individuals. It didn't work all that well in ""Batman vs. Superman,"" but we held out hope that a team- up of lesser-known supervillains under the direction of David Ayer (""End of Watch,"" ""Fury"") could get the DC universe on track. Instead, ""Suicide Squad"" is a mess.No one should be surprised that a movie that juggles at least a dozen characters is messy. What's surprising is that Ayer was the lone screenwriter, which means DC and Warner Bros. liked the script so much they didn't bother to hire anyone to clean it up. Something must've gotten lost in translation from page to screen because the whole thing is scatter-brained and illogical. Given the beats for laughs or ""hell yeah"" action moments, Ayer thinks he has us hooked, but his movie rarely takes hold of anything.""Suicide Squad"" begins with U.S. intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) seeking approval for a project that would assemble a team of ""meta-humans"" that could defend humanity if a threat of Superman's magnitude should ever arise again, and how she has these villains under her thumb. They include hit-man Deadshot (Will Smith), former psychiatrist turned unpredictable criminal Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), a scientific explorer possessed by an evil Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Aussie thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) fire-starting gangster Diablo (Jay Hernandez), assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach) and man-beast Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). To keep them in line, Waller has military man Captain Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) in charge.Each has a backstory, of course, but not everyone's gets equal attention. Still, countless flashbacks invade the narrative, particularly for Quinn, who has a complicated history with the Joker (Jared Leto), with whom she hopes to be reunited. As integral as The Joker is to Quinn's story, he plays an ancillary role to the main plot, meaning Leto had to don the mantle of one of the most iconic supervillains of all time and endure unending scrutiny for the sake of a sub-plot. Leto's erratic performance is far from the most problematic part of this movie.A weak plot, on the other hand, drags ""Suicide Squad"" down. In essence, Enchantress causes a big supernatural problem and Waller gives the green light to round up her dangerous dream team to extract a VIP in danger from a ""terrorist threat."" There's a disconnect between these threads despite the audience being the wiser.Every part of the story feels disconnected from the other components, and the main conflict has no mystery, energy or momentum at the onset to create any semblance of tension — or entertainment, to be honest. The script settles for verbal jabs between characters over any kind of interesting discord; Ayer is too preoccupied with establishing each of the anti-heroes' personal battles that together they all just scoff at each other and act out their personalities in the form of one-liners. Too few jokes land despite how clear it is that the studio wanted this movie to be funny.Smith and Robbie give the most interesting performances of the bunch, though the script does devote the most time to their motivations and inner-conflicts. Smith relishes the opportunity to play the badass who isn't the hero, even though he becomes the group cheerleader at times. Robbie is the spitting image of Quinn from the the cartoons and comics, and while she's not always funny or effective, she keeps Quinn interesting.Nearly every attempt ""Suicide Squad"" makes to be cool or clever backfires and it's kind of baffling. The only legitimate culprit can be how busy the story gets just trying to give all these characters screen time that it never finds anything compelling enough for them to do. Even the action sequences leave a lot to be desired, primarily because the stakes aren't clear enough. Things start to come together more toward the end when all the sub- plots have converged and we've gotten more acquainted with each character, but it's not enough to provide any redemption.As for the Extended Cut, nothing improves the film or hurts it compared to theatrical version. The bar scene, despite totally deflating any story momentum, has some nice character-building touches. The problem is that when none of the scenes feel essential in a movie, adding more doesn't help.""Suicide Squad"" plays like a series of trailers that are semi-stylish in their own right and set to cool rock music but don't amount to anything on the whole. Scenes don't establish themselves and they lack identity and a role in the greater plot. The movie bounces everywhere and anything that does capture our interest is fleeting as a result. That's the real danger of such a large ensemble movie — it's not that they're always so poorly realized, they just never give enough time to let what works succeed. For as bad as this final product turned out to be, I wouldn't mind a little one-on-one time with any of its characters and their individual stories.~Steven CThanks for reading!

82,southdavid,"A-Waller-Waller-Waller-Ho Tell me more, tell me more.",4,2 August 2021,"Ahead of watching James Gunn's film, I thought it best of give the first one a watch again, acknowledging that it isn't really straight sequel, but they do have a number of returning characters. This was probably my third or fourth time watching ""Suicide Squad"" which is a lot for a film that I don't particularly like.With Superman dead, secretive Government type Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) turns her attention to what will happen, should the next enhanced character not be as pro-American values. With violence and intimidation, she recruits several of the worlds most capable villains to form a (highly expendable) team, led by soldier Rick Flag, (Joel Kinnaman) and it's not long before they're forced into action. The Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) resurrect her ancient brother and together they plan world domination, so Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) amongst others are sent to bring her down. But Quinn's dangerous boyfriend has been waiting for an opportunity to liberate her, and this might be his best chance.I'll accept that David Ayer says that this isn't the film he wanted to make and that the tonal shifts were made following the success of the trailer. . . But I'm not particularly convinced that there's a good film in here that's hidden away. The script is pretty awful, with unconvincing dialogue from pretty much all the characters. Tonally it's all over the place, with slapstick next to ""I killed all my family"" angst. Performances are mixed. Personally, I don't like this particular version of the Joker, but I'm glad that actors are taking the character in different ways and it is, at least, a particularly big swing from Jared Leto. Will Smith's Deadshot arc is probably the heart of the movie, and I like what he does. The main antagonists are poor though, and their objective and mechanism is unclear, and that's before they turn into dull CGI creations and then are removed as a threat in the most pedestrian manner possible.Despite what I oddly keep convincing myself between views, it's not a misunderstood film or an underappreciated one.. It's a bad film, and I should stop watching it.",Suicide Squad
83,Vartiainen,Scraping the bottom here,3,29 June 2017,"Come here, DC. Come here, we need to have a talk. This is your intervention. Now, I don't know who first gave you these ideas. And don't play coy with me, son. I found these under your bed. Recognize these? Yeah, I know what these are. The parents have been warned about these Batman-And-Nothing-But-Batman ideas that have been circulating in our neighborhood. Now, I don't know who - though I'm thinking it was that Snyder boy, although young mister Nolan is also a suspect - but as it comes to you, it needs to stop. Can't you see what they have done to you. You used to be such a happy boy. You went outside even when it wasn't raining. You talked about things other than horrific civilian casualties and billions in property damage. There was joy in you, colours even. You need to understand that Batman... is whack. It's not cool, it's not good for you and it needs to stop.Yeah... as you probably figured out by now, not a huge fan of this film. We all prayed that this would be the film to change the course for the DCEU. After only two films we were already tired of grey backgrounds, grey characters, grey moralities and nothing but rain and gloom. And sure, this looked pretty grey as well in the trailers, but at least it promised us something that we had sorely missed: a sense of humour.But no, what we ended up getting was even worse than the previous films. Those films were overly gloomy, dark and trying too hard to recapture the aesthetic of Nolan's Batman trilogy. But at least they had pretty clear story lines, fleshed out characters and you could nominally root for the main characters. Whereas this film is just as grey, dark and gloomy, perhaps even more so, and it had none of those things. There are way too many characters, meaning that we in our heads relocate them to the cannon fodder file almost immediately. The story makes no sense whatsoever and is frustratingly circular in that if the people setting out to solve a problem would have done nothing, things would have been fine. And then there's the fact that you can't even really care for the main characters. Because they're villains! And the funny thing is that they remind us of this constantly.And sure, villains are cool and they can be empathized with, but that last one requires effort. And usually inhuman space monsters as opponents for contrast. Here the only even remotely cool villain is Deadshot. But that's because he's played by Will Smith. The man could play a potato sack with no lines of dialogue and he'd still have a fair chance of being the coolest character in the film. Plus, in this film it helps that he's one of two villains to have any substantial backstory. The other being Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), who surprise surprise is the other villain worth caring about.Had this been like the trailers promised, it would have been pretty good. But it's not. It's not cool, it's not funny and there's barely any Joker in it. Now, personally I hate Jared Leto as Joker, but at least he would have been something to focus on. And had this film even had the music like in the trailers, it could have had something resembling a style. But no, the music is there for a few seconds at a time and never is the scene wrapped around the music. Wasted opportunity if there ever was one.This is the worst DCEU film to date, and that's saying something. Not worth seeing, not worth your money and not worth the effort put into it. You're on thin ice, DC. Get into rehab!",Suicide Squad

86,subxerogravity,Definitely One step above Batman v Superman.,7,5 August 2016,"If you are a fan of David Ayer, who directed movies like Fury with Brad Pitt, you'll enjoy Suicide Squad even more. It moves like most of his military styled movies, which makes perfect sense for what The Suicide Squad is all about. He rightfully treats The Squad as a covert black ops team made of low end criminals which is what they are.Will Smith can do no wrong. He was perfect as dead shoot (That's right the black man playing the White character was perfect). Will was able to take everything that made him a movie star and transfer it into the Deadshot character (It's weird that out of all the superheroes he could have played, this is the one he chooses)I did like Harley Quinn's first appearance on the big screen. It was everything I hoped for and more. Viola Davis, steps straight out of the comic with a dead on performance as Amanda Waller.I could go on and on about how the movie selected the perfect cast to play The Suicide Squad, as it was a perfect cast that brought the comic book to life on the big screen. Watching these guys interact was the highlight of the film.Plus Batman is in it, creating the strong connection in The DC animated Universe. But like Batman V Superman we are weighted down by a bunch of character backstory that does slow down the pace sometimes stopping everything from progressing, which should not be the case, but give it to Ayer, it does not suffer from this as much as Bats v Supes does. In the long run, the developing of the characters, (All of which, most of the movie going audience may not have herd of) turned out to be good for Suicide Squad, helping to make the bad guys likable.I will say that for David Ayer's first real stab at the Superhero genre, it's very good, but skimps a bit on the superhero (or rather Super villain) part. I don't know weather it was because Warner Bros. was breathing down his neck about creating a franchise or because it was the first time the director had to do so many special effects. I have seen him do a better job when it comes to drama and tension among teammates.Plus Jared Leto's Joker does suffer a little bit from Harley Quinn taking center stage. He just did not seem crazy enough.So overall, lots of origins stories to get through before getting to the main plot of The Suicide Squad makes for a group of anti-heroes you want to watch, as David Ayer creates an expendable SWAT team similar to his Arnold Schwarzenegger starring film, Sabotage.Recommend taking a look.http://cinemagardens.com",Suicide Squad
87,jtindahouse,A hot mess,4,4 August 2016,"For the last 12 months it has been almost impossible to dodge the juggernaut of a film that is 'Suicide Squad'. It really has been everywhere. The trailers appeared to pretty much give away the entire film, and I was hoping that I was wrong and it still had a few tricks up its sleeve, however this was not the case. If you've seen the trailers you almost know the entire basic story line. This was very disappointing. Also, almost every clever one-liner (barring a few exceptions from 'Harley Quinn') was included in the trailers. Bring back the good old days of 'The Dark Knight' where the trailers were unbelievably epic, and yet gave away almost nothing of the plot. The movie itself it also a bit of a mess. There are so many characters, yet none of them are that strong. Quantity over quality never works, especially when it comes to movie characters. A breakdown of a few of the characters:Harley Quinn - undoubtedly the star of the show. Margot Robbie really impressed me in this role. She was far and away the best written character and a terrific performance made her an absolute winner. She alone pretty much carries the film and keeps some quality about it.The Joker - one of the greatest characters of all time, almost completely wasted. Did the writers understand absolutely nothing about what makes The Joker great? He's not supposed to be telling jokes, but he is certainly meant to make you laugh. Jared Leto does his best, but this part of the movie was a complete miss. Never once did he make me laugh, and never once did I find him overly menacing. A horrendously mishandled chess piece that goes a large way towards why this film is so bad. Heath Ledger must be turning in his grave.Deadshot - yuck. What an awful waste, of an already one-dimensional and useless character. His power is that he is an accurate shooter? Are you kidding me? Could there be anything more boring? Then add in that Will Smith is still trying to come across as the hero/good guy the entire movie and you have another horrible element to this film. I was really hoping Smith was going to take a leaf out of Dicaprio's book when he did 'Django Unchained'. Sadly, it's nothing like that and is simply annoying.These are the only characters really worth mentioning. The rest are purely there as filler. The DC universe is in real trouble at the moment, after the abomination that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', and the reason is simple: they aren't hiring the right people to make these films. What made 'The Dark Knight' so unbelievably powerful and successful? Christopher Nolan was at the helm. Now not every film maker is capable of the standard Nolan can produce, but what irks me is that nobody is seemingly even trying to imitate what he achieved. These films are so far from what he was producing that it's ridiculous. 'Suicide Squad' has almost no story. That's unfathomable in this day and age. DC has a lot of films coming up in the near future, and unless they get a film maker on board capable of turning the tables around, they're all going to be equally as dreadful as this. It's now or never for change, but I fear they have no intention of changing.",Suicide Squad
88,DarkVulcan29,The Anti Avengers,8,6 August 2016,"Taken place after the events of Batman V Superman, Amanda Waller(Viola Davis) puts together a team of criminals with unique abilities in hopes to stop a big enemy, and they are Deadshot(Will Smith), Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie),El Diablo(Jay Hernandez), and Captain Boomerang(Jai Courtney) to name a few. But will they pull it off? I found this very entertaining, and I don't care what critics say. Suicide Squad was fun and never takes itself too seriously to a point. The cast really work well together, although the two who get more focused on are Deadshot and Harley Quinn, although EL Diablo does get some to do, but everybody else is just kind of there. Will Smith is just being Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie does give a fun insane sexy performance as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto does give quite a nightmarish performance has The Joker, he's good but does not top Heath Ledger, but that is a tough act to follow. Jay Hernandez is quite descent has El Diablo. Now Viola Davis is awesome has Amanda Waller, tough and ruthless, nobody you want to mess with. Jai Courtney is alright has Captain Boomerang.

89,jamesrupert2014,"9 for style, 1 for substance, so 5",5,5 December 2018,"After the death of Superman and the realisation that the next 'meta human' could be malevolent, hard-case bureaucrat Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a crew of differentially-powered villains who, under the threat of having their heads exploded, agree to team up and defend 'truth, justice and the American way', and just in time, as Earth is facing yet another God-like existential threat. The whole premise of the film is ridiculous: in case a virtually indestructible, flying, superhuman threat appears, Waller assembles a team that includes a crack shot, a guy that throws bladed boomerangs, a person with good rope skills, a swordswomen, and an acrobatic women whose weapon of choice is a baseball bat. These mere mortals are then immediately drawn into a battle with some kind of demigod who can demolish armoured vehicles with a wave of his hand, his heavily armed and nearly indestructible minions, and his sister who can dematerialise at will. Unfortunately, this one-sided battle is resolved by having all of the villains' hench-things decide to have a punch-up with the heroes rather than simply shoot them, the appearance of a Satanus-ex-machina, and the hitherto indestructible villain becoming inexplicably, but conveniently, fragile. Leading up to this unsatisfying climax is endless style-drenched slow motion shots of the Squad, limp bromances, strained quips, and the contrived backstories of the anti-heroic ensemble, most of which are not that interesting. The cast is generally good (considering the material) but even Margot Robbie, whose Harley Quinn character is easily the most interesting part of the movie, starts to get tiresome. Will Smith's Deadshot is pretty much the same as every other Will Smith character, so the world's most deadly assassin becomes an unmenacing wise-guy whose principal concern is being a loving dad. Jared Leto is initially good as the Joker, but then goes so 'over the top' that the character becomes more silly than threatening. Despite the imagination that went into the details, 'Suicide Squad' ends up looking like every other big-budget CGI hero-fest. The film is watchable for what it is, but in the end, it is not very memorable, considering the time and money that went into its production (which is my general conclusion for most of the Marvel/DC genre these days).",Suicide Squad
90,freemantle_uk,A fun ride,8,7 August 2016,"We have seen a multitude of superhero movies in recent years, from the ultimate good guys, bad-ass anti-heroes and revisionist takes on the genre. Now there is DC's Suicide Squad, a team of bad-guys who have to do high-risk missions for the American government.Suicide Squad picks up where Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice left off. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is a senior government official who wants to create a team of meta-humans to do the dangerous missions. Her recruits include Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). The team is called into action when an incident devastates Midway City and to ensure compliance the members have an explosive device implanted in their necks.Suicide Squad is at best in its early potions when Amanda Warner introduces us to the members of the squad before their recruitment. It was an expository sequence but it was made with energy as it shows the backstories of the members of the squad, showing their rap sheets in brightly coloured text and embracing its comic book source material - there is a great homage to a famous comic book painting by Alex Ross.Warner Brothers went full out when searching for its cast and crew, getting David Ayer to write and direct and forming an all star cast. Will Smith and Margot Robbie got the most attention as Deadshot and Harley - Deadshot display Smith's on screen charisma, a smart mouthed criminal who knows how to play hand when negotiating with gangsters and the government. He was one of the most well defined of all the characters, having a rivalry with Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman), a Special Forces soldier who thinks the hit-man would run off. For fans of Smith you get more of what you like. Robbie was a perfect as Harley Quinn - speaking with exaggerated Brooklyn accent Robbie portrayal was like previous iterations in Batman: The Animated Series and the Batman: Arkham games, being a crazy minx who has unhealthy relationship with The Joker. Hernandez was also a standout as El Diablo, a man who wants to suppress his powers and seek some sort of redemption.Viola Davis and Jared Leto were also great in their supporting roles and hopefully we shall see more of them in the DCEU. Amanda Waller, a Machiavellian woman who would do anything to survive and protect 'national security' - she can become the DCEU's Nick Fury, a woman who does not have any super powers but can handle her own in a world of superheroes and villains. As she says in the film she has a talent for getting people to act against their interest. Leto is a terrific actor, but it was an unenviable task of replacing Heath Ledger as The Joker. Yet he succeeds - Leto's version of The Joker is a cruder and more sadistic character, someone who enjoys violence. The Joker was spurious to the plot, he was only introduced to the film so he can be ready for future DCEU films.Other characters were poorer presentations. Akinnuoye-Agbaje is a huge bloke and physically looks the part as Killer Croc, but the character may as well not have appeared in the film - he was just a thug and had no characteristics. The pitch of voice was lowered too much to be believable and it became distracting. Delevingne was miscast as Enchantress . Her human alter-ego is meant to be an archaeologist, but she looks like barely graduated from High School let alone have a PHD. When Delevingne first appears as Enchantress she had a creepy look to her, having a dark complexion and black smoke whirling around her. When Enchantress has her completed form she becomes less effective - she did jerky dance movements and her voice was dubbed with an older English voice which did not fit. The point was to make Enchantress other worldly yet it did not work.Warner Brothers and DC were aiming to make their version of Guardians of the Galaxy. They go to the point where they have a pop soundtrack like their Marvel rivals and are trying to match its tone. The film works best when it shows the relationships between the villains, delving into their past and the conflict of doing their job and their own self-interest. It made for an interesting twist to the superhero genre. However, after the great start Suicide Squad does not stick to its convictions and goes into familiar superhero territory of stopping a big bad guy trying to make a devastating weapon and the film attempts to give the characters a connection with each other, instead of showing them for what they really are, self-interested villains. The film also suffers from writing and editing problems, one character was introduced just so he could be killed.The problem with the DCEU is it's trying to catch up with the MCU, but by doing that it's trying to do too much too quickly - flooding their franchise with characters without much of an introduction. Marvel Studios were able to play the long game and it benefited the series because all the characters get an introduction and the various sci-fi, fantasy and paramilitary elements. Suicide Squad was a way for the DCEU to quickly introduce their villains (as well as some heroes) and it inexplicitly brings in fantasy ideas like a woman having a sword that captures the souls of the people it kills.Suicide Squad does not deserve some of the bad reviews it has received; it is still an entertaining and more ballsy attempt at a mainstream superhero film - it has a 15 rating in the UK. Its basic heroics plot is nothing new or that inventive, yet it does work changing up some of superhero (or should it be supervillain?) dynamics and it does a fine job at introducing some of the DC villains.",Suicide Squad

92,stevendbeard,Super Hero Version of The Dirty Dozen,8,5 August 2016,"I saw ""Suicide Squad"", starring Will Smith-Focus, the Bad Boys movies, and #3 is coming in 2017 & #4 in 2019; Margot Robbie-The Legend of Tarzan, Focus; Viola Davis-How to Get Away With Murder_tv, Madea Goes to Jail; Cara Delevingne-Paper Towns, Anna Karenina and Jared Leto-Dallas Buyers Club, Fight Club.This is based on a comic book but one that is not as well known as say, Batman or Superman. At least it used to be but it has gotten popular again in the last few years due to Harley Quinn-in fact, the comics just came out this week with a brand new first issue in a new series. For those unfamiliar with the books, a secret government agency uses incarcerated super villains on black ops missions in exchange for reduced time on their prison sentences. Think of it as a super hero version of the Dirty Dozen. Viola plays the government boss known as Amanda Waller. The Suicide Squad is also known as Task Force X. Super humans are called meta-humans and the basic idea is to use meta-humans to fight other meta-humans. Will plays Deadshot, an assassin who never misses a shot, hence his name. Margot plays Harley Quinn, former psychiatrist to inmates that became the Joker's girlfriend. Cara plays the Enchantress, a magical witch and Jared is the Joker. Cara & Jared are not really members of the team; Cara is a failed recruit that goes bad and becomes the main bad guy the Squad has to try to stop and Jared spends most of his time trying to rescue Margot from the clutches of the trying-to-be-good team. You may wonder how Viola can keep the villains in check, why don't they just make a break for it on a mission. Well, Viola has planted tiny-but powerful-explosives in their brains, and yes, one of the team members finds out that she is not bluffing when his brains are scattered all over the pavement. There are two DC heroes that have cameos; one that you probably saw in the trailers and the other is a future JLA member that was glimpsed in the earlier Batman vs Superman movie. They used some classic rock songs in the soundtrack. I remember hearing songs by Norman Greenbaum, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Queen and Black Sabbath. As the end credits start, there is a scene that is a direct set up for the future JLA movie but nothing is at the very end. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action, disturbing behavior and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Suicide Squad
93,runamokprods,"Better than I expected, but far from what it might have been",7,26 February 2017,"Maybe it was the vicious reviews that led me to over compensate and be somewhat pleasantly surprised by this. Of course, I'm not the core audience, being well into middle age and not generally a fan of the comic book movie universe. That once very entertaining world now feels played out and repetitive to me, no matter how high tech the special effects. But I did love Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy- largely for hijacking and making fun of the formulas. And that's probably why I liked (not loved) Suicide Squad. While not as successful at biting the hand that bore it as those other two comic films that refused to play by the rules, it still has fun with darkness and light and all our preconceptions about heroes and villains. Indeed, it could have been flat out terrific, but two substantive problems held it back. First, the core plot is as silly, illogical and uninspiring as any in the weakest of the genre. Just because the film is more about the characters than the story doesn't mean there's couldn't have been something a little more imaginative to hang the tale on.And, perhaps even more damningly, for a film that purports to be a sort of 'Dirty Dozen' of the comic book world, its villains turned anti-heroes are nowhere near 'anti' enough. They're all entertaining lightweights in the moral division. If they've done bad things you can be sure it was always for good reasons and/or they feel really bad about it. Instead of forcing us into the juicy, morally messy joy of forcing us relate to some really bad 'heroes', these are more misunderstood victims with superpowers then Walter Whites who happen to also be able to make things fly or explode. And that's too bad, because with more bite, edge and embrace of punky anarchy this could have been that rare popcorn movie is truly subversive, instead one that mildly, if sometimes entertainingly, play acts at it.",Suicide Squad
94,kevin_robbins,This is a worthwhile addition to the super hero genre that I really enjoyed,9,17 June 2021,"Suicide Squad (2016) is a movie I saw upon its release in the theatres and about 10 times since. The storyline focuses on a group of DC Comic villains currently serving life in jail. When an evil of sorts puts the world at risk, the federal government comes up with an idea to release the super villains as long as they agree to stop the world conqueror. Will the villains keep their word? This movie is directed by David Ayer (Fury) and stars Will Smith (Bad Boys), Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street), Viola Davis (The Help), Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) and Bambadjan Bamba (Black Panther). The storyline for this is very mediocre, as is the conclusion and villain; however, the characters, dialogue and acting is excellent and so much fun. I loved the chemistry between the cast members. The action scenes and depiction of the super powers is very well done. This definitely needed more Joker in the storyline, plot and overall film direction. I am one of the few that enjoyed Leto's performance. Overall, this is a worthwhile addition to the super hero genre that I really enjoyed. I'd score this an 8.5-9/10 based on an excellent soundtrack and entertainment value.",Suicide Squad
95,XweAponX,"Harley steals it, Smith nails it. Leto becomes the Joker.",10,11 December 2016,"I stuck this flick up in my Plex Server and forgot about it. Then I watched it a few more times, and something happened. It grew on me.Most of the reviews I have read are over-analyzing this film. It is what it is. It's the BAD GUYS. It's The Joker. It's a comic book movie, for cryin out loud! Sorry, movies that ""suck"" do not rake in a $745,600,054 Box Office. So, IMDb reviews say that this film sucks, and the Box Office (and other review sites) say that it doesn't. So ya just have to decide what you are gonna believe. If people kept going to the theatre to see it, and if they keep buying the Blu Ray or renting it, even to this day, then I'd say it less than sucks. Because it's just a fun movie.The More I watch this, the more I think Jared Leto is the best Joker I've ever seen. We have all this dark Magic cack going on in the background, the Sorceress is making an army out of charcoal people. But what's The Joker doing? He's gettin' ""His Puddin"" back. All of the members of Suicide Squad have thing's they'd rather be doing, but The Joker? He just wants His Puddin'. He'll do anything for her.I love this film for the backstory of Harley Quinn and The Joker, it explains a lot about the character. My first introduction to Harley was in the animated Batman from the early 90's. Margot Robie gets it, she's that exact Harley, The strongest points are Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith doing a great Deadshot. There are some truly great moments in this, but it takes a while to get to them.People have said that the Extended cut ruins the film. No, Nope. Especially the Harley/Motorcycle scene. I'm not really sure how the Theatrical version goes, I saw the extended version first. As I said, the first time I ever saw the Harley character was in the late 80's/Early 90's Batman cartoons. This character is pretty close to how that Harley was. That early Harley seemed to be a person who when trying to do the right thing, always gets quashed by prejudgments and circumstances and ends up back in Arkham. The relationship with The Joker has morphed into a full on love story, and it works here.Mostly, this film is a about the Harley/Joker (Jared Leto) connection, this Joker has moved away from the comical Cesar Romero version and the typical real-bad-guy as portrayed by Jack Nicholson and the late Heath Ledger, to a more complicated personality: You never know what side of the law he'll assist. Most of his motivation is for Harley, so whatever is good for her, he does. Sometimes that happens to help out the good guys (whoever they are), sometimes not. That's the other issue: This film is all shades of Grey, the worst people are shown to have some measure of compassion, and the alleged ""good people"" will break the law to keep secrets.By contrast, the Deadshot story is also a love story, his concern is for his daughter. Which is how government agent ""Amanda Waller"" (Viola Davis) manipulates him - And she uses the same tactic on the rest of the Metahumans she's gathered up. But Amanda has bitten off a little too much with her incarceration of ""The Enchantress""/June Moone (Cara Delevingne) who gets away and starts a supernatural ruckus.So Waller sends out the rest of these (alleged) crazies under Colonel Rick Flag (and I am a huge fan of Joel Kinnaman) who is compromised by being in love with The Enchantress' Host June Moone- to hunt *down* The Enchantress. Seems a futile situation. One thing is clear, Waller is worse than the actual crooks in this sortie. Killer Kroc (And I had not recognised Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney- Almost didn't recognize him too), Slipknot, Diablo, and maybe a few others - It gets confusing as the film goes along, with all of these characters. But eventually it falls on ""Task Force X"" aka Suicide Squad to take down Enchantress and each member has a role they play in this. Despite the story clutter, it's good to see these crooks all gathered up in one place. Director and Writer David Ayer tries hard to be Zack Snyder, maybe is able to emulate some of the imagery Snyder has created. Look for Clint Eastwood progeny Scott as a nasty Prison guard, and somewhere is voice and character actor Robin Atkin Downes (""Byron"" from Babylon 5) as someone named ""Angelo"".The more I watch this, the more I find some great Classic Joker moments. Leto plays this as a cross between the Caesar Romero Joker, the Nicholson Joker, and the Heath Ledger Joker (who I liked the least). I think this Joker is the most like the Joker from the Comics. All I know is that, when Suicide Squad 2 comes out, I'll be in line. and so will a lot of other people.",Suicide Squad
96,alindsay-al,A great fun comic book film,6,6 August 2016,"This film has been getting mixed reviews to say the least and I have now seen suicide squad and I really enjoyed it. The premise of the film sees a group of super villains assembled by the U.S. government to take down a supernatural entity. When will smith was cast as deadshot not everybody was happy but I can tell you that he is fantastic in this film. He managed to bring the extra layer of complexity needed for the character but also the charisma and humour that you would expect from will smith. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was born to play the role, she fits it so well. She is clearly crazy but also so charming and charismatic that you want to see more of her. She is beautiful and funny and alongside deadshot is probably the best thing in this film. Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller in this film and she is great, she truly nails the harshness of the character and how morally grey she is. Joel kinnamin plays rick flagg and I actually thought he did a good job with his character definitely developing throughout the film. The real surprises of the film were the characters of el diablo and captain boomerang played by jai Courtney. First of all el diablo is one of the most interesting characters in the film and I liked his powers. I am not a huge fan of Courtney as an actor but I thought he was the perfect choice for boomerang in this film, he brought the snarky fun that his kind of ridiculous character merits and I thought he was great. And finally to Jared leto as the joker, I thought he was great in the film and delivered a different but fun performance. Its just he wasn't in the film anywhere near enough and he felt incredibly underutilised. The story has some decent character depth involved as these villains try to atone for some of their sins. However, the plot is just paper thin and incredibly bland with there not being much uniqueness to the storytelling here. The script has some really great humour easily the best of the dc extended universe films. But it also knows how to use dramatic moments to make you care about the majority of the characters. The style of the film has some good action scenes especially with the unique weapons used by the squad. However, the film has clear paving issues by finding it hard to introduce everybody and keep the film cool. The awful cgi really cheapons the villain plot as well. Overall I really enjoyed suicide squad and it is definitely worth a watch.",Suicide Squad

98,kirbylee70-599-526179,More Dark DC,7,18 February 2017,"Since Spider-man made big bucks followed by Iron Man a few years later the blockbuster to beat has become the comics based genre. Marvel has done a marvelous job of creating some memorable movies that thrill audiences. DC on the other hand, the home of Batman and Superman, hasn't had the same luck with their reboots of those series.A large part of that is because of the tone with which the stories their using take. Rather than embrace the format they were derived from, comic books, it's as if DC wants to reimagine every character and go only for the grittiest most realistic form for these characters to take. I was disappointed with MAN OF STEEL because Superman suddenly was more concerned about the battle than saving lives. BATMAN V SUPERMAN continued this type of story with Batman suddenly killing people, a major no no for fans of the comics.When I heard they were doing a movie of SUICIDE SQUAD I wondered what they would do. The story in comics form had a secret government agency that employed super villains in covert operations. The end result was a lessening of their sentences and a deniable group that could pull of various jobs. Some of that is employed in this film but again, that dark, gritty, edgy feeling permeates the movie and does more harm than good.Viola Davis stars as Amanda Waller, a notoriously heartless government bureaucrat, who wants to form the team in this film. She goes through the list of who she wants on the team as she discusses the project with her superiors. This fills up screen time and allows us to get the back story on each of the members she brings along. The first of the two main bad guys she chooses is Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot. Wil Smith takes on the role but offers a character a bit more human than the cold hearted killer for hire he reads as in the comics. Almost a comparable character to Deadpool, Deadshot in the books has a mouth but in the film plays it less for laughs and more for emotion. His daughter means everything to him.The second main character on display is Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quin (Margot Robbie). A psychologist who was studying Batman nemesis The Joker (Jared Leto), he drove her mad and she became the moll to his gangster. Seriously crazy she acts the part, cracking wise and inclined to do bodily harm as well as quip jokes about what is happening around her. But deep inside Harley also has a ton of emotions she carries in her love of The Joker.Once approved a mission pops up involving another super villain Waller thought she had control of, The Enchantress. An ancient being bodily tied to an archaeologist June Moone, Waller had straight man and hero material leader Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) become involved with June romantically to help keep her in line. Flag is the non-villain of the group, put in charge of them to make sure they follow through with the plan. In addition to that, each has been tagged with a collar that will explode if they don't follow through to keep them in line.Once everyone is identified and given a chance to demonstrate their powers and give us their back story the movie progresses. The group is taken from their cells and rounded up be dropped in the city where a major paranormal event is going on. The Enchantress has taken on her form and brought back her brother with the hopes of finding her heart, returning it to her chest and then taking her vengeance on mankind.While informative the first half of the movie moves along fairly slow. It does give us a chance to see Batman (Ben Affleck) and the Flash in brief moments setting them up for the next movie, JUSTICE LEAGUE. But it could have taken less time and that bogs down that part of the movie. Whereas that part seems slow the second half has a pace only slightly faster but filled with plenty of explosions and special effects. At times the action is so over the top and non-stop that it becomes tiresome. The only stand out moment for me here was seeing Deadshot in action, putting on a display of how he came by the name.Of the characters Deadshot comes off as sort of bland which is sad knowing the history of the character. Smith can do a great job with something solid but this wasn't it. Robbie as Harley stands out among the pack displaying a wonderful joy to the insanity of the character that ties directly with her behavior in the comics. It's no wonder that there is talk of her being part of a trio of Gotham bad girls in a future film. The rest of the bad guys feel like an afterthought. With a few good stories to them those deserving more screen time seem limited and those who don't seem there all the time.But as I said at the start the film feels mired in its desire to be dark and dirty rather than the four color comic that it was taken from. Come on DC, realize that most comic fans aren't into the whole dark side. Check out what Marvel is doing and regroup. This may not be the worst comic book movie ever made, it is okay in the long run. But it could have been better, actors could have been given more to work with and it could have stood out rather than feel like just another movie. It was worth watching as a comic fan and probably will be for action film fans as well. But it wasn't good enough that I'd want to make it a part of my permanent collection.",Suicide Squad
99,juneebuggy,Nothing unique or all that impressive.,6,29 January 2020,"My favourite scene in this movie would be when The Joker pushes his girlfriend into a vat of ... melting crayon wax? Then feels remorse, precedes to save her and then laughs and laughs as their clothes melt? Swirling colours float around them, just beautiful.Anyways as a whole this movie this was just okay, nothing unique or all that impressive. The beginning was interesting enough as the squad is introduced by a government agency recruiting some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. We get some back stories, Batman, the Flash?! whatever, then it gets boring and disjointed with dark CGI action scenes as they try to save the world from the apocalypse.A big cast; I enjoyed the leader army dude 'Flack', Viola Davis is ok, nothing special for her, Will Smith just plays himself, Margot Robbie is good; fun, interesting, sexy. I saw Adam Beach for about a second and Scott Eastwood, a bunch of other familiar actors. Jared Leto is not used enough, is barely in this why? What a waste.",Suicide Squad
100,lukem-52760,Legendary WILL SMITH does save the film but its still a fun & flawed thrill ride.,8,21 July 2018,"FORGET all the silly way over the top & unnecessary Hate this movie has gotten as it's NO WHERE near as bad as it's made out to be!!! Now it's no Masterpiece & there is things that aren't good or make much sense & i can honestly see how the studio interfered to make it more ""FUN"" because of the success of ""Deadpool"" but there's still alot to enjoy, i mean that's mainly Will Smith as Deadshot & the look of the film but it's an enjoyable wild fantasy ride that yes has it's flaws but still entertains.First off it's a really fun action packed & really good visual looking blockbuster movie, You can pick bits apart i get that & it may not be absolutely perfeclt as there is many faults, but no movie is perfect these days because everyone picks films apart so much that no one just sits back & enjoys the fun entertainment especially with a movie like this, SUICIDE SQUAD is big flashy Cool entertainment & I've watched it alot on dvd, a hell of alot.SUICIDE SQUAD has also become regular viewing at home with my family, we all love it with flaws & all.Now it's not absolutely perfect & there are bits that Don't make sense but overall there's too much good stuff in this film that those bits Don't really matter!!! The good stuff definitely out weigh it's flaws for me anyway but hey i mostly love Deadshot on screen & so wish he gets his own movie one day? Yep Deadshot is the most likeable character in the whole movie & to be honest he was the only one i cared about, infact it's all Deadshot's scenes that are the best in the entire movie & it's Will Smith's screen presence that keeps me coming back to this flick over & over again.The fact is that Will Smith's Hitman with a heart, Deadshot, is actually the most likeable & nicest guy of the lot & he's an Assassin!!! See Deadshot has morals & in a very dark world where government officials such as Amanda Waller can coldly execute her own team of government people just because their not cleared for what they've seen & the supposed heroic all American number one soldier Rick Flag can simply watch that massacre & not be bothered by these innocent people being murdered just shows you that in the world their is bad & their is evil & Deadshot is bad but not evil. So it's Will Smith's Deadshot that is truly the heart of the movie & he's the smartest character of the lot.Even if you hate this messy movie, you gotta admit that Will Smith's performance is excellent.One very silly mistake is the eyeball creatures, that are not very well created, they look silly & totally not scary or threatening & they die way too easily they literally crumble if you hit one hard enough so they are useless bad guys but Enchantress & her big god like brother Incubus, are both fantastic creations but Task force X leader Amanda Waller is actually more evil than the main villain Enchantress!!! Also the Squad really should've had a more grounded mission such as fighting terrorists or something that's not hugely supernatural & such a world wide threat as Enchantress trying to describe all humans!!! That's a mission for the Justice League but even with its many faults Suicide Squad is still alot of fun.I'm used to loving films most critics hate so that doesn't bother me at all especially after them raving on about how great ""Deadpool"" is when in my opinion it's one of the worst films I've ever seen it's Terrible.Suicide squad introduced me to a darker edgier corner of the DC universe & one i much prefer & that's why Suicide squad is one of my favourite comic book films.The characters are decent enough in their own way & style, the movie had a throwback dark fantasy feel to it like that of ""Escape from New York"" (1981) & ""Blade Runner"" (1982) like a retro neo-noir look & style that completely satisfies me watching it's magnificent visual style, there's a dark gloomy grungy & almost Cyberpunk look to the film & i loved it. Also the main thing is the Team are a bunch of Great characters that i enjoy spending time with. We all see movies differently & that's ultimately what makes us decide if we like something or not & i absolutely loved, Suicide Squad as my opinion is formed by how i feel about a film & if i loved the characters & here i definitely liked the team & Deadshot blew me away & has become one of my favourite characters ever in any medium.SMITH gives an emotional & thoughtful performance as the hitman with a heart & troubled mind, really he's the heart & soul of the movie & is so good at grounding all the fantasy action with some grit & heart!!! So SMITH is Excellent & i loved all these touching little scenes with his daughter, Deadshot is such an interesting character that i want to see more of!!! I need his own movie & really explore his dark world more!!!Deadshot is now one of my favourite movie characters of all time & my favourite DC character.Also another great thing about this movie is the excellent Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag & his chemistry with will smith's Deadshot but Kinnaman stands out as a great actor & intense screen presence, i like this guy & think he's one the best of the new wave of actors out there!!! He's great as the new Robocop & excellent in Run All Night & outstanding in The Informer, so he's a solid actor.JAI COURTNEY is crappy as boring ""Captain Boomerang"" i mean he is the most bland actor since Sam Worthington!!!Also Margot Robbie is good as the crazy but fun Harley Quinn, she is a good actor but Harley can be annoyingat times. The other team member characters are fine & work well together especially DIABLO, played perfectly by JAY HERNANDEZ, a great performance & A good part of this film. The villain is also great, people hated Enchantress but i loved the demonic ancient witch, she was so cool & visually Awesome to see plus the city scenes look beautiful too, excellent cinematography. Also the music is really great through the film.So yeah one hell of a good ride with some good music throughout, but some doesn't really fit, & an exciting atmosphere, so i don't get all the hate? But hey we all have our own opinions!!! I had NEVER heard of suicide squad until this movie or the BRILLIANT ""deadshot"" so I'm not a fan boy maybe that's why i loved it more as i took it completely for what it was? I thank this excellent film for introducing me to these characters especially DEADSHOT my favourite & thank you WILL SMITH for your great performance!!! Great film just enjoy it, i haven't gone on about the plot or story because loads have in great detail so here i am just honestly telling all i LOVE this movie & even with it's faults. This Anti-hero flick is ridiculously entertaining & rewatchable. A fantasy Thriller that has a gritty & grimy neon drenched look & the imagery of the empty city is beautiful & very 80s style, again BEAUTIFUL cinematography with a nice music score, A well directed film with an atmosphere of dark fun & humour, very stylish.Also Joker was good even if it's a small part it's still a solid part of an overall bigger story & Jared Leto was excellent in all his incredible scenes.I also loved the inclusion of Ben Affleck as Batman, he's the greatest Batman ever in my opinion & including him in a few small scenes was an Awesome idea as he connects all the rich comic book history & it's universe.I honestly think Director David Ayer done decent job considering all the tampering by the Studio & I'm not the only one who thought so as Deadshot himself, Will Smith went straight on to work with him again on the, also underrated fantasy Thriller Bright a Netflix original movie, another great film by the visionary Director!!!Some scenes are really great in Suicide Squad, such as the opening introduction scenes to each character, especially Deadshot's scene it's Awesome. All the subway/station scenes with big warrior monster Incubus are excellent & full of Horror atmosphere. To be honest i think Deadshot steals the show & every single scene he appears in because Will Smith is such a good actor & a powerful screen presence, most of the best scenes involved Deadshot such as the excellent Gun-range training scene where he shows his Amazing shooting skills & deadly Aim. I also loved the scenes in the rain when the gang head in to an abandoned bar for a drink it's a nice group scene of talking, bonding & opening-up, a good character moment. Probably the most fun & exciting & action packed sequence is the gun-blazing ""Ally way battle"" when the Squad & soldiers first encounter the ""Eye Creatures"" & Deadshot pretty much shoots them all to bits as he stands on top of a car, it's a spectacular action sequence & sets in stone just how Dangerous & how Cool Deadshot is. The Squad all seem to look to Deadshot for their next move as if he's the leader & i liked that. The big battle with Enchantress at the end is an Epic special effects spectacle & really looks fantastic & a powerful last shot by Deadshot aiming while drenched in the pouring rain & a beautiful piece of music that enhances the scene to really get the emotions going, an epic scene, some really great scenes & bits sprinkled throughout this messy flick & its a fun ride, a thrilling ride actually & a fun popcorn movie blockbuster.A good dark action Thriller with hard edged characters, it's just obviously not the movie it was intended to be but it's still good fun & a movie I've watched ridiculous amounts of times with my family.",Suicide Squad
101,jfgibson73,Lots of Problems,7,25 February 2017,"I'm not going to try to defend this movie in any way. It has plenty of problems, so much that viewers can see the cracks behind the curtains: it's become famous for its poor editing and all the scenes that were cut. I agree with all the criticisms and some of them do bother me. But on the whole, I ended up enjoying this movie. Not totally sure why, because I haven't cared about any of the other DC movies lately, but I just did. Will Smith's performance is grating, the lack of Joker is frustrating, and there are plenty of moments that make no sense, but I enjoy watching back anyway.",Suicide Squad
102,TdSmth5,Average superhero movie,7,9 October 2016,"Because of Superman's presence and/or absence and because of metahumans, Amanda Waller decides to create a special force made up of the worst of the worse bad guys. In this case it's Deadshot who never misses, the wacky and lovely Harley Quinn, a human/krocodile hybrid named Killer Croc, a gangbanger who can create and control fire named Diablo and Dr. Moore who can summon a most powerful ancient witch named Enchantress. Waller has the witch's heart through which she controls her. Later Boomerang and Slipknot make an appearance as well. On the ground running things is a military guy named Flag who is actually involved with Moore. They are all injected with a mini bomb in the neck which will kill them if they go rogue.Quickly, Enchantress does go rogue, revives her brother who grows stronger every time he kills someone so he can retrieve her heart. With all the death around her, they aim to create some superweapon. Meanwhile the Joker is one her way to meet up with his girl Harley.Of course our heroes are reluctant but don't have much choice to do as they are told. They are sent to the city where Enchantress has turned countless people into an army of concrete blobs. The Suicide Squad does very well in eliminating all these creatures. Then they have to face her and her giant brother but again refuse until they agree. They will also have to face their own issues in the process.DC Universe movies are still trying to find a voice and style. Suicide Squad supposedly had some re-shoots and edits and so on, which rarely improve things. From what one reads here on IMDb, it seems several important scenes that would have improved the movie weren't included in the theatrical version.One problem is that they tried, for no good reason, to turn Deadshot into the main character of this movie. We get more about his background than about any other character. But there's nothing intrinsic in the script that makes him the main character. This is one case where they simply had too many strong and interesting characters. You can't wait to see Croc flip out and you know there's something about Diablo. Harley is a joy to see. But they also have to compete with the Joker, Batman, and Flag, played by the charismatic Kinnaman. All performances here are strong, even by Delevingne, who I'm not sure how she ended up as a model, of all things. She does have potential as an actress though. Overall the cast here is impressive. There's nothing wrong with the story either, it's your usual superheroes fighting destruction of the universe stuff with the usual climax at night. What this movie doesn't do and should have done is get into the DC mythology, which as far as I can tell is rather fascinating.",Suicide Squad
103,s3276169,Suicidal tedium.....,2,17 August 2016,"It never ceases to amaze me how so much hype and money can be spent to produce something that, in my opinion, is fundamentally tedious.Suicide Squad commits harakiri early in the piece.It opens with glacial speed offering up thick slices of cynically self important, US establishment blather. The bureaucratic puffery is broken up by what I can only describe as bland, formulaic action ""spam"". Canned action sequences, made more gruesome by utterly uninteresting, often cretinous, characterizations.For me this set the tone for the whole film which limps from uninteresting scene to scene before finally and mercifully expiring, after 123 minutes.To be honest I was not going to wait that long for this thing to put a gun to its own head and walked out half way through. Perhaps the only good thing to come from this experience was to reaffirm my belief that my time is valuable. That includes my free time. My advice, take your entertainment ""seriously"" and seek out worthwhile films that offer up action but also, at least, a modicum of intelligence, wit and genuine flair.

104,aharmas,"Too dark, too much, too many",4,7 August 2016,"I was excited when ""Squad"" was first advertised nearly a year ago; slowly with the flooding of super hero movies which continuously disappointed me, I lost interest because I felt it was going to happen again. People started talking, and it looked like everyone was interviewing Robby, not Leto (a bad sign). The film was disappointing to say the least.It was an intriguing concept: to have the most dangerous villains and criminals fight an impending terrorist attack. First problem is that how do we come up with such a threat when those characters are already pretty wild to begin with. Place Batman in the position of a mailman, and you have a dark and loud mess again.So the story unfolds, we see Viola Davis, looking tired and frustrated, without any of the energy she usually projects no matter what she plays. Batman flies in and out of the picture. The rest of the characters are reduced to gestures and grunts. Ledger's Joker haunts this film along with Nicholson's wild creation. I kept thinking I want to see the thing from The Fantastic Four, Bane from ""The Dark Knight"", anything that reminded me of a real, classic, comic book creation.The exposition is a bit clever, with a sprinkle of logic, and the only that kept me watching was Robby's twisted and sexy psycho. After that, the film degrades into a loud display of sounds and special effects. Did anyone learn anything from ""Superman"" and ""Batman vs. Superman""? In the end, I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life. I will definitely think more than twice before I see another comic book film.",Suicide Squad

Really, aside from Flagg, Deadshot and Harley, no one is given the time of day here. Oh, and... You know what, that's this movie. It's not the singular huge problems that kills it, it's the death of a thousand cuts because as I keep thinking about it there's always a ""one more thing"" that annoys me.

It's honestly my least favorite film in the DCEU thus far, but it does have few charming moments. Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn are both excellent choices and both stars truly provide their best to their iconic roles. The other actors are all fine, but nothing memorable- and besides some cool shots throughout- the film really goes downhill from there. The plot of this film is an absolute disaster. Not only is it all over the place, but it's edited so incredibly poorly it feels like it was rushed until the day it premiered. The dialogue can also be quite awful at times, and the CGI is so horrendously bland and obvious (not to mention silly, especially with Delavaine's character) that it takes away from any desired effect this film should or wants to have. Speaking of that, let's talk about the tone, because honestly it could be anything in this film. Warner Bros. Largely cut the film to find more comedic elements in it to compete with Marvel and satisfy audiences calling Batman v Superman dark- and honestly this is worse than any over dramatic sequence you could make because it just is so blind to what is going on- it truly takes the magic out of the entire experience. It's hard to say in a film about villains, that Warner Bros. Somehow became the villains themselves- i'm just hope they will learn from their mistakes and bless us with a decent S. S. film in the future (fingers crossed Mr. Gunn).My Rating: 4.3/10.",Suicide Squad
107,adamjohns-42575,And they said Suicide is Painless!,4,5 May 2021,"Thank God for the amazing soundtrack. I think they must have blown their budget getting the rights to some pretty amazing songs, because it certainly didn't go on the special effects or the story.I'm starting to wonder if DC shouldn't just give up all together?I'm not the biggest DC fan as anyone who has read any of my reviews will know, but I think it's because they keep making such big mistakes. The concept for the Suicide Squad, which might have been better when the comic was first written and the characters not quite so unhinged, is flawed to start with. Evil characters these days have to be so evil that they would tear off the heads of kittens and set fire to babies and this squad is not far from that. There is no way, even in this comic book world that any sane government would allow these people to be freed from prison.Admittedly, some of them do have slightly redeeming qualities, but let's not forget that their first mission is to stop one of their own.There were a couple of highlights for me. Margot Robbie was great as Harley Quinn. I have no idea whether she compares well to her comic book persona, but she certainly made her the film more interesting. I also really liked the character of Amanda Waller (No relation to Rik as far as I know). She's not one of the leads really, although it's hard to tell as there were so many characters and they all seemed to need the same amount of screen time, but she really brought an awesomeness to her role.What I didn't like was Jared Leto's 'Joker'. Having recently been very impressed by him in 'Dallas Buyers Club' it was a shame to see that his version of the iconic role seemed to be so far off whack with every other version I've ever seen and I mean that even the cheesey 60's Joker played by Cesar Romero was far better than this.The special effects are pretty lousy too and even the end credits look cheap. I think that they were trying to go for a graphic novel feel, but it didn't blend with the touches of reality. Either go comic or go serious. It doesn't blend if you mix the two.I didn't turn it off, but I won't be rushing to the next one or anything else DC anytime soon, but watch me queue up for the next Marvel release at the cinema. They know how to make them.",Suicide Squad
108,valleyjohn,A Victim of fanboy childishness,8,2 August 2021,"I'm not quite sure why it's taken me five years to getting around to seeing Suicide Squad.Perhaps it's because I heard it wasn't very good but having now seen it , I realise that it's a DC fanboy gripe thing and that's the reason it had bad ratings because it really is a pretty good film .A secret government agency recruits some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse.I'm glad I didn't carry any baggage into watching the movie . I haven't read the comic books so I had no pre conceived ideas as to how this should be.I really enjoyed it .The characters are really good and you can't help but be on their side despite them being the so called bad guys.Margot Robbie is great at Harley Quinn. Jared Letto had big boots to fill in his role as joker and he just about pulls it off .Will Smith is much better than I expected as Deadshot.It also has a great soundtrack.If I had a criticism , it's the the Witch is pretty lame . Every super hero film needs a great enemy and Cara Delevigne as The Witch didn't work for me.Another reason for watching this now is that I plan to watch The Suicide Squad ( the follow up ) this week in the cinema and after this viewing , I'm really looking forward to it.",Suicide Squad
109,Amari-Sali,"In an effort to create a viable DC franchise, Warner Brothers rushes what could of been an awesome movie.",7,6 August 2016,"Trigger Warning(s): Violence Against Women (Without Discretion)Main StorylineThe story begins with a very good question: What would the world, though as always specifically America, do if a being like Superman came down and didn't side with man, but decided instead to annihilate it? Well, this is what Amanda Waller asks. This is the reason why she believes she should be allowed to use a host of different villains, all of which primarily have no real powers so they remain semi-useless, but they are bad guys. If they die, it's a win. If they live and somehow handle the task given, it's a win. All you gotta do is implant a bomb in them and send them off. After all, as much as they all are villains, seemingly fearless, everyone has a weakness and for them, it is one of the few loved ones they have which, despite knowing how cruel and evil they can be, love them despite of.HighlightsThere are really only three characters worth noting, in a positive manner. The first being Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. I highlight her performance because it is rare for a Black woman to be in a role like this. On top of her being the boss, she is a bad ass, a hard ass, and doesn't at all try to be likable. Her main objective is to be good, no, excel at her job by any means necessary. All of which Davis plays in such a good way. Granted, there isn't a movie or show in which she doesn't seem drained from dealing with people's BS and likely wanting to shoot people as Waller does, but getting to see her actually do it was something.Next up is Jared Leto's Joker. Now, unfortunately, we don't get Joker in full effect. He isn't the primary villain of the film so outside of his romance with Harley, if you want to call it that, he comes and goes rather frequently. With that said, in an ideal world, before this movie we might have seen him go against Ben Affleck's Batman. For while he does seem like a hipster Joker, and surely isn't as comical or interesting as Heath Ledger's take, he isn't as bad as many thought he would be.Leaving everyone's favorite: Harley Quinn. This character has deserved to be in a live action production for years. After all, when you think of female villains, in the DC or even Marvel universe, there aren't a whole lot with the profile Harley has. So with the way Robbie plays her, again you get a similar vibe like you get with Leto. You honestly wonder why this character wasn't allowed to be properly introduced? Why is she starting in a group movie where, yeah, director/ writer David Ayer knew to feature her, but couldn't just have her dominate, as perhaps she should have. I mean, I won't pretend that her one liners and being the group weirdo didn't get old, but with the flashbacks dealing with how she fell in love with Joker, alongside some of the scenes she had with the squad, it is hard to argue that Robbie may be one of the few who may full on benefit from this movie.Low PointsStorywise, and when it comes to The Enchantress, that is the downfall of the film. The story tries to give you just enough to know who every villain is, but it really isn't enough. For the actors who have charisma, or know how to play their characters, like Smith and Robbie, you are left wanting more. As for everyone else, you are left wondering: 1. Who are they, 2. Who is the hero to their villain, and 3. Can't they die to give Deadshot and Harley more screen time?To dive a bit deeper, Deadshot and Harley are given backstories. We are told how they fought and lost against the Batman, we get to learn why they are cool, and we are given enough to the point you honestly feel that you are watching snippets of a movie Warner Brothers didn't fully finance. With that though comes those two trying to keep you engaged while The Enchantress, played by Cara Delevingne, is supposed to be your villain.Now, I have nothing against Delevingne, but the model turned actress reminds me a lot of Jessica Alba. Yes, she is pretty and likely fun to work with, probably knows all her lines when someone yells ""Action!"" but she is kind of dead on the screen. Granted, she is playing against Will Smith and Margot Robbie, but come on! The one thing DC has over Marvel is at least their villains, well the Batman ones anyway, are formidable, interesting, and well known. Why use this one? Much less, why have Delevingne play her?Though perhaps the real issue is that the whole argument for the Suicide Squad is that one day there might be a being, like The Enchantress, who decides to not side with man like Superman did but try to destroy the world. That is what the Enchantress tries to do and who do they send? People who know how to use weapons, with Deadshot having deadly accuracy, and one guy, Diablo, who is actually a meta-human and can do something. Everyone else is pretty much impractical in situations like this. Making it so when The Enchantress is defeated by them, especially considering how she is defeated, you begin to realize why so many critics, so fiercely, trashed this movie.",Suicide Squad
110,masonsaul,Really enjoyable comic book movie,6,19 December 2018,"Suicide Squad is a really enjoyable comic book movie but its not without it's problems. It's got a generic plot and a weak villain, who is extremely forgettable. Jared Leto doesn't get enough screen time. A couple of the Suicide Squad members are also forgettable and have little depth. But it also has a lot of action sequences that are well filmed and really enjoyable as well great direction from David Ayer. Its really funny throughout. Margot Robbie is a perfect Harley Quinn and Will Smith, Joel Kinnaman, Jay Hernandez and Jai Courtney all give great performances. The soundtrack is amazing and the music by Steven Price is really good. The CG is good.",Suicide Squad
111,a_chinn,"""The Dirty Dozen"" meets the DC Universe",4,27 January 2018,"I never really had any interest in watching this film when it was first released, but having been blow away by Margot Robbie's performance in ""I, Tonya"" I wanted to see another of her films and unfortunately chose this one. There's a lot of potential with a story that has the ""worst of the worst"" super villains being called upon for a chance at redemption by agreeing to go on a suicide mission to save earth. Think ""The Dirty Dozen"" meets the DC Universe. Written and directed by David Ayer, I'd have loved to seen a hard edged, dark ""Training Day"" version of a superhero film, but what we end up with instead is a lightweight PG-13 superhero underdog story. For a film that want's to be dark, this film features a pretty likable group of super villains. This film also reminded me how thin the DC Universe is with heroes and villains outside of the Batman and Superman. Okay, Deadshot and Harley Quinn are legit DC Universe figures, but when you have to include El Diablo and Captain Boomerang, you know there's not a rich pool of characters to pull from (for the record, I do own every issue of the 1989 run of El Diablo). There's also a very unpleasant overuse of CGI that had the effect of distancing me from the action on screen. Give me the stripped down street-level action of Netflix's ""Daredevil"" any day. On the plus side for the film, Robbie is good as Harley Quinn, but she's really the only standout of the squad (unless you count Viola Davis as their tough boss, who is equally good and probably scarier than any of the super villains). Another plus is an occasionally retro soundtrack that I'm pretty sure was influenced by the much better ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" although this film's soundtrack falters when it dips into bland contemporary hip hop. You also get fight scenes choreographed by Richard Norton (a regular nemesis of Jackie Chan in his action films of the 80s and 90s), but much of hand-to-hand fight sequences are muted by the bombastic CGI, which is the big problem with this film. Batman and Superman films are better suited to ridiculously large scale set pieces and generally bombastic action, whereas this film should have been more of a gritty, nasty, punch-you-in-the-gut type of action film that was along the lines of ""Death Wish"" with super powers. Overall, ""Suicide Squad"" isn't a terrible movie, but it's an absolute missed opportunity.",Suicide Squad
112,robertemerald,Thrilling action DC blockbuster,9,27 February 2019,"This is a Will Smith movie. He has the best lines, is in nearly every scene and ultimately comes across as a huge righteous hero. But it is also a really fun blockbuster with all the bells and whistles you expect from DC and Marvel, brilliant special effects, fast action, fast cars and aeroplanes, lots of stunts, blazing firefights and punches, explosions, amazing props, and massive backdrops. Two classy classic villeins for this one too. Seems all the action I read as a 10 year old in comic books is now coming to life in this ever expanding universe. Even The Joker is in this pic, and I'll be honest, a whip cracking fellow he is! For any fans of this genre, Suicide Squad must be welcome news indeed.",Suicide Squad
113,guisreis,Colorless squad in a confusing fast paced conventional adventure,6,8 October 2016,"It is a confusing film, and that is not because it is complex but because it is not well developed. Characters are undeveloped. Image is too dark making harder to understand what is going on, what is worsened by the video clip pace. There are serious problems in edition - a good example is when Harley Quinn is thrown out by nothing as the blow was not against hers. After the so promising ads and trailers, I really expected much more colorful characters. The background of the characters is not carefully explored because they are numerous and the movie is in a hurry; it is only explained (at best; sometimes even this does not happen). Therefore, spectator just sees, does not feel, as there is no time for dramatic impact. Harley Quinn is by far the most interesting character; indeed, I would rather watch a Harley Quinn movie than this film. Deadshot and Rick Flag are the most consistent ones, with the best developed backgrounds, but they are far from being among the nicest characters in DC pantheon, right? Diablo is visually quite nice and becomes more interesting as the story advances, but his drama about using his power does not convince and bores. The Joker is not bad, and his visual is nice (I liked the smile on the hand) but he does not frighten and does not laugh, what is not true to the character (besides that, most of the cut scenes seem to show him and Harley, what is a waste). I saw many people praising Amanda Waller as a great villainess; OK, she does well, but she is not that special either. Killer Croc is visually excellent but is quite unimportant in the film. Enchantress and her brother are not bad and their magic has not been odd inside the story as I was afraid, but a better direction would be required to have them as the really big threats they are supposed to be. Captain Boomerang, Katana and Slipknot are the worst; uninteresting, they are there just to increase the number of members in the crew. The whole melodrama and slow motion in the final battle suck, but the very last three scenes after that are good.",Suicide Squad
114,davidmvining,One of the worst superhero movies,2,4 November 2020,"Failure has a thousand fathers, but I don't think you could ever excuse David Ayer from the dumpster fire that is Suicide Squad. Yes, the stories of Warner Brothers getting different editing houses to compete over the edit and a commercial editing firm won to help make the movie a near completely incomprehensible mess, but I don't think that the editing mess can really hide the fact that this is a movie that tried too much in too short a time. Would a longer, cleaner cut improve things? Probably, but there's still the fact that the central idea never rises above really dumb.So, Superman has arrived and died. The world knows that metahumans exist and Amanda Waller has a plan. She's going to take several of the worst people in prison, some with special abilities some without, and put them into a group to go after bad weird things. Sort of. She's confident she can do it because she knows how to get people to act outside of their self-interest, though she never really demonstrates that beyond planting bombs in people's necks ala Escape from New York. She never really seems to be in control of anything.So, the squad is made up of Deadshot who never misses when he uses a gun, El Diablo who can make fire with his hands, Killer Croc who is a big reptilian guy, the Enchantress who is a malevolent spirit that has possessed a young doctor lady, Captain Boomerang who, um..., throws a boomerang, and Harley Quinn who is, um..., pretty and psychotic. The group doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but whatever. They're bad, and I guess that's all that matters, though they all have soft spots designed to make them appealing to the audience which makes them much less bad.The first half or so of the movie is cut up terribly. We get a couple of minute scenes, all set to different styles of music, trying to cutely introduce each character including on screen text to supply extra information. It never settles into any kind of narrative groove, choosing to instead jump from one character to another inelegantly at best. This is all doled out as Waller explains her plan to some kind of superior over dinner. Eventually, the whole stupidity of the situation becomes evident with the malevolent spirit Enchantress easily escapes her bonds, frees her brother's spirit, and they join together to try and destroy the world. I mean, if Waller had never had her stupid plan, none of this would have happened. The lax security around the Enchantress's brother's little statue that held his soul is just icing on the cake, I guess. None of this gets fixed with another cut. The stupidity is at the core of the story.So, with the Enchantress and her brother going all blue beam in the sky in the middle of Midway City, the Suicide Squad is called up to go in and rescue a VIP. The stakes and very point of this mission are super unclear for a while, and kind of confusing. We have our super villain team up and they're...not going to the blue beam in the sky? They're...walking to a building for an operation that ends...in a helicopter pickup? See, this is really, really stupid. A new cut will not fix this.So, they get to the VIP, and it's Waller who's just so bad that she kills a bunch of her aides after she's rescued. See?! There's little difference between good and bad! Plus Deadshot has a cute daughter! It's dumb. It's really dumb. So, the Suicide Squad then decides that they're going to save the world, and we get some big special effects scenes and the movie finally comes to a merciful end.This movie is broken fundamentally, and it's kind of sad to see. David Ayer started out well with End of Watch and Fury, but he's proven himself to be creatively bankrupt ever since. Between this and Bright, he's got little of the spark that seemed to make him a promising director from the beginning. There's no denying that Warner Brothers messed with this, taking it from Ayers' hands in post-production. Maybe another cut could help save the first half, but the second half is still defined by nearly impossible to discern action sequences because they're filmed so darkly, an incredibly stupid plot driven by incredibly stupid characters, and a shockingly aimless narrative drive. Oh, and the Joker is a complete waste of space with Jared Leto being allowed to go off the deep end to little actual effect.This is one of the worst superhero movies ever made. And, I repeat an alternate cut would only fix so much of it. This movie is a disaster that Warner Brothers just made worse. They started meddling with Batman V Superman and wouldn't stop until after Justice League. I swear, if you're going to hire a guy to write and direct a $150-$200 million movie, make sure you're happy with your choice before he starts filming. If he's in the editing bay, don't try to rework everything. It never comes out well.",Suicide Squad
115,TheOneThatYouWanted,Boycott Wonder Woman and they'll reboot the DCU,3,30 August 2016,"This film is a mess. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was great. And Will Smith brought his A-Game. But almost everything else about the film is boring, lame and OMG WHY DID I PAY MONEY TO WATCH THIS? I could go on but you heard it all before. So let us talk about the Joker. Fanboys are giving Jared Leto's Joker a pass by saying we didn't see enough of him to judge him. Ummm, did they watch the same movie as me? The Joker had more lines then Wonder Woman in BvS. We saw him interact with Harley, some thug, Harley a few more times and some other guy. We got to see Leto's Joker. And spoiler alert, it sucks. Leto's Joker reminded me of those Jokers you see in a fan- made YouTube video. Basically, he is generic as hell. So yeah, this current DC cinematic universe killed off the Joker. If you fools want to continue pretending like the DCU is anything but below average then you can go right ahead. I gave them 3 honest chances. I will not be spending a DIME on anything to come out from Warner Bros (DC films or otherwise) until they come to their senses and REBOOT THE DCU.",Suicide Squad
116,jadepietro,Bad Company,7,6 August 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Another sci-fi superhero fantasy that follows the formula alright but just isn't super.GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: A band of rowdy misfits battle evil forces.JIM'S REVIEW: Bad is good. Let me re-phrase that...bad is kinda good. David Ayer's well-made but dull Suicide Squad is essentially a war film with ""flying men and monsters"", including a wicked woman who is ""a whole lotta of pretty and a whole lot of ugly"". There is a lot of chaos on screen, but most can be found in the film's muddle of a script. Its characters are ""bad to the bone"", but so is the weak screenplay.Is it as bad as most critics are saying? No...absolutely not, but it is not as good as it could have been. With a better script and a better villain (more on that later), the film could have been an all-out hit. The backstories of these misfits are the most entertaining parts of the film and Mr. Ayer's introduction of these personalities is concise and affecting. But his action sequences generally disappoint, with sub-par CGI and in-your-face rootin'-tootin' shoot-outs and gunfire, the kind of violence without consequences. Some of the jokes between the killer crew land, most don't. Much destruction and mayhem is present without the blood splatter and body count. (Still, the film's PG-13 rating is highly questionable.) The film also has little originality. It's more piecemeal of other films of this genre; some good (The Avengers series, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ghostbusters) and some bad (Sucker Punch, Green Lantern, Fantastic Four). It takes a worn-out premise from westerns (The Magnificent Seven, The Hateful Eight) and war films (The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds, the director's very own, Fury) of assembling a rowdy bunch of bad-asses to do the dirty work and save the world.Still the director continues to be a promising talent. (His 2014 film, Fury, made my Top Ten list for that year. It was a superior film with strong performances and excellent production values.) However, this offering lacks the latter but does have the former. Fortunately, Mr. Ayer has cast his film very well. So let's talk about some of the film's assets, primarily the four lead actors' performances. Will Smith as Deadshot, a hit man with perfect aim, aims perfectly with his character and gives one of his best and most believable performances in a long while. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, a mercenary soldier in charge of the squad, brings gravitas and vulnerability to his character. Viola Davis delivers the menace in large portions. But the real scene-stealer is Margot Robbie as the deranged Harley Quinn, a Kewpie doll who packs a wallop. Her acting has great nuance and she underplays the hammiest of lines. This just may be the breakout role the actress needs to become a big star and she is electric, the perfect fanboy fantasy. (This gifted actress is making a nice resume with her role choices.) The problem with Suicide Squad is the rest of the pack aren't that interesting and are sketchy and poorly drawn (again, the fault of the script). The actors in these parts are good enough, especially Jay Hernandez as the fiery conflicted Diablo, and an underused Jared Leto as The Joker. Yet the other characters, as written, are largely forgettable: Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). The balancing act of bringing all of these marauders together becomes a jumble of forced equal screen time. Less would have been more.Beside a sub-standard screenplay (written by the director himself), the other major hurdle is the film's villain entitled The Enchantress, a laughable Mati Hari-type vixen that shimmies and gyrates and may radiate powerful gamma rays but displays no conflict or personality, let alone posing as a real threat. Without a real baddie at the center of the turmoil, the film has no sense of jeopardy or tension. The actress playing her, Cara Delevingne, rarely enchants, but she does keep a straight face throughout the film so that alone is a credit to her profession.Suicide Squad is not quite dead on arrival, as most reviewers might have you think. Due to some fine acting and some of Mr. Ayer's images, it does have a steady pulse.",Suicide Squad

If this movie was made by a competent studio, then it could've at least been fun. Villan - All the characters are villains. I know that's kind of the point, but again, the idea is handled extremely poorly. Comedy - There are a few scenes where this movie feels like its trying to be funny. Its really not. Characters - All the characters are cliches. None of the characters are interesting. They're all really flat. Most of the characters act like total morons. Action - Most of the action is really bad. The bit where Margot Robbie runs up the wall and ceiling of an elevator in high heels without strings to swing a bat at a CG monster is pretty impressive. Other than that its all terrible.

119,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Suicide Squad,5,5 August 2016,"Earlier this year, Zack Snyder helmed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Now with Suicide Squad (my latest review), he is the de facto executive producer of 2016's second, DC Comics endeavor. Snyder has always been a good director visually but his storytelling comes off as sort of suspect. You can tell that he had heavy influence over what went into ""Squad's"" two-hour plus running time. Yeah it might be David Ayer shooting this vehicle but Snyder's trademarks are all over it. Ayer is more of a blitzkrieg filmmaker, a cops and robbers guy, Mr. machismo. With ""Squad"", we're a long way from his stylish writing in Training Day and his assertively-violent, Street Kings.Obviously inspired by 1981's Escape From New York (the anti-heroes have bombs implanted in their necks) and containing a classic rock song to accompany almost every clip (if I hear ""Sympathy for the Devil"" one more time in a movie I'm gonna lose it), Suicide Squad has a PG-13 rating which sort of keeps it from being ultra-nasty. Regardless, it's still a scuzzbucket of a motion picture, complete with dirty colors, unbearable loudness, and more flashbacks than Oklahoma tornadoes. The simple blueprint for a superhero diegesis is there. Five comic book criminals who are all serving long prison sentences, get a chance at leniency by going on a black ops mission via a city that looks like Chicago, Illinois (actually it's a mixture of Chi-Town and parts of Ontario, Canada). Too bad David Ayer clutters ""Squad"" with uneven character introductions, add-on subplots, and an underdeveloped Joker (played with kooky abandon by Jared Leto) that feels like its in a separate flick altogether.Bottom line: You can call this thing The Dirty ""Cousins"". Suicide Squad has slow-motion, samurai action setups and deep-seated shootout sequences that are anywhere between slipshod and sufficient. In terms of the acting, well inmate Will Smith as a hired assassin, caged inmate Margot Robbie as a crazed psychiatrist, and ratboy Jay Hernandez as a human flame thrower, give decent performances. However, they spout one- liners, make speeches, and emote with their scenes seeming out of place and not quite sticking. That's because ""Squad"" is an editing calamity. It was reported that the film needed reshoots to make things more humorous and less dark. You can tell.Anyway, I saw ""Dawn of Justice"" a second time and it sort of flowed better. I almost changed my mind about recommending Batfleck's, Bruce Wayne debut. I plan on seeing ""Squad"" a second time as well in hopes that I'll reach that same dissertation. Until then, I'll have to give it a mixed review. Rating: 2 stars.",Suicide Squad
120,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Defies expectations more than necessary,5,28 August 2016,"Ever since Marvel Studios began expanding their films into more shared universes, a trend has begun to follow among other production companies. The most obvious of competitors would be Warner Bros. DC but there are others. Another franchise that is supposedly expanding its cinematic universe is Michael Bay's Transformers (2007) franchise. The concept is a common thing now among high-end money making movie properties. However this is no secret for Warner Brothers. After losing their chance to reinvigorate their universe with Green Lantern (2011), DC tried again with Man of Steel (2013) and finally brought themselves back from a long period of dormancy. So in order to catch up to Marvel's output, the next choice was making Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). It certainly brought the studio up to speed but whom are they fooling? There were a lot of missteps taken to get there. Adding to that is this movie which promisingly looked like DC's Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), but with villains. Sadly this was not as great as one would hope.This is actually rather shocking considering the cast and crew involved. Crediting himself as writer/director is David Ayer, the same man who headed praiseworthy projects like End of Watch (2012) and Fury (2014). The story is based on the comic about Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruiting the worst villains from Arkham Asylum to fight what the regular military would or could not defeat. That means bringing on Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Capt. Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), June Moone AKA Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Slipknot (Adam Beach) and Katana (Karen Fukuhara) under the command of Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) to take down a powerful force that only they can stop. Meanwhile on the side, the Joker (Jared Leto) is up to no good looking to find a way to break his joker queen out of the iron grasp of Amanda Waller. Initially this sounds fine but the story lacks structure.Close to the start, the conflict begins and the suicide squad is sent out to pacify it. Yet before this even happens, Amanda Waller assembled them to take care of a different reason. This different reason is completely dropped once the main struggle arises. So what was the original mission they were going to be sent on? It's never answered. Either that or editor John Gilroy put the scenes in the wrong order. And Gilroy has been the editor to a number of popular films like Salt (2010) and Pacific Rim (2013). So what gives? Along with that are some backstories that are briefly skimmed over. Why? This film has a two hour run time; Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) has the exact same. Nonetheless even with these written issues, the actors perform well in their roles and are likable to a certain degree. Some of them even have more human backstories than one would expect. The costume/character designs are also commendable. For once, these characters have some color in their suits and aren't so dark and brooding like Bats or Sups.Speaking of which, Ben Affleck as the caped crusader does have a few scenes throughout the movie. Is it worth it? Sort of from a narrative standpoint but in other ways it just feels like Batman was put in to have more people view the film. The action at least entertains for the most part as well. Deadshot's ability to be precise in every round he shoots is awesome. Katana use of the sword is sharper than your average kitchen knife (of course). El Diablo knows how to heat up people's nights with his powers and Harley Quinn's gymnastic acrobatics certainly make her a special addition. Regrettably this does not make up for the sections that have CGI overload. Thankfully it does not get as bad as Batman V Superman with its almost PS2 gameplay like cut scenes, but there are still unnecessary moments. Whether it's the adversary the suicide squad has to fight against or even if it's digitally editing Harley Quinn to have booty shorts. It just seems like wasted amounts where this particular effect is abused for the wrong reasons.Roman Vasyanov was chosen to provide the cinematography to this picture. Vasyanov also worked with Ayer on End of Watch (2012) and Fury (2014). This shows that Vasyanov knows how to make great or accurate looking movies. Fury (2014) had great looking camera-work and End of Watch (2012) made the viewer feel like they were in the movie. None of that's shown here. It's strange too. With all the colorful personalities and costumes, one would think that this movie would have brighter images to show. There are about 2-3 scenes that have daylight in them. Every other scene is in the dark or it's raining. All it does is remind the viewer of how gloomy looking the previous Zack Snyder DC films were presented. It's frustrating. Composing the film score to this movie was Steven Price, another David Ayer collaborator. Price's work is another disappointment. Unlike his past work in films like Fury (2014), there is no reoccurring theme for the suicide squad. And this is the perfect time to establish one for them. But that wasn't done.Unlike what one would expect, this David Ayer film has its moments due to its cast, action and part of its writing, but that's all it can be given. The music isn't memorable, the camera-work doesn't match the colorful characters or tone and the overall plot doesn't make sense for a two-hour film.",Suicide Squad
121,rannynm,"Awesome soundtrack, unbelievable acting, intriguing storyline, great cast",8,25 August 2016,"With the awesome soundtrack, unbelievable acting, intriguing story line and perfect cast members, this film is one I definitely recommend seeing. The film is about an assembled team of the most dangerous villains in the world who are sent on a mission to defeat a bigger evil entity. The film's twist on typical superhero movies really stands out as the antagonists take the spotlight for once. The squad is composed of fearless felons with nothing to lose. Their actions, hidden agendas and intentions are absolutely unpredictable. One of the best aspects of this movie is the cast and their outstanding acting. Margot Robbie's role as Harley Quinn is jaw dropping and Jared Leto deserves lots of credit for his performance as the Joker. They played their roles so amazingly well that it was hard for me to imagine them as people outside of their roles here. Their facial expressions, from scene to scene, is unbelievable. All of the characters' portrayals are amazing. Deadshot, played wonderfully by Will Smith, provides a comedic and emotional aspect as he tries to hold a loving relationship with his daughter throughout the main conflict. What makes the characters so memorable and the film intriguing is that each one has its own twisted story and talent. The soundtrack is awesome and the film's use of lot of good songs made certain scenes especially memorable. Overall, this film is a fun movie and, if you go in to see it with no specific expectation or comparison with another film, I can't imagine anyone not liking it. The idea may have been typical but the execution was superb. Sure people argue that it is just another superhero movie and make many comparisons to other superhero films, but I think the style this film has, including the acting, music, camera work and visuals puts this film above others. I recommend this film for people ages 13 to 18 and think adults will enjoy it as well, especially those who like twisted, psychotic and creepy vibes because, although I am not a fan of action movies, the psychotic and creepy feel made it really interesting for me. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Harmony M, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",Suicide Squad
122,justin-fencsak,The nail in the coffin for DCEU movies until Wonder Woman came out...,6,2 August 2017,"When this movie opened during the same weekend as the Summer Olympics in Rio on TV, it broke a record set by Guardians two years prior to the first weekend of August 2016. Reaction to the movie was a bit mixed yet it was more comedic than the seriousness of BVS: DOJ, which ranks among the worst superhero movies of all time if you exclude the extended version. Jared Leto's Joker doesn't live up to Heath Ledger or even Jack Nicholson; the only saving grace in this movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn in the first live action role for this character, which actually debuted in the 1992 Batman cartoon before starring in the comic books. The soundtrack to this movie is great, and the visual effects are OK.",Suicide Squad
123,Kingslaay,Absolutely terrible,5,25 April 2017,"This was a mess of a film, a travesty. I do not know where to begin because so many things do not work and make this film fly. Will Smith does all he can to carry this movie. The plot was weak and hard to buy into. One of the biggest problems is the squad themselves. It's like they decided to put together the most unimpressive and dull creatures in one team. Was there a half crocodile half man? Seriously? Katana also shows up and barely utters a word, it was like they added too many useless members to the squad. Each one was more unimpressive than the other. The villain was also equally bad and it was one train wreck after another. The scenario where the squad who is made up of bad guys forced to go after a mistake that the good guys made in the first place was just too hard to buy into and poorly sold. This is storytelling at its worst. Everyone also looked forward to Jared Leto's Joker who gave a weird and mediocre portrayal of the joker. It was so unimpressive and sad to watch, he was given little screen time but if they cut him out it would have not made a difference. This movie is not recommended but I do recommend that Zac Snyder be prevented from having any involvement in superhero movies. Each one is a train wreck and disappointing a number of fans across the globe.",Suicide Squad
124,lemon_magic,"Kind of a slog at times, elements of interest.",6,30 August 2016,"First things first: Jared Leto's supposedly controversial performance as the Joker? Not a big fan. To quote a friend, he's basically playing the role as a tweaker with a violent streak. Leto is OK in this, don't get me wrong, but he is not the reason to see the film. Leto is still a pro and a talented guy, so he's not the reason to skip the film, either. Is the movie worth your time? Well, I was a fan of Ostrander's original Suicide Squad run from the 90's, and for the film includes most of what made that series fun, including Amanda Waller, Deadshot, Boomerang and Killer Croc. And the ""new girl"" Harley Quinn is pretty much done right also. So if being a fan of those characters is your main motivation to see the film, you'll probably be happy. On the other hand, it's too loud, too long, half the soundtrack choices don't work for me, and this was the wrong ""first mission"" for the way the original Squad was conceived. Seriously, it's like watching a grimmer version of the original GhostBusters, crossed with Resident Evil. To me, Suicide Squad was always about politics, covert ops, super-villains perishing anonymously and uselessly in far-away lands, and snarky, cynical humor.Good to watch as a popcorn-munching Summer blockbuster to kill an afternoon.",Suicide Squad

128,bkrauser-81-311064,Sabotage,4,7 August 2016,"If anything, Suicide Squad should be viewed as a cautionary tale for eager film students worried about the perversion of their vision by crass, avaricious and abusive film executives and studios. Thus far Director David Ayer has been towing the line, but there's no telling if and when he'll be lobbing accusations of studio meddling in the near future. Somewhere deep, deep, deep, deep down in the ashy crevasses of this film's soul, lies a good movie. One that has no need for contrived plots and flashbacks doubling as character development. Yet as it stands, the theatrical version of this set of tangentially related scenes is nothing more than a floppy, limping, barely-alive footnote in the joyless black parade that is the DC Extended Universe. At this point the only argument that can be made in favor of this film's merits is that it's not Batman Vs. Superman (2016).The Suicide Squad is the brain child of one Amanda Waller (Davis), an ambitious government official who wants to pilot a Black Ops team of arch-criminals who can go into high-risk situations and do...stuff. She recruits Col. Rick Flag (Kinnaman) to train and lead the team which includes ""Metahumans"" Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje), El Diablo (Hernandez) and Dr. June Moone aka Enchantress (Delevingne). Also along for the ride are professional criminals Deadshot (Smith), Captain Boomerang (Courtney) and Slipknot (Beach) as well as Flag's sword wielding bodyguard Katana (Fukuhara). The plot then bends over backwards to get these guys unchained and let loose into Midway City with the Joker (Leto) in hot pursuit so he can rescue the team's only real liability Harley Quinn (Robbie) who is there because...wait, why is she on the team again?If the first rule of visual storytelling is ""don't tell the audience what they already know,"" then this movie not only breaks that rule but sets it on fire then stomps on it. We are introduced to our anti-heroes, their arsenals and their motivations for accepting such a cockamamie scheme a handful of times. At one point the film straight up brings out the files on them, followed by on-the-nose theme music, personifying tile cards and stats resembling a ""choose your character"" mod on a cheap video game. Then we get the flashbacks oh the flashbacks, which are not there to service the story at all but are there to remind you whether not you like it, Jared Leto is going to be playing the Joker for a while and Ben Affleck is still Batman.And what of The Joker whose appearance in this movie has been hyped to the point of frenzy? Well if he's the reason you came to see Suicide Squad then you're in for a bad case of blue balls. The man is barely in this film, sharing what little screen-time he has with Harley, a gaggle of Panda-suit wearing henchmen and Common. When he is on screen he lurches and leers but does very little that's scary, funny or even remotely interesting.Likewise Harley is at her best a pale imitation of Heath Ledger's Joker, interjecting El Diablo's tragic backstory with a nihilistic ""own that s**t"" that she herself doesn't even believe. At her worst though she's a skimpy, studio assembled, polyester sex pot whose strength is undermined by an abusive romance that has pockmarked many a comic book. She holds her own in a few fights and actress Margot Robbie does seem to be having some fun, but the image of her perched atop a wrecked taxi in the rain bemoaning the loss of her ""puddin"" is enough to dismantle the entire idea that she can be her own character.There are a few standouts including Jai Courtney as the flamboyantly named Captain Boomerang. He's a cut-and-run jerk through and through and revels in the douche-baggery of his own making. Plus since he's not exactly part of the squads inner-ring, he's immune to the film telling us what he's about three or four times. Will Smith's Deadshot character arc is treated with a modicum of respect which is aptly complimented by the man actually trying for the first time in ten years. Yet even then you can tell that there was a lot of him left on the cutting room floor. The film settles for giving the character the complexity of an average paint-by-numbers anti-hero with a secret heart of gold. A heart that's not coaxed out by anything more substantial than the budding bromance between himself and Col. Flag.Months of rumored extensive re-shoots have yielded the exact same problems that plagued DC's last attempt to compete with Marvel. Nearly every cut in this film feels like a battle between David Ayer, studio heads and Executive Producer Zack Snyder in an attempt to conform to a PG-13 rating, pander to the fans and keep the look and feel of the larger universe they plan to somehow cobble together. Unlike Batman V. Board of Education's reddit inspired pretentiousness, Suicide Squad has a longing unrequited desire to just have some fun. Yet any fun to be had is over-complicated by franchise maintenance and a villain reveal that could have been avoided if Amanda Waller had simply scrapped her Black Ops team at conception. Well, at least Suicide Squad has the distinction of casting Adam Beach playing the first First Nation hero in a mainstream superhero film...oh wait.",Suicide Squad

Entertaining but woefully messy.",5,29 May 2017,"There comes a certain point where as fans, we need to stop the squabbling, in-fighting and blame-throwing and face the bottom line. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it needs to be said- as it stands, the DC Extended Universe is failing. From the mediocrity and bizarre dreariness of ""Man of Steel"", through the intolerably disjointed and obnoxious ""Batman V Superman"", to the patchy filmmaking of ""Suicide Squad""... things are not looking good. And the worst part is the excuses and denial. I've seen it time and again. Justification for the sub-par storytelling and hackneyed direction... excuses for the complete lack of character motivation and humanity... dismissal of any criticism no matter how constructive it may be... all because people are too in love with these characters to admit that something is critically wrong. People... something is wrong. Very wrong. And we need to admit it, whether you like it or not.""Suicide Squad"" is the third entry in DC's growing cinematic universe. And while it may not quite falter and fall as flat as 2016's other major release in the franchise (""Batman V Superman""), it still stands as merely a blaring example of mediocrity. Obviously butchered by re-shoots and re-edits and lacking a strong narrative cohesion, it may very well be an entertaining and sometimes thrilling experience, but it's a very troubled on. But hey... at least it's kinda fun to watch.In a refreshingly straightforward tale, ""Suicide Squad"" follows the assembly of a task-force made up of various imprisoned super- villains and criminals, including the reptilian ""Killer Croc"" (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), pyrokinetic ""El Diablo"" (Jay Hernandez), conflicted mercenary ""Deadshot"" (Will Smith), mouthy crook ""Captain Boomerang"" (Jai Courtney) and the lover of the legendary clown prince of crime, Harley Quinn. (Margot Robbie) When one of the team's recruits- the incredibly powerful ""Enchantress"" (Cara Delevingne)- goes rogue and threatens to destroy the world, it's up to the bad-guys to save the day. ...oh, and I guess there's some stuff in there with Jared Leto as ""The Joker"", but it doesn't really matter.The big problem here is that the film has a lot of potential that feels lost at the hands of a director sloppily trying to juggle several different tonalities and a studio trying to make the film as widely appealing as possible by sheepishly cutting around the more challenging scenes and throwing in pandering references for hardcore fans that come off as contrived and irritating. It's no secret that there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes drama with re-edits and re-shoots galore, with the studio going so far as to hire a trailer-editing company to do their own cut of the film to make it faster and more similar to one of the more popular previews... and oh boy, do these production troubles rear their head often. The pacing and focus is a complete mess much of the time and the film rockets by many key scenes with all the grace of a tap-dancer on a greased floor, leaving the viewer too often lost in the shuffle even with a relatively standard and predictable story. This isn't helped by the painfully generic ""gritty"" guidance from writer/director David Ayer, who is so focused on shaky camera-work, aesthetically ""dark"" visuals and general bland ""ugliness"" that you might actually stop and ask yourself if you somehow wandered into a Rob Zombie film. I'm sorry, but I've just about had it with these falsely manufactured ""gritty"" films where it goes so far over the top with its style that it becomes laughable and cringe-worthy. If its to the service of nothing but self-indulgence and a misguided attempt at being ""edgy"", it's not innovation... it's tedium. I'm not saying you can't make a gritty film... I'm saying you have to make it right. And this just feels ridiculous. Do we really need a Joker covered in High School goth tattoos, a Harley Quinn with smudged makeup and fishnets and a villain who is so ""evil"" that her henchmen are literally made of anthropomorphic grime? It's forced.But at the same time... I'd be lying if I said I didn't have some fun with the film, and can see hints of brilliance desperately clawing beneath the surface. So I can't say the film is a total loss. Outside of a woefully miscast and sometimes painful to watch Jared Leto, the rest of the cast shines. (And that's all the mention Leto will get, as he's barely in the movie as has been stated over and over.) Particularly Robbie, who is a complete joy despite being over-sexualized way too often. She's a ton of fun and I could see her being phenomenal in the role in future installments. I also quite admired Will Smith and even the absolutely delightful Viola Davis, who appears in a supporting role. And hey... the movie even made me like Jai Courtney! And that's nothing to sneeze at, as he's usually the cinematic kiss of death. The action can be very thrilling and there's some great effects work being done both digitally and with its award-winning makeup. Some of the jokes land well, and there's a few genuinely great sequences peppered in. And hey, even if I hate his work in the majority of the film, Ayer does have some very creative visuals up his sleeve that pop up now and again.It comes down to this. If you're looking for the film to redeem the struggling DC Extended Universe, this sadly isn't it. It has potential, and it's arguably the best of the three thus-far released. But it has many problems all its own. However, if you're looking for some mindless fun with some good action, a couple of laughs and a few great performances, it won't disappoint. I just firmly believe that we need to put the pressure on the studio-suits and push them to do better work. DC deserves better.I give ""Suicide Squad"" an average 5 out of 10.",Suicide Squad

(PG-13)Deadshot (Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), and a bunch of other nasties with no more than one or two provided character traits are assembled to take down an even nastier entity, an archaeologist (Delevingne) possessed by an evil sorceress; no bets will be taken over whether or not there's a sky-beam during the climax. Ignoring the illogical premise of a team of supervillains being used for dangerous black ops missions, this overstuffed movie can't decide on just about anything: its tone, its visual style, its narrative direction, its very reason for existing. A soundtrack full of pop songs, a series of incoherent fights, and the occasional ""cool guy pose"" and wisecrack does not a good film make. Limp storytelling and erratic action filmmaking is (sadly) almost expected for an enterprise like this, but it's also atrociously conceived and constructed, a blare of chaotic sound mixing and spastic scene transitions that confuses frothing freneticism with heart-pounding excitement. Aside from Robbie, who is just unpredictably zany enough to really wish she and her character were transplanted to a different project, the cast is either completely wasted (Smith, Davis, etc.) or completely misconceived (Leto, Delevingne, etc.).

138,Screen_Blitz,"Supervillains unite for plenty of action, but not enough wit",5,7 August 2016,"With the Marvel Cinematic Universe skyrocketing in the popularity, the DC Universe has been subject to various attempts to get caught up on their path. DC was up to a fairly good start in the summer of 2013 when they rebooted the Superman franchise with 'Man of Steel', a spectacular cinematic representation of the one of the most iconic superheroes in store. Their progress however, fell short after the disappointing release of 'Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice', the film that failed to bring nuance and justice tot the portrayal of our heroes. DC Universe's second chance is then lied into the hands of this dark supervillain flick directed and written by David Ayer (Fury, End of Watch). Though this movie glorifies great creative autonomy in the portrayal of DC's notorious individuals, the heart of this cinematic piece finds itself plagued in the sea of mediocre writing and a lack of substance; though there is some fun to offered here. Following the events of Batman V. Superman, the film enters Viola Davis as intelligence operative Amanda Waller who recruits a gang of notorious villains on a mission to stop the evil Enchantress, who is possessed the body of archaeologist Dr. June Moone (played by Cara Delevingne, from taking over the world. Under the supervision Black Ops Colonel Rick Flag (played by Joel Kinnaman), the team includes gun-totting Deadshot (played by Will Smith), the sexy but deranged Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie) who is more interested in reuniting with the Joker (played by Jared Leto), the slick thief Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), the monstrous green creature Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the flame wielding El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez, master assassin Slipknot (played by Adam Beach), and expert swordsman Katana (played by Karen Fukuhara).For a film as highly anticipated as this, this one may have the fun and humor to make up for an okay experience, but it definitely falls short of expectations, especially for the fanboys those who read the comics; and there a plenty of flaws that taint this highly anticipated vehicle. The first twenty minutes began with Viola Davis's character and her plan on assembling team. During this point, we are given spoon-fed introductions on each villain including their tragic backstory and their paths that lead them to the sadistic criminals they are. Out of all of them, only Harley Quinn and Deadshot's story truly stand out, and their character arcs speak more than volumes; the rest of the gang is left as two-dimensional figures with much more to speculate. The romance and partnership between Harley and The Joker is beautifully told, capturing the true image of the two iconic villains; and the same can said about Deadshot's story of his journey to the darkside and his eagerness to return to his daughter who witnessed the grim change in her father's character. Other than this, the character development remains less than seldom. And the worse part is that the most disappointing character (ironically) happens to be The Joker who is sadly reduced to just only eight minutes of time on screen, making him feel more of a guest character than a true villain of the story. It's quite dispiriting considering the maniacal vibe Jared Leto delivers as the iconic villain. Of course, this performance is far leveling up to what Heath Ledger brought in 'The Dark Knight' or even Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's adaptation. Arguably the most charismatic performance here would Margot Robbie who brings plenty of dark humor and pure insanity as the criminally insane Harley Quinn, and by her side is Will Smith who deliver right on the spot as Deadshot. The rest of the cast including Jai Courtney in what is easily his most charismatic role show off some credible performances, but nothing entirely memorable.As the plot revolves around the team's mission to defeat the Evil Enchantress, it descends into silly incoherent mess that favors a long stretch of visually compelling action sequences with plenty of special effects and explosive visuals to please the eyes, but not enough plot development. Through the antiheroes' battle against constant hordes of monstrous, zombie-like creatures lead by the Evil Enchantress, the story spends a great amount of time going almost nowhere. Don't get me wrong, these sequences are fun as the characters treat us to some clever (and occasionally crude) one-liners and some solid chemistry. After awhile, it's grows a little repetitive. And it certainly doesn't help that the scenes undergo some choppy editing with plenty of scenes cut out by the wishes of Warner Bros studios who wanted the story to go for a more ""humorous"" tone than a less dark approach, despite the fact that the Dark Knight Trilogy (centering on a hero) captured a pretty dark and gritty feel. If you are gonna edit out some scenes, it would probably look better if it wasn't so obvious.Suicide Squad may have the fun and humor to make for a darkly funny ride, but it fails to capture the spirit of it's critically acclaimed source material or bring proper nuance to it's likable villains. In the end, it only further pushes the DC Cinematic Universe away from reaching the road to popular ranks of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",Suicide Squad
139,Troy_Campbell,Entertainingly eccentric.,7,6 August 2016,"The hype surrounding this deranged blockbuster couldn't have been any higher. The casting was bold, director David Ayer promised to bring his off-kilter style to proceedings and the trailers were downright awesome. That it doesn't quite reach the exceedingly lofty heights many were expecting shouldn't come as a shock, however there's enough fun and flair to ensure this demented romp all but wipes away the disappointment that was Batman v Superman. The tremendously enjoyable first act serves as a crazy meet-and-greet – with cool character title cards and all – establishing an excitingly wild tone, although this gradually dampens into something more generic by the bland and uninspired final act. The biggest problem with the last 30 minutes is undoubtedly how rote it feels, the dull CGI villains offering zero thrills and the climactic save-the-world sequence a muddled and dull affair with no ingenuity whatsoever. But what comes before the finale is oh-so-good. It's a rollicking ride of gunfights, swordplay and witty barbs as the titular ragtag group of anti-heroes reluctantly band together to defuse a mystical terrorist attack, or else be killed by the explosive chip implanted in their necks by ruthless government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis hamming it up). An early battle against mindless henchmen culminating in Deadshot (Will Smith) stepping up to single-handedly wipe the horde out is an action-based highlight, closely followed by a daring rooftop escape by Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Speaking of Robbie, she's arguably the standout amongst an overall solid cast, although Smith is as cocky and cool as ever, Jai Courtney is surprisingly excellent as Aussie bank-robber Boomerang and Jay Fernandez is suitably dangerous as walking flamethrower Diablo. The big question though: how does Jared Leto's Joker stack up against past incarnations? His laughing maniac is old-school gangster meets volatile nut-job, an utterly watchable psycho who commands the screen with every sneered line or outrageous cackle. Leto and Robbie share an amazing chemistry on screen, their energetic and erratic relationship – a comic-book version of Bonnie and Clyde if you will – is a ticking time bomb of death and destruction, which is why their limited time together is a crime. Not the mind-blowing film it could've been, but with one of the best soundtracks this side of a Tarantino flick and a wickedly cavalier attitude to accompany a wickedly cavalier group of (bad) good guys, Suicide Squad is an entertainingly eccentric entry into the DC Cinematic Universe.",Suicide Squad
140,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,It's undone some of DC's steps forward with The Dark Knight.,4,19 December 2016,"Suicide Squad, I find, gets worse the more I see it. It just doesn't know what the story it wants to tell really is. Is it end of the world stuff, that villains can be redeemable people, that scum and villainy is still a problem but not as big as we think? Suicide Squad is a fan service machine; and it's a bit cynical with how it thinks it can get away with telling an empty story that's too stuffed with under-cooked characters.DC Comics Entertainment apparently went through a 'great' revision in the aftermath of Dawn of Justice's unexpected cinematic injustice (pun intended); what happened after that shake-up? They panicked about their next project and made it rosie-painted and poorly edited fodder just to fill in time for next year's Justice League movie.I initially gave the film a seven; I can't keep that score because the film keeps getting a little worse every time I re-watch it. Sure there's a good moment here and there like Easter-eggs for longtime fans, but aside from that the film is just... empty. This is a film that just doesn't keep in terms of quality.Suicide Squad fails as a crime film (it isn't one), it's not a well-executed superhero film, and the six-week-executed screenplay is further proof that this film was the victim of franchised tent-poling. The script is so baffling that it makes Batman v Superman's screenplay seem comparable to the works of Robert Towne and Charlie Kaufman. Goodfellas, The Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America: THOSE are REAL CRIME FILMS that any open-minded film-goer may end up appreciating. Suicide Squad ain't those movies; not even close.If you want a film with well-rounded characters respecting your yearning for complexity and maybe subversive sympathy for a bad egg, or even remotely intelligent antiheroes, watch Taxi Driver. Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle is a stronger SINGLE character than the newly introduced TEAM of villains in this film.Suicide Squad: makes me think of the suicide squad from Monty Python's Life of Brian. At least that's a real suicide squad.",Suicide Squad
141,pyrocitor,Caught in a landslide; no escape from banality,4,22 August 2016,"First: 2015's abominable Fantastic Four. Then, 2016's laughable Batman v. Superman. Now, we have Suicide Squad: the latest in a slew of big-budget train wrecks, resulting in an acrid cocktail of the wrong directors being given too much agency coupled with boneheaded, contradictory studio hand-holding. Still, it's hard to strictly call studio interference party foul here, as the film is so inherently muddy it's hard to imagine any iteration successfully coughing itself to life. It's hard to resist a spectral Queen chorus of ""Is this the real life?"" running through your head watching the shambolic mess unspool – Suicide Squad wants desperately to strut, but stumbles on every step, before toppling into the void of being utterly forgettable.We can excuse the embarrassingly gratuitous Justice League tie-ins (hey – at least Ben Affleck's Batman acts somewhat more like Batman, saving villains from certain death rather than branding them in the face). We can **sort of** excuse the flagrant piggybacking plagiarism of Guardians of the Galaxy, from the hyperactive prison montage antihero character bios to the soundtrack, nonsensically cobbled together like a caffeine-high teen with a gift card to the iTunes store (and no, you're not mistaken - that Norman Greenbaum song is yanked straight out of the Guardians trailer. The theft is that blatant). We can even try to excuse director David Ayer's uncomfortable balance between dopey, wannabe slick humour and self-important wannabe 'darkness', even if it mostly manifests in the film's indiscernible, murky lighting (grossly counterbalanced by splotches of colour, like a toddler vomiting play-doh). Still - a film full of villains-turned-antiheroes must bring SOMETHING original to the table. Right?And this is what we can't excuse: Suicide Squad is not only a bird's nest of content and tone, but also a fundamentally trashy, soulless, redundantly small-minded film. It loudly parades some of the worst nonlinear editing and pacing seen in a recent Hollywood film, to the point where its gossamer-thin plot (literally a lazy, boiled down version of The Raid - the entire conflict can be reduced to 'climb the building') becomes almost incomprehensible at times when really nothing is happening. There's so much daft flashiness (yes, including Ezra Miller), sense is thrown to the wind. But, lest we get confused, Ayer is sure to slop in massive exposition dumps every 10-15 minutes, which rudely bring the film to a screeching halt every time it starts to pick up steam. The tiny blips of action are so bland, they fade from consciousness and memory before they've even finished feebly sputtering on. Finally, the glut of action figures-sorry-characters is so unreasonably vast, several Squad members are given no introduction, and literally dispatched within minutes with no send-off. Several are so extraneous they could be trimmed without anyone even noticing (Katana, anyone?). Initially, there's hope for the effectively creepy uber-villains, but, after memorable introductions, they spend the majority of the film sulking in puffs of CGI, waiting for Ayer to remember they exist. Even worse: even some of the most iconic secondary players - Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's iconic Killer Croc, for one - are so underused, they're effectively there to snarl on command, and burp out unfunny ""B.E.T."" punchlines. Ouch. It's even more of a shame, as Ayer does scatter nuggets of genuinely compelling material to grapple with. Peel aware its slathering of smarm and gloom, and Suicide Squad is a film about characters struggling with bad relationships. Smith's Deadshot regrets his daughter being overly permissive of his career as an assassin. Jay Hernandez's Diablo spends the rest of his life owning up to his superpowered tantrum gruesomely murdering his girlfriend and children (the sole flashback which actually works, infusing the film with tragedy, scope, and as sombre a cinematic allegory for domestic abuse as we've seen lately, and Hernandez is unexpectedly moving). And let's not even start on whatever warped, emotionally abusive relationship the Joker and Harley Quinn share. These interludes may not propel the story, but when Ayer allows himself to linger in the darkness, he digs up the film's only real illumination. The film may have been transparently retrofitted to accommodate Will Smith, but he's worth it. Arguably the film's greatest asset, Smith warps his boundless, sassy charisma and badassery into the film's uneasy moral compass, supplying (the film's only) surprisingly compelling emotional arc. Margot Robbie, conversely, hits her marks, and is admittably hampered by an infuriatingly anti-feminist subplot, but there's still an unshakable sense of her performing Harley Quinn rather than getting under her skin. She's oodles of fun, but her crazy is as wobbly and vaguely forced as her accent. Thankfully, Viola Davis is steely perfection as the Machiavellian Amanda Waller, and Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang is funnier and more unpredictable than he has any right to be as such a boorish bogan stereotype. Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flagg is one of the most infuriating military grunts in recent cinematic memory (and this is a generation that survived Aaron Taylor-Johnson in Godzilla). And then there's Jared Leto. Hoo boy. If 'forced' was already a shroud ensconcing the film, his blingy Joker is its bleating fog machine of artifice. He's loud and irritating, but embarrassingly far-removed from appropriate levels of sinister or unhinged, no matter how many rings of knives he lies in or pools of toxic waste he dives into. There's a bit near the end of Suicide Squad where Kinnaman's Flagg, suffering a change of heart, offers the Squad the chance to escape, and live their lives. Cliché dictates they will instead seek redemption, and stay to fight (yawn). Instead, Courtney's Boomerang prances up, and, without a word, jackrabbits out of the room. It's the film's biggest laugh, partially for its unexpectedness, but partially for being the single most sensible move in the entire production. Suicide Squad is a sinking ship, and the fact that all involved didn't follow Boomerang's example (and even he idiotically crawls back – boo), makes the title exquisitely apt. -4/10",Suicide Squad

143,miguelneto-74936,"The worst superhero movie of the year, too disappointing.",5,22 December 2016,"The first time I watched Suicide Squad I had found the movie even cool, but these days I reviewed the movie, and I understood the negative reviews, I still do not think the movie is bad, but it's quite regular, it is, the cast is The most positive point of the film, Will Smith is very well, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis are the best things in the film, both are excellent in their characters, Margot embodies Harley Quinn in an excellent way, in addition to being visually very similar, the Viola Davis is incredible, and it's Amanda Waller from the comics, now let's go to some negative points, Jared Leto as Joker, visually is not as bad as everyone points, more than could be better, could, and Jared Leto no Is the culprit because his character has had a weak performance, but rather a script, since Jared Leto is an excellent actor (Requiem for a Dream, Mr.Nobory and Dallas Buyers Club prove this), Jai Coutney is competent, he is funny And does not compromise the film, the same thing for Joel Kinnaman, Karen Fukuhara and Jay Hernandez, now Cara Delevigne is very bad in this movie, I admit that I do not know much about his work, this is the first movie I see with him , Well, she's very unimpressive, and her villain is not at all interesting, obviously the script is also guilty, more different from the Leto Joker, here you actress does nothing for the character, so Suicide Squad is weak in terms of Villain, the participation of Batman were very good, and makes me more and more excited about his solo film, Ben Affleck does a great job, the direction of Ayer starts very well, the first act of the film is very good, plus the second Is very weak and tiresome, and the third one ends well, is also weak, the script is very weak, has uninteresting dialogues, the movie is also very rushed in some moments, with few explanations, the action scenes are cool, more It's still not what I wanted to see, the make- up of the film is very good, the costumes are excellent, visually the DC Comis expanded universe has not yet disappointed, but that's not enough, Suicide Squad will gain a continuation, I'll twist to give Sure, the more you have to make fewer mistakes, such as making a trailer, where we expect a movie, and the end result is very different, Warner has to stop playing the movies, I hope the Wonder Woman movie and the Harley Quinn and Amanda Waller perform the excellent Margot Robbie and Viola Davis, and the first act of the film is good, but as the film progresses it becomes weak, the villain is Bad, the Joker is badly used, and the script is a disaster, I liked Batman Vs Superman, mainly from its extended version, but Suicide Squad is weak, and has an extended version that does not add anything to the movie, I hope the Warner stops meddling in the movies.

144,areatw,What a let down,4,14 January 2017,"This film was hyped up so much that it was almost inevitable that it wouldn't live up to such high expectations, so I was half prepared to be let down. What I wasn't prepared for was just how shoddy and poor 'Suicide Squad' actually is. The plot is weak and its delivery is messy and at times confusing.Even the action is below what I had expected, which is unacceptable considering what can be done with CGI and special effects in 2016. How can something so hyped, so highly anticipated and with so much potential turn out as lame and underwhelming as this? The film is poor and great actors such as Will Smith are wasted on such disappointing material.I went into this film expecting to be let down, and I was. But it was a hell of a lot worse than I was expecting. 'Suicide Squad' is one of the most overly hyped and hugely disappointing movies of the last few years.",Suicide Squad
145,reddiemurf81,Fun time with plenty of lols,7,26 June 2020,"I honestly do not understand why this movie got all the bad reviews. Can't understand for the life of me. I guess some people want the DCEU to be more like the MCU? To that I ask,, why?!? I would prefer a difference.Now,, do I have a few complaints about this movie,, well yeah. I do have a few,, but I'll get to that later.This movie introduces us to a lot of characters we haven't seen on the big screen - Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Diablo, Capt Boomerang, Katana, and the Enchantress. (If any of those characters have been in a live action movie it's news to me) Will Smith kills it as Deadshot (pun intended). I hope he comes back for the 3rd movie. Margot Robbie was obviously born to play the role of Harley Quinn. She just becomes the character. Kinnaman was great as Rick Flagg, and all the other characters were played good as well.
Davis as Amanda Waller,,, holy crap!!! (No surprise though,, she is an Oscar winning actress) Like Deadshot says in the movie,, she is just a mean, mean lady. Cold as they come!!
Of courrse,, can't leave out Affleck as Batman. He makes a few short appearances. (I was among the group of people who were displeased upon hearing he was cast as Batman in BvS:Dawn of Justice. I did, however, trust Snyder, having seen all of his previous work,, and I was incredibly pleased with Afflecks performance as the Caped Crusader. As a matter of fact,, imo he is the #2 performance of the character(Bale and Keaton are tied for the #1 spot).) Also,, Leto!!! I realize I'm in the minority here,, but I enjoyed Leto's portrayal of Joker,,, and I wanted MORE!!!!!!!!!!
For those who expected more of Ledger's portrayal,, what were you thinking?!? Different universe!!! Also,, why would you want the same thing again?!? Leto did a great job of being over the top weird and crazy! I want to see him again,,,Now onto the complaints,, well, like I said, I wanted more of the Joker. Other than that,, there was one scene towards the end where things are going in slow motion. I like that things are building up to a climax in slow motion,,, it was just a little too slow. Needed to be going a lil bit faster than it was. It's forgivable,, but it still irks me every time I watch the movie.And that's pretty much it.So go watch it!!!!",Suicide Squad

I was totally lost and readying myself to digest just another overpriced pointless Hollyweirdo production of brainless mind-dung...and then Harley Quinn is introduced. For some reason, the writing or directing or whatever - suddenly stuff became more focused and someone kicked in the afterburners. The movie went from video scribble to a targeted action-flick...yay!!! Let me say this, first...I am no comic book junky and usually not impressed with the entire superhero genre. That being said, I have no clue who these characters are, so I needed the intro - no matter how jumpy it seemed. Once the pace picked up and character data injected, I really started to enjoy myself. Personally, I am over-Batman, and Superman...for me...is a now a superhero to avoid. These characters in this presentation are interesting and fun. Not 'Guardians of the Galaxy' fun, but fun none-the-less. Enjoyably unique; well paced, all this propped up by a group of very talented actors. I am not normally a Will Smith fan, but he was outstanding, and Margot Robbie - her 'Harley Quinn' performance was tops. This is one flick definitely worth a peak.",Suicide Squad
149,aciessi,..and I thought my jokes were bad.,4,13 August 2016,"The summer movie season has hedged it's bets on Suicide Squad as being the biggest, baddest film of them all. If ever there was a perfect formula for a summer hit, this was the one. A gritty DC movie, with Margot Robbie, a kick ass soundtrack, and the cinematic return of the Joker.. a character audiences have become entranced with since Heath Ledger's frightening portrayal just shy of a decade ago. It's the kind of film that generates hype and anticipation, even from a non- superhero lover as myself. Hollywood has found an angle to attract almost all audiences to this genre with films like this. I couldn't wait to see it.Suicide Squad, in reality, was an act of brilliant advertising. The film is a hot mess. The plot is entirely incoherent. More than once, I wasn't sure whether to burst out laughing, or sit in silence. I had no idea where this film was coming from. It's funny... at least when the characters want to be.. but Will Smith utters one line during the climax that almost made me fall out of my chair, and I know that wasn't the script's intention. When the film wants to be gritty, it comes across as desperate. Almost clinging to hope that they can capture the same genius as The Dark Knight. The soundtrack is fantastic, but it disappeared after the first act, perhaps they ran out of money to license it.The single worst aspect of the film was the villain, Enchantress. In a movie sold upon gritty DC misfits and the Joker, the film itself centers on a evil voodoo ghost woman thing that shimmies about and creates an army of mutant mud monsters to kill everything in sight, all the while promising the protagonists a false spell that will give them a domesticated family life that they always wanted. Now, If I told you all of this in the months prior to the release of the film, you'd call me insane. But yes, Enchantress makes up about 60% of the film, and you will be as speechless as I was watching this. At one point, I thought I was watching the sequel to Fantastic Four.But are there any positives? Yes, there are. This is far from an unwatchable film. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is a feat of casting genius. She was my favorite part. She is the best portrayal Harley Quinn since Arleen Sorkin voiced her in Batman: The Animated Series. Hilarious, sexy, spunky, badass.. It reminds you why we all love that crazy gal. Jared Leto's Joker is another thing that impressed me. He took the character in a direction that was quite new and quite familiar. To sum it up, it was a combination of Jack Nicholson's grandstanding Joker from the Tim Burton Batman, with Heath Ledger's Joker, plus a tiny hint of Mark Hamill's animated Joker. He's insanely creepy, he never breaks character (much like Ledger), and it works very well. It was a given that he would never in a million years reach the heights of Ledger, but this was a Joker that should be well appreciated for years to come. I suggest, if there ever is a live-acting Killing Joke movie, WHICH THERE TOTALLY SHOULD BE, cast Leto immediately.Other than that, Suicide Squad is a major disappointment. For what we were all expecting, and we were all expecting so much.. maybe this should've been a lesson to all of us.. just don't hype a movie. Scratch that, just don't hype a DC Cinematic Universe movie. You will always be disappointed.",Suicide Squad
150,rockman182,Suicide Squad (2016),5,16 December 2016,"With the Bluray of this film recently released, I decided to give the extended edition a rewatch. My initial thoughts about this film were not great as I thought a lot of the film was a mess. After rewatching the film again, my opinion of the film has not changed all that much. Be warned that this film will have potential spoilers and you should not read on if you don't want parts of the film spoiled.I wouldn't say I'm a huge comic book fan but I do prefer DC to Marvel. I'm mostly a Wonder Woman fan but I want to see Batman films done right as well. While I wasn't a giant detractor of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the film could certainly have been better. I hold out hope that the Justice League film and Wonder Woman film can lift the DC Universe because Suicide Squad sure as hell did not.The first problem I had with the film was the exposition of the squad's back story. Exposition is okay in doses and if its done correctly. This film has an awkward set up of it at a restaurant. The editing throughout the film is frenetic and erratic but its at its worst during the back stories. Also the character exposition is uneven. Deadshot and Harley Quinn get the most time. Its understandable because they are the main faces of the squad but its hard to really know the motivations or anything about the other characters when they have virtually no backstory or interesting element. Why did Captain Boomerang carry a pink unicorn around? Characters like Katana and Killer Croc are barely developed at all. Killer Croc seemed like a walking stereotype with bad lines. Characters are just thrown into this film, Slipknot was so useless and ultimately pointless. A lot of things felt pointless.Initially I thought Will Smith would Will Smith the hell out of this film but he did alright. I am not a fan of Margot Robbie at all but apparently she played a Harley Quinn that was faithful to the comics. Fair enough. I cringed at many 9nearly all) of her lines but maybe that was more a character thing more than a script issue. There is plenty of bad dialogue going around in the film. A lot of it is awkward. Viola Davis is a great Amanda Waller; she always performs well. I am not that big on Jai Courtney in other films but honestly he was alright in this and had a few good moments. I didn't have a problem with Jared Leto's Joker as many others did but I think their criticisms are valid. Heath Ledger's Joker was phenomenal and will never be duplicated, so I applaud Leto for putting a different spin on the role and trying to make it work.Plot progression is uneventful (for lack of a better word). The squad get assembled literally walk a few streets in the night and then they are at the villains location. Its like nothing happened except flashbacks and bits of action here and there. The middle section suffers from a few boring stretches. The villain(s) are not memorable and look too CG'ed. The flashbacks in real time during the boss battle was annoying too. I'm surprised at how bad this is because David Ayer is better than this. Fury and End of Watch were great and gritty war dramas and cop dramas respectively. He's also a good writer so I don't know what went wrong here. Was it the studio involvement that caused this film to be such a mess? This was such a disappointment for DC. The extended scenes don't add enough to make the film a little better. The Diablo reveal bothered me. He burns down the house with his family in it and then in the final battle we see him morph into a fire demon or something. So random and convenient. I would have shown him morph into the demon back in the house when he burned it down, like show a shadow on the wall of it happened just to foreshadow the real monster within him. Did I talk about the soundtrack yet? Yes its a collection of great songs but they are so randomly placed in the film and do not fit the tone of the film at all. The film struggles to really find a tone anyways.I still think this film is a mess and kind of regret buying the Bluray. I may end up selling it because I really don't think it was worth the money or the rewatch. DC better get their act together and deliver on Wonder Woman, that film NEEDS to be good.5/10",Suicide Squad
151,jon.h.ochiai,"Suicide Squad, Boom!",8,13 August 2016,"""Suicide Squad"" is a great time at the movies. Director and Writer David Ayers's ""Suicide Squad"" makes absolutely no sense. That really doesn't matter nor I would guess was it ever the intent. Will Smith is all movie star swag with deceptive nuance. Margot Robbie is brilliant 'oh snap' irony as psycho killer Harley Quinn. Nuance is not the ""Suicide Squad"" strong suit. However, Smith's assassin Deadshot salvages the movie with his paternal gravity. Robbie is a revelation in her brazen self-awareness of Harley's curse —both comic and sad. The movie critics completely misjudged the overall appeal. In a striking battle sequence the charismatic Smith as Deadshot, stands upon a fiery car shooting with Zen-like precision at an army of carbon headed soldiers. Yeah, you have to see the movie. Contrast this with a quiet exchange between him and Robbie's Harley as she genuinely asks, ""You ever been in love?"" He says, ""No. Never."" She knows that's bulls**t. Smith and Robbie refine a lot of Ayers's broad narrative strokes. Ayer sporadically inserts insight amidst the high decibel noise. He could have done more. He benefits from generating strong performances throughout, especially from Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis. Having expendable criminals saving the day has been done before. ""Suicide Squad"" triumphs in that we end up caring about the Suicide Squad, despite being the ""bad guys"". Viola Davis is at her ruthless best as CIA Director Amanda Waller, who proposes assembling the world's most powerful and deadly criminals as protectors in case heroes like Superman go rogue. They are called ""meta-humans"". On the upside, the Government has plausible deniability, and the Suicide Squad is expendable by design. Apparently, this reflects the aftermath of ""Superman vs. Batman"". Having capable Special Forces operatives alone like Rick Flag, played by strong and smart Joel Kinnaman, are insufficient for such a scenario. So it is up to Waller and Flag to recruit the Suicide Squad. Flag brings in guardian executioner Katana (tough Karen Fukuhara), the woman samurai grieving the death of her husband, wielding a magical sword. Fukuhara is good, but expressively handicapped by her mask. The Katana lapse illustrates that there are too many super criminals in ""Suicide Squad"", and not enough back story. Members of the Suicide Squad have heinously killed many people, mostly innocent. So transforming them into heroes is daunting. We see the ripped Deadshot (Smith) punching a bag trying to survive in prison. His daughter is his only reason for taking on this mission. Harley Quinn (Robbie) is an uncontrollable killer, who was turned evil by Batman's nemesis The Joker (creepy charismatic Jared Leto). Quinn is The Joker's lover, and he is the source of her power. The side story has The Joker beholding to her and seeking to get her back. Leto is a harsher version of Heath Ledger's Joker. There is tattooed Diablo (Jay Hernandez), who controls fire. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje) is a creature like his name, whose powers seem to be thrashing and eating people. There are more Squad members—way too many.Ironically, it turns out that the Suicide Squad must stop the Enchantress (lovely and fierce Cara Delevingne), who is archaeologist June Moore. On an excavation site, a powerful ancient deity inhabits Moore. With her god-like powers Enchantress seems omnipotent, and it seems nearly impossible for the Suicide Squad to win. But the odds matter little, much like the story. Once in motion we are enthralled by ""Matrix""-like gun battles, the slick martial arts sequences, and mind bending explosions. ""Suicide Squad"" is visually stunning. Know what to expect with ""Suicide Squad"". Admire its unpretentiousness, and enjoy the wild ride. Smith and Robbie's star power and nuance make up for a lot. ""Suicide Squad"" is a fun summer movie.",Suicide Squad

After all, sometimes the greatest art can stand apart from the artists who create it. Decades from now, most will have forgotten the controversy, resorting to Wikipedia for a reminder.In the realm of superhero films, the motif has always been a dichotomy of extremes. Good vs. evil. In reality, things aren't nearly as clear-cut as this. Sure, there are those who do wrong and those who do right, but each side will have their own motivations. What Suicide Squad does is break down the stereotype of the villain. No longer are they purely the psychotic mayhem-inducing individuals who seek world domination. Through this film, we see that the driving force behind these villains is plain and simple. Human, even. It's love. Love drives Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) to endure the Joker's abusive relationship. Love motivates Deadshot (Will Smith) to do whatever it takes to see his daughter. They are human, flaws and all.Now, I do agree that the plot was confusing at times and the objectives of the team didn't usually make sense, but perhaps the biggest weakness of this film was due to the number of characters. With a two-hour runtime, it's difficult to get into the full backstory of everyone in the Squad. It's clear that Deadshot and Harley Quinn are the stars of the show, but there are a few surprises, especially with El Diablo (Jay Hernandez). In an Avengers-esque film like this one, it would have been nice to give each villain their own standalone film before bringing them together, so I suppose we'll just have to wait for any sequels to flesh out the other characters instead.A good balance to hero-centric films like The Avengers and Justice League, I give Suicide Squad 3.0 stars out of 5.",Suicide Squad
154,khanbaliq2,"Suicide Squad delivers a solid two hours of aesthetically pleasing, superpowered action that's just plain fun to watch.",6,18 March 2017,"There are currently two serious, mind-boggling questions that need to be answered. First, why did John Flickster watch Fifty Shades Of Black (2016)? Second, why isn't Justin Bieber on display in some zoo? By the way, I like watching some of John Flickster's movie reviews. He has a good channel. Anyway, I watched Suicide Squad (2016) some time ago, and I was somewhat surprised by it. Warner Bros. Pictures is in the process of creating its own so-called cinematic universe with DC Comics superheroes. This decision was influenced by the money-making success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So, like any other large entertainment company without an original idea, Warner Bros. Pictures wants to get in on the action. Some people might say that the company is not off to a good start. They're right. But I still like some things in the movies that Warner Bros. Pictures has released so far. These movies are Man Of Steel (2013), Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016). On the one hand, these movies are dumb, unoriginal, violent and depressing pieces of Hollywood garbage. On the other hand, there are some good ideas in these movies. Also, the acting is good in places, the special effects are good, and, for example, the people that worked on hair and make-up for Suicide Squad deserved winning an Oscar. But this is what one would expect from Warner Bros, which is a major Hollywood studio. I mean, you can't expect a movie with a budget of almost $200 million to be garbage on all levels. Still, because of the problems that I've mentioned, I'm not going to go around and say that I like Suicide Squad or Man Of Steel. Seriously, how can you like a movie in which ships look like johnsons? That's really too bad because I like some other things in Man Of Steel, like the special effects and the designs. Unfortunately, I will never say that I like Man Of Steel because it's depressing, because the characters are not interesting, and because Zack Snyder seems to have an obsession with phallus symbolism in all of his movies. Does anyone remember 300, which was released in 2006? Thanks to that movie, we've learned that soldiers in Ancient Greece spent a lot of time working out in American gyms. Maybe the Persians should have bought passes to American gyms too. Suicide Squad is an entertaining movie. I probably enjoyed watching it more than I enjoyed watching Man Of Steel. Still, like Man Of Steel, Suicide Squad is weighed down by some of the same problems, and it is, first of all, a Hollywood product. I feel the same way about Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith. I remember watching this movie in a theatre. It's when I was still going to high school. I watched it in the same theatre in which I watched Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence. It was summer. The auditorium was full of people. There were many children. I remember being entertained by Revenge Of The Sith. It was quite a spectacle on the big screen. It's one of my most memorable theatre going experiences. But now, of course, I know that it's not such a good movie. It has some problems, to say the least. Watching it in a theatre, however, was quite something. There have been so many movies about superheroes in the last decade that there have been talks about superhero movie fatigue, as if people are tired of watching movies about superheroes. Well, I certainly don't have this fatigue. Other people don't have this fatigue too because these movies are still very profitable. If they're done well, they will certainly make a lot of money. Though I have the feeling that Hollywood keeps making these movies not just for profits. It seems to me that these movies have a certain social message, especially movies about teams of superheroes. I think that the concept of superheroes and supervillains in Western society goes back to feudalism and to knights. So much Western literature is about super heroes and super villains. So, Sherlock Holmes just had to be a super detective and Professor Moriarty just had to be a super criminal. This concept of individualism is present in the art and literature of few other cultures.",Suicide Squad
155,RforFilm,"A laughing matter it is not. Suicide Squad has some colorful baddies, but gives little for them to do",5,10 August 2016,"Disney seems to have the market down on superhero movies ever since they bought Marvel. With the numerous Iron Man, Captain America, and Avengers movies, mostly all receiving positive phrase from critics and audiences, how is it that the idea of a cinematic universe is so hard to do in another fashion. Disney is about to do the same with the Star Wars stories, and yet Warner Brothers seems to be having trouble with the DC comics' stories. Man of Steel started with a well- intended Superman, but fell due to story issues and regard with simple logic. Batman V Superman made even bigger mistakes when it tried to combine five or six movie ideas into one. One of the biggest problems is that director Zack Snyder had set up those previous film as so dark and brooding, that they lack much fun. The action scenes are good, but both movies had an identity crisis of it's own by not knowing how take it's dark tone and make it more fun. Warner Brothers was smart enough to understand just how colorful the villains are. Batman, Superman, The Flash, and the rest of the Justice League are full of baddies that have worked with each other in the comics. Suicide Squad seems like a proper step to take to try and give DC fans something different. Set after the events of Batman V Superman, intelligence operative Amanda Walker (played by Viola Davis) is worried that the next ""Superman"" being could be a force of evil rather then good. Knowing that most military would not be a match for powerful beings, she proposes a team of villain and criminals to be used as a disposable asset in high risk missions. When an archaeologist Dr. June Moone (played by Cara Delevingne) becomes possessed by a witch called the ""Enchantress"" and sets on destroying the world, the team is brought out of the prison and into the streets.This Suicide Squad consists of assassin/marksmen Deadshot (played by Will Smith), crazy Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie), mouthy Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), pacifist but fiery El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez), cannibalistic Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and sword wielding Katana (played by Karen Fukuhara). Their all being led by Army officer Rick Flag as they make their way closer into the center of the city to stop the Enchantress. If that wasn't enough, the Joker (played by Jared Leto) is coming in to take Harley Quinn back to Gotham. The good news is that Suicide Squad is better then Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. The bad news is that it's not by much. I'll say that I'm glad the this DC movie finally tried to evoke more fun into it's universe. That idea shows a lot within it's players. The best here are Will Smith and Margot Robbie who sport out the best one liners and really embrace the insanity that I wanted more of. Jai Courtney actually found a role that works to his advantage. Viola Davis does well with the material given. Jared Leto manages to bring a new and unique Joker, though we see very little of him.I liked the team and the movie does a fine job setting things up in the first thirty minutes. What Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel's equivalent to this) got right was they allowed their party members to go nuts and interact with each other. There's not much of that in Suicide Squad as the dialogue between each player is minimal in favor of action scenes that are alright, but nothing to brag about. One of the bigger problems is that the villain is incredibly bland and uninteresting. With the talent available, why couldn't these guys be fighting Joker? The Enchantress gives little more then ""I'm Evil!"". Warner Brothers may have the bad guys ready to go, but the story doesn't give them a place exciting to go. I'll give this five Harley Quinn mallets out of ten. If Warner Brothers expects a big cinematic universe with the DC characters, they really need to make some management changes to those behind this creatively. These are good ideas, but they need more madness then what Suicide Squad has to offer. A laughing matter this is not.",Suicide Squad
156,Holt344,"Wrong choice of villain but a good live-action adaption, too bad we won't see Ayer's cut",6,9 December 2018,"This is my third time watching this movie, second with the extended cut and I like it but the story and villain are lacking, Enchantress is cool and all but for a Suicide Squad movie it doesn't work, should have been for a Justice League Dark movie. Deathstroke, Vandal Savage or Joker should have been the villain.The characters are well cast, great and well introduced. Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman is pure perfection. The tattoos is the only bad thing about Harley Quinn. Jared Leto could have been good as the Joker but the look of him and such isn't the Joker for me and some of the dialogue and mannerisms isn't right. The small screen time Ben Affleck had was wonderful and some serious throwback to the Animated Series with the gadgets and such.The soundtrack, costumes, props and makeup are top notch. Too bad the studio make all the changes to David Ayer's version, they rewrote and reshot the last third, also making the editing and pacing really bad. So at the end of things, the writing aren't very good and neither are some of the character arcs.This part of the review was edited on the 4th of August 2021. David Ayer is a great director and it's sad to see his version of the film being taken away like Zack Snyder with Justice League. I'm all about The Ayer's Cut and hope we get to see it sometime in the future, from everything he have said about his version up to this date it sounds like a completely different movie. A version we as fans deserve to see and experience. I'll admit though, the version we got would have been better if they had released 6 months later so they could shoot new scenes and make it better but instead it was edited very very badly.",Suicide Squad

158,juliankennedy23,Suicide is never the answer,6,8 January 2017,"What a mess. Decent performances by Will Smith and Margot Robbie fight against this chopped up train wreck. In the end it is passable entertainment but it certainly isn't what was meant by the filmmakers. Way too many characters almost all of which are criminally underdeveloped. The so called bad guys actually never do anything worse than say the Avengers would which takes away from the entire premise. The tone is all over the place. This was clearly a different movie originally before a panicked DC Universe chopped it up trying to make it more Guardians of the Galaxy. The Joker is half in and half out and Jared Leto becomes a decent scapegoat for what went wrong, but substituting him halfway through for a 90's villain that looks like he came out of a Street Fighter film is not an improvement.The movie suffers from both attention deficit disorder as being a showcase for the crimes against show don't tell. The movie tells us Rick Flag is in love with June Moone / Enchantress a silly device much of the plot rests on and yet Cara Delevingne and Joel Kinnaman have zero chemistry in their scenes together. Harley Quinn and Batman have a more convincing relationship in this movie, Watchable in a turn your mind off kind of way. Just don't think what could or even should have been.",Suicide Squad
159,Anurag-Shetty,A really strong & unique follow-up to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.,10,6 August 2016,"Suicide Squad tells the story of a group of really bad people forced to save the world. A covert government agency run by Amanda Waller(Viola Davis), wants to recruit the most despicable people, for their incredible abilities & skill sets. Waller will use these group of people to take down otherworldly threats. She brings together a particular group of people including, Deadshot(Will Smith), Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), Boomerang(Jai Courtney), Diablo(Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc(Adewale Akkinuoye-Agbaje), June Moone/Enchantress(Cara Delevingne), Katana(Karen Fukuhara) & Slipknot(Adam Beach). These bad guys are monitored in the field by American soldier, Rick Flag(Joel Kinnaman). If these group of people complete their mission successfully, they will get a reduction in their prison sentences. However if they fail, they will be thrown under the bus & the government will blame them for all the chaos. Suicide Squad is a mind blowing film. I really cannot comprehend why the critics detest this movie so much. Except for one or two teeny tiny flaws, this film is an incredibly fun experience on the big screen. It is hilarious. This is how it successfully separates itself, from the generally dark tone of Man of Steel(2013) & Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016). These two, are the previous movies set in the DC Extended Universe. The action sequences are visually, a delight to watch. The visual effects are excellent. All the CGI-rendered sequences look flawless. The 3D has been put to fantastic use, throughout the movie. One minor flaw in this film is that, all the action set pieces involve big explosions, monsters, swords, guns & what not but, there are barely any hand-to-hand fight scenes. Another slightly more significant flaw, is the lack of screen time for Jared Leto's Joker. Apart from my nitpicking, this movie is crazy & weird, in a good way! Director David Ayer has masterfully introduced these relatively unknown team of super villains, to the world at large. The climactic set piece & the brief origin stories of all the characters, are some of the highlights of the film. The performances of this star-studded ensemble, is another highlight of the movie. Will Smith is spectacular as Deadshot. Smith showcases many subtle nuances of his bad-ass character. Jared Leto is awe-inspiring as The Joker. I still prefer the late Heath Ledger's now iconic portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime but, Leto takes his portrayal in a completely different direction & owns it. I really hope The Joker has a significant role in the upcoming solo Batman movie. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Harley Quinn. Robbie doesn't just portray Harley Quinn, she becomes Harley Quinn. I am overjoyed that this fan-favorite character finally made her big screen debut & Margot Robbie does not disappoint. Viola Davis is brilliant as Amanda Waller. Joel Kinnaman is perfect as Rick Flag. Jai Courtney is hysterical as Boomerang. Jay Hernandez is amazing as Diablo. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is hilarious as Killer Croc. Cara Delevingne is awesome as June Moone/Enchantress. Karen Fukuhara is incredible as Katana. The supporting cast is impressive. Watch out for unforgettable cameos. Suicide Squad is a must watch for all movie buffs. Seriously, the critics are out of their minds. Go, have a blast!",Suicide Squad

161,fernandoschiavi,David Ayer does not find a tone for his film and is content with the more bureaucratic solutions of the genre,6,2 May 2020,"After Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy and new versions of the Dark Knight and Superman himself in Zack Snyder's films, it's time to be introduced to humanitys most feared villains, the worst of the worst, the 'Suicide Squad'. Being the third film in the Extended Universe DC, it is written and directed by David Ayer, responsible for directing the excellent Fury (2014) and Harsh Times (2005) and for scripting the also great Training Day (2001).
In this storyline, after Superman's death, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) brings together Task Force X, a team of dangerous criminals trapped in Belle Reve prison, consisting of the elite hired killer Pistoleiro (Will Smith), from the former Harlequin psychiatrist (Margot Robbie), former pyrokinetic gangster El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), opportunistic thief and alcoholic Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), genetically modified Crocodile (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and specialized killer Amarra (Adam Beach). They are placed under the command of Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) to be used in high-risk missions for the United States government. Each member has a bomb implanted in the neck, designed to detonate if any member rebels or tries to escape.
Ayer's script wastes no time and has been concerned from the beginning with presenting the criminal record of each of the criminals to the audience through Amanda Waller's explanation. We know that the Gunman is the most wanted hired killer in the world, but that he has his greatest vulnerability in his daughter. The Harley Quinn appears as the former psychiatrist of the Joker in jail, with whom she ended up falling in love and having an insane relationship. She was complicit in the murder of Robin by the Joker - suggested earlier in 'Batman vs Superman' - and being as beautiful as she is unpredictable. Captain Boomerang is presented as one of the greatest thieves in the world and does not know how to work as a team. El Diablo thought he was the king of the world, no one said no to him, until a family tragedy caused him to be consumed in guilt and decided to surrender to the police. Crocodile, a genetically modified being, is an experienced cannibal and fighter. And then there is The Magic (Cara Delevingne), the archaeologist June Moone, who fell into a cave by accident and found something she shouldn't have, giving rise to the most powerful meta-human known. In addition to being able to do almost anything through her magic, she is able to teleport, self-regenerate and fly. Her list of powers is almost endless.
The first quarter of the film is interesting because it shows a little of the squad's criminals at work in the past, showing their supernatural abilities or not, and it also shows some of the affective bonds of some of them. It is also revealed that the Gunman, the Crocodile and the Harlequin are captured by Batman (Ben Affleck, in a cameo), and that Captain Boomerang was arrested by the Flash (Ezra Miller). These small participations, together with those already shown in 'Batman vs Superman', serve to glimpse the future Justice League film, which will include the participation of the entire superhero team.
From the presentation of each one and showing the ties that they have with the heroes of the Justice League, the script starts to focus exclusively on the development of these characters and this is where the greatest deficiencies of history are clear. Since we are talking about villains / criminals, it was necessary for the public to create a certain empathy for these characters so that they would have a certain audience audience. With such serious flaws in the development of the story, it turns out that the audience does not empathize with virtually any character. There is no evidence on the scene that these guys are as bad as what is written in the comics.The one that wins the most dramatic arc is the Gunman of Will Smith, evident consequence of the actor's contract, who always asks for a certain time on screen, in addition to the position of protagonist, who, yes, ends up assuming within the feature with a background story involving his daughter who loves him even though he knows he does bad things. Your character was very well built and works as the link between all the elements of the Squad. Another highlight is Viola Davis, who creates an unscrupulous Amanda Waller, who does justice to the strength that the character has in the comics. Another one that is one of the great successes of the film is the Harlequin of Margot Robbie, which has an intrinsic sensuality (in fact, several scenes are keen to highlight the body of the actress), and which has some good jokes in her psychotic personality, end up yielding some of the best moments of the feature, except when she participates in embarrassing romantic moments with Jared Leto's Joker.
In fact, the Joker is a case in point, with possibly a meager fifteen minutes of scene in the entire film, the character is more irritated than it proves to be threatening. If Heath Ledger composed a cold killer, full of believable and terrifying tics, Jared Leto is nothing more than a decoy with his green dyed hair and his fake laugh. The device villain's make-up on his teeth and barely explored teeth, with his more underground 'gansta' style and crime lord on Gotham's streets disappoint. It is known that several scenes with the Joker were cut from the final edition of the film, which could improve the general perception about the character. However, in 'Suicide Squad', the Joker does not play opposite another great figure besides the Harlequin. In his quick appearances, he is neither a member of the squad nor an opponent of the team. It serves as the Harlequin's romantic (and unjustified) interest. And like the other characters in the film, it's not clear whether Ayer's idea was to sew Harley Quinn's motivations or exploit his sick dependence on the crime clown. In both cases, it fails miserably. If we removed all the scenes from the Joker from the film, the plot would have no narrative damage.
Most frustrating of all is the feeling of an opportunity that has been misused. The idea of the characters being connected and creating greater bonds as the missions were executed, is well-intentioned, but the missions (in fact a mission) do not prove to be the most threatening and cause an inevitable anticlimax. The plot only gains a little more rhythm in the final half hour, in which the group has to face the sorceress Magic, who, like her brother, are defeated with extreme ease and without the group actually acting together. Generic action scenes without twists and an unmotivated threat take all the little dramatic burden built up to that point. Quick editing does not let any character development happen. A scene was soon cut without ceremony.
It is important to highlight that the soundtrack is one of the great points. The composer Steven Price does his best to bring urgency to the film combined with music tracks ranging from Panic! at the Disco, Kehlani, Leslie Gore, Rick James, even Kevin Gates, Twenty One Pilots among others. Although not as efficient as the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' soundtrack, it is an eclectic soundtrack and well used for every situation shown on the screen.
Trying to incorporate some factors of the success of 'Deadpool', released shortly before in theaters, the studio requested that reshoots happen, trying to make the final result less serious, but badly written and loose jokes are always lost within a plot that it tries to bring a considerable level of seriousness. We have a mix of tone and rhythm caused also due to these reshoots and later insertions, which greatly prejudices the final result. The feeling is that once again DC Comics misses the opportunity to build an eloquent script that highlights the dark universe of its characters. In contrast to Marvel's colorful portfolio, DC has in its hands an entire pool of tormented heroes and villains who have been exploited much more efficiently in the past. David Ayer had the potential to oxygenate superhero films, with handpicked characters from Batman's excellent villain gallery, but David Ayer does not find a tone for his film and is content with the more bureaucratic solutions of the genre.",Suicide Squad

Ostensibly led by Deadshot (Will Smith), our Motley Crew is out there being as crazed and violent, with the added difference that they are out to save our ass too.Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) steals the show as the crazed Joker obsessed femme fatal. The Joker is played by Jared Leto in a very original and different way to any other interpretation I've ever seen before, some like it but many others just didn't warm to it.The filming is dark, the story lines are very near-knuckle and the humour is slapped on thick. It's a dark side movie.I think many have to give DC movies a bit more a chance. If you want simple then go to Marvel. DC comic movies are often darker and heavier.

167,swilliky,A mediocre super-villain team-up film,5,4 August 2016,"DC Films adds to the extended comic universe with supervillains, in this shallow action film stuffed full of characters but short on plot. The movie isn't as terrible as the pro critics made it out to be, it's just nothing special that the hype at first made it out to be. It rests somewhere in the middle of superhero films, not joining Deadpool in the subversive revelry, but not as serious a Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to make it dull and long. It moves along quickly but this doesn't allow viewers to know any of the characters and hardly lets these meta- humans show off their powers. Will Smith carries the film bringing the brightest star power as Deadshot. Margot Robbie is right behind him laughing and spouting off with a strange New Yorker accent that came off kind of weird. Harley Quinn will be one to watch but her relationship with the Joker (Jared Leto) didn't show much chemistry. The rest of the team is regulated for the background, but Viola Davis takes on the lead role as no-nonsense Amanda Waller, though she doesn't make that much of an impression as she could have. The film jumps from scene to scene pushing a villain that looks like an outtake from Gods of Egypt and Cara Delevingne as the archaeologist June Moon possessed by the Enchantress, who starts off looking cool as a horror movie monster but gets washed over with shoddy special effects.The rest of the team leave something to look forward to if they make a sequel like Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). Slipknot (Adam Beach) is hardly worth mentioning as a disposable character. Diablo (Jay Hernandez) does have some shining moment, but it's short lived. Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) is the loyal soldier, but his romantic involvement with Moon falls flat as the attempt of emotion in this story.

169,bryank-04844,'Suicide Squad' commits suicide.,3,23 January 2017,"There seems to be a good movie hidden somewhere in 'Suicide Squad', but the film itself makes it nearly impossible for you to find where those good moments are. The film is its own worst enemy, because it promises something new and fresh in the first dozen or so minutes, but then nose dives into the mountain from there on out. This is certainly writer/director David Ayer's most ambitious project and I can't tell if it's his mistake or the collection of DC/Warner Bros. executives who forced the notes on him to make this film not succeed, because again, the first part of the movie gathers your hopes up for something fun. Ayer wrote 'Training Day' and 'U-571', then transitioned into directing with 'End of Watch' and 'Fury', which were both new and fresh takes on tired genres. I was hoping that Ayer could breathe new life and put the DC Comic movie franchise on the right track, but alas, that is not the case.That being said, this is a tiny fraction better than 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', but again, that's not saying much either. I still think one of the worst films in the comic book realm was the recent 'Fantastic Four' remake. That movie on a whole was just terrible on every possible level. It was the worst movie of the year for me. Nothing worked on that film. Here with 'Suicide Squad', Ayer and Warner Bros. had all of the perfect parts to make a great movie, but somewhere in post-production, everything was lost, which makes me just more disappointed in 'Suicide Squad', because they had a ton going for it, but missed the mark, seemingly on purpose. This concept is nothing new with having a team of ""bad guys"" unite to fight something worse for the greater good. Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' paved the way for this genre, which in turn gave birth to this sub genre that spawned 'The Magnificent Seven' all the way to Marvel's 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.Those films worked on every level of entertainment and filmmaking, where 'Suicide Squad' falls short on almost every account, whether it be the horrendous and cringe worthy dialogue throughout the whole movie, the unbelievably awful plot and relationships that are just flat out silly, to the vast amount of characters who never get any screen time other than a couple of shots of action. It was all a disappointment. Since most people won't know who or what the 'Suicide Squad' is other than big comic book fans with the exception of The Joker (Jared Leto) and maybe Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) , the first part of the film introduces us to all of the characters in a roll call style montage, each with their own flashback of their skill-set, arrest, and pop song. Sometimes, we are introduced to the characters twice, which didn't make sense.Like the trailer, Ayer filmed these biographical sequences with the use of those neon color schemes and the right amount of fun and explosiveness that promised something different that took us out of the dreary, dark, and moody DC universe, but as soon as this segment was over, it was back to dark and brooding in a dilapidated city of no color or even citizens walking around. The characters themselves are all great and have their individuality, but it never goes as far as that really. Sure Deadshot (Will Smith) shows that not only is he the world's deadliest assassin and has a chip on his shoulder in the form of Batman (Ben Affleck), but that he is willing to do anything for his 11 year old daughter, including to show her that he is not a ""bad guy"". That sounds good on paper, but the execution and dialogue is covered in smelly cheese throughout and never really investigates any of this.Jay Hernandez's character El Diablo probably has one of the better backstories, as his power is basically that of the Human Torch, but has now doesn't use his fire power anymore, due to an accident with his family long ago. Again, this wasn't explored as well as it should have been, and instead, we got awful dialogue and a terrible flashback that ended in that dreaded camera shot panning upwards with the character looking up at the camera, screaming, ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"". Another big problem with the film was the villain, who resembled a terrible looking Zuul from 'Ghostbusters'. The problem here is that the evil or ""villain"" part is never explained as to why or what it is, but is rather just thrown in there with the tired use of the sky opening up and everybody and everything being sucked up into the sky. This villain is known as The Enchantress and is basically a witch with powers who in turn has a romantic relationship with the military leader named Flag (Joel Kinnaman).Again, she just owns this character from top to bottom. Her inner chaos and craziness is as good as her softer human side and you can tell she just wants to be accepted in some form or fashion. I'm glad she's getting her own film. Killer Croc's makeup is fantastic, but is only given some throwaway jokes here and there. In fact, the film had some reshoots to make the film funnier due to the backlash on 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', but it was done in such a lazy manner that you can easily tell where they added the worst and cringe worthy dialogue in to try and make it ""funny"", which it wasn't. Other characters show up out of nowhere and never have anything to do but have some special skill that is never fully utilized or sought out. 'Suicide Squad' promises something good and different in its opening minutes, but then falls flat on its face and never recovers.WAIT FOR NETFLIX!",Suicide Squad

171,vampire_hounddog,Kiss ass - DC style,5,31 July 2020,"A ruthless US government covert operations specialist (Viola Davis) comes up with the wild idea of putting together a team of super villains to take on an evil ancient witch (Cara Delevingne) and The Joker (Jared Leto) who have laid waste to Chicago. Those after them are a bunch of dangerous hombres, especially Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) who used to be The Joker's lover.The DC universe directly challenges Marvel's AVENGERS universe here and is much more violent in the process. The action is well handled by talented director David Ayer, better known for his corrupt cop dramas, as the writer for TRAINING DAY (2001) and directing and writing STREET KINGS (2008) and END OF WATCH (2013), but handles the violence well here. Davis too is chilling in her matter of fact, cool and frankly very ordinary character. Meanwhile, Robbie's Harley Quinn is sexy, wild and gives off a good deal of energy and wit, while Will Smith's assassin centres the film and the characters. Leto as a punk ass Joker is simply irritating and the less screen time he has the better.",Suicide Squad
172,katyayan-12892,Suicide squad,3,3 April 2021,"Review By Kamal KThe task of bringing this DC Entertainment comic book story to life is on the shoulders of writer/director David Ayer. Within the first 15 minutes, it's obvious that something is off. The film doesn't start with a killer action scene that draws you in. It gets stuck in a dull parade of flashback backstories for each of the characters.As the action scenes do come into view, none are well-shot, choreographed or out-of-this-world sci-fi crazy.Hard to believe that Steven Price, Oscar-winner for the beautifully scored Gravity is responsible for the background music that sounds like it's from the Macy's Day Parade. The pacing and editing are tolerable (John Gilroy, Nightcrawler) and neither help or hinder.U. S. Intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who runs a clandestine ops org named A. R. G. U. S., is trying to lead the charge against an alien super power that is threatening her city and the world. Her strategy is to fight evil with evil by enlisting the aid of hardcore super villains who are languishing in the Belle Reve Federal Penitentiary and desperate for freedom. Says Waller: ""I've finally got the worst of the worst."" She dubs them ""Meta-Humans.""She assigns military commander Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman, Robocop) to lead the mission. He brings a Samurai warrior woman named Katana (Karen Fukuhara,) along.The criminals who will form the A-Team militia are: Deadshot (Will Smith), an assassin in solitary confinement who was captured and arrested by none other than Batman (Ben Affleck, and seeing him is a buzzkill). Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, The Legend of Tarzan and Fury) was once a psychiatrist who had a very famous patient, The Joker (Jared Leto). She let the fiend get the better of her and she now has amazing agility, fighting powers and a bad girl attitude.Slipknot (Adam Beach, Flags of Our Fathers) is a master escape artist. Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney, Divergent) is a buffed and muscular Aussie robber. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Pompeii) is a beast with an amphibians' face. The group is rounded out with the very enigmatic and troubled Diablo (Jay Hernandez, Bad Moms) a fire starter.Unlike the Avengers or X-Men movies, where some moviegoers will be familiar with the heroes or antiheroes, this film brings a whole new set of characters to the screen that only hardcore DC comic book readers would know. The viewer is forced to meet, greet and hear the history of each, and it's a lot to ask. What's even more challenging is that none of the Suicide Squad participants have powers that are all that magical. If they really had a lot of mojo, they wouldn't spend so much time in long drawn-out and often boring fight scenes. They'd be able to annihilate their adversaries, in seconds.Though the cast members put their hearts and souls into their performances, none of their portrayals resonate and all have done better jobs in other films or TV shows.That's a further reflection on the unimaginative direction and a feeble script that never puts them in the right light or makes their characters worth watching. Given the right material, some in the cast are fully capable of handing in Oscar-worthy performances. They've done it before.As the film grinds to its cataclysmic ending (think Ghostbusters, the new one), and the witch is casting spells and fighting the squad with all the deadliness of a Miss America contestant, the scenes become less plausible, less likable, more preposterous and mundane. It's enough to drive you crazy with contempt as you think of what might have been. This is a wasted opportunity on so many levels.",Suicide Squad
173,Carycomic,"Blows STAR TREK BEYOND, JASON BOURNE, and GHOSTBUSTERS 2016 out of the water!",10,4 August 2016,"Okay; now that I've got your attention, let's get down to the nitty- gritty. For those of you who aren't overgrown fan boys and girls, this film is loosely based on a DC comic that first started publishing in the 1980's. The concept no doubt having been inspired by the enduring popularity of THE DIRTY DOZEN. But, with the reluctant recruits being modern super-villains rather than court- martialed American GI's during World War II!The plot of this movie is likewise from the 1980's. More specifically; it's loosely based on the Succubus/Incubus story arc involving the magical anti-superheroine called the Enchantress. As originally depicted in DC Comics, in the late Sixties, she was as magical as Zatanna...and yet dressed like Mrs. Peel. But, by the Seventies, that had all changed. Perhaps because non-DC readers kept confusing her with the Asgardian super-villainess of the same name over at Marvel.In short; she was the first DC do-gooder to go bad. And all before ""Crisis On Infinite Earths!""This 21st century film version goes one step further. It not only updates the character of June Moone into a former archaeologist (a la Indiana Jones). It consolidates the Silver Age origin of her character with both the post-COIE revision and La Encantadora (the Latina revamp that was created in the late Nineties)! Then, we have Jared Leto's Joker. No purple tuxedo for this dude! He's performed just the way Frank Miller depicted him in that now-classic graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns."" Basically, a sociopathic albino Goth who just might laugh both ways (if you catch my drift). And, as blasphemous as this might sound? I find that take on the character even scarier than Heath Leger's posthumous Oscar-winning portrayal!Other than these two alterations (plus, the Afro-Americanizing of Deadshot by having him portrayed--almost too convincingly--by Will Smith), the movie stays pretty close to the basic premise of the original comic. For the most part, however, this is a straight-up sequel to BvS: DAWN OF JUSTICE. Which, as I noted in my review for that film, was inspired by both the Frank Miller epic and the introductory ""Doomsday"" story arc in Superman's comics (in the early Nineties).Need I add that Margot Robbie practically steals the show as Harley Quinn? I thought not. Go and enjoy.",Suicide Squad

I did not watch all of the movie, but I had someone at work who had watched all of this sh*t movie twice, tell me what happens. I feel like that qualifies me as having seen Suicide Squad. Also Harley Quinn's backstory came off as a little rapey. Like David Ayer could have just written the Harley Quinn character as always subconsciously attracted to the Joker, but instead he wrote it so it reads as though the Joker has Harley gang raped into submission. Why write it that way? How is that better? Oh yeah, directing sucks acting sucks movie was written for sh*t, Suicide Squad officially reviewed.",Suicide Squad
175,DarthVoorhees,The first DC Universe film to hit mediocre.,5,10 August 2016,'The Suicide Squad' has arrived after much hype and that hype should have been something of a warning sign. It is by far the best comic book movie this summer but that isn't saying much as I hated 'Batman V. Superman' and 'Captain America Civil War'. I have the standard complaints. It is a movie that shows tremendous signs of 'Avengers' envy and as such it has a lot of the crippling faults facing pretty much all comic book movies. The good news is that sprinkled within 'Suicide Squad's comic book monotony are some inspired characters and build ups. It allows 'Suicide Squad' to hit mediocre to okay. That is a feat 'Batman v. Superman' really couldn't do in it's wildest dreams.I feel as if I have to explore the faults because they are numerous. 'Suicide Squad' is way too crowded a movie especially since we are being introduced to all these characters for the first time. Some of these characters receive no lines at all. The film should have reduced it's main cast to four. It might have saved it's coherence. They can't even fit in proper introductions for everyone. Katana's character just jumps in before the flight to the war zone. This is putting selling toys and sequels ahead of creating a fully realized story this time around.'Suicide Squad' is also visually uninteresting as it tries to continue the dark supposedly gritty color palette of 'Batman v. Superman'. You can be dark without literally being dark.The beginning exposition though is absolutely fantastic. Viola Davis gives the best performance in a comic book film in years. Amanda Waller is more interesting than Harley Quinn or the Joker. Honestly the movie would have been far more biting had the entire thing cast her as the main character putting the team together. Once the action starts it gets repetitive. I hate endless faceless armies in these films and that unfortunately is what the majority of 'Suicide Squad' ends up being. (Also Jared Leto is awful in it. He's doing an over-the-top Heath Ledger.)I'd mildly recommend it for comic book completists. If you don't like comic book movies I'd say stay away. It won't do anything for you,Suicide Squad
176,lark40,giving a redemption a shot it would be an honor among thieves till suicide do us part lets go crazy for the witch,8,17 August 2016,"This film is a kind of sequel to superman vs batman Suicide Squad is jam-packed with action, star power and mayhem, with director David ayer who likes his gritty action films like training day and fury he combines his film into 2h 3mins Min's of frenetic | Action, Adventure, Comedy so we see this is a follow up to batman vs superman the world thinks superman is dead and the world powers believe this and there worried who might take his place with meta humans getting powerful they wonder who they can turn to or control so they wont run so we see the government agents putting together a team and we get to see backstories of all the main characters like a brilliant on form and comical but has a heart but turned bad Will Smith ... Deadshot Will Smith portrays Deadshot and the costume for the character and all of his weapons will have written on them the phrase ""I am the Light, the Way"", an obvious reference to Jesus. his daughter is his heart but this plays on his mind with Bruce Wayne's batman having a vital cameo appearance getting to grips with two characters he might be able to control he batman is doing a tony stark for the justice league we have jokers girlfriend on the side Margot Robbie ... Harley Quinn and her trusty baseball bat she is creepy just like the joker played by Jared leto he gets a cameo he uses his skills to mess her mind up in arkam but I like to see him more as pops up from time to time keeping up with his gal we have katana the samurai lady who is on kill orders for these bad guys she is bad ass.we have the rest of the motley crue story Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje ...and of them diablo character and boomerang are cool character with their fiery stories and their tech gear to kill Killer Croc Jay Hernandez playing a laid back character.. Diablo he gets his role down to tee because his character is fiery but learned to control but it takes a pivotal moment for him breath fire back into life just in the nick of time saving the crew we also get the flash cameo looking forward to seeing his film Ezra Miller ... The Flash Jai Courtney ... Boomerang Common ... Monster TAdam Beach ... Slipknot all these character get great songs on the soundtrack to the film during the action with the head played Viola Davis her character takes no crap Amanda Waller from any one asking her superiors to support her so we see the explorer Cara delevigne character June Moore/enchantress going cave hunting only to discover the wrong cave and accidentally gets taking over by a witch so fast forward to the story were she can shape shift and fly anywhere with getting caught so with but Amanda Waller has enchantress under control with a heart in the box so she has her on a tight leash so with the group together the army has Scott Eastwood .playing.. Lieutenant GQ Edwards and Joel Kinnaman ... Rick Flag who plays the head of this rag bag team of mist fits with him in the lead the suicide squads find out their mission as there is a giant terrorizing midway city so they leave from there jail in bel reve and seeing them on the chopper as Alain Chanoine ... Businessman / Incubus this incubus is in cahoots with enchantress so as the team comes under attack the action begins as all hell brakes loose the team don't want to be there but haven't got a choice so as enchantress has a team of weird baddies between them and the mysterious lighting object they have to battle themselves keep rick flag alive and deal with Harley Quinn absconding with her boy and her craziness and a sniper shot to kill but dead shot as he say he never misses but unfortunately her chopper goes down not knowing is this a ploy who knows fool them as well along with great special effects rick flag has his issues with enchantress to so this weird film is just punk enjoy Worst. Heroes. Ever Mid-credits scene: Bruce Wayne has dinner with Amanda Waller, offering her his protection in exchange for one of her top secret folders on meta humans enchantress has her chance also with an evil monster that she created in toe but fighting with the squad diablo uses all his fiery arsenal going to for toe visually this is just about matching the tall monster but his friends have an ace up there sleeveThe acting was more than I expected out of this movie. In terms of acting, I'll go in order of my top 3: Robbie, Leto, and Smith. All of their portrayals are excellent. El Diablo is a nice surprise, his character made us feel for him, maybe even more-so than the top stars. Leto knocks it out of the park. As a Ledger fanboy, I was dreading his performance, but his character was amazing down to the slightest movement. No amount of dialogue is wasted nor any simple movement is wasted. Overall, the movie was great, again, some awkward script, but the action scenes are done extremely well and the acting is great. 8/10.just below the great Batman v Superman in my opinion but its set it up nicely for a sequel and the rest of the justice league",Suicide Squad
177,Dan1863Sickles,Low Expectations Are The Key,6,17 March 2021,"I'm not a superhero fan. When I was a kid I read comic books, but not DC or Marvel. I read only the Warren Magazines, Eerie, Creepy, and Vampirella. They were for older readers. They were straight horror, in black and white. They often attempted social commentary, and they always had darker plot lines.All of which is to say I had no expectations for Suicide Squad. I caught it on TV on Sunday afternoon when I had nothing else to do. And I liked it a lot. Will Smith is getting older, but he gives Deadshot, the leader of the super villains, a lot more dignity and a lot more intelligence than a younger actor could have. Margot Robbie is so amazingly over the top as Harley Quinn. She's as funny as Carole Lombard in My Man Godfrey, and as terrifying as Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet. And when she waves that baseball bat around, she's as brave and crazy and glamorous and tragic as James Remar playing Ajax in The Warriors.The plot of this movie -- evil villains fighting for the good guys and getting sent on a suicide mission -- is clearly drawn from the Lee Marvin movie, the Dirty Dozen. But the mood and tone and feel of the film is more like Walter Hill's The Warriors. It's not just Hayley Quinn's baseball bat. It's the lonely, unwanted heroes walking down dark New York City streets. It's the sense that the whole world is against them. And there's the all-powerful black woman who cooly narrates the story like she's the Chorus in a Greek tragedy -- or an all-night DJ on an underground radio station.""Be looking good, Boppers -- all the way back to Arkham Asylyum.""",Suicide Squad
178,msbreviews,Rating: C+,5,6 August 2017,"Will Smith as Deadshot is great, it's his best performance in the last few years and his character has the most interesting and heartfelt backstory. There's even a scene with another character from the DCEU (DC Extended Universe) where he shows the first signs of humanity present in him and that is really cool to watch. He is also the main source of entertainment and fun in the film, he basically throws his Will Smith's charisma in there and it works really well. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn portrays perfectly this known character from the comics, she's exactly like I wanted her to be. She gets that crazy insanity just right, she's super funny and also has some moments of humanity throughout the movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is really great as well, I can't say too much about her (no spoilers in here), but I honestly can't wait to see her again in future installments. She's bad-ass!Batman (Ben Affleck) appears in the movie for a couple of scenes and he's awesome, Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is a pleasant surprise, he actually has a personality in this film and The Joker (Jared Leto) ... Is fine. I'm really not sure of how I feel about this interpretation of one of the most famous villains ever. Jared Leto tried to mix the vibe of the previous actors that portrayed this character (Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson) and I guess I'll have to wait until another movie is released because The Joker barely has a scene in this one ... With this in mind, I move on to my list of cons, which are more than I expected.The Joker isn't relevant, at all, in this movie. The trailer and all of the advertising for this movie is a complete fraud! They tried to make him the villain until the release because they weren't sure that Deadshot and Harley Quinn were enough to sell this movie. He has some good scenes and that's it ... Disappointing. Also, there are some other characters that are in the film without a purpose: Katana (Karen Fukuhara), Slipknot (Adam Beach) or even Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) ... They're just there because the film needed them to form the squad, I guess.The first act is good, but it's so choppy and has a lot of flashbacks. In fact, the whole movie has flashbacks thrown into it with no structure whatsoever, either 10 minutes into the movie or 10 minutes before the end of it. Not that they're bad, actually they're pretty interesting and the best part of the movie (some actually would give a good story for a solo movie), but so badly edited. The beginning is total exposition, we have this whole set of flashbacks and cuts to set up these characters. I understand they need to introduce them, but they do it in such a lazy way, literally like, ""Hey, this is Deadshot. He shoots people and has a daughter. Care about him."". It's definitely not the best way to do it. It's a shame that a film with so many great characters under- utilizes them so much.The other two acts are literally a mix of different scenes that turn into one big mess. I know for a fact that after Batman V Superman received some negative reviews about the darker tone present in the movie, the producers re-shot a lot of scenes just to add a little more of a lighter vibe to Suicide Squad. That just made things worse, they try to put together a darker and lighter tone at the same time and it doesn't work out. Even the soundtrack, which I thought would be amazing (and it was in some scenes), comes out completely wrong in some moments. It's a complete mishmash.Another problem with this movie is the main villain, who kind of remained omitted since in the trailers it was almost all The Joker. I don't consider it a spoiler, you probably know already who this character is, but still, I'm warning you ... Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) is a witch that can control people's minds and apparently dance ... Yes, that's all she does in 90% of the movie, dance. She stands in the middle of the city for the whole time just moving her arms around and pretending she has a hula hoop in her hips. She couldn't be less of a plot device for the squad to have a purpose and do something, I don't even blame the actress because she had to spend most of her time looking at a green screen and speaking some strange language. I actually liked the introduction to this character, the first time she turns into Enchantress is amazing, but after a subway scene, she becomes CGI awful.The ending is terrible, it remembered me of Fantastic Four's ending of last year ... It's that bad. Literally, there's a character who is definitely dead, it has ""tentacles"" going through its body and after 5 minutes ... It's fine, nothing happened, clothes are clean, everything's perfect. The plot given for the squad doesn't make a lot of sense when you have superheroes like Batman, Wonder Woman, or The Flash in this universe ... Why would a girl with a bat or a guy that shoots really well fight a super-powerful being that can destroy them in seconds if he wishes to? Just wait until you know how they kill them and stop the beacon ...I really expected more of this movie, it has really great characters, some amazing performances from the cast, some funny scenes, but the story is unstructured, the action isn't that good (the ""monsters"" that they have to defeat along the way are at the level of a Stormtrooper) and the plot doesn't really make sense.Not bad, but disappointing.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Suicide Squad
179,griffolyon12,"Not Bad, But Not Great Either",6,6 August 2016,"It was a bit of a surprise when DC and Warner Bros. announced a Suicide Squad movie a few years back. While the team made up of super villains forced into doing good by the US government has long been a fan favorite, it was an odd choice for the third movie in the shared DC universe of movies following Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I still personally feel that way after seeing Suicide Squad. While the movie is leagues better than most critics want you to believe it is, it's also not as good as most fans were wanting it to be either. Instead, Suicide Squad is a flawed, yet occasionally fun comic book movie that will appease some, but not all.The movie opens with a series of vignettes setting up the primary members of the Suicide Squad: Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flagg, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang, Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje's Killer Croc, and Jay Hernandez's Diablo. They are all brought together by a morally dubious US agent by the name of Amanda Waller (played exceptionally by Viola Davis), to go into the fictional metropolis of Midway City to stop a supernatural threat that threatens the entire world. Once the Suicide Squad sets down in Midway City, the movie really starts to take off with wall-to-wall action, but the first forty-five minutes of set up really keeps the movie ever from gaining much momentum upfront. On top of that, as a DC Comics fanboy, I found many of the portrayals of the characters lacking.While it is fun to see the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn, on the bigscreen for the first time, I don't think writer/director David Ayer handled her well. Personally, I feel Margot Robbie was well cast, but she lacked the right material to make Harley the Harley from the comic books. The way Harley is written in this movie is a little too flirtatious for my liking, missing that naive quality that makes her so irresistibly entertaining in the comics. Then there is the bigger issue of the portrayal of Harley's puddin', Mr. J himself, the Joker. Actor Jared Leto and Ayer seemed to want to turn the Joker more into a gangsta rather than a gangster, and I'm not really sure I like that angle, with the metal teeth just annoying me as a fanboy. Of course I could live with the appearance of the character if he acted like the comic book Joker for most of the movie, but the way the character is portrayed, he rarely does. He often comes across serious in most of his scenes, which is in stark contrast to every other Joker portrayal ever. Honestly, Jared Leto was always going to have a tough row to hoe with him being the first actor to follow Heath Ledger in the role, and unfortunately, while they tried to differentiate Leto's Joker from Heath's Joker, in the end, they might have tried too much. Now while I took issue with some of the characterizations in this movie, there were some that were spot on.Viola Davis is absolutely perfect as Amanda Waller, getting the authoritative swagger of the character down pat. Then there's Will Smith as Deadshot, who is essentially being Will Smith as a hit-man for hire, but his Deadshot works in areas where some of the other characters don't by injecting appropriate doses of humor and empathy into the role. And I can't go on without mentioning Karen Fukuhara as Katana, the sword- wielding ninja that comes in to protect Waller's liaison, Rick Flagg, from being turned on by the squad. Katana is not handled with as much attention as I wish she would have been, but Fukuhara makes the most of her limited screen time and really nails the silent, but deadly demeanor of the character. As well, while Ben Affleck is literally only in about two to three minutes of the whole movie, he continues to make a good impression as Batman. Sprinkle on top some action that is fun to watch unfold, and you have a Summer blockbuster that is more entertaining than it's not.All in all, Suicide Squad is a movie that is enjoyable enough to warrant seeing if you're a fanboy, but you'll still probably come away with a few quibbles of your own. I am still baffled as to why DC isn't choosing to be like Marvel and be more faithful to the comic books with most of their characters, but Suicide Squad does manage to get right more than it gets wrong. As far as the three movies currently in the DC Extended Universe, I'd have to say Suicide Squad is the weakest of the three, weaker than both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, which I still personally feel is the best of the flawed bunch.I give Suicide Squad a 6 out of 10!",Suicide Squad

182,MrDHWong,"Despite some plot holes and a somewhat generic villain, Suicide Squad is overall a pretty enjoyable film.",5,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is the third film in the DC Cinematic Universe. Even though I still had doubts as to whether it would be any good, considering the lukewarm feelings I have for Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, this film is a big improvement. So far, I consider it the best of the three films in DC's Extended Universe.Months after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, government official Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a team of apprehended supervillains to undertake dangerous missions in exchange for lighter prison sentences and clemency. These supervillains include expert marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Elise Robbie), fire manipulator El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Australian assassin Boomerang (Jai Courtney), and the reptilian Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje).While the film suffers from a poorly edited and choppy first act, as was also the case with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad has such a fun, manic vibe to it that it is hard for me to dislike. I feel that the best scenes involved Deadshot's backstory and Harley Quinn's fall from grace as a respected criminal psychiatrist. However, it is Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker that was the biggest surprise for me. His chilling take on the role fits the film's aesthetic perfectly. The soundtrack was great too, which included music from Queen and The White Stripes. Despite some plot holes and a somewhat generic villain, Suicide Squad is overall a pretty enjoyable film.I rate it 7/10.",Suicide Squad

185,Laakbaar,Entertaining enough,7,18 January 2017,"Reading the other reviews, it seems many of those panning this movie are comic book fans who know the comic-book version of these characters and the various movies they have generated. They are deeply involved in the ""Marvel universe"" and the ""DC universe"". Many of them seem to be deeply offended if a movie character differs from their expectations.Well, I'm not in that demographic and I'm not that deeply involved. I came to this movie as someone without that kind of baggage. It even appealed to me that no Marvel character was involved because I'm sick of those movies. I liked the fact that I didn't know any of these characters (well, except for the Joker).To me, this seemed like a typical comic-book movie. Lots of strange superhero-like characters, futuristic technology, action, fighting, explosions and so on.I thought it was a half entertaining film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone of course, but I can't say I hated it (which is how I feel about any movie with Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Batman, etc.). This movie is not even close to being as good as Galaxy.",Suicide Squad
186,CANpatbuck3664,"Suicide Squad Delivers Interesting Characters and Great Performances, it Could Have Been Great but Ends up Being Just Pretty Good",8,5 August 2016,"I was beyond excited for this movie. From David Ayer directing (I loved End of Watch and Fury) to the cast (Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Jared Leto) and then those trailers were just fantastic. Everything I saw ahead of time said that this movie was going to be awesome and it would be the one to put the DC universe on track (I thought Batman V Superman was okay). Then the bad reviews came out and my hopes and expectations were completely dashed. So I went in with low expectations, ready to be ridiculed for having so much faith in the Skwad but I left the theatre happy. This is a flawed movie to be sure but there's some great stuff in it, I admit it's not the home-run that DC and WB needed though.One of the bigger things that critics have complained about is how simple and scattershot the plot is. Honestly, they're not wrong. There isn't a whole lot to this story as a whole, it's more about characters (not an excuse but the characters are more than good enough to carry it). The arc of the plot didn't bother me, a good portion of the movie is setting up the squad so it's not like defeating the villain was the sole goal of Suicide Squad. The editing can be pretty messy, the beginning of the movie has some of the best stuff but it doesn't flow well. I don't want to go into the behind the scenes news but it makes sense considering the news behind the editing process. I actually thought the movie moved at a good pace and it wasn't as jarring as the critics have said.When it comes to the characters, there's so many in this movie. The upside is that a lot of them are interesting but the downside is that there isn't enough screen time for everyone. The 2 main characters are Harley and Deadshot and I was impressed how the movie developed them. You get behind Harley's difficulties being controlled by the Joker, she kills people and does his bidding but she's been completely broken because of her psychological issues. Deadshot's weakness for his daughter would be corny in any other movie but the movie sells you on the fact that although he's a hit-man, he just wants an amount of normalcy with his daughter and he loves her. Another character who gets some good moments is Diablo, his story is pretty tragic and his story towards redemption throughout the movie was almost touching. To address the elephant in the room, I think the Joker was necessary because you couldn't have done Harley's origin without him (which was very well done) but he has little impact on the actual plot. I understand why they brought him in longer. How do you have one of the biggest comic villains ever in just a cameo? It wouldn't do justice to the character so I get the reasoning behind it.The biggest reason to go see this movie is that for a comic book movie there really are some awesome performances. Will Smith completely returned to form as Deadshot. Deadshot's persona wasn't too far from some other Will Smith roles but Smith looked like he was having a great time and he nailed a complex character. Will benefited from not being the moral centre of the movie and I think that playing a more morally gray character was a good thing to do and he was great. Margot Robbie was awesome as Harley Quinn. I was so impressed that she was willing to get down into the dirtier aspects of her character, she throws a lot of physicality into it even. She completely owns her scenes and if anything I'll be disappointed if this movie isn't a success because it should be her ticket to bigger things. I expected Deadshot and Harley to be good, the biggest surprise might have been Jay Hernandez as Diablo. There was a lot of angst to his performance and he stood out in a crowded group.Some of the other actors were great but I wanted to see even more of them. This is easily the best job I've seen from Jai Courtney, he hit it out of the park but he's mainly a background character. Viola Davis was also solid as Amanda Waller. Joel Kinnaman was fine as Rick Flagg. Cara Delevingne has taken a lot of crap for her dual portrayal of June Moon/Enchantress. She's not bad, she's not the strongest villain but she did a serviceable job. Last but certainly not least is Jared Leto as the Joker. I didn't have a problem with them doing a new version of the Joker but I didn't like Leto as much as I thought I would. He's creepy and unsettling but I didn't find him as threatening or scary as other versions. I understand a lot of his scenes were cut out though so maybe we just didn't get to see that side of his character.Every time I was just about to fall in love with this movie, something would snap me out of it. There would be an awkward cut, a bad piece of dialogue or the CGI wouldn't be as believable as it should (to be fair the action and the CGI are both pretty good throughout). I wanted this movie to be that game changer for DC but it fell short of that. It's not nearly as bad as critics are saying, it's a mixed bag but there are really good portrayals, good action and while it's not completely different, there's enough new stuff here to make it standout from the comic book crowd. I would be closer to a 7.5/10 but to counter the widespread hate around Suicide Squad I'll round up and give it an 8/10.",Suicide Squad
187,SquigglyCrunch,Can't Exceed the Ranks of Hopelessly Average,2,8 December 2016,"Suicide Squad follows a group of villains who are recruited to stop a threat in their city. The idea itself was done reasonably well, despite how dumb it actually is. It does a decent job explaining it and making it work, more or less. The soundtrack is, of course, pretty decent. It's probably the best part of the movie. The music fits the movie reasonably well too, despite the fact that it could have gotten away with using pretty much any kind of music anyway. Despite the minor goods, this movie is bad. The acting is terrible. Will Smith does a great job playing Will Smith, as per usual. He's not a character anymore, he's himself and he's really nothing special. Jay Hernandez was cringe- inducing to watch. He tried to pull off this weird black gangster performance that already doesn't work when a black man plays it. It doesn't work with a white guy, not to be racist. Jai Courtney is fine, but that's it. He pulls off an average performance, which in comparison to everyone else is pretty outstanding. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was generic as Killer Croc, he acts exactly how you'd expect: exaggeratedly. Cara Delevingne is awful as The Enchantress. As June Moone she's fine, but the second she goes all magical she's awful. Her mouth doesn't even sink up to her voice, and she gets all fidgety and it just doesn't work. She's trying to be creepy but she looks more like a parody magician. The two actors who stood out the most, however, were Jared Leto and Margot Robbie. Leto is, for his 12 minutes of screen-time, is tolerable for about half that time, after which he becomes so unbelievably annoying. If he's intolerable for 5 minutes, he's not going to make it in the Batman reboot. And Margot Robbie was so bad in this movie. She wasn't as annoying as Leto, but she still proved to be a nuisance. Her lines are performed with so much exaggeration, and her constant mood swings combined with the overall feel of the movie she just ends up being completely out of place. Maybe it wasn't entirely the actor's faults, considering they were dealing with this script. The jokes and one-liners are horribly written, many of which are performed by Margot Robbie. There's just no way to deliver these lines in a natural way. Not only is the dialogue horribly written, but the story manages to be just the same. It's so messy and incohesive, nothing flows properly. It'll show one scene, then pretend it doesn't exist. How does that work? I haven't the slightest idea. Everything is just thrown together, making the movie a massive, weird, LSD trip of a movie where nothing flows into an understandable, or even remotely interesting, story. But with all the pretty colors, it must be pretty to look at, right? Right? Wrong. The special effects are pretty terrible. It all looks incredibly fake, and when the movie tries to make some kind of distinct style with the effects and colors it just comes off cartoon-ish and fake. The main antagonists both look awful. One of them looks like some actor's face was copy-pasted onto this poorly CGI-ed magical body. As for the other, she's just a giant CGI mess. Special effects are constantly expelling from her body, and her whole body just looks fake, despite being a human and possibly an actual actor amidst all the falsehood. There were a handful of scenes that appeared to exist more for the sake of the trailer than the actual movie. The scene where the Joker is lying on the floor surrounded by knives and laughing maniacally was so forced. It just kind of happened. No explanation. Nothing. He talked to someone about something unrelated for a bit acted completely calm about it, then leaned back and laughed for 2 seconds. Where did that come from? In this same scene the word 'HA!' is written all over the walls, which is probably supposed to make him look insane. But really it just doesn't make any sense. You wonder under what circumstances would he stand by the walls and spray paint the same 2-letter word onto the wall multiple times. I find it hard to believe he'd write it in a fit of passion, considering how simple and meaningless the word is. It's just there in the hopes that the audience won't read into it and take it as further proof that the Joker is insane. But you'd have to be trying to make yourself look insane to actually take the time to write that. One of my biggest questions is what the point of a suicide squad even is. To my knowledge the movie takes place in Gotham, and both Batman and The Flash make appearances, and Superman gets mentioned, yet none of these guys are even considered for help. The characters never talk about how they could just use superheroes. Apparently using villains is the better option. And even without the authorities organizing anything, where the heck was Batman when the world was ending? Taking a nap? What about The Flash? Or Superman? Or literally any other superhero? Did they not see the violent beam of light in the sky, or the magic monsters? Just because the movie acknowledges their existence, doesn't mean they no longer have to show up in the movie. Overall Suicide Squad is absolute trash. There's so much wrong with it, much more than I've talked about because I pushed so much of it out of my mind in the hopes of forgetting it. At it's very best, this movie is hopelessly average. At worst, well, let's not talk anymore about that. In the end I would never recommend this movie.",Suicide Squad
188,ronakkotian,A very poor attempt in making a Suicide Squad film,2,9 August 2021,"WARNING: *MILD SPOILERS*To prepare for The Suicide Squad, I decided to rewatch the 2016 Suicide Squad and it was even more painful than last time.Suicide Squad is about a group of imprisoned supervillains that are recruited by a secret government agency in order to save the world from a dangerous threat.The DCEU have been really struggling and when Suicide Squad was slated to come out, a part of me was excited to see something different from the studio. However, before the 2017 Justice League film came out, I considered this to be the worst DCEU so far. The story has potential but the way it was told was so amateur. The script is one of the worst. It's filled with expository dialogue, that fails to flesh out characters properly, and jokes that do not work at the slightest. For a film with such a colourful poster, why does it look so ugly? Most of the film takes place at night and doesn't even look lit properly, the action is also incredibly dull with the final fight being so poorly shot and lit that I didn't know what was happening and the build-up to these events were so boring that I nearly fell asleep. The editing is some of the worst I've seen with scenes coming and going with no real structure and sometimes it would cut to these vibrant colours that felt so jarring due to the ugliness of the rest of the film. The soundtrack is filled with well known pop songs but they don't fit the scenes they're playing over. It's trying to be edgy but none of it feels coherent.The film introduces all the characters and gives plenty of time to explain the backstory behind Deadshot and Harley Quinn whereas the rest (Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc and El Diablo) get barely a minute. None of these characters are given proper character development and there's only one scene where the film tries to have these characters bond but it completely fails as it made me feel nothing. We also get introduced to another character named Katana halfway through the film. Not only is her introduction purely expository but her character is given nothing to do. Then we have The Joker, which may be the worst part of the film. Jared Leto isn't completely at fault since the script is terrible but his portrayal is still laughably bad. Margot Robbie is perfect for Harley Quinn and I love her in the role but she's given some of the most cringey lines. The villain isn't given anything to work and so her character is very bland. Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman try their best and Will Smith essentially plays himself.Suicide Squad is one of the worst comic book films I've seen. It's trying to be so many things but it just comes across messy and dull. With poorly developed characters, an awful script and boring story, I wouldn't recommend anyone see Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad
189,statuskuo,I Don't Get The Hate,8,8 August 2016,"Story? There is no story. And that's what's refreshing about this movie. It's pure entertainment, in the sense of ""Voltron,"" ""A-Team"" or ""G.I. Joe"" which is putting together a unit of absolute bad-a$$es to do something. Does it matter what it is? No.I'm so sick and tired of political messages jammed into Marvel movies (I think comic book movies on DC & Marvel are dumb to begin with). They happen to be the most offensive of the two. I suppose THIS constitutes what the world enjoys now...supposedly. Or the PC police critics.I can't begin to tell you how nice it is NOT to have social agendas in a movie and just...have fun. The hate may stem from the people who love these characters in the book. I can't justify any of it, since I don't read the funny pages, but it seemed to anger a lot of fans of the characters. Personally, Leto's Joker is...too comical for the grit of this movie. He's not as bad as you want him to be or as fun as Nicholson made him out to be. The Ledger Joker was...let's be real, the guy was fishing for recognition. But...it is what it is...entertainment.",Suicide Squad
190,Rickting,The DC Cinematic Universe has just committed cinematic suicide,4,11 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was such an exciting idea. A round-up of villains having to be heroes in exchange for shorter prison sentences in the hands of a talented director and strong cast? It was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, and it looked set to be the film which would save the DCEU following Batman Vs Superman. It only sent it further into darkness. SS is a total mess in every single way. The editing is incomprehensible, the action scenes are complete chaos and despite having such a colorful cast of characters the film is visually an endless pit of dark, gloomy CGI shapes getting beaten up by the characters. They're supposed to be villains, but if they are, then this cinematic universe has some of the loveliest bad guys ever. The plot is messy, confusing, lacking in depth and soul and every single underdeveloped element, especially Jared Leto's tragically wasted Joker, comes clashing and screaming together like an unruly crowd of brawling rioters with the subtlety of a machine gun helicopter blowing up a city block. Lacking in depth, soul and nuances of any kind, only an awesome soundtrack, some good performances and occasional moments where the excellence of the trailers comes to life are there to offer much satisfaction. None of that saves the film. It's pretty scary that I can't decide if it's worse than Batman Vs Superman. 4/10",Suicide Squad

I enjoyed the performance as actors of Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jared Leto and the others. Margot Robbie is pretty convicing as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot. The movie is pretty solid technically.: the visual effects are pretty well made and the moments where they are presented at the beginning was pretty artistic and entertaining. Also the fight scenes even if they are not so much. I think all characters bring interest in the movie because they are vilain and we follow each other and understand why they act like this. The past scenes make us more empathic about some characters and we can, in one way, undefstand them. The movie is pretty good, even if i will love to have a plot more complex than this but thats ok i guess. I will love to have more revelation, surprise or even a twist but they were none.

Marggot Robbie as Harley Quinn is just awesome. Even Jai Courtney is very good at Boomerang. Actually my only complain with this character is that there is not enough of him !!! lol The story is basic sure, but it work. Lots of great action. Look although i did like Deadpool, i tough this movie was even better, yeah no jokes.My only big problem with the movie is i am not a fan of Pimp Joker. I mean the actor did a great job with what he had to work with, but the look is completely off. Joker should NOT be tattooed, no matter if once in the comic he was or whatever. The street gang metal teeth look ridiculous too. But Jared Leto has the face for it tough, make up wise and hair colour, that was good.

199,PyroSikTh,"Shaky Opening, but Fantastic Character Work",6,5 August 2016,"The movie starts very shaky. Editing and pacing feels completely off and the character introductions take a bit too long thanks to flashbacks being interweaved with the introductory scene of Waller proposing the squad's formation to her peers. This long sequence of introductions also immediately paints who's important and who isn't. For instance Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Enchantress each get multiple long flashbacks, while Killer Croc, Boomerang, and Diablo just get a little nod to their history, and Slipknot is left out entirely (spoiler, he's the red shirt). Even after the introductions, the set-up still isn't complete, as they then need to assemble the team and create an antagonist for them to go after. After that's over though, and the action starts to kick in, it's nigh relentless. I mean, there really isn't much plot here at all; Waller proposes the formation of the squad, a villain starts to destroy the city, and the squad is hastily put together and sent in.Okay, so plot isn't the film's strong suit, but it's linear simplicity is what makes it as enjoyable as it is. Just sit back and enjoy the craziness that fills the screen. What Suicide Squad lacks in plot, it more than makes up for with character development, particularly for Harley and Deadshot, but Diablo also gets quite a pivotal moment as well. Their flashbacks don't end after the introductions, as we get a few more for each them that delves into their backstory a bit more to show how they got to where they are now. Of course Harley Quinn gets a lot of attention, but Diablo's development is particularly heartbreaking.But back to Harley Quinn. She's a massively popular character and of course Suicide Squad spends a lot of time looking at her. This is her first ever Live-Action incarnation, so I got a massive kick out of seeing her transition from Harleen Quinzel to the villainess we know and love a la Mad Love. Also seeing her and Joker together was exquisite, and I didn't want those scenes to end. Give me a whole movie of Joker and Harley and I'll chuck money at the screen indiscriminately. I particularly loved the recreation of their most iconic comic cover, with Harley in her full Animated Universe costume. Margot Robbie was also probably my favourite casting choice for her (living at least; Brittany Murphy would've been 10/10 perfect, but alas), and she did not disappoint. She managed to delve deep into the character and embrace both her playful, flirtatious side, and her more vulnerable and human side as well. Harley is a character beyond the red-and-black scheme and the high-pitched voice, and Margot Robbie proves that once and for all. Give me more Margot Robbie Harley Quinn WB! More!Then there's Jared Leto's Joker. He features a lot in the promotional material, but don't think that means he plays a pivotal role. I was personally expecting little more than a cameo, but he certainly gets more screen time than that. He's just like a minor annoyance in the background who chiefly appears in the flashbacks. By the third act he's almost completely forgotten about, and early on his presence is literally just as a companion to Harley (somewhat amusingly). As for Leto himself, I can't say I hated his portrayal. He's definitely the sociopathic Joker from more recent iterations; violent, unpredictable, and creepy. However, let's settle this now, he still wasn't as good as Heath Ledger's interpretation.There is quite a bit of humour in Suicide Squad as well. I mean it could've gone further and become DC's version of Deadpool, or Guardians of the Galaxy, or even Kick-Ass, and in some ways it absolutely was, but they could've embraced it wholly and gone all-out black comedy with it and I guarantee it would've worked. They didn't, but it's still a very funny movie. Jai Courtney in particular was great with his comedy delivery as Captain Boomerang. I mean I'm not exactly the biggest Jai Courtney fan in the world, but he did do a fantastic job of Boomerang, and I'll admit competed with Robbie's Harley Quinn as one of the most entertaining characters of the movie.The laughs are balanced out really well with an ear to the more tragic and emotional side of this ragtag group of supervillains as well. It's not all super serious and dark, but when it is, it's actually quite heartbreaking. El Diablo in particular has a really heartbreaking history that rattles the whole squad in their down time. Harley, as I mentioned, also shows her more vulnerable side on a couple of occasions as well, while Will Smith's Deadshot is rooted to humanity thanks to his daughter. Floyd's always been one of the more human members of the team in the comics (or those he features in, at least), and the movie makes no difference there at all.I could talk a little more about it's place in the extended universe, or the use of it's soundtrack (hit and miss), or delve a bit more into the acting work, but I don't feel there's anything interesting enough to say about any of it. Suicide Squad is not the complete trainwreck professional critics would have you believe (surprise, surprise). It's opening moments are badly paced, mismatched, and overly-long, but it starts to find itself from the second act onwards. Plot is so-so at best and the action is entertaining but unmemorable, but the character work is sublime. Every character gets their moment to shine, some more than others I'll admit, but everyone gets their turn. I give Suicide Squad a very entertaining 7/10.",Suicide Squad
200,CinematicInceptions,Have low expectations.,5,7 August 2016,"It was disappointing how much this turned into a superhero movie. Yes, it's in a superhero setting, but the plot felt way, way too much like a standard superhero movie. Now that doesn't make it bad, but it was advertised as something that was more like a satire of a superhero movie. As soon as I saw the lightning bolt going into the sky, I thought ""Oh, not another one of those movies."" The same shot and plot basis has already been in three major action movies of the last five years: Man of Steel, Dark of the Moon, and Avengers. It doesn't automatically make a movie bad, but there are more ways to make a plot be on a global scale than to have it almost get destroyed. Then to top that off we had the witch conveniently die without killing her host body and were given no explanation for this. Again, this isn't necessarily bad, it just comes up so frequently and wasn't what I was paying to see.There were no disappointments to speak of with the characters, though. They aren't balanced great, but they all feel natural and get good performances. We only really care about Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Flagg. Deadshot and Flagg both have someone they care about, which is always a good way of gaining access. We can sympathize with Harley a little because of how normal she used to be and how she hides behind her mask of false insanity. The other characters are just kind of there for fun, and to advance the plot, but they definitely make it better. My favorite was El Diablo, the quiet master.There was a lot more action than I was anticipating. There wasn't any hint as to what the mission the squad was going to take in the trailers, so I was a little surprised when there was a whole military team fighting a bunch of zombies. Villains are at their best when they are confronting another character in a fight, which never really happened. Deadshot was easily the most formidable in a fight, followed by Katana. There is some debate about whether Harley was over sexualized, and I would answer with ""yes, but not outrageously.""As advertised there was a decent amount of comedy. Will Smith was in his usual element delivering sarcastic lines with just the right amount of seriousness. The smaller parts like Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang had a few funny moments. Harley Quinn was supposed to be funny, but she ended up just being annoying, like that classmate you had to do group work with in school who makes lame jokes in a failed attempt to make things less awkward.The script wasn't bad from a crafting standpoint. The exposition at the beginning was pretty good, giving us a sense of each character. The dialogue was decent too, and all of the actors gave good performances. Jared Leto's rendition of the Joker should not disappoint even when compared to Heath Ledger. He wasn't scripted as well as the Joker of the Dark Knight, but the acting was not lacking. The visuals were adequately amazing as expected, but a lot of the supernatural action felt like it was supposed to be part of a video game.If you like superhero movies, this is pretty cookie cutter. If you are hoping that this will be the DC movie that is ""different"" from all those other super movies, you are in the wrong place. The trailers are accurate to content, but not that accurate to theme. I'm not really surprised that they concealed the big-scale plot in the trailers, because I don't think that's what people really wanted from this kind of movie. Overall Rating: 7.3/10.",Suicide Squad
201,MattBrady099,Suicide Squad - Movie Review,4,7 August 2016,"Hey DC, are you trying to f**k this up on purpose? Seriously! What the hell is going on over there. ""Suicide Squad"" was your chance to redeem yourself from the last critical failures. This movie should have been the one that saved DC and get it back on it's feet, but I guess not. I wanted this to be good or at least surprise me. There are some pros and plenty of cons in this. So lets kick it off. Will Smith and Viola Davis are easily the best parts of this movie. Smith brings the humility to his character and Davis brings the fear. Will Smith is the only character in this group that has any characterization as we get to know more about his past. Will Smith is basically playing Will Smith, but he was still good as the character. To be honest, I thought Voila Davis was more of a real threat then the actual threat itself. Margot Robbie was pretty good as Harley Quinn, but wasn't the show stealer as I thought she would be. She did a great job capturing the character and there was little peaks of humility as well. Her accent dose keep changing in a few scenes, but I can easily look pass that. I was one of those people who was against Jared Leto new look as the Joker. I know he's trying a different take on the character, but with all the stupid tattoo's all over him with the word 'damaged' on his forehead and the gangster grill teeth just wasn't the Joker. But I give Leto this, it's a bold move to take on the character after Ledger's unforgettable performance. I was being a bit too harsh at the time and Leto is a very method actor, so what's there's nothing to complain with the casting (besides the new look). After seeing the movie, Leto doesn't do a bad job as the Joker. He doesn't have that much screen time and every time he's on it screen, he kinda chews up the scenery. He was enjoyable to watch and I will make a full judgment when we have a movie where he has more screen time. Coming to think of it, The Joker should have been the main villain of the movie and not Enchantress (I'll get to her in a minute). Oh and I can't be the only one who thinks he looks like some manic you'll see in a Purge movie. Cara Delevingne not only gives the worst performance in the movie, but also the most laughable one as well. I mean, what is up with that hip moves and twirling her arms around? It's like the director gave up. Enchantress is right up there with Dr. Doom from ""Fant4stic"" as the worst villain in comic book movie. Enchantress is the basic villain who wants to shoot a giant blue lazier in the sky to destroy the world. Oh and please stop it with the blue lazier thing, it's in every comic book movie now and it's so stupid. Here's my question: Why would you sent these crazy and dangerous people on a mission to stop Enchantress. Yeah I really hope that doesn't back fire at all. I mean sure, send a guy who calls himself Captain Boomerang who's an insane person that throws boomerangs that never comes back to him to save us from giant portals from other worlds. Is it because they are expendable? It would have made a lot more sense if Wonder Women or The Flash or just anyone with god like powers to go on this mission. This really is a suicide mission. The rest of the Squad members were pretty forgettable and just didn't do anything. Katana was just kinda there. Slipknot is in it for a few minutes. Killer Croc just stands around going ""mmmm"" or ""yeah"", they didn't do anything with that character. The third act was this gigantic action scene that takes place in the city and the scene itself was just a mess. It was so muddled together and the editing was so poor that it sadly did remind me of ""Fant4stic"" climax. Some of the music choices didn't really fit well during a couple of scenes. It felt out of place and was only thrown at the last minute to make it a little light at heart. This is because of the heavy criticism for ""Batman V Superman"" for being too dark. I think DC biggest problem is that they are literally rushing the movies out just to catch up with Marvel. Take your time DC. But of course, many will be angry that I said that and will go to terrifying lengths to defend it. Fan boys seem to choose to deny any flaws from these movies and praise it for it's non-existing efforts. I'm not a DC hater. I'm not a Marvel fan boy. I only want a freaking good movie, is that hard to ask for. Just because it tried something new doesn't always mean it will bring great results. Everyone has an opinion, that's a no-brainier. Agree or disagree, just please don't act like a cry baby when some has a different opinion to you. Overall rating: ""Suicide Squad"" was a huge disappointment in a lackluster year for summer movies. The more I think about this, the more I hate it.",Suicide Squad
202,dfle3,This reminds me why I usually avoid most superhero films...42.5%,4,25 August 2016,"Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this film is the title...which was maybe just enough of a lure to get me into the cinema to watch it. After the closing credits had finished, I remembered why I tend to like the anti-superhero films the best...they're just more entertaining. Amongst those films that I really enjoyed are ""Watchmen"", ""Kick-Ass"" and ""Hancock"", with the latter starring Will Smith, who also has a featured role in ""Suicide squad"".The plot concerns a secret U.S. government agency setting about to assemble a black ops type team of supervillains, in the wake of the events in some previous superhero film...which I couldn't be bothered watching...one with Superman...or something...the reasoning being that the world needs powerful fighters to combat threats like another Superman...but one committed to evil, not niceness. All the supervillains that the agency has in mind to recruit are in a high security gaol. Obviously a method to gain the supervillains' co-operation needs to be found...it's not like public service is very important to them. The agency's potential employee screening tests will be critically important...A subplot involves a ""romance"" between two supervillians...Harley Quinn (played by Australian actress Margot Robbie) and The Joker (played by Jared Leto). Their romance is made more problematic by The Joker not actually being in gaol.Whilst the film does at least provide some sort of backstory or origin story for each supervillain, I just didn't find any of it (i.e. the characters or the film) engaging. My guess is that the people who will get the most out of this film will be those who have immersed themselves in this universe, via comics or other media. As someone who had not done so, I just didn't get a thrill out of seeing all these characters, most of whom I was not familiar with.Some characters I was familiar with, like The Joker. Jared Leto's portrayal provides hints of Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse now"", Jaws, from the Bond universe and a sort of a punk gangster...part Johnny Rotten, part the white singer from The Prodigy. Does The Joker command the screen? No. Of the ""conventional"" superhero movies I've seen, The Dark Knight stands out for one thing...the performance of Australian actor Heath Ledger as The Joker. By the end of that Batman trilogy I realised one thing...Batman himself is boring. Whilst being a good movie, The Dark Knight could have been great...if it was 152 minutes of Heath Ledger playing The Joker in it.Anyway, since the early part of the movie concerns the recruitment of these supervillains, I was left wondering who on Earth they would be fighting...they do get to go up against a powerful character though, which is just as well (for the viewer).Throughout the entire movie, I laughed only once due to a character saying something funny. Can't remember who said the thing which made me laugh...The Joker? Harley Quinn? These are meant to be ""wacky"" and ""zany"" characters, right? Harley seems more like a rebellious teenager than a psychopath (but she is cute). The Joker is mirthless. Supervillains? They seem more like misunderstood and redeemable characters. And Captain Kangaroo (played by Australian Jai Courtney) is a supervillain? He seems more like a grown up The Feral Kid or a glorified goon. Not having explored these characters elsewhere, it just surprised me that the agency in this film would want to recruit somebody like Captain Kangaroo.What's the worst thing about this film? The soundtrack. It's not that I didn't like some of the songs used (early on you hear a lot of baby boomer era pop and rock songs), it's more that these songs function as a substitute for the film's inability to create characters or moments which capture your imagination. In other words, the music is supposed to create that thrill of excitement which the film is incapable of delivering. It's just lazy a lazy, ineffectual shortcut to affect. If you were born after the 1960s and 1970s and are unfamiliar with these songs, then it's hard to imagine these songs being able to manipulate your emotions and thus make up for what the film is failing to deliver. There are some songs from later though. You only hear a few seconds of these songs...not doubt used so as to be included on the soundtrack. Can't say that I heard enough songs that I particularly liked to want to own such an album though.Would I want to see this film again? No. It has zero repeat viewing value. Neither the characters nor the film captures the imagination. By the by: Rick Flag (played by Joel Kinnaman)? Weird name. Made me think of ""Ric Flair""! Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is...surprising. Hmm. She's with the government? M'kay.Will I watch a sequel? I very much doubt it.",Suicide Squad
203,funtasticfour,Some fun characters surrounded by bad CG,8,8 September 2018,"This story was a bit of a mess, but the fun characters can't be denied. Harley Quinn was perfect. Deadshot was pretty good, and most of the rest, except for the Joker. As is usual with DC comic movies, they struggle with villains, and overuse computer effects. So the first 3/4 of the movie was pretty good, leading up to a disappointing end that is chaotic and cartoony. Still, I enjoyed this more the second time, but truly it is only for hardcore comic book nerds like myself, but perhaps less picky ones.",Suicide Squad
204,MovieHoliks,A Little Understanding Goes A Long Way...,7,29 August 2016,"...That's the theme I sorta took from this one. So I made it to the local multi-plex to check out this latest in the ""DC Universe""; this one from writer/director, David Ayer (""Fury"", ""Training Day"", ""Street Kings"", etc..), known mostly for a series of crime pictures. I wasn't terribly familiar with too many of the characters in this, but apparently portraying ""Deadshot"" was one of the reasons Mr. Smith was not able to do double duty with the sequel to ""Independence Day"", which just came out so many weeks ago. And he is probably the best thing about this movie. Jared Leto is good as the Joker, but after Heath Ledger's performance eight years ago, he's got some big shoes to fill. I also really liked his girlfriend, Harley Quinn, of course played by Margot Robbie, the big breakout star from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" a few years back. She stole just about every scene she was in. The new ""Robocop"" star, Joel Kinnaman, was also pretty good as the military leader of the bunch. Never been a big fan of Jay Hernandez, but thought he was really good as ""El Diablo"". And *SPOILER* Adam Beach as ""Slipknot"" was out of there way too soon IMHO. Possible More *SPOILERS* -- I enjoyed the cameos from some expected, and some unexpected, other DC Universe characters from other movies and TV shows.Overall, I had a really good time at this movie. I don't think it was as well-received as the studio hoped it would be (maybe thinking it would be the next ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", in terms of it's box office performance), but I would definitely recommend giving this one a watch.",Suicide Squad
205,abcvision,Trust no evil,6,9 August 2016,"Sometimes to combat evil you must use some evil. The premise of Suicide Squad is that a top secret cohort of despicable criminals are put together to fight a world threat. The first part of the movie is intense back story. So much that I felt I needed to take notes. Then you have these bad dudes assembled and they conflict with their handlers. To me the movie had the potential to be awesome but was a blend of bits rolled into one. Very intense fighting scenes that were obviously created with 3D in mind. Theses misfits come together to create their own family and seek to discover what is really important- family, friends and an honorable word. Harley Quinn does not disappoint as the sultry villainess. These heroes are on a self destructive odyssey. All for one and one for all. This movie takes you oo the road less traveled. One might ask, can evil be trusted?",Suicide Squad
206,JakeBrinkman,"Not a great superhero movie, but also not a bad one",7,2 January 2019,"Note: This review is for the extended version, not the theatrical version.This movie probably would have been more enjoyable as a high-budget TV series. The biggest issue with this film is that it feels rushed, even in the extended version. The team members go from ""every man for himself"" to ""I'm willing to give up everything for my teammates"" far too quickly to be believable. I feel like they were quite successful in giving most of the characters ample time for background development, but they simply did not have enough time to convincingly unify the members into a team that is willing to work together.On overall aspects, I felt the intro words for each character were too fast with too many words on screen. Some jokes were good, while others fell flat. I didn't have an issue with the music as other reviewers seem to have.I'd like to go through the main characters next:Deadshot - Easily the best thing about this movie, and I can see why they are considering a solo film for him. In a team of crazies, it's good to have a relatable character to ground the film.Killer Croc - Although I wish they had used CGI to make him closer to his true size, the character was done very well for what he is.Harley Quinn - Also done well, although I never saw anything quite crazy enough or relatable enough to make her a primary character. And a couple of the jokes they gave her were quite bad.The Joker - This is every comic fan's biggest complaint, so I'll start with something positive. Jared Leto actually performed the part well with what little he was given. His scenes and dialogue had little going on, but he managed to draw it out to keep it interesting. It's obvious that this film wanted a different direction for The Joker than previously shown on screen, and it appears this movie aimed for ""disturbing"" to be the primary description. In that, they were very successful. I almost wanted to look away every time he was on screen. Even his distinctive laugh was changed for this film, and the result was quite unsettling. I believe many viewers might have misinterpreted their dislike for the character as Leto's poor acting, but that is simply not the case; the audience was not intended to like him. While Leto can be forgiven, other fundamental changes to the iconic villain are unacceptable. The Joker is presented as a typical gangster. Aside from dressing strangely and forcing his minions to do the same, there is never anything really bizarre or terrifying enough to make him a convincing Joker. But the worst part was his interactions with Harley. Harley's love for The Joker is supposed to not be reciprocated. This is actually shown well in several scenes, but then counteracted by The Joker wanting to help her escape. They should have given The Joker some selfish motive for saving her rather than his implied love for her.Diablo, Rick Flagg, and Katana - As minor characters, they are still given fairly relatable backgrounds, although Katana less so than the other two.Captain Boomerang - He was given very little background and zero emotional scenes. I honestly felt that he didn't belong in the movie aside from one or two scenes that made me laugh. When he was given a chance at freedom, I see no reason at all why he decides to stick with the team.The Witch and the villain - These characters are very unrelatable, but I can forgive that since they are attempting to make so many other characters relatable to the audience.",Suicide Squad
207,markovd111,Watched director's cut and was amazed!,8,16 March 2020,"OK, hear me out. I love both MARVEL and DC., but MARVEL has cooler and more creative super heroes while DC doesn't. But MARVEL has boring and unimaginative bad guys and DC has better ones. In that spirit, I enjoyed almost every second of this movie. Performances were amazing and I am very thankful to Margot Robbie for making Harley Quinn popular. I am not, however, thankful to Jared Leto who made Joker a gangster who was kicked in the head during childhood. Despite that, movie is filled with good atmosphere and music which fits with the scenes very well, making it an enjoyable ride. One thing that people also don't seem to understand. This is not an action movie. This is movie about bad guys. Their point of view. And I am thankful that they still show to us they are bad, even if we are somehow rooting for them to win. Will Smith is great in his roles, and so is everyone else in fact. Even Leto has charming moments when he is on scene with Harley, even though their portrayal isn't really based on comics and point of Joker and Harley was never love. All in all, I could rant about this movie for hours, but, what's the point? If you like DC and want a movie about their bad guys, you will enjoy. If you are looking for a casual fun ride, you maybe won't really be satisfied completely with it. 8.5/10! It could have been better, but in my eyes, it has a unique atmosphere, great cast and it was first who did what it did, so it will always be the best for me! :D",Suicide Squad
208,acedj,The second best DC film this decade,8,14 November 2019,"This film, while not as good as Wonder Woman, is still a very good effort by DC. I don't know why or how, but DC keeps missing the mark with their movies. Suicide Squad was a welcome anomaly.
This movie focuses on a group of DC villains that are recruited for what looks like a suicide mission, hence the title. The military has held a witch captive, but lose their control over her, and she means to lay waste to the world. It is up to this group of people, facing a lifetime in prison, to take her out before her plans come to fruition.
There are quite a few of the bad guys from the world of DC that are featured in this movie, and featured well. Margot Robbie and Will Smith embody their characters of Harley Quinn and Deadshot respectively. Jared Leto's turn as the Joker, while heavily teased in the trailers, amounted to very little screen time, and that was probably for the best as he did not do a very good job at it. The biggest detraction for this movie to me was Cara Delevingne as the enchantress. I do not feel that she is a very talented actress and perhaps another could have done a better job. Still, as far as movies based on DC comics go, this one was very good.",Suicide Squad
209,SkullScreamerReturns,Wacky but a little bit tame,4,4 January 2020,"The idea is great; make an insane team ouf of baddest bad guys and put them against a greater evil. But for some reason it doesn't work very well. It's hard to pinpoint what's the problem. There's just nothing excellent anywhere.The actors are the best part, at least some of them are quite good. Margot Robbie is the highlight as Harley Quinn. That's a character that could have turned out very annoying in the hands of a wrong actress but Robbie is great every time she's on the screen. Also Will Smith does a solid performance as Deadshot. But Jared Leto is the worst-looking Joker ever. Luckily he doesn't have much screentime.The fantasy element is a bit boring. The Enchantress is not familiar to me from any comics so I don't know how the film version compares to the comic character. But in any case my opinion is that with a more down to earth villain the movie would have been better. It goes a bit too much into a fantasy territory with some ancient god-like beings and an end battle reminiscent of the original Ghostbusters. Harley's wooden hammer would have been more useful if the enemy was something more physical. Also the cgi in the magic effects is too extensive and quite bad in my opinion.Overall, the movie is not the worst but it's too meriocre. Considering the amount of interesting characters involved I can't understand why it turned out so indifferent. Except some little moments the movie just doesn't make me feel much anything.Comic book fans will watch it anyway but even if they do that doesn't mean everybody should.",Suicide Squad

211,stevenrotherforth,Almost as disappointing as getting no presents for Christmas!,4,6 May 2017,"Suicide Squad Oh boy, so where do I start with this one? Imagine being a child on Christmas morning hoping that Santa had left you a new bicycle only to find that instead you had been gifted with a nice large lump of coal! That was the immense disappointment i felt after watching this movie. The build up, the teasers, the promising cast. The acclaimed director... Then the eventual end product. A miss mash of ideas. The stupid storyline, the choppy editing. Suicide Squad is all of the above things and more. A wasted opportunity. Such a great concept. The most notorious villains forced to work together to save the world. I won't go into too much about the storyline but I will say it's ludicrous! Giving the rag tag team a real world situation to deal with would have been a much more satisfying movie. I understand that the whole idea is that the world needs an extraordinary set of people to deal with extraordinary threats. But this was like some Ghostbusters spoof made by fanboys. It was hollow. Forgettable and poorly made. No matter how much CGI polish is sprayed on to the movie screen it can't hide this. The villains look as though they were lifted from an old episode of the Power Rangers. All costumed up with tinsel and plastic. Cara Delevingne's Enchantress goes from looking like a belly dancer who has fallen on hard times to some sort of evil sorceress. I swear she spent the second half of the movie looking like she was hula hooping or that someone had poured ants down the back of her knickers. She does this weird twisting and contorting throughout the film which becomes really annoying. The cast though is the saving grace of this movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely superb as Harley Quinn as is Jared Leto's brief appearance as the Joker. I say brief. Don't go into this movie thinking you're going to see a Joker filled fun fest. He gets about as much screen time as Godzilla did in his recent outing. Will Smith as Deadshot is Will Smith playing Will Smith as usual. However he does bring a level of charisma to the movie like only he can. Joel Kinnaman is as robotic as he was in Robocop. Leaving Jai Courtney to challenge Margot Robbie for the scene stealer award. There's an encounter or two with The Batman. Ben Affleck is filling the shoes of Christian Bale as best he can. There's also a dude who looks like a crocodile which sucks for him. The movies climax is really poor as are many a scene that give the impression that they were just tagged on Examples being Harley's elevator fight and the bar room scene. I really didn't like this film and I am a fan of the genre. Movies like the Avengers, The Dark Knight and Logan show what can be done with a good script, good director and a talented bunch of actors. This movie had two out of three of those but fails miserably. Too many moments that leave you tutting at the screen. One example when all The Suicide Squad are battling the Enchantress. She gets caught up in a fist fight only to the say ""Enough!"" and magically disarms them all. If she's so powerful why would she lower herself to the level of bar room brawling? I could go on but I'll just come out and say it. This film was crap! A real disappointment. DC you are going to have to up your game big time. Compared to the quality of the movies Marvel are making you have a long long way to go.",Suicide Squad
212,drpainters,Disappointed,6,29 January 2021,"Joel Kinnaman is the worst actor of the bunch and yet it somehow focuses around his character the most. Really just ruins the movie, I hope his character is killed off quickly in the suicide squad.

213,socrates99,Margot Robbie for President,9,9 August 2016,"The last time a woman wowed me with her bravado was Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver in Kill Bill. Since then no one's even come close until Robbie who is spectacular as the crazed Harley Quinn. Though she's hardly a heroine here, I'd love to see her star in a spin off. Somehow her role gives me inexplicable joy and I was smiling thinking about her a long time after the film was over. What a pleasure! Restores my faith in women! Robbie is wild, gutsy, playful and unforgettable. And pretty much both quirky and gorgeous.Of the rest of the crew I enjoyed the Australian, played by James McGowan, and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag the most. The story is about their origin as a team. And considering how difficult it must be to bring a comic book to life, I can't help admiring this mostly successful effort.",Suicide Squad

All in all i found it quite entertaining despite having to put up with Leto, Harley quinn was a dream as she always is, I hope to see this Harley for a long long time.I highly recommend you watch this, especially before the new reboot!",Suicide Squad
215,Magow-Intermean,Suicide Squad Review,9,23 March 2019,"Machiavellian government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) has a plan to deal with the sudden, Superman-heralded ""metahuman"" threat to the world: coerce the globe's deadliest bad guys into an emergency super-team. And when Midway City becomes the ravaged heart of a plot to extinguish humanity, that's exactly what she does, with expectedly unexpected results.
If Marvel has the best superheroes, so the prevailing geek-logic goes, then DC has the coolest villains. So it's only sensible they're finally placed front, centre and in the firing line. Filling its entire super-team with previously unseen antagonists, Suicide Squad represents a Flash-speed sprint of a catch-up for the rapidly forming DC Cinematic Universe. And, on that front at least, it's a real hoot.It's a real hoot.
Deadshot, ""the most wanted hitman in the world"", is delivered with heat-of-the-action poise and a generous side order of sass by Will Smith, who couldn't look happier stepping back from his above-the-title dominance to join this motley ensemble and coolly put bullets in brains.
Then there's Harley Quinn, the Jokerette, if you like; though ""crazier than him, and more dangerous"", we're warned. Margot Robbie, skipping daintily about in pants hotter than hell's sauna, isn't quite allowed to completely steal this show - but she certainly borrows it from time to time, and repays you with enough interest to make that mooted Harley stand-alone an enticement.
Plus, among others, we have the tinnie-swigging, stick-hurling Captain Boomerang, which finally sees Jai Courtney flexing his rough charisma on screen; and flame-moulding gang-banger Diablo, the team's unlikely conscience in the impressively intense, tat-etched form of Jay Hernandez.
Margot Robbie isn't quite allowed to completely steal this show - but she certainly borrows it from time to time.
It's quite the roll call. And, despite the rich material, director David Ayer is a brave man to marshal this Dirty Half-ish-Dozen. Thinking he was making the ""funny, smart-talking, cool little brother"" to Batman v Superman, he found himself tasked with turning back the wave of negativity that smashed Zack Snyder's Dawn Of Justice.
More used to spelunking in the man-caves of the testosteronic psyche with the likes of End Of Watch and 2014's underrated war movie Fury, Ayer might seem an unlikely candidate to rescue a comic-book blockbuster series, but, like his unpredictable, mismatched characters, he pulls it off with gritty-flashy aplomb.
Well, for the most part. Whatever the truth behind the reasons for additional shooting (standard procedure, or last-minute Deadpool-style humour injection?) you can't help but inhale the sweaty waft of 11th-hour scrambling in what proves to be a scrappy final edit. False starts, oddly placed flashbacks, clunky cameos (Ben Affleck's Batman, Ezra Miller's Flash) and a muddled chronology detract from the grungy, kooky DayGlo-splashed fun, and it takes a good 45 minutes (plus the mystifyingly late introduction of what turns out to be one complete non-event of a character) for the set-up to stop flapping and the action proper to kick in. Also, in striving to find a threat deadly enough to warrant asking bad guys to save the world, the film's answer is less than satisfying. We get little more than just another posturing villain with vague plans for world domination via a big, swirling mass of CGI.
Still, at least elsewhere there's a proper bad guy to chew on. Though only a wild card, occasionally capering in and out of the main plot, Jared Leto's incarnation of the Joker is essential to its success. Where Heath Ledger's version was scarred, shabby and countercultural, Leto's has a smooth, blingy gangsta swagger; a modern take on the way the original comic-book creation riffed on '30s mobsters. But it's not his swish, purring style and elegant, slo-mo cackle that really hooks you, it's something we've never seen before: the Joker in love. Here's a fascinatingly jagged new angle (cinematically at least). It's unsettling and compelling - almost enough to make you wish it were more than a subplot.
But there's more to come, surely? Judging by what Ayer's pulled off here, you can bet there will be.",Suicide Squad

What could have been a gripping ensemble piece about camaraderie among unlikely companions forged in the fires of conflict becomes yet another loud, messy, superficial blockbuster affair. A movie about second chances and an exploration of the minds behind the monsters that are these supervillains dials back on all this potential depth in the name of making itself more ""fun"".From the get go, SUICIDE SQUAD had a tall order to tackle. It had to introduce not one, not two, but a whopping 9 characters into this cinematic universe called the DC Extended Universe or DCEU. Not only that, they had to go from bad guy to good guy and settle their individual character arcs within the span of 2 hours. This is a team movie but we had barely known the team members. In a flurry of disjointed flashbacks and flash forwards, we are brought up to speed on the history of our characters leading up to their current situation as patsies recruited by the ruthless Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to be a black ops task force in the service of the government. Marksman Deadshot (Will Smith), mutated strongman Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), self-blaming pyrokinetic gangster El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), master of ropes Slipknot (Adam Beach), crazy Aussie with a pony obsession (it makes sense in context) Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), crazier little psychopath Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), all led by the stern no-nonsense Captain Rick Flagg and his sword wielding assistant Katana.Immediately apparent is the tremendous chemistry among the cast. Each role is masterfully played and feel exactly like the comic book brought to life. Of particular note are Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and veteran Will Smith's Deadshot. The respective actors nail the various facets of these complex characters perfectly, portraying them as layered individuals hiding their inner brokenness behind a façade of bravado and false smiles. That being said, only Deadshot and Harley get any decent development. The others are relegated to being a supporting cast with barely an arc much less any character depth. A pity though, seeing as how colourful a cast it was, and how intriguing their backstories from the comics were.For their first mission, the squad is sent into Midway City to investigate an apparent terrorist attack. Instead what they find is a supernatural invasion like something out of Ghostbusters. Faceless humanoid zombie things roam the streets while special effects mumbo jumbo continually pours out of a peculiar train station. Slowly it is revealed that there is more to this attack than meets the eye which seems to have a personal connection to one of the squad. But first, they would have to fight their way across the city in some of the messiest, uninspired fight sequences filmed in recent years all set to a bland generic score and shot in a haphazard manner with each frame saturated in garish purple, oily blacks and acid green.Oh and the Joker (Jared Leto) is in this movie somewhere, appearing occasionally throughout the movie like a wheezing Wiley Coyote intent on saving his lost love Harley. We really do not get much about him other than he is a mob boss, kills people, and has a disturbing as heck chuckle. SUICIDE SQUAD is muddled by erratic pacing for the most part, brought about by the sloppy editing that looks more like a music video and less like a movie. Perhaps that was the point when they packed the film full of pop songs from likes of Eminem, Rick James and Skrillex; it is a feature length compilation of music videos in which the characters actually stop for an intermission to get a drink right in the middle of a war.Here is a movie that is unable to decide on its identity, no doubt brought about by the executive meddling that plagued its production. It feels like it was originally a much darker, sombre, character centred movie. Such a film would have been more in line with Director David Ayers' style, having done the brutal war movie Fury. Instead, it is pumped full of dark humour which, though well executed, takes away any complexity or meaningful themes that the movie could have incorporated. It is so superficial that even the camaraderie comes out of nowhere. One moment they are complete strangers, and all of a sudden they are best friends. A character claims that the squad is his new family but nowhere do we see them truly bond.SUICIDE SQUAD is saved mainly by the amazing actors and actresses, bringing our favourite comic book villains to life in a way that makes us want to know more about them, their histories, and their stories. They bring a tremendous energy to the screen and snippets of the characters' development and how the varying personalities play off each other are sprinkled throughout the film. Perhaps if it was not mercilessly butchered by editors, SUICIDE SQUAD had potential to be a great ensemble piece digging deep into an exploration of the criminal psyche and a tragic tale of loss and redemption. Instead it was re-cut into a shallow comedy filled mess with bland directing, murky production design, and ended up with the trailers being better than the movie itself.",Suicide Squad
218,room102,Awful,1,10 August 2016,"My god, that was AWFUL. Just random made-for-trailer tiny scenes that add to nothing, have zero depth and don't make up a coherent plot. Wall-to-wall inappropriate songs that come at random times. Boring plot (if you can even call it that), boring and indistinguishable flat characters. Harley Quinn was annoying. Jared Leto did his best as The Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at random times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and no story. If you've seen the trailers, you basically saw all the one-liners and ""money shots"".If all that isn't enough, the last third of the movie is simply unwatchable.I don't think David Ayer is a bad director (I liked HARSH TIMES and FURY), but this is definitely his worst movie yet and I'm pretty sure it's due to massive pressure from the producers.",Suicide Squad
219,waqassaleem-85201,Eh,5,4 July 2021,The film was strictly average. The movie felt rushed and it didn't amount to anything in the end. Felt like they were just going along while filming and making a script. The castings of the film were perfect. But since the stroyline was faulty and it didn't really matter. Better to just skip this than watch it.,Suicide Squad
220,James_De_Bello,5/10,4,8 August 2016,"Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is convinced that after the arrival on earth of Superman and the discovery of meta-humans, the only way to fight the potential menace of the next threat is to assemble a team of the worst and most powerful criminals in custody and use them as, fittingly, a 'Suicide Squad'. That is when elements like Deadshot, the best killer on earth, (Will Smith), the mad Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) amongst other come in.The reasons to be excited were many, for one the premise and the way it was pitched by Ayer and Warner Bros. to the public sounded really intriguing. The end result is a totally messy film, falling short on many of its promises, a film which even in its ideological statement doesn't know what it's saying, yet that has enough fresh material and good details to not prove to be the disaster it could seem.What Ayer achieves here is managing to make many extravagant characters fit on screen. The fact of making this coherent is both a gargantuan task and one that isn't fulfilled by the movie, but we'll come back to that. You at least have to admire the bravery in trying to bring all of this craziness together and you do because when the film is working, it is working great, the problem is that tonal shifts happen so abruptly and so often there is simply no time to enjoy a film that I think is, for the majority, really enjoyable, but made less so, many many times, by terrible pace, sloppy editing and again, tonal shifts that even make for unpleasant ideology at times.The movie tries to be a serious drama, but its inner core, which is that of a black comedy, is so powerfully clear is struggles to get out and fails to be relevant. A part of this I have to admit has to be blamed on the unnecessary inclusion of the Joker character here. He is completely misused for many reasons, but the worst part is the fact that he takes away a big chunk of time from the flow of the film and disrupts the tone of it. Having a cameo would have been more than fine because he does work in the few flashback scene has, yet his integration into the plot is simply boring. Not to mention the fact that Leto's portrayal is absolutely out of control and does not leave you with anything consistent, proving that the Joker isn't just some mad idiot you pull off by playing crazy and laughing mad on screen, He is a deep character with a serious set of traits that has to be understood and studied.Far less boring is his counterpart: Harley Quinn. Brilliantly portrayed by Robbie, Harley represents everything about what is good in the film. The comedic undertones, the savage nature, the overall arc with the Squad and the chemistry with her companions, especially Will Smith. Those are all the elements that I really enjoyed and grasped from the film. Ayer had a real eye for detail and he managed to pepper the script with thousands of little touches that were gold character beats and proper development of story.Yet then you are reminded of the plot going on and you can't help but frown. The villains in this film are pathetic, both in execution, but even worse in basic set-up. Did anyone of the thousands of people reading the script wonder if another fuc*ing beam creating a portal into the sky was what we needed? And even worse why is the Suicide Squad fighting such a threat in a world where Wonder Woman, Flash and Batman exists. It is beyond me. You had the possibility of doing something really fresh and new, lowering the stakes and making the character conflict come to the forefront and what we end up is another beam in the sky? As much as I was enjoying the little moments I just couldn't believe it, it got me out of the film too many times and the way the resolution works was probably the dullest element of it all, failing to make any of the characters relevant in the scenario...ahem..Captain Boomerang.I was laughing and enjoying myself, there was some real, clever and original banter going on. The sarcasm and dark nature of the characters was working brilliantly, Jai Courtney was stealing the show from Robbie and then Smith would come in and steal it from both of them. And then Amanda Plummer (minor spoiler) shoots four members of her staff. And then suddenly it is OK to be a assassin as long as you love your daughter. The thematic and ideological points are so chaotic I had no idea which way to tackle them.Whilst a definite improvement over Snyder's underwhelming work in the DCU and having some truly remarkable elements and redeemable qualities, ""Suicide Squad"" has too messy of a message and a story to really manage to be the fresh take it promised to deliver.",Suicide Squad
221,scottshak_111,A whole lot of bang with no deafening noise to cover it all up,7,31 August 2016,"Suicide Squad might not be that DC movie you have been impatiently waiting for, and it is highly probable that we are never going to hit that old Nolan high ever again, but it still manages to rope you in with entertainment galore. What is important that we are joining DCEU pieces together, and trying our level best to build something beautiful in the long run. Aren't we really looking up to it? DIRECTION OF SUICIDE SQUAD The problem with David Ayer's direction is that he doesn't retain focus. The guy wouldn't let you pivot on anything. His direction gallops like a speeding steed, and by the time you are trying to put sense into something he canters around to imminent frames to cloud his shoddy direction, without caring about how spectators feel. That's where he goes wrong. What we need is depth, a gorgeous profundity to hold onto something serious, so that we have something to reflect, and possibly tag along to a frequency that keeps us on our toes to meet those elusive frames. Sadly, Ayer doesn't have that tranquility and he storms like Usain Bolt.BEST THINGS WE TAKE Without wasting any time, let's delve into the good the flick had to offer. The best thing about Suicide Squad is hands down Harley Quinn. A one woman show that swallows everything in its wake of perversion. Margot Robbie does justice to our good ol' Harley successfully creating a stunning persona that is probably the most cherishable character we take from Suicide Squad.Another powerful one is that of Will Smith's Deadshot. He has some of the best lines and he delivers too. But still I wished he was built as memorable as the animated character in Batman: Gotham Knight. Watch out for that one man army show though with his unmissable headshots.Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag was a confident affair too. He carries a comportment that will have you believe things were actually serious. Amanda Waller was magnificently built with Viola Davis placing things in perspective. But she melts into immaterialism with a vapid story to back her.THE JARED LETO JOKER David Ayer fails to stun us with a Zack Snyder like theatrics when it comes to depicting fighting sequences, but he still manages to create memorable bits keeping Joker under the wraps. There are cameos of him that are absolutely dazzling, as Jared Leto masters that notorious Joker laugh, thrilling every frame with his occasional presence. There are theatrics entailed, no doubt, but I wished he was given more screen time to create an enchanting scene all for himself. His occasional visits with hooligans in dramatic veils sizzle the screen with pizazz nevertheless.Enchantress was gorgeously carved in the beginning. The part where Amanda Waller introduces her will have you mesmerized by her ghastly transition. But then as the movie progresses on its thinly built plot, she loses the charm and dread of enchanting us, and withers away like a dead flower. The worst part is when you see Cara Delevingne actually dancing as she performs her bewitching acts. Terrible! Another good part was ephemeral Batsy cameos. Wish he had some more unexpected eye-popping bits at odd hours and we would have the whole hall erupting with his occasional presence. The part Zack Snyder shot for Flash was there too and will have you bite your nails for that Justice League movie build up.FOCUSING ON OTHER ASPECTS Other characters in the movie have not been helmed properly. They fall like dominoes without having a proper focus on their abilities except for Diablo played by Jay Hernandez, who gets to have his proper super-villain moment. Incubus walks in strong with his outrageous annihilation in the beginning, but where it all mattered, he succumbs to one of the easiest victories ever.I am afraid, the screenplay has nothing much to offer. There were moments inscribed wherein you would be impatiently waiting for a funny one-liner, and then end up realizing it was already advertised in the trailers before. Side stories to the tale were like inevitable bits that didn't have us feeling sorry for the characters. Those were the things that were highly plausible, and don't reek of enough melodrama to sieve things in perspective.For the better half of Suicide Squad, we have songs that play in the backdrop, that we all have been forever accustomed to. The flick has limited score strewn across that will make you feel how steep the fall really is, coming from Hans Zimmer's gorgeous music in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.SPOILERS AHEADSuicide Squad has fabricated bits too. Like that scene when Harley takes the elevator. It seems a deliberate attempt to create just one scene. To be honest, we could have lived without.Killer Croc and Boomerang get shadowed beyond limit. Slipknot is literally added just for one scene. Is he that expendable? To put it out there candidly, you should watch the animation to witness how beautiful comic helming is done. To experience what the original Suicide Squad was capable of doing you must read the comic or watch the Batman: Assault on Arkham version.Introduction to characters fell far away from the tree as well. It felt sped up as if you were playing some kind of game, and that time was the key factor. With such teensy moments to spare, there was a whole team to cover and it is understandable too. But really we needed some calm there too.THE FINAL VERDICT It goes without saying, DC has a lot of ground to cover. Whilst Suicide Squad might have come out a dud, it was entertaining nevertheless. At the end we still wait with dilated eyes to see what DCEU has in store for us in future.",Suicide Squad
222,colewaters,Suicide Squad,10,11 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a must see movie for all DC fans. This movie has everything that a great movie needs. The film was just not great it also had killer 3D in it. Will Smith was fantastic as Deadshot. Jarod Leto where do I start he was great and Margot Robbie oh my she was fantastic in every way as Harley Quinn. This was just not a movie this was an experience for the whole family. If I had any negatives it would be absolutely nothing.Parents this movie is pushing the PG-13 rating to the point where it should be a R rated film, but it was great besides that parents. Suicide Squad was just not the best film of the year it was the best IMAX 3D film ever. I just want to say that this was the coolest movie and great job Warner brothers. I can't wait for the sequel of this movie because this movie needs one bad. Thanks for reading",Suicide Squad
223,coreyjdenford,Welcome to the Injustice League,4,5 August 2016,"This is my review for Suicide Squad (spoiler free)****(4/5) A lot of people said that End of Watch (2013) writer/director David Ayer was crazy but nobody thought he was this crazy but here it is the craziest superhero/villain movie in existence. Which is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU, and it doesn't take itself too seriously unlike BvS which pretty much just had special effects pizazz to get it's point across, and didn't have any funny dialogue unlike this. Even though in some areas the dialogue is a bit bumpy and could have been better but all is forgiven. Because from the trailer which was released earlier this year and is one of the most viewed trailers on Youtube for movies 2016, it showed that this blockbuster is going to brilliantly bonkers and it is but not too bonkers it still has some serious bits. Which is better than BvS which made people feel more fatigued than there were enjoying it. But enough about that.The story is somewhat okay in this, you can tell it's there but it does fall flat for a few instances and alongside the plot it has the craziness that this Machiavellian crew all have in common. But with the editing it's a little faster due to the executive producer Zach Snyder it's a little darker than normal but that's not to say that, that is a bad thing it just makes the film a bit more serious which is one thing the Suicide Squad shouldn't be especially because in the comics the characters were all nuts, with the insane Harley Quinn as the leader. The characters in this are amazing you can tell that they are taken straight out of the comic book, even with Jared Leto's Joker who isn't part of the Suicide Squad comics just shows to be a formidable force along with the ride. His Joker is brilliant but lacks on thing and that is the purple attire the Joker is famous for but he does rock the 'Damaged' tattoos, also he lacks the insanity of previous Jokers but that's not his fault he still adds a certain efficiency to the story, and at some points makes it better.But the show-runner is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn who looks astonishing in the characters skimpy clothes, and she certainly shows the craziness of the real Harley Quinn straight out of the comic and her one-liners are just hysterical, and one of a kind. However when it comes to the action they all have their special trademark attacks but the one that shows strongest is Will Smith's Deadshot proving to be a better shooter than we last lead to believe he keeps the team strong even when some (Harley Quinn) have their crazy moments. Aside from all the fast-paced action which is amazing by the way it has very good special effects which look absolutely astonishing to match with the purple and green title screen and well it certainly is a strong point of the film. Also one quick thing to add Viola Davis nails her part as secretary Amanda Waller.But on the low side it lacks the origin stories of the characters, the stories are there but they aren't as prominent as I'd hoped, and also they don't last too long and also it looks like the film just cares about the two crazy mains, who are funny which proves that David Ayer can do comedy but it looks like they take the lead way too, the other characters do make an impact though they're left standing like statues. In conclusion even without the stories this is a strong and stern addition to the DCEU and will go down in history as one of the craziest but great DC films. And certainly is better looking and makes you show your sense of humor which is one thing that Zach Snyder lacks.Verdict: A brilliantly bonkers addition to the DCEU filled with enigmatic action and crazy parts that will make even the calmest mind go crazy. Welcome to the Injustice League.8/10 full of energy and action.",Suicide Squad
224,daisukereds,Awful,3,8 August 2016,"There is nothing in this movie that would make me want to watch it ever again. There is not even one ""cool"" scene with good action (which the movie lacked altogether) that I would like to watch again (a la Quicksilver in the recent Fox movies). Clear editing problems, on-your-face pop song tracks, and boring characterization of the criminals of the DC comic books. Another copy of the original Avenger's formula that adds nothing new.-- SPOILERS & Rant ahead! 1 - Killer Croc was a flaccid thug, with a head bigger than his personality (which was non-existent). 2 - Diablo's line ""this is a family"" (paraphrased) is hilarious and probably the best joke of the movie. At no point in the movie I cared for any of these characters nor did they feel like an actual team. 3 - Captain Boomerang getting away after the bar scene and coming back is the stupidest thing.. probably a metaphor of him being an actual boomerang. They attempted to do a joke, but the lackluster team required him to come back for.. no reason. 4 - Every time they show Flash (much like Batman) I hate it even more. Stupid one liners, pompous attitude.. It's nothing like Barry and more like Wally West, a man-child that thinks himself a superhero.﻿ 5 - Not only do we have a murdering Batman.. he is also unable to find and apprehend Deadshot on his own. THE famous Detective needs a tip from the government to find these things out. OH, and he also hides government secrets it seems! Has Comic-book Bruce Wayne ever done something like that? Why do they ALSO know his identity? They don't even understand their characters (example being Cap Boomerang not even having a 'dream sequence' at the end of the movie). 6 - It would have been better to leave the Joker out of this one. 7 - Etc.",Suicide Squad
225,timothygartin,An Average Superhero Movie,5,7 May 2020,"I really liked the characterizations in this movie. The actors did a great job capturing their characters. The problem with this movie is the lack of a story.First, most of the movie is backstory. It takes forever for the actual story to start. I don't think this introductory material is essential to the story about the formation of the team. This material is just character backstory and it gets old.Second, the crisis is entirely the consequence of creating the Suicide Squad itself. The plot is entirely circular. As a result, it trivializes the story.Third, the villains are terrible. I love watching the Enchantress, but she and her brother are easily defeated. They don't make much of a problem for the Suicide Squad. If a real superhero had engaged them, this movie would have been over in one minute.",Suicide Squad
226,poe-48833,Suicide watch...,1,26 April 2017,"There was a time (for me) when a darkened movie house offered Sanctuary from The Real World and all its attendant Horrors; when refuge could be found in Alternate Realities, from the Old West to the depths of Deep Space. Prior to my discovery of alternatives Cinematic, I found escape in the pages of comic books. One eventually gave way to the other, and these days the two are as One. Sorta. For some reason, however, movies these days tend to be far, far LESSER than the comics that inspired them. An odd dichotomy, especially when one takes into account the basic Visual Nature of both. You know the movie's in trouble when a gun-wielding character called ""Deadshot"" can't even put a round through one of the eye-holes or even the unprotected lower half of Batman's face-mask. Later, in a totally pointless (not to mention gratuitously extended) scene, we see this ""dead-eye Dick"" blasting away with an arsenal of firearms. While I'm sure there were weapons enthusiasts who got off on this scene, for the rest of us, there was nothing much going on (a lot of noise, but little else). There are so many such instances throughout this stinker that it's nigh impossible to list them all (so I'm not even going to try). It IS interesting to note that the money-man behind this one was The Foreclosure King himself (Mnuchin the Money Munchkin), whose greatest claim to fame is that he once foreclosed on a 90-year old woman who failed to pay something like 25 CENTS on her mortgage.",Suicide Squad
227,backup-50362,It's so terrible and female-pandering even the director admits he should've focused on the Joker,1,16 August 2016,"In times when pandering to women exclusively is major networks' first amendment, a superhero movie featuring many superheroes oddly chose Harley Quinn (a female knock-off of The Joker - the original freak) to be the main character?Instead of focusing on the most beloved DC character - The Joker - he's barely in the movie. Along with that, the rest of the movie features annoyingly-portrayed, bland characters and muddy, mind-numbing storyline. Only the Mexican fire guy was like-able and realistic as a personality with no fake or overblown pandering traits.They won't learn from their mistakes either, just going harder at it, they're planning 'an all female- superhero DC movie' next as if this wasn't failure enough. The only reason it was successful is because the IP's are strong and people will watch anything with The Joker in it, even if portrayed badly.Obviously no one will top Ledger's Joker but Leto tried and did pretty well, it seems like he really pushed himself and cared about this (as he should have, he knows everyone has high expectations for this character and people will be critical), his efforts however completely went to waste as a generic 'freaky thinks-she's-so-sexy female Joker character' was what they focused on - yes, a bad Harley Quinn that is.She was played bad and bland, as any female-pandering self-entitled female character in any movie is portrayed exactly like this. No original traits or like-ability.And again, DC won't learn from their mistakes - they'll keep trying to push female characters because 'muh pandering and muh female empowerment' and producing disappointing movies until the whole DC movie universe is completely destroyed trough SJW pandering, just like their comics.What a time we live in. I think I'll just re-watch The Dark Knight.Don't reward the next trash they release with your money, learn your lesson from this one and let them fail by simply not paying to watch the next one in movie theaters. It'll be available on-demand for much cheaper soon afterwards anyways.",Suicide Squad

We get it, she's ""hot"", stop making all the guys turn around and look at her ass in every scene after she says a cringy line and walks away, ass in camera.But the worst part is how she was explained to the audience as ""crazier, better, braver, *any compliments* than the freaking Joker"". Did you think female pandering to this degree will make this movie magically good? Cause it sucks.I don't know where to start with Jared's Joker, but I seriously believe he was just written so badly, and designed as such a laughable pimp that no actor could have made this into a good Joker.Just an overall trainwreck.",Suicide Squad

When? And why ?, things are thrown in your face, you just have to accept, not to mention that is externally predictable, cliché, common and after a while is to boring, and the film tries to be funny, it's even in one or two scenes (thanks to Harley Quinn), but overall it's not funny, it's not dark, you do not really know how to frame suicide squad. We were all waiting for the wild card of Jared Leto (which for me is a spectacular actor), and he aprece about 6 minutes into the movie and does not show that to come, and serious?

230,tankace,Review of the later out put of the DC Universe V2,6,3 February 2017,"When Suicide Squad first came out I thought that was OK and enjoyable ,but now after long and hard thoughts I change my mind and saw the mess that it is , although I find some enjoyment watching it, it was more of the type ""It is so bad it's good"" rather than a genuine an appreciation for a good product.But because I am not a negative man out of nature I will start with the things that I liked and were good in the film. Firstly Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was a great casting choice and she was the bossy bureaucrat that comic fan we know and love to hate. Will Smith was good as Deathshot and not with out the usual over acting by his part. Even Jai Courtney made a good job as Captain Boomerang (no clue how but it happened). And also they were some decent action scenes here and there, specially in the middle. And that's all the good.As for the drawbacks wow boy does it have a lot and I can't recall them all so I will point out the obvious and most prominent. For starter where the character development? There is almost none. Then there is Harley Quin and the new Joker. Margot Robbie dispute the fact she did her best her Harley was quit obnoxious in the end.Not that I blame Robbie for that she was trying and with a better script could can excellent so keep her! As for the Joker he was in for what a quarter of an hour and this isn't the Joker, it was his loser cousin for Pim my Ride. And in the end I see no squad no team ,no camaraderie, nothing ,we haven't a real team. To go with the technical aspects effects were on part with those of Gods of Egypt ,that hurt much my eyes.To continue sometimes I couldn't tell what was happening during the fights due to the editing ,the coloring (which was dirty and ugly to look at) and the lighting. To close the technicalities I muss address the editing ,damn it was quit broken and uneven but I won't blame the directorial team for they had only six weeks to write the script and edit the film so they had their hands full.All in all the third film in the DC cinematic universe wasn't very good and over all continues the trend of DC sucks. For real Warner Bros. and DC pull your head from your ass and make a good flick.",Suicide Squad
231,vjnambu,Watch it for harley quinn,6,22 June 2020,"The highlight of suicide squad is none other than margot robbie as harley quinn. She is funny, insane, badass and damn SEXY. She could even overshadow a big superstar like will smith (it won't be a surprise if you forget that there was will smith after watching the movie).
But thats it. The story has nothing new to offer, script was below average, there is no character development apart from deadshot and harley quinn, no chemistry among the team and jared leto's joker was nothing but a pain in your eyes but still he could be forgiven because his character wasn't really important in the story. Batman's cameo also doesn't make it any special.
Despite all these flaws, suicide squad was a passable entertainer which does not bore you at all. Just watch without expecting too much.",Suicide Squad
232,fciocca,How a superhero movie should be made,7,22 October 2019,"At the beginning we are introduced to the Suicide Squad. Presentation sequences for all the members are not long, but detailed enough to understand the origin of every ""villain"", and more information will be added along the movie. The cast is composed by great names, Will Smith and Margot Robbie are the two that pops immediately in my head, but also Jay Courtney as Captain Boomerang with his scottish accent, and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo performed pretty good.Jared Leto's Joker deserve a different paragraph. I don't really know what to think about it: there were some moments during the movie in which I found him brilliant, but most of the time it seemed too forced in his acting and not at all convincing. I have to admit that I have watched this movie after ""The Dark Knight"" (I don't think that there are any words that can describe how amazing was Heath Ledger) and the Joaquin Phoenix's ""Joker"" 2019 movie. I perfectly understand that are completely different, darker. Maybe they wanted to create something closer to the pop culture and they wanted to play a little bit safer this time. However, I can't say that I appreciated the interpretation: the character is annoying and I could not bound with, or feeling any kind of emotion for him.There is a good mix between CGI and stunts scenes and in general, under this perspective the entire movie is very balanced. We get to see the right amount of destruction (that needs to be there in a superhero movie), but at least they did not raze to the ground an entire city like in 2013 ""Man of Steel"". The fight scenes seems credible and dynamic, but the movie leave also space for some dialogues between characters, developing them, even though not everyone has the importance that should have, like Killer Croc. He seems that he does not have any personal story, and he was left aside, so you almost forget is part of the team.Suicide Squad is a big step forward compared to the other DC movies and is worth your time, it feels different, looks amazing, with of course some weak points, and I never thought that I could give seven stars out of ten to this movie.

Alternatively, more to the point, what positive observations can be said of this extremely hyped and over-sold movie? Well, not a lot apparently. This is not a writers' concern here, meaning that what we see here on Screen from this particular genre is to be expected, and it really is not too heavy to digest nor is it surprising and innovative. No, what we have here is a visual bombastic overload; too over-produced and too much going-on to make any smooth and even sensibility. The whole escapade begs too many questions as to point out that the graphics, in part also, the visual narrative and its projection, are simply too messy that, in turn, only deprives the viewer from any pleasure it tries to convey. This then, sadly, turns the final feel and mood of the whole experience into a what-could-have-been to shame-about-that and resets the tone from hyped monster to nothing more than a Dirty Dozen retrospective with migraine inducing illustration. The premise is a simple affair that really does not hold too much weight for character development and only gives us a skimming of background development to just keep the level of interest in motion, typical of this genre. The overuse of Rock and Pop tracks are poorly placed and badly timed to the point of distraction and is extremely irrelevant in areas that really do not hold contention. Where this may have been an interesting guise, at least, and in some part it just pulls it off. Overall there is soundtrack saturation to only bug and bore the viewer insofar that it seems that this tact not only tries to explain the narrative further it seems, at worst, to patronise the viewer as to make them seem incapable as to fully understand the narrative without an extra source. On the positive, there are some moments that are worthy of merit, and this is seeing Mr. Smith enter this genre, and making a good show too boot, there seems to be a close level playing field with egos that does not tarnish this project. With the Poster Girl for this movie is the eye-catching Margot Robbie that add both glamour and humour to set the mood and the spine-chilling Viola Davis that brings a grimly posture to the proceedings which each carries the film onward and upward. It is not a too bad a movie, and it really will be seen once more, but what does let it down is that the graphics', and soundtrack, within certain areas, are trying too hard, too quickly and too vigorously.",Suicide Squad
234,Puroo,The worst DCEU movie thanks to studio meddling,2,5 April 2021,"I'll get this straight - I didn't know what Suicide Squad was before this movie came. When it first came out I thought it was just another action movie. But later I got to know that Joker will also be in it then I realised it's a DC movie. And not just any other DC movie, it's a follow-up to Batman v Superman. I watched this movie only to see Joker, and guess what? It's the only thing I didn't get to see. Then I watched it a second time after getting my facts clear. And guess what? I still didn't like it.I thought Suicide Squad is supposed to be something I'm too immature to understand about, but then I saw Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay, an episode from Season 2 in Arrow where the Suicide Squad is shown, and the trailers of both The Suicide Squad and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Turns out it's an excellent story, which got completely butchered thanks to studio meddling and poor character design.The characters are straight up awful. Only Harley Quinn and Deadshot were good, and that's saying something because in reality Killer Croc is my favourite character out of them all. I hated Katana the most, since she seemed to have a plot armour and yet she didn't help in anything. Amanda Waller was absolutely hateable because of how she behaved. Amanda is supposed to be a jerk, yes. But she doesn't kill her own people. And Captain Boomerang. Oh my God, how they massacred my boy! The other characters like Rick Flag, I don't even know who they are, and the movie gave me no reason to care about them.The villains, however, were awesome. I was rooting for them, because they looked and behaved way better. Even their henchmen were cool. I wanted them to beat up the Suicide Squad and show them their place. But sadly it's a generic good guys win and bad guys lose movie, so I had no other option but to deal with it.Many people are saying that if The Ayer Cut is released this movie will become good. I want to ask them, do you think The Ayer Cut is something like The Snyder Cut? No, it will be more like Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition, with only added runtime to explain everything and give more runtime to Joker, but it won't change the director's original vision. That will still remain the same. I may care about the characters more, but the fact that Katana and Harley Quinn have a plot armour and that no one died except Captain Boomerang won't change.Although I'm no expert, so I do want The Ayer Cut to release. I will watch it and then I may come back to change my review. But for now, it's gonna be a bad movie for me.",Suicide Squad
235,DeBBss,The most epic movie of 2016.,6,22 August 2016,"I watched this movie a week ago, but I'm lazy. So let's begin.The characters. 9/10Harley Quinn, I really liked the look for Harley Quinn, I just hated the cartoon version of Harley, with the jester look. She also has a couple of tattoos, which I also like.The Joker, some people hated the Joker, but personally I liked the new joker, he was a thug like appeal, which I think looks best for the joker.Deadshot, Deadshot is really cool and they made Deadshot have some heart in him and can do some nice things, I like how he's trying to do good, so that his daughter can trust him.El Diablo, one of my favorite characters, El Diablo killed his family and wants his redemption and have a 2nd shot at everything, he then dies, but hes proud.Killer Croc, Croc is not that tall which I don'y like, I want a 7ft tall croc instead of a 6ft croc.Captain Boomerang, I like captain Boomerang, because hes funny and manipulating, you'll see why.Slipknot, Slipknot dies early, because Captain Boomerang manipulated him into running and get his head blown up.Enchantress, Enchantress has a dark and mysterious look which I like, there's not much to say about her.The Story. 8/10The story is casual, kill the bad guy (enchantress) the squad starts to bond and trust each other, and I like that, and it shows that the characters are not dull, but interesting how they cooperate, the joker appears sometimes trying to rescue Harley, Deadshot and Harley have a very strong relationship, again they did a very strong job with the characters.The Action. 10/10Great action scenes and one of the most entertaining boss fight I have every seen, I was entertained from the begging to the end, and some movies have cheap action scenes and try to be epic.The Comedy 5.5/10It breaks my heart that the comedy isn't it's suit, I really want everything to be perfect, sometimes when there's a joke it wasn't funny so it was quiet and awkward.Some people are biased doing reviews because of it's ratings, and sometimes I'm biased, but I really enjoyed the movie, so it's a 9/10 don't listen to the critics, its a really fun movie to watch. -Thanks...",Suicide Squad
236,jawneyfloros,a great concept destroyed,2,21 November 2018,Review: I was really disappointed with this movie because I expected a lot more from a supervillain concept. The direction was sub-par. The screenplay was disappointing especially by the lack of Joker and Harley Quinn but huge amounts of every other villain. The casting and acting were both sub par but Margot Robbie stands above everyone else as Harley Quinn. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.,Suicide Squad
237,DuskShadow,"It was not quite at all like the comic, but totally Hollywood style",7,6 August 2016,"So aside from having big willy smith in this film as deadshot, which would explain why he could not be bothered to be in independence day, jered leto portrays the joker , in what fans, since the first trailers were out lat year, have dubbed a travesty.Now in all fairness the joker is a hard character to do, and leto kinda sounded awesome playing him, and was okay to watch, for a modern, methed out gang banger version of the arch villain.Without Harley quinn occasionally being scantily clad, baring most of her two little petite cupcake cheeks, this would have been worse.Oh and captain boomerang is certainly not supposed to be the most buff one in the group, aside from killer croc, whom in actually replaced King shark as the lead meat head muscle tank in the actual comics. This was way outta hand and poorly replicated the attempts by the shadowy government liaison, Amanda Waller, to pull an M Knight Shamalayab. The premise should have sooner lead to something that made more sense, but of course Hollywood panders to the dumbest wannabe new age fan person or average jane and leaves a bad taste in ones mouth and the horror of time wasted in ones mind. Tickets now a days at your average theater cost 12.50 usd. That don't help none. So as my well read comic aficionado friends and my own self knew, this was not too good, but we gave it a shot. Don't expect Justice league to be any better, because DC or most comic companies that remain active, don't do things in ANY medium true justice any longer. PE@CE and save your cash, just stream it if you must.5-5.8/10",Suicide Squad
238,DuskShadow,Seen the regular Version... But Extended is a whole no Film Experience!,7,13 June 2019,"I think I made a review once before, and I may have also said this: but 11 minutes more , in the extended edition, is the difference between a low 6 and a solid 7. Just more action, fully character lines and development. And just more enjoyable. Even when I saw this in theatres, my friend and I swear it was cut down even more, to under 2 hours. But extended is the way to go. Still enjoyable, the characters are still fun, especially as an old school Dc fan, and those 11 minutes moved this film up a notch in my book. 7/10",Suicide Squad
239,TheHonestCritic,"In the case of the title, there should always be a squad like that present when attempting to view this ""film"".",4,7 March 2021,"""Suicide Squad"" (2016), as usual, the DC Extended Universe has shot itself in the foot, yet again. Just when you think the modern day DC films can't possibly get any worse, they prove you wrong. This is one of the worst DC superhero movies of all-time. Seriously, it's so bad that I almost couldn't finish it! It's so terrible that it's actually obnoxious. Wow, that's such a rare combination for a bad film, obnoxiously boring! This ""film"" has a predictable and dull storyline, average to horrible acting, and a generic cliched soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot is, a secret government agency recruits imprisoned super villains for dangerous assignments and missions. If the Suicide Squad is successful, then their prison sentence will be shortened. That's actually not that bad of an idea for a plot. The only issue is, that storyline very similar to the one in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). In that movie, a group of prisoners break out of jail and form a team to stop a group of extraterrestrial criminals. Now, keep in mind, I'm not saying that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a good film, I'm honestly not a fan of it at all. But, it has a much better understanding of it's original source material and it was executed more smoothly than this ""movie"". It did that plot first, ""Suicide Squad"" pretty much copied it and just tweaked the script to make it a different scenario with the same recycled plot. On top of that, ""Suicide Squad"" is lazy, annoying, boring and you just keep wishing that it would just end already! Like I've said, the concept had great potential. But, poor writing and execution kept it from shining on the screen. As far as the acting goes, it's overall just a total letdown. However, there are two performances in this ""movie"" that stand out above the rest: Will Smith as Floyd Lawton/Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Doctor Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn. Those two really put forth the most effort with their performances. Usually, if Will Smith is in a film, then great acting is usually a given from him. Margot Robbie really nails her respectable character. Had the ""film"" put a little more focus on the two of them, then it might have been more on the right track. Probably the worst acting in this ""movie"" comes from Jared Leto as the Joker. Out of all the live action depictions of the Joker, he is definitely, by far, the worst actor to ever play that character. The rest of the actors and actresses are just average to terrible. Finally, the soundtrack by Steven Price is a huge disappointment. Granted, there are some parts that are decent. Some of the song choices are good, but all-in-all, it's not memorable otherwise and it's really nothing to write home about at all. Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are very well-done, which is no surprise, being a film made in 2016. ""Suicide Squad"" is complete and total waste of film making and one of the absolute worst DC superhero movies. Still, to this day, I'm amazed that I somehow managed to sit all the way through it from beginning to end! I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Bottom line, just stay away from ""Suicide Squad"". If you do attempt to watch it, you better make sure that you have the Suicide Hotline on speed-dial! Seriously, this ""movie"" is really that bad.",Suicide Squad
240,gavinp9,Not a bad comic book movie,7,2 January 2018,"'Suicide Squad' is on par with 'Batman v Superman' (if you didn't mind that, you won't mind this and if you hated that, you probably won't like this either) and the film acts as its sequel and a stop-gap until 'Justice League' comes out next year. It's also DC trying to compete with Marvel's 'Deadpool' which was MA and about an antihero who kills people - although this is only rated M. Still, a few people are killed and there's plenty of violence, but it probably has more in common with 'Ghostbusters' than 'Deadpool'.The film does a great job of introducing the characters in the first 20min, with everyone getting their own song and ""profile"", and each of them gets a bit of backstory as the film progresses - Deadshot (Smith, an assassin), Harley Quinn (Robbie, Joker's girlfriend, in those amazing ""pants""), Joker (Leto, with his metal teeth making him sound a little like Ledger), Boomerang (Courtney, doing his best Tom Hardy in 'The Revenant' impression), Diablo (Hernandez, pretty much Human Torch), Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Enchantress (Delevingene, a witch). There should've been more of how Batman (Affleck) put them all in prison, but he only gets 2min screentime, and the Joker not much more - obviously setting up a Joker v Batman film somewhere down the line. Waller (Davis) is the true villain and she manipulates well to get this ""team"" together and ""controlled"" by Flag (Kinnaman) to go on a rescue mission, that soon turns into a suicide mission.The main issue is the ""ultimate"" bad guy is one of them - Enchantress. She creates a swirling vortex-thing that we've seen a million times and they have to stop her. The problem is the same for all superhero films - why not call in the rest of the heroes? In this case, where are Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash? The tone is sometimes light and funny, but then gloomy and ""we're still the bad guys and are still probably going to die"" the next. It doesn't ruin the film, but sometimes makes it hard to read. The soundtrack is great throughout and often keeps the tone fun. The action and fight scenes are done well, but the film probably outstays it's welcome by 10min. No one, even Smith, hogs too much screentime and it definitely doesn't always work, but is a mostly fun ride.",Suicide Squad
241,thebricks,One scene absolutely ruined this movie for me,1,18 July 2017,"Let's be honest, it was just a bad movie. Jared Leto's Joker may have been the worst ever. How do you screw this role up? He played the Joker as some scummy wannabe rapper. Unbelievable stuff. This is the sort of thing that had to come out of a corporate focus group.Much of the production, action scenes and stunts were terrible and dated. It was like watching a 90's movie. How awful is David Ayer at film making? Seriously. It's like going back in time, watching the sets in this film. It looks like one of those old Universal theme park rides from back in the day.But let's get to the one scene that just made me want to walk out. It's when Amanda Waller kills the FBI agents in the Tact Ops office. One reason I hated it is because it's classic David Ayer. He HATES authority and thinks everyone in power is working for the devil. Look at all of his movies. There's a theme. Maybe he met one dirty cop in his life. Who knows? This is how he portrays ANYONE who works for the government, as the right hand of Satan. It's juvenile.Secondly, the reaction of everyone to the massacre was one big joke. Rick Flagg is supposed to be the Boy Scout Special Ops soldier and he's rather ""oh well"" about it. Will Smith is impressed and thinks it's cool. It's messed up and contradicts the writer's development of these characters. I couldn't take it seriously anymore. I found it unbelievable that Waller could get away with that, nor could I see WHY she did it, considering the cat was out of the bag about everything, anyways! Also, wouldn't you think, ""Hey, maybe she'll do this to me very soon?""I will never see another film Ayer makes, ever again.",Suicide Squad

The problem with ""Suicide Squad"" is cramming so many relatively obscure villains in one movie; the necessary backstories are rushed – just enough to give context.""Suicide Squad"" would have been a lot better as a long-form Netflix series, with more time to establish characters and gradually set the stakes for a big finale.There are some decent cameos from Ben Affleck's Batman and Ezra Miller's The Flash but the humour (apparently inserted after the BvS backlash) feels forced at times.Hopefully ""Suicide Squad 2"" can fix the mistakes of the first film.",Suicide Squad

it wasn't a nice movie , it's never been a movie about the superheroes' enemies gathering and fighting another evil.So this movie was very curious.I didn't like the scenes of the film, some scenes didn't like what I could say very ridiculous.",Suicide Squad
247,kermitkid,Not sure what the critics were smoking,9,18 September 2016,"DC is finally learning that comic book movies can (and should) be fun. Through trial-and- error they are listening to the fans complaints and addressing them and improving with each movie. ""Man of Steel had too much action? We'll tone it down a bit in Dawn of Justice. Dawn of Justice wasn't fun enough? We'll do reshoots on Suicide Squad to make it more lighthearted."" It will still be a while before they catch up to Marvel, but for now I'm pleased with how they're trying. Although the characters look very different from the versions we are used to they still feel like the characters. There was never a point where I felt like Jared Leto and Margot Robbie's portrayals of Joker and Harley were not those characters. (Unlike Jesse Eisenburg as Lex Luthor in ""Dawn of Justice"".) Even the characters I'm not as familiar with like Deadshot and Killer Croc were still great. Will Smith and Joel Kinnamen were the most fun performances to watch next to Robbie and Leto. Even if you're not a comic fan, it's still fun just as a movie. The exposition/origins of the various characters don't take up too much time and gets those who may not be familiar with these characters up to speed. It's not even really a comic book movie, it's a human redemption story. Other than Joker and Harley the rest of the Squad aren't necessarily bad people. They've just made some bad decisions, but they're willing to repent. Deadshot doesn't want to kill for money anymore, Diablo feels he should not have his prison sentence shortened because he feels prison would be the safest place for him since he doesn't know how to control his powers and doesn't want to accidentally kill people anymore. I feel sympathy for these characters and loved how they were willing to change and redeem themselves. The one complaint I have is the villain in the third act was a bit weak and could have been improved with better writing. But considering WB/DC forced the writers to crank out the script in 6 weeks this was still better than it should have been. This has all the fun of a Marvel movie. (It reminded me most of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", especially the various songs played throughout the movie. It's one of the best soundtracks of the year.) and I'm excited to see what DC does with future movies. Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",Suicide Squad
248,Rendanlovell,Mindless nonsense,2,7 August 2016,"DC is in a bit of a bad spot right now. After the colossal backlash to 'Batman V Superman' they decided to put all their eggs into one basket. That basket being 'Suicide Squad'. I'm gonna say it right now. If this movie represents the DC movies we are going to get in the next few years, they need to quit now. Because this film is quite honestly one of the worst comic book movies I have seen in the last decade. Now, I have something of a rep for hating on the Marvel films. But nothing they have made even comes close to the garbage fire that is this movie. But lets start at the beginning. The film opens with Viola Davis at a meeting with a couple of expendable government dude bros.She sits them down and tells them that she wants to gather a group of bad guys together as a silver bullet just in cause something really really bad happens. And what do ya know? Something really really bad happens. The rest of this movie. I'm not joking when I say that this is on the same level as last years 'Fant4stic'.There is so much wrong with this film that it physically hurt to sit through it. Unfortunately I didn't realize this earlier or I would have walked out of the theater. And I have never walked out of a movie in my life. But I should've seen it coming. Because right away, it's bad. The first twenty minutes of the film are filled with exposition dumps the likes of which I have never seen.Viola Davis's character literally sits at a table and tells a couple dudes the names, abilities, and backstories of almost all the villains featured in the movie. Twenty minutes of nothing. Twenty minutes of time wasted on something that can effortlessly be written into conversation through out the movie. And that's the biggest issue with this film. ​ The writing is so incredibly awful. Not only can Ayer seemingly not write a convincing character but he can't even write a coherent story. This movie is all over the freaking place. First they get the bad guys together to stop some glowing Egyptian dudes but not really. They actually go into some rando building to do a thing that makes no sense. And along the way they get into slow mo fights between literal piles of trash.Then they have to go do something else and then something else. Completely ignoring the orbital drill plunging into the sky, which may as well have spelled doom in mid air. As they went about doing nothing the film attempts to give them some shred of personality by force feeding us through flash backs. At completely random times someone would just have some stupid flash back that was irrelevant to anything happening.It was moments like these that made the films re-shoots glaringly obvious. There are scenes that come out of no where and as soon as they finish the movie gets going again. Like a scene with Harley Quin fighting trash guys in an elevator. She fights these nothings and then an actual story scene happens. Or in the subway scene when army man gives creepy girl a bomb and she arms it and takes off. The army man said it had a 2 second timer but it doesn't go off. She arms it, leaves, the timer shows one, and the scene cuts away. Everyone is fine and it's never brought up again.This happens so much through out the film it's painful. They just have flash backs and fight scenes for no reason at all. And whenever one of these fights comes up it's impossible to tell what is going on. The direction and editing is so choppy that things and people seemingly appear out of no where and sometimes just disappear again. Without the excessive use of slow-mo these scenes would be nothing more than shapes and colors moving around on a screen.I have so many problems with this film that it's impossible to put them all into a short review like this. The only reason I don't give this film the lowest score I can possibly give is because the cast gives solid performances. That is it. Every other aspect of this movie is utter nonsense. The story is all over the place, the characters are flat as boards, it's horribly unfunny, the direction and cinematography is by the numbers, and every ounce of logic seems stripped away. Not to mention how bad the soundtrack is. It cuts from pop song to cookie cutter nonsense from scene to scene, not caring about what the context of the scene is. 'Suicide Squad' wastes it's talented cast and will waste two hours of your life if you bother to see it.",Suicide Squad

I would say in terms of performances, margot Robbie is awesome playing Harley as someone who captures the character as someone who is crazy but a sweet innocent deposition. Jared leto is sadly underused as the joker but he does manage to do well with the screen time given.

That is, some well written roles, had it been true with all the characters in this movie, this would've been a real masterpiece, but all too often it did fall short of the quality performance of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Joel Kinnaman. there are a few other solid performances which didn't get their characters developed enough to shine like these three, especially Viola Davis who's very good as the perfect government agent that sees nothing but getting their job done, but truth is her role is too one dimensional, and there was room for real depth here. Same is true with Jai Courtney and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Jared Leto, isn't bad in his role, but it's hardly a role to speak about, and he was hyped from here to forever, so it was a letdown. But the roles that were properly written were really superb and the three actors I mentioned did them great justice.

254,ExpendableMan,Harley Quinn deserves a better film,4,28 February 2017,"Sloppily edited and veering wildly in tone, 'Suicide Squad' is a textbook example of what can go wrong when you try to change the mood of a film halfway through making it. The darkened streets, depressed characters, murderous senators and constant rain give it an especially grim atmosphere. With David 'Fury' Ayer directing, it's clear this was originally meant to be a brooding and cynical film, but every now and then someone will drop a one-liner, or the soundtrack will liven up with 'Ballroom Blitz.' It's almost as if they were verge of calling it finished when someone in Corporate Headquarters decided the burgeoning DC Movie Universe needed it's own 'Deadpool' and called for urgent re-shoots to make it more fun. If so, this was a dreadful mistake. The majority of 'Suicide Squad' is miserable, po-faced and moodier than a fair-weather Goth kid who just spent a weekend reading Nietzche and binging on Opeth albums. The titular squad are essentially a comic book version of The Dirty Dozen, a group of expendable assets brought together to do the Government's rotten jobs in a world where super-powered humans can demolish skyscrapers with their fists. And almost all of them are completely depressed. Deadshot (Will Smith) for example, is a lethal assassin who's killed enough people to fill a football stadium but who really just wants to see his kid again. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) is a heavily tattooed gang member who can summon fire from his fingertips but is tormented by the death of his family, while Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) is the utterly humourless leader. Granted, in the mission against a crazed Sorceress that takes up most of the movie, he does have a lot to lose, but does he really need to spend so much time furrowing his brow and musing on whether they're doing the right thing?The Government Agents who set up the team meanwhile are ruthlessly sadistic and motivated entirely by self-interest. They're corrupt, murderous and just as bad as the supposed villains. It's a horribly cynical view of the world, but it's not convincing. It's so completely devoid of hope and humanity that 'Suicide Squad' winds up feeling like it was written by depressed 4Chan members. The world is hell man, you snowflakes just don't get it. But strangely, this shadowy and oppressive misery-marathon has the most upbeat and jovial soundtrack this side of 'Guardians Of The Galaxy.' Unlike Peter Quill's mix-tape however, the music here just does not work. None of the songs match what is happening on screen, they're just shoe-horned in haphazardly. Everybody likes 'Bohemian Rhapsody' right? Stick it over some of the prison scenes, 'no escape from reality' totally fits.However, 'Suicide Squad' isn't entirely without merits and there are a couple of decent moments to be found. Some of the acting is pretty good too, Will Smith manages to be effortlessly watchable even when he's in a bad mood, while Jai Courtney actually manages to make his antipodean answer to Snake Plissken likable. Shame he's called 'Captain Boomerang' and has been saddled with a truly rubbish gimmick, he makes a good antihero when not playing square- jawed heroes.If the film absolutely gets one thing right though, it's Harley Quinn. From the minute she first appears, sitting in a homemade hammock in the middle of an isolation block and flirting murderously with her guards, Margot Robie's performance is spot-on. She's equal parts psychotic and childish, as memorable as Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in 'The Dark Knight' and they couldn't have picked a better actress to play her. 'Suicide Squad' might be a long way from perfect, but it does create an instant icon and it's no surprise that 2016 saw legions of lookalikes turning up at Halloween parties.As good as Robie is though, it's impossible to deny that 'Suicide Squad' is a bad film. It's a massive missed opportunity and can't make up it's mind if it wants to be free-wheeling comic anarchy or a deep, tormented soul. Imagine watching a dismal stand-up comedian who looks suspiciously similar to a wanted murderer for two hours and you'll get the idea. It's made enough money to fund a real super-villain however so a sequel is inevitable, let's hope it's better than this turgid effort. Margot Robie really is good though.",Suicide Squad
255,themadmovieman,"Watchable, but a generally disappointing and empty affair",7,6 August 2016,"You'd think that a film with no less than nine major characters would be jam-packed, even overstuffed. That was a problem for DC with just four players in Batman v Superman, so I was hugely surprised to see what an empty film Suicide Squad is. Despite a decent start, the film descends into generic blockbuster territory, and we never get the zany, manic entertainment that the premise suggests.However, before I get into what disappointed me so much about this film, I want to touch on the best part: the performances. For all the mistakes that David Ayer's screenplay and directing make, the lead actors do a great job at injecting some life and energy, with Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Joel Kinnaman putting in both an impressive, and most importantly of all, entertaining show throughout.In fact, the strong performances make for some a good few enjoyable moments throughout, moments that save this film from being a total mess. When we're not focused on the overall plot, and in fact centre on the members of Suicide Squad either quarrelling or banding together, there's a lot of fun to be had. The contrasting personalities make for some pretty entertaining clashes, and the fact that there are so many characters gives good variety too, which I was very glad to see.Apart from that, however, Suicide Squad comes off as a bit of a nothing film. For starters, the story is almost entirely stationary for the first twenty minutes. The characters of course need some background to set up the film, but that can be done whilst advancing the story along. Anyway, the first act isn't that bad in comparison to the rest, as we do get some good insight into the characters, and a good few laughs too.What really disappointed me about this film is its main plot. A generic premise it may be, with a group of characters going to defeat a powerful being, but what you need to make that work is fast pacing, good humour, and entertaining action, and Suicide Squad had none of that.Apart from the fact that the film features one of the least threatening (and often most laughable) villains ever put to the big screen, given the way that the villain ends up standing in a building flailing their arms about for the entire movie, the story essentially features a team of a dozen or so people walking through a dark city, only with the goal of defeating a faceless and uninteresting adversary.The few moments of squad joviality did make for good fun, but that just didn't save my interest given the way that the film simply watches them move slowly through the city, with such little tension. I tried to keep my spirits high, and I expected the craziness to ramp up towards the final act, but I was so saddened to see how the film continuously got worse and worse, and never managed to provide a truly exciting and entertaining blockbuster experience.Another thing that the film promised was Jared Leto's Joker, so let's talk about him for a second. On the plus side, Leto makes a very menacing villain, and I'm hugely excited to see him tackle Batman or others in a future film. However, Leto's rather serious and dark performance feels hugely out of place in this movie. Suicide Squad attempts to interject humour amongst its dullest periods, but that really clashes with Leto's Joker, who seems much more at home in a gritty gangster thriller.Finally, I want to talk about David Ayer. Ayer is a great director, and made films like Fury and End Of Watch. Unfortunately, his rather gritty directing style feels very much at odds with both his more comical screenplay, and DC's typical visual palette. Ignoring the emptiness of the plot for a moment, Ayer's normally visually thrilling style is undermined by a greyish and dull colour palette, whilst the more intense action moments (which worked beautifully in his other films) don't work when the film tries to be funny too.Overall, I was very disappointed by Suicide Squad. It's a film that first and foremost lacks a strong screenplay, but is also a mess given its failed mixture of comedy, grit and action. On the whole, I felt Suicide Squad was a generally dull and empty blockbuster, and only the strong lead performances brought a glimmer of the craziness that we all expected.",Suicide Squad
256,kaptenvideo-89875,Makes you wish that everybody died so there'd be no sequels or spinoffs,4,13 September 2017,"I find most superhero movies too generic and soulless to enjoy them but Suicide Squad"" gives this description a whole new meaning. Not a single f*** was given during watching this meaningless action adventure which gives us a bunch of DC Comics's superheroes incarcerated for their crimes who save the world to get some years off. By the way, for once, the general response to the superhero movie has been similar to mine, suggesting to not waste your time. They battle some superhuman force which looks as mysterious and grand as something straight outta some children's movie. Even most of the superheroes themselves are neither cool nor interesting in any way. Except, maybe, Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), who also have the most lines, including all the best ones. Also appearing, Viola Davis diving straight for the paycheck this time, Jared Leto as Joker (original but toothless rendition of this great character), Joel Kinnaman, Jay Hernandez, Karen Fukuhara et al. Almost everything feels devoid of creativity or fun in this movie. Where did they spend the huge 175 million dollar budget? The result doesn't even look pretty or have gripping action scenes. Avoid! And maybe avoid the inevitable sequel(s) too, because they surely are coming. For all the hate Squad"" has gathered from critics and superhero afficionados and the regular moviegoers, it still managed to bring 745 million U.S. dollars from cinemas. How is it even possible? I can't believe this was written and directed by David Ayer, the man who gave us Harsh Times"", End of Watch"", and Fury"" (also wrote Training Day"" and Dark Blue""). None of the good qualities he usually seems to possess are evident here. Let's hope his upcoming Netflix fantasy action Bright"" also starring Will Smith is much much better! Watched an extended cut which adds 11 minutes for total of 134. Now want the two hours of my life back.",Suicide Squad

Saving grace in the form of Margot Robbie carries the entire movie on her shoulders for a while, but there is only so much one can do when it is weighed down by poor editing, generic script and uninventive plot. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), a clandestine Government agent puts together a team of imprisoned supervillians to participate in dangerous covert missions in exchange for lenient prison terms. When one of the recruit June Moone a.k.a. the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) goes rogue and threatens to destroy the Earth (Duh!), the team comprising of Deadshot (a bored Will Smith), Harley Quinn (an excellent Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) dubbed Task Force X led by decorated Commander Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). Once off the leash, will they resort to their evil ways or fight as a team they were hoped to?There are definitely some positives compared to the dull and gloomy Batman vs. Superman debacle - cheeky one-liners, a very original and different take on Joker by Jared Leto, a superb rendition of Harley Quinn by Margot Robbie, par visual effects and not too many dull phases. There were two main failures and a number of sub-failures - a run-of-the- mill plot, sub-par villain, under-cooked backstories and farce of a climax. It could have had a slightly positive effect had it released 5 years ago, but that's not the case and it already looks dated. The charismatic superstar Will Smith is reduced to a side-kick and doesn't even have as much screen time or presence as Margot Robbie which is surprising but not out of place.

There is only a few action time in over 2 hours, about 15 minutes and it's not great at all.There are many bad parts but the ones I notice are : batman appears for like 20 seconds and what is his purpose?

Whatever DC will shine soon.",Suicide Squad
260,nicolechan916,Insanity,8,18 February 2017,"The suicide squad has been around for a long time now, and it's great that they managed to create a movie with all these characters! While I do not follow the comics, I do watch some of the superhero series, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is, in my opinion, very stylish and so well put together.The best part of the movie for me was, hands down, Harley Quinn. There is a great cast in this, and I wouldn't have imagined that Margot Robbie could pull off such a perfect Harley. Her persona, and her delivery certainly embodies the character, and she did such a tremendous job. Leto as Joker as well, was magnificent. It must be something about the crazy factor that makes it so captivating. Other cast embodied their characters well too, though none stood out like Harley Quinn did for me. The other great thing about this film is how stylish it is. Visuals and editing are on point, and most importantly- the soundtrack adds so much personality to the film. Just by watching the trailer, you get a sense of the kind of cheekiness that is embedded into the atmosphere. Which I think is mostly due to the fact that the Joker and Harley are unpredictable. Anyway, there is great music that accompanies the movie and adds to its style.I've seen mixed reviews for the film, and admittedly, the story itself isn't very good. The hook for this movie though, is the all star cast portraying various big shot comic characters. I loved it, simply because it's a fun film with a bit of darkness, but in essence encompasses the DC world. I liked how other superheroes (Batman, and the Flash) would casually make appearances, and there would already be that sense of history present, like it is in the comics. So overall, not a great story, but a fantastic squad and a well made film.",Suicide Squad
261,srdjan_veljkovic,It lacks substance/spirit,4,8 August 2016,"Let's start with the good: it looks OK, has good music, beautiful women wearing very little, at times some shirtless hunky men, a lot of mostly decent action, a few good jokes... There are much worse movies.But...About 2/3 of the movie is pretty formulaic ""Dirty Dozen"" clone, but with much less spirit. There are a few good jokes, but just a few. Otherwise, it's pretty boring and/or not interesting.Then it finally starts going somewhere, but quickly turns into a bunch of formulas, ""a bad man being good for his daughter"", ""good man sacrificing his love for the higher good"", etc.That is the movie's biggest flaw - it just doesn't have any life in it. Music is great, but, doesn't work well with the movie. Women are beautiful, but somehow not appealing. Guys are tough, yet have no charisma. Joker is different than most you've seen before, but, feels like a shot at doing the Joker ""Captain Jack Sparrow style"", which doesn't work. Since the plot is the usual comic-book nonsense, there's not much left, really.While Will Smith and Margot Robbie do their best to try to give some spirit to the movie, it feels forced and doesn't work. There is some chemistry between them, a ""big brother / little sister"" kind of thing, but, it's not explored. Since they are the actual main characters of the movie, for us to really get to know them, they needed much more screen time, preferably together. As is, the whole thing feels like another shot at making an ""Avengers"" clone, which fails. One hopes this trend will soon stop.",Suicide Squad

I can't even rationalize why I liked this movie. I understand that Suicide Squad is annoying at times. The scene where the girl cries like a little stupid b!t(# because she doesn't want Deadshot to shoot Batman was so irritating I actual wish she got shot in her ugly face. Croc was a stupid villain. The Witch was stupid. The ever infamous bar scene was one those scenes that will make some feel mortified even when you are watching this alone. The story, though easy to follow, was unfocused and retarded. So, yes, I can't explain why I liked this movie but I do.Well, this is what I liked about Suicide Squad. I actually like some the acting performances. The chick who played Harley Quinn, Joker, Deadshot were the ones who stood out while the others were descent enough at best. I liked the action and the effects. And well that's about it. I gave this movie a 7 and I know it doesn't deserve even half that amount but what can I tell you?

He ruined the most memorable and unique character that DC has in store by acting so damn artificial it made me wanna puke. He was very poor, that laugh was miserable and he did not succeed in pulling the characteristic Joker Face Changer for once. Anyway, his lines were also awful, but that is the director's problem and it shows us how a great movie potential can be wasted by making some very important wrong moves.",Suicide Squad
264,Darkjak007,Task Force X,5,26 July 2021,"Following the death of Superman the government begins to question the growing presence of Metahumans and the threat they might pose. Amanda Waller (viola Davis ) leader of A. R. G. U. S meets with officials to discuss a deterrent. Task force X a.k.a the suicide Squad an off the book Black ops squad made up of Super criminals to use as expendables operatives, against forces that threaten National Security. The overall idea of a suicide squad movie has a nice concept to it, having the focus being put towards the villains, as suppose to the heroes usually route for these movies. The fun and mischief you can get into with cast characters Whose morals more selfish. The problem is that most of the characters are the problem. They're either not focused enough, bland or misplaced. You have a movie with nine villains in it and only three of them are giving any focus or depth. Deadshot (Will Smith) is great he the only one driven by something other then himself with the situation with his daughter. Harley Quinn( Margot Robbie) is the highlight of the film, her attitude and personality add so much charm and color that the film that lack Severely in the second half Bringing the humor to the table along with Captain boomerang. You're giving looks inside her head of her connection with joker some of the decision she's made. Her and deadshot have the most development. Viola as Waller is good she's cold and callous and somewhat scary that you wish she was more present in the movie. She there on that like that you love her but also hate her. Everyone else in the movies just there. Rick flag(Joel Kinnaman) is suppose to be the field leader, but he's boring and bland just a generic soldier. Katana you have no idea what her story is who she is. Killer croc is wasted a very tragic Batman villain you don't do anything with, and just have saying things like ""yeah"", ""I like her"", ""BET"". Another problem is the overall mission of the film is that in the comic usually the squad's retrieving intel,people or dealing with dictators or terrorists and on occasion deals with superheroes if they interfere. They're put up against the enchantress as the threat. It's made pretty clear that the purpose of the squad here is to be used against threats such as meta-humans, and other beings. However when you look at the team this is not a roster of villains that are capable of dealing with a threat like this. The enchantress is a villain meant for someone like Zatanna or Constantine. Which leaves you wondering even though the league isn't founded at this point where's Batman and Wonder Woman. The only one who poses any sort of threat in power level is Diablo who doesn't want to anything for the majority of the film. This movie being on the chopping block with constant edits and reshoots, when you look at original advertisement for the movie it's made blatantly obvious that the joker was meant to be more of a obstacle of this movie. It why most people don't know what to make of Jared Leto because most of his stuff is cut from this movie and he's barely relevant. The music is a mixed bag primarily just made up of licensed songs, throughout the movie occasions and places where it doesn't really fit. This is where it starts to feel like they were trying to mimic Guardians with a story about a group of outcast and ruffians set to a retro soundtrack although instead of 70s music you're given late 80-90s musics. The film's a disappointment if they had a better plot and focus more on the villains playing and interact off each other(The Bar scene) then the movie could've had something.",Suicide Squad

But it's the clever-appearing plot that gripped us all, and left us in disappointment when we realised the pacing was terrible and pretty much the entire idea is lame. You're all better protecting your money from Suicide Squad. Or are you a seriously big fan of the DC comics and films? Well, there's no doubt that majority of DC's biggest fans left in regret.The best and only good element of this movie are certainly the characters, ideas and fantasy action sequences. But the fantastical action is saved for the climax and before then, it's just the Suicide Squad slowly attempting to get to the point.And despite the average design and gripping visuals, the writing and direction of this film are both utterly terrible. Honestly, there were some pretty creative moments in there, including the humour and movement. However, it's all completely predictable and nobody was expecting Suicide Squad to be a messy, pointless adventure.

The cast do their best to flesh out the characters, and Ayer seems to enjoy finding songs for the film's soundtrack, but the action scenes were not so remarkable. The biggest problem with the movie is that, despite all the villains, the main antagonist — wisely hidden in the advertising — was not so appealing and ridiculous. Fans will probably appreciate ""Suicide Squad"" for trying something different — and it gets bonus points for diversity — but the weaker characters and generally weak plot keep it from being one of the better comic book movies.

Everything about this is just awful and too cheesy to be funny or enjoyable. one thing i didn't get from the beginning was how they were going to justify, in a group of a guy that never misses a gunshot, a guy that controls fire, a guy that can decapitate ppl with boomerangs from distance and a guy that is literally a monster, how an ex psychologist girl who is completely crazy and has a baseball bat would be in the same group needed by the government, the answer? she has a nice bum and it's displayed a lot.

273,TheCorniestLemur,It's just as bad as I remember,2,16 June 2021,"From one awful franchise to another, I guess...And you know I didn't like Man Of Steel or Batman V Superman, but with every film in this series so far, we've been going down one star. And that's never a good sign.I'll just get this out of the way right now: the one and only thing that is consistently good about this crap is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and even that is ruined by the godawful lines she has to say. She does sell them better than a lot of other actors would though, and hopefully Birds Of Prey or THE Suicide Squad (really?) do her character better, because she absolutely could live up to any animated version of the character if she just had better material to work with.And I suppose there were...maybe two somewhat interesting shots? And then there's everything else. Still to this day, I don't think I can name a single other performance more try-hard and embarrassing (and pointless to the overall plot) than Jared ""I'm an idea"" Leto as the Joker, or more bland and a clear case of the actor playing themselves than Will Smith as Deadshot, or more useless and annoying than Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang. Not in a comic book film at any rate.And anyone else's character was too one-note to even be worth mentioning, so I won't. Just take my word for it that the characters in this film are terrible, and you don't believe their supposed friendship for a second.It's abundantly clear that DC, having no plan whatsoever for this universe and just wanting to rush it to their version of The Avengers, wanted this to be their version of Guardians Of The Galaxy, and thought that they could chuck a load of useless characters no one's ever heard of into this film because almost no one had ever heard of the Guardians before that film came out, but the power of branding gave it some huge appeal. But it worked in that film because it was an introduction to those characters, whereas this rubbish expects you to already know these characters, and if you don't, screw you, here's a load of exposition awkwardly crammed into the beginning, and have some old songs because people like them now.And on that note, I would like to offer up a big screw you right back at this film for choosing a song from not one, but TWO of my favourite bands, with Paranoid by Black Sabbath rammed into a scene of the squad being taken from their cells, and Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen put into the very ending scene because...nostalgia bucks, boiiiiiiiiiiii.And we also have The White Stripes, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Eminem, all just randomly thrown into scenes where they don't fit because they bought the rights first and read the script second, probably.The editing in general reeks of someone thinking that different = quirky and therefore good, although I'd at least take that over the obnoxious cinematography and colour correction that makes the film look like it was put through a filter of mushy peas.I already mentioned that the dialogue sucks, but easily the biggest issue with the script is that it doesn't compliment these characters at all. If the world is about to end, why is our best hope a mental patient, a guy with a boomerang, and some soldiers? The only member of the team who might actually be useful is El Diablo, and he spends half the film sitting on his behind being a pacifist. What the hell are Batman, The Flash, and Wonder Woman doing for this whole film?It should have been a smaller-scale black ops kind of thing, which not only would have made it more faithful to the comics, but in this world where everything has to have stakes for the entire world, if not the universe in comic book films, it actually would have made it more unique and interesting too.In case you haven't realised yet, I have a lot to say about this, maybe because I have a history with it. At the tender age of 15, and having just started getting into films, this was one of the first films I can remember actually hating, and for reasons I could explain. So maybe this was just for 15 year old me, but he's said his piece, and he won't bother you anymore.Seriously though, screw you for using Queen and Black Sabbath.",Suicide Squad
274,austin0731,a fun time at certain times,5,27 August 2016,"I would say that this is definitely a step up from BvS but it would seem that DC just can't get it right ever since the legendary Dark KNight trilogy. BvS had clear issues of trying to fit in way too much story while Suicide squad had really messy editing topped off with a clichéd and poor third act. The best part about the film was by far its characters, because really that's all that Suicide Squad has got. The entire first act consists of a couple of scenes where Amanda Waller talks us through the backstories of each of the characters which seems pretty ridiculous to me and a pretty odd choice. While the last act basically has the clichéd faceless army battle where the main characters fend off hordes of 'faceless people' just as we have seen time and time again.Harley Quinn and Deadshot were pretty good , Deadshot as the leader of the team was given an emotional backstory to make him seem like more of a redeemable character. Harley Quinn as, well Harley Quinn should be it was like she stepped right out of the comics and the Arkham games.Other members of the squad including captain boomerang was quite funny as a sort of comedic relief but that is basically it. El Diablo's backstory was quite intriguing too, as this man who has so much pain and fear of his own powers makes him also quite relatable and sort of down to earth despite being one of the only metahumans on the team. I do feel that Katana id quite underutilized as she has so much more potential instead of just being the crazy woman who talks to her sword.My biggest problem was with Enchantress, now from the trailer I would've said that Enchantress was the best part. Her transformation between June Moone and the Enchantress couldn't be handled better, it was really cool. However her powers and her as a villain was handled very poorly. For example her summoning this brother person and summoning the faceless legions and all, seems quite pointless and all. There wasn't really a purpose in which this villain is pursuing which makes her pretty meaningless. It is also quite ridiculous how everyone is fighting all around her while she spends more than half of the film wiggling around doing some sort of yoga thing. This whole Enchantress thing and the fact that we never understand the significance of this city that is being destroyed makes the entire film seem pretty pointless. If you think about it what is the point, Enchantress doesn't seem to care really and neither does the Suicide Squad so what is the point really? Another controversy is Jared Leto's Joker, this whole mobster look is quite a creative take on the classic joker, a spin on the great performance that Heath Ledger has gave us but we really didn't get enough of him to make much of a judgment as to how he really did, but I would say that as far as what we got to see he seems pretty good. Overall I think that there are redeeming factors but the storyline is extremely jumpy and messy and the story is quite meaningless and poorly crafted..",Suicide Squad
275,FallenEye,"Its Like, Committing Suicide by Making Love. Blame Warner Bros., not DC.",6,6 August 2016,"Finally got to watch the much anticipated Suicide Squad, and... I'd like to start with; DC and David Ayer, are not the reasons I believe, as to why this movie is WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION, one of the most incoherent motion pictures I have EVER seen in my life. Suicide Squad is incredibly enjoyable, however, it has more plot holes than a Gang/Mob of Meerkats, and that run deeper than The Mariana Trench.The Suicide Squad we've seen, is actually 2 versions of the same movie, in 1. And therein, lies the problem. Thus, TRUTHFULLY, anyone who believes this movie is an 8+/10, is either lying to themselves, or, they just don't care either way.Firstly, the good. The show was not stolen by who I thought it would be stolen by, which is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn - she was awesome to watch, and had a depth which once explored in later films, will probably make her the most interesting of the bunch, however in this film, truth be told, Viola Davis, Will Smith and Cara Delevingne's Enchantress, were the hero's that inflated the enjoyment. Davis's badassery was, ""gangster"". Will Smith's humour was, genuine. And Cara's Enchantress, was... well, enchanting.The Joker, I was afraid would be overacted by Leto, but... I think, he was as good as Affleck's Batman in comparison to Bales, as his Joker is comparable to that of Ledgers. Leto was good, but Ledger is still better.Speaking of Affleck, his Batman/Wayne cameo was, really fun to see.The visuals, though the cinematography could've been better, were an absolute joy.The score. One word. Amazing!!!Now for why critics give Suicide Squad 26%. This movie is like a well constructed main national road, that has ""potholes"" left, right and centre. The plot holes are so bad in fact, that the movie would keep contradicting itself in the exact same moment... I don't think I've ever seen a movie, at least one of this calibre, do that. For example; While Amanda Waller was describing just how crazier than The Joker, Harley is, The Joker proves to in fact, be crazier than Harley. Another one (among MANY others, that you just can't let it go anymore); Right after we're shown how easy it is to kill The Enchantress's army, Amanda, explains how difficult, to almost impossible it is, to kill them. Now, these can be taken as ""nit picking"", but sadly - because of the many times this same mistake happens, it's really not nit picking... But let's say it is; how about the movies motivation though? It's a plot hole so bad, it makes little, to no sense.The Squad, had an opportunity to kill the ONLY 2 people who had power over them, however, the movie just completely ignored that fact... A fact that would've ended this movie, in 1 hour. But fine, let's still say, they inexplicably, had a change of heart.How do they explain, The Enchantress not killing Amanda Waller in her hotel room??? I'll tell you how, they don't.How do they explain The Enchantress not killing everybody, in the boardroom at ARGUS? They don't.Why didn't AT ANY TIME, with one fell swoop, The Enchantress not take her heart back???The Enchantress's brother (Incubus) was a killing machine... Then suddenly, against the Squad, he turned into an amateur blind archer... He's precision moved from 100, to 0... Why? Because...Suicide Squad, made the exact same mistake Green Lantern made back in 2011 (AMONG MANY OTHERS); They had a villain way to powerful, as an initial adversary, to overcome.This films greatest flaw is, if you were to explain it's motivation logically... The movie wouldn't exist.Is 26% harsh? Perhaps. Is it better than BvsS... Arguably not, but I do believe it is certainly, without question, more enjoyable.I don't know how to rate this movie, because Making Love is 100% fun, however Suicide... that, that can mess up your whole day.Easily could've been an 8... Hell, even a 9... But then... That 9, from some point in the movie, slowly started rotating. I would truly love to give this movie a 7... I would love to... But, David Ayer/WB make it IMPOSSIBLE to justify. Hell, I'm only even hovering around 6, because I refuse to believe that, this movie could possibly be a 5, and below.So, from 9... To 6.something/10.",Suicide Squad
276,ghost_dog86,Stop using comic books to defend this movie!,3,7 August 2016,"This wanted to be ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" so bad!As the most teased and advertised movie of the year, even with a tsunami of negative early reviews, the ""Suicide Squad"" hype train was not to be derailed; which meant: No matter what the reviews said, I was still going to see this movie. That said, does this film live up to the hype? Synopsis: Telling the story of a group of incarcerated supervillains who are rounded up (for reasons unknown) by the government (instead for recruiting actual soldiers; again, ""for reasons unknown"") and made to battle a villainous witch (who wasn't even a threat until after said villains were ""rounded up""). Now if that sounds like a movie you want to see, then read on and let's see if I can't break your spirit. Director David Ayer's style (Training Day, End of Watch) is completely lost in a movie that looks like it was edited by producers into a mishmash of nonsensical cuts, flashbacks and one on-the-nose song after another. This outcome results in a lackluster plot jumble in conjunction with nonsensical character motivations, in equal amounts. I get why a supervillain would be forced to help the government, but (spoiler alert) there comes a point when they don't have to, BUT DO IT ANYWAY! (insert head-scratching emoji here). While Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) do work as entertaining leads, the Joker (played by Jared Leto in an absolutely forgettable performance) is made to look like a Juggalo electronic-dance DJ inspired pimp, whose motivations include wearing purple fur coats and running around the city with no shirt on, showing off his abs. The Joker I KNOW was all about chaos. That's what makes him scary; the fact that he isn't much for ""feelings"" and doesn't wear a frightening amount of bling-bling. But I guess it's 2016 and this is what we get; a Joker feat. Skrillex. As for all of the other B-side villains, they are complete throwaways. Final Thought: As much as I enjoyed ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (I know I'm in the minority here) ""Suicide Squad"" may be looked back upon as the beginning of the end for this particular cinematic DC universe. So, let me be the first to say it: RIP, DC.",Suicide Squad
277,galahad58-1,Harley Worth Watching,7,6 August 2016,Suicide Squad is not as bad as the reviews would lead you to believe. I had zero expectations for this movie and I was pleasantly entertained.Why was I entertained? Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Robbie was absolutely fabulous as Harley Quinn. I had reservations about her since I could not see her as Quinn; yet she was perfect. She channeled the essence of Harley Quinn beautifully. Now I am not a Will Smith fan at all. I have not been a fan of his recent movies. In this film he is very likable and charismatic and both he and Robbie steal the show.The script is below average and the action is so-so. The big baddie is laughable and most of the movie looks like it was poorly planned out. If it were not for Robbie and Smith I would not have liked this film at all. Add to it: Jared Leto is awful as The Joker - just plain awful. He is as annoying as Lex Luther was in Batman VS Superman and you just want his character to disappear. The other performance that was beyond bad was Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag. Kinnaman is worse than he was in Robocop - and that was pretty bad. I feel that different actors would have been better as the Joker and Flag - though The Joker really did not need to be in this film and his parts took away from the whole project.Recommended only for the Robbie and Smith characters.,Suicide Squad
278,dpolwatte,Suicide squad : Hit and miss,5,8 December 2018,"Suicide squad (2016) was the third installment for the DC extended cinematic universe connecting with Batman V Superman : Dawn of Justice (2016), would have been an amazing cinematic experience seeing it's cast, budget and crew but sadly it's a hit and miss. And also story wise.The story is flat and unemotional. The DC extended universe did the same mistake with Man of steel (2013).There is soo much explosions and gun fights but no real experience. Only thing that keeps the film running is Will Smith's Deadshot performance.And after Heath Ledgers master of a performance as Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), Jared Leto was expected to with a higher benchmark.Since he is extremely talented and the teasers showed a different joker, expectations of the fans were extrelmely high.Sadly we have 10 minutes of an idiot of a performance, he is more of a gangster than a mastermind criminal sociopath we see in the Joker character arc in the comics, cartoons and past films.Harley Quinn by Margot Robbie was highly anticipated but also less performed. She's too funny and less action.David Ayer is a good director. Harsh times (2005), Street Kings (2008) and End of Watch (2012) are really good films.Sabotage(2014) and Fury(2014) are made in the Suicide squad formula reflecting on a set of different character arcs working together to a common goal, which makes the viewers expectation for Suicide Squad extremely high.But sadly like ""Sabotage(2014)"" this fails spectacularly.The connectivity to the DC Extended universe is the other only thing that kept the film alive.Overall - 2.5/5",Suicide Squad
279,asifahsankhan,"For a SQUAD of an impressive-high-profile cast, not the best SUICIDE movie.",7,15 December 2016,"Initially stylish but ultimately ridiculous and chaotic, the DC comics-based adventure ""Suicide Squad"" also features some dubious moral values. Add to that the film's lurid atmosphere overall and its appeal, along with its appropriate audience, dwindles still further.And then, straight out of left field, there's Katana (Karen Fukuhara), a lady samurai whose deceased husband's soul is trapped in her sword. For no very clear reason, she winds up tagging along on the quest to quell the Enchantress' sibling as well.Writer-director David Ayer's film is barely passable while the action is chugging along. But scenes attempting to give moral shading to the characters -- and bonding them as a pseudo-family -- misfire completely. Viewers are supposed to be impressed by the fact that career hit-man Deadshot loves his young daughter, Zoe (Shailyn Pierre-Dixon), for instance. More persuasively, Diablo expresses his penitence for having misused the fire that shoots from his hands at will by refusing to employ this supernatural gift -- at least, that is, until the script really needs him to for the sake of an explosive finale.If there's any good news to be salvaged from this mess, it's that casting Viola Davis as a tough-as-nails government bureaucrat works quite well. Davis plays hard-bitten intelligence agent Amanda Waller. Waller's pet project is the creation of the combat team of the title, an ensemble of violent villains she's determined to spring from prison and put at the service of the government. Oh, did I forgot to mention, Margot Robbie? Come on, even the Joker fell for her surprisingly honest and accurate performance in this piece. Overall, enjoyable indeed. But nevertheless, for a SQUAD of an impressive- high-profile cast, not the best SUICIDE movie.",Suicide Squad
280,brunovanael,Almost fell asleep,3,6 February 2021,"So many stars, action scenes, villains, bad ass guys and tough talk. Yet I almost fell asleep several times. A messy collection of events leading to anything but suspense or interest",Suicide Squad
281,ivanmessimilos,A (new) DC disappointment,6,31 August 2016,"I was curious about this film, as a DC fan. The film belongs to the DC world and is a continuation of the last movie - Batman V Superman. That's why I did have the feeling to watch a series, not a movie. Too many characters tucked in barely two hours of film, however, can not be given to everyone as individuals. Most space (or time) are expected to get Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot, others are gathered crumbs and are presented in retrospectives. Joker I can not like, definitely the worst Joker in history. Too much they tried to squeeze in a film so that a slurry is full of ingredients, but the mixture was not good. The film is incomplete, with a bad story, at times too much CGI effects. If you disallow the brain, maybe you like it or you at least have a little fun. The disappointment for me.",Suicide Squad
282,mistoppi,"Small good things, but as whole bad",4,20 August 2016,"I saw this trailer when I went to see X-Men: Apocalypse and then again when I went to see Ghostbusters. The trailer made me very optimistic. Before the trailer I thought that this was not worth seeing. I know, I should've learnt by now that trailers are always better than the actual movie: the movie itself shattered all my hopes towards this movie. Writing in this movie is partially good. The idea of the script is good: let's give the bad guys a chance. Characters are deep, and it's easy to start liking them. They all have backstories, and some are explored. They give the characters something more than ""LOL we are just bad and crazy"". The only thing is I hate the Joker, but all the other characters were extremely interesting. But the writing is partially horrible. The dialogue seems kinda off. You see what's meant to be funny but it doesn't necessarily make you laugh. And it seems like this movie is trying to smooch off of Deadpool's success, considering he's an antihero, and he had that hilarious yet dark movie. If Suicide Squad wasn't trying to be like Deadpool meets Avengers except in DC universe, then their timing wasn't exactly the greatest.But I don't want to start saying which one is better DC or Marvel. Both are good yet both suck. I'm just saying, the timing was bad.When I watch a movie like this, I have high hopes for the action scenes, especially when technology is getting better and all that. In Suicide Squad, the action scenes are poorly executed. They are messy and it's hard to see what is going on and who is who. I mistook Boomerang for Rick Flag at one point and the dialogue was very confusing. Action scenes are allowed to be messy if they look interesting. These scenes were just shooting, and that's not exactly interesting to watch.I loved most of the actors chosen for this movie. I love Will Smith, I love Margot Robbie, Karen Fukuhara, Jay Hernandez and Viola Davis (and of course Affleck, even if his role is small in Suicide Squad). Now I don't exactly like Cara Delevingne's acting skills, but still there's something much worse in the cast: Jared Leto. I've seen him in two movies before this, so I haven't seen that much acting from him but he is definitely not the right choice for Joker. He's just a disastrously bad copy of Heath Ledger. But the cast is amazingly diverse. Visually this movie is amazing. It's very dark, like David Fincher's movies. That's effective, though sometimes you don't even see who is in the scene. The bright neon colours give a nice touch to the movie.The best part of Suicide Squad is the soundtrack. Few of my favourites include Heathens by Twenty One Pilots, Fortunate Son by CCR, Bohemian Rhapsody, Spirit in the Sky, Seven Nation Army. I can't stand Eminem, but Without Me by him suited this film very well. All are amazing, but still, Bohemian Rhapsody was used better in the trailer - it's really hard to put in an actual scene, no matter how awesome that song is.Suicide Squad has many amazing details, but as a whole it isn't great. The idea is good, but eventually the story is boring. It seems like the film is just destroying stuff, explosions and shooting and smooching off of amazing characters. The characters deserve better movies. I heard there might be a spin-off for Harley Quinn, that's amazing. But I want to see the others in their own movies as well, like Katana and Deadshot.",Suicide Squad
283,FelipeCarrillo,"""Suicide Squad"" Is As Good As The Actions Of Its Antiheros",7,6 August 2016,"""The world changed when Superman flew across the sky... and then it changed again when he didn't"" says Waller at the beginning of the film. Based on the villains from DC comics created by John Ostrander and Len Wein in the early 80's; ""Suicide Squad"" (the most anticipated film of 2016) erects its story after the events witnessed in ""Batman v Superman"" (another of the most awaited of the year). Without the protection of Superman, USA is defenseless with respect to national security, therefore, Amanda Blake Waller ( Viola Davis) - high- ranking American government official and associated of the agency ARGUS - rethinks her project of national protection reforming ones few changes with the purpose of be accepted. Her project is entitled ""Suicide Squad"" and it constitute by highly dangerous criminals imprisoned in a high security prison. It is here where we know to Deadshot (Smith), Harley Quinn (Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Courtney), Killer Croc (Akinnuoye-Agbaje), El Diablo (Hernandez), Sliptknot (Beach). ""You want to put our national security in the hands of witches, gang-bangers and crocodiles?"" asks an official public directly to Waller. This, the only alternative of global salvation for attacking to Enchantress (Delevingne), a powerful witch of black magic that wishes to exterminate the human race with its granitic brother, Incubus.The anomalous dissemination of the film has solidified the expectations of the whole world, the boys most evil and deranged of the planet as heroes, Suggestive? Of course, but as if it were another Hollywood product, so wonder is not relatively true. I am of those who do not see trailers, TV Spots, interviews or ads with products of such great magnitude like this one, so I attended to the movie theater with the naivete of a child small, without consent of its argument but predisposed to amaze me. However, I was also predisposed to bring me a bad taste due to critics reviews published yesterday that I accidentally saw, and the result was a mixture of both presentiments. ""Suicide Squad"" possessed potential and knew take advantage it during certain scenes with certain characters, nevertheless, an unintelligible script, untapped characters and an directing not appropriate for this kind of movies makes it a small step for the DCEU and not the leap to fame of a company that strives to predominate. They had the opportunity on their hands, but some villains snatched them shamelessly.The comic fans/ cinephiles will receive pleasant delights from its screenwriter and director David Ayer, in addition to some cameos (""The Flash"" & ""Batman"" portray to police officers imprisoning to villains, something not very useful for a generic development, except for the arrest of Quinn), the soul and costumes of the characters are chimeric and hilarious. Its soundtrack fits with delicateness and rebellion to the harmony of each scene; Eminem, Rhapsody and Skrillex offer a dark auditive landscape. Ayer also delights to the eye with comic fidelity, nevertheless, the double- edged of this strategy made less than more, basing on several comics, they omit some important information (about the Joker) complicating the creation of a rational and harmonious argument for the film. By the same token, the comical aspect was at the hands of the Harley Q - steals the scenes -, a black humor with Deadshot and crazy humor by the Joker. David Ayer feared to repeat the mistake of Znyder (""BvS"") with ""SQ"", so, he decided to make the so known ""re- shoots"" for fill it of color and visual saturation, however, nor darkness nor the fluorescence has been of the pleasure of critics.Disappointing was to see that Leto's much-vaunted Joker did not form part of the squad and also with all the advertising boom and anticipations did not reach the connection I expected, Yes, he is a worthy successor to Ledger but his scant projected story and his not so majestic appearances placed him in a third plane. More striking and shocking I find to Smith, who, as his character, never wasted a bullet and with Deadshot just dead on target, again. ""SQ"" also lacks of a villain worthy of presence, Delevingne does not convince and was a bad play establish her as the antagonist main, weak point of the script. Robbie is undoubtedly the protagonist of the film, her introduction, her dialogues, her hobbies and her psychotic and brazen way of being ridicule others male villains, Margot steals the credit and we look forward to her solo film with greed.""Suicide Squad"" is Harley Quinn, the Joker, Deadshot, specific scenes of the development and allegorical final scene. We need a sequel, with the same characters, but with a script more lucid and comprehensible, more progress around the other antiheros and a distinct focus, sorrowfully, our villains continue with the bad luck of DC and remain as an excellent summer blockbuster, 2016 has not turning back, but 2017 is coming (""WW"" & ""JL"").",Suicide Squad
284,Olicosmic,A complete letdown,4,19 June 2018,"After the immense amount of hype surrounding this film, I was excited. After seeing how great this movie looked in trailers, I was getting more pumped and pumped. But, after watching this, I hung my head low, I was so dissapointed. I wanted to love this movie so bad, but with all the things wrong with it, I just can't whatsoever. It is one of, if not the most disappointingly mediocre and somewhat boring comic book movie I've ever seen. The movie focuses way too hard on character development, and while that doesn't sound terrible, it shouldn't be the main focus of the entirety of the movie, because it mostly is. And because of this, this movie is mostly exposition and little to nothing else. It's still not as bad as it was in Fant4stic, but it is still grating nonetheless. The action scenes in this movie are never more than just passable. They're not bad, but they never have that tense feeling that many other action scenes from previous movies had. The only remotely thrilling moment is at the end of the movie, and the fact that it's this way is extremely disappointing that the filmmakers didn't add more of that to the rest of this movie. Also, the Joker is not as much in this movie as he should be. This sucks, because Jared Leto is an awesome Joker, but the fact that he's only in a few scenes just makes his character have a lot untapped potential. I hope to see more of him in the possible sequel. This movie, despite these incredibly dissapointing low points, isn't really awful, as it does have a few redeeming qualities. One is the soundtrack, as it is one of the absolute best I've heard in a comic book movie, right next to Guardians Of The Galaxy 1 and 2. Another are the performances. Everyone in this film did a fantastic job and they were very entertaining in each of their roles. Another are the visuals and presentation, as everything looks great and the special effects do add a lot to a few scenes. Despite these high points, they just aren't enough to save this movie, as it is nothing more than just a film filled with exposition and a few action sequences and nothing more. I'm sure hardcore fans of DC will enjoy this film, but I just couldn't that much, as there are so many better films out there. Overall, despite this movie not necessarily being terrible, it is still, in my opinion, a complete letdown.",Suicide Squad
285,Chalice_Of_Evil,"Suicide Squad, attack!!!",8,4 August 2016,"This movie's received a bad rap/lot of hate, which I personally feel is unwarranted. Funny how the things some people complain about regarding this movie are also present in other movies, yet those ones are regarded as 'popular'/'successful' (apparently they're willing to overlook 'flaws' in certain movies, but not others, which seems a bit hypocritical to me). The movie isn't the ""mess"" that some make out. It begins seeming more like a series of music videos, with different songs played as characters are introduced (with helpful character attributes displayed on screen), but establishing the characters/what they can do is necessary. Not sure why people had problems with these introductions.While I'd known of Harley Quinn from Batman: The Animated Series, I hadn't really seen what the big deal was, so I had few expectations. Fans were always going to have their own ideas/opinions of what she 'should' be like in her first big screen live-action interpretation and obviously pleasing EVERYONE would've been impossible, but Margot Robbie is without a doubt the movie's scene-stealer/MVP. Through flashbacks, we see glimpses of her as a psychiatrist, Dr. Harleen Quinzel, how she fell for the Joker, then wound up strapped to a gurney/being given harsh electroshock ""treatment/therapy"" by him as thanks for doing his bidding (which explains her mental instability/how she's as much a victim as a perpetrator) on her journey towards becoming his accomplice which reaches its conclusion with her *choosing* to fall (NOT being pushed) into a vat of chemicals.Those hung up on whether Robbie's Harley retained the character's traditional strong accent and red/black costume should be content with the former and appreciate at least the *acknowledgement* of the latter (which makes a cameo). I don't get the complaints about Harley's look/outfit in this movie. Were people really so eager to see her running around in a traditional harlequin costume the entire movie? Is it some fetish thing? Naturally, that was never going to work here and changes were to be expected when adapting animation to live-action (as for those complaints about the 'skimpiness' of her outfit/all the shots of Miss Robbie's behind...funny that nobody expresses the same outrage over all the gratuitous shirtless shots of male characters in superhero movies). Her character shouldn't be defined by how she looks/dresses, what *should* matter the most is her attitude/personality, and Robbie knocks it out of the park, maintaining the essence of the character.When she's not performing gymnastics in her cell or clobbering enemies with a baseball bat, we're treated to a brief glimpse of what's likely to be the closest we're ever going to get to the classic Joker/Harley/Batman dynamic (in one of Batfleck's cameos) with a scene featuring them in the Jokermobile together, where she uses her signature ""puddin'""/""Mr. J"" pet names and refers to Batman as ""batsy, batsy, batsy"". This is also the scene where Jared Leto's interpretation appears the most 'Joker-esque'. The rest of the time he just seems to be trying a bit too hard (what's with the purring?). The 'Extended Cut' of the film helps flesh out the twisted Joker/Harley 'relationship' and shows how truly unhealthy it is.Regarding the film's other characters; Will Smith-as-Deadshot is basically playing himself, though he gets some ""human"" moments with his daughter. His best dynamics are with Harley (you can see why he develops a soft spot for her along with the other team members...and who can blame them?) and Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag (the most 'normal' of the group). Speaking of, he has a relationship with Cara Delevingne's June Moone (who is taken over by an entity, the Enchantress, giving her a scary-as-hell makeover) that has been engineered by Amanda Waller who proves to indeed be 'the devil' (like Harley thinks she is), when she shows her true colours as a manipulative, cold-hearted b!tch (she's more of a witch than Delevingne's actual witch character) who's not to be trifled with.Characters that don't get as much focus include El Diablo (who's not only the most powerful member of the Squad, but also proves himself quite heroic. He's another who benefits from the 'Extended Cut', as it expands on his remorse for the bad things he's done/adds depth, especially in the bar scene which is actually a really good one for all the characters and it's a shame it was severely trimmed in the 'Theatrical Cut'), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney is entertaining in the role of the bogan with a pink unicorn fetish who will drink a beer mid-fight), Katana and Killer Croc (who provide 'the muscle').I'll admit the film's 'Big Bad' is fairly weak (as is her brother and minions), but when June first changes into the Enchantress, I actually thought she was effectively creepy (I felt sorry for June/Flag considering how they were used/manipulated/controlled by Waller, who I wished someone would've injected with a tiny explosive so she could learn what it felt like). It's only when she changes again (this time resembling the 'Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tubeman' from Family Guy with her dancing moves) that she loses that 'creepy' factor. As for Slipknot, he may as well have been called 'Dead Meat', given how predictably doomed he was.Things might seem slightly confusing on occasion, but it's actually a pretty basic premise. As we're constantly reminded, this motley crew are the BAD GUYS (at least they have an excuse for being a-holes, unlike certain so-called ""good guys""/""superheroes"" in other comic book movies), which keeps things from getting 'boring' more often than not. I personally thought the movie was good fun and I had no problems with the directing or soundtrack. Naturally, there are those who deem these interpretations of the characters as 'not right' because they don't match how they think the characters 'should' be, but if you're not the overly nitpicky sort, then this should be sufficiently entertaining. However, I'd definitely recommend checking out the 'Extended Cut' which adds quite a bit of nuance/depth to the characters, thus making the film feel more 'whole'/'complete'.",Suicide Squad
286,Gresh854,"It's Disappointing As Hell, And An Overall Huge Mess With Sprinkles of Entertainment",2,4 August 2016,"Man, I don't think that I've been more pumped for a film since Star Wars Episode VII. Most of the marketing for Suicide Squad has been extremely good and has kept me pumped since 2015. Now the big question is, is it any good? Well, overall it's enjoyable, but it does not exceed expectations in many ways. I really hoped that this film would make up for the disappointing and flawed film Batman V Superman, but all it confirmed for me was that the DCEU isn't trying hard enough, especially since this was even worse than Batman V Superman. Now before I get into the negatives about the film, I'm going to talk about the pros about this film. First or all let me get this out of the way, Jared Leto as the Joker was great. I enjoyed his performance; he wasn't trying to copy Heath Ledger or Nicholson he was his own unique gangster, mob Joker that really caught my interest. Now this does lead me into one con that I will talk about towards the end of this review.  Deadshot and Harley Quinn, my gosh were probably the best characters in the film. I loved seeing these two on screen they were portrayed perfectly especially Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Diablo, Captain Boomerang, and Rick Flag were also fine characters. Killer Croc, Katana, and Slipknot were on and off characters to me, sometimes they had okay moments and sometimes they just felt like unwanted and unnecessary characters. Amanda Waller I believe would've been a great character if she didn't make some certain choices in the film that honestly made no sense or were never explained. Now the action in the film was pretty fun for the most part. I liked the fighting I like the flashback character origin stories that all happen at the beginning of the film which are by far the most entertaining aspects of the film. I also liked how there was a lot of really funny humor in the film as well which was definitely a plus. The film's first act is pretty entertaining and for the most part I enjoyed it. Oh Yah, Batman killed it once again in the film like he did in BVS. Now that I've got most of the Pros out of the way it's time to get into the negatives of the film. This film's editing honestly was pretty bad. I know the film had to do last minute film shootings and editing and I think that might have made the film take a turn for the worst. The film is pretty fast paced which may seem like a good thing, but it really wasn't cause the editing was so choppy that there was no breathing time for me to process what was happening on screen. The editing sometimes really confused and took me out of this film. Also, the soundtrack is a great soundtrack, but most of the music interjected into the film was so loud and so out of place that it distracted me from many scenes, one in particular which I will not spoil which contains the Joker that really threw me off. Also another con is the main finale battle of the film was extremely terrible. It almost reminded me of the ending of the new Fantastic Four; it was obviously not as bad but it was extremely lazily made. Also there is so much scenes that felt like they were missing from the film which made the plot become extremely confusing and stupid at times and almost, in the end, made no sense at all which really told me that the people working on the plot of the film did a poor job. There's also some over-dubbing for the voices of the characters that you can tell were voice-overs which really took me out of the film one in particular with the Joker that almost made me laugh cause it was so badly dubbed. Also, no spoilers of course Enchantress and the villain of this film were done very poorly. Enchantress was a fine character at the beginning but slowly morphed into a cheesy, disposable character and the villain was so cliché and lame which really bugged me. Some of the line delivery in this film was sometimes extremely out of place and truly cringe-worthy even though the majority of the film does have decent dialogue. Its just that some of the poorly done dialogue probably had to due with the factor of the editing that made it seem poorly done. And a huge disappointing factor of the film is that the Joker is barely even in the film. He's literally interjected into 30 second mini scenes throughout the entire runtime of the film. My final flaw with this film is the emotional levels they try to present in this film. There is so many scenes in this movie that try to be emotional and try to touch your heart, when really it just comes out as either confusing or extremely messy. I do enjoy how they tried to bring heart into this film, but some of it was done very strangely, and not in a professional way for sure. Overall though I think if you go into this film with an open mind knowing that this film is going to be a okay, mindless blockbuster film, you might enjoy it. If you're going to go into it thinking its going to be the DC film that saves the DCEU and ""Oh this is going to be a awesome film,"" you will most likely hate this film. To me this film is overall a huge disappointment, but it still has a couple of enjoyable moments. Suicide Squad is a film with an extreme amount of editing problems and flaws, but it has just enough action and likable characters that it can be enjoyed as a choppy, okay, summer blockbuster popcorn-flick. Overall Grade: C IMDb Score: 5/10",Suicide Squad
287,fung0,Doesn't Deserve the Hate,8,16 July 2017,"I took a chance on Suicide Squad despite the non-stop barrage of hate from both fans and critics. And I was pleasantly surprised. No, this isn't a great film, but it is quite an enjoyable one. It lacks the self-importance and obsessive fan service of the more mainstream comics-based movies, which allows it to succeed as a simple bit of entertainment.The extended 'Dirty Dozen' setup works well, and the interplay between the seriously off-key characters pumps a bit of desperately needed fresh air into the superhero genre. The absence of major comic-book stars is a huge bonus, making the plot slightly less predictable.Don't view this as belonging to the ""DC Universe,"" or the ""Batman canon,"" or any other tired, anal-retentive fan framework. It's a simple, standalone movie, with cool characters and fast action. It's actually FUN, which is something you can't say about most comics-inspired films any more.",Suicide Squad
288,virindra,Not that spectacular.,6,6 August 2016,"After all those Marvel movies, DC opened with Suicide Squad. In a world without Superman, we need bad guys to protect us. Yes, Batman caught some of these bad guys, but still, we need them. I guess Batman was too busy, with what exactly? This movie Obvious has some major flaws. But if we don't look at all those flaws, we see what this movie really is made of; a mixture of good and bad actors and actresses and some cosmetic make-up of special effects which made this movie a bad Marvel look alike.The movie starts with retro introductions of the bad guys. That was a bit awkward. Margot Robbie was a terrific Harley. Will Smith had a great come-back. Very beautiful his bond with his daughter. I did not get this Australian guy with his boomerangs, like I did not get the guy of The Avengers with his bow and arrows.The thins about these movies is that these actors and actresses have to act like they are scum. IRL they are very rich and have a rich life. So while watching the movie, it just does not make any sense. I did not feel the hurt or grief of the characters.I like Jared as an actor. Has been watching his movies from the nineties. But the Joker is still Ledger. If you can't make a better sequel, just don't. The end of the movie, I just did not get it.The movie as an intro for a better movie is succeeded. This movie as itself is not worth watching a second time. First time is painful enough.",Suicide Squad
289,GomezAddams666,"Give the DCEU to David Ayer, this is how you make a DC movie!",8,7 August 2016,"SUICIDE SQUAD - NO SPOILERS REVIEWThis movie has been lambasted by the critics, they have called it misogynistic, crude, extremely violent... my take? The critics are worthless on this one.David Ayer has delivered a freaking Masterpiece when it comes to Comic Book Movies, he has taken irredeemable characters and turn them into something more, these guys are not seen as villains but as anti- heroes even. You get to care for the characters and their emotional struggles. More than that the performances are great. I was worried about Will Smith playing Will Smith but he delivers a great Deadshot, every character is on point, from Captain Boomerang to Killer Croc. And Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is the prefect villain, she embodies the evil side of government, she is someone that seen from any side you really want her dead and suffering, she is able to get that emotion from you, she is an amazing actress.And as for the Clown Prince of Crime? (mild SPOILER) He's really not that much in the movie, yet Jared Leto's take (as much as I questioned this version before) is amazing, he's no Heath Ledger or the Animated Joker but he fits nicely in the DCEU. Last but not least, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, and as much as I wanted to see her in the Harlequin outfit she makes you not care about her costume as she deliberately steals the show, she becomes the key ingredient in this movie.I do have to point out that the writing towards the end became a bit predictable (more than usual in a CBM), and it leaves some HUGE holes and questions unanswered, but they managed to redeem themselves with some twists that tho expected the movie would have been incomplete and pointless without.But all and all Suicide Squad is a mixture of violence, drama and loads of humor. THIS is where you start the DCEU, take notes Zack Snyder, THIS is how you do it, because so far it has been the BEST the DCEU has to offer.2016 has been a mixed year for CBM, with disappointments like Batman v Superman, X-Men: The Mocking... I mean, X-Men: Apocalypse, and Comic Book gems like Deadpool and Captain America: Civil War. And Suicide Squad? Belongs to the latter group, not to say it was a great cinematic achievement but it was respectful to the source material, and incredibly fun to watch.I rate it 8/10.",Suicide Squad
290,PetarNeo,Definitely not as bad as critics say or is it?,4,31 August 2016,"It's new and it brings a lot of heroes so you must make some compromises if you want something like that to work. Way Ayer did it was probably one of best ways and only problem was main villain and his lover. Movie had to be made at certain date so director scraped some things and put them together. Deadshot is may little too Smith but hey Harley ain't nothing more than Harley and Margot played very well with some over the top moments. Balance between seriousness of DC universe and some light put inside is always good thing to make audience entertained. Enchantress seems too powerful to be taken and tricked so easily but Harley is unpredictable. Flag looks very sentimental but at the same time so ""badass"" you got to wonder about that. Joker, what is there to be said except we saw a too little of him. Jared is exceptional actor that is capable of creating very strong characters and he did pretty good job but evidently Ayer didn't put too much of him cause t was going to cost probably little more. Light, fun, strong, violent, sad, powerful, book example villain and mixed characters but after all it shows us maybe there is hope some day we'll be so excited about new DC movie. 1.5/4",Suicide Squad
291,Spideyfan-963-246215,Suicide Squad Review,6,9 September 2016,"Suicide Squad(2016) Starring: Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Karen Fukuhara, Viola Davis, Jai Courtney, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Ike Barinholtz, Scott Eastwood, Cara Delevingne, Adam Beach, Ben Affleck, Jim Parrack, Common, Ezra Miller, Alex Meraz, David Harbour, Corina Calderon, Ray Olubowale, Amanda Brugel, Ariane Bellamar, Alyssa Veniece, Murray Urquhart, and Kevin Hanchard Written and Directed By: David Ayer Review WORST HEROES EVER You know it's not easy being both a fan and a critic. But any-who Suicide Squad based on the DC comics series is the first comic book super-villain movie which is one of the few reasons I was looking forward to this movie, the second was the director who I heard is pretty great and last but not least was the cast. The film takes place after the events of Batman V Superman, and they do a good job of showing how the world has come around Superman and they're really feeling his absence. Amanda Waller(Viola Davis) is talking to the government being like look we need to prepare we need to get ready in case we get another meta-human attack happens since Superman is out of the picture we're at a loss for heroes. Her contingency plan is to take all of these meta-human, villains that they have in prison and force them to work for her in case there's an event they can't handle. Before I keep going I liked it, it's not one of the greatest comic book movies of all time but it was very fun to watch. I can see what's wrong the first 40-50 minutes was terrible not awful but they did the cardinal sin of film a movie must show not tell the backstories. The Joker is apparently the godfather I didn't like that either, kiss the ring more like kiss my... you know what let's not get too aggressive. The pacing of the films also a part that brings the movie down. With that said however this movie is one with a lot of heart for it's source material it's got great performances, Margot Robbie and Will Smith being the standouts of the film, even Jai Courtney was good I mean oh my goodness Jai Courtney was good in something. They're even some cameos I won't spoil. My favorite little Easter egg is don't blink but you could see Harley's original costume from the cartoon series. Suicide Squad is well worth watching and the majority of fans will definitely have a good time. Unfortunately, it definitely disappoints in a lot of ways, and as a result, it isn't really the movie Task Force X deserved or the release which will put the DC Films Universe on the path many feel it should be taking. It's a mess of a film and I din't like Joker but this Squad gets a three out of five.",Suicide Squad
292,Lewis_Heather787,A good film with some problems! Deja vu with a DC film!!!,6,6 August 2016,"Going into this film I was hoping that it would be better than batman v superman, which i never thought I was ever going to say, and steady the Warner bros / DC ship. Did suicide squad steady the ship and be a better film than BVS, well yes and no. It seems i am repeating my thoughts towards both DC properties that have been released this year, good films with some/ a lot of problems. Now i believe that suicide squad has similar problems to BVS, which are story, structure and the third act. However there also some different and more worrying problems about this film. The first problem with the film is the villain, who is incredibly weak and not threatening in anyway. I really liked enchantress early on in the film when she was more of a witch, however when she turned into this ""arm waving"" queen thing it didn't work. This really bugged me especially once she started turning people into this weird and meaningless creatures just for the squad to kill. The other problems of the film are the structure and the third act which are both all over the place. It really shows that director David Ayer was reportedly only given 6 weeks to write the script, the ending is very predictable. However there is a lot of promising and good things in this film, which for me tips the scale to make this film good. The performance all across the board are fantastic, Will smith wasn't ""will smith"" he actually played a character that I cared for. Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn, she absolutely nails the spirit and the craziness of the character. Those two are a step above the rest, even Jai Courtney was likable in a film, hallelujah!!! Now lets get onto to the Joker, who I can't really comment on because I haven't seen enough to judge the performance. I think Jared Leto did an good job but I just need more, like appearing in a batman film, for me to appreciate and acknowledge the performance fully. Talking of batman, once again in the DCEU his is absolutely fantastic and Ben Affleck is brilliant, although his only in the film for about 5 minutes he is one of the best parts of the film. Another little side note is the Flash, which was surprising and makes me more excited to see him in Justice League and his standalone film. Finally suicide squad has a lot of problems with script , structure and the third act however the characters and the performances for me just about out weigh the negatives of the film. However I can see how the critics have torn this film to pieces and the reaction of people who really enjoyed it. DC have had 2 strikes this year lets just hope that Wonder woman next year can safe the day and its not 3 strikes and out.",Suicide Squad
293,Dragonsouls,A lot of people are going to connect with these characters!,8,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a story about redemption. The anti-hero formula is becoming a popular trend lately in literature and cinema, and even though it didn't work for Superman, it really works for these guys because they didn't start out good. The reason why you root for the Suicide Squad is because they feel guilt; and they really seem to want to atone for their sins.Will Smith absolutely stole this movie as Deadshot both for his dramatic scenes and action ones. I was surprisingly brought to tears on several occasions because of his performance and story arc. Even is action scenes were the best. One of the disappointments I had while watching this film was in the action department because there weren't any jaw dropping scenes like you got in Civil War or even BVS for that matter. However, Deadshot kicked ass! My next favorite thing;--Margot Robbie. Oh baby, she was a maniac in this movie, and I was surprised at the passion she brought to this role. There were many instances however, when she was used for comic relief and it I found that it really offset the otherwise serious tone of this film. Her best scenes were when she got serious and rallied the crew. Loved her, absolutely looked, sounded and acted like the Harley Quinn from the cartoons. Brooklyn accent was SPOT ON!The 3rd standout was Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. I found myself rooting for this guy, despite his degree of villainy and his dark past. There's a lesson to be learned from him in that we can all grow from past mistakes. Each of the members of Task Force X AKA Suicide Squad will leave you rooting them for one reason or another, as we are given glimpses of their dark pasts in many flashback scenes throughout the film. But all in all, great chemistry between the characters, especially between Deadshot and Rick Flag.Enchantress, the villain in this film, without giving away too much, is kind of a representation of each character's own inner torment, one they have to overcome in order to redeem themselves and grow as people. I know a lot of people have been complaining about the main villain in this movie, and many would've preferred the main villain to be Joker, but I didn't mind. I thought the villain and villains added a spiritual aspect to the plot. In a sense, the main villain represented each member of the Suicide Squad's dark past.Now, the cameos. DC fans...be ready! I know you're expecting Batman, and his scenes were pretty bad-ass. But be ready for more Justice League members to kick some ass. That's all I'll say! And if anyone thinks Jared Leto is rehashing Heath Ledger, be ready to be proved wrong. Leto really made this Joker his own. He was hip, sexual, burnt out, and just sick! And I do admit with a shame face, that I was rooting for him in the end.If I had to nitpick though, it would be in the editing department. This film is another example of a director's art being mutilated by the studio for the sake of greed. There were some really choppy editing issues in the middle of the film, and I heard that a lot of film was cut. I am starting to think that studios force directors to cut their films so that a director's cut may be released, increasing the amount of rentals, Blu-ray and digital purchases. A lot of people, including myself, felt that the Joker felt out of place in this film. He had nothing to do with the plot at all, but yet, he was so brilliantly played by Jared Leto, that many longed for more of his screen time nonetheless.I hope a director's cut will be released. Perhaps the Joker might matter a bit more because of it. All props to David Ayer though, for creating an eerie atmosphere in this film, that was clearly inspired by the Arkham Video games. The entire 2nd half of the film took place during the course of one night, in parts of the city were evacuated so that the Suicide Squad could deal with the threat in secret. It really felt like I was watching a live-action Arkham City video game. DC fans will eat this movie up. And judging by the cheers at my theater, non-comic fans will too. 9/10. Not a classic piece of film making by far, but a gem of a comic book film!",Suicide Squad
294,Avwillfan89,S.S - Skewered and scrambled,4,11 August 2016,"After much anticipation, and after a long wait, it pains me to say that this movie is disappointing to say the least.From start to finish - the script is an absolute mess. Too many characters are introduced and subsequently under-used, and the soundtrack, which was actually the best part, was scattered all over the place, placing one greatest hit after the other in a very short space of time. Harley Quinn and Deadshot seemed to be the protagonists of the film (Smith and Robbie doing a great job of it) but even they didn't have enough character development. The Joker was hardly in it at all - and Harley Quinn's backstory was simply glossed over, when it could have been a hell of a lot more interesting. And half the scenes in the trailers don't even make it into the movie. A real shame.",Suicide Squad
295,kenzibit,Enjoyed this a lot.,6,22 March 2020,"Back stories were great, great stunts with good performances from these guys. The effects were great in some areas but too noticeable in others. Hope a sequel comes out soon.",Suicide Squad
296,Jared_Andrews,What a Waste,3,7 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a total freaking mess. A colorful, yet bleak scattershot of stuff sprayed on a big screen. The movie is like one of those paintings where someone randomly splattered different colors all over a large canvas then called it art.The movie's greatest disappoint is easily The Joker. Granted that following Heath Ledger's iconic performance was going to be impossible for anyone, Jared Leto's character still fell short of even one's more reasonable expectations.Leto made some weird choices. Not weird in a good way, just weird. For one, his Joker played as oddly seductive. I suppose the movie had to give us some reason to believe he landed Harley Quinn, but this part of his persona still felt strange. Plus he wore diamond-studded earrings and flashed some bizarre metallic teeth. He looked half like The Joker and half like some unstable rap mogul.The worst part about The Joker in this movie, and the movie itself, is that he wasn't really necessary. With a small change he could have been removed from the story entirely. The writers just forced him in, probably to appease fans.Similarly, Leto's performance felt forced. His voice, his breathing, his expressions, they didn't seem totally convincing. Perhaps Leto tried too hard to distinguish himself from Ledger's adaptation. Whatever the case, this Joker let me down.Incidentally his love interest, Harley Quinn, highlighted the movie. She delivered an impressive performance and an even more impressive sex appeal. That alone kept the movie watchable at times. It's not really what I look for in a bad-ass superhero/super-villain movie, but if you're going to throw Margot Robbie's ass in my face 15 times in two hours, I'm going to watch.That's all for praise, back to the flaws.The soundtrack annoyed me greatly. To open the movie, each character is introduced, accompanied by a song that I like by itself but hate in the context of the scene since it doesn't fit. The filmmakers want us to empathize with the characters they introduce. We do not, save for Will Smith's Deadshot because he has a charming daughter to look after. Deadshot turns out to be one of the film's top two most intriguing characters (along with Quinn), thanks to Smith's fine acting. Seeing Will Smith in movies again makes me happy. I missed him. Just throwing that out there.After meeting the other baddies, we learn about Enchantress, an ancient spirit witch who has lived for over 6,000 years. She is a part of the suicide squad, or maybe she's not. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the one introducing the suicide squad, does not make this clear. It's one of many unanswered questions I had at this point of the movie, and still have after now long after the movie ended.Another, who is Amanda Waller and why is she the one assembling this team? Why did she put the bottle containing Enchantress's brother on her nightstand instead of a secure location? Why did the writers choose to make Killer Croc so uncomfortably racist? Actually, why is Killer Croc even a thing at all? After the intros, Enchantress frees her brother and the two wreak havoc on the city. Cue the suicide squad deployment. Big battle. You get the gist.Despite immense potential and the occasional epic moment, the movie's sloppiness overshadows the high points. I imagine it was hastily rewritten or re-shot a couple times before final edits, so that probably caused the film's scattered nature and often unfocused plot.As many flaws as Suicide Squad has, at least it's better than Fantastic Four.",Suicide Squad
297,wildlife-ptech,Begins well but then becomes unintersting mess,4,23 October 2019,Rating4/10This film begins well as we get to know various members of the Squad. Sadly the story collapses in the middle and becomes an unintersting special effects laden mess. Viola Davis is ok but doesn't suit the tone of the film.Mediocre,Suicide Squad
298,JaydoDre,A mess but not as bad as people make it out to be,6,8 January 2017,"This movie is a mess. It had a troubled production. Scenes have been cut and re-cut and then re-cut again. The story structure is not great and the exposition is nauseatingly blunt. The movie just writes parts of the story on the screen and then characters occasionally just explain what's happening or who someone is.And it is insultingly dumb, in every meaning of this word. I do not even know where best to begin. The movie is about a gang of people, most of whom don't have superpowers, fighting an incredible magic evil, but the movie also establishes that superman exists, so that makes no sense. The movie shows a bunch of pillars get destroyed in a subway but in one of the following scenes the same columns are only damaged. People will constantly blurt out unnecessary exposition or explanations, as if this movie was for mentally disabled. A screen in a government control room at one point shows the destruction of satellites and remote facilities from perfect angles, as if there are cameramen at each location filming at just the right moment.However, the actors all do a good job, including the ones you wouldn't think were good actors. The strange look of the new Joker doesn't work for The Joker, just like everyone thought it wouldn't, but it does fit this specific character in this specific movie. The story, although simple and poorly put together, does make some basic sense. The movie looks cool.It is essentially a dumb super-hero movie with style. It is harmless enough to run at an evening party.",Suicide Squad
299,swordsnare,Suicide Dud?,5,4 November 2019,"The screenplay and plot wasn't much to speak of. The 'action' in the second act felt very much like it was filmed on a studio street set at Universal Studios. Jared Leto's method acting style didn't pay off as his portrayal of the Joker. If it wasn't for the charismatic Will Smith and Margot Robbie, it would be a hard pass for me. It's probably the only redeemable things about this film. Can see why they green lit a Harley Quinn based film in Birds of Prey.",Suicide Squad
300,overwatchgengi,Suicide Squad is Terrible,2,21 February 2020,"This film has terrible acting and writing on top of being cut into pieces by the editing. It's choppy, messy and hard to watch.

301,papanloveu,Disappointed!!,2,6 August 2021,"This is really just not that good. In fact, it's kinda bad. First things first, the first 10 minutes of the movie, have more songs than one whole movie. The first ten minutes is like a musical with music that doesn't fit the characters once so ever. And every time Dead shot was introduced, they played rap music because, and only because of the fact that he's black. That's the only reason. Already of to a good start. Killed croc has like enough words to fill in a speech bubble in a comic book and don't do al the much. The only stand outs are Harley, Boomer, and no one else. Although, the Mask... wait no I meant Joker, is pretty ok. I mean he laughs, has green hair, and laughs. Ok and his laugh is like a goose noice. I swear is you play his scenes on a beach, you will have dozens of geese storming your area because they think there is another goose in the movie. The only character development is two seconds long for each of the characters. This pops up at the beginning with the whole musical and their will be a description of the character, which can only be read, when your at home. So at the movie theater you don't know the backstories to anyone.Oh the characters really like to point out the obvious a lot. El Diablo set blaze to his family and at the end when he sacrifices himself, he says that he doesn't want to loose another family, which makes no sense because there was no chemistry between anyone. Oh and fire guy gets in an explosion and dies. Fire man dies from fire.Last thing that I can think of at the moment, is when joker is saving Harley, Amanda Waller wants her to die and so tries to detonate the bomb in her head but, joker jams that and so she tells dead shot to kill Harley. She tells him this even though she is surrounded by military men with guns. So those guys are useless.",Suicide Squad
302,kunalkhandwala,Not dark or twisted enough but fun nevertheless,8,17 August 2016,"In its 3rd outing of the DC Extended Universe, Warner Brothers too, has realized that its true- to-comicbook superheroes are overwhelmingly appreciated only by their ardent fans while the rest of the world continues to bat an eye to the studio's massive efforts. DC's villains have always been the more twisted, psychotic and vile lot that took years for Batman and other masked vigilantes to overcome. Now, in an effort to fight fire with fire, an U.S. Intelligence Officer assembles an unusual team of incarcerated meta-humans who will serve to protect mankind. David Ayer ('Street Kings', 'End of Watch', 'Fury') attempts to make heroes out of villains with an unusual cast of very capable actors with some intriguing overlapping themes that will tie-in with future DC ventures. The Suicide Squad has nothing to lose and that might just be their strength against a paranormal threat to the world.Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) insists that the Government must have a team of meta-humans to fight against forces that have greater powers. Col. Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), with his experience in leading black ops teams, heads the squad with a convincing threat to keep them from escaping. Boomerang (Jai Courtney), the snappy Australian has sharp, electric boomerangs and his ruthlessness as his weapons. Killer Croc is best in his element; the dark, damp sewers and holes that others won't venture into. He is also mighty strong. Diablo (Jay Hernandez) remains aloof and concerned about his powers for good reason. He carries the burden of a disturbing past and with enough motivation, can be quite destructive with his fire. Katana (Karen Fukuhara) bears the samurai sword that traps the souls of its victims. While keeping the squad in check, she can wield it to deadly effect. Deadshot (Will Smith) was a solitary hit-man, renowned and feared worldwide for his marksmanship. That was until the Bat caught him. Harley Quinn (Margott Robbie) is the life of the squad with a carefree attitude even in the face of adversity. But the attitude, being jestful, can also be quite unpredictable. She draws her craziness from Mr. J himself whose influence on her has her smitten. One of the other intended recruits, June Moone (Cara Delevingne), is overpowered by the ancient spirit that shared her physical being. The Enchantress suddenly turns against mankind, deeming them responsible for her imprisonment. Waller calls for the Squad who are yet non trusting of each other but must comply with Flag's command. A combat with a large army of monsters, depicts the incredible talent of Deadshot and following his example, the Suicide Squad sets out on the mission to save the world from the giant beacon pointing at the night sky. Suicide Squad has an admittedly banal plot. What keeps it interesting is the chemistry between these villains as they grow to appreciate each other's strengths and their unpredictable natures. Then there is Jared Leto's Joker that commands attention for his distinct but wicked take on the most challenging villain. He is no Heath Ledger but his laugh and cold bloodedness make him quite a sinister Joker. There is a lot of action that gives each of the squad members their moment of glory. Yet the predictable nature of the plot somehow prevents the narrative from being dark or evil. David Ayer had a lot of potential to make a really twisted movie with villains at its core but in the end, they end up being a team of meta-humans who need to save the world. The background score is a lot of fun with several re-tuned classics. The special effects suit the capabilities of the characters in action sequences while the make-up team deserves a special mention for the exemplary work with the Joker, Killer Croc, Enchantress, Diablo and Harley Quinn. The very objective of this Squad is suicidal. By putting themselves on the line, they can get their terms in prison reduced. They have the capability to overcome great odds even when the world views them negatively. Such is the case with DC's films and its enthusiasts will enjoy Suicide Squad more so for its integration with the Extended Universe.7.837 on a scale of 1-10.",Suicide Squad

However, my kids wanted to see this movie and I agreed to go along.I wasn't expecting much, but I was quite surprised, as this wasn't your typical (anti) superhero movie. Still a lot of silly characters (Killer Croc, what the heck was that?), but the story line, action, and dialog were pretty good.Margot Robbie stole the show however. She did an amazing job. I was very impressed. Will Smith was pretty good as well; not his usual over the top arrogant character. Well, maybe a little, but not as much as some of his movies.

304,happy_hangman,Just...not good,4,17 October 2016,"'Suicide Squad' is, it has to be said, a bit of a mess. Not the out-and-out car-crash many reviewers claim, to be fair, but a prime example of a film made by committee. 'Hey, guys', you can imagine some Exec ejaculating with cynical glee 'Smart-arse, mis-matched teams with lots of comic one liners and post-modern comic- culture references work for Marvel Studios...let's try THAT!"" Enter Will Smith playing...um...Will Smith. Hello, CGI Croc - revelling in his grotesquery. Hey, putting Scarlett Johansson in a leather cat-suit worked...so put Margot Robbie in a ripped t- shirt...no, even better, a ripped WET t-shirt...will be EVEN BETTER! And the '70s soundtrack thing from 'Guardians of the Galaxy'...yeah, we'll do THAT, too. This is, essentially, David Ayer trying to make a DC movie in a Marvel style...without really understanding why those films work. All down to character, Davey. 'Suicide Squad' tries to do too much all at once. Katana, Croc, Boomerang and Enchantress are pretty much undeveloped one-note characters who exist only to make overlong CGI fight sequences just a little bit longer. Viola James' turn as Amanda Waller is nicely nasty, but unlikeable – which is, admittedly, kind of the point of her character, but it makes it difficult for viewers to see her rescue as A Good Thing. What the POINT of Enchantress and her 'machine' was remains a mystery, possibly because Cara Delevigne's performance is so oddly out of step with everything else in the plot. Jay Hernandez tries hard to be the moral centre of the story, but all his effort is wasted: he's essentially ONLY there to give the CGI guys something else to do to pad-out a weak plot. Smith is good, but under-used. A solo outing for his character might be a better option. The big surprise, for me, is Jared Leto. His wild-card Joker is interesting enough – including elements of Ledger and Hamill, but sufficiently divergent from both to remain original, and to be genuinely unpredictable. No obvious chemistry with Robbie, but a character which could – and most likely WILL – be effectively developed in Affleck's forthcoming Batman film.",Suicide Squad
305,fredschaefer-406-623204,"Ignore the critics, make up your own mind.",8,6 August 2016,"Let me say up front that the critics are full of it; SUICIDE SQUAD is a fun movie, a good action film filled with great characters played by well cast actors. I think part of the problem is that for the past year we've been watching one great trailer after the other and really had very high expectations for the movie; as it is, SUICIDE SQUAD has a story filled with some well worn comic book tropes and a script that needed some revisions; I will say that SUICIDE SQUAD's script is not as clunky as the one for BATMANVSUPERMAN, but it is the same problem, and keeps the movie from knocking it out of the park.I must admit that I'm a big fan of the rag tag group of misfits coming together to perform an impossible mission story, be it THE DIRTY DOZEN or THE AVENGERS. As everyone knows from the comics, the SUICIDE SQUAD is one such group, made up of imprisoned super villains and under the control of the formidable Amanda Waller, who wants a team capable of going up against an evil meta human on the level of Superman if it should ever be necessary. One of the best things about the film is how it speeds through the back stories of Deadshot, Diablo, Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, Katana, The Enchantress, and even Harley Quinn, to get the action moving; it's good to have a super hero movie that doesn't spend the first hour on origins and exposition, and then rushing through main plot in the second half. The who and the what are quickly established, the principle threat arrives and the team goes into action and the movie heads toward the inevitable showdown with the Big Bad.That is when SUICIDE SQUAD nearly goes into a ditch, for there are some left turns in the third act that all but short circuit the story before it gets back on track just in time for a satisfying conclusion. We get one of those everybody fights everybody throw downs, where the anti social antiheroes must unite as one and take out the villain, using their powers for a good cause for a change. The special effects are fine, even if the lighting is too dark as it was in BvS. Of course there are some things that do make for head scratching, like how convenient for the plot that Waller has the entire world's defense secrets tucked away in her mind for the villain to read and how Harley Quinn is ready to die for her new friends only minutes after nearly deserting them for the Joker.And that is another problem with SUICIDE SQUAD: of the vast rogue's gallery in the DC universe, why go with the one they chose; especially when you've got the Joker already in the script. I would much rather have seen have seen a movie where Waller, Deadshot and company had squared off against the Joker and Harley; when you've already hauled out the big artillery, you might as well use it to its best advantage.Do we need yet another super hero movie where the villain is determined to take over the world by opening some portal that emits a beam of light into the sky, while debris swirls around in the air? I think GHOSTBUSTERS and THE AVENGERS have pretty much covered that territory.As I said, the cast is great, with Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and Will Smith's Deadshot coming of best. The rest of the crew is well played by Jay Hernandez as Diablo, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Karen Fukahara as Katana, Carla Delavigne as The Enchantress, while Joel Kinnaman is Rick Flagg, the hard case in charge of the Squad. The real draw is finally seeing Harley Quinn brought to life on the screen, and in Margot Robbie they couldn't have made a better choice, this is a star making performance. How good is Jared Leto as The Joker, to me it is a far different take than Jack Nicholson's evil clown or Heath Ledger's canny psycho; Leto brings a real sexual element to the villain as he clearly is in lust with Harley as much as he is in love with her. Whose Joker is best? Let the argument begin; let's just say they have to bring Leto and Robbie back and let them square off against the Big Bat in Gotham.For that matter, who made the best Amanda Waller? Davis is great, but I liked Pam Greir's version from SMALLVILLE a few years back.As for Batman, he does make a cameo, reminding us that Ben Affleck was one of the best things about BATMANVSUPERMAN; and I was intrigued by the brief appearance of Ezra Miller's The Flash. The DC movie universe still had a long way to go before it catches up with Marvel, but SUICIDE SQUAD is a step forward, not the giant leap we hoped it would be. There is a mid credits scene that gives me hope for JUSTICE LEAGUE.",Suicide Squad

307,manuelasaez,The PG-13 rating ruined what could have been the most entertaining Super-hero movie of the year,8,20 October 2016,"I put off watching the film based on the internet consensus that is was ""god-awful"", a travesty, and ""insulting to the source material"". I had very little faith in the movie going in, but having watched Deadpool and realizing how much more amazing a superhero film is when it is catered to adults, I decided to give it a shot and ignore the internet nerds who will take any chance they can get to complain about their beloved comic book based properties. I don't know what movie those people watched, but the Suicide Squad I saw, was entertaining, funny, engaging, visually appealing, and extremely fun in almost every single regard. Aside from the stereotypes played by Will Smith and the dude in the Croc suit, the rest of the cast was interesting and varied, with each anti-hero having their own personality. The stand-outs, of course, being Joker/Harley Quinn and Enchantress, but I really liked what they did with Diablo and his powers, and how they chose to work blue in a very limited PG-13 rating.The last few superhero movies (save for Batman vs. Superman) have been forgettable at best, and downright boring at worst. Captain America: Civil War as a snooze fest, and Avengers 2 was sophomoric, catering to children and teenagers (the Star Wars audience). I loved BvS, and I craved for something more stylish, violent, and indicative of the comics I enjoyed reading. Comic Books have been for adults for several decades now, so to make a superhero film PG-13 is an insult to not only the source material, but the audience as well. Deadpool demonstrated how entirely EPIC a film could be when it didn't talk down to its audience, and the R-rating made for a film that was made by adults, for adults. This is what every stupid needs to aim for with these types films. An anti-hero film with no blood, no foul language, and no sex is like watching a porn with no sex. Watching SQ, I really wished they would have made two versions; the child friendly PG-13 version we got, and the R-rated version the rest of us deserved. To me, this will forever be known as the missed opportunity DC had to be the first to compete in the adult superhero genre of film. DC was a ground breaker when they created Vertigo for their more adult titles; why didn't they have the same confidence for their film properties? This screams of a studio (WB) that was more worried about appeasing children and the child-minded, and making profits, than actually making a wholly compelling picture. As it stands, this film is my favorite superhero movie of the year, and if they ever make a sequel, I really wish that it goes all out in a hard-R rating it deserves.As an aside, it feels like I am in the minority when I say that I prefer Snyder's DC cinematic universe over the one Marvel has created, and it really makes me sad that people would rather have movies made for teenagers and children than have comic book films reflect their adult audience. Comic books are not for children, and the people who read them are not children. Why do the films have to be? It's insulting, it's degrading, and it's disingenuous to the creators of these properties. Stop supporting comic book films that treat their audience like children, and start supporting creators like Snyder that are willing to take a risk with creating a dark, more serious take on the genre of movies that have grown stale, tired and washed out.",Suicide Squad

309,kenyae-cagle,I loved Suicide Squad,8,29 August 2016,This movie was everything I was looking for or waiting for rather. I loved Will Smith as Dead-shot so much so that I had to save a picture of Dead-shot on my phone. Jared Leto played a great Joker and I love the new look on him and I thought he looked pretty cool. Then on top of that I loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn I really loved everything about her and the development as a psychopath who was actually pretty decent at fighting. I didn't like however the witch to the movie and how easy it was for her and her brother to get stopped by the Suicide Squad. I think that the movie was interesting that Batman was more in the movie than I expected him to be. I can't wait to see the next movie or challenge the Suicide Squad and there may be a league that gives justice to the system (pun intended). Great job its about time Hollywood.,Suicide Squad

311,abouhelier-r,Tentamen Suicidii*,9,19 August 2016,"* Latin for a suicide attempt. It is often referred to as a failed suicide attempt or nonfatal suicide attempt. A secret government agency recruits imprisoned supervillains to execute dangerous black ops missions in exchange for clemency.Nevermind Deadpool: Suicide Squad is the bad boy of superhero movies. Defined as ""F****** insane"" in promotional interviews. it's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice's nasty little brother. On paper, Suicide Squad was summer's last best hopes. Its premise was interesting to anyone who's ever found Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader more interesting than Clarice Starling or Luke Skywalker. Intended as an antidote to the rest of the DC Cinematic Universe. If Marvel has the best superheroes, so the prevailing geek logic goes, then DC must have the coolest villains. How ironic then, that a superhero story determined to celebrate the genre's villains should feature the worst villain that the genre has ever seen. Director/writer David Ayer opens the film by attempting to compress origins stories, unique abilities and how they were captured for nine different characters into the film's overload first act. Blasting Hip-Hop songs to show how gangsta they are. In fact, each character is introduced with an instantly recognisable song, helping to ground these super freaks in the world as we know it. While also confirming suspicions that the movie is DC's answer to Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy. Amanda Waller starring Viola Davis, whose self-interest eventually poses the film's only provocative moral dilemma, is going to use those villains: she's going to use fire to fight fire and she's going to get burned. Every character is missing someone. Deadshot misses his daughter, El Diablo misses his wife and Rick Flag his girlfriend. Beside that there's Cara Delevingne's Enchantress, a humanoid crocodile who doesn't contribute much to the team and my old friend Jay Courtney: a dumb Australian guy who contributes even less to the team. And THEN, there's Dr. Harleen Quinzel aka Harley Quinn aka Margot Robbie, who is sexualised as hell and a caricature of male fetishism. Plus, she's ""potentially"" a poor representation of psychological abuse. Though I loved her character. Moreover, Will Smith hopefully has been given good characterisation within small but thorough lines and some touches of humanity, just like Harley Quinn underneath her unhinged insanity. Will Smith charisma and wit unable him to throw one-liners like no one else, giving the movie a comic aspect without it turning into full mode comedy. This is not the Joker's film we were all waiting for. But must surely be a taste of things to come in future sequels. Attempting to honour the history of the character without stepping on Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson's toes, Jared Leto creates a surprisingly sensual Joker. He's part gangster, part clown, but nor really part of the movie unfortunately. His character is reduced to a long cameo of some sort. Giving the audience a feeling of second movie within the movie they're currently watching. The brief Batman's appearances are awesome, Ben Affleck is amazing as Batman and I can't wait to see this man again in new Batman features. Blame it on Batman, but the DCCU has gotten awfully dark in recent years, especially compared with the candy-coloured party they're having over at Marvel. Finally critics often complain that overcrowded comic-book movies don't devote enough energy to psychology or performances, focusing instead on action and big CGI set-pieces. But Suicide Squad strays in the opposite extreme. Though this film is full of fancy action sequences in which our anti-heroes fight off a bunch of anonymous CG baddies (like the Avengers) while exchanging witty one-liner (just like the Avengers) and using their various abilities to emerge victorious without breaking a sweat (like, guess who? the AVENGERS!). I don't really like to trash a movie and you know that but certain aspect of the second and third acts reminded me of Fantastic Four, yes, it is that messy. Overall, Suicide Squad flips the script around and forces the audience to root for the bad guys. But is this enough? Clearly: NO. This film is not half as badass as you wanted it to be.",Suicide Squad
312,j_forbesy,Suicide Squad Review,7,6 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was a movie that at the start of the year I wasn't all that hyped for. But as the months went past and the marketing started to kick in, a week before the movie I was completely pumped to see it. Fast forward a week later however, and we were faced with negative reviews from the critics, a fan petition to take down Rotten Tomatoes and director David Ayer having to come out to defend his movie. I'd be lying if I said that all these external influences didn't play into how a viewed this film.Overall, I had fun with this movie. I'm someone who sits on the side that really loved the dynamics of the team and loved everything about the Suicide Squad itself, but the story, villain and some of the directing choices really let the film as a whole down. With reports now coming out that there is another version of this film floating around somewhere, which seems to be something the the DC films are starting to have in common. Like I mentioned, there were many scenes from the trailers that didn't appear in the film which I really want to see, so hopefully, there is going to be some form of ultimate edition on the Blu Ray like BvS. On a side note though, this is my favourite theatrical DCEU and this was one of those situations like BvS where it was expectation verse reality.7/10 - See full review at thenotsonerdynerd.wordpress.com/",Suicide Squad
313,n-kefala,Wasted potential,5,19 August 2016,"Beyond the interesting aesthetic, ""Suicide Squad"" doesn't really have much going for it and is nothing more than a film dedicated to Batman and Superman's enemies in which they compare their abilities to see who's the best of all. Thanks to some interesting characters, this is a fun film to watch, but not as much fun as it should have been. It's actually disappointing to see all that potential wasted. But despite some major flaws, this film has good performances from Will Smith and Margot Robbie and a few solid action scenes.

314,lediscipledessocrates,A Bad & Boring Feel-Good Buddy Movie,2,12 September 2016,"If there ever was a lifetime achievement award for clichés , Suicide Squad can give many flicks a run for their money. Projected as new generation super-villain turned hero flick , this film does miserably in creating any credible impression at all. Why? Let's start. To begin with we have Harley Quinn, the show stealer in the promos. However, this ""psychopathic b****"" is actually paprika to the untrained eye- looks red but isn't hot. In fact even as I write this, I can think of far more demented bad girls in movies { think Famke Janssen as the cold psycho killing machine in Golden Eye ( 1995) or say Chiaki Kuriyama the teenaged lunatic in Kill Bill Vol I (2003) } . So the bar was really set high for Margot Robbie , and frankly she has been duped . Harley Quinn is neither scary nor demented. There are scenes where she resembles Charlie's Angels. The director pushes in the oomph factor and that's about it.Next in line is a guy who starred in The Pursuit of Happiness (2006) and then for some inexplicable reason featured in movies such as After Earth (2013) and now this. He plays a super-hit-man . Now, you may have a few nasty things to say about Wanted(2008) but I confess , that movie with bullet bending calisthenics had a special appeal in the hit-man series. Not taking too much space we have a bunch of other bad guys , harda*** who for some reason become self righteous buddies in a jiffy. Come on. This is unbearable and embarrassing. The real bad guys in the movie are equally irritating , what with absolutely no novelty, brow beaten power surges, ""magic"" and silly costumes. Last and definitely the least we have two extremely annoying characters "" Amanda Waller""and ""Flag"" played disastrously by Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman respectively. These two bring down the movie to a whole new level. They can be described as the antithesis of tough-no-bullshit hard**** guys/girls with a pretentious attitude. OK, this is getting long. But a few words about the story. There isn't any. And if there is it is merely a subverted version of many ""get the bad guys of the jail to fight for you classics"" .The actions sequences are boring ( many being funny one to one fist fights. Now, why didn't the witch use magic to annihilate these threats ??) .The one-liners drab, the screenplay dusty. If you want my opinion please watch this movie only if you on a 11 hour flight and there absolutely nothing else to do ( and that includes visiting the loo).I am giving it 2 for the movie's title . That is the only saving grace.",Suicide Squad
315,carologletree,"It Has Some Fun Moments and Some Solid Performances, but It's Still a Pretty Weak Movie Overall",5,9 July 2017,"I saw the premiere of this movie with some friends last year. We had fun watching it and we liked it. However, after rewatching it on X-Finity and reevaluating it, the movie isn't really that good. There are some things in it to keep you entertained, but it is still another weak film from the DCEU.I liked Will Smith as Deadshot. This is an unusual thing for Smith to play an assassin, but he pulled it off well, and his character was pretty interesting. I also liked Harley Quinn. This was the first time the character was adapted to live action, and Margot Robbie was convincing in the role.There were also some pretty good action sequences and the film did get a few laughs out of me.Sadly, all the other villains on the team were considerably less interesting and didn't get enough character development to really get behind them. The interactions between the villains were pretty forced for the most part.Jared Leto was pretty good as The Joker, but he was wasted because he was barely in the movie at all.The story was very weak and the pacing could have been a lot better. Also bad is the depressingly murky color palette. Some bright colors in the film couldn't hurt, you know!A lot of people think that this is even worse than ""Batman v. Superman,"" but I disagree. I enjoyed it more than that film because at least this film is fairly entertaining at times and had a few good performances. However, this is still a mostly unsuccessful effort from the DCEU. Thankfully, things would get much better with the next DCEU film, ""Wonder Woman.""RATING: C",Suicide Squad
316,SpoilerAlertReviews,Great but badly put together...,7,7 August 2016,"David Ayer is fast becoming the 'hit or miss' director for me, releasing instant classics like End of Watch (2012) and Fury (2014) but also great disappointments like Sabotage (2014) and now this. But wait two minutes while I retort myself and say there are some amazing parts and a lot of good things to say about this movie however it's poorly put together; Ayer had some incredible scenes but wasn't able to join them all up in any good way. The story, also written by Ayer was a surprising twist to what was expected, with the trailers not really giving anything away I was assuming it was going to be the squad Vs the Joker as the trailer might suggest, but far from it and it loosely centers around the Enchantress going rogue, I suppose the right term would be, going from bad to worse. It's certainly comic book fashion Super villains are forcibly recruited to carry out do-or-die missions by way of Wedlock, and whilst some of the plot seems to focus on Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, the rest of the characters feel very rushed, like they ran out of time. It's a clever attempt at having several subplots, linking the recent DCuniverse in, but to go lovey-dovey takes away the nastiness resulting it in becoming cheesy and clichéd towards the end (it's always about a girl.) Cara Delevinge plays the enchantress who manages to part company, revives her godlike brother, create a legion of grotesque mutants and goes Gozer on Gotham with only the remains of the squad to try stop her. I'm undecided about Joel Kinnaman, wasn't too keen on the new Robocop but loved him in Run All Night. Jay Hernandez made an explosive Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc wasn't quite believable to me, parts looking a lot like body paint, but I think Jai Courtney's Boomerang worked best for me, if Bane was cocky and was from Australia. Batfleck is in the film, but obviously off hero hunting whilst his city turns into a scene from Ghostbusters. Margot Robbie is probably the best thing about this film, bringing Harley Quinn to life in such a beautiful manner, raising sarcasm to a whole new level of cuteness and downright sinister. There isn't enough of Jared Leto's Joker, who is good, but just doesn't take the lead from Heath Ledger. This one is definitely more the comic book/animated joker and his dress sense is fabulous, but he's more of a tease than an actual character in the film. There's some amazing scenes like Deadshot going trigger happy and Ayer has some incredible vision like The Joker and Harley Quinn going toxic. The finale is actually beautifully shot, it's just badly filled with smaller, weaker scenes that taint the film overall. The action is good enough, and again, some impressive camera work and great use of colour giving it that vibrant video game feel yet still dark and gritty. One particular scene actually reminded me of Aliens, especially when Deadshot goes Chuck Norris on the horde of mutants. Steven Price reunites from Fury to do an unnoticeable score or could it be it got played out by the awesome explicit soundtrack with tracks like Panic! At The Disco's Bohemian Rhapsody, Eminem's Without Me and songs like Sucker For Pain, You Don't Own Me and an uncredited Sympathy For The Devil which was also used with Will Smith in Focus. I'm was trying to decide if I was ultimately let down by the hype or the actual film, but it's unfortunately both. Some great potential but not of the right consistency throughout and this might have something to do with the Warner Bros cut twenty plus minutes from the final film, who knows? Maybe it'll make the director's cut and all will be saved, such a beautiful shame.

317,lucasnochez,Film Review: Suicide Squad,2,9 February 2017,"In a world where audiences cannot get enough of superheroes, comics and geeking over the impossibly feverish fade of comic book hero's adapted onto the big screen, DC Comics is trying to cash in on this highly lucrative cinematic craze by developing a feature length feature, and their competition to The Avengers with Suicide Squad. Yet, if we really look at the bigger picture of Suicide Squad, one can easily see some stark differences, for example; none of the characters are really superheroes but villains; none of the characters presented are really recognizable names, with the exception of The Joker (who isn't even a member of the squad in the film) and Harley Quinn (who is destined to become a household character by the end of this film, with the help of Margot Robbie of course), and, if not most importantly, assembling a team together, including cast and crew, that couldn't be more, disassembled.Quite frankly, Suicide Squad is a complete disaster and mess of a film. The writing of the film is so incoherent, it makes the objective of the team and the audience really question as to why they are doing it altogether. The direction of the film feels forced and almost lacking any artistic creativeness by David Ayer and more-so of a forced studio film shoved down the artistic team's throat, and, the story is just convoluted, discombobulated and weak. Ayer, who was on my radar of becoming one of my fav directors, blending, almost effortlessly, the use of action with real-world comedy, thanks to the near-perfect End of Watch, shits the bed on this one.With such star power, including the uncompromising Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, and the once attached Tom Hardy, you would think Suicide Squad was a film with some massive potential to wreck box-office havoc at the end of a very disappointing 2016. Yet, the film itself is a very sad excuse for a summer blockbuster, insulting its audience with any sort of artistic and cinematic credit.While the narrative of the story has been told before, like seriously, almost exactly like the narrative in the first Avengers. Just to refresh, here is it; A loved one of one of the team members (Thor's brother's Loki in the Avengers and Nick Flag's (Joe Kinnaman) girlfriend June Moone, also know by her villain name Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) in this one, wreck havoc on a city, a team gathers to save the city (New York City in the Avengers, Gotham in this film). Coming out of the gates, the film does not have much street credit.Suicide Squad was easily one of the most anticipated and exciting movies of summer sixteen. The trailer, which features one of the best bands ever assembled singing one of the best musical arrangements ever created, was easily one hell of a ride to watch. Unfortunately, some of the best parts of the film were featured in the trailer, which took away and ruined the film overall, or, the music just brought the best in the footage. After all, its pretty hard not enjoying watching anything while listening to the angelic voice of Freddie Mercury.While the movie did feature the likes of Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the sadistic mastermind behind the formation of the Suicide Squad, in a compelling and completely engaging role as a devilish, heartless and soulless women, who takes her job WAY too seriously, the only real redemption the movie has is Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and I mention those named quite carefully. Notice how I didn't say Deadshot and Harley Quinn, the characters these actors are playing. Smith, who is an excellent actor whom audiences love whole-heartedly, did not play an interpretation of the almost obscure comic book character. Smith, in turn, essentially just plays himself, in a film adaptation where he must kick ass, save the world and give the occasional motivational speech. Its hard not to like Will Smith in anything really (we will completely ignore After Earth), hence why much of the good criticism will come from him, but people will quickly forget that Will Smith is a likable guy, but did he give a spot on, target approve depiction of a DC comic book baddie, heck no.With Margot Robbie, one of the hottest and most attractive Hollywood actresses working today, its hard not to like her in anything, especially when for the duration of the film, she is featured in very sexy short-shorts and ripped nylons, as well as while the camera takes the liberty of shooting her from behind most of the time. Geeks and fanboys, compose yourself! Again, Robbie, A HIGHLY alluring and charming actress, who, if wasn't already, will surely be a house hold name after only one studio film, plays the best version of herself, with some sort of an accent, doesn't really play a version of the iconic sidekick to The Joker, rather, just an amazing companion to Deadshot, which shouldn't be hard, especially since the two have shared the screen before in Focus, showing the same caliber chemistry as Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The chemistry between the two is so good, it comes to no wonder why Jada Pinkett Smith was worried when rumours were circulating about affair rumours between the two.",Suicide Squad
318,mrpicky,They made drag queen out of Joker,4,4 August 2016,"To sum it up in a few words: Will Smith would be better off in Independence Day. You can be skeptical about any movie if there is too many big characters in it, usually trying to compensate for poor story. And if movie was not pre-released to critics, also raises suspicion. Well, Suicide Squad is as poor as Batman vs Superman. Lack of imagination, poor characters, poor story, very poor action scenes. Without adult/director supervision Will goes towards a man-child which he is in real life. So we have a poorly finished cartoon character instead of main one. Margot Robbie finding role of her life, but then suddenly braking out of characters(pre-madness and after)in one scene. Cara Delevingne acting is just one big Facepalm. The one character that is remotely interesting is the Boomerang fellow. He looked like he was trying to get out of that ridiculous movie, when couldn't - just stood there drinking beer. But worst of all: They made drag queen out of Joker, also Joker is sad most of the movie.",Suicide Squad
319,gcsman,"""The Dirty Dozen"" meets ""The Mummy"" ...",4,5 August 2018,"...but without the verve or charm that either of those two older movies had. The settings and staging are dark to the point of obsession, and I don't just mean the overall tone of the plot and script. The whole look of it is dark, dirty, and grimy, as if exposing any given scene to sunlight would reveal it for the ridiculousness that it is. A low-life bunch of criminals is conscripted to take down a mystic villain and her long-dead and now resurrected consort. Attempts to make this believable are hard going right from the start and never becoming convincing.What's probably worse though is the derivative nature of what's going on. There's actually nothing original here; any scene is something we've seen before in a different context. Same for the script, which is filled with trite dialog on all sides. The acting? The thing about a bad script and bad premise like this is that it tends to flatten everything, drag all the actors down with it to the same uniform low level even if they're capable people to begin with. There is actually almost no one here among the characters who you feel like rooting for or identifying with. Probably the only cast members who escape with their dignity intact are Will Smith (whose inimitable style seems to be able to carry him through anything) and Viola Davis (whose harder-than-nails Amanda Waller actually borders on believable -- though even she looks like she's rather be somewhere else). I know Margot Robbie is getting credit for standing out among this low bunch, but to me she looked trapped, as if ""how did I get involved in this mess?""was coming out through her eyes whenever she said or did something. Give her credit for trying. As for all the rest, they behave like escapees from the Monty Python School for Overacting. Adam Beach is probably glad that his character got killed off early.What remains is the special effects and CGI. Not bad, but ugliness overtakes them too. The Enchantress (Cara Delavigne) villain does leave a strong impression in both her guises, as some sort of tribal priestess and then as a powerful ancient-god kind of creature, but otherwise the highlights are few.Hard to believe they're intending to make a SS 2 (news as of mid-2018) rather than working on the more promising paths of the DCEU that are starting to open up. This however is probably more a statement about the standards of the studio and Hollywood in general than about anything related to quality.",Suicide Squad

It is worth a watch, I found it entertaining. However, I came away with a sense that this could (and should) have been so much better. If you like the genre you can turn a blind eye to many short comings but this film felt half made. The plot so banal that it was probably written on the back of an envelope while taking a dump. In short : Government fears another 'Superman' may not be a good guy (didn't actually explain what happened to Superman).So create team of criminals with superpowers (or no superpowers) ready to fight any super baddies. To make sure they behave insert explosive device in neck that can be remotely detonated. One of team is possessed by 'enchantress' a thousands of year old being with unknown powers. She manages to get away and co- incidentally finds long lost fellow brother being. Together they begin to create mayhem. Criminal team sent in and beat bad guys then go back to prison. What i liked : Will Smnith as 'Deadshot' and Margot Robbie as 'Harly Quinn' both stood out in their roles Jared Leto as 'Joker' also (but not quite) with a similar portrayal to heath ledger except the character seemed under used. What I did not particularly like: The other characters were pretty much un-inspiring to the point of boring. Cara Delevingne I found particularly annoying and illustrated that 'eye candy' is not a substitute for an actor. Viola Davis as 'Amanda Waller' didn't come across as tough/ruthless.All in all, a few good characters and a crowd of boring ones, looking for a plot. Entertaining but unsatisfying 7/10",Suicide Squad
321,Tehmeh,Almost like a 2-hour long music video collection.,4,6 August 2016,"I know nothing about Suicide Squad as a property, so I can only compare it to other movies in the genre and of course movies in general. Zero emotional investment beforehand can sometimes reward you.""Suicide Squad"" feels like a movie that could've been many things, but ended up being almost nothing. There are many glimpses of engaging and good ideas or moments, but they all seem to drown under meaningless noise, montages, flashbacks and a playlist consisting of some classic rock songs along with some more modern stuff. I thought I would like the soundtrack and the score based on the trailers and some songs choices, but I ended up hating it. It's used in all the wrong ways and it took me out of the movie more than anything else. One song ends, another starts, and it's not organic or skillfully woven to the story. It feels like a cynical effort to be a part of some trend instead of serving any real creative purpose.Tones can shift and that's alright, it keeps things interesting. But here, almost everything is forced. You can be in the middle of a scene, and out of the blue you get a cheap, emotionally manipulative tonal shift that breaks the focus. It doesn't feel natural. Every time this movie tries to make you care, it tries really hard. You can ever hear it: If it tries to make you sad, the music goes to ULTIMATE SAD. If it tries to make you excited over a boring action scene where faceless demon cronies get bullets and fists to their face, the music goes to ULTIMATE HEAVENLY BATTLE MUSIC. Absolute overkill. Sometimes the score doesn't even seem to know what the movie is showing. The composed score in itself would be alright, possibly even very good if used differently or in a whole other movie.Technically, for a PG-13 action fantasy movie, ""Suicide Squad"" is decent. It's shot well enough, and it's fluid in its own way. It's mostly dark, shot at night or in dark locations, which is fitting but executed in an almost dull way. At some points the cinematography looks nice. Many stylized ""cool shots"" are there. Special effects are good at some parts, and the camera held its own in action scenes. Still, I felt nothing watching the action. It was competent and visually not horrible, but there was an emotional disconnect like in a music video; something technically good might be happening, but it feels vacuous and empty. It didn't have weight to it, no matter how many shots were fired. I liked watching the other stuff more. It's hard to say anything about the writing. They had tons of material, some good ideas and a few interesting character moments but nothing connected into an exciting, tight story. A few times when there was a flashback, I wanted to see those stories instead of the one I got. It wasn't that hard to follow, but it was scattered. I failed to see the beating heart of the story. The villain didn't get me excited, and many lines were just ""lines"" instead of real dialogue. It's hard to say anything about Ayer's directing either, because I don't know how much control he had over this movie. I'll give him this though: the movie was very fast-paced and economical in the way all of the information was dumped on the audience. It's bound to be that way with so many montages and snippets, but at least it didn't all fall apart. I can only imagine what the result would have been with little to no intervention from studio execs who just have to have their slimy hands all over these movies. Margot Robbie and Will Smith are the leads. Will Smith is charismatic enough that he didn't even need to act, he was just casually throwing lines around, and that was enough. Robbie is the one who put up a performance, becoming Harley Quinn. She is just the right kind of mixture of sexy, cute, crazy, quirky, dangerous and vulnerable. She even sold me on one of those emotionally manipulative scenes, when everything around her didn't. She had plenty of horrible lines, but managed to rise over her material. Her outfit is the most colourful of the entire cast too, so naturally the camera loves her in a movie where everything is dark. Take Robbie out of the movie, and you got nothing. Kinnaman, Davis and Hernandez were decent, I guess. The ""Killer Croc"" made me cringe a couple of times. They wasted a really charismatic actor for that?About performances, I didn't like Jared Leto's Joker. Almost every moment felt pretentious, forced and the wrong kind of insane. As if he was playing a drug addict doing crazy villain impressions. I like Jared Leto, but if this was his idea, then someone should have said something. I doubt Leto was in control though. I know that the Joker was supposed to be just a side character, and he was. Nevertheless, it felt like a poker game where they didn't have much of a hand, but they still wanted to overplay their hand each time he was on screen. To summarize, ""Suicide Squad"" tried too hard. If it ever had a voice of its own, it was butchered by studio executives and a scattered structure. It felt like a collection of music videos. Not only because of its soundtrack, but also how the story was handled. You get glimpses of something, then it's over, and another tune begins. In the end, almost nothing stuck with me and I felt quite numb, bored and exhausted. That said, this can still work as a popcorn movie, especially if you care about this property and characters. It's technically sound, fast-paced, packing some good short moments and Margot Robbie is good in it. That much you'll get, but not anything beyond that.",Suicide Squad
322,troy-manatunga,Half Baked,6,14 August 2016,"The DC Universe has only begun its unveiling. Do you think what lies ahead is promising if the 2016 releases are of any indication of what is in store for us?First it was ""The Bat"" taking on the ""Son of Krypton"" in a disputably excessive run time (Although the DC Universe has a lot of groundwork to set up for the 2017 line up). Second – SUICIDE SQUAD!Deadshot (Will Smith) wants to be the only villain of Gotham City. Trapped between the greed of power to reign as the Alpha in Gotham, and the tears of his daughter, he is apprehended by Batman and is incarcerated. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) & Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) employed by a secret government agency are attempting to recruit Deadshot, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Slipknot (Adam Beach) to run secret black-ops missions as deniable assets for the agency. This team of supervillains are assembled sooner than foreseen when yet another asset escapes and goes rouge creating havoc across the city. The Irony of all this – the asset that goes rouge, is none other than June Moone (Cara Delevingne) the lover of team leader Rick Flag. In terms of a plot, there is absolutely too much going on already and The Joker (Jared Leto) is not even in the picture yet.Directed & Written by David Ayer SUICIDE SQUAD is a half-baked visual marvel. It has everything that a superhero/supervillain movie should have in the department of its original soundtrack, the CGI, makeup and costuming. What baffles me is the fact of what Warner Bros was thinking when the screenplay was initially approved for production? At least with the Marvel Franchises the backstories were clearly laid for each character prior to the Assembly, The Bat Vs SM too can be excused since Nolan and Snyder told the story before. Unless you grew up reading every single comic book, you will be lost in this debacle of a screenplay. The writing is in shambles but David Ayer and his cast certainly didn't take a knife to a gun fight. They gear up, cover up most of the loopholes and punch their way through. Even absolutely short-lived, the Jared Leto performance is Gold. Don't bat your eyes or the joker will be gone! If the character was written better, his performance would have made an AA nod in 2017, but with this screenplay its unlikely.The elephant in the room? Will Smith? Let's agree that he is the money man aka ""The Face"" for this blockbuster. Would it have been better to star someone else? No, Will Smith does it alright. A noteworthy performance on the other hand, falling behind Leto, is Margot Robbie, every second of her Harley is entertaining, enthusiastic and authentic, seems like she did a lot of research to pull this one off on such a high level. How I hope for a standalone movie of Harley and her pudding. Fanboys will be excited. New to the genre? Best read up on your comics. You may find a ring tone for your phone too.TITLE: SUICIDE SQUAD DIRECTED BY: David AYER STARRING: WILL SMITH, VIOLA DAVIS, JOEL KINNAMAN, MARGOT ROBBIE, JAI COURTNEY, JAY HERNANDEZ, ADEWALE AKINNUOYE-AGBAJE, ADAM BEACH, CARA DELVINGNE, KAREN FUKUHARA & JARED LETO RATED: PG13 RATING: 06/10 RUNTIME: 123 MINUTES",Suicide Squad
323,Jonathon_Natsis,The Worst Heroes Ever turn the DCEU upwards in this joyful romp.,8,4 August 2016,"When the world first met Superman, we were lucky he liked us. Spec ops operator Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) doesn't want to take that chance with the next metahuman. She assembles a special unit of career criminals to work as a last line of defense against supernatural threats, in exchange for shorter prison sentences and other such perks. But Waller's arrogance works against her when one of the squad, Enchantress (Cara Delevigne), goes rogue and awakens her ancient brother in a bid to make humanity worship her once more. It's now up to this rag-tag band of misfits to save the very people that ruined their lives. Lurking in the shadows of this simple story is The Joker (Jared Leto), who can't bear to be away from his Harley (Margot Robbie) and will stop at nothing to get her back in his crazy arms.Director David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, Fury) is no stranger to ensemble filmmaking, and he's in his comfort zone here. Some characters are more important than others, certainly, but everyone gets their time to shine. De facto leader Deadshot (Will Smith) is wonderfully fleshed out as a devoted dad/serial killer, who can fire off a round almost as fast as he can shoot off his mouth. Davis is chilling as the callous, unflinching Waller: a woman confident enough to handle things herself, but not too proud to call for ""help"" if it gets things done faster.Jay Hernandez is El Diablo, a former West Coast gang member whose inability to keep a cool head - literally - leaves him on the sidelines while his squad-mates do the fighting. Haunted by the sins of his past, Diablo is the cathartic heart of a film you'd otherwise expect to leave such emotional soul-searching at the door. Robbie's Quinn is more The Animated Series than Arkham series. Her whimsy is matched only by her mean streak, though there are fleeting moments where she displays her last lingering shred of sanity, struggling vainly to break free amongst the madness in her mind. Leto's Joker is an enigma. Far too psychotic for your average villainous crime lord, yet too cold and calculating for the Clown Prince of Crime. Nonetheless, he makes the role his own.The greatest pleasure of Suicide Squad comes simply from sitting back and watching each of these characters interact with one another. Indeed, the story is so refreshingly basic that the film demands we make our focus the characters, and how they fit into a world that deserves them, but ultimately doesn't need them. The entire affair abounds in levity and simplicity, two unchecked boxes that hurt Batman v Superman in a way that ultimately caused irreversible damage. This trim, taut tale told in a touch under two hours – almost unheard of for modern blockbusters – moves briskly without feeling choppy. The film is let down by a little too much exposition (perhaps necessary for viewers unfamiliar with the characters) and some occasionally schlocky, melodramatic dialogue, but those minor gripes do little to detract from the overall experience.A long time coming since the disappointing events of BvS, Suicide Squad turns the DC cinematic universe in an entirely new direction: one of joy, excitement and boundless entertainment.",Suicide Squad
324,pere-25366,An absolute mess of a 'movie' that succumbs to familiar formulas,4,6 August 2016,"Firstly, I think it is fair to say that Suicide Squad does not merit all the backlash it has received thus far, especially from critics. Certainly this film deserves a fate better than a 25% rotten tomatoes score that is akin to films like House of Wax and Howard the Duck. With such massive hype surrounding its release, DC was certainly hard-pressed to deliver. But alas, here we are and while this film isn't perfect, it does get some things right and provides its viewers with ample entertainment. At the end of the day though, this 'movie', though it doesn't even merit that status, is an utter mess.One aspect of this film I felt it struggled to offer us was an adequate backstory for many of its main characters. As a result, we're left with a flurry of personalities that frankly feels a little messy and disorganized. But perhaps it is somewhat paradoxical to learn about the psyche of characters who are anything but human. With visually fantastical super villains like Enchantress, Killer Croc and El Diablo, this film is certainly a treat for the eyes more than the brain. There are certainly many plot holes and the occasional cringy dialogue. Even come the film's end, you feel like you have witnessed an under-developed, completely rushed plot that is certainly difficult to genuinely buy into. It fails where films like the Dark Knight have succeeded in creating a believable, sinister atmosphere that transcends the realm of comic book and enters suspenseful thriller material.But if you temper your expectations a little, Suicide Squad presents itself as a somewhat fun, action- packed flick. Viola Davis, Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto (among others) bring their A-game but unfortunately were given a sub-par script to work with. The story-line certainly tries to cram in many superfluous details, injecting Batman into the plot being one. I guess I felt with such a stunning array of characters at their disposal, S.S. left a lot to be desired.",Suicide Squad
325,compugor,Outlstandinly Entertaining,9,19 July 2019,"This is one to enjoy as a collector's item. Casting, screenply and effects call for lots of rewinding and multiple viewings. Awesome action, as the squad comes together through the tensions of their situation. There was something to enjoy about each of the characters. The grey line between ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" is well expressed. Even with some disappointment at the end, you can just let go and enjoy this fabulous fantasy.",Suicide Squad
326,destinylives52,Somewhat entertaining,7,12 November 2016,"With more metahumans coming out of the woodwork, the U.S. government creates a secret, task force made up of metahumans to fight other metahumans who do not have the world's best interests at heart. Viola Davis, playing a top government agent who creates this metahuman squad, unwisely chooses villains to fill out the group. Yes, at first this seems like a ludicrous ideaafter all, how can you trust these villains to do your bidding? And the character of Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbiehow can this psychopath be expected to follow orders, even under the threat of having her head blown off by implanted, miniature explosives? The idea of this ""Suicide Squad"" is so far-fetched, how can the audience blindly accept it and sit back and have fun with the movie? Welllet me tell youThe U.S. putting madmen and psychos under payroll and setting them up to acquire a tremendous amount of power is very real, and very common. Manuel Noriega, Ferdinand Marcos, Osama Bin-Laden, and Saddam Hussein are a few examples. Soooothe idea of the U.S. government hiring maniacs to fight other maniacs isn't that far-fetched after all.Soon after Davis sets up her squad under threats and/or promises of freedom and extra goodies, a metahuman threat arises. Ironically, it is a threat that is borne from a squad member! Will Smith (playing Deadshot) leads the ""Suicide Squad"" into the fight, and as expected, things do not go smoothly. How can it? The squad has never fought as a group before; one is psychotic; another made a promise to himself to not use his powers anymore; two of them just want to escape; and the squad wasn't given the full story of who they are fighting and how this threat came to be. Working together and defeating a powerful enemy will take a miracle, and they need that miracle to happen fast because the entire world is about to end.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Suicide Squad"" is the scene when Robbie finally puts on her outfit. 'Nuff said.""Suicide Squad"" is a reasonably entertaining, somewhat mindless action flick that has two memorable characters: Deadshot and Harley Quinn. While Robbie killed it as Quinn, Smith seemed miscast for his role as Deadshot. Add to this a script that needed more polish and focus, and what could have been a great movie is reduced to one that is just okay.mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Suicide Squad
327,caseynicholson,Not At All as Bad as The Initial Reviews--Good But Not Great,6,9 August 2016,"Despite the initial reviews of this movie being horrible, I decided I'd take it in at a matinée simply because it's a comic book movie and watching it would keep me up to speed with the DC Cinematic Universe. I'm glad I did. This movie isn't at all as bad as the first reviews suggested.Granted, one disclaimer to that statement would be that this isn't a terrible movie for the genre of movie it finds itself in. This is a comic book fan's comic book movie. It's a movie that introduces over half a dozen characters to the silver screen, and a movie whose plot revolves around a somewhat stereotypical ""good"" guys vs. really powerful bad guy type of story.Still, the movie tells its story well for the most part, and the overall production isn't terrible. The characters are likable enough, so much so that it has inspired me to want to look up the ones that I know the least about so as to learn more about their comic book versions. The acting was good on the whole (albeit Will Smith has the uncanny ability to always play Will Smith in any role that he's given), and the effects were tolerable overall, even if a bit underwhelming by today's standards.The biggest flaw I found in the movie is that some of the characters are given more robust introductions than others. Katana, in particular, shows up out of nowhere with little to no introduction outside of a flashback scene that doesn't really tell you much by way of introduction. The lopsidedness of the introductions felt a bit off to me--but I will say that the group seemed to allow for all of the characters to join in the fight scenes as the film progressed, so I suppose that helped to equal out that issue.All that said, I'm giving this movie 6/10 stars. That means that I find this to be a good movie overall, but one that just barely crosses the good/bad movie threshold. It's enjoyable enough, but not really a top notch film that you have to see before you up and die.One last note: It should be obvious enough if you know anything whatsoever about the film or its source material, but this film is violent and uses a lot of foul language--so much so that I'm surprised it got a PG-13 rating. In my opinion it's more rightly an R rated film, and so don't assume that just because this movie is based on a comic book that it's going to be family friendly. It's certainly not that at all.",Suicide Squad
328,freshclean-66-318608,I Was In A Viola Davis Mood.,5,13 February 2017,"Yes, this film was over hyped and blown up to be something it wasn't. DC could have done a way better job with this film. I hope this isn't a sign of some sort of how DC is going to compete with Marvel because if it is Marvel is already victorious. I'm not a comic book fan but I'm fond of some of the films that are made from them. So far ""Suicide Squad"" is the third installment of the DC Extended Universe and so far I'm not really impressed or at least impressed as I was with some of the Marvel films when they came out. The one thing that really made me go out and see this film was Viola Davis' performance. I knew no matter how awful this film might be Viola Davis would stand out. As usual her performance was phenomenal! She's really the only reason I decided to see this film. Actually, this film was comprised of a great cast. Along with Viola Davis there was Jared Leto (The Joker), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Will Smith (Deadshot). Other than that this film is the wrong direction for DC.",Suicide Squad
329,palavitsinis,Weird and confusing but good enough,7,17 October 2016,"First of all, this was a really good idea if you ask me. Secondly, it was really well-made in many parts of the movie. But there was something that didn't fit. Fist things first. I really jumped at the opportunity to watch a movie with all of these antiheroes in it. Loved the concept (not aware of the related comics, so don't judge me for that). When the movie started showing the background of the villains, some of the information about them although playfully presented, were a bit all over the place. Seemed like some things were too much even for such kind of a movie. Didn't appreciate the element of these beings as well. The movie could have been a perfectly nice one, without the addition of the supernatural element in this sense. The story was plausible but on the other hand it seemed like something they cooked up so that they can make a movie. Nothing too special behind it. Overall, it's a seven, only based on the fact that I love this kind of movies. If it was not a DC-Marvel-like movie, it would have gotten a five at best. Should work a bit harder next time though. For the time being, this was a big disappointment for me.",Suicide Squad
330,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,6,4 August 2016,"Me and Nicholas (The Autistic Reviewers) had been looking forward to this film all year. it was all over our facebook page and we had been nonstop talking about it. While Nicholas loved this film, here's my review of Suicide Squad: We all know the plot. A group of bad guys/crazy people are locked in Asylum. They have all been assigned to bring down the biggest threat yet: a witch destroying the city. Yeah, you heard correctly. Pretty stupid, right? While I did not care for the villain Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), I definitely liked a lot of the super hero/bad guys. Will Smith as Deadshot stole the show. He carried almost the whole film. His humor, his charm and his badass moves and shots were awesome. Jai Courtney as Boomerang was a great choice. He has several funny scenes. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was just great! She also stole the show. Her craziness and the fact that she has no fear was just pure genius! She was the first Harley Quinn to have ever been brought to life and she did a great job.The first half of the story is just introducing all of the characters one by one and their history. Problem is that it drags on and it gets old rather quickly, and it takes a while to get to the actual story. And by the time it gets to the end, you just don't care for Enchantress for a villain. At least, i didn't! I thought she was pointless and dull. They needed a better villain, or even better...a a better story.Now let's get to the main point: The Joker! Jared Leto was awesome. He does not imitate Nicholson or Ledger. He made his own Joker. He made the feel of it a little cartoony, but that's okay. Here's the problem: He only gets 13 mins and 39 secs of screen time (Yes, I timed it), and his background and his love for Harley Quinn is never explained. They just threw him in there real quickly with no background story, no reason for his love for Harley Quinn, no purpose and just not enough screen time. With Ledger and Nicholson's jokers, they were both properly explained and everything they did had a psychological reason as to why they had this idea/thought. There were posters all over the world of Leto's Joker and they really made out he was the main purpose of this film, but he wasn't. It's not a good way to introduce Jared Leto as the new joker by giving him 13 mins of screen time and with nothing to do. I really do hope Leto stays as the Joker, because his performance was great and he needs to be properly explained.All in all, Suicide Squad is worth watching, and if you jut bring your popcorn and drink it should be a good ride! 6/10 2.5/5 stars.",Suicide Squad
331,morganstephens512,"Honestly, it's really bad",2,18 October 2017,First for the good: I do like Will Smith's performance in this movie. That is something that was able to hold up. Everything else pretty much is awful. There is no character development. None of the characters have any good acting besides Smith. The plot is just flat out stupid and there was nothing really all that great about the plot of this movie at all. The special effects are bland and annoying and the whole thing just falls down and falls flat every single time. I just dislike this movie the more time that passes by.,Suicide Squad
332,danielharden,Seppuku Squad,6,10 August 2016,"Are you tired of those same old superhero movies? Do you want something a little bit different? Yes? So hows about instead of SuperHEROES we have SuperVILLAINS as our protagonists? That may or may not be how a meeting at Warner Brothers went down, but still the proposed idea of villains instead of heroes (helped a hell of a lot by the films fantastic marketing campaign) got millions of people pumped up and made this the film the most anticipated summer blockbuster of 2016... But with so much hype surrounding the film the likelihood of disappointment grows higher, and in this particular case, the film is very disappointing.I should probably start with what was good about this film, and I think if there is one positive thing we can all agree on, it's that the soundtrack was really good. There are songs from such great musicians like The Rolling Stones, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Queen, Eminem and Twenty One Pilots just to name a few (Don't even get me started on the number artists on Sucker For Pain). The films opening 10, 20 minutes is literally good song, after good song, after good song for like 5 or 6 songs straight. So regardless of the films quality the soundtrack for this should hopefully sell well.Another good thing about this film is what the actors do with their characters. Will Smith plays a Will Smith version of Deadshot, Margot Robbie is pretty brilliant as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto does a decent if brief portrayal as the Joker even if his presence is kinda irrelevant (Jared is nothing on Heath though). Although some actors spread there wings and fly with their characters, others are unfortunately never given the opportunity. Aside from those I've mentioned (and Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag I guess) everyone else is just there for the ride. Killer Croc, Captain Boomarang, Enchantress and Katana are given very little to do (Most notably Killer Croc who is probably one of the only character you knew about before this film happened). I'm not sure if its a case of tow-many-characters-spoil-the-broth but the focus in extremely disproportionate between the members of the squad.Suicide Squad suffers with some of the same problems as Batman v Superman, most notably the plot and its messy attempt at a unformulaic structure. The first 30 minutes or so simply introduces characters, but it only really introduces Deadshot and Harley and there isn't really much that is actually revealed about them other than Deadshot is the best hit-man ever and has a kid that is his world, and Harley was a doctor who treated and fell for the Joker and went batsh*t crazy. Also the mission they are on is unknown to us as well as the Squad, but you can kind of guess by putting two and two together which some will but some won't. So pretty much all you get for most of the film is thinly layered character introductions who are set on an unknown suicide mission. We knew more than this walking into the cinema screen. Oh I almost forgot about the oddly placed occasional flashback sequences like the Harley jumping into a toxic vat and making gross love with the Joker scene... They happen for some reason.This film is called Suicide SQUAD and yet the squad never at any point feels like a team. The film fails to form any kind of on screen bond/ chemistry with anyone (except Deadshot and Harley maybe). The film instead seems to have characters make dramatic shifts in their way of thinking for example; Diablo won't fight and get involved with the squad (albiet for a different reason other than not liking them) then suddenly they are his ""family"" and he, SPOILER ALERT, dies fighting for them. Another extreme out of character good to bad switch is evident in the scene where Amanda Waller leaves her control centre and joins the suicide squad on foot. This character has seemed rather fair thus far in the film... and then she guns down the entire control room, she may not have been all good but this seemed way to far of a leap to the dark side.Overall Suicide Squad suffers from a messy plot, thin character depth and a lot of underused characters, but at least the actors gave it their all and the soundtrack is dope. The DCEU is off to one hell of a rocky start that I, along with millions of others, must be thinking, the only way is up for batsy and his little band of misfits. Right?",Suicide Squad
333,patrickfilbeck,A masterpiece of trailer-lies,6,6 October 2021,"This movie isn't this ""one-of-the-worst-superhero-movies-ever"" kinda movie, but the trailers, especially the moody, dark first trailer, lied to the audience very harshly. This movie could've been a masterpiece, but the end results were mixed. Robbie as Quinn is one of the best actor choices in superhero-movies, her sexyness is well sought out, her talent can't be denied. Also Boomerangand Waller are portrayed very good and loveable/hooking, while other characters like The Enchantress are a waste of time and the result of a complete misunderstanding of the character. Then there are the mediovre ones, like Smith's Deadshot. The most shocking portrayal is the portrayal of the Joker and it definitly isn't the actor's failure. Leto gave passion, but the plot and the cuts stripped the character-moments of nearly all his potential. His portrayal as a crime boss, his sidekick and sidestory assets, and his visual presentation are an insult to this legendary villain. The story should'be been bulit around him as a villain. The Batman-moments were not neccessary and the storyline a hit and miss. The compilation of the team worked very well, while the encounters with the villain and the fightscenes were nearly all misses. How many choppers can fall down in amovie? Gosh...and the Joker survives them all...ridiculous. The end-scenes were again portrayed in very bad CGI. The Ayer Cut would be interesting to watch.",Suicide Squad

The Introduction to the Characters, the story, the containment in the City and that epic Ending with the Music and Deadshot, it was an Amazing watch.Things I liked About this Movie:° The Cool Artistic Introductions to Each of The Characters.° Will Smith, Margo Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman, Cara Delavigne (As Echantress) and Jared Leto were the 6 Characters in this film that I thought did a Good Job.° Deadshots' Gunplay scene was So Cool and the 'Terrorist' scene was very very good.° This Take on The Joker was SO Interesting, he was Like a Crime Boss version of The Joker, His Costumes, His Jewellery, His Mannerisms and His Overall design was So Good.° Incubus Looked Terrifying.° The Final Shot from Deadshot Was Great and Had suspense and Epic Music. 🎶° The Setting in Midway City felt Exciting.The Bad Stuff:° There was a certain Scene where you think, if he knew that was going to happen to him why the hell would be go down there and do that?° Some of the Other Characters were Forgettable but maybe that is what they intended.° Some Bad Dialogue at times.° I wanted to see more of The Joker.It's not a Perfect Movie but it has a totally Unique feel to it. It's another Production that is of its own kind.Overall, For Me, The 3 Greatest DC Movies are Aquaman, Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad. This is Definitely one of DC'S Greatest they have ever made in my eyes. A Unique Production.",Suicide Squad
335,thepriceofpayne,It's Okay,5,14 April 2018,"While Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis give fun and very charismatic performances, in fact I'd say most of the cast does. The unimaginative screenplay and bad visual effects turn what could've been a fun Guardians of the Galaxy esque Film into a bland forgettable mess that has too many ideas going into it.",Suicide Squad
336,EasternZZ,An Unwatchable movie,2,24 September 2018,"This movie is unwatchable. The plot is completely senseless, the action is more boring than the 2005 Fantastic Four movie, misleading trailer, terrible final act (the entire movie is already bad), a waste of Will Smith (he is too good for this movie), non-stop usage of popular songs, and probably the worst version of the Joker ever seen.The story is about this lady who wants to create a special team to fight off bad guys, so she assembles some bad criminals and send them into this deserted city to fight a bunch of nameless creatures and save the city, while she secretly has something up her sleeves. The first thing wrong with this is that half of the ""Suicide Squad"" are completely useless and shouldn't even have been a choice to fight this ancient evil. Harley Quinn, Boomerang, & Slipknot are completely useless and have no special abilities at all (Slipknot does nothing in this movie). Harley fights with a bat, and Boomerang throws boomerangs. They could have used special soldiers instead. Harley poses no threat at all, Boomerang is big but useless, and Slipknot may have a special ability but he does nothing at all because he is just in this movie to show the audience ""Hey, this is what happens when you don't obey orders."" Seriously, the actor playing Slipknot should be angry that he was dressed up, all hyped only to do absolutely nothing in this movie.The action is bad. There is not a single action scene that even gets you excited or whatever. Batman V Superman had way better action. In that movie we got some cool Batman car battle scenes, Batman and Superman fighting, Batman fighting thugs in a warehouse, and the final battle. The best action scene in this movie is the scene where the Suicide Squad is ambushed and Will Smith climbs on a car and shoots them. It is cool but still completely pales when compared to BvS. The final battle is also very bad, with the Suicide Squad suddenly out of nowhere telling each other that they are family and that they will defeat this evil, without ever giving us a sense that they even know each other. There is zero development in this movie. They spend a lot of time just walking down an empty street, talking without any context. For no reason at all, they go into a bar and start drinking, then Harley suddenly becomes sentimental and berates one of the Suicide Squad for doing something bad, while she and everyone else does bad stuff too. Lastly, nothing against Jared Leto. He has two songs I like. His performance in this movie is a complete fail. He is just channeling Health Ledger, even though he said he won't. He licks his lips when talking just like Ledger, he talks just like Ledger, and he make these head movements just like Ledger. He is a Mexican gangster in this movie, with gangster tattoos, and he has no point in this movie. He has one really cool scene with him and Harley Quinn bleaching their skins, but besides that, this is the worst Joker of all time. His scenes are just flashbacks that happens during certain points in the movie when Harley Quinn begins to think about him, that is all. David Ayer is a great director, but for some reason this movie just completely fails. This is one of those movies that I would put on my ""Unwatchable List."" So far the list contains such movies as Transformers 2,and Moebius (2013).",Suicide Squad
337,hjalsayegh,My little pony: friendship is magic,4,11 August 2016,"Saying this movie lost the plot would be inaccurate as it did NOT have a plot to begin with!The first hour is spent introducing the main characters as stand alone criminals that are now locked up in solitary.So half the movie, half the movie is just telling you that your ""heroes"" are the bad guys, they don't play well with others, they're only looking out for number one AND that they've had little to no contact with each other.Then they're in a team to defeat the villain that aims to... to... I think it was rule the world or destroy it, it was never made clear what the villain's aim was or how they would do it. it was just bad guy, that's their location, go!You know what, the avengers was a group of heroes with a common goal and even they had growing pains forming a team. the interactions made that movie. Here they pulled a my little pony friendship is magic stunt (not kidding regarding the pony, they actually throw a pink one at you in slow motion!) so the previous hour was wasted... the team is well coordinated and the members are willing to die for each other... the selfish criminals, who've only known each other for less then a day... and Kitana is somehow with them to for no reason what so ever, she just joined them!I really wanted to love this movie, Harley Quinn is my fav. DC character and Will Smith (playing Deadshot) is just so charming... and you love both in this movie but...The visuals are amazing though sometimes they make no sense, the character design is eye catching and the effects are nice.however plot wise they pretty much threw a few DC characters into a blender and hit the on the button hoping for hit.Overall it's a poor movie BUT still enjoyable because of the stand alone characters. I would recommend renting it if only for the dialogue.",Suicide Squad

Short 20 second clips that offer a nugget of not a great deal before bouncing on to something else.Like the film had been constructed ready made to cherry pick a trailer from but unfortunately they chose literally all the best bits for the trailer hence there was nothing new for the film.The Harley scene with the lift was a classic example of this. Utterly pointless, meaningless fight, chance to play another 'cool' track and then walks out with everyone giving her the clichéd amazed look.I really wanted to give the film a chance but it was so uninvolving and the characters so unengaging. They weren't written with any verve or intelligence, just the barest most generic collection that you could of.None of them were really bad (as in being labelled the worst of the worst), just a little naughty.The fights felt empty and nothing more than a darkened jumble of motion, loud crashes and whatever piece of music they had commissioned and rammed in to make it all feel really cool.And as for the ending, we had the usual swirly lights and overwhelming destructive power that can amazingly be destroyed with a few well placed grenades.I can't believe I'm saying it but I think B vs S held my attention more and that was shocking.Utterly woeful effort.",Suicide Squad

341,tinovalkki,Simply too many characters,4,16 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is DC comics counterpart to Marvel universe. Unfortunately bad one. Movie tries to bring record amount of meta humans to one movie and that is it's biggest problem. There are simply too many characters to one movie. It has no time enough to concentrate any of it characters enough Even movie have great rock classics from Queen to Black Sabbath on it's soundtrack won' make any difference. Too much is simply too much. Best part of the movie are Jared Leto's Joker and his girlfriend Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). You almost hope that hole movie were focused on these two characters instead of what it tries to do. Suicide Squad also attempt to make DC comics movies darker and more violent movies than Marvel movies are. By doing that they ignorance bigger audience to close out of the audience younger peoples who normally are bigger audience for comic book too. Only Deadpool has succeed on that, but it was clearly targeted to more mature audience than this one. 3D on the movie feels just vain. They don't use it in any camera or cinematic effects at all. It just feels that they wanted to get that 3D added to movies name. If DC comics tries to compete to Marvel movies in any measures in the future they should focus more on story and characters than try to make their movie unnecessary noisy and violent. Suicide Squad is, unfortunately one of the worst comic book movies ever. Too bad.",Suicide Squad
342,TheMovieDoctorful,Visually Unforgettable With A Big Heart,10,12 December 2018,"For better or worse, Suicide Squad is best watched as a sort of visual exhibition made by comic book-inspired artists. Much of what comic books such an intriguing and compelling form of narrative is their subtle and creative use of visuals to create theme, atmosphere and character, yet so many modern comic book films get hung up on telling us these details purely through words. For whatever else you can accuse Suicide Squad of, it gets this. From a purely aesthetic standpoint, this is perhaps the most interesting comic book film I've seen since Persepolis.The plot is nothing special, admittedly full of holes and often contrived, but I was ultimately able to dismiss this based on 1) The underwhelming stories of most franchise-set comic book films 2) The inventive ways Suicide Squad handles its visuals and characters and 3) The acting performances. Director David Ayer looks at how diverse his characters are in background, personality and abilities and uses this to blend all sorts of visual styles to pull us into this grandiose, trippy, but ultimately toxic and frightening, nightmare world that these colorful villains experience every day. Deadshot brings a more slick and clean early 2000s spy thriller aesthetic to his scenes, Enchantress heavy sequences feel reminiscent of a Renaissance artist, Diablo's moments are reflective of Aztec codex paintings. Even the much maligned Joker & Harley Quinn bring an art style straight out of West Coast tattoo culture. What Ayer does in allowing all these major players in his ensemble cast to bring their own unique artistic fashion to the film is, as far as I know, unprecedented in this genre. Furthermore, all of these visual styles are implemented beautifully. What Suicide Squad has that so many comic book films of today lack is atmosphere and personality. Suicide Squad has that in spades. Harley Quinn's birth at Ace Chemicals remains to this day the most visually striking and aesthetically gorgeous scene I've witnessed in a comic book film, feeling straight off the page of one of the best DC Comics artists. The visuals go far in making this film feel like a ""comic book brought to life"" and each of these styles does a wonderful job visually telling us more about these characters.On that note, thank God we finally have a superhero team up movie where the screenwriter didn't feel compelled to have all of the characters hate each other for the dumbest reasons imaginable for the entire film up until the last 10 minutes. The Squad members here have genuine chemistry in a kind of ""honor among thieves"" sort of way, their experience out in the Hellish streets for which they've earned their notoriety has taught them the necessity of ""bond to survive."" (Also, as much as people want to harp on Harley Quinn becoming instant friends with Deadshot, this is hardly out of character. In Batman: The Animated Series, she makes instant buddies with her kidnapping victim. Being unexpectedly friendly to strangers who pose no threat to her, despite her chaotic and violent nature, has always been part of her charm.) It's an excellent subversion of expectations regarding how common audience members may expect these characters to react. Furthermore, it brings more weight and substance to Rick Flagg's character arc; how he begins the film with a very black & white view of morality, but begins to recognize the gray areas upon witnessing both the Squad's camaraderie and their eventual heroism and capacity for good.Margot Robbie's acting performance as Harley Quinn is my favorite I've seen in any superhero film to date. She entirely feels like her antiheroine counterpart jumped straight off the pages of her literary source material. Her balance of sickly, sweet friendliness and unpredictable, manic insanity is perfection and she shows incredible emotional range here in both her facial acting and vocal delivery in an unbelievably transformative role for Robbie. Her scene at the bar scolding Diablo comes from such a place of emotional passion and energy, Robbie IS the Clown Queen of Crime as far as I'm concerned.Viola Davis is an absolute force as Amanda Waller. She commands such power and such presence in every scene she's in that I had no problem believing this is the kind of person that could put A-list metas in line with nothing more than a hardened stare. As with Robbie's Harley Quinn, I can't think of a better and more commanding actress for the role.While Jared Leto's Joker certainly didn't set the world on fire, I really enjoyed him. Leto works quite well as a more seductive take on The Joker, a Joker more representative of the appeal to the dark side of life that Harley finds so intoxicating. Even the romanticization of their relationship isn't nearly as awful as it's made out to be when you consider that almost all of Harley & Joker's interactions are told from the perspective of bias; Harley's skewed memories. It makes sense she would remember the good more than the bad.Many critics have called the film thematically shallow and I would strongly disagree with this assertion. The themes of unconditional love and sacrifice are quite strong here in the journeys of Deadshot, Harley, Diablo and Flagg. These are characters who very much start the film quite self absorbed, but who must learn the value of sacrifice through the bonds they form amongst each other. To, if only for one day, become the heroes they could have been in a fairer world. To become worthy of both the love of others and the love of self. As much of a mess as the plot is, it's an emotionally resonant and thought provoking message that's well conveyed with its main cast.The insane critical backlash for this film, while not depressing, is certainly frustrating. The performances are great, the characters are likable and have great chemistry and the visuals, and their usage, are unforgettable. This is comic book euphoria.",Suicide Squad
343,Solnichka,Entertaining and good ... why all the negativity?,9,16 August 2016,"I liked it. I know little to nothing about comic books, and I didn't see the last DC Comics film (Batman vs Superman or whatever), but the Wonder Woman film upcoming looks good. And, of course, I grew up watching the Superfriends in cartoon form back when in the 1970s.Anyway ... I liked the structure of the film, and it was entertaining without being over-the-top lame like some of the Ironman and Avengers films. I like Captain America and Thor movies, but anything with Ironman in it makes me gag. I am not partial to either comic canon; I just want to be entertained.And I was. Margot Robbie and Will Smith were good; Cara Delevingne or whatever her name is was pretty good, too. Clint Eastwood's kid? No. He sucks. And Ben Affleck still has no talent.There were only 10 other people in the matinée I saw today, and eight of them left before the mid-credits scene that is now a staple for these movies. It sets up the Justice League movie, I assume.Not sure why critics ripped this movie, nor do I care, because I have no stake in it either way.

It also gives us a Joker portrayed by a method actor who knows how to internalize a character, but not how to project the character (the latter being why Ledger was so great). Leto's Joker is just as lame, unbelievable, and indescribably annoying as Eisenberg's Lex Luthor. 
Rather than picking the thing apart, perhaps it is best said that WB/DC should simply pretend that this movie never happened, then recast the Joker before The Batman is made. I wish they would to the same with Luthor. (Why is it that Marvel can do such a good job but DC can't? It's because Marvel knows how to cut through the Hollywood BS and hire the right people and DC doesn't.)",Suicide Squad

I went to theater with least expectations as I was not hyped by its trailers but wanted to see because it was a part of DCCU. Seriously BvS trailer was much better than SS's trailers.BvS 3 hr ultimate edition was good than theatrical version anyway I will talk about SS. Critics have this movie a big THUMBS DOWN👎 as they did to BvS but it was good.Unlike BvS WB injected some comedy in this movie and that's what pretty interesting plus the acting of Margot Robbie and Will Smith added a blast in this one. Rest of the cast was good. Ben Affleck's dark knight special appearance was very good as I liked him in BvS.Visuals and Graphics and Fight Scenes were good. Story was not as gripping as it would have been but that's OK it's usual with Superhero Movies. At least BvS (3 hr version) and this one doesn't let me down and i can look forward to WW and JL. I don't know why WB's movies are being compared with Marvel's as both's tones are different. I mean you know WB has its own flavor. But WB has still have to work hard in comparison to Marvel but that's OK it will do.Overall the movie was good and i am recommending you pls don't go with high expectations. It is strictly my personal opinion other depends upon you guys.My rating 7.2/10 (enjoyable yet forgettable).,Suicide Squad

The entertainment value just in the character flashback stories made excellent use of film and was very interesting to watch. The problem comes in the story beyond that, like what the main plot of the film was. I felt that the main story and plot was weak and underwhelming and I lost some interest about halfway into it. The movie was a bit of a let down in that regard and the main story, at least for me wasn't clear for me. Because of all of that, the poor storyline on the main plot and the underwhelming overall progression just made his movie very average.An entertaining way to spend a few hours, probably worth the money to go and see.",Suicide Squad

Now here are some things you should probably know, the acting in this movie was awesome, everything else however was awful. Now here's what seems to have happen. They shot something like 4 hours worth of footage, combined it was possibly one of the best versions of suicide squad that could have been made. Now here's what happen after that, the director cut that movie to shreds, but it doesn't stop there, he actually rearranged the cut parts of the movie to make it seem like a completely different movie then was shot. So now you have a terrible movie that was once a good movie that is now a clutter of moments out of order that seems like absolute chaos. If you're wondering why I'm giving this movie a 5/10 it's because the acting was THAT good. They can very easily save this movie from itself, just release the directors cut on DVD, the full 4 hours, and pray that everyone forgets about the stitched together abomination of a movie you attempted to show in theaters.",Suicide Squad
351,barbagvido,"Ignore the critics. If you're interested at least one bit, go see it You won't regret it.",8,5 August 2016,"My expectations were very high and this was my most anticipated movie of the year. I've been waiting for it for more than a year. And now it's finally here. And it was well worth the wait.Some critics call it worse than Green Lantern and last year's Fantastic Four. Well, that's where critics become haters because any person who says that is crazier than Harley Quinn. This movie ISN'T that bad. In fact, if you're a fan, you will love it. If you don't know much about the source material or DC Comics in general, the least you will think is that it was fun. Think Guardians of the Galaxy, DC version. Without space or aliens. And it's got an awesome soundtrack too. The critics say both that the plot is thin and that it's overstuffed. Just there you can see that they are just nitpicking. I'll be honest, the plot IS thin, but like the plot of The Avengers isn't. And yet, no one mentioned that. And it's still a good movie (to me not as good as everyone says, but okay). And this is even better. At least it is to me. It kinda depends if you like DC or Marvel more. But still, if you prefer Marvel, you will think this was at the very least entertaining. There were clearly some disagreements between the director and the studio because the studio wanted a more light-hearted and funnier movie, while Ayer wanted it to be darker and it isn't very well balanced and that's the reason why the movie feels choppy at times. The first half is full of dark humor and while there is some over- exposition, it sets up the characters very well. The second half is a bit more serious, but that was necessary to add some more emotional weight to everything. Maybe it does seem gloomy at times (I was, honestly, never bothered by that because that's what DC is and I don't see why everyone has a problem with that), but even tho I liked Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, I will admit and say that this movie has something those two movies didn't have. The appeal. And the main reason for that is the best thing about the movie:the characters. They are well written (a few of them are kinda paper thin, let's take Killer Croc for example) and every actor nailed the role he or she played. And by the way, don't expect to see much of The Joker. Leto killed it and he captivates every time he's on screen, but he's on screen for probably 10 minutes in total. But even tho everyone was great in their roles, the biggest star of the movie is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. I just couldn't write this review without mentioning her. I can't wait to see more of her and Leto. And also Jai Courtney as Captain Boomeramg nailed it. If you didn't like him before, you will still like him here, trust me. Also, if you were worried about the PG-13 rating, stop worrying. When you see the movie, you will see that it didn't even need an R rating. R rating would probably just make it look kinda pretentious.Basically, if you're interested, go see it and ignore the critics. This is the best DCEU movie yet and if you're a fan, it's guaranteed that you'll love it!",Suicide Squad
352,stonedraim,Is this a suicide concerning creativity? Or a squad beneath acting?,5,20 August 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Inflation. Inflation. Heard of it? That's when something is losing it's value and there is something too much out there to be appreciated. The first word comes to my mind in here... inflation. Building the story up, starting it out just laying it out there... trying to be ""just so cool and, man, so awesome"" with something serious over the top happening (with authorities, police officers, the government and something like that) and delivering it with some 70-80's music in the background and just so ""cool"" and smart dialogue (...hear it, man? Yo!), to give it the weird and twisted touch. Grasping to be ""awesome in the cool-ness"". Just watch the opening scenes. Well... inflation.Just seen ""Stranger Things"" and...wow, here he is again; David Harbour! Let's see if he delivers in the same way as in the stranger areas (pun? No...really?!)The Joker must have listened too much to Marilyn Manson. Sweet dreams are made of...? Well. Insanity, making the Joker looking like the rock star. And how...by the love of...by the love of...by the love of Robocop, how can Joel Kinnaman get these super roles in movies? Yes, he is a Swede, so am I. We are country men. Even so, I would strongly advice him to read the book by such of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino for better knowledge about acting. I will go that far to even recommend the book of Sylvester Stallone (he got the nomination long time ago) and Arnold Schwarzenegger; they are way better actors than Mr. Kinnaman. He is often so bad that I can feel the directing through the screen. Where is the heart and soul of the characters? Gone. Joel Kinnaman made this production cave in. Just when the other actors have made it almost great a couple of minutes, in comes Mr. Kinnaman and... the house of cards is left in ruins.Inflation nr. 2: explosions, devastation, guns, bombs, ancient forces, ""alien-like- enemies""... is it really that hard to write something more subtle and innovative? Or is the money right now in these kind of movies?Do you like super hero movies and all the new X-Men? Then I can almost recommend ""Suicide Squad"" as entertainment.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Kind of a modern film noir here and there. Twisted, crazy, weird and solid. - The actors : Did I mention Joel Kinnaman? (Otherwise, I have to say that Jared Leto created his own version of a modern new age Joker, and delivered... yeah, he actually delivered.) - Entertainment : Worth the watch. David Ayer got little water over his head here, both writing and directing. Too bad. - Age : 154,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 5 Approved. 4 Failed. Lacking in character.)",Suicide Squad

Saying you're good in critics is even more idiotic than saying to not watch this movie.
I'm glad I watched this movie, so I didn't miss the opportunity of having some fun and I enjoyed almost everything. I'm a person who tries to find something good in what the others think that it's only bad. I know you don't have any idea about the meaning of the Tao sign, Yin and Yang... I'll be trying to explain you something even if I know you won't be able to understand... a big black part with a small white ball means that even if you can think that everything is bad, there's always something good, sometimes very tiny, but the other big part is white with a small black ball and the meaning is that even if apparently everything is good, there's something bad and you have to choose what to do... in your case, you decided to look just at the big black part and you didn't see that small white ball, because you're full of hate and anger. I watched the big white part conscious that not everything is good and I enjoyed the movie, you just hated everything and you didn't understand that in the end you were the only who felt bad... after reading the word end, you were furious, angry and probably you started complaining for everything... poor guys, I'm really sorry for you.For the other people... I'm not saying that it's a fantastic movie, but it's worth of being watched if you like the genre, of course.

354,paulijcalderon,A weird but fun movie,6,6 August 2016,"A decent action film. The first act felt like a mix of a Guy Ritchie heist film blended together with some dark humor. The rest of the film reminded me of ""Escape from New York"". Anti heroes forced to do a mission in a desolated city with a time limit. It is a weird movie at times. But, I understand why. The characters are weird themselves, so the film should have us seeing their world view. That being said, there are still a lot of tonal differences in this movie which could put you off very easily.Right from the start you see that this is going to be a different entry in the DC universe. Once you get what style its going for then it's more easy to have fun with it. The atmosphere of the prison setting is great and the introduction of the characters was fun and makes you understand most of them.Will Smith was the best he has been for years. Margot Robbie as Harley was just like seeing the character leap out from comics and cartoons. Killer Croc played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was a good addition, great that they used a practical suit. Joel Kinnaman was also very good as the guy who must keep the squad together. He also showed a lot of emotion. Actually all the actors did a great job. Must of the time you forget who is playing them and just see the characters, which is a good thing. All of them have a humanity about them despite the insanity that they inhabit. Jay Hernandez as Diablo surprised me with his a tragic background. Jai Courtney gave probably his best performance he has given. Jared Leto was actually very interesting as the Joker. I like the way he is portrayed as a gang leader and he has a unpredictability about him which makes the character unsettling on screen. He isn't in it enough to be judged properly though.Those are the things I like about the movie. Now for what I thought could be better. I think the villain was too convenient and I little too over the top at times. I think the squad should have gone out for some other mission and then during the mission you could have a twist and make them fight something supernatural like the Enchantress. But the idea of the Enchantress starting to do her evil plan just at the same time the squad is assembled felt like a weird coincidence. And I thought that the light beam to the sky was uninteresting and already used in way too many comic book films. The action scenes could have had better variations, the seemed to repeat themselves.Since the DC films are trying to catch up to Marvel it seems they add too much story in each film. The flashbacks were needed to set everyone up, but they felt short and choppy. I could feel that a lot of it was cut out. But, the film would have benefited with the flashbacks being longer, because the origin stories of these guys are interesting. Since the need to cram all of these things into one film it felt like they tried to tell the stories of another film all together.All in all, the film was decent and entertaining. A bit bloated and better threats and action set pieces would have made it better. The bar scene was probably my favorite scene in the movie. It was a nice character moment and felt focused. I think they at DC are starting to learn how to make these films better now. Well, I hope so at least. It wasn't fantastic, but fun and entertaining.",Suicide Squad
355,DanLives1980,Still better than Fant4stic lol,6,21 October 2016,"In five or ten years the next generation will no doubt appreciate this much more than we did, although I'm not dismissing it. Suicide Squad has plenty enjoyable qualities and enough to keep your attention. It's not a terrible film as long as you're not a film connoisseur or a comic book fan. For the most part it enjoys a superb production, albeit inconsistent at times. Saying that, I've never met a fan of the source material; not even over the great expanse of the Internet!A rarity these days is that I managed to watch the movie from beginning to end, whilst paying attention. Saying that, I've done the same with Punisher War Zone and Freddy Got Fingered. I have a high threshold for good trash. I have a low threshold for vapid, soulless trash. They made some pretty uninteresting characters work for the screen, but desperately diminished others, such as Harley Quinn in regard to her notorious qualities and back story; no doubt to handle the audience with kid gloves.Will Smith's character is possibly the strongest in the whole film, even though his Deadshot is also light on authenticity. But he works at it while the likes of Killer Croc just snarls and skulks and Katana just serves as a token Asian with a fancy sword.Jay Hernandez's El Diablo is the underdog for me in terms of redemption and likability and Cara Delavigne does a great job switching character, but is given little else to do other than look impressive. Joel Kinnaman is wooden at times, as always, but has come a long way.But Jared Leto's Joker? I went in without expectation. I came out with ""Feminist Trans 4Chan Toad doing a Scarface impression whilst sounding very much like Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow after dental surgery..."" He is horrendous but girls will like him anyway, because, ""Jared Leto!""Scott Eastwood and Adam Beach are also massively wasted, and I'd feel sorry for Jai Courtenay, but he chose to audition for a character called Captain Boomerang so exactly what was he expecting to have to work with? Dumb dialogue? Poor humour and action? Check!Otherwise it's full of spectacle that looks good for the most part and it creates a tone I'd expect of a movie based around comic villains, minus the romanticised Joker/Harley thread which I feel was the weakest link. But if this was the version the studio wanted me to see, I want to see Ayer's Director's Cut.Damn it, DC, have some faith in your audience. I'm a Marvel fan and I'm still rooting for you!",Suicide Squad
356,tkarlmann,Is it Possible NOT to fall for Margot Robbie?,9,2 December 2019,"I watched an animated version of this film, but still, kinda knowing what was going to happen, I still was completely taken in with the entire movie! I think Magrot Robbies' 'Harley Quinn' character absolutely makes this movie! In the midst of all these really tough bad guys & soldiers, here trots lovable, curvy, scantily-clad Harley Quinn snapping, quibbling and flirting about everything while still managing to be The Joker's girlfriend, definitely does her share of the fighting, NEVER losing her femininity, and cute as all get-out the entire time; while also managing to be the one who gets the ultimate villain in the end! Oh, did I mention, all while strutting around in a completely outlandishly skimpy costume, and bending over constantly? The ONLY compromise made for her was she carried a baseball bat in this movie instead of her typical large wooden hammer. I really had a crush her for the entire movie -- and I'm an older guy!!!",Suicide Squad
357,rcolgan,"They're the bad guys. Well, kind of bad",4,12 August 2016,"On paper Suicide Squad seemed like it should have been DC's golden child. It had a stellar cast that included Oscar winner Jarred Leto and rising star Margot Robbie, it was being helmed by director David Ayer who's written great villainous leads in the past such as Alonzo Harris in Training Day and the trailers made it look like we were going to get everything that we'd want from a Suicide Squad movie. But somewhere along the line all this potential got wasted and Suicide Squad has ended up being the biggest misfire from DC Entertainment since Green Lantern. The Suicide Squad is based around a group of dangerous meta-humans put together by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) and led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). This team includes the most deadly shooter in the world Deadshot (Will Smith), the Jokers girlfriend Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), an Australian thief called Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), a fire conjurer called El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), a human reptile called Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and a woman with a sword capable of trapping the souls of its victims named Katana (Karen Kukuhara). Unfortunately the film seems to glaze through all the character introductions as quickly as I've done in the last paragraph, with Viola Davis presenting each of the characters in the beginning as if she were reading off the background summaries from trading cards. Even Harley Quinn, who has one of the darkest and most interesting backstories of how she entered an abusive relationship with the Joker, has her history summed up in a very brief two minute flashback. Although she still gets more time to be introduced than most, with some characters just showing up out of nowhere to join the team without any explanation whatsoever. In spite of the core concept of the suicide squad being that they're a task force of dangerous villains, the film makes every member of the squad seem like very noble characters. Whilst the film constantly reminds us that they're ""the bad guys"", there never seems to be much to differentiate the Suicide Squad from any other superhero team. At one point there's nothing stopping some members of the Squad from simply leaving, but they still stay for no other reason than to save the day. Their characterisation is similar to the crew from the Fast and Furious films. Sure they're criminals, but at the end of the day we're supposed to root for them since they're still going to do the right thing. They just complain more whilst they do it. Though the films saving grace is that it does have some great performances. Will Smith brings back the charm and quick wit that made him a star in films like Independence Day and Men in Black. Margot Robbie gives Harley Quinn a great live action cinematic debut with an unpredictable, chaotic nature that feels partly like the Joker and partly like the wife from the Honeymooners. Viola Davies brings a level of cold heartedness and brutality to Amanda Waller in a performance that is probably the most loyal to the comics of any character in the film. The film also boosts a charismatic and loud mouthed performance from Jai Courtney and a surprisingly heartfelt performance by Jay Harnandez, whose fire blasting antihero ends up getting the best story arc of the entire film. These performances are so good that most of the films best moments are when the film has the characters personalities bounce off one another, like Captain Boomerang teasing other members or Deadshot annoying El Diablo to get him to burn out a room full of enemies. The best scene in the film ends up just being when the squad stops to get some drinks in the bar and just start talking to each other. It's just a shame that Jared Leto, one of the films strongest cast members, doesn't even get an opportunity to interact with any members of the Suicide Squad other than Harley Quinn. In fact, in spite of Leto's prominent billing in marketing he hardly gets any screen time throughout the entire film. He was great in the short time he got, giving the Joker a young, brutal, mob boss style, so I'm looking forward to seeing him in future DC films. But his talents do not get the chance to shine here. Supposedly there was a lot cut from the film, including a lot more of the Joker and several cool trailer moments that don't end up appearing in the final film. So just like Dawn of Justice: Ultimate Edition there is probably a better version of the Suicide Squad sitting on a cutting room floor somewhere. But unless that gets released I'd advise just checking out the animated movie Batman: Assault on Arkham. It's does far better justice to the Suicide Squad characters and is everything that this film should have been.",Suicide Squad
358,KeremUlucay,DISAPPOINTMENT,5,26 November 2018,"This is one of the worse superhero movies in 21st century. Movie cant decide its mood. It tries to be funny, sometimes serious and even sometimes dramatic. But it is nothing. A story like that goes slow everytime, cant believe this. Even in action scenes. But basicly, this project had a big potential. It is a great comic book event, has a awesome fiction, a diffrent Joker after Heath, a great Harley Quinn, big stars like Will Smith, colourful and diffrent characters... Movie's villian is worst part of it for me. My favourites about this film are musics, Batman's scenes and final scene. Because there are Batman and Joker, you know.

The film is not bad but considering the amout of big names and characters that are involved in suicide squad you would expect it to be much MUCH better. The plot is basic and very thin although there is some great action scenes the film lacks excitement, margot robbie (harley quinn) is superb and one of the highlights of the film, the joker (jared leto) was good but not great and will smith as deadshot was brilliant. The good was some of the cast and the bad was the plot and story, but watching this film does do 1 thing and that's make you appreciate batman vs superman film.If DC don't sort out the next phase of films they will be in a lot of trouble as the first 2 were films that got people excited and both fell short, suicide squad is worth watching with a run time of 110 mins its not too long but i would not go out of your way to watch it.",Suicide Squad

364,Harhaluulo54,It didn't annoy me,5,9 October 2016,"I kind of wish I had seen this when I was still 14. I used to like the movie 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' (2003) back in the days, and 'Suicide Squad' (2016) reminded me of how much better action movies were when I still had low standards on awesome. Suicide Squad is clearly a kids movie aimed for kids. Should it be rated and reviewed as such? Not everyone who sees this is a child nor will they view it as a kids movie, so I guess it is not relevant. I would like to compare this to movies that weren't so clearly kids movies, though.Suicide Squad was a smarter move than the new 'X-Men: Apocalypse' (2016). It was better written and more mature than 'Man of Steel' (2013). It surpasses even Marvel movies, such as 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2016) and is better than any Captain America movie ever made. Including the new 2016 movie. Suicide Squad suffers from several problems. Which all can be referred to with the word 'bad'. Bad writing, bad directing, bad pacing, bad characters and an OST which is a total mess of meme songs everyone has heard billion times before. Every superhero movie seems to suffer similar problems more or less. The main difference being that some have flaws, superpowers and characters more annoying than others. Suicide Squad is a very mild take on everything. It doesn't have strong moralities or pseudo-deep reasoning, tragic past-stories, terrible parents nor villains who are so evil they have to go and kick puppies in their free time. It didn't try to be good, and that is definitely something superhero movies generally lack as they are never really good, but still try so hard to be. And that's why Suicide Squad is better -or at least less annoying- than most superhero movies.",Suicide Squad
365,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 78,8,9 August 2016,"My first thought when going to see this movie was, ""It's not rated 'R'??"" It's such a dark and macabre film. A superhero movie to change all the rules of superhero movies. And while it almost does, it's difficult to do so when you go for a PG-13 rating. Although, I understand why. Widening your audience means more butts in the seats. And those who would want it to be rated R will probably still think it's rated R.After the death of Superman, US intelligence agent, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), wants to put together a team of criminals to go on dangerous missions at no risk, since they're seen as expendable.Of the ensemble cast, the bigger names consist of Will Smith as the hit man, Deadshot, Margot Robbie as The Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn, and Jared Leto as The Joker, himself.I'd like to preface this all by saying I enjoyed the film. It's not terrible. I'd watch it again, and probably even buy it on DVD. It does a lot of things right, but it's not without its fair share of hiccups.You can't help but notice that the DC cinematic universe is always playing catch-up to the Marvel one. And it doesn't have to. This was its chance to do something totally different. And in some ways it does--or at least, sets itself up to in the future. But the random interjections of jokes amidst action scenes don't feel fluid, but forced. DC is supposed to be much darker and less tongue-in-cheek. Less quippy.DC, in some sense, has far more interesting and unique characters--especially villains--than Marvel. They've grown to be more twisted over the years, and this film tries to use that to its advantage, but it just doesn't always work.That's not to say it never does. This year's Batman v Superman film uses cheesy filters to make it feel dark. In Suicide Squad it's more convincing. It's dark. Really dark. But you can't help feel like the film is torn between sinister and cartoony. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy succeeds at this perfectly. But Suicide Squad is trying to be both Dark Knight and Avengers at the same time. I'm not so sure that's possible.It could have benefited from being more serious. The film starts out comfortably fitting into its own universe, but the random bits of levity are often jarring, making it seem like the film is trying to be as appealing to its more popular contemporary. Yet, it never has to. The material is great on its own. And we won't blame writer-director David Ayer, because apparently, it was the studio who demanded there be more humor scattered throughout.This is what Marvel does very well. In the Avengers films, entire scenes don't come to a grinding halt whenever Iron Man says something funny. The humor blends into the action. It doesn't combat it. Here, the action scenes were the only times the film was free of jokes.And we don't mind levity. However, in this scenario, the jokes should have been darker--not cuter. But with Robbie delivering them, that's what you get.They seem to want her to be the focal point of the laughs, but I just wanted her to stop. You don't always buy in to her jokes, and she just ends up getting annoying. Smith, however, is the unsung comedic talent of the film. His timing is as good as ever and it never feels forced--fitting into the Marvel vibe they're going for.Leto as The Joker was perfect because he wasn't overexposed. Every time we see him, he's gone moments later, making us want more. Robbie is in almost the entire film. You're supposed to love her antihero, but you never really do. Not enough is given to us. We end up just feeling indifferent.There's a scene towards the beginning of the film where Davis' character is sitting down at a table, explaining one-by-one the backstory of each character. it takes about 10 minutes and freezes any plot progression that's going on. The normal version of me would have hated this in any other situation, but it may be the best part of this movie. We're being introduced to these interesting, complex, deranged characters. We get get excited about what's to come. The filmmakers want us to fall in love with these antiheroes, but this is the only time it truly lets us.Despite the lack of action sequences, the pacing's fairly good, and the film is entertaining everywhere else. However, it has a long way to go to be considered great.I really want these new DC films to be of the best quality, but I fear that they can't. Not as long as they're too preoccupied with trying to be Marvel. Honestly, if I never saw another Marvel film again, I wouldn't be devastated. It's time for something new, and DC can give us that. They almost had it here.Twizard Rating: 78",Suicide Squad
366,Equalizer16,Fun not great,6,13 August 2016,"The anticipated Suicide Squad is in cinemas and is okay. Following the events of Dawn of Justice, Amanda Waller assembles a team of villains to work together to stop a supernatural threat. Directed by David Ayer (not Snyder) the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) continues to grow by introducing the DC equivalent of Guardians of the Galaxy (the only difference being that Guardians of the Galaxy is a masterpiece). The Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith) Haley Quinn (Margot Robbie) Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and some other character shoe horned inn, also the Joker Played by Jared Leto.So what is expected of the film on one hand is provided, as kick ass, cool, and loud action to make a real fun cinema experience. On the other hand what was also expected was an awesome strong film with consistency, but this is not quite the same film I saw in the trailers.So what happens to the film is a rushed pace, that goes wonky at the end, with some layered characters next to some very un-layered characters in a narrative with not much consistent direction. What holds the film together is Margot Robbie's performance which really carries everything with her pure insanity. Although Will Smith plays a pretty cool Deadshot, all I see is Smith being the same as he always is in every other film. So what should be a Squad becomes a duo as these two are the only real characters in the whole film. Which brings us to Jared Leto. We all know that no actor could beat the great Heath Ledger when it comes to playing the Joker, and Leto holds no candle at all, by providing a gangster Joker which no one asked for. What Leto does nail is the scary intimidation of the Joker, but struggles to be the Joker we all know and love.What is also a vital part to the film is the action sequences, which are enjoyable at first but end up getting more dramatic. This is also supported by a very strong use of CGI which pretty much invades the whole film. The film also provides entertainment with its humour which we were hoping to quite consistent, but it appears every line has to be delivered by Robbie or Smith as the scene is about to end.What I also found annoying was the narrative as it feels sloppy and does feel like its heading in the direction it should do, and with the consistent mad and fun atmosphere flowing through, but it does not quite match with what it concludes with at the end.The DCEU so far has not had a good start, but at the moment Suicide Squad is the lesser of three evils, with enjoyable action and fun. 7.0/10",Suicide Squad
367,jonnytheshirt,Enjoyable enough good and bad,6,23 November 2016,Was looking forward to this one and it was enjoyable. Suicide Squad has some major strengths let down by weaker elements and maybe an attempt to included too many characters. First off the Squad are all great I was even surprised to find I liked Captain Boomerang quite a bit (I've rarely seen Jai Courtney get a character with anything good going) I'd love to see him again. Jared leto's Joker was pretty great with little screen time and no real reason for being in the movie to be honest. He should have had a much bigger role and another element completely removed which was the major down point of the plot. And seriously some of those lines from Enchantress. Despite being a cool character as an idea and depiction the movie would have benefited much more from Joker being at the spear point plus it would have played well with Harley. Great soundtrack and characters with a stellar cast as well as colourful. It just missed on a level and actually looked a bit TV series at points. Shame could have been great but was just decent. On a second watch the good points tabs out even more and really seems like some messing about with the storyline was done detriment to the movie - would have been totally different had the Joker been the threat (which he should have Leto was great) and forgot about all that cgi nonsense.,Suicide Squad
368,anupapu8,Not much of a Redemption for DC fans,6,5 August 2016,"SUICIDE SQUAD - My plan for today was to watch two back to back movies , but watching SUICIDE SQUAD made me so much exhausted that i canceled my plan for the second film. And by exhausted i didn't mean by tiredness but by frustration. Things are not working for DC universe. Its all started really well with MAN OF STEEL , but DAWN OF JUSTICE disappointed and same goes for suicide squad. David AYER as director didn't faulted but as a writer he did a bad job. He has done some good writing before(FURY , END OF WATCH,U-571,TRAINING DAY) but he has done some bad writing too (2nd part of fast and furious series , yes the worst one and SABOTAGE , one of the worst movies having ARNOLD as hero). SUICIDE SQUAD fall in the 2nd category.SUICIDE SQUAD is a very limited movie as long as we talk about its scope. Let me tell you the story(obviously in brief and only that part which already have been showed in 4 trailers of this movie). A team of bad villains has been organized. A good half an hour has been spent on their introduction using some colorful visuals. Then one of those recruit ENCHANTRESS goes bad and want to destroy the world. So our team land on the city where this villain making some machine (which the movie never explain that what will it do if made completely) to extinct the human race. Then they fight and they win , and the story ends. SHOCKING RIGHT! i know , but that's the truth. There was no plot , its just the intro , then some comic moment and then the mission. O yes i forgot , there were some back stories too to make us connected to the characters , but non of it worked. Think of this, the movie first promoted itself as a group of bad people come together to do something good , then the movie tries to justifies that those people are not actually bad , but just the victim of bad situation, i mean how does this work does anybody think of that. Why cant they create some GREY characters who have conflicted hidden motives , why they have to show villain as good persons. It doesn't make sense. More then half of the movie is the mission they have been appointed for , that could also have been a nice entertaining movie , only if we have got some exceptional action sequences , but the movie lacks that too. Its just gunshot , some punches , some baseball bat shots and yes some fire (which is among the good visuals). A time when MARVEL movies are making us stun with fast martial arts and chasing sequences , DC universe is still stuck with old slow motion style action. I mean at the climax one of our hero throws a bomb towards the villain , and that bomb literally took almost 30 second too reach the villain. The selection of villain was bad too. Non of our heroes have superpower except DIABLO who had the ability to generate fire. And they still gavecompetition to a 6000 years old witch with exceptional superpowers. Imagine VOLDEMORT defeated by gunshot and rocket launchers of BATMAN , it literally felt like that. It was actually a shame for ENCHANTRESS to get defeated by SUICIDE SQUAD. We get two very small scenes of BATMAN. And those two scenes along with JUSTICE LEAGUE trailer make me realize that m actually in that state where i can get rid of the thing that Christian BALe is the best BATMAN , and i actually started liking Ben Afflecks. But same cant be said abound THE JOKER. He was a really small part of this movie. Not even a part of main plot, just as a side villain who comes and go in between the main plot. I didn't like this version of JOKER. Not at least in this small role. The humor word well . But cant say same about all the dialogues. take this as an example - A 6000 years old witch say to one of our Hero when he trying to kill her - YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BALLS TO DO IT. Really? Is that the way a witch must talk. Action scenes although didn't worked well but the visuals are good. But the darkness of the night scenes ruined it too. Bad cinematography. Which was disappointing because i was kind of liking the 3D at first. As i said the humor worked ,so at least the first half didn't bore. But the lack of any exceptional set piece bore you in the 2nd half. I don't even know how this story-line is gonna be connected to the main JUSTICE LEAGUE story-line. After watching this the whole DC universe seems so unplanned to me. WARNER BROS needs to do some serious thinking on it. 6.3/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR",Suicide Squad
369,residentgrigo,"First they drive you mad, and then they drag you to war",7,8 August 2016,"I have been a DC fan since the 90s, read thousands of issues, including every Squid Squad comics EVER. It' s my favorite US team comic of all time and the DCEU now produced the 3rd source accurate, yet critically despised film in a row. John Ostrander, the creator of the Squad (look him up!), ""loved"" this movie, yet it is being ripped apart for every sin under the sun. Including being an insult to the comic I was deathly afraid that the same insanity would tank BvS (read my 9,5/10 review for the UC) but it didn't. I am now happy that the critics hated this movie as I can't see myself liking a DCEU film they would. I am also a big Marvel film + comic fan, but why do they get universal acclaim for producing inferior movies that radically change the source material? NO comment, to the review:The narrative has a 2 act structure. The 1st half is an over the top black comedy with constantly changing ""theme songs"" to give quick characterization in a crowded cast. Guardians of the Galaxy had pop songs too, but so did Watchmen and the Crow. Stop the rip-off comments, and i liked all 3. The editing is universally criticized and was so fast that even i needed 5 minutes to adjust, and then it HIT me. The director tried to drive me mad, to get inside the character's heads, who are mostly mentally unstable convicts. Genius! All but Flag, Katana and Waller (debatable) are villains, yet the film is being ripped apart for having ""bad role"" models and violence. The film logo has bullet holes, and features the Joker! WTF? The films isn't exactly a feelgood movie either, never blindly compare it to Guardians again. Deadpool is the only US comic movie with similar ideas. Than hell on Earth, literally, breaks loose, and the mission starts. The 2nd half is a borderline bleak war movie, with the Squad and a Special Forces unit cleaning streets and rooms for about 1 hour. A few, universally spectacular flashbacks still occur, a few songs, outside of the well done score, still play but things get dark. That drove critics mad. A war movie about unwilling convicts being dark is a plus! A lot of action in an action film is good! A light in the sky, faceless hordes of enemies and an end-of-the-world plot show up. Just as in the hit comics or Raiders of the Lost Ark. Were these by Marvel too? That's the story. Simple and clean, yet twisted as a pretzel, including a few JLA cameos. Now, the very diverse Squad in alphabetical order:Amanda Waller: Davis nails it, and she ends up being the worst human in the movie, outside of the Joker. The body count on her head makes her the deadliest DCEU (anti-)villain to date. Let's see if she can redeem herself later. Captain Boomerang: Courtney again reminds us that he can act, if the script is good. He even comes back like a + 1 for the safety Unicorn. Deadshot: The 70s version is played well by Smith and his well-used daughter has a comic counterpart. You can see how happy The Fresh Prince of Belle Reve is to be in a good movie, for once! El Diablo: Hernandez made a mostly unknown villain a highlight, as such characters are Ayer's forte. The way he was forced to ""power down"" is fascinating and very daring for a (hard) PG-13 movie. Enchantress: Delevingne's ability to go from creepy to deliberately campy inside the same scene is impressive. Certainly the best version of her, critics can suck it. Another great DC big-bad and her romance with Flag had heart, hehe. Who further cares that her ""brother"", who serves as muscle in cool action scenes, is left unexplored. He is an enforcer, based on a 2 issue villain. How can this be a MAIN criticism? Good on WB for daring a witchcraft-based villain, despite knowing that it would get the film banned in China! Harley Quinn: Robbie played the New52 version, who is a child-killer, so let's stop the role model criticism, and her creator liked her. This version also said that another character needed to ""own"" being a child-killer here. The Joker (Azzarello's grounded mobster + Morrison's Thin White Duke), also showed genuine love for ""his creation"", so this movie nailed their dynamic. Especially during her chemical transformation. The movie's best moment and a highlight for the genre. Joker: Leto was the best part of the movie but I am glad that his constant presence was trimmed down by the constantly misreported (surprise?) re-edits. Longer scenes with him would have derailed the picture BEYOND recognition and only 1 whole scene (a short 3rd act gunfight) appears to be left out. He is also the most comic accurate movie version to date and our second perfect interpretation in a row. Katana: Fukuhara did well for a debut perforce and I hope that her backstory will be further explored later. The cracks in the dog on a leach persona were already telling. + 1 for Japanese dialogue with subtitles. Killer Croc: Akinnuoye-Agbaje's inhuman make-up deserves an Oscar, and he is based on the Azzarello version. These movies aren't afraid to dive deep! Rick Flag: Kinnaman played the no-nonsense soldier with conviction well and hints of inner darkness were a pleasant surprise. His repertoires with Deadshot were spot on. A straight man and shooter. Slipknot: Beach did the one thing the character was supposed to do right, 'nuff said.The action-driven black comedy will ultimately please fans of the DCEU and haters will continue to be baffled by their popularity. David Ayer ain't a perfect, yet innovative, director and delivered his best movie, together with End of Watch. He now earned a life-long fan with me. The DCEU's future never looked brighter and don't forget to read this month's Suicide Squad Rebirth. 8,5/10",Suicide Squad

The weakened Enchantress looked cool, but once powerful just looked like a bit of a cgi mess. Films like this thrive on having an interesting antagonist, and sadly this one isn't. Still, its the best DC film probably since Watchmen....",Suicide Squad
372,simonparker1990,A jumbled mess with a good cast,4,6 August 2016,"I am writing this review as someone who very much enjoyed Batman Vs Superman. The Ultimate Edition was far superior to the theatrical version, and while both are flawed I did see what DC were going for and I find it a very entertaining movie. To be honest I thought Suicide Squad was a sure- fire success. The trailers and marketing has been excellent, the idea sounded original and it seemed like DC was going to learn from its mistakes. Unfortunately I could not have been more wrong, Suicide Squad is close to being a disaster on the same level of Fantastic Four, the only thing redeeming it from this level is the fact that the cast all seemed excellent and there were a couple of good scenes dotted in the movie somewhere.Let's get the good out of the way first. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Jai Courtney and Viola Davis are all excellent. I was concerned that it may end up being the Will Smith show, but he works well in an ensemble and he seems to be having a blast as Headshot. Margot Robbie is perfect as Harley Quinn, could not fault her performance (even if she has been sexualised quite a lot in this movie, this is a fault for nearly all the female characters). Jared Leto may not be present a lot and is not a patch on Heath Ledger, however he does something different with the role of the Joker. I did like his performance and would enjoy seeing him in a standalone Batman movie. Jai Courtney was a pleasant surprise and Viola Davis sells a role that could come across as one dimensional in lesser hands. The cast all work well together, seem to be having fun and have a couple of good group scenes that have been seen in the trailers.Now onto the bad. I am intrigued to find out what was going on behind the scenes, as it is very evident from an early stage that studio and director seem to be making two different movies. This is where I quite happily make the Fantastic Four comparison, there was interference with that movie and it clearly showed. While Suicide Squad is nowhere near as clear cut as the divide with that movie, you can see on one hand there is a dark movie being made and on the other a silly group movie more along the lines of Guardians of the Galaxy. Both would work fine as a movie, but DC should have picked one and stuck with it. The editing is appalling, there appears to be multiple openings to the movie and introductions to the same character. Flashbacks spring up out of nowhere, some adding interesting backstory (such as The Joker and Harley's scenes) some just being downright pointless (Katana I am looking at you). The poor editing may have been forgivable with a decent story and villain, unfortunately this is where Suicide Squad falls flat on its face. The villain (The Enchantress) is downright terrible and spends the third act doing a weird sort of dance in front of a portal. Cara Delevingne may be a good actress, I wouldn't know as she has nothing to do in this movie and is terribly overdubbed in some scenes. In conclusion it gets 4 stars based on the charisma of the cast alone. I can't say I was bored as I was spending most of the time gazing at the car crash of the story. It really emphasises the fact that DC are panicking with their properties at the moment. Had this been the original movie that it set out to be I am sure it may have been fine. Unfortunately someone has stepped in somewhere and made changes in a blind panic. It shows and stinks of studio interference. It is worth watching obviously to make your mind up, some people seem to have loved it. I am glad they have, I wish I had certainly enjoyed it. But even those rampantly defending it must be aware of its glaring faults. I would be interested in a sequel, there is a good film to be made with this cast. But there has to be a solid story, even a solid cast cannot polish a turd.",Suicide Squad
373,trevorwomble,A bit of a dud to be honest,6,15 August 2018,"A bunch of incarcerated DC villains are forced to team up and unite in a fight against an evil superpower intent on destroying the world.Yes, it's that unoriginal, a variation on the 'Dirty Dozen' theme. This mess of a film apparently cost a lot to produce, has a seriously miscast Jared Leto as a demented but not physically intimidating Joker and some totally forgettable minor characters. In fact the one plus that raises this film from a four star to a six star review is Margot Robbie. Not only does she make a great Harley Quinn but she manages to outshine Will Smith here, really giving her character an on-screen presence. It's just a shame the rest of the film is forgettable.",Suicide Squad
374,drew_atreides,"It was okay, but could have been more",7,4 August 2016,"...i was 1 of the few who enjoyed ""Batman Vs. Superman"" (was not such a huge fan of ""Man of Steel""), so I was interested in seeing the next step in this new DC theatrical universe..For the most part it was okay. Decently entertaining. Margot Robbie predictably steals the movie, but Viola Davis is quite good playing a very cool and efficient Amanda Waller. Will Smith is serviceable as Deadshot. The eye-opener for me was Cara Delevingne. Her Enchantress character, in the early going, was very intriguing. I think the most disappointing performance in the movie was Jared Leto's Joker. Maybe it is because he didn't really have much to work with, but he was really kind of a non-entity for me. I didn't find him interesting in the slightest, which is about the worst thing i think you could say about a character like The Joker. The movie itself is stronger in its first half then it is in its second. I preferred the DIRTY DOZEN-esque recruitment scenes, when you didn't really know who you could trust, or when Amanda would kill someone. The second half of the film becomes a paint by numbers ""Everyone comes together to save the day"" super hero flick. That was disappointing. Still, most of the characters were colourful and interesting, and it leaves off at a point where i am interested in seeing what comes next for the DCU.I'm still in for the long haul.",Suicide Squad
375,Dannyboi94,"Decent, but messy",5,7 August 2016,"First of all, the critics have been very harsh on this film, it is not as bad as people are making it out to be, but it is not a great film either. It is entertaining, but messy as hell. The editing in this film is dreadful, and like Batman V Superman, you find yourself watching it, and know instantly that something is missing. They must have cut a lot out of this film, as some scenes make little sense, and jump between each other, making it quite confusing.It does start off very well, the first twenty minuets are very good. The Batman cameo, and Deadshot character was very well done. Will Smith did a great job as he carries this movie. His charisma is perfect and suits his role very well. Now Margot Robbie was ideal for Harley, she was perfect, everything she did was well thought out, and you truly believed that she was insane.The main villain in this film, is a little letdown. Without spoiling anything, the villain felt more like a video game boss. But the most interesting thing, is the Joker. Jared Leto is a fantastic actor and he was ... very underused. We were given the impression that the Joker would be a big part, as they kept his character quiet. While Jared was fantastic here, you truly believed that he was mental and loved Harley. There was some sweet moments with him, but he was given barely any screen- time. No one should compare Jared's Joker with Heath's Joker, they are two different characters. But Jared does a fantastic job at making you want to see more, and I hope we see him as a major villain in the future movies.This is a good film, but it is all over the place. I want to see a completed version of the film, which I believe would be a lot better. 5.4/10",Suicide Squad

Joker was a horrible rendition. Not so much Leto's fault, just bad idea from writer.

383,Jini-B,Disappointing,4,7 August 2018,"Considering all the hype this has gotten, I was expecting a cracker of a movie, but this fizzled out. The movie just seemed pointless. The story was not well-structured enough and it seemed like the main conflict in the story was brought on by the good guys themselves. I liked the special effects and the background music, but there isn't a lot to write home about. With characters like El Diablo, Harley Quinn and Deadshot, a lot could have been done but this movie just did not work out for me.As an independent movie, without the DC supervillains, I would have rated this higher, because it was somewhat entertaining. But the supervillains just seemed like a waste in this film. Some really bad casting choices- Cara Delevingne was atrocious and I was cringing every time she came on screen. However, Margot Robbie was good as Harley Quinn.This was a waste of time. Left a lot to be desired.",Suicide Squad

The villain is just thrown in there, I bont know anything about him, and hes not even interesting enough for me to want to know more about him.

The movie could be boiled to 'edgy guys talk each other in a dark room, then guns go bang bang'
Just no.",Suicide Squad
386,Brevin_Campbell,A flawed film with characters that work,7,13 August 2016,"Before the wreck that was Batman v Superman happened I was rather extremely hopeful on this movie, and it was the one film I was anticipating more than Batman v Superman. I have always adored the Harley Quinn character and what Bruce Timm and Paul Dini did with her. I am also a huge Deadshot and while I didn't think Will Smith was the best choice for Deadshot I was still intrigued with what the actor could bring to the table. And then Batman v Superman came out and it was a huge disappointment and tampered my anticipation for Suicide Squad. Also the fact that in the marketing they were pushing all the musical cues my way also hurt my anticipation for the film overall. But with all the my hopes and dreams being dashed by a rocky start for DC and a bunch of trailers feeling more like music videos than actual trailers I did come out of this film liking it quite a lot. Now from top to bottom this movie is cliché. We get a really boring villain that you have seen in every Marvel film and you have a team of characters having to stop this villain from destroying the world. That piece of the movie is very standard and something we have seen being done over and over again endlessly. However this film makes up for those clichés with its characters that are really all quite something to fall in love with. Rather its Killer Croc's one liners, Deadshot's love for his daughter, Harley Quinn's love for the Joker, and the Joker's overall insanity everyone has something interesting to add to this film. This makes the film a lot more fun and a lot more easier to get through. The comedy is great as I found myself laughing a lot throughout my first screening of the film and it all just works on all cylinders. If you are a fan of these types of films with super powered characters then I think you will defiantly enjoy Suicide Squad quite a bit. It brings some light hearted enjoyment to the dark and gross DC cinematic universe.",Suicide Squad
387,mwcrunner,Must say what a disappointment for a movie,1,5 August 2016,"Yeah I don't like to agitate anyone who liked this movie, but to be honest I agree with the critics on Rotten Tomatoes. This movie was a worthless piece of garbage. I mean the casting of this movie was off and it was sort of laughable too and the guy who played the Joker in this was nowhere near as good as Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill. Jared Leto is the worst Joker ever. He doesn't even deserve to play the Joker again in future DC films. I mean he can't even laugh as good as Heath Ledger or Mark Hamill and both Ledger and Hamill are legends. Jared Leto is nothing more then an amateur. Also the Joker doesn't need tattoos or bling in his teeth. Joker is fine with just his purple suit, green hair, white face and creepy evil smile or scars. Also Will Smith just sort of lost his way of acting and he was much better off being in Independence Day and Men in Black. I also like his role in the Pursuit of Happiness. Also Joker usually doesn't care for Harley Quinn that much, but it looked like he did care for her a lot in this. What's up with that? I also know in the game Batman Arkham City Joker got Harley pregnant. Also how the hell did Joker survive drowning in the ocean and that helicopter crash? There were no explanations for either of those things. I also still don't care about Ben Affleck being Batman and the only good part of this movie was that he was only in like 3 parts of it. Also the main villain in this movie reminded me of Gozer the Traveller from Ghostbusters and that scene where she was using her powers to take over the world was just like the scene in Ghostbusters where Gozer and her temple were on top of that building except that it was inside a building like in Ghostbusters 2 where Vigo was trying to come out of his painting but the Ghostbusters slimed him back into it. I mean this Enchantress person was exactly like Gozer from Ghostbusters and after she is defeated, that wife of Flag came out of her skin just like Dana and Louis came out the shells of Vintz Clortho and Zuul after the Ghostbusters defeat Gozer and Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Also I understood most of the lines in this movie, but still there wasn't very good dialogue in this. This movie is so lame that it proves that Marvel will always be better then DC. The only good part about DC is the Dark Knight Trilogy and Christian Bale still makes a better Batman then Ben Affleck. This is film is worse then Batman vs Superman.",Suicide Squad
388,CriticalOfEverything,An absolute laughing stock.,1,22 October 2018,"Suicide Squad is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen. It is one of the worst ANYTHINGS I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious, apart from Will Smith playing Deadshot. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto both stick out to me with how bad they are. These have to be the worst incarnations of The Joker and Harley Quinn ever put to screen. Margot is just straight up annoying and is only in there for sex appeal, and Jared's acting is absolutely horrible. Every other actor leans on bad or average. The characters are all idiots and are completely one dimensional. The storyline is so unbearably stupid and is riddled with plot holes and the overall editing and effects are god awful. The fight scenes in The Amazing Spider-Man look better than any of the scenes in this movie. This movie was only made for fan-service. They did not give two craps about the quality of this absolute disaster. And somehow, against all the odds, this movie got an Oscar......HOW???

The points I have given are for the effects and for Margot Robbie's acting. She's a tad exaggerated as Harley Quinn but appealing in her effort to justify her role. The rest of the squad looked like they had all been hired the last minute and did it for the obvious reason, in dollar signs. If there's a chance for you to watch it for free and you ain't got nothing to do then it's your risk.

391,twpain,Just a mess,4,25 June 2020,Suicide Squad is a huge missed opportunity! The film seems to only focus on Harley and Deadshot while the other characters are just there in the background. The plot is very messy and some of the characters choices are kinda dumb. Enchantress is a terrible villain I don't know her motive or what her powers are. The pacing in this film is not good either. On the plus side of things Deadshot and Harley are good characters but other than that Suicide Squad has nothing else going for it.,Suicide Squad
392,midas-jacobs,Did I have fun? kind of. Was It good? not really,6,7 August 2016,"""Suicide Squad"" exist from bad guys. The group they'll send in when they can't afford losing anyone. To control them, they have a bomb in their neck and a gift to look forward to. If they succeed, they'll lose 10 years of their sentence. If they don't, they die. Now the squad has a mission. ""Suicide Squad"" is directed by the wonderful director David Ayer. I call him wonderful because of his previous films (""End of Watch"" and ""Fury), but this time I wouldn't call him wonderful. Don't get me wrong, I like the guy and a lot of his movies, but this time he just fell short. His directing wasn't in his style and felt forced for me. But he also made some bold choices that were probably demanded by the studios, throughout the review you'll know what I mean. The visual directing was fine, it was a bit to dark for me. It wasn't always clear what was going on. The cinematography also was a bit on the same level of the directing not great not horrible. This was done by Roman Vasyanov, who has worked with Ayer before in his best movies (The previous named ones). But let's change things up with something really good. The soundtrack. Man this was maybe the best part of the movie. I didn't expect to hear ""Seven Nation Army"", but now that I've heard it in the movie I realize that it kind of fits. Same goes with ""Bohamian Rhapsody"" of Queen, which we had heard before in the trailer. This song was very well chose; it was chaotic, which complimented the movie very well. But these weren't the only good songs, of course. The styles of music changed a lot, but this was only to accentuate the chaotic feel of the movie. If Ayer had any involvement in this, than he did a really good job. Now let's move on to something bad again. The editing. This wasn't always bad, but a lot of the time it was. The movie suffers from pacing issues and sometimes it feels like there was just edited a part out. For example: when Harley breaks the window and takes something, wherafter she walks away. After she has the little dialogue with Flag it seems that the scene ends, but it doesn't. There is just a brief shot of something else, but then moves on to Will Smith walking to the same thing to look at a jacket. This was obviously a re-shoot. That's also the reason why there was this editing mistake. I can't comprehend why you could let such a mistake slide in such a big budget movie. And this isn't the only editing mistake, but I'll quite there. I still have a minor issue to say and this involves the sound. This is just a detail, that I think could've easily been fixed. When The Joker and Harley are in the helicopter and are talking there is no sound whats-however of the helicopter, but in some scenes they thought of adding the helicopter sound. So why not here?The acting was very well done. I think that the actors were all well cast and fitted them well. I'll just talk about a few of them, due to the word limit. The first one I want to talk about is Will Smith. I was very skeptical when he got cast, because he is nothing like the character Deadshot, but he nailed it. He was good in the emotional scenes (where a lot of them were re-shoots I believe) and also in the other. Margot Robbie is next on my list. Her portrayal of Harley was really good. It was like she was ripped straight from the comic- book. The only thing that I have to say about her is that her accent sometimes went away, but that's just a minor detail. Jai Courntey is also someone I quickly want to mention. I can't believe I'm saying this, but he actually was good. This is the first movie I've seen of him where he is good. If you want to hear something about Jared Leto as The Joker... I can't really say yet. I haven't seen a lot of him, but judging on the things seen, I can say he over-acted a bit, but was fine overall. A thing that I disliked about his character was that he was completely useless in the movie. The writing is one of the bigger problems of the movie. The dialogue wasn't neccesairliy bad, but the story overall was. It was your cliché superhero movie, which ends with a generic bad guy and a laser beam pointing up in the sky. It's nothing new and it is told a billion times before. Almost all of the times it ended up with being bad, so why would it work now. The one-liners did work. They were funny and witty, but sometimes there were some cringe-worthy ones. The one- liners were mostly given to Deadshot and Harley: the stars of the movie. The characters were well developed, but how they were developed was not the greatest. They really push it in your face every time it happens they're like: 'Look sad things have happened to them. Now care about them.' But the only person that they kill of, where they want you to care about, wasn't well developed. So was the villain. There was no motivation for her to do these things, they don't even explain it. But how they introduced the characters was done in a fun way, but the editing was a bit sloppy there. And I don't know why they didn't introduce everyone of them. That didn't make any sense.In the end I have to say that this isn't Ayers best film. It has a lot of problems, but the acting and soundtrack do carry the movie for a big part. Thats why I'm giving this movie a 6.4/10",Suicide Squad

395,drawlife,"So far, one of this year's worst.",4,5 August 2016,"Ugh. What a waste. It's baffling how the marketing of this film, especially the trailers sold me on how fun and exciting this movie looked. Whoever cut those trailers absolutely deserves an Academy Award. To make this garbage of a film look any good must have been quite a feat. Lets get straight to it, the whole film is about a team that unwillingly comes together by the shady side of the government in a really long and drawn out series of flashbacks and origin hoopla that has you so bored that you end up wondering what the movie is about. Oh yeah and there's this lame witch villain, Enchantress that is handled so very poorly.On top of it, there's an unnecessary Joker & Harley Quinn romance stuff going on, which weirdly doesn't end up involving anyone else. It's like a strange side story that happens while the main story is going on. It's giant narrative mess. It's very choppy, very muddled, and doesn't do a good job explaining anything within the middle of the action. There's no sense of danger and the film shoehorns in forced humor, therefore making tonal inconsistencies that took me out of the film every so often. It's very clear that WB banked on Will Smith's star power, and the popularity of Harley Quinn. Aside from those two and maybe El Diablo, Rick Flagg and Amanda Waller, no one else has anything to do. More time could have been developed for other members of the squad, but they're just in the background. I got to sympathize with Deadshot the most, but I wasn't really captivated because it was exactly the role I expected him to play. Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and the others do the best with what they're given, but ultimately decent acting from some of the cast members won't change the fact that it's a terrible disjointed film. Clara Delevingne's Enchantress was a monumental waste of a villain. The script just uses her as that tried trope of a world ending threat that we've seen so many times. The film does nothing new with it, nor does it try to do it well, even if it is a familiar trope. Her acting was just so atrocious and laughable. As stated above, Jared Leto's Joker doesn't have much to do. His arc of the film with Harley has nothing to do with the main story so it's just a distraction. I had no problem with his portrayal, but the film really did not need him at all. For me David Ayer is a hit or miss. While I have enjoyed a few of his previous works, especially End of Watch, he failed to deliver with this film. It's lazily written, with terrible dialog, the story is incredibly choppy, and even the action sequences disappoint. Don't even get me started on the finale. It's half-assed and so anti-climactic. There was no sense of danger or any tension. Ayer once mentioned how we will see the squad bond with their hatred of Batman, and that we will get the villain's perspective on Batman, but aside from Deadshot, that wasn't really explored at all. Also those eyeball creatures, they were lame. I mean visually was that really the best the filmmakers could come up with? I don't want to make comparisons, but this film made me realize and appreciate what Guardians of the Galaxy accomplished. Taking a bunch of C/D-list characters that aren't the best people in the world, and making something out of them. I don't want to start a fanboy war, but it amazes me that Marvel Studios who have been at such disadvantage since the start, pull off what they did. Making films that are at the very least entertaining is quite impressive, compared to WB/DC that have had the film rights to these properties for such a long time. I don't mind that they're playing catch up but there's a way to do them well. It is very discouraging as a comic-book fan in general, but I'm still hoping that DC's future will take into shape. I've made it clear that I am not a DC hater. I've stated numerous times I loved Man of Steel. I saw it five times in theaters and could not anticipate DC's future, but so far I was disappointed by Batman v Superman, now today, I am massively letdown by Suicide Squad. I'm hoping Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman will change my tune and that Snyder will deliver with Justice League. At the end of the day it's all subjective. If you enjoyed this movie, more power to you, my review doesn't make me the end all be all. But, aside from some okay performances, a very tiny Batman role, and a cool surprise appearance from another DC hero, you should save your money. Just go see a decent summer film like Star Trek Beyond or Lights Out. Or just go watch Captain America: Civil War and Deadpool, comic-book films done extremely right. 4/10",Suicide Squad

397,wrightiswright,Could've been much better...,6,14 December 2016,"Judging by the general online reaction to this movie, there seems to be a lot of disappointment surrounding it. Myself... I'm on the fence. Margot Robbie and Will Smith are great as Deadshot and Harley Quinn respectively, and it can't be a coincidence that these are the only two characters who are properly fleshed out with proper backstories, believable motives and layered personalities.The others aren't nearly so lucky, with Jared Leto's Joker especially seeming like a bit of an insult after the much-missed Heath Ledger's inimitable take on the character. The plot is a confused jumble of mystical Armageddon nonsense, and while the action occasionally thrills, such moments are brief, then it's back to the forced bonding again between our mostly underwritten cast. Whoopee.The makers of this franchise should take a leaf from Marvel's Avengers playbook, whereby the characters always come first and the special effects come second. A less convoluted storyline might help, too. Things might be a bit clearer on the inevitable 3 hour+ 'Special Edition' DVD, but how many would rewatch it to find that out? My guess would be: Pretty low. 6/10",Suicide Squad
398,mjplysaght,Wasted potential,2,12 January 2017,"So, I don't even know where to start with this one.Seeing as the script took just six weeks to write, the result is clear as day. An absolute disaster story-wise. Having to establish an ensemble of completely new characters to the uninitiated, with the use of distracting edits and literally spelling out who everyone is by use of stylized captions? Really?Sigh. This film is guilty of false advertising. The marketing and promotion lured the crowd in for what essentially was a dark Avengers flick. Boy, did they miss the mark?! This film fails on almost every level. The frantic pace in which they try to establish the main characters and the plot in the first half hour is just incredible. They try to make the characters relatable by utilizing fleeting flashbacks, desperately trying to make them seem relatable. It fails. Some characters don't even get the luxury of a 'backstory' and their motivations are simply explained through expository dialogue.The plot is about as standard as you can get with these superhero films. The only difference is that they're villains/convicts that get coerced into vigilantism. They have to defeat the antagonist and save the world. The execution is carried out so poorly though. Aside from Deadshot and Harley Quinn, character development for everyone else is just thrown out the window. I mean, for god's sake, they introduce a guy to the team who gets axed a few minutes later! And don't get me started on the Joker. Good God. Everybody was anticipating Jared Leto's interpretation of the character and for what we saw of him, he did alright, for what, the TWO, MAYBE THREE SCENES HE WAS IN?! I was a bit skeptical of modelling him after a pimp, with the teeth grille and velvet jacket. But at least use him a bit more if Leto is SECOND BILLING IN THE CAST!!! The utilization of the soundtrack sounded like it was mixed by some intern who first discovered the editing software. Back to back pop songs we've heard in the trailer for the first half and a criminal misuse of them at that.Look, I can complain about this film and what it did wrong until the cows come home, and upon first viewing, I was quite sparing in my criticism, saying it was OK. Upon re-evaluation, it's a disaster. A complete insult to the crowd who were enticed by what they promised in the trailers/marketing.",Suicide Squad
399,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Another mess from DC/WB,4,6 August 2016,"I don't know what it is with DC, but they haven't had a superhero film with a well-developed story since Nolan left the scene. Their latest movie, Suicide Squad, has too many characters, too many flashbacks, and a poorly written action plot, resulting in a pretty boring movie. Suicide Squad starts shortly after Batman v. Superman. Superman's death influenced ARGUS chief Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to assemble a team of super powered villains to fight against meta-human threats. Don't ask me why she doesn't just ask Batman, the Flash, and Wonder Woman.The team members consist of Deadshot (Will Smith), the best hit-man in the world; Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the Joker's deranged girlfriend and former psychiatrist; Diablo (Jay Hernandez), a super-villain who controls fire; Captain Boomerang, who literally just throws boomerangs really well; Killer Croc, (Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje) a super strong villain who is part man and part crocodile; and Slipknot, (Adam Beach), who can climb walls. The team is assembled to take out the super villainess Enchantress, a witch who wants to destroy the world. But the team is kept in the dark about the true nature of their mission, and they are just told to basically point and shoot at whatever they come across, until they learn the truth at the end. During the mission, the Joker (Jared Leto) intervenes to take Harley Quinn back, causing trouble for everyone.Developing all of these characters and delivering a good action movie seemed to be beyond the ability of the filmmakers. Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Amanda Waller are the only characters who really stand out. Will Smith gives a good performance – his trademark personality doesn't overwhelm the character, which I was worried about. Margot Robbie nails it as Harley Quinn, her mannerisms, her humor, everything. Viola Davis is just chilling as Amanda Waller. The rest of the cast might as well have not been there. Jai Courtney is funny when he has something to say. Slipknot, Killer Croc, and Diablo disappear at times during the movie and you don't miss them. Slip Knot and Killer Croc in particular are given little to no character development. There's also a bodyguard named Katana whose only development comes from a few throwaway lines. These are some of the least memorable characters you'll meet in a blockbuster action film.Flashbacks are the primary mechanism for developing the characters and I just think that that's pretty lazy. It works well enough for Dead Shot and Harley, but it would have been better if we had seen these characters develop relationships with each other on screen in real time instead of diverting so much time from the plot at hand. By the end of the movie they're this big happy family and it doesn't feel convincing. As for Jared Leto's heavily promoted Joker performance, all I can say is ""meh"". I didn't think he was scary or funny and most of his scenes could have been cut. In fact they probably should have been cut to develop other characters better. So while the supporting characters are pretty forgettable, the plot is pretty forgettable too. The team just wanders around a city without much direction until they find Enchantress. The story is not well served by mediocre action scenes either. When Star Trek Beyond has better action scenes than a superhero (or in this case, a super-villain movie), that's pretty bad. All in all, this was a pretty dull movie, only marginally better than WB's previous outing (although I haven't seen the ultimate cut of BvS yet). This project seems to have suffered from a classic case of too many hands in the pot - studio micromanagers may have changed the movie so much that it didn't resemble Director David Ayer's original vision. WB employed the company that cut the trailer to make the movie funnier apparently. I've never heard of a major studio using a trailer company to recut their film. Plus, I heard the script was written in six weeks (not smart). Maybe we'll see a better cut on home video, but DC can't keep relying on director's cuts to save their projects. They have to shape up soon, or they will see disappointing box office returns.",Suicide Squad
400,tjgoalie13,"A Talented Cast Trapped in a Rushed, Crowded Mess",5,5 August 2016,"Suicide Squad, the next entry in the ever bleak DC Cinematic Universe, is here and frankly I was disappointed. The hype for this film was big and expectations may have been admittedly very high, but this film fails on a level deeper than just a bad movie where a good movie was expected. Suicide Squad features a great cast, but falls flat in terms of story, and rushes through its already thin story. What's so sad is that the formula for a really good movie was there and the filmmakers ignored it completely.With a film that has so many talented stars in it, and Jai Courtney, it's not surprising that the expectations were very high for the film. Will Smith is not immune to bad decisions when it comes to his films, but he's pretty good at rising above them and making films better all on his own. Jared Leto is pretty great in this film, he'll undoubtedly be judged by comparisons to other Joker performances, but just on his own merit he was great. The entire cast did a good job, Smith, Leto, Viola Davis, and Margot Robbie were all excellent in their performances, but they were failed by a poorly crafted film.The biggest problem is the fact that the screenwriter and director seemed to not be on the same page, when it came to what this film was about, or more precisely who this film is about. To me, it's about Rick Flag and the Enchantress. However, clearly somebody in the process missed that and felt that every character needed an appropriate amount of backstory, which they don't. The result of this confusion is two cardinal sins, the first is that the audience is given a lot of needless scenes of backstory that we don't need that waters down the story. The second and far more egregious is that the better story was very clearly sitting within this watered down, and crowded mess that we ended up with.Without spoilers this film rushes through introducing all of it's characters and giving backstory, for almost every one of them. Frankly there are more subtle and effective ways to show us something than 5 minute flashbacks for every character. Above that we can't care about the characters, besides Amanda Waller who you will grow to hate because Viola Davis gave an amazing performance, which really hurts the film because they were on to something. The painful thing is that if the filmmakers had looked at what they had, they may have noticed that certain alternative plot points would have been far more emotionally impactful, and they just missed them.It's easy to see how some will enjoy this film, it's not boring, or unenjoyable. This film just suffers from the same problem that Batman v. Superman did, the better film rests within the mess we were given. In the end Suicide Squad is rushed, crowded, features a weak villain, and feels like a poor man's Guardians of the Galaxy. That being said kids may enjoy this film and comic book die hards like will too, simply for the spectacle.",Suicide Squad
401,thisseatofmars,Marvel movies have become formulaic. Here is DC working out its own formula.,5,15 October 2016,"Another DC movie that's not Batman, but Batman related. How does it stack up? After the over serious drab-fest that was Superman v Batman, ""Squad"" tries to be hip and cool with bullets, a greatest hits soundtrack (Oh, wow, Eminem. This song came out in, like, 2001) and a constant stream of bad jokes from Harley Quinn. You know it's a joke because the scene is serious and she says something in her baby doll voice to either add to or break the tension. That's how you know it's a joke.""Squad"" breaks convention by, instead of having the black guy being killed first, they kill off the First Nations guy instead. Very progressive, guys! And making the Australian a typical boozehound puts the cherry on the stereotype sundae.Flag's southern accent is tedious. ""Woo, now, baby girl, ain't that kind of mission."" Jesus. Most guys who inject ""y'all"" into their sentences shake like leaves when you make direct eye contact.Will Smith rocks it as Deadshot. He shoots things and then they die. But how is it that Harley Quinn is able to do more with a baseball bat than a team of soldiers with army training and machine guns? While she's wearing needle-heels and hot pants, no less? (And what's with those hot pants and heels? I hope the Suicide Squad is never sent anyplace in winter.) Jared Hess's performance of the joker (sorry, I have a hard time capitalizing it) is really hard to watch. Less of a portrayal and more of a performance, Hess is constantly breathy, draws out his words, and is all around embarrassing to watch. Why can't we have Jack Nicholson again? In reading about ""Squad"" you'll learn that many of his scenes were cut from the final edit: in watching his performance, it's easy to see why. It's as if instead of a vat of chemicals, this version of the joker fell into a septic tank.Speaking of septic tanks, Harley's hot pants are constantly riding up, so we're given unwelcome wide shots of her bare cheeks *constantly.* It makes me think of the ad campaign for ""Squad"" in the weeks leading up to this movie's release: mostly Harley and shots of her pale clown butt. Did you know that pornography is related to necrophilia? No resistance, no rejection.So, bad stuff so far. Onto the good: Killer Croc's makeup looks fantastic and Will Smith is as charismatic as ever (despite playing an ultra one-dimensional character. He's doin' it for the kids, yo.) Plus, it's pretty funny when Quinn's baby doll voice slips into normal.But that said: for as stale as the superhero genre has become, I'm glad the movie DC universe is fleshing itself out with films like this. Don't let Marvel take all of the cake, guys.On a final note, Captain Boomerang makes me think of Tom Hardy from Mad Max, which is a much superior film. Watch Mad Max instead.",Suicide Squad

403,andrewmerritt-31652,This is not Suicide Squad.,1,27 January 2019,"Suicide Squad stars Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jared Leto, Viola Davis, and Jai Courtney. It is also directed by David Ayer who directed movies like Harsh Times and End of Watch. The first time I heard about Suicide Squad was from watching Batman Assault on Arkham. In that movie Task Force X also known as Suicide Squad has to sneak into Arkham and grab a flash drive that the Riddler has. And when I heard about them doing a Suicide Squad movie I was excited even the trailer had me pump for the movie. I didn't see it in theatres, but I got it on Blu ray and I was ready to go I was excited, and afterwards the movie left me disappointed. First off I don't think anyone involved producing, directing, or writing knows anything about Suicide Squad. This is not what the Suicide Squad should look like. The Suicide Squad should be about criminals who are forced to cooperate with the government while also remaining villains. Instead were left with a movie where they resolve there differences with themselves and the government and they eventually save the day and are respected. The writing is terrible that it sounds like someone who read Suicide Squad, but instead of going for a hardcore Suicide Squad we have what Doctor Evil might say a mini or the diet coke of Suicide Squad, just one calorie. I love David Ayer as a director. He's made some fantastic movies, but him directing this wasn't the best fit for him and I believed he did have a plan, but that idea was scrapped. I was hoping for an R rated version, but instead we have a PG-13 version filled in with jokes that are trying way to hard to impress the audience, but they fall flat on their head. Joker has always been a big edition to Batman and Suicide Squad, but when he's on screen he's covered in tattoos who looks more like Scarface than the clown prince of crime. And he's not in the movie that long more like thirty minutes and vanishes until he shows up again. Even the extended cut of the film can't save this trash of a film. I could go on and on about what went wrong with Suicide Squad, but the point I'm trying to make is that watch Batman Assault on Arkham instead of this trash because that is what Suicide Squad is supposed to be not this.",Suicide Squad
404,RJBrez,"Despite its flaws, still entertains, and gives me hope for the future",6,7 August 2016,"Suicide Squad will be remembered as a failure for some fans and I understand the complaints about it. The positive side of me is trying to be forgiving to the DC universe because I know they are rushed and trying to play catch up to Marvel. The negative side of me was just baffled at a few things. Spoilers ahead.-The CGI. WTF is all I can really say. I get it for the most part, it's a comic book movie, yeah yeah, but come on. The diablo effects were laughable. Most of the scenes with Enchantress and her minions were as well. Will this be the theme of all the DC movies? Are they doing this intentionally to try and have more of a comic feel? -Enchantress is the main protagonist was the best they could come up with? A weak villain does not keep the interest of casual fans. I know this movie was designed with the thought of having the Joker used for future films, but this angle with Enchantress really didn't click. And why does every villain need to design a ""machine""? A few of the positives I noticed were: +Margot Robbie was incredible and perfectly cast for this Role.+Although they had limited screen time, Batman and Joker were excellent.+Good to see some continuity within the DC universe. Small details matter, like mentioning Superman & Batman, metahumans, etc. This will pay off for DC if they keep working! Overall, it is clear DC still has plenty of work to do to please their fans. I was still pleased despite some plot holes and will continue to look forward to future movies.6/10.Rob",Suicide Squad

The song choices were really good as well in my opinion and fit into the scenes. Thumbs down for the generic rap song during the credits though.The humor worked really well and I enjoyed myself - so did my friends. So overall I'd say it's a decent movie.",Suicide Squad
406,WooderIce64,Worst Comic Book Movie Ever?,2,25 January 2018,"This movie is pure garbage. After the disappointment brought on by Batman V Superman, it was quite evident that things were heading in the wrong direction for DC. Here, expectations were set at rock bottom, and even then, it failed to reach them. I can easily say that this is the most boring superhero movie around, at least of those that are part of current canons. After the first third of the movie, which is entirely introducing characters, it consists primarily of the Squad walking. The first part, with the exposition, wasn't that bad. It got dull after a while, but still could've been worse. What's worse is that the story is just plain dumb. Basically, after Superman's ""death"" in Batman V Superman, this officer named Amanda Waller (who is quite possible the most hateable character is this whole dang thing) recruits some of the most dangerous criminals in the world (some of which are shown being beaten by Batman and The Flash) to fill in his role. The idea was so heavily criticized, that even the Lego Batman Movie made fun of it. Anyway, this group of baddies needs to fight this sorceress named Enchantress. She was pretty cool for her first 2 minutes, then she got dull really fast. She's also got this brother named Incubus, who is just about the most generic movie villain, ever. He also looks like Volga from Hyrule Warriors. Perhaps the most glaringly wrong thing about this film is Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker, which I think is a viable contender for worst book-to-screen portrayal of a character, in general. While Heath Ledger did set the bar pretty high, there wasn't enough of him here, and he felt like a mashup of other previous Jokers, with no consistency. It also has all this unnecessary sexualization, of characters both male and female. In some cases, notably Harley Quinn, we can expect that given the source material. But holy crap, I swear Harley's ass gets more screen time than the Joker. Some of the squad's members, namely Katana and Slipknot, are totally useless. All in all, this is easily the worst comic book movie in recent years. No matter how bad it is, we must never forget our deepest loss, brought on by this movie. R.I.P Slipknot. We'll never forget.",Suicide Squad

408,TheMysteriousReviewer,"One Flaw, The Movie is Not Great",6,31 August 2021,"Suicide Squad wasn't as great as I expected. Not exactly a bad film, but this doesn't really age well after five years. It can have some good aspects like some good visuals. Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn is quite entertaining. And it did have a great idea to be an exciting movie about a team of villains. But sadly, there can be others that does have a poor execution due to the story being predictable. There are instances it has given me questions than answers. The action isn't much awesome as promised. And most of the characters don't have their development. The most we have gotten is Deadshot. At least his backstory can be the most interesting of the film. In terms of my recommendation, I think it's safe to say there's another adult-oriented superhero themed movie that came out the same year I think it's best to stick with. Deadpool. This not only also have great visuals, but has a much better execution as an action comedy. But if you want to watch this movie anyway, I would set my expectations low for it. Well hey, at least there's Birds of Prey and another Suicide Squad that just came out this year. And maybe they'll be better.",Suicide Squad
409,Oberrated,Average at best. Entertaining but problems production wise,6,8 August 2016,"The Good: The film is entertaining, no doubt about it. The comedy hits well, for the most part, and the action is satisfying. The actors and actresses did well in their respective parts, some more shocking than others (i.e. Jai Courtney as Boomerang). While on the topic of characters, for me, Jared Leto as Joker was fantastic to me. Although he had very limited screen time, I was more than satisfied with his performance. He was weird and uncomfortable to watch and it worked for me. I feel that if he had a role in a feature length film as the villain, he would impress even more-so than he has done for some viewers. Another fantastic performance lies within Will Smith as Deadshot. While he easily steals the show, Deadshot/Will Smith commanded attention with almost every word and action. Lastly, among notable characters for me, Diablo/Jay Hernandez was great for me.The Bad: So while most of the good was within the performances and entertainment spectrum, a majority of the bad lies within production, writing, and overall the creative direction. The film was re-shot for more comedy to be inserted into the film. With this knowledge and now viewing the movie, the comedy that was present felt unnecessary at times. Many lines fell flat for me and could surely have been done without... A large amount of criticism with 'Suicide Squad' was about the amount of flashbacks seen. I would have to agree. Although some were most certainly entertaining, others felt pointless... The soundtrack created issues for me as well. Far too often were sequences flooded with mainstream music and not just one song, but followed up by another and even maybe another. A friend of mine, Shawn, said something which describes it perfectly as, ""It felt like watching a music video at times."" I believe in letting a film tell itself. Music far too often drowns out the moment you are watching in order to increase dramatics. 'Suicide Squad' fell victim to this concept... All in all, the film felt rushed. There are reports out there stating the production was rushed itself, so who knows. At the end of the day, while it was plenty of fun and it was entertaining with great performances; the underlying issues drown out sheer entertainment, especially with the direction DC is trying to pursue. 'Suicide Squad' is an ""alright"" flick for me but better than 'Batman Vs. Superman', and that is a victory for me and my desire to enjoy a DC film.",Suicide Squad

Always cool, always real. Then, the Joker. I am a huge fan of Heath, and I thought that Leto did a great job in his role of the Joker. Pity that the script is so bad and that the direction of the movie is awful, because the Joker hardly appears in the movie. And enough about that WB decided to cut parts with the Joker. The fault is the director's, not WB. The music is great. And the beginning of the movie is great. But after that, it just falls apart.

413,Nomad007,Ok movie that was jacked up just to get PG13,4,21 October 2019,"This could have been a great movie but the problem is that they insisted that they get a PG13 movie. They wanted a ""family"" movie. Nothing about the context of this movie fits into a family movie. If your familiar with the original backstory for the characters in the movie it would have been a very dark, black, and HARD R rating at best. There was loads of R rated footage shot but the director always intended for the movie to be a PG13 movie at most, and the studio forced an even softer PG13 rating for there. They think they'll get a wider audience and more ticket sales with a softer rating but it has been proven time and again that harder rated superhero movies actually do better. You want say that Marvel / Disney doesn't do R and they sell a ton of tickets. But Marvel kills WAY more people than DC, they just don't use language or show blood. Beside DC has ALWAYS been darker, and dare I say more realistic. The problem with Suicide Squad is from the start they were more insistent in getting a PG13 rating and toning evening down so much that even a prime time broadcast TV show shows more than Suicide Squad. Even the (unrated) ""Extended Release"" is basically still PG13 and it STILL strips all the life and story out of the movie and leaves it a confused, disjointed, mess of a movie. All the needed footage to make this an 8 or 9 out of 10 was shot and all we can HOPE is they make a fan version of this, since even the director was more concerned about the MPAA rating than telling an authentic story. Even the closing music on the unrated extended release has been censored! Why even use that music to begin with then. It's so obvious what they're saying when even edit it, for credit music, on an unrated version. Why? This is a dark story, that is even darker in its original form; and they insisted in watering it down to try and offend the least amount of people possible. You just pissed off all the people that love the original characters and story. And the goody goody people people are still offended because it's still not family enough and they know what you were editing out anyway. So you're left with a 6/10 movie that could have been 8+/10. Here's hopes the sequel which is taking 4 years for what reasons isn't done the wrong way again, for the same wrong reasons. I can easily saying the studio won't give you enough budget for the sequel because the first film didn't do well enough. Why.

It has a brown and yellow tinted to it and there's absolutely no interesting cinematography. Every shot feels boring.Amanda Waller is a freakin' idiot thinking using bad guys is a good idea. And she sees the best security to look after the Enchantress is one guy. And I thought Dawn of Justice was bad...",Suicide Squad
418,McFrogg,Directed by The Joker,2,17 June 2017,"Suicide Squad aka We're The Bad Guys is almost as bad as Batman v Superman. Nothing in this movie makes any darn sense...I watched it with an open mind, but it's impossible to enjoy this movie, or care about any of the characters. If Batman v Superman can be compared to sleep paralysis, Suicide Squad is what happens when you eat one of the strange mushrooms that grow in the woods. What a weird, Transformers 3-ish movie! The only thing that's missing from the movie is Shia LaBeouf.This movie could have been good. Even though it's a movie about fictional comic book characters, they could have used those characters to explore stuff like the cruel treatment of prisoners in the US, corruption, redemption, forgiveness etc. There's bits and pieces of that sprinkled throughout the movie, but most of the time it's about boring slow motion fight scenes, Harley Quinn's buttocks and really bad jokes.The best part is when Harley Quinn imagines herself living a normal life with the Joker. It's really sad that they wasted a scene like that in a terrible movie like this...Imagine if someone made a movie like that, where one of the villains actually managed to change. That would truly be something new and original in a comic book movie. Joker/Two- Face/Killer Croc gives Batman a message to meet him at the abandoned toy factory/bell tower. We expect a big, violent fight scene, but instead, the villain breaks down and cries. I'm not against action and fight scenes...but modern superhero movies brag about how they're for grownups, grounded in reality and all that stuff, yet everything is solved by punching people in the face. It's no different than any of the old serials (which I love)...the only difference is better costumes, nihilism and half-naked ladies. Why not try something new instead?The writing is terrible...it's embarrassing. It made me blush. The choice of music (Eminem, Queen, Ozzy Osbourne) is bizarre. The music seems out of place. None of the characters are convincing. The dancing Enchantress is probably one of the worst things ever in a comic book movie. It's almost as bad as Batman's rubber butt in Schumacher's homoerotic Batman movies. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be funny or serious, but it is beyond ridiculous.Just read or watch ""Mad Love"" instead. It's a better Batman/Harley Quinn and Joker story.",Suicide Squad
419,hamidullahgenc,DC Presented The Story Wrongfully...,8,2 January 2017,"The producers and writers could have thought that this could be a very good TV Series about a group of ""bad people"" trying to find their way by communicating with each other, other than blowing up places or killing random people just for the audience... Like ""The Breakfast Club""... We'd call it ""Narrations of Suicide"". Maybe. Then, as the season develops episode after episode, the conflict would arise... Deal with it!..Let us say it first; this movie could have been better in many ways. First; it has so great a cast that had the screenwriters written a worse dialogue the cast could have a way to make it seem less horrible. Oh what? This is exactly what happened in the movie!.. DC writers did a kindergarten-kind of an introduction for nearly every one of the characters while disrespecting the ""Slipknot"". So, it was obvious that he is to be killed immediately while deemed unimportant for the narrative. This is sloppy. One could ask: ""so why have you watched the extended version, then?"" That is not important. The short version has manifest defects too. So, this is the time we move on to the second level:The writers tried only to present how ""evil / graceless"" each character is, therefore they did not have time to reveal a clever plot for the movie:The usual kind of, ""left-alone-God(s)' / Goddess(es)'-wrath-to-be- brought-upon-infidels"" revealing plot. The usual kind of ""hopeless-enough-to-shake-hands-with-evil(s)"" attitude.The usual kind of ""all happens for / against U.S. of A."" story line.The usual kind of ""nervous characters messing with each other by a threadbare jokes only to get along afterwards"" options.The usual kind of ""aberration of characters for better or worse."" 1-Remember Deadshot; he has some humanity left in him, right. And he was injected with repentance by his innocent daughter. But we don't see his ""internalization process"" during the movie. Next minute, he is talking biblical...)2- Remember Harley Quinn; she is supposed to be beyond insane as she seems unpredictable to the fullest in the first half of the movie. Later on, she suddenly becomes friendly and acts off-the-script ""for love."" One could remind us of her love for the Joker. But hey, she is the ""Holy Craziness.""I could go on with ""the usual(s)"". But I won't. No reason. Yeah. Maybe I cannot see more. Or maybe I am just tired. Sorry. (I am the worst!)So... Most importantly, they represent the Batman as an incompetent, ineffective, clueless-of-the-developments-in-his-city kind of a hero which he is not supposed to be. He is the helper of justice. Not a businessman! Yep!Let's see another good point: The idea that the ""bad guys / villains"" are inclined to being better persons during their journey is so well a thought and so good an example for the world we live in!.. We should spread good tidings not horrors!.. Thank you, D.C. for this!.. I hope you exercise it better the next time!P.S.: They picked good songs for the movie, okay. The visuals are fine. They surely depicted the D.C. universe different than the Marvel as D.C. is darker. This is better than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice as Suicide Squad has less ""aimlessness"".Margot Robbie sure plays perfectly! But they need not to objectify her to gain more viewers. Nudity often comes not ""artistic."" Stop it guys.For Will Smith... He is the actor to play your ""lonely hero"" movies. He is astonishing once again!I will give this movie a ""7,3"" as it is clearly better than ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" and its equals. Yep.Let's see what The Gracious Koran says on the matter in the 52th Verse of the 11th Chapter called Hud (who is a Prophet in Islam):""And, O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, then turn unto Him repentant; He will cause the sky to rain abundance on you, and He will increase you in strength unto your strength; and turn not your backs as sinners.""",Suicide Squad
420,DVR_Brale,Not entertaining but irritating,4,5 August 2016,"I expected this to be a fun movie. Most people have found it as such. But for some reason I couldn't help myself not to yawn. Suicide Squad disappointed me in every aspect.I had seen Ayers' Fury a few days before I saw SS. I immediately realized that SS is probably going to be full of clichés just as Fury (which is a much more serious movie) is. Using clichés is the easiest way to make a two hour long movie when you have a terrible plot. Unfortunately, Ayer took this cowardly way and ruined what could've been a good movie.Nowhere was the movie even able to entertain me or make me laugh. But it did a good job when it comes to irritating me. Margot Robbie just goes all over the place. She's the bait to attract horny fifteen year old boys to see the movie. Jared Leto delivered a solid performance; but Joker he impersonates was more a metro, semi-female character than a villain. Will Smith delivered just what I expected him to deliver - a cool performance as a leader of the squad. Other characters are just forgettable.Camera work is also done poorly. A more shaky camera would've been a lot better. All the action is very generic: there are no stunts or moves we haven't seen a million times before. And this I find as the biggest knock down. Having ""cool"" characters will not compensate for poor action and moves.Poorly done action, almost not existing plot, bad camera work and easily forgettable characters make a bad movie.Don't waste your time and money on this one. Ignore the hype. You're not going to see anything you haven't seen before.",Suicide Squad
421,sujanfaster,Why So Serious?,8,16 August 2016,"I can't seem to quite get the hate that is going on for the DC films this summer. First Dawn of Justice and now this. Both have been slammed by critics and fans alike. In fact I found both of them pretty good. Although Suicide Squad is very different from Dawn of Justice in terms of its approach to the Justice League build up. The problem with Suicide Squad is the time and screenspace. With so many characters and so little time the movie starts off as if from the middle. The characters are introduced in a hurry and they are sent on a mission unprepared (just like the script). The concept of 'preparing for the war' is used as a reason yet again as it was in Dawn of Justice. There isn't much to say anything about the story as it is very little. It is better to go on about each and every characters which makes more sense.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller: Has a powerful role. But mostly unclear about what her purpose is. Many questions remain on her actions by the end of this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn: Undoubtedly the showstealer but most of you would know it anyway. But lack of clarity at times makes her role a bit confusing. Joel Kinnaman as Colonel Rick Flag: Apt and brilliant. Cara Delevingne: An important role as Enchantress for this young model, although she gives her best the role is not so well written. Jai Courntey and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Booomerang and Killer Croc respectively: Mainly cast to up the humor part and they do well. Jay Hernandez as Diablo: Surprisingly good. One of the best characters of the movie, hardly has any line but makes maximum impact. Scott Eastwood as Lieutenant GQ Edwards: Wasted as a sidekick to colonel Rick Flag. Unable to see much of his acting abilities. Jared Leto as The Joker: Amazing. Unfortunately we hardly see much of him in this part. Hoping to see more in the Batman or next Suicide Squad. and last but not the least Will Smith as Deadshot: Will Smith gets everything right from Humor to making sense in this chaotic of a film. I was worried that he might get lost in the flurry of other characters, but the script has given him much importance and he does fit in well.I haven't read any comic books so I am not sure if this will disappoint comic book fans but this Suicide Squad is definitely a different DC movie in the recent years. Subtle is the last world you should be looking for if you want to say something about this movie. Watch Suicide Squad for all the fun and antics.",Suicide Squad
422,darrell-23715,Its a good film but....,7,30 April 2020,"This could of been a really excellent film but they cast Jared Leto into the film and that ruined it.

423,TheMovonka,Rise of the good Villains,7,19 August 2016,"Let's face it, many critics have been published splitting the community of movie lovers and DC fans in many fractions. So I want to join those appreciated colleagues, who tried to give you an honest feedback of Suicide Squad and its story of really bad guys who can do something good.As neither a DC nor Marvel hardcore fan, nor more than a mainstream comic book reader, I was still as thrilled as many with the promising picture orchestration the various trailers showed us. A new set of remarkable characters in the dark universe of Man of Steel and Co should entertain the wannabe super villain in us, who wants to cheer for the bad but cool guys. The new interpretation of the Joker alone, kept us on the edge of the seat in awaiting the best movie experience ever. Well, here we have the problemthe hype.As always, expectations were tremendously high and people set unreachable hopes into the follow up after a disappointing Batman vs Superman. People expected the Joker to be a main character and a legendary movie to be created. I tell you the truth, if you leave that away, the movie is really good.In a short living action flick, with a really innovative compilation of pictures and soundtrack, the viewer experiences a straight origin story of a team of strange but somehow likable guys. From the famous crazy Joker sidekick Harley Quinn, over the human reptile Killer Croc, to Will Smith as Deadshot, we see a more or less loose newly created team growing together to kick some  well whatever the henchmen are. Additionally we see guest characters to make the DC universe more believable like the Joker, Batman or the Flash. To be honest, of course the story is fast pacing and not much individual origin story of the main characters is told. Yes the dialogues and story line has gaps, highs and lows and yes I understand that people wanted more of the Joker. BUT if you are open minded, the balance of all the issues with the focus on action, entertainment and fun will turn out as absolutely fine for the level a comic book movie may have. The Joker as side character has much more screen time than in most critics stated, as well as the story does not give so many mistake possibilities as reviewed mostly. For sure, the reason for that is the simplicity behind the movie, which could have a deeper story, as well as not all scene cuts were done very clever. Still the two hours will run by and keep you smiling. Please try to be forgiving for the fact, that maybe Harley Quinns relationship with the Joker is misplaced as too romantic, Deadshot is too focused on his daughter or how could this squad ever stop Superman if each of them can be hold back by five police men with a Taser Gun. As a result you see an awesome summer movie, which my twelve year old me can recommend with peace of conscience.In short, better than reviewed most of the time. Not the best movie or story, but a great spectacle and show!",Suicide Squad
424,freewillyfan,Suicide Squad,5,9 November 2019,"Suicide Squad is a pretty boring film in my opinion. Will Smith and Margret Robbie were really good and the two best characters. It didn't find it funny, the action was entertaining enough and the plot was a pretty good premise. The villain was vary bad. Most characters were forgettable and the Joker was very disappointing. In my opinion this is the worst DCEU film at the moment.4.6/10",Suicide Squad
425,trevor-82944,"A Chaotic Catastrophe, But Harley is Hot.",4,5 August 2016,"We all know the history of Suicide Squad's production. Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club) went through meticulous preparation for his role as the Joker, including mailing a live rat to his on screen girlfriend, Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street). Women all over were cosplaying as Harley Quinn months before this film even was completed. A group of fans formed a petition to shut down RottenTomatoes after critics gave it a 35% rating only three days before its release. So now, it's time to ask: was it worth all the hullabaloo?Essentially, in this first ever villain ensemble picture, these imprisoned denizens of the law are temporarily released from their cells for a top secret mission. The government is already worried of another Superman coming to earth, so they have no other options besides rely on these metahumans to stop a typical extra-dimensional villain from creating yet another doomsday over the world. If they succeed, they get ten years off their prison sentence. If they fail, they die.The result is an edgier version of Guardians of the Galaxy, except without the fun, fascinating imagery, impressive CGI, or anything else that makes this stand out as its own entity. Like any other action movie these days, it resorts to constant close-up motion sickness in all the action scenes, overusing noisy colors and upbeat pop music to add flavor. The entire first forty minutes is a meticulous bore to manage through, as it overuses backstory exposition and flashback on every single character. And yes, I do mean every single one. Anyways, after this torturous, lengthy intro, the movie finally gets started with the villains gearing up for their mission under the supervision of the CIA. It's a pretty wild ride if you are an expert at keeping track of ten different subplots from one-dimensional characters fighting for the audience's attention.The team is not full of the biggest failures known to mankind, but they're not going to be remembered within an hour after the first meeting. From what I remembered, there was a masked Japanese warrior named Katana (Karen Fukuhara) whose husband is trapped in her sword. There was also an offensive Australian stereotype named Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) who exists for no reason besides comic relief. Then there was Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who does next to nothing memorable besides being rolled in a restraining harness like Hannibal Lecter. Then there was the skeleton-tatted El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), who stands out with his surprisingly tragic backstory. Then there was the governmental supervisor of the squad (Viola Davis) who likes to control them as their god.The squad does have a couple of redeeming members who want something out of their mission. El Diablo is certainly one, but the rogue gunman Deadshot (Will Smith) makes one of the film's greater impressions. Now, it's not to say that Will Smith was any good in the role, because he honestly does exactly the same routine as all his 90's roles. Even his character's backstory feels clichéd to Smith's type of character. He has a daughter, you see, and she does not approve of his murderous lifestyle. She even puts her own life at risk to stop her father from killing anyone else. It feels pretty sweet, but haven't we seen this before?Now as for Jared Leto's highly anticipated performance as the Joker, I hate to break it to you: he let me down. With all we have heard about what he did to prepare for his role to make it his own, the crew barely gives him any useful material to work off of. The closest thing to disturbing he gets to is laughing like a pedophile inside a circle of knives.Everyone thought he would be the best part of the movie, but you know what was the best part? Not the Joker, but the Joker's lil' monster. Margot Robbie is both deliciously seductive and delightfully psychotic as Harley Quinn, balancing that behavior with a girly innocence to generate a believable romance with the clown prince of crime. She has the only flashbacks that I was okay with seeing, particularly one where she willfully jumps into a vat of chemicals for a twisted make-out session with her beau. Sure, she may have been a bit too sexualized for what her character called for, but I would have much preferred her to be the sole main character than to have five different leads.We've never seen anything quite like this movie, and I'm sure this will not be the last supervillain ensemble picture. I'm sure that the crimes that Suicide Squad has committed on storytelling will not remain in the public's memories, but I already presume a long and successful screen career for the fresh Margot Robbie.",Suicide Squad

They got the basics down pretty well here. And the actors plating the Squad each do a tremendous job. While Margret Robie Is fantastic Eye Candy and Her Harley Quinn is the scene stealer of the movie the focus Should be put on will Smith as Floyd Lawton AKA Deadshot. Smith gives us a Deadshot without conscience or ethics except one. The love of his daughter. after a wonderful scene where Batman arrests him Deadshot becomes the head and soul of The Squad and Harley its Heart.The plot is simple There is a menace the super heroes can't handle it as its a killing mission. Assemble a Squad of Killers Mercs Freaks and a Hard Assed Colonel to go save the world. Fail to do so They Die by getting the bombs implanted in their heads blowing. Along the way this group of psychs learn to function as a team and finally as friends. And while they refuse to admit it. They become heroes.To me as a long time reader of John Ostrander's Suicide Squad run from the mid 80s This movie takes a lot from that run . And that alone is worth the price of the ticket.nicely paced good solid acting and lots of surprises makes this the summer movie of the year.,Suicide Squad
428,adamsmith-51004,"""Oh, I'm not gonna kill you... I'm just gonna hurt you really, really bad.""",6,16 April 2021,"The film features a variety of DC villains and anti-heroes, including Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), the Joker (Jared Leto), and Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). There are also characters such as Katana, Killer Croc, and Captain Boomerang in supporting roles. With this many characters, you'd hope that they all receive an equal amount of attention. Unfortunately, some characters fare better than others.Deadshot's arc is fairly uncomplicated; he's an assassin fallen on hard times, and he wants to redeem himself in order to be a better father to his daughter. Diablo is the only team member who's not outright evil, and he just wants to redeem mistakes he's made in the past. Joel Kinnaman gives a well-enough performance as Rick Flag, who is in a relationship with Cara Delevingne's Enchantress.Margot Robbie absolutely nails Harley Quinn. She perfectly toes the line between being delightfully crazy and insane. She gets some of the best lines in the movie, a favourite of mine being about ""voices in her head"" early on. Her colorful personality brings a much-needed dose of levity to the too-grim DCEU.Unfortunately, Harley's appeal doesn't extend to Jared Leto's Joker. The biggest issue is that he doesn't have nearly as much screen-time as the previews would have you believe. With that in mind, Leto doesn't have as much time to make an impact as Jack Nicholson and the late Heath Ledger did. It feels odd to have a new Joker who's just....there. I understand not wanting to overshadow newer characters, but at least give him a scene amounting to ""Why so serious?"" Also, his ""gangster"" look (complete with grilled teeth) is just off-putting. It feels like the movie is trying too hard to be ""edgy.""Another big issue with Suicide Squad is the obvious studio meddling. After BvS performed worse than expected, Warner Bros. Ordered reshoots 5 months before the movie came out to lighten up the tone, resulting in rough editing. For example, during one scene, we see Harley standing up in one shot, but in the very next shot, she's sitting down. Whoever edited the movie didn't do a very good job.Suicide Squad is a likable movie, but it's also pretty average compared to other superhero movies that are coming out there these days. You should watch it for yourself to see what you think, but I hope this review lets you know what you're in for.",Suicide Squad

430,StregaAsuka,DC is almost there,6,4 June 2017,"Reason one to watch this movie: just for the fun of it!! The movie is really entertaining and has good humor scenes. But, if you are looking for another Marvel movie, this is not it. This is DC, and it's time that people are aware of it, although comparisons are in order, as always. The movie has rhythm and good action scenes, but at some times the plot is weak, there is nothing new there that could be given to the audience. Nonetheless, that doesn't mean that you won't enjoy it, because you do. And if you didn't like BvS, you will probably like this one better as the story flows faster and is less darker.Reason two: Harley Quinn. Maybe the most popular character in the movie; even more than the Joker, who by the way, is NOT a part of the squad, so don't expect him to appear that much in the movie. She is his girlfriend, and probably she is even crazier than him. Every time that we hear Margot Robbie speak, she really steals the show; she is simply the best with her performance of the crazy girlfriend. One cannot help themselves to look for more information about her and check the Batman animated movies (guilty here).Reason three: the music. The soundtrack is one of the best things about this movie. Old known songs, and not so old, that will transport you to another time while you enjoy the action in the movie. The best example of it the first movie trailer, which got us hooked since the first second. If there was an Oscar category for trailers, this one would definitely take it home.",Suicide Squad
431,cheighlee,Phantom Menacing Syndrome again,4,9 August 2016,"I would like to not talk about drama clouding this movie but it is unavoidable, it just is. So I'll cover that first and then go to the movie directly. RT and score aggregators should usually be considered as guide only and not as the final sentence of movie's success/goodness. That being said, I've watched couple of (too) positive reviews of Suicide Squad, for example Kevin Smith's and Angry Joe's, and I had to think about few things and ask some hard questions:1. Have we really saw the same movie? Even if it wasn't pile of garbage, it still doesn't warrant that much praise.2. ""This one is for the fans, not the critics"" bull. In 2016, have we forgotten the crucial role of the critics? And I mean really thoughtful ones, not all, but people that really know what they're doing when they're criticizing a movie, not just some random but loud fanboys. If the director has to defend his movie like that, you can bet there is something fishy going on. Do you (DC) think your fans are idiots? Critics mainly pointed out the problems that maybe a DC fan(atic) would not be able to because they're ""too much of a fan"" to admit to themselves that this movie was trash (Phantom Menace Syndrome)? I mean, yeah, movie references a bunch of stuff, we get to see a lot of new stuff, never seen before in live action but it doesn't mean it's good. Is the bar so low that if the movie just references stuff and has easter eggs aplenty, no matter the actual content and quality and substance, is a great (or just - good) movie? No, people, no. References for the sake of references does not equal quality. Also, why do you regard it as ""Hot Topic goes alive"" as a good thing?3. I am a DC fan and I think this movie is garbage. Now what? ""Well you're not A TRUE fan!"". Well you're wrong, I'm a decades long fan that is sad that the characters and the stories he love are adapted so poorly to the point of ruination and that I'll have to wait next wave of DC reboots to enjoy them. Because this as it is now is just fan maltreatment. Three movies in and DC just can't get it right.I don't want to write about this anymore, let's go over the movie quickly.Is it any good? No. But it's not a total catastrophe as well, because there is a good movie somewhere in there. Only the direction, editing and the script itself are bad.Yes, the cool elements are there, the characters mainly but if you have all the toys and you don't do anything meaningful with them, what's the point of them then?Movie has no stakes, editing is horrible and there's a fu_kton of cringe moments. Joker is disappointing at the best and the visual style of him is least of the problems he has as a character. Despite some good performances from the cast, it does not outweigh the sum of other bad parts. So much potential and some much of it wasted. If you really believe in that ""this is for the fans"" speech, and you think this movie is awesome there's really nothing I can say to make you think a bit otherwise.",Suicide Squad
432,NDbportmanfan,"A Movie that is Not Very Memorable, but Still Leaves Me Excited for a Possible Sequel",4,7 August 2016,"This is by no means a bad movie but the amount of cringe is ever present in the first Suicide Squad movie. The leading candidates for this would have to be Killer Croc (a very generic and sometimes stereotypical character) and Rick Flagg. Every line Croc said left me shaking my head wondering who approved this. Rick Flagg and of course Deadshot continually like an old record kept informing me that their ""the bad guys"". I heard you the first time no need to repeat the main idea of the story every 5 minutes. The dialogue tried to hard to be funny. I did find myself laughing a number of times, but overall I started to get annoyed by the whole thing, much like I do with Marvel. The other annoyances I found were at the beginning where there was to much jumping around to each character in short spurts. There probably isn't a good way to show 5 origins in 15 minutes so they could have spread the flashbacks over the course of the movie. Many of the songs felt unnecessary or just didn't belong which took me out of the moment. As for the overall story, I felt they played it to safe and made it feel to generic. I think that can be attributed to the backlash of BvS for having too much story in one movie. All I got was the basic idea of the Task Force X program, which is fine but they never really established the main relationship with Deadshot and Harley. Their chemistry keeps the team in proper check. Now this criticism could just be me but the final boss fight was too over the top for me. Why would the Squad's first mission be with one of the strongest characters in the DCU? They were not properly equipped to deal with that. I think they should have faced off with someone on their level as it would have been an easy victory and the movie could have focused more on character development.Now the positives of the movie. I think the performances by Deadshot, Harley, and El Diablo really make this movie. The conversations between these three didn't feel clichéd or anything of the sort. El Diablo's story arc was very entertaining so entertaining that I think he became my favorite character in the whole movie. The chemistry between Joker and Harley was the best part of the movie and its one of the few reasons I am semi-excited for another installment. The action in the movie was well shot and fun to watch. I believe the best scene with the squad took place in the bar; you really connect with these villains.Suicide Squad is a pretty meh movie. I didn't leave happy but nor did I walk away disappointed either. I will give it a pass since it was more of a set up movie to get to know the characters.",Suicide Squad

However, I believe the film has an amazing cast, great soundtrack, it felt like a comic book on the big screen, well acted performances, colorful, it's fun, funny, and it felt like the DC Cinematic Universe is actually starting to connect more naturally. I honestly don't understand all the negative reviews, and hate this film has been receiving. Honestly, I like it a hell of a lot more than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Out of all the actors and actresses so far in the DC Cinematic Universe, the cast in Suicide Squad is easily the best. Will Smith, as Deadshot is the most well rounded character, with back-story, character development, and screen time. If anything, I consider this the Will Smith movie a.k.a. Mister July a.k.a. Big Willy Style has his career comeback. I do agree with what some critics and fans are saying though. I believe Will Smith is the main character, because he is the biggest selling point for this movie. Also, at times I believe he was acting like Will Smith instead of the character Deadshot from the comics. Viola Davis completely owns the role of Waller. She really is mean, fearless, intelligent, determined and as Will Smith said to her in the film, gangsta. She dominates everyone she shares a scene with and makes them look ten times as small. I'd love to see her character come back in the future.""YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE CRAZY ONES."" Another standout is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. If you're not familiar with comic books and or the character. You should know that Margot Robbie had a ton of pressure on her taking on this role. If you go to any comic convention, there are literally many women dressed as Harley Quinn (That's why I like those conventions ha-ha). In my opinion, Robbie will satisfy fans, newcomers who may not know the characters, and moviegoers. Robbie manages to capture the spirit of Quinn from the animated series as well as the newer version from the comics while still making the character work for movie audiences. If you talk about Harley Quinn, you also have to talk about Jared Leto as Mister J a.k.a. The Clown Prince of Crime, better known as The Joker! Leto had to face even bigger expectations. I'll admit, when I first saw the picture of Jared Leto as The Joker I wasn't feeling all that strong about it. I literally said, ""He looks like what would happen if Lil Wayne and Marilyn Manson would have a baby together). Nevertheless, after seeing him here, Leto took on the role and I really feel like he delivered. His Joker brings a lot new to the character and is significantly different from the performances of Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Hamill. In my opinion, this Joker was a mix of various Jokers. Jared Leto's reminded me very much of the Joker from DC Comics The New 52 series Endgame story-line, Batman: The Killing Joke, Ledger, Nicholson, and the novel Joker by Brian Azzarello. Jared Leto is not trying to be Heath Ledger. He is trying to do something different, yet stay true to the character we love (or hate). I actually would love to see Jared Leto come back as The Joker. I heard many of his scenes were cut from the film, and personally, I'd love to see more. So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Suicide Squad. Even though the director David Ayer (screenwriter for Training Day, Director of End of Watch) mentioned he is not the biggest comic book fan, I believe he constructed a well-done comic book movie. It has a good cast, music, and it feels like a comic book movie. I believe this film would have been even better if it were rated R, not trying to be as funny, and kept the tone of the very first trailer we saw. It's not a perfect movie, but I personally enjoyed it. For those who didn't enjoy it. I'm sorry you were all let down, and hopefully you didn't lose all your faith in the DC Cinematic Universe. I believe that Suicide Squad earns a8/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. ""Stay evil doll face."" :)",Suicide Squad
435,charliep14,This movie is such a mess...,3,11 August 2016,"Where to start... Suicide Squad is a mess; you can feel the multiple rewrites, the three re-edits ('oh, Deadpool did well, we need more jokes.' 'Oh Batman vs Superman was panned by critics, we need to be like that' etc etc.) leaving this movie completely disjointed; all over the place. The multiple edits and re-shoots are physically visible in the movie - it takes you out of the film completely.I won't even mention the story - it's pointless. But story is never really what Suicide Squad is supposed to be about: The characters are. And this is one of the first major flaws of this movie: the characters are clearly separated into A grade - basically Will Smith, B Grade - Harley Quinn and then Z Grade: the rest of them. The Z Grades fight for 5% screen time and therefore become meaningless cannon fodder: they don't stand for anything, are completely undeveloped and thoroughly uninteresting. In certain cases they look bad (Killcroc) and are stupid clichés (Katana speaks Japanese and has a sword... ugh)Even Will Smith & Harley Quinn don't really work. They're supposed to be villains... they're not. There isn't a single thing bad Deadshot Will has done in this movie. This means that the entire premise of Suicide Squad doesn't stand: they're not bad guys! They don't do anything bad! And don't get me started on the villain: idiotic and over-powerful yet super easy to defeat...!Visually the movie is in the same vain as the recent DC offerings but...somewhat less impressive? The characters look off, the effects are super dark and underwhelming...the super hero abilities fall flat...Suicide Squad does have some redeeming qualities... but they are very few and far between and contingent on you liking the source material and the characters. Pass.",Suicide Squad
436,rchosen-193-5535,"Trailer was great, movie was terrible.",5,9 August 2016,"I haven't wrote a review here in at least 10 years now. Dusted off my account to do it because of this movie. This is SPOILER FREE review, so no worries.I don't usually complain about anything thats made into a movie from somewhere else. But this trailer REALLY made the movie look good. But it turned out to be pretty bad.They tried to fit a massive story into one small movie. It felt rushed and badly edited. Didn't really give you time to think about anything and no real character development. Mind you I know the story, but it didn't well how they put it on screen. Batman v Superman was better sadly. The Joker seems terrible. His tattoos were a bad idea as were the silver dental work and overall ""over board"" insane level. His persona not like the Joker we've seen so much in the past. It felt like Leto was trying to hard to make the Joker different. Harley wasn't to badly done. The rest of the people were close enough to their comic book selves.And I'm glad they tied in the other DC movies into this. Stay past the end credits to see why. The CGI was really nice in the movie, better then I thought it would be. I can tell though they reedited the movie like the said they did. Originally the movie did not have the music it did. Movie also felt all over the place at times. Thankfully as I said I know about the story, but I can see why many who don't know it would feel a bit lost and bored.Overall I'd say its a 5.5 out of 10. Its sad that this broke Guardians of the Galaxy's record in terms of money earned. All this goes to show you can't always go by a movies trailer. This is a rental at best.",Suicide Squad

438,sfinancing,Originally saw it in theater...,4,24 March 2017,"...and wasn't especially impressed. But hey, I went back and watched it again(for free this time) just to try with a hopefully unbiased eye. The relatively unbiased opinion is that if one looks at this simply as an summer blockbuster action flick it is at least okay. Biased first:Personally, thought Smith did a decent job with his character...not sure who that character was as it was not Deadshot...I enjoyed Robbie as Harley Quinn.Leto was interesting as Joker...not sure why Joker was in this movie.Pretty much the rest of the characters were forgettable throw-away.Unbiased:Weak plot.Mediocre to poor script.While there were a few humorous moments, mostly it fell flat.Decent special effects.OK sound track.Some big names.If they hadn't called it Suicide Squad I'd have given it a 5. Going into it familiar with the Suicide Squad I'd give it a 3.",Suicide Squad
439,fluturoj,Surprisingly-romantic,6,26 December 2016,"It was a surprise to me how much this movie was based on romance and on true mad love. I'll get to that later but as I said, I would have not expected a movie like this to be based on romance which I am not saying is bad thing, just that surprising which kind of makes the movie warm and stand out. The real-life link: let's get back to this idea of romance in the movie. Is there a love so strong that one would risk fighting a witch and see the end of the world just to save the other half, like Lieutenant GQ Edwards did for June Moone? Or is there a love so strong like Harley Quinn's love for the Joker so that one would go insane, get rid of humanity and sanity just to be accepted from the one one loves? Is there a love this strong in real life?The storytelling: Great. An interesting beginning by which all the characters are introduced. An enemy that makes the interesting idea come alive, a setback that prepares you for the grand finale and the grand finale. The story moves fast, is interesting and leaves no space for boredom. The character development: poor. The only character that shows a slight development is that of Headshot but considering that he was never the bad guy, the softness in him due to his daughter and his leadership do not come as a surprise, are bot touching and do not go far. With joker's believed death, there was space for Harley Quinn's character to develop-either become better or worse. How is it plausible that someone who loves so much as Harley does, is so less affected by the death of the one she loves. I think the movie tried to save El Diablo as the one character who develops in the end and touches the audience-poorly done since his story was exactly as expected. One major factor when it comes to characters is how there was no reasonable situation that created a bond between the squad. There was nothing that made the squad a team and yet someone how in the end they became friends. Why? In general an interesting action movie, but it does not go beyond that.",Suicide Squad
440,Gerardrobertson61,Gave Up Half Way Through,2,28 October 2019,"This was really a terrible movie, I got to the last 65 minutes hoping it would get better but I just could not bring myself to finish this load of crap.
Didn't really understand the whole story-line, Jared Leto's Joker was the worst I have ever seen, admittingly, after Heath Ledger, it would be extremely difficult to portray the Joker (I haven't yet seen The Joker) so this opion may change after next week.
Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn was passable, but she didn't have the voice I expected from Harley, that high pitched ""Mr J"" that Arleen Sorkin did so well in The Animated Series.
The other support characters are pretty ordinary.
Not a great movie, give this one a mess.",Suicide Squad
441,paradux,Best Harley Quinn ever!,7,3 April 2017,"With your kind permission, will break the review down as follows: 1. The Story.Ugh! Near as I can tell, this has something to do with a government hack anticipating the need for a Dirty Dozen squad to replace Superman in an emergency and then the emergency turns out to be one of her very own making? Joss Whedon is not losing sleep over this writing team.2. The Motivation.Money, of course. The trend in Superhero films is backwards and bizarro, so this is an excuse to dust out the characters in the DC library who never get screen time and get the coins rolling. Same thing Marvel does.3. The Payoff.The film (saw the extended cut) is not bad. The lead reviewer who said it was worse than Superman Vs. Batman may possibly have misplaced his sense of humor. But the real payoff is the best live Quinn (played by Margot Robb) ever! Quinn has always been the perfect male fantasy that everyone else missed -- drop dead gorgeous, nutty as a fruitcake, and with a core of sweetness. Worth watching just for that.",Suicide Squad
442,cafesmitty,It did its job to entertain,7,10 August 2016,"I think ultra fans will hate this film but I thought the film was entertaining. You sort of going to have to do you homework a bit if you don't know who these guys are. They are DC villains and since the rise of the anti-hero, DC decided that it would be fun to through a ""what if"" scenario. What if the villain becomes the hero and thus the Suicide Squad, named so because the government wouldn't care if they die. The movie does a brief introductions to each villain and assumes that the audience knows who they are.. and if you don't, if may be confusing. After that brief intro the movie just jumps right into it. Between the intro and ""the mission"".. there is a giant plot (or lack of plot) hole. Will Smith is the unofficial leader of the bad guys and Will Smith plays Will Smith in all his movies. Listen its not a clean movie. It is, truly like a live issue of a comic book. Lots of action. i wasn't bored. A lot of the other villains (outside of DeadShot and Harley Quinn) are kind of glossed over. Maybe I like it because Batman vs Superman was long and boring. This was short and to the point. If you want more, see another movie.",Suicide Squad
443,hthbrr2,Great movie for showing how bad a hyped movie can be.,1,21 November 2016,"I hope this is a lesson to people, anytime a movie is over hyped it's gonna be bad.Let me explain. Movies have a budget, a focus if you will. Depending on how they want the move to turn out. Just like if you are cooking a meal. If you use cheap ingredients in a dish, it will taste like bland sh!t. If you use only the best, you will most likely have a mouth watering meal.Let's see where they spent the money. They got a cheap director. Who wrote and directed! Did they get some kind of discount there? Lol. Next they hired basically nobodies. Except Will Smith and Jared Leto I guess. Viola Davis is an of the moment actor. People like her from TV so throw her in there. And the piece of objectified meat Margot Robbie.Now in order to get people to buy faulty products they have to be tricked some how. Why not just make a good product that sells itself? Well not all people are talented enough to make a good product to begin with. So they will advertise some food product as being the 'best' 'delicious' 'mouthwatering' when in reality it is none of these things. Why not spend the money to hire better chefs? Or in this movie's case hire better people to make it? What they did was focus the money on the advertising. It's how I knew right away the movie was gonna be cr@p. The trailer looked great, but it made no sense. And as I watched the movie it was painfully obvious they filmed it to make a deceptive trailer. Certain scenes that were in the trailer made NO SENSE in the movie. Just none.Reminded me of the new Star Trek movie. Advertisements: ""Best movie ever."" My thoughts: ""Oh so it's cr@p.""If something is good people, PEOPLE will talk about, word of mouth. Don't believe the media mouth piece. Don't believe the slick advertisements. The trailer is good does not equate to it's good movie. Really these people need to be sued for false advertising at this point. The trailer was 90% Joker and Harely. When they are BARELY in the movie. I think it's so bad that ALL of their scenes in the movie are used in the trailer just about. LOLOh to the movie it's self now. The plot makes no sense. No sane character motivations. And the 'well they are just crazy' excuse does not apply. WHY did Harely fall for Joker? Why is the Aussie guy the way he is? Why does the fire guy not want to kill, who is that random Asian chick? I mean she literally WALKED onto the movie. ""Hey here is a random Asian women, her sword traps souls kbye."" What? Even with 3 members of the squad just being shoved in there. They still did not explain back story of the other members. Dead shot has a daughter, and? What else, crocodile guy....wait no backstory. Umm, drawing a real blank here guys.Yeah so I hope that people learn that when a movie is hyped to he11 as 'the best movie ever' you can just see right through it and see it's bulls!t. Great movie to teach people this important lesson. I try to see the good in everything. So there it is. A cautionary tale.",Suicide Squad
444,Wirxaw,Suicide Mess.,4,19 August 2016,"Or ""Antihero gone wrong."" Or maybe ""Direct-to-TV movie on the big screen"". It's like watching some Thor: The Dark World - you don't know what the bloody actual duck is going on. Everything is so faceless, everything is so stretched out... but at least there it kind of looked like a superhero movie.This thing... I think this should actually be Ghosbusters 3, with Gozer coming back. Because, seriously, there was nothing superhero here. I know it's about metahumans and stuff, but damn, if Jeremy Renner can pull it off(much less Deadpool) - why can't a whole freaking squad?Speaking of the squad - it's laughable. Over 50% of the people probably went to see the movie just to look at Margot Robbie's underwear. She acted well, granted, but was probably the biggest eye candy there is. Is that how she really is in comics? I know Black Widow is blamed for that reason exactly, but she is at least in a full leather suit and has quite a character. Harley's character is like a punchline without a joke. She has a couple of bullying scenes, but instead of being a strong, ferocious fighter, she is... just being there for the shots. She narrates, gets the shots, and that's it.Deadshot, to be honest, does not need to be played by Smith. Really, the amount of character and the amount of action he had - could've been easily done by any black Marvel actor. Why would I say it... oh, right, because they've already had more character, so it's done. I admit, I don't like Smith, he is overpaid and over-hyped. But if he can do things, like the original Independence Day or other older movies - he does it. Here he just... makes a few faces occasionally. And delivers a few lines of forced dialogue. I don't see why people think he saves the movie. He is written, sort of, but he gets too much screen time for no good reason. He is like the leader against all common sense, a cute and cuddly assassin, who is suddenly legit. One would think an assassin, who can whack-talk a buyer into 2$mil salaries - would've done a few jobs and disappeared, just stolen his daughter for f's sake and lived in a mansion somewhere remote. No, he needs to be kind of Ant Man, who is struggling to get a job in Baskin Robbins.Rick Flag is... yawn. Anyone watched Captain Phillips? Now there's the SEAL Leader. Just a leader of a spec-ops team created to get -it done. Almost R. Lee Ermey style. Here we have a pussy-whipped American hero, who... Do I really need to continue?That's about it. Diablo is DC's Quicksilver. A character sort of there just to die stupidly in the end. Katana doesn't do anything(except ridicule the Japanese culture, down to the point of harakiri). Jay Courtney is, as always, wasting screen time. Killer Croc's biggest performance in the movie was the reveal that he is black. And why exactly did they add Slipknot? To show that Jay is an a-hole? It's funny, with the speed of his escape, a child could gun him down, but he needed to be made an example...As for the Joker... well, I kind of liked him. He tried. Overacted, perhaps, but at least he tried to get to the comics' level. Unfortunately, there is a thin line between smart and crazy, and Leto went with full on crazy. We've had a clown of the nineties. We've had an unnerving terrorist of Nolan. And in the comics, he looked crazy, but he was ultimately sinister. Here he just... kinda... makes faces, does crazy things... He serves as an exposition, and not just as an exposition, but more like a wrong advertisement. Like a dentist's drilling tool in the toothpaste ad. Looks good, but leaves an aftertaste... Still, as any crazy character - at least crazy is guaranteed to have character, and Leto gets a credit for trying.Now for the bad guys. Well, they pop out of out nowhere. Here's Enchantress, deciding to do... uhm... a little bit of night walking, which conveniently coincides with the anti-heroes first class. Her brother is that kind of invulnerable almighty guy that will die, because of something stupid. Like Apocalypse. And she is practically Azazel+Scarlet Witch, but all she does is a bit of choreography for the camera, and then she gets fooled like a troll in the first Hobbit movie. She can read their minds, see them through the walls, but she can't predict the most obvious deception? Who wrote that again? Oh, right, that was not about her, it was about Harley, she had to do something in the whole movie.As for the minions, they are the classic minions. When they attack random SWAT teams - they are some ravaging, shifting and unkillable monsters, tearing people apart etc. When they fight out heroes, they become those droids from The Phantom Menace, who kind of just sit there on your shoulder until you throw them off. And they die with one bullet shot(or baseball bat whack)On top of that - many questions remain:-Who was shooting at the helicopters? -Why did Walker's helicopter escape 20 feet off the ground right into the lightshow? -Why did Walker keep these artifacts in her bedroom? So... yes, for the small screen, a TV flick with a little bit of CGI, some costumes, little character development and crazy plot - that'd be quite a nice evening watch. But theatrical release with 175$mil budget? Let me guess, Will Smith costed at least 50.Let's call Suicide Squad a ""Scary Movie"" of ""DCU"". Scary Movie 4 of DCU, to be precise.",Suicide Squad

Not his fault, they gave him a character with a daughter and thought that was enough character development. Batman was used just enough but not well. The villain was just AWFUL. Enchantress is supposed to be SCARY, weird and disgusting, she was just badly acted and a bit dirty in this, as well as over the top and useless. Why wasn't this a good film !! I mean, what the HELL where they thinking, giving a film like this to someone that had never directed a proper film in there life. I can't even remember the directors name and he hasn't been allowed to direct a film since and thank god for that. This film was fun, but it didn't have any fibre, any story or intelligence. Such a let down. I've watched this film 3 times now, just so I was definite and I disliked it even more every time, I just think they should of given all the films too Patti Jenkins, Zack snider and James Gunn.

447,jaywensley2004,"""Suicide Squad"" feels like DC trying to catch up to Marvel",7,8 August 2016,"Marvel has been developing major story lines across multiple arcs for almost 15 years: Spider Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, X Men, et al. Now they are developing a new arc on Netflix. Even ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" has the purpose of linking all the arcs. These multiple arcs have established characters and backstories to the point when they can be combined for huge stories (in comic book parlance: Cross over events).DC is late to the game and is using ""Suicide Squad"" to try and reverse engineer the concept. This movie, like ""Batman vs. Superman"" is overloaded with characters and foreshadowing of future stories until it becomes a sort of summary of what we the viewers don't but will need to know. And the truth is, summaries tend to be a bit dull.Fortunately ""Suicide Squad"" has Harley Quinn, probably DC's most unique and in her way, beloved, character. And fortunately Margot Robbie owns the hell out of the role. Harley is complicated and poses profound questions, most significantly; is she bad? Like Spike in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" she asks us to examine the importance of perspective in determining good from evil.Deadshot (to Harley): ""Stay evil..."". Is she? Does she? What is Harley's motivation for acting as she does at the movie's climax? She's lost Joker and Amanda Waller has no leverage on Harley, so why does Harley....? NO SPOILERS HERE FOLKS. MOVE ALONG.It is hopeful that after ""Suicide Squad"" DC will have established enough backstories with enough viewers (complain all you want, but ""BvS"" and ""Suicide Squad"" have and are being viewed by millions) that they can move forward with more focused stories. Both Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn have their own movies on the way and the ""Easter Eggs"" in ""BvS"" and at the end of ""Suicide Squad"" allude to future Justice League movies. This year's DC offerings have been dark, literally and tonally. But the future could be brighter and a lot more fun.",Suicide Squad
448,a_sad_cow,Well done but premature,7,10 December 2016,"As a long-time fan of DC, I thoroughly enjoyed this. However, for as well as they represented the characters, there were still many missed opportunities, most notably placing this film ahead of the necessary live-action films that should predate it, allowing the average fan to learn the characters. I held Assault On Arkham in high esteem, notably for providing closure to character arcs left hanging in the animated series. If you see this movie as a bonus to that, it's enjoyable but a bit disjointed. Deadshot: Will Smith does a really good job, but he needs at least one prequel movie to help negate his Boy Scout reputation as an actor. This follows with my theme of Suicide Squad providing closure to bad guy character arcs.Joker: Jared Leto has a solid handle on the character. Would really love seeing him written appropriately (i.e. The Dark Knight) rather than just a random plot device when the Suicide Squad needs some chaos to deal with.Harley: Well acted but overplayed. After a while it seemed like if they needed some filler, they'd just choose Margot Robbie rather than try to flesh out another character better. Good for her, but bad for the film.Plot: Overplaying the Enchantress was pretty lame. No real character development or agenda, just a contrived force for the sake of developing the Suicide Squad. We could've used the Justice League, or Lex Luthor, or a host of other interesting options, but instead we got the DC equivalent of Apocalypse from another failed movie. Bottom line: we shouldn't have seen this movie for a long time. Each of these characters should've been fleshed out in their own movie, so that seeing them come together would provide some form of closure. Instead we got a fairly random movie I keep having to explain details of to my non-hardcore DC fans.",Suicide Squad

This film used EVERY filmmaking beat-a-dead-horse cliche' in the book. The writer also used the formulaic Hollywood check list and used almost every one of them. BORING - BORING - BORING!
The ""only"" thing that kept my interest was seeing how many shots Margot Robbie was seen walking away from CAMERA in her short-shorts and trying to spot which Toronto locations I could identify in the film. She is a fine actress and obviously had fun making the film. I also like Jared but try as he might, nothing can now come close to Heath's portrayal of the Joker. He set the standard...forever.

452,taryllsbaker,One of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years.,4,6 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is directed by David Ayer and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Cara Delevingne, Viola Davis, Karen Fukuhara and Jared Leto.Following the events of Batman V Superman, a secret government agency recruits a group of extremely high-profile super-villain prisoners to execute black ops missions in exchange for clemency.First off, this was hugely superior in contrast to Batman V Superman and ultimately worked a hell of a lot better. Margot Robbie is energetic and crazy as Harley Quinn, delivering one of my favourite performances of the movie. Will Smith is awesome as Deadshot, I loved his character. We get to see a little more of his back story than others, and at times I felt I could really side with his decisions. It's great to see Smith back at his best and looking like he's having the time of his life. Hernandez, Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Courtney and Davis were all casted well and gave us realistic performances throughout. Fukuhara takes her first movie role in style with a kick-ass persona and tightly choreographed action sequences. Delevingne was fairly average as Enchantress, often being great and other times not so much. However, she is still new to the acting world, and therefore needs time to settle. Overall, she was a beautiful and interesting character. Jared Leto's take on the Joker is very different to what we've seen before, and one of the most anticipated portrayals this year. Leto settles into the role brilliantly with his bright green hair and broken teeth, giving his unique take on the famous character. Although I enjoyed his scenes, he simply didn't get enough screen time to allow me to fully judge his portrayal. I can't comment on his story or overall characteristics other than the fact that he's a hard thinker and at times unpredictable. I look forward to seeing him in a bigger role, either in Harley's solo movie, or somewhere else in the DC universe. All of these characters have great chemistry with each other and share some genuinely touching moments, most notably Deadshot and Harley Quinn.The visuals are vibrant and eye-popping, especially during the introduction to the characters within the first 20 minutes. Ayer has taken this movie in a direction I wasn't quite expecting, but it was a really cool direction. The writing felt very consistent throughout, and although some of the characters failed to grab my attention, it seemed a lot more grounded than BvS was.The story was handled almost perfectly, I loved that the characters were introduced quickly and there wasn't a reliable origin story to fall back on whenever you needed to feel for a character. There were simply a few scenes tied together that essentially did the same thing an origin would have, but in less time. The pacing is constantly fast and rarely halts for a breath, which is exactly what you need with a movie such as this. The only thing I didn't really like was the main antagonist, which I won't spoil for you, but it felt a little overkill for me. However, with characters such as these facing the threat, it didn't really take away from the entertainment. Steven Price pairs up with Ayer again with another intricate and dramatic score that feeds through the story suitably well. In between this, you have a collection of tracks that are attached to certain key moments, mostly the introductory sequence at the beginning, which feels like it was greatly inspired by Guardians of the Galaxy. There's a moment where 'Spirit in the Sky' is used and this took me out of the experience for a moment, as I'm used to hearing that in Guardians. But apart from that, the soundtrack and score are really nicely weaved into this story and it serves as one of the most memorable things about the movie.Overall, I'm very pleased with how all this turned out. I could wish for more Joker screen time, but that was never majorly promoted, so why dwell on something so little? I think everyone involved has done a wonderful job bringing the world back to life after the disappointing BvS a few months ago.My verdict; Suicide Squad is one of the most enjoyable comic book movies in recent years and David Ayer has delivered a truly unique experience for all to see. Highlighting Will Smith and Margot Robbie's performances, this is an awesome, fun and colourful look into some of the best characters in the DC universe.Suicide Squad, 8/10.",Suicide Squad
453,kevinoreilly-47281,A Super Lazy and Truly Awful Film,2,18 October 2016,"I've never seen a film so poorly directed in my life. David Ayer's vision of this chapter of the DCU was non-existent. Every opportunity he had to wow the audience was missed do to poor camera angles, with the exception of Margot Robbies ass of course. The turning point in the movie where Harley chooses sides was a spoon-fed dumbed down scene for the masses. Just awful, and quite frankly insulting that he thought we would be in suspense. As far as the soundtrack goes....did they have volunteers for the soundtrack editing? The absolutely atrocious soundtrack was made EVEN WORSE by the extremely awkward timing of when the songs came in. This was easily the laziest ""a list"" film I've ever seen. And by the way Will Smith was the worst possible choice for Deadshot, and it showed in his incredibly unconvincing performance. Will Smith didn't believe a word that his character spoke and it was painful to watch him spew his lines. Also the giant orange/silver CGI monster was conceptually the stupidest villain design that I've ever seen in my life. So glad I didn't see this in theaters, because I would have walked out. David Ayer should be ashamed of his ""film student"" like attempt at making a superhero film. But what do you expect from a director who appeals almost exclusively to morons (fast n furious), kind of like the Republican Party. Pitiful!",Suicide Squad

456,BillSims28,"Five-Word Review: Often Enjoyable, Largely Disappointing & Bland",6,12 August 2016,"Even if you're David Ayer and you wrote Training Day and directed Fury, bringing together a bunch of comic-book Batman villains that have never been in a live-action film along with a new iteration of The Joker was always going to be hard, and messy. With acclaimed actors like Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto, though, it should also be hard to mess up. I was really looking forward to Suicide Squad. Batman vs Superman: DoJ kick-started DC's cinematic universe in divisive fashion, with too many subplots and rocky direction that felt like it was too influenced by the studio. Suicide Squad, after some fantastic trailers, looked set to successfully navigate these problems. However. Its main problem, unfortunately, is feeling too much like a generic comic-book film, especially in the second half (the first half, however, is great - see below). Instead of going a unique route of having a team of morally ambiguous, blackly comic villains fight and work amongst themselves, perhaps uniting against a wild card like The Joker, we get a ham- fisted team up against some otherworldly entity (BvS anyone?) aided by faceless minions (Avengers anyone?). Comic book fatigue indeed. Another problem is the widely-advertised re-shoots that were ordered of Ayer after critical backlash in the spring targeted BvS's dull, mirthless mindlessness. Too often, the film feels choppily edited, with several portions of the film feeling like they were directed by different directors before all these sections were Frankensteined together. This seems a clear indication that there is too much 'higher up' involvement in the making of these cinematic universe films. Ayer's vision can be glimpsed through the mess, especially in the first half. His vision of The Joker as a tattooed, pimp-like, mob-boss gangster is commendable, but falls prey to reshuffling and the apparent removal of several of his scenes. Flashes of brilliance, such as viewing Batman through the eyes of Deadshot and Harley Quinn, are brilliant: the vigilante is seen as a terrifying, meddling threat who splits families apart and keeps true loves from each other. A lot, however, is lost as the film suffers from the curse of post-production reshuffles.But I digress, as Suicide Squad really isn't THAT bad. The first half especially is a joyful romp which unfortunately does not indicate the tone of the film overall. The character introductions could not have been done better, with tongue-in-cheek visual effects and on-screen writing giving a sens of the characters, and a great mix of flashback and scenes of the characters in prison providing excellent contrast. Most of the gags and humour hits (most, but definitely not all), though it would have been nice if the creators had more independence to target an older audience, perhaps focusing on why these guys are so bad. In a film that is a very, very soft 15 certificate, it is hard to display the remorseless murders and horrific crimes that they have done, and the film could have benefited from some good black comedy. The acting is a mixed bag - Robbie is simply superb, the stand-out with what is one of the only complicated roles in the film, whilst Viola Davis excels and Smith is a solid lead. Leto is alright, though nowhere near the heights reached by the likes of Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill. It often feels like he is trying too hard to be edgy and crazy, coming across as almost Jim Carrey-like at times. His screen-time is relegated to mostly token appearances, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it means more time devoted to the bland Joel Kinnaman and the eye-rollingly boring villain Enchantress, played by an over-the-top and possibly miscast Cara Delevingne (though who could sell this properly: http://tinyurl.com/zh4w52t). Basically, though, none of the characters are given enough time to bond like they say they are. Jai Courtney, doing his best Tom Hardy impression, is a promising side-character but is very underused, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc is basically useless. There are significant swathes of the film which are really enjoyable and fun, with the soundtrack simply wonderful, but there are just too many inherent problems. Uneven direction, often laughable dialogue, choppy last-minute editing, and a plot which just went in the wrong direction. It simply can't cut it at the top of the blockbuster world, and is unfortunately for me a large disappointment, especially due to all the promising signs I saw in the film.Maybe this is the comic-book film fatigue building up steam, but studios really need to change something in order to keep their cinematic universes being such reliable cash cows. Marvel's Doctor Strange looks intriguing - though if Suicide Squad proved anything, it was that trailers, however incredible they are, do not provide an indication of the film - and their Civil War was often refreshing, but there needs to be consistent adaptation. To quote Frank Underwood (fine, Winston Churchill), to improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often. If the Affleck- directed Batman film, the hopefully different Aquaman, and Justice League can learn from the mistakes of BvS and Suicide Squad, then DC will prosper. Until then, films such as this Suicide Squad are just not good enough. Mostly enjoyable, and probably worth a watch, but just not one to ever re-watch and unlikely to delight anyone over the age of 14. 55/100.",Suicide Squad
457,MVictorPjinsiste,A Bit Of A Hype,6,27 September 2017,"I just saw this movie on the recommendation of friends. I am more of a Marvel fan, but still interested in about any super-heroic stuff, that I consider in line with humanity's historic myths and legends - a fascinating study. I knew a bit about the comic book version of the Suicide Squad.It is a stylish movie, well-shot, based on an interesting premise: Villains (the government itself) using villains, to fight villains, thus exploring various shades of grey. However, the scenario is quite thin and the filmmakers have chosen to thicken it with the use of facile fan-service. Halfway through the movie, the focus gets lost. Once or twice I thought the movie was ending (it's two hours), only to find out that the real endings were worse than the imagined ones.One form of fan service that irritated me is the constant use of ""cool"", well-known rock music during the most part of the movie. Yeah I know there's the same in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Watchmen"" before that, but still, I don't like the trend. I'd rather have original music or less mainstream tracks to actually fit the spirit of the movie rather than the facile hook of a pop music video.It's clear that Amanda Waller was the comic's most interesting character, in spite of having no powers. Viola Davis, even if she is somewhat lacking in physical stature, gives the role its necessary edge, while keeping a human side, which is quite a feat. Robbie (who moves with beautiful grace) and Leto, as a more glitter-ish Joker, form a great, young-looking couple, their weird victim/abuser chemistry works, and their scenes are among the most intriguing in the movies. Will Smith for his part is at his usual, maybe restrained a bit, maybe uninterested a bit but still pleasant to have. Delavigne offers a eerie Enchanteress, quite different from the one in the comics. I like the way she acted. The Croc guy had the best line of the movie, and the fire guy had potential.On the other hand, Kinnaman was annoying as Flag. Is it the bland character or the actor, who had to fare against Will Smith I don't know, but it worked against the movie, and sometimes won. I cared little about Boomerang, and so was the movie. Katana, the flick's typical chick-with-a-sword could easily have been replaced by a dog or a robot.The worst offenders were the CGI Berry-people that were propped as the zombie-like opposition in most fights, offering ""action"" filled with rock music and total indifference. The characters go through the motions of defeating them without reason or rhyme no matter their power levels. These fights were a good time to go to the bathroom or get some popcorn, which is a shame in this type of movie. It's about time that DC steps up to Marvel in that regard.It is more a DC response to ""Guardian of the Galaxy"" than one for ""Deadpool"", IMO. All in all, a bit beneath my expectations, but still, I think this is a step in the right direction somehow, notably for the use of characters that aren't as mainstream as Superman and Batman. I would favour a sequel that learns from its mistakes, especially if it's about Harlequin and Joker.",Suicide Squad

Very little character development again. It does have its moments. It looks more like it was based on a comic than the previous two films.

I got my moneys worth but have to say that I was a shade disappointed with the final outcome after the brilliant build up. Suicide Squad is one of those rare movies to have a lot of superlative acting performances and cgi effects to match them but lacked the punch from the creative department. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, Viola Davis and Jared Leto (for the handful of scenes he had in the movie) were all amazing. The villains, Cara Delevingne and her CGI army, were disappointing to say the least. The 'Enchantress' was meant to be menacing by ended up being a comic supplement to already fun packed movie. Mindlessness is part and parcel of movies that fall under this genre but even there there was a lot of scope to keep the audience guessing. It was as if the director wanted to show too many things but was strictly forbidden by Warner bros to wrap it up at around 2 hours screen time. My opinion : One time, fun watch which could have been a lot better had they kept up the good work from the first half of the movie.",Suicide Squad

462,slicedbread117,"One Step Forward, Two Steps Back",2,11 August 2016,"Suicide Squad sets out to be different from any other ""superhero"" movie before it, with the obvious difference being that this really isn't a superhero movie at all. A team of villains brought together for exactly what their name implies, and it's a new and interesting take on comic book films, setting a brand new dynamic for story. characters and more; one step forward. However, while the premise is enticing, SS falls short in bringing these new dynamics to a high level, faltering in many aspects; two steps back.The beginnings of the film are done wonderfully, we're introduced to Amanda Waller, the creator of Task Force X (or the Suicide Squad) right away and get right into introducing the soon-to-be squad, providing great backstory to some of the characters, something the DCEU is desperate for. The mood of the film at the start is slick and bad- ass, and I quickly became anxious to see the whole team assembled. But that's basically where the film starts to fall apart, when the gang actually gets together. The pacing of the plot is set up to succeed, but then falls into a horrible pattern of repetition, loaded with some funny, but mostly unfunny one-liners and too many clichés to mention. It seemed as though director and writer David Ayer was scared to continue exploring the blank canvas he had in front of him, and opted to play it safe in the second half, going into unbearably played out ""portal over the city to rule the world"" villain plot instead of having the squad execute a more grounded task, which could have provided a much more engaging experience for what this team can do and what they stand for. Overall, the script became bland. The interaction between characters was strong and the continued backstory development was vital, but the absolute lack of continued originality (including the mid-credits scene) and terrible pacing leave Suicide Squad's story as another to be forgotten.There's plenty of action to talk about, both good and bad. There's some awesome action sequences highlighted by Will Smith's spectacularly played Deadshot, and we even get a couple cool moments from Batman himself in the form of flashbacks, especially when it involves the Joker. There's not an overuse of CGI, and each character's individual powers and traits are fun to watch. My beef with the film's action, is not that there was too much or too little, but how it was executed. Going back to my point earlier, the action was at its best at the gritty street levels, not a bunch of misfits taking down god-like beings. Marvel has a leg up on DC largely because of how closely their characters resemble their comic book roots, and are balanced accordingly during action scenes. But with DC, we have Harley Quinn and Captain Boomerang taking down an all-powerful entity like its nothing. The choreography needs lots of work, most hand-to-hand action was dull and lifeless, and the camera zoomed in heavily to try and offset the lack of said choreography. Casual fans might be thrilled with the action, but any true comic book fan should know that this isn't what SS action should look like.While the script falls short on many counts, the cast and their characters are the best part of an otherwise mediocre film. The aforementioned Will Smith is easily recognizable as the only Oscar- level actor in the cast, and his performance shows why. Margot Robbie was good, but not great as Harley Quinn. She was definitely fun, sexy and, especially in scenes involving the Joker, displayed that crazy Harley everyone knows. Then there's the unfortunate over- sexualization of her character, to almost extreme amounts. I almost couldn't enjoy the character because I had to get a booty shot every 5 minutes. Harley's backstory is fleshed out better than any other character, and for what Robbie was given, she performed well. Everyone else in the gang has promise, but the likes of Boomerang, El Diablo, Killer Croc and more just couldn't get enough screen time to develop into more fleshed out characters. They're enjoyable on their own levels, but it's hard to invest in a character when there's nothing to invest in.Then there's the big guy. The Joker finally made his big screen return following Heath Ledger's legendary performance in 2008. Now played by Jared Leto, I am very much on the fence about him. This Joker is a completely brand new take on the character and Leto's very strange portrayal is both intriguing and yet underwhelming at the same time. The character's difference was good yes, but in some ways, Joker's more thug-like treatment and subsequent deliverance from Leto made him almost less intimidating, less of what I expect from the Joker, but again, this is not your traditional Joker. Leto didn't have nearly enough screen time to make a realistic judgment, but there was some great backstory provided in the film, and although I was not overall a fan of this Joker's personality or laugh, Leto's new take and his strong connection with Harley was enough not to make me hate this iteration. Without question, DC and Warner Bros. are still a very long way away from anything Marvel. SS shows a step in the right direction for DC, in that they're willing to try something new, that character arcs need to be built upon heavily, and that every casting into the DCEU continues to flourish. But SS, much like BvS, takes two steps back with a horribly constructed script, an awful slew of clichés, zero story originality, deficient pacing, unmeaningful action and more. Suicide Squad delivers some good fun, humor characters and action, but make no mistake; expectations were not met at all in this film, and with two critical failures in a row, DC better have some moves fast that can help the DCEU climb out of its current state, a state of uncertainty.3.5/10",Suicide Squad
463,sickofenjoyingmyself,Style over substance,6,19 August 2016,"I thought the trailers for Suicide Squad looked fantastic and was really excited to see this film but unfortunately this turned out to be a bit of a let down. When I think back to what the story line actually was and how I would explain it to someone I realise that it was all a bit confusing. Not in a perplexing or challenging way, but in senseless way that lacked real credibility. It felt like there was a great idea here, and with a heavyweight cast and some excellent visuals, the real possibility for something special. But it had no substance or execution. It felt rushed. A lack of genuine depth saw the latter scenes descend into farcical action sequences. The concluding action scene itself felt like stepping into an acid trip. Another feeling of - how did this get here?? Although I have made these personal observations I still rated this as a 6 because there are positives for the film, and overall it was visually an enjoyable experience. I thought Jared Leto was exceptional in his take on the Joker. He was menacing and unpredictable and I would have liked to have seen more. Margot Robbie was seductively playful and also enjoyably unpredictable. Viola Davis also deserves a mention for her sinister turn. Some of the visuals and action sequences were fantastic to watch. Overall verdict: Despite the huge build up this film really didn't deliver. Action sequences are lazily added to cover a lack of genuine plot. Despite the great visuals and some really enjoyable performances I felt my mind often drifting and wondering about why this was all happening. Essentially the action springs out of the premise of assembling a team to deal with a catastrophe but in doing exactly that create the catastrophe. It's a bit senseless as there was nothing to react to in the first place so the entire film's action is unwarranted and unnecessary because by the end there is no apparent or credible reason or explanation for any of it.",Suicide Squad
464,verminhater,Potential for further films - could have done more with this one.,6,2 November 2016,"I found myself hovering at a middle point between the hype and the haters. Hollywood has made some serious turkeys in the guise of blockbusters recently and whilst they didn't return to a top quality one here they at least made an effort.Too much time was spent on the back-stories to the characters leaving too little time for a plot to be fully developed. The time left wasn't wholly wasted but I got the feeling that more could have been done. Should a sequel appear they will not be saddled with the back-stories any further and I'd expect a better film as a result.The mix of semi-bad guys is curious as some have either super powers or special abilities whilst others have none at all. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is a case in point. She plays the character very well indeed but other than looking good there's little for her to add to the sum of abilities. What could Harley or Captain Boomerang do that a squad of soldiers couldn't? Without a reason to use such people the entire premise of their assembly comes up short. Hollywood please take note and adjust the members accordingly in any sequel. I'm not averse to ladies in small pants but give them a reason to be there besides the pants. The whole idea of the suicide squad is to do things that the soldiers can't, so provide characters that meet such criteria. It should be easy to add and remove such characters as befits the job at hand and who is in the prison.The main villain played by Cara Delevingne came across well and I thought she did a fair job of it. She was no doubt helped by all the cgi and audio effects going on around her. To sum up the plot, she plays an ancient evil entity that the squad must battle to save the world.It's Viola Davis though who steals the scenes as the assembler and manager of the squad who comes across as an ""anything to get the job done"" character very well.Next time keep the back-stories to a minimum and find characters that add to the sum of the squad.",Suicide Squad

466,captainmike-michael,Amusing but Thin in Character Developments,7,6 September 2016,"The arrival of these bad-asses have boosted a transformation effort of DC universe in term of a bit lighter tone at the very beginning but the entire film still leaves an impression of being darker compared to other Marvels production, which is a bit let down from what it is marketed. Trying to expand just like Guardians of the Galaxy, uneven plot and character development are the main issues of Ayer's screenplay. The movie sets up after the death of Superman and rushes towards the event hosted by the main antagonist, affecting the overall fluidity of the story. Assuming that audiences are already familiar with the comics, all the characters are briefly introduced and it works less effectively especially when the Squad itself is not well known like Batman or Superman. Will Smith and Margot Robbie perform decently as Deadshot and Quinn, emotional engagement does exist among all but lack in depth for featuring too many characters at one shot especially Joker. Despite these main problems, action sequences are packed enough and fun to follow while the visual effects are more colorful compared to the other DC films; Retaining the rhythm of Zimmer's BvS theme, Steven Price has composed the scores in a different tunes, combining some rock musics that suit well the film and a sense of DC universe's continuity. While it misfires at plot and those super villains are not shown to be doing anything too evil, it does not aim to be like other superheroes films, it is still amusing and it gives a new life to DC's big-screen universe.",Suicide Squad

Missed opportunities.This movie should never have been made for PG-13, but R rating. But because it has been made for kids, this movie, and all that it could have achieved, is a huge wasted opportunity of gigantic proportions. Marvel was also hesitant to make Deadpool with R-rating, but they finally did, and it payed off.I hate all the mistakes DC are making these days. I grew up with batman and superman comics in the 80's and 90's, so it hurts when i see them treat their own material this way.Margot Robbie is the star of this film, she steals all the attention in every scene she is in, and i can not but imagine what she could have done with this character if it was not a movie for kids. A huge contrast to the rest of the cast assemble which has too little to do, and they are to many, so we don't ever get to like or dislike any of them. To top it off, the joker has far to few scenes in this film, which is a shame. Jared Leto plays a solid mad joker.And as i predicted before the movie came out, was that David Ayer would yet again fail. He and Fuqua both, are riding on the success they had with ""Training Day"", and IMO none of them have directed a good movie since then. Ayer is not a good story teller, he is good at blending action with CGI, which this movie could of had a lot less and rather spend time on the story. His direction, combined with a weak story, and combined with PG-13, disaster happens.And this is a movie that was so hyped as well. This was the one film DC had to do right, to prove they had it in them. The Marvel movie that kind of compare to this is ""Guardians of the galaxy"". And what Marvel did right was to give all the characters a unique and special personality, making it easier to recognize and care for them, which then made it a good movie. Here in ""Suicide squad"" we just have an outstanding Margot Robbie with a bunch of ""others"". Which is a damn shame.I heard before i saw the film that a lot of the Jokers scenes were cut out of the film before the final cut, i haven't read more into it. But The Joker had way to few scenes in this film, maybe the other scenes they had to remove weren't PG-13 friendly.*sigh* Why DC?. WHY?Is it so damn hard to make a R rated movie now and then? With an R rating, this movie would have dared to be as violent as it has to be with this assemble of anti heroes. The Joker can go full ballistic, Harley Quinn can be even more daring, The language even more naughty and provoking. It is all the movie needed to be decent or even good.

It was average. But there were some flaws, major ones too. One of the characters I hate would be Slipknot, while they introduce us to the characters they never mentioned about him once and he was just there for a few minutes and then they killed him. So why do they need to introduce him? Why do they if he's not going to have any importance to the plot. They never mentioned him again and they don't seem to care about it. Next time if you're going to introduce the character that will have no impact towards the plot just don't do it. Second of all I hate how The Joker is so minimal within the movie when he did nothing that was important. But he's better than Jesse Eisenberg as a comedic version of Lex Luthor. But he was hyped up throughout the trailer acting like he's part of the team as well. But no DC decided to cut all his scenes out. Is he going to be part of a standalone Batman movie? I don't know, but most likely he is, but next time don't hype him up if he's going to have any bare part in it at all! But also a person suing WB because of it for some reason.Also why does a government official think it would be great to have a league of villains to stop the 'next' Batman? Even the characters question it. Why couldn't it be better to hype up the Justice League movie by having the JL characters band together and work as a team? Call it, 'The Dawn of Justice' I think it works that way better rather then this considering it feels like filler ready for the Justice League movie. The government official didn't even have a reason why to do this sort of thing anyway. We didn't see her wanting power, wanting to be better than the rest or anything all we see her is that woman who band these villains together.To be honest the actress of Quinn was pretty good though more average in my opinion. She definitely plays a crazy Quinn but some her lines that she delivered were sort of meh but the scene when she defeated the villain was good reverse psychology as we see her reverting a bit back to her old self like psychologist. I also like Will Smith's role too. The character he played, Deadshot. I like how he cares for his daughter despite what he does as a job. It definitely shows he has a heart and a human when it comes to the people he loves. Plus some of his lines that he delivered were good too as they have that Will Smith charm to it as well, especially, 'Lady, you are evil!' The same applies to El Diablo he felt bad for what he had done to his family and become a pacifist and rather not to kill anybody else. I think those three characters deserve there own movie and they should've been built up for this one like Marvel did for the Avengers. It would've been better if we get to know the characters and see them battling together. Plus it feels like Deadpool with the dark humour but trying to be serious as well.The other characters were bland or not really funny. I don't think Captain Boomerang was funny. His humour feels very childish and annoying and he hardly had any development nor backstory and pretty much most of the other characters in the squad didn't really have enough focus or time. Since there are deleted scenes it's not really surprising considering that DC and Warner Bros. had ripped some of the fans off with the theatrical version of Batman V Superman.The villain, Enchantress in my opinion was pretty meh. She was not really threatening, her motivation was cliché and the whole flash thing that she did was not really anything and the CG, I think, for her was really bad. Her head stayed still but her body was shaking for some reason. In the end it was average but I don't think it's worth it for a moviegoer and since it's most likely this'll be down voted by DC Fanboys, bear in mind critics are people too and they too a movie fans as well. They have their own opinions like many things because like art, music etc. films are subjective, period and there's no such thing as a right or wrong opinion.",Suicide Squad
473,Chiller7,Fun factor trumps its few flaws,10,7 August 2016,"This is a fun-filled, action-packed movie with all sorts of eccentric weirdo characters and story elements and outrageously exaggerated over-the-top performances. My theater audience was laughing the whole time. I was laughing. We had a great time. We loved it and so will you, unless you're a curmudgeon.Plot/storytelling: On a surface-level, this may seem like a typical simplistic super-hero movie story - big threat arises, our ""heroes"" must work together to stop it. But to look at it that way may be missing the point. This is a movie where what's technically the main plot of the movie is less important than the individual stories of the characters themselves, and their backstories, motivations, interactions, etc. It felt like at least as much, if not more, of the movie was devoted to their backstories as on what they're currently doing in the movie, which felt almost less important. It's an interesting approach to storytelling. I liked it.Action: Pretty good overall, except for some flaws. This is not Zack Snyder-style meticulously choreographed smooth artistic action, but instead, a lot more chaotic, standard Hollywood-style action quick- cuts, especially towards the end, when it may have gotten a bit all over the place. Here's where I'd normally knock a star or two from my rating, if the overall fun didn't boost my rating back up. In general, the action/fights in Suicide Squad don't reach the superb quality we saw in Man of Steel & Batman v Superman, but at least this movie doesn't do the annoying shaky-cam thing, a la Batman Begins, Captain America: Civil War, the Bourne movies, etc. where you can barely see anything in the a lot of fights. The best action moments go to Harley Quinn, easily.Characters/Actors: Deadshot: Best Will Smith role I've seen in a long time. You will feel for him and his sad story. You will laugh at his sarcastic remarks. You may wonder why a guy with guns would be on a super-powered team, until you see what he's capable of, and then you will be in awe. Harley Quinn: This may be the most perfect comicbook to film casting choice ever. Margot Robbie embodies this character completely and she steals the show. I've been a fan of this character since Batman the Animated Series of the 90s and Margot nails this role.Joker: This one's interesting and may divide opinions. Here's something I noticed: this is the first on-screen Joker to not have an upward-rising red smile actually painted onto his face. For the first time, he's actually able to frown and give other intense expressions. He's totally creepy the way he instantaneously switches back and forth between intense and grinning expressions. I'll say, I loved this Joker, even if there were many Joker moments seen in the trailer that seem to have been cut from the movie. I wanted to see more Joker in this movie.Enchantress: One of the weird unexpected characters you'd only get from an unusual movie like this. She's like she came straight from a horror movie. The most visually impressive effects in this movie are for the Enchantress's magic.Amanda Waller: I've seen some complaints about the villain of this movie should have been better. I don't know what they're talking about, because Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was intense and intimidating. She will scare you. Other characters: Everyone does such a good job, even if they don't all get nearly enough screen-time.Other thoughts: An unusual number of scenes from the trailers didn't make it into the final film. I can only wonder why, because the ones that I noticed were missing seemed like fun and interesting moments. Without knowing what was originally in those scenes that were cut though, we can't really judge whether cutting them worked out well or not.I like what these DC movies have been doing and I like where they're headed. They're not afraid of pulling inspiration straight from the comics giving us something different than what we usually see on screen, instead of following the tired old movie formulas. Keep it up, DC. I look forward to Wonder Woman (2017).",Suicide Squad
474,oazam,David Ayer's Writing and Direction- a complete letdown. The Suicide Squad themselves will keep you engaged throughout.,6,31 August 2016,"I have been a DC Fan for quite some time after Batman Begins. I was eagerly waiting for this movie after Batman V Superman because it's a continuation story.David Ayer's writing for the movie was inadequately bleak. The story line of the movie was so bland that it was appealing during 1st half but during 2nd half, no sign of any storytelling. The execution of this DC motion picture is far out the most atrocious things I've ever seen. The editing wasn't crisp at all and the transitions were majorly sloppy and out of shape. Ayer should've taken a lot of time doing workshops on Superhero Movies because his previous films were all war and action based so he should've taken interest in following up the textures of a DC Movie. Zack Snyder is also in the same category so Ayer is not alone.The girl who played Katana was horrifyingly cringe-worthy. Her role just didn't make sense to what was integral to the script. It was like Ryan Reynolds in green Lantern- trying too hard to get into the character of a superhero or super villain.The positives in the film are the only the roles. Margot Robbie has finally gotten a good package for this film. After watching the Wolf of Wall Street, she was terrible in her role but for this one, she just finessed although she did drag on a bit during the climax. Jared Leto as Joker was simply great. The comedic humorousness that he had in this role was simply a joy to go through in this film. Will Smith as Dead Shot was adequate and good. He managed to mesmerize everything in the movie perfectly especially his gunshots in the movie.Overall, this movie wasted the potential and could've been one of the finest films yet but landed being a outdated directed superhero letdown fest, which is why Suicide Squad is a One-Time Watch or worth- watching on Netflix or a TV Broadcast",Suicide Squad
475,shinedowness,Pretentious Portrayals of The Original Characters from the Comic Books,1,29 September 2018,"Only Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger can pull off The Joker facade, but not Jared Leto. Not now currently. What makes me hopeful is that I have looked harder and found better films that are recent in comparison to this film that is easily downloadable from its notorious popularity from being part of the now desperate Warner Bros. company.",Suicide Squad
476,manigarg0000,Bad is good and good is bad.,7,21 January 2021,"I haven't watched many DC characters so I had no expectations from most of them but I liked them. Having such powerful characters they could have made it into a masterpiece. There was no justice to the characters except Harley Quinn and Deadshot, others were not given so much explore. So overall it is a nice movie but does not fulfill expectations.",Suicide Squad
477,conannz,Soundtrack was the best thing about this,3,3 September 2016,This very much seemed like a whole movie worth of background filler setting up the back story for a real movie sometime later on. Like an endless trailer. The very best thing about it was the soundtrack. Just imagine the sound of music on fast forward with better music but only props instead of actors and that would describe most of it.There is a bizarre subplot involving the Joker which should have been left out as it just made the movie longer and it is already the longest trailer in history.The character of Amanda Waller is so bad she makes the other characters look positively heroic. And yes I was surprised when she popped up at the end of the film showing us that the whole thing was just a trailer for another film.The only reason I am giving this a 3 instead of a 2 is the soundtrack and Will Smith. That man can make pure corn dialogue sound meaningful and he is the only actor who surpassed the limitations of the writing. For an example of this genre that raises the bar go see Deadpool. Somehow that film transforms its comic book universe into something that is entertaining. Suicide Squad does not.,Suicide Squad
478,Authoric,Had the potential to be good,6,16 July 2021,"Sadly, this movie ended up bad.

This had the potential to be a good film but was ruined by Enchantress.",Suicide Squad
479,reisen55,Guilty Pleasures,7,7 September 2016,"Now about a month down the road from watching, it strikes me that SQ is a far better variation on the standard CGI-based superhero film that Marvel and DC have come to own. When I watched CaptAmer-CivWar (to use shorthand) it was going to be another gigantic CGI fight after another and when Ironman-Cap go at it, well neither is going to be killed. More of the same. So the concept of taking the bad people and putting them to work is a very good idea. It is impossible to improve on Heath's wonderful JOKER of course, and Leto needs more time to put humor into his character. But the plot and action stayed to a local scene (not worldwide massive huge destruction as in X-Men Apoc) so that was more believable too. I do fear though that the CGI-Superhero vein has been mined to pieces by now. Nothing new most of the time. Which is why this particular film is good because it is DIFFERENT.Remember the magic of SUPERMAN in 1978? Batman in 1989? We are far gone from those two films now. Enjoy them too when the world was primitive and effects were real and we had a really good Lex Luthor and Joker.",Suicide Squad
480,nate-car,"..looks and sounds good, with great characters... but story and plot need A LOT of work!",3,16 August 2016,"When I think of 'super hero movies' I often hear them- the 'Crow', 'Spawn' and 'Watchmen' movies all having such amazing sound tracks that a blind person could enjoy them equally. This is one of those awesome 'audio' movies with both modern and retro blaring beats.It also has a fun color palette and visuals to match. All in all... it looks and sounds good, with great characters... but story and plot need A LOT of work! Instead of building a universe like 'Marvel', 'DC' has just thrown piles of money, characters and CGI at the wall like it did with 'Dawn of Justice' and fortunately for their pocketbooks and the zeitgeist most of it works.Will Smith is NOT terrible, and it turns out he DOES 'play well' with others, which doesn't explain why he hasn't been in an ensemble since 'Independence Day' 20 years ago? Margo Robbie is ALL and everything that you have seen and heard. She portrays fan favorite 'Harley Quinn' perfectly for the characters first live performance and she looks AMAZING every second of the film.Cara Delevingne's 'Enchantress' is the only thing that could tear your eyes from Robbie. Her character has about four incarnations, each almost unrecognizable from the last and is completely fantastic and horrifying at most times.'Joker' is excellent and should have been an integral part of the story instead of a reoccurring gimmick and back story. Jarod Leto is King in this role, playing a very slick and sexy version of the character. I am busting to see his chemistry with Ben Affleck's gritty 'Batman'.The rest of the gang are pretty cool and fun, but at NO point in the movie does this team come across as 'the bad guys'. They're abused at points by their jailers and constantly threatened with death if they are disobedient, which paints them more like victims, and their actions out of prison are almost solely heroic.The plot unfortunately is filled with holes and incredulity. It was more like a 'Justice League' threat, than a job for these convicted criminals. I feel it should have been less epic, and more of a ""send a fox to catch a fox..."" type story. There was so much unnecessary CGI, explosions, SFX and superfluous characters like the army guys running around all the time. There are three helicopter crashes that everyone survives in the middle of the city. The final enemy/threat/fight is sort of stupid, considering they are almost all 'B-list Batman villains' and the enemy are basically two omnipotent gods.Lots to love in this movie, but once again, seems like it should have been a 'second or third phase' movie, rather than the third installment of the 'DC Universe' building attempt.",Suicide Squad

484,Scarefish,The worst Oscar-winning film of all time,1,28 May 2018,"On my first viewing, I thought this film was okay, and on second viewing I proceeded to slap the stupid out of myself until my head nearly fell off, and it's such a dull mess that I don't even know where to begin, but I will attempt to do so nonetheless.Here's the good, and it's going to be very short. Harley Quinn was excellent in this film and she gets a lot of screen time, and she feels like the only character even attempting to make this a fun experience. Margot Robbie's performance is probably the only reason I was fine with the film in the first place, but it's not a good excuse.Every other character is dark and gritty, wallowing in their self-pity, and they're all a bit despicable. Deadshot is probably the second best, being mediocre and not so offensive as the others, however the film focuses on him as the main character essentially though he was not interesting enough to carry the film. He's an impossibly skilled assassin who's also a father going through a divorce while his ex-wife is an irresponsible mother, which is essentially the same thing we see in every Oscar-baiting drama ever made. Killer Croc is probably the worst simply since he gets no development or depth at any point which is a missed opportunity at morbid cannibalistic humor. Diablo is probably the only character with development, however it happens much too late in the film and the reveal comes off as contrived, and leaves him being the least active character up until the end of the film. Boomerang is simply as bland as his name sounds. Katana shows up later than the rest of the squad, and her gimmick is a sword that traps souls and has her husband's soul trapped inside, and there's no payoff to this revelation and she hardly has any screen time. There's another guy called Slipknot, the man who can climb anything, and he is the only character not to get an introduction, so it's painfully obvious that he's entirely expendable.The introduction of the film is a complete mess right out of the gate. There are literally two introductions for the main cast done back to back with popular music tossed in, making it come off as a cheap fan-made music video. There are several origin stories blasting through at the speed of light here, combining the superhero film fatigue, origin story fatigue, and whiplash of terrible pacing all together into a projectile vomit-inducing concoction.The basic plot is horribly cliche and contrived. First of all, the main conflict in the story is caused by Waller in her creation of the Suicide Squad, which isn't a concept that made any sense in the first place. Why would she think it to be a good idea to put together a team of rowdy baddies to ""fight the next Superman"" in case he were to be bad?Seriously, I understand they wanted a fun movie with bad guys being forced to fight together for good and subvert our expectations of villains, but none of that is executed effectively. Enchantress also has the MacGuffin, yada yada, giant light in the sky, and she's overpowered, leading to a dull final confrontation at the end. The monsters throughout the movie were also incredibly dull, as they were just guys in suits with weird black orbs all over their bodies, undoubtedly for the PG-13 rating.This really should have been a hard R, especially considering it came after Deadpool. It feels like a dull DP ripoff that's constantly pulling its punches since it's more concerned with marketability rather than entertainment. There's also edgy content with the Joker and Harley that feels forced. The scene in the strip club served no purpose beyond tossing in more sex appeal and killing off another character from the comics within a minute of first being shown on the big screen.The editing is incredibly jarring. The relationship between Joker and Harley was clearly edited to make the relationship seem more mutual, and thus it truly ruins the Joker's character beyond making him into a thug. There is a moment when Joker pushes Harley out of a helicopter, but it's cut in a way to reframe it to be like he was saving her and sacrificing himself instead of a morbid prank where he was trying to push her to cause harm.This Joker is clearly the worst Joker to date, which is hilarious considering how much insanity there was with Jared Leto around this film. After all his insane real life harassment and supposed method acting, all there is to show for it is what feels like five minutes of total screen time and only one line that can even be considered a joke. He acted as nothing more than a plot device for a couple of scenes with Harley Quinn that weren't the least bit important to the story ultimately, thus he was useless to the film and would have almost been better cut out entirely. Jared Leto's an overhyped person in general who claims to be an actor and a musician despite producing no quality performances for either line of work.It's hilarious that people defend this film so strongly as it's the sloppiest pile of garbage DC has offered us so far, and the one good aspect of it is simply not enough to make up for the countless flaws throughout by a long shot.",Suicide Squad
485,phoenixyk1,DC seems to be getting it right... slowly...,7,7 December 2016,"I finally got around to watching the movie after missing out at the cinema. Kind of glad as it was the extended cut.I also watched after YouTube Veteran I Hate Everything released his own scathing review of the movie...So the key is what do I think?Well, in all honesty - IHE - Or Alex as he is better known - had many valid points about the film... For me the film is a mix of the Good, The bad and the downright Ugly.The Joker: The GoodJared Leto - I have to admit, I was concerned about Leto as The Joker - Following up the late Heath Ledger was going to be an uphill struggle.Thankfully, he actually pulled it off... More of a reckless gangster than Ledger's darker portrayal, Leto does come across the right side of Crazy and sells the New Joker very well indeed...The Bad:Simple - LACK OF SCREEN TIME!!! Maybe DC and WB have plans for a solo Joker Movie but if that's the case, Suicide Squad FAILS TO SELL THAT VISION!The Ugly: Flamboyant though the Joker is in the DC Canon, Many have taken exception to the Makeup and tattoos of Leto... I am somewhere in between, they do suit his portrayal but I can also see why fans are up in arms.Harly Quinn, Margot Robbie is FANTASTIC and gets the best amount of screen time to sell her character in my view. Sadly, and it is rumoured to have been a major point of contention for Robbie on set, she is WAY TOO OVERSEXUALISED!This does detract a lot from what should be a very personality driven character.The Effects are FANTASTIC! The sets look great and a perfect balance of CGI Vs Practical for many set pieces works well... With that said, there is a LOT of CGI. Which actually leads into IHE's Biggest gripe and one I concur with.In a Universe that has Batman and The Flash, Both making Cameos... They rely on the Suicide Squad to take out this evil... WHAT THE F**K!?Seriously, While the Enchantress looks amazing, and the first transition is LEGENDARY - I can see why Alex calls this the best scene in the movie, it truly is epic in its simplicity - the overall idea and what they are fighting... NO! JUST NO! THIS IS NOT A JOB FOR THE SUICIDE SQUAD!!!While we are on Enchanteress, Carla Delevigne is one of those Models that everyone raves about, but to be honest I have never really paid any attention to... As the Archaeologist, she plays her role very well indeed and seems to be a very competent actress......But when she becomes Enchantress which is 90% of the movie, She is not acting!!! She is just being a damn supermodel!!!Now some may rave about this, but I am sorry - it really spoils the immersion. She literally is just modelling!!! BORING! A real shame as I think she actually has real potential.Will Smith - What more can you say - He is Will Smith!!!Overall, Each Character is great and played well... Its also where the film suffers its greatest issues.It has action a plenty, some lovely slower moments to develop SOME of the characters - El Diablo's story is great... But there is too much to build on...While in the comics each character has had time to shine and build up a history, there is no room for that here!Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang is actually great fun - But you never really get to know him... This is a character that needs a place in a stand alone movie to build his history. Likewise, Killer Croc, El Diablo has a story that would be great for the Big Screen...For DC's Cinematic Universe, Suicide Squad is a step in the right direction - Overall I found the movie very entertaining, but it lacks in other areas.The problem is that the movie has been made far too early - All the characters could have done with a role as a villain or their own stand alone to really shine!Its has plenty of action, some real heart wrenching moments and some laughs - Nothing laugh out loud funny but some... And it is enjoyable!But DC is never going to compete with Marvel as long as they keep trying to cram so much in! DC, Warner Bros... SLOW IT DOWN!!! You saw what happened to Spider- Man when they tried to shove in way too many story arcs and characters... You are doing the same thing!!! BUILD UP!!! That's what is needed!!!So overall, I have marked it quite low for those technical reasons - There is so much potential in this movie that was wasted by trying to go full force too soon.A real shame as actually it not a bad film at all... But its way too cluttered and most of the characters you just won't give a toss about unless you are an avid comics fan.",Suicide Squad

Its not even like my expectations were so high, because of the bad publicity it got, i lowered my expectations, and still came out disappointed.Some very interesting, weird and wacky characters we have here, but they did not really play them out.Robbie should have been an excellent Harley, but she wasn't. Leto you would have thought well capable of playing the joker, and though he was not bad, he was not great(though it might be because of the obvious comparison with Heath Ledger, impossible act to follow).Hollow, full of holes story, no character depth.DC just too much in a rush.",Suicide Squad
487,bodhi-13262,"Don't forget, we're the bad guys.",5,7 August 2016,"'Suicide Squad' was undoubtedly this summer's most anticipated movie since it's announcement a couple years back. Does it live up to the hype and break the critical curse of DC? For something to start with such promise, it sinks faster than the Titanic:(1. From the moment the film begins, we get a rather cohesive introduction to all the villains imprisoned at 'Belle Reve'. I was impressed to see how well things were balanced as we get flashbacks and brief back-stories of all these characters. It's obvious at this point that Batman (Ben Affleck) appears in the film, and it's also no surprise that he's the reason why most of the inmates at 'Belle Reve' are locked up. We especially see how Batman captures Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) in flashback sequences. There is also a pretty cool cameo by 'The Flash' (Ezra Miller) in the segment where Cpt. Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is captured by him. All in all, the film has a strong opening that really pulls you in.2. The initial plot follows the events of 'Dawn of Justice' in the wake of Superman's death, which prompts ruthless government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to assemble a response team called 'Task-Force X', in the event that other threatening super-beings were to invade earth. Coincidentally, a new threat emerges in the form of a possessed bitch called 'Enchantress' (Cara Delevigne). At this point the foundation slowly starts to crumble, beside the fact that the character of June Moone/Enchantress is so f#%king unlikable and that there is a sickening love-story between her and Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnamen). I also hate Cara Delevigne as an actress, and she really adds to my belief here from all the popping' n lockin' bullsh#t choreography the Enchantress has. 3. We never really get a proper understanding of how or what Enchantress is using or doing to destroy the world apart from the fact that she creates a green halo in the sky. If you think what I said sounds clichéd, the bitch also unleashes her brother 'Incubus' (who is just a tall and terrible CGI creature) and transforms the remaining people of Mid-Way city into black, face-less (literally) and non-threatening mutants, who's only purpose is to serve as a reason for there to be a couple action sequences in which the squad haplessly takes them out. The threat in this film just proves that the story was terrible on the part of writer/director David Ayer. It's sad, cause you'd obviously expect more from the guy who wrote 'Training Day, Harsh Times & Fury'.4. Viola Davis seems more like the real threat in this film, because she plays Amanda Waller as ruthless and cunning as she should be. Will Smith as Deadshot connects you more than any other character in this film. Smith has a natural charm that he brings to every role, and it's hard to not feel for him when you see his story and the struggle he has to be with his daughter. Joel Kinnamen (Rick Flagg) had a good structure at first, but he proves to not be much of a badass as we think, and we soon realize he's literally just chasing the p#ssy. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) had some promise latter in the film until he (for no apparent reason) bursts into a flaming CGI monster at the climax and leaves you utterly confused.5. For the one person that hardcore fans have been waiting to see since Heath Ledger's portrayal, might have to wait a little longer to be honest. The Joker (Jared Leto) unfortunately has less than 15mins of screen-time in a movie that's 123mins long. He appears in a few flashbacks as well as being intertwined in the initial plot, but we still never get a proper grasp or feel of what his character is all about. Jared Leto is undoubtedly an amazing actor, but he is completely sidelined in an already clustered film. Harley Quinn falls down the middle for me cause she was never really a character I cared for even in the cartoons and comics. However, the relationship between her and the Joker was by far the most interesting aspect of this film btw.Talk about falling short of the glory, a saying which perfectly summarizes this film. I can honestly say that 'Dawn of Justice' and 'Man of Steel' were by far better films than this (no matter by how little). Zack Snyder can no longer be solely to blame for lack- luster DC films, but here's to hoping Patty Jenkins, James Wan and Ben Affleck can save this cinematic universe.",Suicide Squad
488,SteveResin,Flawed But Not Without Merit,7,4 December 2016,"After reading so many disappointing reviews since its release I watched Suicide Squad with some trepidation, but it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I expected. It's above average, but there's no denying it's flawed and parts of it just don't work at all.Similar to Sin City it's very meta in its approach. It plays up the comic book aesthetic and for me this worked well. It's quite dark with splashes of bright colour that reinforces the Sin City vibe and it looks great.OK, the good - The cast are mostly excellent, particularly Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman and Jay Hernandez. There's a few neat appearances from Affleck as Batman and a short cameo from The Flash which was fun. Will Smith is decent as Deadshot, but his casting took me out of the movie constantly. I always felt I wasn't watching Deadshot, just Will Smith. I found it hard to separate the actor from the character, maybe they should have gone for a less iconic actor in the role. His acting is flawless though. Margot Robbie is flawless too, but I must say the constant gratuitous shots of her backside were over the top. The character was completely sexualized and if they'd reigned this in a little (or a lot if I'm honest) her character could have really been something amazing. It's a little tough to admire her acting chops or the dialogue she's been given when her backside gets top billing. Horny young teens will love it though...Sadly there's a lot of bad. The choice of music is either hugely predictable and tired (Spirit In The Sky anyone?) or just awful. The storyline is wafer thin and the big bad, an ancient and powerful witch called Enchantress has zero backstory which removes any sense of urgency to the threat everyone's up against. Her relationship with Kinnaman is also underdeveloped so why should I care, frankly? The Deadshot and his daughter scenes are largely awful and feel out of place, some of the dialogue is poor and the climactic big fight scene fell short.The most polarizing part of the movie is Jared Leto as The Joker. I've always admired Leto as an actor, he's done some incredible work in the past and had a thankless task following in Heath Ledger's much loved footsteps, but I have to be honest and say it didn't really work for me. He's more like some meth-crazed gangster than The Joker, again his back story with Harley was too short and underdeveloped and his dialogue is largely appalling. I thought Harley had more chemistry with Diablo, which says it all.I rated it a 7. If you can ignore the flaws there's an enjoyable film to be found here, not a classic by any means but certainly has it's moments.",Suicide Squad
489,jpachar82,DC Mayhem,10,15 August 2016,"Confusion. Chaos. Mayhem. Destruction. Words that describe the worst sort of criminals. Criminals of mastermind. Criminals who love to make chaos go boom. These criminals have one thing on their mind – destroy. The criminality of destruction is only but of the mind, but it has its consequences. For the suicide squad, led by the government operative Amanda Waller (played beautifully by the wonderful talented Viola Davis) she leads an all-star cast of villains to help save the city that is under siege by an evil force from another time and another place. From Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Agbaje) – this team of criminals along with the King of laughter, the Clown Prince (played by the beautiful talented Jared Leto) The Joker – this team is out not for revenge, but for redemption at a second chance with society. This movie wrecked havoc by the critics, won DC fans over with just the message of teamwork and unity. Suicide Squad will go down in DC Comics as the talked about movie of Summer 2016",Suicide Squad
490,CinePendejo,"A bad movie, but a guilty pleasure?",2,9 August 2016,"Here is how I encapsulate Suicide Squad in one scene in a movie. Not in any of the plot elements, the way the dialogue exchange, or the abundant gun-toting action scenes, but in the end credits. Yes, the end credits – where, after the world is saved by our ""heroes"", we see them back to square one in their cells in the prison in the typical ""gritty reboot"" Warner Bros aesthetic. Then, out of nowhere, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, who is by far the best part of the movie) escapes from prison via a jarring raid led by her methhead puppy-face Leto Joker. Then after that, the credits roll in a bombastic, colorful blend of purple and green vape gas while a rap song called ""Sucker For Pain"" plays with Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, and Ty Dolla $ign. It's not a particularly good song and the credits look phony and obnoxious, but it looks cool and based on my short range of crowd that I sort of hang around with. That's the whole summary of Suicide Squad in my viewpoint. Suicide Squad is - both objectively and inescapably - garbage. Scriptwise, the story makes no sense, plot points get repeated for no reason, backstories serve no purpose other than to rush character development, and most of the characters don't serve anything to the plot at all. Aesthetically, the direction defines choppy, the world in which the cast share isn't cohesive – one character looks straight out of a Grudge movie while another one looks like those S&M clowns that might fit in Spring Breakers – the tone has ""schizophrenic"" written all over its face, (no thanks to those reshoots, because that always works!) and the CGI looks distractingly bad. Taken as a whole, it's the cinematic equivalent of the modern, lazy, pandering rap song made cynically by the intent of establishing a name rather than making good products. BUTeven considering how much I actually listen to those same bad rap songs, I still like it? Yes, the movie sucks and has no right to be overrated by those against the ""biased Rotten Tomatoes"" , but I still find joy and guilty pleasure in this cluster of a movie.The story, for the record, is far too convoluted to summarize. After the events of Batman V Superman, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) for some reason comes to the conclusion that the world needs the help of Gotham's rowdiest criminals. So she recruits Killer Croc, Boomerang, Harley Quinn, El Diablo, Deadshot, and some other guy, under the help of Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg and Katana to do some rescue mission. Oh, and Davis comes to terms with Enchantress – who looks like she was pulled straight out of a Troma-esque Grudge ripoff – in order to persuade the officials to use the Squad, only to eventually be held hostage for the film to set up a rather questionable twist. Oh, and Enchantress is controlling Flagg's boring girlfriend as she controls the city via a sky wormhole and a strangely crappy-looking demon brother who serves nothing other than a mini-boss. Oh, and the Joker shows up for no reason for both a flashback and in act 2 and literally drives and/or flies by the screen without any point.So yeah, like Batman V Superman, the movie suffers greatly by numerous plot issues and bad design choices. This time, instead of the Goyer- Snyder ""golden boys"" screwing everything up, we have one man at the helm taking all the blame. Now I may like David Ayer's movies in his unapologetic, openly grimy movie catalogue, (I personally think Fury is still his masterpiece) but there is no denying the amount of weight he struggles to carry here, doubly so thanks to the reshoots. Constant shifts in tone, weak transition of plot elements, and a stupid-looking choices he makes with the purple and green color palette and supercharged cutting techniques make the film look occasionally phony, and that's before you see the final boss in her crappy-looking silk-sheets-as-smoke-clouds getup. In design, it's as if Ayer desperately panders to the new age of wannabe gangster Snapchat teens the way he panders to thugs in Harsh Times, as he also shoves on- the-nose pop songs in any scene possible. However, as someone who objectively follows some people in that demographic, I can't help but enjoy this broken apparatus. Even among the catchy soundtrack and weirdly enjoyable aesthetic, there is quite a lot of genuine good that's sadly squashed by the vape-stinking baggage. The backstory for both El Diablo and Deadshot are genuinely engaging however short-shifted, there's a small bar scene where they share fun banter, and I'd be lying if there aren't some good payoffs in the action scenes. Plus, I cannot deny the effort by Margot Robbie as the best Harley Quinn ever (although a bit oversexualized) , Will Smith and Viola Davis. All the rest are on autopilot, but its fun to see Jai Courtney hamming up as an Australian stereotype.Sadly, all the poor actors lose any goodwill by a terrible performance by one Jared Leto as the new Joker. Passing aside the way the film contrives his every screen presence, Leto simply fails at invoking any menace or charisma to this character. Initially, I like the idea of making the Joker of more like a modern street thug, but Leto tries too hard to make another Heath Ledger impression. The result is embarrassing and almost sleazy. If this shows up in the new Batman movie, then DC/Warner Bros is even more screwed than they already are.However, with that all in mind, this movie is the ultimate guilty pleasure. Nothing is good about it AT ALL, but I can't shake off the mindless, pandering, coked-up fun that is Suicide Squad. Take that for what its worth.For more reviews, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/08/review-suicide-squad.html",Suicide Squad
491,Thekeybaldemasterrises,Why do people keep on insisting this movie is bad?,3,8 August 2016,"I loved it! I don't understand all this complaining from the bad reviews. I was so ashamed going into this opening night with fear of it just being absolute garbage, but I had a blast watching this movie. Now don't get me wrong, there are definitely issues I get what people are saying. The editing seems choppy at times and it's evident a lot was left out, in particular scenes with Jared Leto's Joker. I just read in an interview with him that they cut so much out you could've made a whole movie alone about him. I'm saving the judgement on Joker until we see more of him in another movie, you should too! The other thing I disliked was it all seemed too fast once the action started rolling, there was never really a time to breathe at least until the bar scene which was one of the most excellent scenes in the entire film. People have a problem with how the music fits into the movie and that it acts like a cheap knock off of the formula used in Guardians of the Galaxy. I loved the music, I thought the random songs were a good fit for the chaotic tone of the story, these are damaged people being thrown into a chaotic war zone, and I personally feel that music choice fit the maddening pace of the movie. The clear standouts from the cast are Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn who just totally remind me of the animated series I would always watch as a kid. Anyone saying Robbie is not a good fit for Harley Quinn should ask Paul Dini who I think has a more credible opinion considering he helped create the character. Everyone else was in it very little but I still enjoyed their performances as well. Rick Flagg was fine for the leader position and he didn't bother me as much as he did in the Robocop remake. Viola Davis played a good Amanda Waller but I wonder if they maybe took the character a little too far. She's a nasty lady in DC history and Davis played her well but maybe a little too well, one scene in particular made me question if it was out of character for the decision she made. I thought Kitanna was really interesting but I definitely wanna see more of her in a sequel because she wasn't in here very much either. I hate Jai Courtney and I don't understand why he's still working in Hollywood but shockingly, he blew me away in this movie as Captain Boomerang, funny and just a really fun character he completely surprised me. Jay Hernadez brings some heart to the role of El Diablo and I really enjoyed his character in the second half. David Ayer has some background in past movies bringing some relatable traits to a character we would classify as a gangbanger, and Hernandez does such a good job bringing a tragic back story we can feel emotion for. If you're a fan of Slipknot you'll sadly not get much out of him as he's just a plot device in the movie. Killer Croc was fine for a supporting role but I still think King Shark would've been more intimidating to use. Enchantress was awesome, I hope this isn't the last we see of her, Cara is just stunning and the character felt like a big threat the team really had to overcome. The team together was almost perfect to me, I really saw the humanity in these characters who are just bitter and angry with the world that outcasted them, and yet by the end they all had the courage to help Rick Flagg save the world. I can't believe I'm saying this but these bad guys acted more heroic than Batman and Superman have in the last two movies! I felt for Deadshot and they pulled off his personal life very well. I could hear someone in my theater yelling at the screen in a particular scene when he's being prevented from accomplishing the mission because of a personal memory of his. I laughed at the jokes and I just had a giant smile on my face in a lot of scenes and at some of the great cameos that I believe were handled soooooo much better than the ones in Dawn of Justice. It seems like there's a lesson to be learned here at WB and DC to not interfere with the director's vision and let them make the film their way(and I'm looking at you Wonder Woman). However I realized if this is the rushed version the studio cooked up out of paranoia, then David Ayer's cut has gotta be really good because this was still good. This version that's supposedly not as good as Ayer's was still better than Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I'm telling you guys this was the best thing they've put out in this universe so far, and I think the only reason critics are giving it a hard time is because the movie relies on fans having knowledge of some of these characters. So what if Killer Croc didn't have depth to him he served as a supporting character, and he was fine. The movie was suppose to be a simple DC passion project and because of the failures of Batman v Superman people expected this to be the better movie, it could never have lived up to the hype people created and I'm deeply saddened by all the hate it's received. I'm being honest here, I want more DCEU movies like this, not like Batman v Superman. It's not as bad as you've heard, but for some it may not be as good as you hoped. I for one though will be seeing it again and hope Ayer can give us another cut when the Blu Ray comes out.",Suicide Squad
492,JabezGill,6 stars... for Harley Quinn.,6,13 May 2020,Margot Robbie was the only good thing about this Movie. Great portrayal of her character. Everything else was embarrassing and mediocre,Suicide Squad
493,Timbo_Watching,"What a miss, what a miss..",3,18 April 2020,"Sigh... where to begin with this film...So, the characters.. DC was trying to jump the Avengers bandwagon and failed. Whereas Marvel made multiple films building character and progression, DC threw a bunch of new antiheroes together and called it the Suicide Squad. The only character I liked was Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn, the rest was really bland/boring and had little to no value. I also really dislike Jared Leto's Joker, it was a disaster to say the least... And even Will Smith had such a bad role, which I don't blame him for but I blame the terrible writing of this. Because oh man, the plot was... non-existent. What plot even? Some random antiheroes fighting some shady looking monsters, freeing a woman from a so-called ""powerful"" monster and then they live happily ever after... not. They just go straight back to where they came from; their cells. Oh and don't even get me started about the very random songs they threw in for no reason. It made me even more disconnected with the film. I don't even want to know how much they've paid for these missmatches of songs throughout the film.This film literally was useless. No character development, no real story, random music, and really boring and difficult to sit through in general. Avoid this film at all costs.",Suicide Squad
494,twbond-00867,A bold decision for DC. It certainly delivered.,10,7 February 2021,"David Ayer's Suicide Squad (2016) is a very enjoyable, very well effected movie. It's something DC has never done before until now, and every member of the ""Skwad"" are a treat. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel Kinnaman, and others in the squad, well-received.In my personal opinion, more Joker please! Jared Leto needed more screen time, however, it should've been called 'Suicide Squad & the Joker' if Joker had a bigger role. The mission to save the world handled by the supervillains is absurdly great, something different and not very original really makes it work. And, not to mention, Killer Croc, was really handled well, rocking the hood just makes it just different and really interesting.The villain, could've slightly pulled it off better, but having the romantic between a hero and a villain is really cool, most couples in superhero movies are both the hero, but not in this film. Having Deadshot try to live up to the father he is supposed to be is executed well and it doesn't go over the top whilst trying to focus on the film's plot. The final battle is well-received and is enjoyable. Deadshot dreaming about killing Batman is excellent, just something new a hero's point of view. The film is about the villains, not the heroes. And that is so enjoyably great.Overall, the film is flawless and a great take for DC. Looking forward to The Suicide Squad in 2021.10/10.",Suicide Squad

Suicide Squad became a hit on very different on many levels as we see bad guys becoming heroes fighting an evil entity in this dark action comedy movie. The performances of Will Smith, Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and the other actors were sublime except for Cara Delevingne who is a terrible actress and should stick to modeling. I liked the Batman cameo and the reference to Superman's death from the last movie. DC movies never disappoint and they're way superior to Marvel.",Suicide Squad
501,KikyNez,I actually almost loved it. I am in the squad :3 Joke's on me,9,9 August 2016,"BEWARE! I will write a huge spoiler below all...I have seen a lot of reviews for this movie and a lot are destroying it. I actually almost loved it...It has flaws, of course. But sure is better than Superman: Man of Steel (not kidding I hated that movie), and let me tell you that better than Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice (but this one I liked it, and loved Affleck as Batman, and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman).There is not much time and poor development of the characters except for the main, that are obviously Deadshot and Harley.I am so in love with Harley since her first apparition on the animated series, I just felt so happy for a character like her. Don't misunderstand me, I loved her because she is so damaged that is brilliant. And must say that Margot Robbie was awesome in character, so much her... so much in love of Mr. J.Cara Delevigne surprised me, not a fan of her and I thought she wouldn't convince me but she did. Anyways, Enchantress was not that awesome as I expected, but was OK, and Cara did her best on it.I almost didn't recognize Jai Courtney! He was not the cute baby face dude I am used to see in him. Damn good and really misused. It could have been more, really.And ""Diablo"" character was underdeveloped, his backstory was kind of hurtful, at least for him (and me). Other thing underused that could bring more. He was the hurted soul that took the lives of those whom where his life, just for being pride of his power... He is not anymoreAnd Katana, the actress Karen Fukuhara is fantastic and fit the role perfectly, is a shame that poor she have in the movie. That was a backstory to develop, and a sadness that could give a great story.The biggest flaw was the use of Joker. Jared Leto was amazing! So disturbing and clownish. I don't know, I just loved him as Mr. J! but it was so little we have from him, and not initially intended to. I mean, I was expecting the mastermind that I love in that damaged and creepy character, some ""manipulating things behind scenes"" you know? I needed more of Joker, and with more ""coherence"" if my words are understood.But for all, the scene in the bar was my favorite in the trailer, it is a shame that was cut in the theatrical release.The action was pretty good, the story have his stupid things (lik, how the hell Wellar thought she could control Enchantress? even I saw that coming... that's was really stupid), and some clichés, but overall was great and from now on one of my Not heroes favorite movie (being Deadpool my true love).I would love a Uncut, or Director's Cut, or Extended version of this movie, with more scenes and a little backstory for the entire group and not only Harley and Deadshot. I absolutely need a sequel!And so sorry Slipknot died so early! That wasn't fair! I was so surprised, not good to mess with Flagg (no Stephen King pun intended)The Worst: Not enough backstory for the other in the group, a story line for fighting the enemy a little slow. The Best: action was great, SFX were awesome, Harley was amazing, and Joker was stealing camera when he appeared, and Deadshot was pretty cool.9/10 for me.Watch at your own risk, if you do: Welcome to the Squad",Suicide Squad
502,anandrajeev979,A Funny Summer Movie that critics got wrong,8,10 October 2016,"Basically this a a ride of fun,action and laughter of 2 hours.Its everything a good comic book movie should be. I rated it 8 and it could easily have been 10 if there were few more scenes for the characters especially joker , croc , and katana. Still it is a good movie worth your time and money. Will smith is great in action. Joker is good too but i wish there was more of him, still he manages to left an impression. Croc is actually not much used here. Katana also got some nice action scenes but rather than that she does little. Flag is what he is .Enchantress was the one I watched the movie for however sh did little disappointed me in the after she rooted for her brother as I think that was not required. Now the best part of the movie is HARLEY QUINN. Every single scene with her , every single action scene, every single word she spoke she is my god so funny and great and her devotion to clown prince makes this all more interesting. I mean who would hit The Enchantress with a HAMMER ??? Thats Harley Quinn. I really wanna see more of her in future.My last word is Forget Marvel Universe.Both are good and both have same superheroes.But DC has more powerful and amazing characters but hasn't any good luck in spreading it through movies like Marvel has did with so many phases.So its no war between dc and marvel but this movie is GREAT and critics treated it wrong.I think that petition to turn down Rotten tomatoes was right.I mean this is not worth 37%.

503,jpkwolf,A mediocre antihero movie with a great cast.,6,13 August 2016,"The best part of the movie is the cast. Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and she steals the show. Will Smith as Deadshot gets close. Their characters get more screen time than the others. They havebetter and longer backstories, so there's more depth to the characters.Only character I didn't enjoy was Jared ""douchebag"" Letos Joker who just doesn't impress. He purrs and growls in a weird way and is not particularly menacing or intimidating. He is decent but c'mon, Joker is supposed to be so much more. Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson did it so much better.The storyline feels disjointed at parts and gives the movie a rushed feel. Biggest problem of the movie however are the antagonists that are quite boring and the third act that becomes a generic battle without any suspense. Overall Suicide Squad is not terrible, just quite mediocre. The cast is great but ultimately that is not enough as this movie should be amazing. At least the story doesn't jump around all over the place or drag along too much like Batman v Superman and it's a slightly better film than that good looking mess of a movie.",Suicide Squad

Nothing is really logical in this movie and even the character played by Will Smith is not entirely bad. The special affects are very nice but once again the story is stupid and so are the characters.

Margot Robbie was great as was Will Smith who both tried to get something out of this odd movie and dumb script. The editing is so choppy and erratic that it's hard to watch at times. It's funnier than previous DC films which is a welcome change, but humor isn't going to save this so called ""cinematic universe"".

510,yoyopa,Why and How is Will Smith the star of this movie?!?!,1,8 August 2016,"Where to start...woe is me...where to start?!?! First I'll say I was looking forward to this movie for a long time..like many people. All I really cared about was of course...the resurrection of The Joker!I think Jared Leto has the kind of God given talent that can never be taught to any actor. He was born with it, like Nicholson and Ledger before him. So needless to say I was absolutely stoked to see what he would do with such an iconic character. I didn't really care much about anything else. Which leads me to say WOW! The marketing on this film was the definition of false advertisement. There were so many interesting story lines to play with here. The Joker and Harley Quinn with their demented love story wouldve been my first choice. It was Jared Leto and Margot Robbie that shouldve been leading this movie...NOT WILL SMITH! guys I can't stress enough how much i dislike Will Smith. Guys this whole movie revolves around Will Smith playing Will Smith in a movie where he's supposed to be playing Deadshot.God I can't stress enough just how much he ruined this movie for me. Basically he did his whole schtick from Hancock but threw on an extra layer of ""stereotypical hood black guy"" and called it Deadshot. As an African American..I cringed every time he opened his mouth.Sorry about my Will Smith melt down...he is just really awful.I really would've liked to understand more about Enchantress..there was definitely not enough time to establish her at all. The ""Villains"" were literally moving props whose only purpose was to slow our heroes down.Also, I'm not sure Cara Delevigne has the gravitas to really dig into Enchantress...but I could be wrong...The fail on June Moone could very well all be on David Ayer's shoulders. Also the CGI for Enchantress and her movements in the final sequence were actually laughable. I couldn't take her seriously.Diablo was the only actual Metahuman and they didn't explain his origin whatsoever. Not in a meaningful way anyway. Captain Boomerang wasn't terrible..not memorable either. Killer croc was there...could barely understand anything he said...but he was there...and apparently loves BET(GTFOH). Viola Davis was solidly cold hearted as Amanda Waller. Davis, Leto and Robbie were the only strong points of the film and there was not nearly enough of them.Personally, I really enjoyed Batman V Superman. I know the plot was a bit of jumbled mess and the bat vs supes was like 5 mins long and then there was Doomsday..ugh. But I still really liked it. There was a lot of it that dealt to me very believable circumstances. I can't say the same for SS...I never bought it. Not once did I sink into the story of the characters...I was always very aware I was in a movie theater watching the fresh prince flap his lips.To the folks at Warner Bros..ya'll need to step your game up..and do it quickly. You cannot keep making sub par movies like this. I'm this upset and I didn't even have to pay to see this movie. I can't even imagine the folks that are shelling out hard earned money for the 2 hour crapfest I just sat through. Jeez man...What a waste of Jared Leto. Save your money guys and pirate this crapfest in a week.",Suicide Squad
511,iamianiman,Senseless fun & entertainment with all of its rebellious action sequences.,4,5 August 2016,"Seeing the whimsical world and the flamboyant images mixed with the actual dour tone and the sense of fear coming right through you, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. But there's one person who mesmerized me and told me to stay put, it's no other than Joker only goddess lover, Harley Quinn who was played by the famous Margot Robbie. I love her all the way, even my first thought to play Harley would be Emma Roberts, due to her bitchiness in every movie she's acted in. Margot enlightened the mood by giving every shot, the most prominent acting over all the celebrities they had in play. The childish side of Harley was apparently there too, which the only thing I hesitant about when they certainly picked Margot. No need to say more, again she did it! Nevertheless, between all the scenes she had on screen, which was almost in every part of the movie, the most perfect moment in my opinion was when Amanda emphatically asked Deadshot to shoot her after Joker has taken her alive while tangling around the rope joyfully saying goodbye, Deadshot intentionally missed the shot and Harley was playing dead. After a few secs, she swirled around and gestured, 'Ta-da!'. Oh my, I want to marry her now. No kidding, please!Joker was the latter choice who stole the show last night. Unlike Heath Ledger's Joker who was extremely creepy and quiet, this new Joker was boisterous and fresh, giving audiences extra flavor to it. The best part about Jared Leto's performance as the new Joker would be the mischievous giggling. I don't know how he fortified his technique, but he managed to enhance the scariness in his mere giggling despite his 20 minutes screen time (He got cut, plenty of scenes, maybe to attract people to buy the extended edition in six months from now?).Will Smith was good as Deadshot, it's just that the way he talked reminded me of his past movies. I love Jai Courtney as Boomerang! Many have I talked to claim that he didn't deserve any recognition in the latest Terminator, but I guess he has proved it wrong this time. His character as jinx and bogan attitudes who liked to drink lots and lots of booze suit his acting well. The new girl who held the role as Katana should give a standing ovation. If not mistaken, this was her first acting in Hollywood. Joel Kinnaman played Rick Flag as the daddy of them all, he's like the more aggressive robocop this time, and the only person that he really had a faith of trust was Katana. Killer Croc was scary, El Diablo stole the show when his hands were on fire but was bland, a man with chained-pyro abilities but afraid to use his power seemed kinda irritating at times. Enchantress, the ancient witch with a malicious spirit would scare some pants off and Amanda Waller occasionally forgot to take her meds (Watch the movie). Slipknot was the least good, he could only play with ropes and I didn't even know why he was there in the first place! Batman was on screen for 4 and a half mins total whereas Flash was in a hurry, 5 seconds estimation. The talented Scoot Eastwood was apparently just a soldier. The computer-generated imagery was stunningly designed, just like the purple Lamborghini (C'mon Pudding, do it!). While all of this worked, they deliberately put an unforgivable plot. Most of the critics said was right, it's just too weak and unpolished. It put too many clichéd sci-fi in there, as a cinephile, I felt totally disappointed with it. No wonder most of the critics gave this movie rotten tomatoes. The action scenes began 10 minutes after they trekked into the city. I thought they saved it for the cool fight scenes, but I guess that also was intolerable as I was hoping more of 'em. But when there's Harley, there's action. The stunt was great, it's just that the pacing that wasn't. It's here and there, sometimes shaky even when it's supposed to be statically rigid. The non-stop soundtrack kinda stored most of the time, but a few of them were misplaced. The mid-credits gave a cliff hanger to the upcoming Justice League, a somber Bruce Wayne having an official chat with Amanda Waller.The ubiquitous posters seem to give attention to people, don't forget the trailers too. But the plot immensely failed to give people justice. The demanded DC/WB companies, 'We're a big family, PG-13's would be the best for every movie in DC Universe.' was just unbearable, leading to many people aggravated and infuriated including me as it should have been rated-R (18 and above). In that way, David Ayer (director) would just do some of his clever stunts, due to his other movies that were rated-R. It would promise gory, bloody violence, grisly images, pervasive language and strong crude content as well as disturbing behavior.The production of the film seems rushed with the questionable editing. As a whole, 7 minutes was cut proving from the initial 2 hours 10 minutes told by many reliable sources (IMdB, Wikipedia) but then was permanently said to be 2 hours 3 minutes. Even a few parts in the trailers failed to give extra trivial to the story such as the teaser trailer, when Harley Quinn offered the sentence, 'I hope we got insurance!' or when she's pointing horizontally her 'Good Night' tattooed baseball bat and mouthed her voice with the sound of a loading (Schuck-Schuck) shotgun or the play in the first official trailer when they were in the deserted bar and Harley said, 'I love this guy!'. There were so much of Harley and Joker's cut that shouldn't be done as it'd ruin the movie with the already weak plot.",Suicide Squad

513,olivewahh,Such a good film,9,14 February 2020,"Now I don't know a lot about the DC universe or the comics, but from what I watched this movie was dope.A group of villains are banded together to help take down an evil force taking over the city. That's basically it..I thought this was so cool, and enjoyed it a lot. There was rarely any slow parts and it was full of action and exciting scenes. Margot Robbie was so incredible and fun to watch. Proud to see an Aussie go far.",Suicide Squad
514,ericnottelling,don't waste your money,5,8 August 2016,"This movie is painful to watch. DC comics has no idea what it is doing. This was their answer to deadpool and it simply sucks. Harley Quinn is the only character in here that is even remotely entertaining. Jared Leto is the worst joker I have ever seen. He is terrible. His lines are terrible, his acting is terrible, it's an embarrassment to even associate the joker with him. Will Smith flops in another movie. His ego has seriously blown his head up way to big. He simply puts no effort into roles now. He just mails it in. I was expecting a whole lot more from this movie. It's the most pathetic group of ""bad guys"" I have ever seen. This whole movie should have been shelved day one. The script was awful, most of the casting was awful, most of the acting was awful, and the directing was horrible. DC is just having a very hard time in putting anything together. First Batman vs Superman was an epic failure now this. They both suffer from the same problems too. How can you not learn from your mistakes. I would suggest everyone else does and not waste their money on this movie",Suicide Squad
515,bartonj2410,Will DC ever learn?!,4,6 August 2016,"The DCEU (Detective Comics Extended Universe) hasn't really got off to the greatest of starts with Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. I liked the former but the latter was disappointingly poor, with critics not really taking to either well at all. Now we have Suicide Squad, a film that many felt could potentially put DC back on track with their cinematic universe.With director David Ayer pulling the strings and the likes of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and Viola Davis starring, Suicide Squad was easily one of my most anticipated films of 2016.After the death of Superman, intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is convinced that she has the solution, should something of Superman's power want to threaten the world. Her plan is to assemble a team of the most dangerous criminals to take on any threat too great for regular soldiers.Task Force X or Suicide Squad, as they name themselves, is made up of; Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Slipknot (Adam Beach), each and every one of them under the command of Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) who, like Waller, sees them all as expendable.When an unworldly threat arrives, the squad try their best to get the job done however, their villainous nature and the Joker (Jared Leto), looking to get Harley Quinn back, might just throw a few spanners in the works.Just like the film that proceeded it in the DCEU, Suicide Squad is a mess of the film that literally allows the audience no time to breathe, shoving the characters down their throats and forcing them to fall in love with them right away. David Ayer's narrative is so rushed, getting to the finale within around forty-five minutes, meaning there's no real time for any sort of character development. His film also has quite possibly one of the worst villains in the history of comic-book adaptations, and that's not even an exaggeration.The film is also edited really badly, chopping and changing so much that you'll start to get a headache, and not just in the action sequences. Ayer's script is really disappointing, considering the fact this was rated 15 in the UK, yet nothing here made me feel that was warranted. There's also the fact that every moment that should have got a major laugh was ruined by the fact they were all seen in the trailer. If you've seen all the trailers you've literally seen the whole film.The thing that annoyed me the most about Suicide Squad though was the soundtrack, which I was really looking forward to see how Ayer would incorporate it into his film. Now, Marvel didn't event the usage of a cool soundtrack to accompany a film but, in Guardians of the Galaxy, the musical choices made perfect sense with what was going on in the relevant scene. In Suicide Squad, random songs play at random times and it just ruined some scenes in particular.Coming to the performances, which are easily the best thing about the film, Suicide Squad has some form of redemption. Viola Davis is great as the intense Amanda Waller, as is Will Smith as Deadshot. Harley Quinn was always going to be a tough character to bring to life but I felt Margot Robbie did her enough justice, whether it's enough to warrant a solo film is questionable mind. I actually really enjoyed Jai Courtney's performance as Captain Boomerang which is quite something considering I normally can't stand the guy.Cara Delevingne, who hasn't had too much acting experience, can be used as a bit of a scapegoat as her performance isn't great however, I feel that was more down to how awfully written her character was. Joel Kinnaman doesn't really do anything wrong as Rick Flag, it's just unfortunate that he had to step into a role that we could have potentially seen Tom Hardy in if he didn't have to do reshoots on The Revenant.The use of the Joker is something that has been bugging me ever since I left the cinema. Jared Leto had huge boots to fill after the perfect performance Heath Ledger gave as the iconic villain in The Dark Knight and I think Leto did well. My main issue was that he just wasn't in it enough for my liking. The Joker has to either be the main villain or not in the film at all, not a side character who pops up for a couple of scenes throughout the film. I was intrigued by what we did see of Leto and it would be great to see him go up again Ben Affleck's Batman in a future film. You can't even consider judging him as the best representation of the Joker until we see more of him.There are some Justice League cameos in Suicide Squad, one lasting a split second and the other featuring Batman. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the appearances Batman makes did feel really jarring and out of place. I loved him in Batman v Superman but not quite so much here in Suicide Squad.While Suicide Squad does offer some form of entertainment, like other films in the DCEU, it does so with glaring issues you'd think they'd learn from. It's not the end of the world mind, remember the MCU had two not so well received films that followed Iron Man and look what they've gone on to achieve. It just means a lot rides on Wonder Woman so no pressure DC.",Suicide Squad
516,tolunayd22,A fun adventure!,5,19 May 2019,"It finally came that day. I watched it as soon as the movie went online. I didn't really expect it before I saw it, because it's been 2 months since I've been out and I've been trying not to buy too much spoilers. I want to tell you about this team. The American government wants to gather a team against any threat. These are the worst and most psychotic people in the world. And what happens happens after the incident in Midway City, the government begins to gather this team. Now, if you understand this part, let's come to my own views. I see I like this movie. Whether it was acting, soundtrack, Batman and Flash, they were all good details.I don't think this movie has ever been the enemy. OK Enchantress is a powerful evil, but this enemy has no depth in the story. Who's Enchantress? or his brother? who are they? They're coming out of one. Enchantress awakens his brother and ransoms the world. They have all the bad ends to conquer the world. For example: General Zod had a depth and character instinct. But here, we put a couple of enemies, bird on top of the air to make a origin. As most people say, if the enemy is not well-rendered in a movie, that movie is bad. Yes, that's the right view we've seen everywhere. For example: Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Ultron was a terrible villain. I mean, the movie didn't need an enemy anyway. For example: if the movie is a cake, add the enemy to this movie remains in the sauce. The second problem, I see the characters in the world or something always"" very bad "" was touted as. When I saw the movie, I said how these guys are enemies. You're bad, okay, maybe if you're bad viewers will hate you, but a little bit of people do not leave the perception of ""villan"" these characters. I say this as someone who has played the Arkham series, these characters are not like this. In the movie, Harley Quinn, Deathshot, El Diablo, always tried to add a human being. Okay, do you think these guys are Batman's enemies? I'm not sure about that. By the way, the Deadshot Batman is like this, Batman makes him Robin :)The second shortcoming of the movie is that these characters are ""bad"" parts of the movie can not be transferred well. The third problem is, I'm saying it clearly and clearly. I don't like Will Smith being a Deadshot. Why? This guy already has a lot of drama movies, and when I look at this guy, I don't see him bad. How's that Deadshot? He's one of Batman's enemies in the game, but he's the angel you know here. I just felt sorry for him when he was fighting Batman, that's all! The event in one mask. It bothered me that Deadshot wore that famous mask very little. Why did you choose Will Smith? If I say he's not wearing a mask, it's a place. So he can see his face and make a profit. Well, never with me don't be angry. If they've never brought Will Smith money into this movie, then drown me here! so, I'm sure.I like Margot Robbie. I had prejudices at first, but he played really well. As for Joker, what is this guy doing in this movie? Okay, he wants to find Harley, but I'm confused by an Enchantress Joker. And they put him in the second role. The Joker and Harley relationship is not so deep and magnificent. I didn't see any depth in the relationship between them. I'm glad the film was about the universe. I'm really happy to see things like that in DC. The movie was carried by Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The soundtrack was very good. I mean, I was good at visual merits, but I don't know why the budget didn't say so much. But after all these words, I realized that there was really some improvement in DC movies. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) you need to compare it with, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) is better, but in caring for the characters in this movie I would say that is a very entertaining movie. I didn't notice the cut scenes as they were in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. I mean, the movie's gone. I'm looking forward to DC's upcoming films. In the meantime, I'm glad that the Extended Cut version came to Blu-ray. I recommend you to watch the movie, but know that there are mistakes in cookies and logic. enjoy the movie...⭐ 100/64",Suicide Squad
517,pkneer,I Was Worried About This Film - And I Was Right,2,4 August 2016,"First, I had never heard of the Suicide Squad before this film was announced, but that's not necessarily bad as I had not heard of Guardians of the Galaxy either, and that film was outstanding.I had a bad feeling about this film, so much hype normally means the studio is trying too hard to publicize it to make up for a bad film. But a buddy talked me into going, so I did. I was very disappointed to say the least.Without giving away any spoilers on plot, the characters just do not gel - no charisma between them at all. Margot was the best of the group, but even her character became irritating after a while. I found it hard to root for any of the characters in this film, good guy or bad, as it would not have mattered if every character lived or died. Each character would have a moment that was interesting, then poof, it was gone. Even Leto's performance was a ""Wow"", then ""Meh"", then confusing. What a mishmash - no flow or continuity at all.Then there is the special effects. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 90s the CGI was that bad. For an action movie with characters like this, the film gets an overwhelming failing grade on effects.For a popcorn movie, it is not completely horrible - but as a comic book movie in today's world, it was just awful - much worse than Batman v Superman.Rating is a 2/10. For this type of movie, you must have either top notch special effects or a first rate script and this film had neither. The only reason it gets a 2 is that some of the action sequences were decent, but certainly not enough to carry this film.",Suicide Squad
518,terrellrobinson71,This squad brings the heat and they're the bad guys,8,7 August 2016,"Back in March, there have been a lot of shock and awe from people that ""Batman V Superman"" was a bit of a disappointment. I didn't think so, but I was hoping that the DC Extended Universe was starting to get better because we have ""Justice League"" and ""Wonder Woman"" coming out next year. But right now, we'll make do with ""Suicide Squad"". This movie has also been on the negative end for critics, but I found it to be a stylish and thrilling comic adventure with some nice standout performances courtesy of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman. Now I'm not gonna reveal some of the secrets of this movie, but I'm willing to give you a heads up. Following the events of ""BvS"", Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) decides to come up with an idea to hire the worst of the worst villains in order to take down more evil bad guys. We actually get to meet them. First, there's Deadshot (Will Smith), a contract killer with a heart of gold. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), a man with a dark past and a power to shoot fire out of his hands. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), who lives in the sewer of the prison and most definitely look like a crocodile. Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), a goofy Australian schemer who uses his boomerangs. And, of course, my favorite, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), who has been under the spell of her favorite boy toy, the dangerous Joker (an underused but winning Jared Leto) and is not afraid to vex and irritate people. Along for the ride is soldier Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) and his bodyguard Katana (tough Karen Fukuhara) as they try to take down pure evil. I liked the energy, the dark humor, and the vivid colors of this wild and crazy film written and directed by David Ayer (writer of ""Training Day"", also written and directed ""End of Watch"" and ""Fury""). But sometimes you get kind of confused as to where the story takes us and we don't get to know at least some of the characters including Slipknot (Adam Beach) and the Enchantress a.k.a. Dr. June Moone (Cara Delevingne). But in its own sloppy, choppy and messy way, I found it terrifically entertaining and funny as hell. Also if you loved or hated ""BvS"", you'll probably have the same reaction for this movie. Me, I liked it better than ""BvS"" and I also expect to see more of these DC characters and this extended universe. Plus, there are a lot of good surprises in there.",Suicide Squad
519,Chris_Mac_25,Like an average TV episode,2,25 May 2019,"Pretty poor, Margot Robbie is in good form here but that's about it. Will Smith tries to make his character appear deeper than just the standard bad guy but instead just makes him seem mentally challenged. The others are underused as the studio clearly decided to focus on Smith, Robbie and Jarred Leto, doing his best to create his own version of the joker. Unfortunately this iteration of the Joker falls completely flat, lacks any sense of menace and thankfully disappears prior to the end of the movie.",Suicide Squad
520,talarisw,"Not nearly as bad as the critics said it was, better the BVS. A good movie but lacks some edge",8,8 October 2016,"Let me start off by saying that this was my most anticipated movie of 2016. Ever since November of 2014 when they announced that they were making a suicide squad movie I was stoked and checked the web for every detail. I love the comics and I couldn't wait to see the joker and Harley Quinn together in a live action movie. The trailers were great! and after I and many others were disappointed by BVS the pressure was on this film to save the DCU. So did it live up to the hype? Was my year and a half wait worth it? Well for me I would have to say yes and no. I thought it was a really good movie but not as good as it could've been. Well let me say that the thing I liked most about the movie was the characters. I thought the film had great characters that were generally interesting and each actor fit their role perfectly. This is what makes the movie good, which are the great characters. Every character worked for me there was not a dull character here. Every character made me want to see more of them. The stand outs however were Deadshot, Amanda Waller and Harley Quinn. Will Smith surpassed my expectation as he turns out one of his best performance in years as Deadshot. It was basically Will Smith playing himself but he was great. I love the flashback with Deadshot and his daughter and then batman shows up. Ayers did a great job with the deadshot/daughter subplot without making it feel cheesy. Viola Davis was perfect as Amanda Waller. I wish she was bigger because I like the heavy set Amanda Waller but other then that Davis was great! She was like a female Dick Cheney. I loved how dead she looked behind the eyes. I can't wait to see more of her in future movies. Margot Robbie was perfect as Harley Quinn. I thought her voice was great, which is the most important thing about Harley. I think she had more of a Long Island accent instead of Brooklyn like in the original cartoon. Her outfit was great! It was like biker chick meet roller derby. I love her baseball bat and I especially love her pants with her butt cheeks hanging out. The scene where she walks out the elevator and you can see her butt is priceless. Also I loved seeing her in her iconic court jester outfit. However there's not enough time to develop her as much as she needs it. But like I said every character worked, Diablo was great. Captain Boomerang provided a lot of comic relief and this is the first role Jay Courtney is really great in. Killer Croc was great but he looked to skinny when he took off his shirt, he looked better with the hoodie on. Katana was great and I would like to see more of her. I thought Enchantress made for a good villain, I thought she had an interesting backstory and I like the creepy horror movie like effects on her. Also Cara Delevine gave a solid performance as well. Joel Kinneman was also great as Rick Flagg, I think he brings a lot of personality to what could of been a 1 dimensional character. Now last but not least the joker. I don't think it's as easy as just saying he was good or bad, so I'll put it like this. Every scene I saw him in was great. Leto's joker looks like a fascinating character but the truth is he wasn't really given enough screen time or character development. Like for example the film never explains why he has the tattoos or what they mean to him. However like I said I do like what I saw from him. I really like the whole pimp thing he got going. Unlike Heath Ledger's joker he cares a lot about his appearance and image. He's well dress, drives a nice car and has a good looking woman. I like that he seems to be a criminal business man that owns a strip club, which he has Harley dancing on stage. I also love his henchmen who wear bizarre outfits like one guy dressed in a panda suit and another guy dressed in goat mask. However one of my problems with the movie is that it's poorly edited and the greatest victim of this is Jared Leto. I feel bad for him because these idiots cut out most of his scenes. Scenes that were in the trailers are not in the movie like when he says ""I can't wait to show you my toys."" I love that. I think the worst of it is Harley Quinn's flashbacks to Arkarham and I really wanted to see the scene where joker has Harley strapped down to a table and say ""I'm just gonna hurt ya, really, really bad"" and then proceeds to give her electric shock therapy. I think if they would have shown more of this it could've done a lot to develop the joker as a more three dimensional character. However I do like his obsession with Harley Quinn and I like how insane he looked when he was shooting out the helicopter. However my biggest problem with the movie is despite how much I like the characters I think they're simply not bad enough. They're suppose to be ""worst of the worst"" and ""the worst heroes ever"" but nobody within the squad dose anything really bad. I think WB wuss ed out on doing something edgy but instead played it too safe. Simply the movie is not as crazy or as wild as it could've been and that's a little bit of a let down. Although I think there's a lot of potential for these characters. I would like to see a Joker & Harley spin-off. I also like the music and visuals by Ayers. Overall a good movie but not great.",Suicide Squad
521,trooper5783,Worth seeing more than once!,10,24 August 2016,"After seeing the trailer before Deadpool back in February, I had high hopes for Suicide Squad, since DC films have needed their dose of energy and variety lately, with no humor and not a lot of compelling storytelling. The actual movie itself, however, did that and more- while watching this movie, I tried to find any flaws, but I didn't find anything that I disliked. Everything hits the right notes- the amazingly vintage song choices the trailers promised, the increased number of jokes, the cameos, the character development, the action sequences, the performances- the list goes on and on. One thing that needs to be addressed- Suicide Squad is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, I laughed out loud more times in a theater than any movie I've seen this year- even the audience was cracking up, too! The action sequences are infinitely fantastic- I watched this movie both in standard 2D and 3D with IMAX, and the movie looks great in either format that can be chosen. I loved this movie so much, I'm already seeing it a third time with one of my best friends, and I barely see a movie more than once in the theater! Don't listen to all the haters on the Internet- it's what you want to watch, not what others instruct you to watch.",Suicide Squad

You need at least 3 hours to build characters and another hour to get into the action. Just rushed like most of these films. Use the AVENGERS model.

524,morkulv_athferion,What is wrong with the critics??,8,6 August 2016,"This is probably one of the few times where I'm just baffled at the reaction of the critics. Apparently Suicide Squad is getting mostly negative reviews, and having seen the movie in theater today, I still have no idea why many people seemingly dislike it.Right off the bat, this movie thankfully ditches that horrible overused ""dark and grim"" atmosphere that has plagued action and superhero movies ever since the first Dark Knight movie was released. Don't get me wrong; the Nolan Batman movies are great, and I love them in their own way, but they helped popularize this ""dark and grim"" tone that honestly I'm completely sick of seeing. This tone was also one of the factors that ruined Man of Steel for me, especially because it felt so out of place there. With Batman, you could argue that his character suits the dark atmosphere. With Superman however, the character is about hope and belonging and the tone of the movie needs to suit this.When the movie started, I was immediately surprised by the colourful opening cinematic. Colours... Actual colours! This doesn't mean that the movie is an all-out goof-fest like the Joel Schumacher Batman films though, but it's self-aware and it knows what it is. It's a comic-book adaption, and there is an obvious limit to how serious the audience can take this. That being said; the jokes are subtle enough to be noticed, but don't get in the way of the story. Whereas in something like Marvel's Thor movies for example, I thought the jokes were very cringe-worthy and were more distracting than funny.The acting overall is outstanding, and I don't think I can name a single actor in this flick who got on my nerves, or looked like they were not performing well. Harley Quinn stands-out, and it seems like the director knew this as well, since they do focus quite a bit on her character and her antics. The Joker is a different story... It seems like you either love or hate Jared Leto's performance, but I'm personally quite indifferent to it. It seems like he's trying to find the right balance for the character, and perhaps in a future Batman-movie he will achieve this. In Suicide Squad however, I didn't think his performance was particularly noteworthy. I will freely admit though, that this is most likely due to the previous great actors having played the Joker, so there are a lot of high expectations he has to live up to. I'm not writing him off just yet.Will Smith as Deadshot is hard to criticize for me, because it's very obvious that he's mainly just starring as himself here. He even has those typical Will Smith moments where he makes wise-cracking commentary, almost as if he's just improvising his lines on the spot. It's hard for me to criticize him, because I actually enjoy seeing him do what he does best. When I stepped out of the theater, my boyfriend and I actually caught ourselves calling Deadshot by Will Smith instead. This is by no means a bad thing though. His performance reminded me a lot of his role as Hancock, which I thought was the best part of that movie.There's a big focus on action (rightfully so), and most of it looks great. A lot of other action movies can often get kind of nauseating because of the motion-blur and the swirly CGI effects, but this was never the case in Suicide Squad. I do have to admit that the editing is a bit choppy at times. Just by the way this movie is edited, I have a feeling that there's a lot of unused footage on the editing-room's floor (or should I say hard-drive?). The choppy editing never distracts from the movie too much though.Another gripe that a lot of reviewers have is the music. Yeah, there are a handful of songs used in here (especially classic rock tunes), but they fit the tongue in cheek atmosphere and it never got to a point where I thought it was ridiculous. Of course this comes down to personal preference as well.One thing that I do agree on with the critics, is the fact that the plot gets very predictable and kind of loses the audience's interest near the end. I won't spoil any of it, but it's very cliché, which is a shame. It's an obvious and rightful criticism, but I don't feel this takes away from the great chemistry that the characters share, or the great acting performances in general. Suicide Squad trumps both Man of Steel and Batman v Superman in nearly every regard, and it's an example of how to do a comic-book adaption well. It's saddening to see a lot of critics willing to burn this movie at the stake for things that are pretty minor compared to the many things it does really well (especially for a super-hero movie).I for one hope that Suicide Squad performs well enough at the box office to warrant a sequel, which I will eagerly await. If you are a DC fan and still debating if you should see this: go watch it in theaters. I can't imagine you will be disappointed.",Suicide Squad
525,leosmith-11166,A Disappointing Mess,3,12 August 2016,"I had quite high expectations for this film when the trailer came out a year ago- Who doesn't like a good DC Film? You see, Up until now, i felt quite strongly that DC made better films then Marvel. Heck, I even liked Batman vs Superman. But to be honest, this film made Ang Lees Hulk or Ghost Rider look like Oscar winners. The Dialogue is extremely sloppy- Unflowing, unnatural and weird sounding conversations continue throughout the movie. The script is a complete mess, and if a Classic like Taxi Driver was written in a few days, this was probably written in ten seconds. The Actors are trying far too hard, and their performances come out as awkward and sloppy. Especially Jared Leto who seemed like he was trying to do a demonic impersonation of Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean. I know it's not fair to compare anyone to Heath Ledger, but this wasn't even near what Ledger pulled off, or Nicholson. I think Cesar Romero was even a better joker.....But the joker and the other characters formation wasn't even slightly the actors fault. They were given a dud script from a guy who shouldn't be making films at such a high budget. I don't know what Warner Bros saw in hiring David Ayer to Direct and write a script of this calibre, and i don't think they even know why they did it. But hey, its an action movie right? I at least could enjoy some dumb but cool action sequences. Well sadly, this film didn't even give me that much. Not only were the Action Sequences boring and pointless, the humour was also a mess. More cliché annoying jokes attempting to appeal to 12 year olds make up a cringeworthy ride. My Faith in DC films has been lost, Now that Christopher Nolan is gone and Zack Snyder is wearing out.

527,born_naughty,Watch the extended version,8,19 December 2020,"I hated the original release. It just felt like a complete mess. There was no clear plot, just scenes. Many of those scenes and interactions were very cool but everything seemed underdeveloped. The plot was quickly lost and character motivations were unclear. I saw that movie 4 years ago and now I'm watching the extended version and it turned into a really cool movie. I don't know exactly the differences between this and the original as my viewings were too far between but I had no trouble following the plot. The main characters all got to shine and all got proper background and motivation. If this was how the movie was originally released it would have been the most fun movie of the year. Tie that together with the director's cut of Batman vs Superman that I also enjoyed (though I already enjoyed the original), the Zack Snyder Cut of Justice League that's coming and I'm excited again for the DC universe.",Suicide Squad
528,regula1,"Guardians of the Galaxy-like fun hits all the right keys, just not in the right order to gain access to greatness",7,5 August 2016,"It's now two days until my birthday, and I really wanted Suicide Squad to be my early birthday dream come true. What I got was not as bad as all the critics have been saying, but at the same time it just feels like it misses the mark somehow.First of all, let's deal with the obvious: this film is basically DC's answer to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Both have criminals band together to face a powerful enemy (both with a combination of swords and guns), both use classic pop and rock songs, and both end up establishing the direction of their respective universes.So the music, in the trailers for this movie, the editing acumen to meld action with music was nothing short of genius, but in the finished product, while all the songs are good, they come up so often,so unnecessarily, and sometimes as a very odd choice. Literally, Bohemian Rhapsody plays at the very end for no reason at all over the exact footage of the second trailer.Moving on, though, this film is not necessarily about the action, of which there is plenty of but you doesn't really engage you. It's about the chemistry between the cast, and they fall in three categories.The breakout stars of this film, Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, and Jared Leto's Joker, all steal the show in every scene they appear (of which, Joker appears much less than you might think). In short, Suicide Squad is basically all about these three, the rest of the cast just supports them.Then there are the perfectly competent characters who are there and make for great action sequences. Chief among these are Diablo, played by Jay Hernandez, and Katana, played by Karen Fukuhara. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller is meant to be a chief player in this film, and in all honesty she pulls off her performance wonderfully, but her lack of screen-time in much of the film's action leaves her just shy of making the first tier.Finally, there's the characters who were either supposed to be important but really aren't and those who are incredibly forgettable. Case in point: the relationship between Special Forces officer Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman, and June Moone/Enchantress, played by Cara Delevingne, is supposed to be one of torn emotions between saving their love or saving the world, but when it all plays out the resolution does not feel satisfying. Also, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang's only cool moment is him sipping a beer during an intense firefight.In summary, let me say that this film is NOT as bad as the critics say it is. They lambaste the poor editing, shallow characters, and rushed pace, and while there is ground for criticism in these ares, Suicide Squad delivers more than enough thrills and laughs to make the price of admission worth it. If I were to change one thing, though: I would go back in time and tell the marketing department to not give away so much of the film in the trailers, because really a TON of stuff in the trailers basically sums up the movie and there's not as much left to find out in the theater.",Suicide Squad
529,bbv-69237,Surprisingly Entertaining,7,16 September 2016,"Despite some obvious flaws in the plot and some over acting and CGI bad guys, the film is enjoyable to watch (mostly).I just hope that they do realise that the movie succeeded IN SPITE of Will Smith and NOT BECAUSE of Will Smith. In fact if I had known he had such a major speaking part, I probably would have waited for the On-Line release. Maybe they do realise he ain't the movie and therefore didn't over-advertise his involvement??Clearly the glue that holds it together is the Harley character, and I thought the Joker character was good, if maybe a little too many scenes. Deadshot (Will) is well played mostly (some scenes over-acted) and unlike other Will Smith 'movies' he doesn't dominate the whole movie. Yep - a Will Smith movie that was not all about Will Smith - pleasantly surprising.Worth the money and time.",Suicide Squad

So I'm asking this to myself...""why is Ben Afflect in a bat suit?""Okay...let's pretend Ben Affleck is Batman, than wouldn't he have mastered the element of disguise? Could he not have picked a different time to arrest Will Smith?And Jared Leto plays a Joker that makes every Dark Knight fan give up on the Batman series from nauseation.And this is just the first 15 minutes.

532,Parks,Why Do They Keep Dropping The Ball?,5,19 November 2016,"So look, it's not as bad as BvS. For two reasons:a) No pointless pseudo-philosophical claptrap about gods and mortals that doesn't actually mean anythingb) No Jesse Eisenberg doing his Joker-Without-Makeup bitAnd there are good things in this film. There are good actors in it. There are no awful actors (hi Jesse!) in it. The idea is unusual and interesting. There's quite a lot of action. But yet... it falls short of expectations. It's frustrating. Just when you want it to fly, it flounders. The key issue is that I really didn't care about anyone but Deadshot. Harley is fun, but her romance with Mr. J is under-written and unconvincing. So she really only comes across as nutty and wanton which is hard to care about.To put this in perspective, I cared a lot more and actually liked Harley in the animated series. It's not Margot Robbie's fault. She's actually terrific and almost pulls it off. But to get her over the line she needed a more fleshed out relationship with the Joker. And a better Joker. I'm not sure Jared Leto or the people who wrote this movie got the Joker - or why Harley needs him. In this movie, he never comes across as anything but a sadistic psycho - which he is - but in other incarnations he also has a brilliantly manipulative and devious side - appearing vulnerable or in need of help to suck in his victims just before he slips in the knife. It's not hard - we've seen it in previous versions of this character. But not here. Harley just loves him because she does. End of. Keep up. It's not very satisfying.The plot is pretty flimsy, but I can get over that. Marvel have done flimsier but get away with it because they seem to understand how to make audiences care about characters. I'm not saying DC are incapable of this. I really hope they up their game and learn a few lessons from Feige. But based on the three DCEU movies thus far, they'd better start studying his playbook hard. I know ""Suicide Squad"" and ""BvS"" made a lot of money but so do ""Transformers"" movies and ""Suicide Squad"" is closer in spirit to those sorts of films than Marvel right now.",Suicide Squad
533,sedativchunk,Jumbled mess from start to finish,5,20 August 2016,"Let me begin by saying I love DC Universe and despite its hate, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Batman vs. Superman"" and thought it was a pretty solid movie. I can't say the same for Suicide Squad. I was really looking forward to this movie but ultimately felt disappointed when I left the theater. This moving lacks in everything from acting, writing, storytelling, emotion, direction, editing, and even the sound mixing. Suicide Squad simply put is a jumbled mess, especially in the writing and editing department. Scenes are thrown together all over the place. There's no pacing and no proper ""arc"" to the story. We spend a significant portion of the movie introducing the characters but not enough time actually growing to like any of them. One of the things that really bothered me about the story line and pacing (related to editing as well) is that, there was no real motivation to initially form the Suicide Squad by Viola Davis's character Waller. She just happened to put them together, then immediately following there was a big, terrorist attack by the evil enchantress and her brother. She just then happens to have the Suicide Squad available. Wouldn't have it made more sense for the terrorist attack by the enchantress to motivate wanting to use extremist ""bad guys"" to fight her and not just conveniently have them? This is but one of many poor areas in both writing and editing of the film where things didn't make sense.Another thing that didn't make sense was Joker's involvement in the story. His character ultimately felt completely pointless to the storyline of this film. I almost feel as if they just threw him into this movie to make people want to see it because it would have the ""Joker"" attached. I firmly believe the writing, story, and editing would have fit better if they weren't trying to give us some silly and pointless side-plots with the Joker. This movie also spends too much time back-tracking on past events about how the characters go to where they are instead of actually letting us learn who they are by dealing with their predicaments and situations in the movie. I have no real comments about Leto's Joker because his character was ultimately wasted and he never really had his proper place in the spotlight. Furthermore Suicide Squad is way too aggressive in throwing in classic-rock soundtrack anywhere where it seemed fit. I can't believe this is something I have to make a point about, but it's so bad that I have to. I don't mind a solid soundtrack to a film, but Suicide Squad thoroughly abused it. Instead of tastefully throwing in classic soundtrack from time-to-time in an effort to tell the story better, the movie just abuses it, throwing in classic soundtracks wherever it seemed fit. Furthermore, they often use the music in at wildly inappropriate times, and also blasts over dialog to the point where you couldn't hear what the characters were saying. How bad does a AAA-budget Hollywood film have to be to not even have a proper audio-mix? I ultimately felt like this movie was trying too hard to piggyback off of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" with the success of their soundtrack instead of trying to be original about it.If you've actually seen this movie, ask yourself the following question; who was the main character of the film? Was it Deadshot? Or Harley Quinn? Or the Mexican guy with fire, or the lizard man? Did you even remember the names of some of these characters if you aren't some die-hard comic book fan? And can you also properly describe some of the characters and why they're important? The point I am making here; the movie is easily forgettable. It failed to tell me a story or make me care about any of these characters. In fact, it made me not care about some of the characters so much, that I either forgot their names overnight or forgot they were even in the movie. Are those the qualities of a good quality, Hollywood film? Now the movie did try in some ways to do this. They gave some backstory to all the characters, especially the big-names like Deadshot played by Will Smith. Will Smith was fighting for his daughter, and wanted to prove he was more than a ""piece of crap"" serial killer. But other than his character, who did they make us care about? Ultimately this movie is just a big mess. They tried to put too many characters in one film without us actually caring about any of them. This is easily a forgettable movie, which is a shame. It had a lot going for it. The action was solid, the costumes were solid, I liked most of the cast. But the story-line and character development were severely lacking. Follow by the the poor timeline of events followed by the mediocre editing makes this one film, I have to say you should pass on on this one. 5/10",Suicide Squad

535,JontheLobsterLover,A step in the right direction,7,5 August 2016,"This movie is definitely not like Batman v. Superman, unlike what a lot of other reviews say. In fact, this movie is pretty much exactly what I thought it would be: Fun!The three characters that were the driving force behind this movie are: Harley Quinn (no surprise there), Deadshot, and surprisingly El Diablo. From the get go it was a given that Harley Quinn was going to be a major factor for this movie doing well. Because she has such a following with fans, her big screen debut is a major deciding factor in which way this movie could turn; either horribly bad, or amazingly awesome. Thankfully, the latter is how it turned out. Margot Robbie was so perfect in the roll it's almost scary. The main thing the three characters have in common is the emotional back story they bring: Harley Quinn and her extreme love and devotion to Mr. J; Deadshot's love for his daughter; and the tragic story behind El Diablo's family. You connect with them, and even though they're bad guys you actually want them to win in a way. Characters like Slipknot (very short screen time), Captain Boomerang, and Killer Croc, didn't really add much. I'm glad they were there because it added just a tiny more depth to the whole ""team"" thing, but if they were gone they wouldn't be missed. I love Jared Leto, but I have to say I am not a fan of his Joker. Sure he looked cool, but he just didn't feel like a good Joker to me. The Joker is supposed to be a fun villain that you enjoy watching on screen because you don't know what he's going to do. I did not feel that way about Leto's version. The fact that he didn't have a lot of screen time was a good thing. The small cameos made by certain Justice League members were done beautifully.Overall I really did enjoy this movie, and I think this is definitely a great step in bringing this universe together.",Suicide Squad
536,kikoydaba3,"great cast and surprisingly fun, but generic and formulaic at best... ruined by studio meddling",5,3 January 2020,"Suicide Squad is a solid and enjoyable movie about superhero villains lead by a terrific cast, but whose overall story, incoherent theme, and mired production prevents it from becoming more than a typical summer blockbuster.The movie's main strength is derived from its great cast chemistry. Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, and Will Smith as Amanda Waller, Harley Quinn, and Deadshot, respectively, are terrific, playing off one another perfectly. The strong cast makes the movie enjoyable.In terms of writing, the movie shows the motivations of the characters to follow orders imposed by Amanda Waller, leader of the team. The audience is shown enough background and character origin to sympathize, but their motivations are not explored or challenged in a meaningful and resonant way. The story amounts to little because it lacks a coherent overarching theme that unites the characters. Harley Quinn has her romance subplot with joker, played by Jared Leto, where he rescues her from prison. Deadshot is a for-hire-assassin whose work conflicts with his daughter's relationship. Other supporting characters such as Colonel Rick Flag, Captain Boomerang, El Diablo, Killer Croc, Enchantress, and Katana are given proper motivations but they fall within the same assessment of failing to explore or challenge them. Colonel Rick Flag, in particular, has a good subplot that revolves around her lover Doctor June Moone who is simultaneously the villain of the film, Enchantress. Aside from having an incoherent theme, Enchantress is a weak villain, not physically, but motivationally and who is rather formulaic. The movie could have been stronger if Joker was the main villain. Joker is instead a bad parody with his awful tattoos, ""damaged"", punk, and gangster personality.David Ayer's direction continues the Snyder influence on the DCEU, mixed with comedy and elements of Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy. The editing is alright when it switches from present to past through recollection of character origins. The soundtrack is quite trippy and is one of the better parts of the movie.Suicide squad had great potential which was squandered by studio interference. The sort-of sequel, to be directed by James Gunn, hopefully, is an improvement by giving the director more free-rein and creative leeway.5/10",Suicide Squad

545,pandrews2104,Not the DeadPool/Guardians Response DC Hoped For,2,6 August 2016,"Before the comic book fans decry the subject line let me state that I read comics or graphic novels if you want to get into semantics too. Probably not as much as the guys and gals tagged ass fanboy and fan-girls but enough with Spidey, The Avengers, Fantastic Four, Superman and Batman - hell, even the ancient Legion of Super Heroes form the 60's.So - that was too much intro to say that Suicide Squad was a fairly incoherent mess that was shot clearly enough for you to witness the mess and also be disappointed at the talent wasted that could have made something special.Will Smith and Margot Robie were in great form and the film is not unwatchable like a Michael Bay Transformer destructothon. And while I am fully sick of comic book/Super Hero movies always being about a world class catastrophic event or evil that will wipe out/take over ALL the Earth...it's nine to see them just take care of some every day thing...just keep Iran from nuking Israel and we have a film.But the film goes mystic, with no explanation, our heroes are released because Superman is dead. Now, if your premise rides on the most famous and powerful superhero now being RECENTLY dead, they owe us a flashback or two, like they did for every character in the movie, including the now missing, though never pronounced dead, Batman...who shows up in a couple of scenes for no apparent reason except that someone was telling a story about him, so he appears in their tell a story flashback exposition.So - at this point we have dead superman, missing Batman and confused Flash, because lo and behold, in one criminal's flashback, it appears that guy gets busted by The Flash. And that's the last we see of the Flash. and based on the fights that come later, The Flash would have been their best superhero..at least we understand what his power really contributes to the fight.You see, that is the killing point moving forward after some higher up in some black ops version of the CIA or NSA or FBI (I saw Bourne last week and it will scramble you brain with all the code crap)decided that a group of jailed meta-humans (X-Men to Marvel fans)who are serving multiple life sentences for horrific crimes, including the strangest choice among them from a logical point, Harley Quinn who used to be The Joker's Psychiatrist but became obsessed with him and fell in love with him and became as psychotic as him. All fine and good but exactly what power does mercurial, manic, goofy, psychotic thin female with decent martial arts skills with no body armor armed with one 14 round pistol and a baseball bat actually over an gang banger? Much less these meta-enhanced alien spirit people beings or whatever they are. (Trust me, We agree never told) And besides Dead-shot, who can shoot any firearm he finds and hit any target he aims at plus he never seems to need to reload either. So, we know his thing. And the Fire guy, well, he shoots fire when he gets over his angst and gets all Bruce Banner. But then we still have about three more to deal with, A boomerang guy who throws a boomerang that spy's on people, for a little while. Glad they had that! And some other guy who just seemed to hang around and look tense. And they are led by a Special Forces guy who, of course, used to have a relationship with one of the main bad women. That plot description is close to all you really get out this movie. Oh - forgot..there's a guy who's big and is skinned like a big crocodile but with a round face so he just looks like The Thing from Fantastic Four. See, this is where the story, already non-nonsensical, makes things worse. The plan is to send this squad in to fight these two bad people and save the world for a reduction in their sentence, and because they have families to that might want to keep living on the world. But notice, I just called them bad people - that's because the movie never defines exactly what these people's powers or weakness's are. At one point we are led to believe that they are immensely powerful - let's face it - world destroying powerful - yet near the end, The Joker's girlfriend, armed only with a blade or a bat lights into the super powerful baddie and the bad women has trouble deflecting the blow with her own sword. Not so damn powerful there or that psychotic gal should be at training camp for the Yankees. None of these characters ability to be superhuman is ever explained to those of us who haven;t read the comics. So I was lost trying to figure out the power ranking and who do what to who. It was an incoherent mush.In Guardians things were explained quickly with humor, action and panache. Same with the Avengers. And Man of Steel and Batman v Superman made coherent sense as well.

546,thedukeofmovietown,Juggling 10 balls and catches 5,5,31 October 2016,"The highly controversial and highly anticipated film that furthers the story of the DC Universe. Suicide Squad tells a Dirty Dozen style story drawn around the street level villains in DC Comics who after imprisonment, are forced to work together to go on a suicide mission to save the city from other-worldly enemies.The critics really have been tearing this film a new one claiming that it's hot garbage, mostly because it's not the Dark Knight in my estimation but the reality of the situation is that it's not as bad as all that. The action is cool, the acting is good and the characters are very interesting and fun to watch interact. The reality of the situation is that this movie is actually 5 or 6 different movies all going on at once. Some are really good and some are really bad but giving it one rating overall doesn't do the movie's individual parts justice. Suicide squad is a well-intentioned Deadshot movie about family and kids, a good Diablo movie about redemption, a Lifetime grade movie about Harley Quinn and her abusive douche bag boyfriend The Joker(who by the way, contrary to popular belief, I think was supposed to be an unlikable character. He's still a villain remember?! The Justice League has to fight him!), a half baked love story between Captain Flag and Enchantress and whatever screen time there was leftover got spent on everyone else so Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang etc were forced to fight it out for relevance or purpose in the film. That's where the problems come in. The movie is so preoccupied with juggling all 25 different balls it has in the air that it drops about 10 of them in the process. I could go into depth about what the movie gets right and wrong from my perspective but it all comes down to the fact that there were too many working parts for them to come together correctly.

549,DanielRobertRoss,The best DCU film so far,2,21 August 2016,"After the divisive critical reaction and box office mediocrity of Batman v. Superman, I went into Suicide Squad not expecting much. Surprisingly, I liked a lot about the film. Thankfully, the portentous gods vs men ""do we need heroes?"" waffling from BvS is nowhere to be found. David Ayer knows that action can be fun, as apposed to Zack Snyder's heavy handed growling and yelling matches. And the ""rogues called together to do good"" has echoes of 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy, one of the best MCU films. And the anarchist spirit is a fun break from the somber tone of the previous films, to a point where it starts to feel like it's not actually part of the same universe, despite Ben Affleck showing up as Batman in a cameo.Jared Leto's Joker is a different beast then Heath Ledger's portrayal in The Dark Knight, and in the DC cinematic universe, it works surprisingly well. Picture Hannibal Lector combined with Patrick Bateman. It's a shame there isn't more of him in the film. If they make The Joker the main villain of a Batman film, I'd pay all the money to see that.Margot Robbie is the standout performance of the film, she nailed the character of Harley Quinn perfectly. Will Smith is good, given how little character background he's given. The rest are hit and miss. Crocodile man-monsters, ninjas and pyromaniacs.The negatives? The choppy editing of the first 15 minutes is annoying, the villain is pretty forgettable, the character intros are hit and miss, and the overuse of pop songs gets old fast.

(Story of Avengers 1, Avengers 2, Batman, etc). There is nothing new about the story, but the director David Ayer did a great job introducing the characters and building the story. Poor characterization, some poor dialogues and erratic screenplay are the side effects of a week story line. Except Deadshot, Harley Quinn and Diablo, the other characters seemed to be underdeveloped. The Good: - Jai courney as the Boomerang was a great comic relief and he reminds us of DCs attempts to include comedy in their apparent Dark and gritty films. - Diablo was fun to watch, though some things at the end of the movie regarding this character are un explained. - Great directing within the constrains of the story. - Fantastic lead by Will SmithThe Bad - Poor CGI - Villain(s) with poor motive - Viola Davis' poor characterization - Wrong timing for comedy. - You clearly see the audience and critics making an impact on the film. DC was blamed for being too dark unlike marvel and you can see the screen writers deliberately including funny one liners in un- necessary scenes.Overall, it is a great summer film. If you step into the movie hall with less or zero expectations (like me) you are going to have fun.Special mention about the Joker.Jared Leto: The method actor who underwent a lot of physical and mental training is put down as he gets less screen time to show his skills off. It was reported that Jared Leto shut himself from the world and completely transformed into the role of Joker. Will Smith also admitted he never got to know the real actor behind. That said, you will go to the movies to see all the talent unused and given less screen time.",Suicide Squad

I watched it on tv tonight from start to finish, enduring the ads and hoping that it might at sone point turn the corner and improve but to no avail. Uninspiring plot, messy characters plodding along with the only memorably elements beings the few embedded legendary score tracks. Glad it was on tv at home and not in a cinema.",Suicide Squad
552,TheFirstExecutioner,"It's Not a Great Movie, but it is the Best from the DC Universe Movies",5,8 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is finally here after the huge anticipation. It is the story of a group of villains called Task Force X, a.k.a. Suicide Squad, who are sent on a mission to save the world in Midway City. The movie is similar to Batman v Superman from a critical standpoint, but the viewing experience for me was far different.The biggest strength this movie has is the characters. Their introductions are done in a cool and funny way. Will Smith as Deadshot is very likable and funny. He brings humanity to the role and has some awesome action scenes. Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn and super entertaining to watch. Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, and Joel Kinneman as Rick Flagg are all really good too. Jared Leto's Joker is a really cool portrayal of the character and I can't wait to see him in future films. But by far the standout performance for me is Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. She is so dark and at times cruel. Watching these characters made this movie a ton of fun. Unfortunately, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and El Diablo are the only ones who are given any real depth and backstory. The biggest weaknesses this movie has are the story and villains. The mission the Suicide Squad is sent on honestly makes no sense for the type of people they are. The story is very weak and relies only on its comedy during certain scenes. Some of the decisions made by certain characters don't make sense. I won't say who it is but the villain is by far the worst part of this movie. The villains in this movie are worse than Lex Luthor and Doomsday in Batman v Superman. Some of the songs work for the tone and others come out of nowhere. Overall, Suicide Squad is a really fun movie. From a critical standpoint, this is equivalent to Batman v Superman, but I actually found myself enjoying this movie. I was having a ton of fun with the movie even though I could blatantly see the numerous problems the movie has. I definitely think it's a better film than Batman v Superman and a little better than Man of Steel. So for me, it is the best DC Universe film. If you're a comic book fan of these characters or the DC Universe films, I would recommend seeing it.

553,SeanDTheFilmMaker,Even white trash needs super heroes they can identify with,1,11 March 2018,"This is like if you took good comic book characters, got them hooked on smack, broke them out of a methadone clinic, and decided to make a pointless movie with them. Its really just ""Mean faced"" dialogue then ""round house kicks"" then ""shooting"" then ""mean face dialogue"". Its text book writing, ya know, if that text book was ""Writing scripts for dummies"" the fact they tried to pipe in an emotional arc with the one character having a daughter was absolutely laughable. You literally do not give a damn about a single character. And harlequin is just disgusting to even look at. Actually just her ""look"" alone made me not watch it until years later...Will smith was the only reason I gave it a chance. Thinking maybe it was bad advertising and the thing could be surprisingly good. But nope. Between stupid dialog, stupid plot lines, i cant bend my mind enough to accept this as a form of entertainment. Not without getting myself hooked on smack, check in to a methadone clinic, then watch it on their tv. Just to stay positive the one thing I liked about the movie was the budget, Must have been a nice budget.",Suicide Squad
554,PeterWorthers,"Movies making money is easy, movies that are worth spending the money to see is a lot harder",5,11 August 2016,"Spoiler alert Puddins****** Finally, after waiting so long DCs answer to the Guardians of the Galaxy is here. The trailers more than built up hype surrounding these 'lesser known' DC characters and with our first REAL live action Harley Quinn and the promise of The Joker and Batman added to the mix it made the possibility of this movie being a hit a sure thing.However after seeing the movie it seems like the hype was just that, hype. Sadly the trailer and soundtrack may have been the best parts of the movie.I think that's why I'm having trouble writing this, I wanted so badly and was so sure this movie would be good, I felt bad when halfway though it I realized I was bored and didn't really care anymore.Right from the first scene we're thrown into the story and as you would expect with a large cast, some of the characters don't get a good enough back story for you to really care about them. I understand they are bad guys but still, shouldn't I be given a good reason to root for them seeing as how they are the 'hero' of the film.You can tell that Deadshot and Harley are the main characters, Enchantress is supposed to be one too, but the way her story is told so quickly you find it really hard to care about what happens to her . Killer Crock and El Diablo are just there, plain and simple, their back stories are not explored enough and they provide nothing to further the plot, they are just THERE.The scenes were cut weird, at times it seemed less of a movie and more of a wild dream sequence and some things just plain didn't make sense. Like the plot. This had to have been the dumbest reasoning to bring these villains together, THERE WAS NO REASON FOR IT. A military unit or some of the super heroes around could have taken care of this much easier, why go to all this trouble? It seriously seemed like the wrote the action parts, forgot to put a plot in and threw together something assuming no one would really notice because you'd be too busy looking at Harleys butt every 10 minutes.A few things got to me so if you would allow me to vent for a moment:1.Harley was unneeded; all she was there for really was to tie the Joker into the movie and for sex appeal. THAT'S ALL. The movie would have gone on without her and you know it.2.So they are all standing there right beside Deadshot who has an unlimited amount of guns and ammo to just shoot at these targets and NO ONE is wearing hearing protection? Seriously? 3.Speaking of Harley, I've never seen so many ass shots of a superhero since Clooney in the bat suit. I mean really, she must drop a lot of stuff because she was CONSTANTLY bent over it seemed.4.The Joker: Leto was OK in the role; I look forward to seeing him more. But in this movie he was pointless, other than to show how Harley became the way she is; he was reduced to ""Hey everyone, remember me? I'm still here. OK enjoy the movie."" Not quite the presence Ledger was.5.The war room scene. ""What if Superman turned bad? We would need to defeat him."" With a sharp shooter, a crocodile, a dude that throws boomerangs and a lady clown? Really? THAT is the best you can come up with to stop Superman even though in Batman V Superman you were introduced to Kryptonite? Waller really should have gone back to the drawing board.6.Who ever played Flag and Deadshots daughter were TERRIBLE. I mean they were worse than the new characters in Independence Day Resurgence. It was painful to watch any scene they were in.7.So they give everyone their gear back and Harley has her cell phone in it. Provided we don't know how long she's been in there, but how is her phone still fully charged? Plus the guards had to have known what was in those boxes, how did she not think that Waller had the thing bugged or traced? 8.If Flag had a thing with the Enchantress why would they send him to kill her? He would emotionally compromise the mission. I mean come on; didn't they watch the 2009 Star Trek?9.Flag was a really bad leader; ""Deadshot don't do the thing"" Deadshot does the thing. ""Stay in line or I'll kill you."" They don't stay in line. ""We're going there to stop this."" They don't go there. He must have learned his leadership skills from the same place he learned to act.10.If it was THAT easy for the Joker to just break into the 'Maximum security cell' then it begs to differ that it was probably just as easy to break out.There were more but I assume you get the picture.Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying to NOT go see the movie. It's your typical final summer blow out of a movie, and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But if you were looking for something along the lines of what Marvel is putting out nowadays, don't hold your breath.In the end, the Suicide Squads greatest success and failure is its trailer. It was good enough to give all of us hope that THIS would be the movie that finally shut all the haters up and finally give Marvel a run for their money. But it didn't even come close.I have a brilliant idea DC. How about you stop trying so badly to have what Marvel has and just be you.",Suicide Squad
555,wackywhovian11,Eck...what can I say,5,11 September 2016,"Eck...what can I say about this film that can make you guys give it a viewing. Mmm well is a Superheroes DC film so that is a plus. And that's about it, really. I can see why people aren't really liking this film because the idea is a bit stank. This lady brings together the worse superheroes criminals the worlds has ever seen to help the world. Here's the question why would the bad guy want to help out the world that hate them? I did enjoy the Harley Quinn and Joker characters, who doesn't want a little craziness with their movie? But I think The Joker was a bit tame to be honest. Deathstroke was cool with this bond with his little girl and wanting to be ""good"" for her but come on where was the bad ass sharpshooter that doesn't take crap from no one. I didn't see that in this film. The other characters Diablo ooh fireboy didn't want to hurt anyone so he didn't use his powers for most of the film until a certain point which was a bit...boring. Killer Croc barely got any scene time except for swimming in his cell...big whoopee-do Mr Boomerang I didn't care about at all. All he did was hit on the cute girls in the film and didn't do anything with his so called magical boomerang...you got a magic weapon use it. The lady with the sword Katina she was cool with her soul-eater sword but she could have done more. The film for me was fun but not worth it to be honest. I wait for Redbox to watch it, if you really want to watch it but don't want to spend too much money on it. The story itself made no sense to be honest. Why would they get all those bad guys and leave Joker out? Oh sure Joker is mad as a hatter but still he could have bought something more to the party than what he did bring. And don't get my started on the Witch character her special effect were lame. It felt like something out of the 90s, if you've seen the film you know what I mean.",Suicide Squad
556,chimera3,Not Worth Your Time,1,21 September 2017,"When it comes to watching this failed attempt at art, I don't honestly know where to begin. When it comes to movies about the ""Suicide Squad,"" I prefer the animated ones. Those were actually somewhat more tolerable. This live-action filth was not. I watched this movie with my middle brother under our own steam and neither of us were impressed. First and foremost, what was the deal with Will Smith and Margot Robbie? It was like they were the stars of the movie and everyone else was just filler. With those two egos bouncing around like a pinball or two, it was hard to take them seriously. Margot has a voice that is as grating as nails on a chalkboard and she was definitely not the type to play Harley Quinn. I can think of about a couple dozen of other girls that would better fit the mold...but she is not one of them.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller seemed to have just phoned it in. She looked like she was completely bored throughout the entire filming. I have great respect for Viola on a whole, but this was ridiculous. If it wasn't boredom that would have gotten her, it was confusion. She herself looked like she had no idea what was going on.And seriously, what was the deal with Jared Leto being the Joker? For all of the hype that he was given regarding the character, he was only in there for all of maybe 20 minutes and those 20 minutes were simply d-u-l-l. He is not the Joker type, much like Margot Robbie is not the Harley Quinn type. This is right up there when it comes to badness. Seriously. ""Batman v. Superman"" was revolting, ""Deadpool"" was disgusting, this was abominable. I wouldn't see this again on a bet. Too much ego, too little character development, and an absolutely ridiculous plot. This alone should have been rated R for ""repulsive.""",Suicide Squad
557,dennis_chiu1,"Jared Leto and Margot Robbie Lift ""Suicide Squad""",7,12 November 2016,"The first time I saw ""Suicide Squad"" I found that the focused too much on non-super villain Deadshot, played in the film by Will Smith (""Men in Black""; ""Independence Day""), and missed the mark. However, I saw the film a second time, I found the film better than I remembered. When Jared Leto (Academy Award winner for ""Dallas Buyers Club"") is on screen as the Joker with Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie (""The Wolf of Wall Street""), I was captivated. Their scenes are like ""Scarface"" meets ""Romeo & Juliet"" painted in neon carnival colors while sitting on a whirling out-of-control merry-go-round. They may be the most fascinating romantic characters portrayed on film this year, and their performances stayed with me.Writer/Director David Ayer (""Fury"") may have been too tied to the source material, DC Comics ""Legends #3"" graphic novel of the same name that self-consciously tried to humanize lesser known villains. Deadshot's story is mundane in an extraordinary world with a Dark Knight and a Man of Steel, and drags the whole film down. The film includes other lesser known villains, including Amanda Waller, (played by the brilliant Viola Davis of ""The Help""), Katana (played by martial arts star Karen Fukuhara), Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), and Rick Flag (portrayed by Joel Kinsman). But we don't ever get to know them as characters and do not match the maniacal darkness and glee found in the Joker and Harley. I believe Writer/Director David Ayer, and the producers, could have benefited from a re-write before green-lighting the screenplay to make this film from good to great.The film is helped by good cinematography by Roman Vasyanov (""Fury"") and composer Steven Price (Academy Award winner for ""Gravity""). The soundtrack relies heavily on good 70s rock ballads and hits that tries to keep the film's tempo up.I saw it in 3D and while a few shots were made more interesting, the 3D glasses darkened some scenes so much that I had to remove the glasses to see what was really going on. So, I recommend seeing the film in 2D.",Suicide Squad

562,fatemaster2003,"Unbalanced, Yet Entertaining",7,6 August 2016,"First of all, let me state this very clearly. I'm not DC fanboy nor Marvel fanboy. What I stated in my review is just a personal opinion from years of watching both DC and Marvel movies.Now, let me first stated this. Suicide Squad has the potential to become a good movie, if only the director put more time on the production and not rush things. Unfortunately, it's the opposite that happened. The unpolished gem with lots of potential in it, has been wrongly polished into a flawed gem. For me, below is the main weaknesses of the movie: 1. Plot that was too thin, shallow and dense. I might say, it's just too dense and too random for me. There's not enough background story to actually support the movie. Sure there's a bit of explanation along the way, but that still doesn't help much, given how little information they give us so far.2. Dialogues that don't make sense. For this one, I have to highlight the reasoning that were uttered by the outlaws. The reasoning seems unbelievably shallow and the action afterward also doesn't make sense. Another reason why the director should have taken his time to develop the story.3. Overshadowed members of Suicide Squad. Given the name as a squad, you should at least tell the tale in a fair manner and fair portion, right? But throughout the movie, seems to me, only Deadshot and Harley Quinn get the spotlight. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew (Croc, Boomerang, El Diablo, Slipknot and Katana) were only there to make the actions more interesting. Too bad really.4. Unnecessary appearance. Talking about this point, bring us to the appearance of Jared Leto as Joker. Sure, all fans have been waiting to see how Leto perform as Joker. While I'm pretty happy with his performance in Suicide Squad, I failed to see the significance of his appearance in the movie. Personally, I think even without Joker showing up, the movie could still progress smoothly.5. Inspiration that came too late. I admit, this one point is a bit random, but I got my reason. Throughout the movie, I saw some resemblance with Marvel's story telling. In this case, I'm going to compare Suicide Squad with Guardians of the Galaxy which also consists of former outlaws and also used lots of classic songs and some dark humor.Now, of course it's not fair if I'm only telling about the negative points. Let's see the positive points:1. Will Smith and Margot Robby. Ironically, one of the down side of the movie, also serve as the savior for Suicide Squad. Both of these marvelous actor and actress are doing really good and (David) Ayer was lucky that these two can carry the flow of the story.2. Non-Stop Actions. Without this point, Suicide Squad will turn into a very boring movie. Lucky for Ayer, this one point also managed to save the somewhat standard story out of the dark hole it almost fell into. Not the best one, but definitely enjoyable.3. Jared Leto as Joker. While I lament the unnecessary appearance of Joker in the movie, I'm actually relieved to see that Leto has shown yet another interesting version of Joker. Leto's version in this one was shown as someone psychotic crazy and yet charming. Of course we can't just compare his appearance in this one to those of Heath Ledger's just yet, as Leto's total screen time is probably not more than 8-10 minutes. It's actually interesting to see what kind of Joker will come out later on to make Batman's life a living hell.All in all, even though it's dense and shallow, but truth be told, it's still quite interesting to watch the action. At least the action is quite good (though some of it are unbelievable) and both Will Smith and Margot Robby have performed wonderfully as Deadshot and Harley Quinn.If you're looking for a movie with complex and dark story, than this is definitely not for you. But if you're the type that can go easy on the movie and just enjoy what you see, you will not regret watching it. I give it 7/10.",Suicide Squad

564,TheV2,Watchable if you reduce your expectations to 0,6,20 May 2017,"If you didn't watch the movie just because there are many negative critics, the actual movie won't be as bad as it seems. The first problem of this movie was the big hype just like in every DCEU movie. So while watching the movie just don't expect anything.What I really loved about the movie was the performance of everyone. Especially Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot made some boring phases watchable. This interpretation of Joker was very different from all the other Joker's we've seen. Still it wasn't bad and Jared Leto made the best of it. Now when it comes to negative points there are many small factors. One would be that there hasn't been much process during the story. The plot didn't use the full potential. Also it was difficult to relate to some characters, because the background of the characters weren't really ""shown"". They were more like ""told"" to the audience. Another reason for that would be that the mood was changed so fast so you couldn't feel with the characters. Despite of the first few minutes cinematography wasn't really creative. And while the selection of the songs were good, this movie could have really need some more dramatic background score. All in all, it's watchable, if you just try to get enjoyed by the performances.",Suicide Squad
565,thechair,A missed opportunity but still entertaining...,7,6 August 2016,"'Sometimes I could just kill myself' said Jack Nicholson's Joker in 1989 before putting a gun to his head and pulling the trigger, frightening the bejeezers out of Kim Basinger. We've come a long way in 27 DC years, because now we have a whole team of nutjobs all willing to put their necks on the line in Suicide Squad (2016; 123 mins). Kinda willing, anyway, if willing means doing what Viola Davis' Amanda Waller tells you because you have a Snake Plissken-style head exploder inserted into your neck. Thus coerced, and commanded by goodie Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), baddies Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Capt. Boomerang (really?) (Jai Courtnay) and a host of others form the squad and set out todo stuff. Warner Bros/DC really needed a pick me up after the critically- mauled Batman vs Superman earlier in the year. That film has gone on to make $870 million and change worldwide, but there is an extended universe to consider and fan faith can only take a series so far at the box- office. Have they got one? Well, kinda. It's a film that starts very strongly. For a good half hour there is heaps of fun, actual fun, to be had as the squad are introduced, quirky stats and titles coming up alongside them as they are fought and caught by certain familiar vigilantes. It could have been annoying but it works and it promises much. It felt like I wanted to learn more about this world and I was enjoying being in it. The cast, too, works for the most part. It is inevitable that some members will be squeezed in order to make room for the big guns, and an opportunity for some real inter-team sniping is largely missed, but everybody gets a scene or a bit of a scene, and Robbie and Smith are very watchable, the former pretty much stealing the show as expected. Director David Ayer (End of Watch, Fury), a pretty sombre character himself, doesn't sell all of their moments as seductively as he should but neither does he drop too many clangers. The only two that come up short are Kinnaman, a man who must have a terrific agent because he is quite simply boringly awful in everything ever, and Jared Leto. The latter's Joker will be a matter of personal taste. He does a decent job selling nuts and his goons are great but I'm not his biggest fan at the best of times and, having loved Heath Ledger's incarnation, this was not the best of times. So the team is mostly decent and a good tone is set—one that is consistent with the darker DC world and at the same time brighter; the film's look is pretty good, so we're all set andthen someone lost focus. Just as with BvS, coherence is this film's biggest problem. There is a WTF? moment to challenge Batman's crappy dream sequence about half way through, and suddenly we are in a story that just doesn't work well enough. It still feels enjoyable because of all the personalities and the fighting and whatnot, but it's all over the place, and the central plot ends up feeling and looking like something from 80s flick Masters of the Universe. Not a comparison anyone at WB would want drawn, I'm sure. There is an inherent schism in the DC world due to the vast power variance across its chief heroes and there is some of that here. Marvel had the same problem with The Avengers but it was overcome with ease by concentrating on the inter-team dynamic. With villains this should have been easier and there are flashes of the same but not enough to stifle creeping realisations that some of the characters, in fact most of the characters, are actually a bit pointless and ill-fitting for the story they went with, some elements of which appear lazily written (there are some shenanigans with a bomb that are just lame). But hey, you know, overall I liked it. A super-powered Dirty Dozen is a great concept and there is a lot to like in it, it's just a shame it goes wonking its way into la-la land rather than doing something more interesting with a good set of characters.",Suicide Squad

This movie however does all of this without any semblance of a sensible plot, and with the distraction of the worst 'Joker' performance ever, in a plot stream that is irrelevant to the main movie scenario. I, like many others, have been waiting for this movie for a while, but overall I was extremely disappointed. I did quite like the performance of the prolific Margot Robbie - I seem to have seen her in 3 movies in the last 6 weeks - and Will Smith was passable as Deadshot, but the others were pretty poor.

The acting is as good as it can be with what the actors had to work with. The villain is not well set up at all, and the finale feels unsatisfying since it can be identically compared to 'The Amazing Spider-man', 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' and 'Teenage mutant ninja turtles (2014).

To me,it's just a game of who can one up each other with one liners and zingers. I didn't laugh. I did not find the humor in it's constant sarcasm and over the top plot. The Joker seemed to be on bath salts and Harley Quinn just wanted a Manwich meal (her libido was on hyperdrive) No movie needs to be over two hours and the ending credits I'd have to say was the best part of the film.

569,zanghi_james,2016 was not the best year for DC in Theaters,6,7 December 2019,"Everyone thought 2016 was going to be a good year for DC with two big-budget action films going into theaters that would include so many characters fans had been wanting to see either finally on the silver screen or in more better forms. Instead, both films were incredibly divisive and needed extended cuts to help make them a little better.Suicide Squad (2016) is set after Dawn of Justice, and it assumes you know what happened in that movie. If not, it reminds you with one of the opening sequences. Apparently, after what happened in Dawn of Justice, other superbeings have begun to appear...and quickly get arrested by Amanda Waller, who is intent on using them like slave soldiers for protecting America. But like all the best laid plans, Amanda Waller's attempt to control beings beyond her control backfires, and her team is forced to clean up her mess before the Apocalypse is started.Let's talk about the good stuff in this film.Acting first. Viola Davis embodies Waller quite well as a total sociopath. I haven't seen how her character is like in the Arrowverse yet, but I'm getting there, BTW. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Harley Quinn, while Jared Leto was a great casting choice as the Joker. Will Smith's performance evokes memories of his early action films, mainly Bad Boys and Independence Day. I also liked the actors who played Katana, Killer Croc, and Captain Boomerang.The soundtrack is great, too. I am totally clueless about Rap/Hip-Hop, but there's some a lot of good pieces used in the film. Plus, using Rick James' 'Super Freak' was a great choice for Harley Quinn's introduction song.The Action Scenes are great, as well. I think it's they were very fluid and were enjoyable, but not incredibly memorable. In comparison to the fight and action scenes of the Dark Knight trilogy, Watchmen, and the first two official DC Extended Universe films, there's nothing really impressive, especially in comparison to the final fight between Superman and Zod.Also, I liked how they brought some backstory and motivation to the main villain (Enchantress). Nothing fancy, but it felt like more than what Marvel would normally do for their villains in Phase One and Two of their cinematic universe.Visually, the looks of the characters is cool. It's more realistic than the designs of the previous DC heroes, and evokes images of the Dark Knight trilogy and the first two Arrow seasons. There's no supersuits and incredibly elaborate costumes, which is appropriate, since the characters are definitely not superheroes. The only design I didn't like was the look of Enchantress, which is supposed to be like a parallel to Galadriel's dark form from Peter Jackson's movies about Middle-Earth, as she looks very different in the comics I have read about her.Now what I didn't like about the film.I didn't like that, for most of the first two acts of the movie, the characters were so detestable. It definitely rubs in your face that the characters are bad guys and they have some pretty bad traits. Then, at the third act, they unite and fight the Enchantress and the Incubus. I'm all for suspending belief, but even I was having trouble with why these guys would want to save the world.Also, I would have loved a lot more of Jared Leto's footage as the Joker. He seems like he is the best choice for the role and he really enjoys playing him. I sincerely hope he makes a cameo or something even bigger in the upcoming Birds of Prey movie in 2020 as well as The Suicide Squad in 2021. I'd say he's better than Nicholson's Joker and way more enjoyable than Ledger's Joker (Haven't seen Joaquin Phoenix's film yet, but that's not even in the official cinematic universe, so not a lot of motivation there. Besides, reportedly he's not even the real Joker in that one, anyway, so why bother?).My final opinion is that this is an okay film. If you feel like watching it, go for the Extended Cut. It's not the best DC Film, but it's not the worst. Besides, DC made up for it with Wonder Woman in 2017 and Aquaman in 2018 (No, I haven't seen Shazam, yet, but I really want to). I think David Ayer was not the best choice for directing this film, but I think James Gunn's upcoming Suicide Squad film will be much better, even if it is supposed to be a reboot and a remake at the same time yet still move the story forward...whatever that means. Hey, it's better than the theatrical cut of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, anyway.",Suicide Squad
570,Bryan_Roderick,The Deadshot and Harley Movie.,6,6 August 2016,"Suicide SquadFirst thing's first: I had a good time. Second: the film is a mess in terms of dialogue, screenplay, and editing. Many times I was left scratching my head thinking ""if he did this why would he do this?"" or ""why would that character even do that?"" Without spoiling there were too many moments of just bafflement as to why the characters did the things they did.The movie should be called the Deadshot and Harley Quin movie because that's what it is. Who cares about Killer Croc? Um...I do. I grew up watching Batman: The Animated Series. Captain Boomerang gets one or two short clips, Diablo gets about three. Deadshot and Harley get the rest of the entire movie. Will Smith, it must have been in his contract that he gets the most dialogue and best action scenes. You might have heard that Will Smith refused to work with Tarantino because he wanted to be the one who killed an important character at the end of Django. I'm not surprised that he got a chance to be the main character in this film.Harley Quinn: Margot Robbie, probably my favorite performance of hers, that being said she hasn't been in that good of movies. Exception: The Wolf of Wall Street. She has the perfect voice for it and do I wish they had developed her backstory a tad better, yeah. Best actor in the film.Amanda Waller, Viola Davis can have the stern mean look on her face but don't wear it throughout the film. Oh you're going to do that anyways? Okay. Her character is boring, and there's no meaningful connection to her, plus what she does with the Suicide Squad is just counter-intuitive.Jay Hernandez plays Diablo and has an interesting backstory. I don't really remember him from the animated series. He burns things, that's his power. There are moments when he's on screen where the things he does do not portray the character we've been introduced to. Slopping storytelling but overall good performance.Joker: Jared Leto plays his version of the joker. Does his impression of the joker change through the film. You betcha. Close your eyes for a moment when he talks and imagine Richard Nixon. Yeah. Then sometimes he sounds more like Heath Ledger. Never once did I get a Mark Hamill style voice. I get that he's trying to be his own but stick to a voice to be consistent. Other than that there's not much else to talk about the other characters of the suicide squad since the rest do pretty much nothing and the baddie in the film also acts stereotypical and dances through the monologue. Not in a good way either.Verdict: Is it a popcorn movie with mindless fun like Transformers. Yes. Does it do the characters justice? Some. Does it have problems. Yeah, lots. Should you still go see it? Yes.",Suicide Squad
571,smashthecontrolmachine,Funtastic good time!,10,31 October 2016,"I really enjoyed this movie. My favorite character was Jared Leto as the Joker and I wish there had been more of him in the movie. I truly loved the chemistry between him and Harley Quinn. I felt the sparks between the Joker and Harley Quinn and it seemed amazing. The film had enough twists and turns to keep me interested fully. I felt the story was more than solid and the cinematography was outstanding. I also appreciated the good character development, I enjoyed getting to the know each villain. The movie moved well throughout and was an edge of your seat great time. I am excited to see the next movie and where it goes. I like what I have seen so far for sure.",Suicide Squad

I was pretty impressed with the action. The characters were interesting, but the Joker actor was awful. He looked like a pimp without a feathered hat, his face looked like Marilyn Manson, and had a stupid laugh. This movie did well for its PG-13 audience, but would do better with an R rated audience. The characters stories lacked a bit. Overall, an okay film.",Suicide Squad
573,ahmad_nadal,Not That Bad,6,19 December 2016,"My luck is that I watched the movie without high expectations not as most of people did, and it wasn't really that bad as everyone saying.But I have to say that David Ayer failed to make a great film, he didn't even do anything unique or special ,not a single thing, and all the mistakes in the film are one his behave as he is the director and also the writer of the screenplay (alone).I also watched the Blur-ray extended version not the cinema's version, and I didn't find montage mistakes as I heard so I think they were managed in the Blu-ray version.the film begins with bad introduction to the team members except for Deadshot and Harley Quinn there introductions were so good for me.The presence of Batman in the movie was tremendous and was managed really good.Jared Leto's Joker wasn't definitely better than Heath Ledger's but I still loved it, it's The Joker and he is Jared Leto after all.I have to raise my hat to will smith and Margot Robbie for there acting and taking there characters to a new level, they may be the only good thing in this film besides Batman.The villain was really really really bad, with a very bad acting and horrible effects and without a clear goal or even a reason and that's what make the whole film meaningless to certain degree.I loved Rick flag by Joel Kinnaman and didn't love Amanda Waller by Viola Davis that much.so after all it isn't that bad but it's that good either . so my rating is 6.5/10",Suicide Squad
574,lev-nemkin,A very good movie...,7,18 October 2016,"When I first saw Suicide Squad in theaters I thought it was just decent not bad not great but then I ended up re-watching it recently and actually liked it better the first time around the highlights of the movie for me were The Joker and Harley Quinn their backstory was awesome how she fell in love with him and how she jumped into that vat of acid for him this is definitely not my favorite movie of 2016 but I really do like it the 2nd time around it was better. I liked the other characters as well except for Killer Croc who I felt was just not necessary in the movie Deadshot was my 3rd favorite and Will Smith was awesome as the character I liked his backstory as well how he got caught by Batman and ended up in prison. Another minor problem I have with the movie which isn't really a big deal is the so called villain Enchantress I didn't even get what the point of her character was but to me that doesn't ruin the movie. Now I'm just going to go ahead and talk about Jared Leto as The Joker I thought he was awesome I was assured he didn't have that much screen time but he had more than I was told and he was awesome no offense to Heath Ledger may he rest in peace but I liked him better...I understand that each Joker is different each actor played him differently Jack Nicholson was more of the funny Joker,Heath Ledger was more serious and Jared Leto to me was crazy but funny I loved him I never really saw him in anything else except for American Psycho but I think he's better in this than in that. I liked the chemistry between him and Harley Quinn who was played by Margot Robbie I thought she was awesome as the character now I haven't read any of the DC comics so I don't know anything about these characters except for what I saw in this movie but to me I think it's enough to me Harley Quinn is a female version of The Joker I liked how they introduced her how she was a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum,how she fell in love with The Joker and started helping him just doing anything for him. I liked their makeup as well and felt sorry for Harley when The Joker died...or did he? I'm not going to spoil the ending for those of you who haven't seen it to me this was a very good movie I did have fun with it a lot of good action as well I'd recommend it for sure if you love superhero movies except in this one it was kind of strange to see the bad guys be the heroes but at the same time a good change of pace.",Suicide Squad
575,templar77099,Silly and Choppy,6,11 August 2016,"Let me just start by saying that ""Suicide Squad"" was, among Batman V Superman one of the films I wanted to watch the most this year. And now that I've watched it, I can tell you that while financially it might turn out a bigger hit than what we previously thought, it isn't the hit that the DCEU needed to clear all doubts and ghosts after Dawn of Justice. I can't hide it, I'm a big DC fan, Batman is my favourite comic-book hero and I grew up watching Nolan's Trilogy. Maybe Nolan set a very high-bar on other comic book films to follow and when I go to the theater to watch anything DC-related, I wanna come out surprised and happy. With Suicide Squad, although that happened to some extent, I was much more prone to wonder on how much did the so call suits interfere with the process of making this one, because, although David Ayer has repeatedly stated that this is HIS cut (the contrary would definitely cause some turmoil), I believe he had a somewhat different vision for this months ago.Let me just say that contrary to what I've listened and read from some reviewers, the first half hour of the film was very painful to watch for me. The way the presented each member of the squad (not each because they inexplicably forgot Spliknot - even if he's appearance in all of this is very brief) seemed so wrong and out-of-place. Ayer's first idea, at least from what I gather was not to have the flashy flashbacks, opting for a linear presentation instead. I don't know why this was removed, but I think this way it would've been much better. The poor editing didn't help it at all and I often found myself wondering why they'd make it this way, which was, at least for me, childish sometimes.After that point I honestly enjoyed the film, and I realised I was doing so on the first big action scene, when the Squad fights the faceless hordes of ""zombies"" spawned by Enchantress and her brother. Deadshot climbing on top of a car and clearing out the street was simply amazing.Major thumbs up for the casting department. I don't know how Tom Hardy would turn out as Rick Flagg but let me say that Joel Kinnaman fits the role very well. Nothing to say about Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Viola Davis and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje cause the really seemed like they were born to play their role.The two major biggies I had with this:--- The Villain --- Cara Delevingne is a fine actress for me, but Enchantress is blend and clichéd as the villain. Lack of motivation, no character development, just the same old game we've been seeing for the past decade. Its the convention, and since this movie revolves around the Worst Heroes Ever, one would thought they'd find a more developed and well built villain to pose a threat.--- The Joker ---I've seen many criticizing Leto, I've seen many worshiping him but right now, I can't quite make my mind about his performance. He has already stated that many scenes of his character were cut, scenes that had even been incorporated on the trailers (suits meddling?) and I guess I'll have to wait for is next on-screen presence to decide.You're not going to watch this for the plot , you're going to watch this for the spectacle. That's why you're buying the ticket.Enjoy",Suicide Squad
576,Ben_Cap,The Minimum Acceptable for a Watchable Comic Book Movie,5,7 August 2016,"From the start Suicide Squad has felt like the DC answer for some of the recent Marvel movies with at best questionable ""heroes"". The easy review for this movie is to call it a poor excuse for a rip off from Guardians of the Galaxy, but it's really not fair to compare the two. Not because they are actually different, but because Guardians is in an entirely different class from Suicide Squad. There are some things in this movie that can give viewers for the future of the DC cinematic universe, but this is not the movie that will truly bring the word ""cinematic"" to the cinematic universe.The real reason that this movie is even passable is the strong work of the actors, like all of them. There are some huge character problems in Suicide Squad which i will get more into later, but really none of this is the fault of the actors. Will Smith and Margot Robbie really stand out, as they should being the real star power here. Smith brings a level of humanity to the worlds most dangerous assassin and not only that but makes the character likable, possibly the only legitimately likable character in the movie. Robbie is not just here ""for the plot"", she is truly mesmerizing on screen. Even with a character that struggles from being basically a female version of a character that is just awful, Harley is certainly a bright spot even though the she is toned down compared to the traditional take.The plot is fairly dull for the most part, they do make a good effort to realistically explain how a team of super villains fighting for the good guys, but I still constantly found myself wondering why they would not just call Batman or the Flash and avoid a lot of trouble. The movie uses the excuse that if the plans fail, the villains can be blamed, but with the well being of the entire planet at stake I think its time to stop saving skin and call in the professionals.The biggest flaw of the movie is that it was advertised as a full cast of villains and even some of your favorite heroes, which is partially true, but in the least inspired way. There are basically 5 characters in this movie that get prime spotlight, out of those 2 of them are absolutely terrible misrepresentations of classic characters. If you are a Killer Croc, El Diablo, Enchantress, Slipknot, Captain Boomerang or Katana fan be prepared to feel pushed to the side. The few times that they actually try to flesh out these characters it feels so canned and genuine. Amanda Waller is an interesting character, but honestly in a Suicide Squad movie I have no patience for bureaucrats. Rick Flagg is stunningly dull and brings nothing really to the table other than to push the story forward.I'm going to give the Joker his own paragraph, because so many things went wrong here. For starters this is not entirely Jared Leto's fault, my only hard complaint with him was that his performance was far too close to Heath Ledgers. From the cadence of his speech to even some of his mannerisms, Leto fails to separate himself from a all time great performance. Other than that the character is fundamentally flawed. This Joker is covered head to toe in gold and tattoos, which I would not have a huge problem with except they were so concerned with showing him off on the outside they forgot to make him an interesting villain. He is constantly playing out of character, from hanging out at night clubs in a sort of drug induced state for apparently no reason to be there at all to crying when he finds Harley has been arrested. Any self respecting portrayal of the Joker would not have him weep over her being taken. The Joker is an established character, and while there is always room for him to be tweaked a bit, but this is not the Joker, at least the one who wants to watch the world burn, he seems much more concerned with the color of his suit jacket.(BTW when it comes to the Joker the answer is purple, always purple, not white, not gold, purple.) For all of its shortcomings Suicide Squad is actually paced pretty well. Things move slowly at times but these were mostly character moments that for the most part were welcomed. Suicide Squad gave me flashbacks to Batman Vs. Superman in two frustrating ways. Surprisingly the action sequences were incredibly average, and not surprisingly the editing is terrible. For some reason the last 2 DC movies have been way behind the times when it comes to action sequences. Characters stand around and watch a fight, no one works in unison with each other. The editing of this movie in my opinion is the dark mark. Not only is it ridiculously sloppy, but severely disjointing at times. I may be a bit of a stickler for these sorts of things but when you are so far behind your competitor these things add up.Suicide Squad could have been a really good movie. I know there were problems in development but I honestly think it was doomed from the start. This movie held the possible weight of an entire mega franchise on it's shoulders, and it is just not set up to be that movie. Given less pressure to make a blockbuster I think that we would have gotten a much better Suicide Squad movie.",Suicide Squad

Much like John Belushi in Animal House, or Sean Penn in Fast Times at Ridgemont High he steals enough scenes to remain necessary.

579,Icedooitle,A Bull's-Eye of Horrible Execution,4,16 April 2017,"Admit it, you want to like this movie. Even if you never heard of Suicide Squad prior to the trailer's unveiling at Comic-Con, it just looked like a winner. Then came the reviews last week Headlines have denigrated Suicide Squad for all manner of politicized reasons. It has been labeled as misogynist, racist, and morally vapid. I simply do not agree. You do not need to stand on a soapbox of social superiority to call attention to how this film failed in political correctness; it is much easier to blatantly call it out for being an incoherent mess of atrociously executed plot lines and editing. I have to call attention to the editing, because I like to think there may very well be a better movie left on the cutting room floor. This is little consolation for the monumental disappointment fans are flocking to see in record numbers.The introduction is hopeful. Director and writer David Ayer wastes no time in getting us into the miserable and eccentric prison lives of the beloved Gotham villains. Will Smith as the world's greatest assassin, Deadshot; Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as the mutant crocodile-human hybrid, Killer Croc; Jay Hernandez as the repressed pyro-kinetic, Diablo; Jai Courtney as the slovenly Australian thief, Boomerang; and of course Margot Robbie as Joker's right hand wild card, Harley Quinn. More than looking the part, this cast admirably puts their backs and hearts into these characters. This is almost tragic considering so many other elements of the movie failed to do them justice. Viola Davis plays the government spook who masterminds the ""Suicide Squad Initiative"", a worst-case-scenario operation that involves taking the nation's most dangerous prisoners and thinly offering them clemency in exchange for defending the home team. So, what atrocity leads to the gang being organized? Enchantress, an ancient witch inhabiting a doctor's body, breaks free from the government's leverage and wreaks unholy havoc on a global level. The issue with this, Enchantress is initially a member of the Suicide Squad. The rest of the team is organized for the first time to battle one of their own members who went rogue. And I kid you not, this paradox is never addressed. The loose debates about letting these mass murderers walk the streets pivots on an assurance of control. Once the control is lost with one member, the rest are allowed out of their cages to get it back. Our love for the characters is stretched so far that we are expected to turn a blind eye to gaping plot holes and lazy justifications. The story ostensibly fast forwards through necessary expositions and tangents to get to the next battle or witty exchange between squad members.For all its faults, there are short stretches of entertainment when you feel the joy Jared Leto and Margot Robbie bring to their roles. Flashbacks to Leto's Joker with Robbie will make you lament that they didn't just ride that tangent instead of letting this story go so astray. Will Smith has moments of embodying Deadshot in very satisfying ways. He can strike a pose in the heat of battle that summons more fond memories of the comic character. The actors have a reverence for the material that is unfortunately not shared by everyone on the project. Because Suicide Squad can officially be called a blockbuster despite critical backlash, it's a lock for a sequel. When that project comes to fruition, you may still want to like it, but you at least may not expect to.",Suicide Squad
580,modernmonstersdotnet,Stupid Squash,2,23 September 2016,"Another example of a movie delivering the exact opposite that what its hype and teasers promised, Suicide Squad is the big 2016 summer letdown, a tent pole crashing under its own weight and an absolute bore. It's like watching a train wreck, only it's a toy train carrying action figures instead of characters, like watching the paint dry only it's pale beige, like watching an hourglass measuring the sad fashion you have elected to waste away two hours of your life. Two hours later you will have gained absolutely nothing and you will wish for ten minutes of quality time with the makers of this beached whale, carrying Harley Quinn's baseball bat. But you won't get them.This thing gives the term ""mindless entertainment"" a whole new meaning, considering it's neither one nor the other. It's far from mindless, as you can hear throughout the wheels of a declining industry churning to please an audience already saturated by superheroes antics (genius idea: bring in Will Smith!), and not entertaining in the slightest because should have they conceive a torture device for Guantanamo, it would look, sound and feel more or less exactly like this one, in a loop.What does it say about Hollywood when a movie high concept, ""bunch of villains sent against an even worst foe"" is treated so cowardly that the result plays like the loosely connected cinematic sequences of a PC game? With most of its avatars on pause, most of them provided with the bare schematics of a character which make eunuchs and no-lifers of them all, with no antagonist to speak of but a fashion model and no threat whatsoever to their little, desperate, insectile life, you bet you understand what it says: here's you garbage flick of the week, morons; see it in the theater because downloading is evil.Viola Davies, unable to be bad even she tried real hard (what she does here with her mouth full) carries around a thick top secret portfolio of coloured-by-numbers villains her dream is to assemble in an anti Justice League, because she didn't have the opportunity to come up with the Justice League idea in the first place. Fortunately for her, a scientist from the Tara Reid school of Like, Serious Archeology mistakes an ancient clay bottle for a can of pop and frees The Enchantress, a goth chick with severe hygiene issues whose brother trapped in the next bottle have like, a mean God complex. Together they wanna build a McGuffin to rule the world and enslave the human race, so it's time to kick them in the butt real good. Superman is gone, Batman is having a sabbatical, so the next best thing is to flank Willsmith with a quartet of mildly deranged goons, controlled by an explosive device implanted in oh whatever.Willsmith was arrested (not branded, natch) by Batman, as was the case for Margotrobbie, so movie can enter the Batman canon as a ""Whatever happened to them?"" memorial programme. Willsmith is on board with the dual objective to long for his adorable daughter (fortunately not played by his own) and utter the title at some point. Yes, they also did that. Even Batman v. Superman didn't have Bruce Wayne say ""I'll be damned, is this the dawn of justice?"", right? Right? He's also a sniper who can't miss. Nobody does is better, makes me feel sad for the rest. And they are quite a sad bunch.So, from memory: a mutant Cindy Lauper who only wanna have fun, a pyrokinetic latino, a crocodile man providing infra-bass, an Aussie with a boomerang (too bad he didn't bring a didgeridoo), a Japanese with a katana (same remark about a koto) team up with Willsmith in order to defeat the Enchantress' budding reign of terror, under the mild maintenance of a war veteran called Flag. Yep, how's that for super heroism? Oh, and there is also this guy who almost misses the chopper, crosses the screen and dies. Really scrapping the bottom of the barrel with this one, Viola. One wonders how many such losers were in your thick portfolio of Evil.Anyway, helicopters are repeatedly taken down, not unlike frappucinos are gulped at your nearest Starbuck's, the super ordinary dreams of super heroes are revealed by the Enchantress, whose heart is not in it (there, see what just one did? Lol). She nevertheless has the best scene when she accomplishes her transformation and instantly revert to Fashion Week catwalking, Cara Delavinge's background.Is one missing something? What? The Joker? One doesn't know what you are talking about. The Joker is not in this movie.",Suicide Squad

582,kailomonkey,Mediocre,3,28 August 2016,"If you've seen this movie you might find ""mediocre"" a rather generous review word. When you compare the movie to what it appeared to want to be, a highly stylised anti-hero movie full of the joys of pop icons on a roller-coaster of cool, it comes out pretty mediocre.The script was not well written or delivered, the whole thing was full of holes too glaring to dismiss, the whole anti-hero thing didn't work at all because they just tried to make them heroes... Whereas if they were kick-ass villains doing their villain thing a lot more the film could have worked on the premise it set out.SPOILERS: The fact that the government woman getting attacked was the satisfying bit... Just shows how confused the good guy bad guy thing was.OK so we could have complex bad-guys who are good intentioned or driven to evil etc. But none of that was pulled off well. Harley Quinn is supposed to be crazy but in order to spit out an easy generic piece of smeg script, her and all the others have pretty normal emotional responses despite being supposed psychopaths. Harley says she's crazy but about the only crazy she actually acts out is going along with story elements because OK.The final villain fight was set up like a lame ass video-game, dread the video-game if there is one. Everything cool that could have happened was always taken away just to allow Harley the victory and make the team useful for their individual input. This really isn't the dream team, they don't have to function well together, they're villains, not working well together can be their downfall ready for when they face the justice league. Stop making this a superhero movie! It's meant to be a bad guy anarchy movie...They showed us the witch stuff straight away then insisted on a half-arsed flash back to show ""what happened"" who was that for?? We the audience had already seen it! If you want to show us the flash back to reveal some twist, keep us along for the ride; in the dark. If that would leave us confused as to what's going on and you have to show us, then just don't do a reveal montage on top of that, that reveals nothing!The whole 'I can give you what you want' thing was ridiculously executed whereby they clearly weren't being fooled they were just dreaming pretty much. If the things they were experiencing were happening in the actual location they were at they'd be sucked in, but no they were sucked in by a complete fantasy (except when deadshot sees his daughter telling him not to shoot) and only reminded by fire guy at some point.A positive point here. At least when boyfriend guy has to take the action to kill his dream of having his girlfriend back finally tied together that whole 'get what you really want' thing. That could have left us with a really sad and informative reason that these guys are bad guys never getting what they feel they need in life and being all bitter and that. But no, they had to spoil that too with a happy ending that makes Harley smile like she has normal human emotions, yet again!What else. The machine of floating garbage that never forms but can zap stuff when she's a witch who could just do that anyway. The dumb-ass bomb thing that I already scraped upon for combining different character's skills. Basic as all flying frig. The only reason for that explosion to cause everything to come back in (unless I'm missing a specific skill of this bomb) is if it killed the witch or damaged her enough to reverse her magic somehow. In which case it would be thrown at her not the clouds that is her magic machine above her.Why all the massive holes. Why all the simplified elements. Was this made for 8 year olds? Because the certificate here in England is 15. For a 15 those generic 'we can cut them up because fantasy' enemies could have been a lot more person-like. Character introduction at the beginning of the film was the simplest possible, and hung unfairly on Harley. I know she's the one we're really interested in, but don't be a dick to everyone else in public, that's just not on!All these bad plays could have been glossed over if they at least came off as constant bad-ass villains with well written and performed lines of script and fast paced iconic poses and action. But no. Mediocre. Having written vaguely about just some of the things that make this film crap, the word seems generous even to me. But no, I won't give it the satisfaction of calling it a terrible bad movie. It is what it is... Just a shame it isn't.Mediocre.",Suicide Squad

But I did want to share my opinion this time because there were such mixed reactions to the film. Yesterday this film got it's premiere in my country. And must say my expectations were quite high, to be honest after all those amazing trailers. I'm a fan of DC since CW's the Flash so I'm still kind of new to it all. But this movie is not as bad as the critics say. It is way better than Fantastic Four.Of course this film has flaws, like every film does. The editing in the film, mainly at the start wasn't very good. When the film continued it got a little better, but it could have been much better. Sometimes the story is a little bit of a chaos but not very much.. It still has a great story, and the director did a solid job of telling the story although it was a little bit of a chaos. The performances in the film was the best thing about it. Everyone did such an amazing job and were so close to there characters from the comics. Though Jared Leto isn't really my joker, he had his good moments. Personally I loved Margot Robbie's performance the most in the film. She really was so good playing Harley Quinn and I really want to see more of her in the DCEU.Overall I think this movie was very good, very enjoyable.

(even though its a film about the villains )The Flash made a cameo ... There's a main ""villain"" called the enchantress ... The joker got a bad version portrayal .... dramatic and not in a good way lol There's an intro to the 4/5 main characters each with their special powers (as narrated by VD) LOL Oh and Viola Davis is in the movie lol and finally, there's a soundtrack to go with every character lol ... My god this sounds so over convoluted lol ...thats because it is ! Its messy and weird and sloppy ..with a lot of music. Its unfocused and not at all visually attractive. Rooting for the villain is not a good concept, it blurs the lines when its time to root for the good guys.It is fun in a silly (it does not take itself too seriously kid of way) but it certainly does not deserve a sequel.

JUST HOW???Joker was a big letdown and Harley even more.I guess that's why every irrelevant person on this planet loved her and dressed like her during Halloween.....Makes sense....The good side is it had some decent visual effects and some nice explosions.Also Will Smith's acting was kinda nice but weak story line and dialogue here as well.Other than that it was a waste of time and expectations.",Suicide Squad
587,ksharath1999,An action entertainer that could have been much more.,6,4 August 2021,"Suicide Squad opens up with one of the best sequences DCEU. The case files, narrative and the flashback sequences where just great. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jay Hernandez performances are the once that impress and stands out among squad members. The movie had its own moments here are there like the acid factory scene,third act and the mid-credits. Third act with all the slo mo's and frames were enough to elevate the movie much more.Coming to cons, The plot is the main thing that weakens the movie. The whole plot missed a lot of factors making it imperfect as well as make the film feel pointless at times. Lack of proper screen presence for Joker was yet another disappointing factor. Most of the other members of the squad either felt wasted or sidelined as the film reached its end.In the end, Suicide Squad is an entertaining ride with DC's supervillains and anti-heroes.Rating:67%",Suicide Squad

Sadly, as long as these dire 'super hero' movies keep getting punters into the cinemas and making profits, the producers will keep churning them out.The effects here are actually better and more consistent than both Spiderman Homecoming and Wonderwomen, but the characters and writing is so below par, it makes for a far worse experience.Please producers, look at 'Logan' and see what it did right and why people rate it so highly.

589,Hassan_Scarborough,WB has forsaken thee,4,18 August 2016,"This is what happens when a director writes a comic book film and doesn't have a good grasp of the source material.Great performances from Margot and Leto and with that great homage to Alex Ross, it's easy to see David understood these two characters and in this film he reached to both the comic books and cartoon as references points.And contrary to popular belief, this film borrows heavily from the comic books. Unfortunately like BvS, it doesn't go all the way, or cherry picks too much.Which makes much of what the characters do make little to no sense.The characters were also too soft. They are supposed to be the worst of the worst. Double crossing everyone in site and greedy. Here they are not even close.Will Smith is yet again portraying a caricature of himself. It's as if he refuses to portray a truly vile and evil character. Viola Davis was another highlight in this films. Her character simply wasn't written well as it could have been.I personally didn't see issues with editing. The film simply drags because the pacing is very poor.The final act is deplorable. I'm not sure if Cara Delevingne is that bad an actress or if the writing/direction was that awful, that it made her performance that much more cringe worthy.I'm just glad I watched this film at a discount. I hope Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and Jared Leto return. The rest, I have no interest in seeing again and DC might want to think about replacing David Ayes as writer and director.",Suicide Squad
590,natsuka_arei,Don't watch it,5,21 December 2018,"Hmm...where do I start? So many complaint I want to write down about SS.First of all, many of my friends already warned me how horrible Suicide Squad was. Despite all the warning I still give it a try and watch it on Netflix, wondering why so many people criticize it. After all it is interesting to see a bunch of villain trying to save the world. It can't be that bad right? but I was wrong. It is that BAD. Now I know why. I wonder why this movie even able to get 6 score, I believe it is supposed to be lower than 6. I will try to write it brief, here we go.The only thing I like from this crap is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot. The rest can go down to the trash bin for all I care.What's so bad about this movie?
1.) I tell you, there's no plot. The only looks like plot here was Amanda Waller and the team trying to defeat the witch to save the world (which, the main problem itself caused by Amanda Waller. It was her idea in the first place trying to control a bunch of villains and take advantage of them. She literally threatened them and so the witch tried to free herself from her)2.) Amanda Waller. I really hate her throughout the movie and really happy when the villain got her. She deserved it. She was cold hearted, cruel (masking it with twisted sense of justice), and her mouth was nasty. She even killed her own subordinates and in the late movies, only care about her safety. C'mon guys, She was really awful. I really hate every scenes when she was in.3.) Jared Leto as Joker. To be honest, one of my main reason to see SS was because I saw Joker in the trailer. YET, I am so disappointed. He really didn't have any importance in this movie only served as Harley past. He only appeared randomly several times. Really, cut all of his scene and it won't really matter for the rest of the story. He was weird, not convincing enough, and totally failed to play Joker, a supposed to be insane, genius, twisted criminal. Totally the opposite of Heath Ledger (he was brilliant!)4.) Trying to be like Avengers or Guardian of the Galaxy and failed to be both. To many characters in this movie and they did weak story telling about each character or on how they were connected. So, you will find yourself hard to sympathize or connected with any of them. The character's development was poor so you can't really like them.5.) Didn't make sense. Amanda got the heart of the witch to threaten her, in order to freely control her. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HER WEAKNESS because she will die if something happen to her heart. The witch then, trying to go against Amanda so Amanda stab her heart so MANY TIMES to get rid of her. YET, the witch survived. It looks like what Amanda did, didn't affect the witch so much. So stupid. If it doesn't matter at all, why the hell the witch was so afraid about Amanda taking her heart in the first place. She didn't die after those multiple stab on her heart. Stupid. Really.If you want to watch some anti-hero, just go watch Deadpool. It is a good one.",Suicide Squad
591,nathannicolarobertscouk,Saved from being terrible by Margot Robbie (and Davis and Smith),4,26 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is the best DC of the year, but that says more about its stablemate than the film itself. In the same breath, its the worst film of the summer since the other film. Perhaps Suicide Squad is even more of a disappointment because of the wonders worked by the marketing team, crafting an incredible campaign that duped audiences into thinking DC had pulled it out of the bag with this one. That is a testament to them I suppose and they do deserve all the profits from this one for doing so but the saying goes that even a broken clock is right twice a day. Too many cooks (elements) spoil the broth (film) and I truly kick myself for believing they could win audiences around with this one. Still, even by the smallest sentiment, Suicide Squad is somewhat of a progression, so at least they're moving upwards...SUMMARY: Suicide Squad is saved from being terrible by Margot Robbie's sensational performance of Harley Quinn, and promising work from Viola Davis and Will Smith.REVIEW: http://bit.ly/2bEc07L",Suicide Squad
592,charbelelaro,Completely bland and did not entertain me in the slightest,2,2 April 2019,"Suicide Squad supposedly directed by David Ayer, is a film that experienced a large amount of issues with its production. From studios getting involved to the director almost leaving, I'm surprised this movie had slight coherence. To say the least after watching this movie I was angry. This movie is the definition of false advertising as multiple scenes in the trailer did not appear in the film. Mainly the joker who had little to no screen time. Everything from the action sequences to the characters were completely bland and did not entertain me in the slightest. And Cara Delevingne as the villain... why. There were two decent things about this film being Margot Robbie and Will Smith who gave convincing performances, so therefore I give DC's Suicide Squad a 2. This film was incredibly hyped for such a long period of time with so much marketing. Focus on the actual film next time DC.",Suicide Squad
593,Gorillaboi,"Severely Disappointing - poor structure, story and editing",4,5 August 2016,"Before starting, let it be clear that I'm more of a DC fan (than Marvel). I root for their movies, as I've always preferred their darker, more serious tone and better villains. I had/have very high hopes for their new fleet of titles. But whilst I loved Batman vs Superman, this movie -- Suicide Squad -- is absolutely terrible. Considering its hype, it's one of the worst comic book films ever made.So, why was it bad? I'll break it down.....POOR STRUCTURE/STORY: To be honest, I don't think there even was a structure to this movie. After a rushed introduction to each of the characters, a bunch of stuff just happens for them to fight. The story is non-existent. There's no central character to follow, or even a decent villain to understand/appreciate their motives. It's quite clear they changed/re-edited the film AFTER they made it. Everything is so choppy and poorly edited, that you can't help but feel large chunks of it have been left out. Undoubtedly, this is not the movie that they started with.FORGETTABLE ACTION: Okay, so the plot isn't very good. But as a comic book film, the action can salvage this, right? Wrong. It's not that the action is bad. It's just that there's nothing memorable about it. Batman vs Superman had the amazing first battle (followed up by the amazing Martha Kent rescue ). And Civil War had the incredible airport fight. But Suicide Squad has NOTHING. It tries very hard to create one meaningful/impactful sequence with Deadshot, but it is soooo underwhelming that you begin to feel sorry for them.JOKER: If you have high hopes for the amazing Jared Leto and the iconic Joker character that's contributed to most of the movie's hype, then prepare for an epic let-down. Firstly, he barely even features throughout the two hours. And secondly, his introduction and the few scenes involving him are rushed and pointless. He has no relevance to the main plot. There was no real insight into him, no progression, and quite frankly, you quickly lose any interest in him because his role is so meaningless. It's remarkable how badly they got this wrong!UNINTERESTING CHARACTERS: Harley Quinn quickly grows tiresome with her ditsy/crazy demeanour. If you've caught all of the trailers and promotional material beforehand, then you've already seen her best bits. The croc dude is pointless and just growls. The fire guy has a sympathetic backstory but offers very little. Jai Courtney is quite funny as the Australian bloke. And although I was cynical going in, Will Smith as Deadshot was surprisingly good (so props for that).There are many other things wrong which, at this moment, I don't have the energy to put down. And as a viewer it's becoming increasingly frustrating to not get a good stand-alone comic book movie anymore. The producers are so franchise-focused that they concentrate more on setting up future instalments instead of the current movie they're working on.",Suicide Squad
594,shadowyx12,"""Suicide Squad"" is fun but will probably leave you with a headache",5,28 August 2016,"Following the devastating events in ""Batman V. Superman"", top government agent Amanda Waller presents the idea to form 'Task Force X' - a combat team composed of the most dangerous villains within the United States' prison system. The squad's main goal will be to counter otherworldly threats that would otherwise be too difficult for the military to handle. In exchange for successfully completing their missions, members receive a ten-year reduction off their sentences. After a new, supernatural terror arises, the team is forced to band together and work under the supervision of Colonel Rick Flag and his squad.The greatest strength of ""Suicide Squad"" is its cast. Margot Robbie shows her true acting chops as the delightfully devilish Harley Quinn; her performance of that iconic character is reminiscent to how she's portrayed in the ""Batman: The Animated Series"". She perfectly captures her unpredictable, goofy nature as well as her emotional/romantic side (there is one scene that particularly highlights this aspect). Her chemistry with the rest of the cast is palpable but especially strong with Will Smith's character, Deadshot. Will Smith rocks it as Deadshot, being both a hardened, no-nonsense assassin and an all-around good guy with a concept of honor and respect. Unfortunately, Smith seems too comfortable in this role and, as a result fails to completely merge with his character. Most of the time he's on-screen, I don't feel like I'm seeing Deadshot, but just Will Smith being himself in an awesome-looking costume.The rest of the cast doesn't compare to these two, but they still made an impression on me. Jared Leto proves he is worthy of playing the clown prince of crime; Jai Courtney is surprisingly absorbed into the role of Captain Boomerang (I didn't even recognize him); even Joel Kinnaman manages to bring some levity to the movie despite playing the hardened Colonel Flag (but his performance is bone dry). Viola Davis ties this stellar cast with a cold and menacing performance as Amanda Waller. Ayer does his best to salvage what he can from a script that probably received a million notes from Warner execs; the strongest aspect of his direction (for this movie) lies in his ability to create chemistry between the characters. However, aside from that, David Ayer has directed far better films in the past.The script lies on the other end of the spectrum – it is riddled with plot holes, contrivances, sentimentality, and predictable moments. On the other hand, it suffers from a lack of meaningful moments, character development, and, of course, the Joker. The villain in this movie (Enchantress) is forgettable and is only evil because the story requires her to be. However, despite these story sins, I still had a fun time watching ""Suicide Squad"". All I had to do was turn off my brain and remind myself that I was about to watch a popcorn flick that had no intention of taking anything seriously.Another thing about this movie that could easily irk people is its musical selection. Almost every major song that pops up in a ""Suicide Squad"" trailers also appears in the movie itself. Most of the songs are poorly utilized, but there are scenes that work really well with the musical selections (e.g. during each character's introduction). ""Suicide Squad"" works well if you're a casual fan of DC's comic books. The cast is fantastic, the script could have been far better, and everything else – the VFX, the editing, the cinematography, etc. – is mostly hit and miss. I had a fun time watching ""Suicide Squad"" but will probably skip it should I run into it again.",Suicide Squad
595,chaitov,"I Cant See The Action on Screen,Too Dark.",1,8 August 2016,"OK.So I'm a senior.But I've seen lots of Marvel/DC Comics movies. I really liked Ant Man last year because there was a story to it.Suicide Squad was filmed in my home town, Toronto.There was so much hype.But even my grown son hated it when we saw it.There's no character development. We wasted our money.Don't go to this disaster. You'll regret it no matter your age.During each scene, I was wondering what is happening.Because the lighting was so dark,I couldn't make out the action. There were times I kept asking myself why I had agreed to come to this film. The character,Harley Quinn, had this Brooklyn accent which didn't really fit in. The joker was a joke,not even scary or comical.This was the worst movie I have seen this year.",Suicide Squad
596,chi-cerca-trova,Studio meddling and weak script undermine potentially great movie,4,15 August 2016,"Overall: Suicide Squad opens in a ham fisted and slow manner, which immediately puts the pacing on its back foot. By the time action starts to pick up about half way through, the poorly written and clichéd characters have not given me any reason to be invested in the story and thus not really have any care for the action. It's a shame, because this was a great opportunity for DC to step out from behind Marvel with something unique that had a great pedigree of comic history and talent involved. Instead, this is a mess of uninteresting story lines coupled with a collection of half-baked characters that result in a boring film. 4/10Detailed Breakdown:Story: The biggest issue with this story is that it lacks a cohesive perspective; Deadshot and Harley Quinn are given minimal backstory, with Deadshot being the only one that is given an emotional grounding. That leaves the audience without an anchor point for their involvement in the story, which when coupled with blaise visuals and hackneyed writing, gives the story no characters for us to really care about. Without characters to care about, the story is scattershot and weak, underlining this lack of perspective and robbing the film of any momentum. -3Characters: Overall, the characters do a seemingly alright job at building chemistry and gelling as a team. The real big problem is that this one movie has too much to do, so it tries to force us to feel something for them rather than letting it occur naturally. Will Smith plays Deadshot well, effectively portraying a preternatural assassin and is easily the strongest performance in the movie. However, Jared Leto and Margot Robie's Joker and Harley Quinn are both poorly thought out and weakly portrayed. Jared Leto is not in the film nearly as much as you are led to think, but the time he is in the movie is both annoying and distracting; you never felt any real menace from his performance, no maniacal energy that is a perfect and complete foil for Batman. He feels like every ""crazed gangster"" character that we've seen in crime movies the last 15 years. But, the real tragedy here is Harley Quinn, which was either written or edited terribly. When she is working with the team, she is constantly reaching for one-liners that are obvious and poorly written and her history doesn't make sense or have any impact on the story. Overall, the characters in this movie are generally one-dimensional and the performances pretty much reflect that. -3Production Design: Pretty bland overall. Costumes are well put together, with Deadshot's costume really standing out as each part of his costume having actual functions. Harley Quinn's gun was also well designed, bringing a certain anarchic grace to the pistol. Other than that, the design was not anything special. 0Music: This soundtrack was distracting and forced. The problem here is not so much the pop score rather the soundtrack is used in lieu of character development, which ultimately comes off as heavy handed. Furthermore, when using a pop soundtrack, there should be a connecting theme beyond the fact its ""movie music"". There is no connecting theme than trying to hit over the head repeatedly with how cool it's trying to be, which only glaringly points out how it's trying to cover over weak editing and storytelling. -4Misc: With the prevalence of films being adapted from deep mythologies with years of backstory and lore to draw from, it's easy to fall into the trap of ""well, it explains it in the book/comic/etc."". A movie needs to tell it's story, completely, within its running time. If the viewer isn't given an emotional anchor because of how the story is told, then the movie failed. Harley Quinn and The Joker have an incredibly rich and deep relationship that spans years of comics and movies. None of that complexity made it to the final film.Movies like this will continue to fail if they rely on external media to do the heavy story telling lifting. While films can, and should, draw inspiration from a myriad of sources, these sources should not be used as shortcuts from what the job of writers and directors: to tell a story.",Suicide Squad
597,nizzambaharuddin,Bad movie with a lot left to be desired,2,11 December 2019,"All right, I forgot I haven't gave this movie a review. Here we go:Let's talk about what I hate first: I hate that they doesn't even remotely show the Joker-Harley Quinn relationship right. Now everyone thought that Joker is just this crazy romantic practical guy (saves his girlfriend in a SWAT suit that spells JOKER, mind you). Now every girl is posting a picture of Harley and Joker with the words ""relationship goals"". Yep, that's pretty annoying.Character adaptation: Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang and El Diablo are definitely my favorite. Margot Robbie is the cinematic definitive Harley Quinn now. Meanwhile, El Diablo is a very sympathetic character. Although, I would have loved to see more of Captain Boomerang in the Flash solo movie. Almost all the characters are portrayed well. Deadshot, Amanda Waller (except for Joker). I'm still reserving my judgment on Jared Leto's Joker. But from what this movie have shown, I'm not in the positive zone. He's too much of a mafia for my liking, what with the ring-kissing and all. Almost to the point that I hope Ben Affleck would never use Joker again in his Batman movies (although a Red Hood based movie might tip my preference).Story: I thought they missed a very HUGE opportunity to show the ""who are the real bad guys?"" kinda thing when they first encounter the Enchantress' slaves. They should have make the soldier throw a bomb when Killer Croc is still fighting and killed Killer Croc. Then Deadshot would confront the soldier who threw the bomb and he could say ""But you guys are expendables. We all are. I wouldn't hold a grudge if my teammates threw a bomb while I was fighting. It's what makes me a soldier, and you ONLY a mercenary who cares about money and his own life"". That would make a very interesting clash of ideas and perspectives. They only did that with Waller.Villain: Meh, is all I can say. Very Marvel-esque villain. All show and no substance. No good motivation on why she wanna create a ""machine god"". Very powerful (too poweful) but easily defeated. Imagine any other strong character defeated that way (Darkseid for instance) It should be a dramatic climax, like El Diablo sacrificing himslef to kill the Enchantress rather than her brother. Definitely reminds me of Starlord final dance-off with what-his-name. (Oh Ronan, I forgot)Other than that, they're okay. A very Marvel-esque movie, for a DC movie. A bit disappointed, especially after the heavy themes of BvS. Don't get me wrong. Not saying it needs to be dark or anything. Just thought that while the idea is good, the execution isn't. A bad movie. But very memorable. Just a bit much like a Marvel movie to my liking. And since I'm never a fan of Marvel movies formula, a film that failed to cross the finish line for me.",Suicide Squad
598,Shad_Critic,A flawed but fun movie,6,27 August 2016,"I had high expectations before seeing Suicide Squad. When I watched the real thing, it kinda falls down. First of all, the movie was cool looking. It had interesting characters, good action and not so bad acting. Will Smith and Margot Robbie did great playing their respective characters. It made me want to see more. With the down side, not all of the characters were given attention. Even though I pretty much know who Killer Croc, Katana, Captain Boomerang, Rick Flagg and Enchantress are, those characters lack the backstory they needed. Also, Jared Leto's Joker; I didn't love it nor hate it, I just think it's a lot less interesting unlike the previous Jokers like Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. In conclusion, Suicide Squad is a fun movie to watch, it may have its flaws but still, it's fun.",Suicide Squad

Margot Robbie is amazing as harley Quinn and deserves an oscar for it, simply a brilliant performance.
Jared Leto as the Joker.... I do understand, why people compare it to the flawless Heath Ledger performance as the Joker but in this, movie Jared Leto's Joker works really well
Really you can't compare it because in this movie heath ledgers joker wouldn't have worked.

600,fjk1138-731-161881,"Complete Letdown, even when I expected nothing",2,31 December 2016,"Considering I had low expectations going into this, I can honestly say I was completely surprised by just how lousy of a film turned out to be.The script was the lamest I've seen in ages (A 12 year old could do better). The pointless ""assemble the group to fight the bad person"" plot has been done countless times (Avengers, anyone?) There was weak chemistry between the characters and I didn't like any of them. Jared Leto's Joker is a weak imitation of all the previous actors/voice actors, at best (maybe that's why he was barely in the movie?). Will Smith acted like....Will Smith. Margot Robie's lines were stupid and didn't fit her as well as her short shorts did. Viola Davis' time was completely wasted in this movie, especially now considering the countless awards she has won. And the fact that they have to explain/introduce the characters by name on screen only proves that most of the characters are known only to the die hard comic book geeks and/or are hardly worth presenting in the first place. Many of them barely have any lines.The soundtrack over uses popular songs and all felt out of place and unnecessary. Are you selling a soundtrack or showing a film? And as much as I love ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" it doesn't belong in the DC universe. The rest of the score was better, but had no distinct or memorable themes.There were too many scenes at night or otherwise in the dark that were all poorly lit, and too much CGI as usual. The final ""boss"" was boring and nothing you haven't seen before.I saw it on pay per view, but I wouldn't even recommend this if you get it for free on cable a few months from now. The movie was lame enough that I don't even care about a sequel.

That was just awful.It started off good introducing all of these great and promising anti-hero characters that DC really nails in the book (Literally in the comics and The Dark Knight. FAR more preferable to start with if you want to invest in the DC universe), and then it goes downhill. There was no meaning in this movie at all. We get all of these cool moments, but where is the story? It became nothing in the end.I gotta say, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, and Will Smith all carried this movie on their backs. I say that in the best way possible. But dear lord. As much as I like the guy, NEVER put Jared Leto's Joker back in the DC universe. EVER! This movie, in a way, shafted his career into a low. And for an Oscar winner, he was just really disappointing in this film. Easily the worst Joker I've seen.I guess the score and costumes were fine. But jeez, Pass. Pass.

The characters are compelling and unique and seeing them begin to develop dynamics and relationships is fantastic. The movie is dark, compelling, action packed with unique characters and humor. Will Smith made Deadshot proud. Margot Robbie is a standout as Harley. Jared Leto is amazing as joker. A dark, twisted with humor and complex take on the iconic character that is realistic and harks back to the joker of comics.

605,LivBrumei,"It could be amazing, too bad it lacks story",6,30 October 2016,"Probably one of the most anticipated movies of 2016, which gives it a huge expectation and adds responsibility. Too bad the movie isn't enough to correspond to all of the publicity that it had. I'm not a huge fan of Marvel movies, but I usually see them and they end up not being disappointing. It's what happens with Suicide Squad. The characters? Amazing! Harley Quinn, The Joker and Amanda Waller are enough to captivate us to the screen. And the other characters don't make a bad job either. But what after introducing the characters and their story? What do we get? Then it practically gets the same old story. A lot of special effects, things blowing up, people and/or monsters dying and that's it. If it wasn't for a couple of lines and appearances from HQ, The Joker it could get kind of boring for me, as I don't specifically love big explosion and fight scenes. For me the second part just lacked a better (more consistent and stronger) story. I think it just supported itself too much in the characters and because there are many of them it gets harder to let them explore and do more for the movie. So more of the characters could help? Maybe, but really a better premise to see them working together would really be the key in my opinion. Overall is not as bad as some painted it, but it is certainly not as good as we expected.",Suicide Squad
606,mclong2009,"Somewhere between ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Avengers""",6,27 August 2016,"""Suicide Squad"" is another mildly entertaining film--I wasn't expecting much after I'd heard it was trying to be like ""Deadpool"". I haven't seen ""Deadpool"" yet but one film trying to be like another is never a really a healthy sign. The pacing is so similar to ""Ghostbusters"", and at some scenes the members of ""Suicide Squad"" come together like they are the next ""Avengers"", but the characters just don't have the chops for it. Will Smith's character can shoot straight, cool. Another is hot and crazy--Harley Quinn. The other is an over the top psycho--The Joker. Throw in some real life Navy seals, great CGI and some otherworldly witches, and it all adds up to a watchable film. I really enjoyed Mr. Ayers' ""The Fury"". I suppose the DC universe puts expectations on to a writer\director. You can be good, just don't be great.",Suicide Squad
607,benj-20839,"I LOVED Batman V Superman but the Critics got SUICIDE SQUAD Right, What an AWFUL Film!",1,7 August 2016,"I Actually Think The Critics Were Too Generous With This Film!!I LOVED THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY, MAN OF STEEL AND BvS. I'm not that knowledgeable about the comic book worlds for DC or Marvel, but i do love watching movies. I was looking forward to this film even with the poor critics response.What a mess, right from the start. Awful film. It was a roadrunner way of filmmaking, the structure and editing of scenes didn't give a chance to connect with the films story or characters. It was like a unentertaining mtv music video. For a film with such a frenetic style of storytelling it was boring, i was counting the minutes, the end didn't come soon enough.The dialog was embarrassing at times.The few shoot'em up action scenes were unremarkable and unmemorable. The finale was a joke of unbelievability, even for a superhero film, a cgi heavy ending that was like a damp squib to an already unexciting movie. Like a really rubbish supernaturals vs humans confrontation.I love Jared Leto but The Joker's scenes weren't created right or edited to show the pure evil he is. His scenes were so random and nearly irrelevant it was a shame to watch. Leto's talents were wasted and utilized incorrectly in this film, not like in Batman and Dark Knight, where they savoured his menace in each scene and built on it. This just looks like rapid fire weird faces. And they should have chosen a different look for the Joker too, to be honest i liked it before i actually saw it in the movie.Viola Davies character was not convincing at all as a goody-baddie.As soon as the gang get to Midway City it turns into the Will Smith show. They may as well have called the film 'The Smith Squad.' All these so called ultimate baddies who follow no one but themselves, who defy law, order and hierarchy and anyone else tbh turn into a bunch of little sheep. The film makes him out to be the leader of them. And he's the least nutso guy! When have these kind of ultimate baddies/mentally deranged characters ever followed an average bad guy! I'm not a fan of Will Smith so maybe it stood out more to me but still it made no sense. He did most of the talking throughout, besides Harley Quinn and Boomerang who mainly had a bunch of one-liners. He was the voice of reason here!Boomerang was my favourite character, he seemed the most interesting and was cool enough to expect a solo movie from, not that DC would.I'd like to see Jared Leto's Joker in another film also, with more of a storyline. Besides those two though, i wouldn't care if any of the others in this appeared in any future DC films again. Only because they weren't presented well in this.I hope there isn't another Suicide Squad film only because i'd rather see a different DC comic movie get a chance.Fantastic Four was more entertaining and well made than this for me.And the use of hit songs just felt forced. Not like say Guardians Of The Galaxy where the hit songs were few but important and elevated the scene and film.1/10",Suicide Squad
608,tommyboy-16,Not what I expected,5,28 May 2017,"This was one of the biggest entertainment wet sandwiches of recent times for me. The highlights... Harley Quinn...she played her role very well. Crazy, sexy, flirty. I would have liked a few more comments about the Joker. I wanted some of the traditional talk, traditional names she has for the Joker. But overly, I thought this portrayal was good. Joker...I think I liked him. The trailers and the talk made it sound like this was going to be a new spin on a famous recipe, but this joker was just parsley on my plate. I cant even say I want more. I never really got a taste..however, what I did see did look like a new recipe. I guess I must have got my order wrong.Thats it...all the highlightsThe film was afraid to live on the characters. Instead it tried to live off of WIll SMITH. It was Will being Will and that was our highlight and it sucked. I am surprised they didn't have Will getting Harley. If I wanted to see an unbelievable movie about Will Smith where he gets to be witty, I have a pile of them. To me this movie is about the characters and not a popular actor. I cant remember much more than I have typed. The main reason I remember Will is because it was that bad. Like a hair in your soup, you remember that",Suicide Squad
609,cbak223,Harley Qu...Suicide Squad,8,7 August 2016,"There is a new era that we have been fast approaching for some time, and now we are in full force of its presence, that era being every single comic book,video game,cartoon icon we can go in the past and think of is here, and ready for the big screen treatment. Obviously with the advancement of film technology, we will see everything come to life before our very eyes. It is a good time to be alive, I've seen Wolverine one of the most iconic, not to mention favorite for many years come to life through Hugh Jackman, I've seen my childhood toys come to life with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the 90's film not the new CGI Turtles, & even the likes of G.I. Joe and Iron man, there is literally something for everyone. Superman being one of my favorite characters of all time I've had the pleasure to see him re-imagined in great form from Brandon Routh, but not being what casting directors/producers wanted, Henry Cavill has proved to be very good indeed. Everyone thought Ben Affleck cast as Batman was a poor choice, I disagree he has proved to be good as well, we'll truly see in Justice League. Now, enter the most eclectic group of ""superheroes"" the comics have ever produced,The Suicide Squad. Just setting this up was probably one of those feel good moments, from pre-production meetings with all cast and crew, you knew you could have something special here. The events of the story take place after Batman Vs. Superman so I would suggest watching it before you watch Suicide Squad. Now setting up the right cast for so many characters was probably very challenging, are they right for this iconic role, or not. Now from the start most people are seeing this for one character alone, Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) she had to be stoked at the opportunity to play one of the most iconic female characters ever, and she nailed it. She had the look, the voice, and the demented psycho killer badass valley girl character down to a T. The film is mainly driven with all its characters but set up and run by Viola Davis, she is a black ops C.I.A. Bad ass that works only to preserve the safety and security of the united states. She gathers together the rag tag group most of which are in prison for numerous crimes, Diablo(Jay Hernandez) who can control fire, and then there's the killer croc, a literal man/crocodile played by Adewale Agbeja, who looks the part for sure, make up artist deserves an award just for his make up alone. Now you enter DeadShot(Will Smith) who basically takes point for the group because they are leveraging him with his daughter, he needs this job to get done. Then you have your few Anti- Superheroes that help with the story slightly but are almost side notes, like Boomerang(Jai Courtney) who fights a little but is there mostly as comic relief, and Katana( Karen Fukuhara) who's personal vengeance is already there she killed the man that killed her husband and trapped his soul in her sword, I know you just have to go see it. So as you can see it's a cast of many characters some of which I didn't even list here, but I can't leave out The Enchantress(Cara Delevingne) her character was actually visually stunning, the CGI and make up work for her was superb, she is basically the whole reason for the film taking over the body of a human, she is an ancient God who is frustrated and wants to destroy humanity and releases her brother unto the world, thus setting up the need for the Suicide Squad. Written and directed by David Ayer, who's no stranger to writing with the likes of Training Day,Street Kings, and Fury staring Brad Pitt which I thought was a great film, overall I gave this film an 8/10, it's not a 7 and there are few things I would have changed to give it a 9, hell with a few good tweaks this film had the potential to be a 10, but I'll save that for the stand alone Harlequin film.",Suicide Squad
610,BecauseIAmBATMAN,Entertaining enough but a missed potential,6,7 August 2016,"So much after the critical disappointment of Batman v Superman, the next film in the DC universe Suicide Squad had gotten a similar thrashing of negativity from the critics. I disagree with the critical consensus of Batman v Superman (Love the Ultimate Edition, which is a much superior film to the original theatrical cut) but I don't think the critics are very wrong about Suicide Squad.Starting off with my problems with the film. First is Jared Leto as Joker. He wasn't Jokery enough for me. He looked pretty serious most of the time. But the amount of screen time and the kind of role he had wasn't enough to make an strong impression. Secondly, it tried too hard to be like Guardians of the Galaxy. I know some people made this comparison before the film was released but I never believed it or cared about it except then until I saw it. From the tone, the soundtrack, the brand of humour, a bland villain and the relatively simple nature of the plot. Except this one didn't work as well as Guardians. Thirdly, a rushed change in Dynamic between the Squad. For being untrustworthy bad guys they turned into a Fast and Furious like 'family' pretty quick. It feels like a lot of scenes were chopped up sacrificing the storytelling. The final fight has a 'been there done that' syndrome. The villains looked interesting visually though.As for what I loved- The Suicide Squad, the cast did a fantastic job. Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn single-handedly saved the film for me. She was absolutely brilliant and reminded me of the 90s Batman, the animated series from where she originated from. Will Smith has some funny dialogues. Character development for Deadshot, Harley Quinn and El Diablo was well done. It also contains Jai Courtney who is an otherwise a very bland actor give an entertainingly energetic performance as Captain Boomerang. I found it to be well paced and events occurring in real time added a sense of danger. It also has a unique sense of style.It contains a ton of DC related fan-service and Easter eggs, which may it tough for a DC fan to dislike the film. The film is pretty darn entertaining. There are a lot of flaws but none of them prevented me to walk out with a smile in my face. But when you think about it, it falls apart and feels like a missed potential to do something great. Overall, a disappointment.6.5/10",Suicide Squad
611,Kazombie,A decent action film with never before seen DC characters.,6,5 August 2016,"As always, RT nonsense score and reviews aside, I went in with no expectations. I love my comic books (DC & Marvel) both. Both publishing houses have created some of the best fictional characters out there. Suicide Squad has always been a side project of sorts including in the comic books. The movie for me was taken as such. That is exactly what I got. A 7/10 comic book action flick which had some great action sequences with Deadshot. Harley and Joker didn't do much for me and neither did the rest of the 'squad'. We are lucky to be living in such wonderful times where comic book film adaptations are a plenty. In my days, we were lucky to get one film in years. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film. I would say do not believe RT, IMDb ratings or Marvel fanboys. Go in with an open mind and enjoy a decent action film.",Suicide Squad
612,Alexander_Thomas_Wilson,Heavily OverPromotion of The Joker... You screwed us DC/Warner Bros.,1,7 August 2016,"The movie was meh, so and so. That's not the real thing that bothers me. Actually after this, I don't even care about the movie. WHERE IS THE JOKER ? Where is Jared Leto? Where is all that heavy promotion, hiding him in the trailer just to pop up at the end to get us all excited. All those interviews and stuff. All for nothing, I'll tell ya. DC/Warner Bros. promoted The Joker so much that actually put a thought on people's head (even mine a little bit), that he actually might get close to Heath Ledger's performance. For a year we've been debating, me and my friends with me always insisting that LEDGER IS A GOD for the performance of Joker. And that has been proved now. The Joker has no more than 1-2 minute scenes and all romantic and stuff. That's not what Joker is. Joker is ruthless, psychopath, freaky, schizophrenic... not all this.

Much better, but still below average movie.",Suicide Squad
614,greg-e-porter,"Suicide Squad was mediocre at best but more-so disappointing because of its potential but, at the same time, it doesn't quite deserve all the hate it is getting.",4,1 September 2016,"In the superhero world which has Batman and Superman, what if we were able to convince supervillains - like Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn (Robbie) and the world's top assassin Deadshot (Smith) - to fight for good? That's the premise of Suicide Squad. It sounds like fun. Who doesn't love a good group of anti-heroes? And can you get any better than comic book anti-heroes? Unfortunately, terrible writing and poor decisions spell doom for this potentially fun superhero flick.The movie opens to the music of The Animals' ""House of the Rising Sun"". We see an intimidating high security prison so, I suppose, we're to assume that there are some pretty mean characters being housed here. We meet our first inmate, Deadshot (Smith), and watch his interaction with a sadistic guard. Aside from the fact that Deadshot is in a prison, we aren't really given any reason why he's a villain. Never mind the fact that this is Will Smith we're talking about. When is he really ever a bad guy? A Bad Boy, maybe, but not a bad guy.We then cut over to meet Harley Quinn (Robbie). Grace's rendition of ""You Don't Own Me"" plays as we see Quinn lounging about her cell that sits in the middle of a heavily guarded room. The same sadistic guard approaches her and flirts with the supervillain. The bars on her cell are electrified, throwing her to her back into a daze. We cut to a flashback of the guards (led by the sadistic one) force feeding the crying Quinn and even taking a selfie with her while she is bound. Again, we might have some association with Harley Quinn (being the significant other to the Clown Prince of Crime) but we don't know that she's a villain. We continue to meet other people but you get the ideaThe Suicide Squad, as we learn, is the brainchild of a stone cold military woman. She opens a binder labeled ""Top Secret"" and proceeds to introduce each member. Each of the what, 5 or 6 people, have a several minute expository clip. It begins with a still shot of a given character which has their name and some interesting facts about them. It's a tired method of introducing characters and, man, does it take up a lot of time. We're like 20 minutes into the movie it feels like and we haven't even assembled the team! It's almost like we sat through a promotional short film for the actual movie. I'd kinda prefer if that were the case because we might be able to have a better movie in a year or two.The most painful part about Suicide Squad, and I mentioned this in the bottom-line, is that there was so much potential. Leaving the theatre, I kinda wanted to go and see it again because, maybe, it would be different. That's a sign of a healthy relationship, am I right? Save yourself the time and money and pass on Suicide Squad at least in terms of a theater visit. I'd recommend watching one of the Avengers movies if you want a comic book action movie, or maybe Dark Knight if you want a darker comic book movie with a lot of action. Now I've got a few bones to pick so mind yourself of spoilers.There are so many things about Suicide Squad (both big and small) that don't work. One thing, as I mentioned, is the team introductory montage. It's unnecessarily drawn out and it bogs down the rest of the movie. Now, at one point, the story's main villain attacks (I'll keep it vague to protect against spoilers). The main military guy who leads the squad knows what happened. Eventually, Will Smith confronts him and says, ""You know what happened. Tell us."" So the military guy proceeds to tell them (and us) what happened. Meanwhile, we watch it happen again. We saw it the first time...you know, like, when it happened. Why are you wasting precious minutes actually recycling footage? I mean, sure, there's that film making adage ""show don't tell"" but, guys, I don't think this is what it means.Even down to the main plot of the movie - so and so is trying to destroy the world - feels tired. You're doing something wrong if ""the world is going to end"" feels dull. Just because they live in a world with Batman and Superman, doesn't mean that there are different fish to fry (not bigger but different). The lame plot is, perhaps, just an indication or symptom of Suicide Squad's biggest offender: the writing.The actors do a fine job with what they're given but they aren't given much. The character development is nigh non-existent. We only get a few moments where we see the potential of Harley's character. We see glimpses of her relationship with the Joker (Leto) and her feelings but they don't go anywhere.In the case of Deadshot, just having bits of dialog to show that he loves his daughter isn't character development. He's the highest paid assassin in the world (and along with that, I'd be surprised if he only killed ""bad guys"" but the movie doesn't get into that) and he was captured because his daughter didn't want him to kill his captor. Did his capture get him to reflect on his life choices? Hardly (or if it did, I wasn't feelin' it).",Suicide Squad
615,isaiahwilson15,"DC shows improvement, but still disappoints with Suicide Squad",7,10 August 2016,"Going into 2016, Suicide Squad was actually my second most anticipated superhero movie behind only Captain America Civil War. The marketing team did an absolute superb job selling this movie through some of excellently edited trailers and an surprisingly good original soundtrack, an addition that should be considered by more studios. By the time August came around, I had reached a level of excitement almost equal to that of Guardians of The Galaxy. Unfortunately, I left the theatre disappointed, but hopeful for the future of DC films. OK, so I know my tone may seem overly negative, but let me say that I really did enjoy the film. Much like Batman V. Superman, it does not deserve the reviews it's been getting from critics. The film improves upon DC's previous outing by introducing a much more lighthearted tone, at least for the film's first half, crafting a more clear and linear story, and also featuring better character development. Suicide Squad has many of the elements of a typical summer blockbuster which can't help but make it entertaining. While it may not have met my expectations, it still proved to be another enjoyable superhero movie, and that's enough for me. However, as I previously mentioned, this film has an abundance of flaws. While I did do a good amount of nit-picking, there a couple of particular problems that can't be ignored. The first lies in Suicide Squad's villain. I'm sure I'm not the first to say it, but just about everything about the Enchantress is bad. To begin, she was mistakenly marketed as being a member of the team, which lead many (including me) to believe Monster T would be the villain! Her ""host"" or whatever June Moore adds absolutely nothing to the story. Her brother is just a big pile of confusing CGI mess. Finally, her evil plan to destroy the world is given no backstory or motivation. Suicide Squad also suffers from an editing process that structures the movie in a very unusual way that screws up the pacing as well as the overall tone of the movie, which makes a dramatic shift from lighthearted and fun to dark and gritty. Finally, there's the Joker. I thought Jared Leto did a great job creating one of the most unique Joker's that has ever been portrayed on the big screen. However, I believe there isn't enough of him in the movie to formulate a fair assessment of his performance. One thing I can criticize is his role in the movie, which I felt did not fit. The Joker is mainly just there for some flashbacks that make the mistake of cramming a movie's worth of backstory into a couple of scenes. I understand that he wasn't supposed to have a major role, but I believe the tease David Ayer did give us did not fully represent the notorious Clown Prince of Crime. Suicide Squad is full of potential, and I believe going forward, this will be a great learning opportunity for DC. It shows how to successfully market a movie, provides a glimpse of how to incorporate a more lighthearted tone without being campy, and also displays the importance of proper character development. Repeat this process and then improve upon the movie's faults, and nothing would stop me from seeing a Suicide Squad 2.",Suicide Squad
616,darryl-42069,"Enjoyable, but not as expected",4,6 August 2016,"Before I start, I want to make a shout-out that:BEWARE OF SPOILERS!!!At first I believe that DC universe can be as good as Marvel, now I doubt that.What should be the holy grail of the DC universe, the movie's begins with an enjoyable first act. The introduction of the huge cast is good enough for people to know their backstories. But once it enters it's second act, it's safe to say that the rest of the movie is a chaotic, all-guns-blazing action scenes and weak dialogue, which makes the movie not as expected as the trailer says. The acting of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Viola Davis are the best out of the cast. The three, who played Deadshot, Harley Quinn, and Amanda Waller really stand out and the only ones who saved what was going to be a disastrous movie. El Diablo's backstory is great and he's a good scene stealer alongside Quinn. The Joker is great but it's disappointing that he appeared for only about 20 minutes when the trailers shows a lot of his scenes. I also liked the Joker-Quinn side story. The action scenes are great but for me it's a little excessive. The CGI was good but it got worse on several scenes, some even seems really fake and simply ridiculous. The story is the worst of all the comic book movies I've ever watched. The story makes no sense that I don't even know who's the baddie here. Some characters were simply a well decorated background, they had small screen time and little backstory, which is a waste of great talent and a great letdown. Killer Croc and Katana were an example of them. Katana even spoke Japanese here and only has ONE English sentence, which is truly disappointing. Oh, and who's Slipknot?Is it a great action movie? Yes it is, but is it a good superhero movie? I don't think so. Suicide Squad is an enjoyable action movie, but one of the worst comic book movie adaptation.

BUT! I just didn't know how much. I'll make it short. The dialogue is cliché The story is cliché The story at times didn't make sense There were too many ideas & characters thrown together at the same time so it didn't make sense and really didn't do anything.. ""Solid""- as if the movie is a few incomplete movies. Plus, they didn't need these many characters. Almost no character development. Cliché *Spoilers* The Joker (which I didn't really find this interesting. Yeah, here and there's a bit of a nice joke but that's it) did not contribute IN ANYTHING regarding to the plot except for the exposition. Hell, all he did in the movie is to make it a bit longer and a sad attempt in the end to show there will be a second movie or some kind of sequel.Another character is the climbing guy. I don't even remember his name. WHY THEY NEEDED HIM!? ALL HE DOES IS TO DIE. You can even tell he is not going to live because he is the only one in the s.squad to not have exposition. If he had one it would have made his death more surprising and interesting.The Australian and the Japanese girl added nothing. They made almost, if at all, no change in the plot. So did the croc-guy. And the human-torch had 1 thing to do in the movie - Become another super-powered being so he can stall the bad guy and get redemption.Do you realize that if the boss-woman hadn't made the suicide squad in the first place, the witch thingy wouldn't have happened? OH AND THE WITCH THINGY!The ""Villain""(????). No actual motives except ""yaarrggg I'm evil"". She builds a weapon. OK. What the weapon does? NOBODY KNOWS AND ITS NOT EXPLAINED PROPERLY (If at all).

620,bardia-moose,"The Actors Save A Very Flawed, Yet Fun Movie",5,5 August 2016,"If I had to describe 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman' with one word only, it would be ""divisive."" SUICIDE SQUAD falls into the same category. Even though I liked both MoS and BvS, one could say that those 2 films tried too hard to please critics. The admirable thing about SUICIDE SQUAD is that it disregards the critics altogether, and makes it an entirely fan experience, for better or worse depending on who you ask. The audience I saw it with was electrifying; it's, without a doubt, the most fun I've had all year since 'Deadpool' back in February. In my humble opinion, SUICIDE SQUAD is exactly what this lacklustre summer movie season needed to spice things up. Director David Ayer has his mark all over this; it's unlike any superhero movie I've ever seen. Sure, you have some of your typical superhero tropes, mostly in the 3rd act. But then you have the antithesis of what the genre entails, breaking just about every single rule and convention. This ain't good versus bad; this, my friends, is bad versus evil. This movie is the living personification of its own characters: absolute, bat sh*t insanity! It's uneven, character motivations get a little wonky, and the story is a hot, sexy, mess. Word of advice? Double down on the absurdity of it all; it gets pretty weird. But within all the madness, I couldn't help myself guys... I kind of loved this movie. It's by no means perfect, but I also feel like critics are over exaggerating the film's faults. I was never bored, not once. The film moves at a killer pace. There's quite a bit of exposition near the beginning, but after that the film kicks into high gear. Steven Prince's score, which was reminiscent of 'Pacific Rim' and the first 'Iron Man,' infused such infectious energy into the movie. The use of hit song after hit song got a bit overwhelming however, making the movie feel more like a music video at times.Filmed mostly in my home of Toronto, this was quite the surreal experience; I have walked through those streets before, and I have stood in those subway stations before. I was even an extra in the film. Did I make the cut? Well, that's a whole other story... but I ain't mad.I was genuinely shocked by how incredible Will Smith was in the role of Deadshot. Going in, I thought he'd be adequate but not too memorable. I was wrong; he is the best thing this movie has going for it. Scratch that. He comes real close to taking that title, but it's Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn that this movie will be long remembered for. She nails it. Absolutely nails it. Robbie is to Harley Quinn what RDJ is to Tony Stark: perfection. Joel Kinnaman was another standout for me. While the writing for his character felt the most forced out of everyone, his actual performance sells it well and makes me feel for a character I could, otherwise, care less for. The film is juggling a lot of characters, and that's never an easy task. Characters such as Killer Croc, Katana, and Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney was great?!) aren't given much backstory at all, but they were all given at least one great character moment: just one scene to make you fall in love with them. But if there's one obscure character that'll emerge as a fan favourite, it's definitely El Diablo. He's given a thoughtful backstory, an emotional character arc, and some kick ass action sequences. In fact, most of the action in the film was executed well. But there wasn't that one moment, like the 'warehouse scene' we got in BvS, that made me go ""holy sh*t"". if you ask me, Jared Leto had the toughest job of them all; he had to follow Heath Ledger's timeless performance as The Joker, which is an impossible feat. So, the best thing Leto could've done is something completely different; he should make it his own. Which is exactly what he did. Whenever he's on screen you can't help but be captivated by him. He's not in the movie all that much, but just enough to wet our appetites for this whole new incarnation of 'The Clown Prince of Crime,' while still honouring the name of the film. This is a Suicide Squad movie after all, not a Joker movie. It's ironic that in a movie about bad guys the worst part turned out to be the villain itself. The 'evil' in bad versus evil, if you will. I would've preferred a different antagonist altogether as the one we got here was pretty forgettable. Without giving any spoilers, the whole 'brother' angle was by far the worst thing in this movie. That's all I will say. People comparing this movie to last year's catastrophe 'Fantastic Four' need to drop whatever it is they're smoking. SUICIDE SQUAD has something that film didn't: personality. It has soul. There's a great deal of heart. The characters are dynamic. The team chemistry between all the actors was fantastic; even if you don't like the movie they're in, you'll still end up liking the Suicide Squad themselves. Am I saying you're gonna love this film?

621,jeromewillner,"If ever a movie stumbled in the delivery of promised greatness, it was surely this one. Unmissable !",8,23 December 2020,"A strong and confident beginning establishes characters, structure, and seeds the outline of a great story. The flaws appear quite early on though and lie in the chemistry between the anti-heroes. The mix isn't quite right, and causes the plot to become muddied and confused. Like mixing ingredients in a cake, the wrong combination of flavours confuses the pallete, and ruins what might otherwise have been delicious. Some characters work, and others don't fare so well. Harley Quinn, and Joker with their 'twisted' partnership have sensational possibilities, only partially explored, and all the better for it. Deadshot mis-casts Will-Smith and brings a baggage of conflicted morality that does not rhyme with the overall theme. Katana and Croc just don't seem to fit anywhere convincing, while Rick Flag's character, was both mis-cast and under-developed. El Diablo's potential was under-used, while the Enchantress and Amanda Waller both make strong starts that are defeated by weaknesses in the script and plot. Given the sheer number of characters, it's no surprise the result was a bit of a puddle. Hopefully a re-boot can revive the best elements that were only kindled here, and give them a chance to achieve the glory they are probably capable of. If ever a movie stumbled in the delivery of promised greatness, it was surely this one.",Suicide Squad
622,mymtproject,This movie had great moments,5,2 November 2016,"I neither loved nor hated Suicide Squad. It was fun movie to watch, although the villain left something to be desired. Enchantress is okay as a minor baddie but not as the main baddie. Not enough time was spent telling her story in relation to her brother. Why he was he more powerful than her, yet had to be freed and controlled by her? Her plan was also a bit unconvincing, like she made it up as she went along. I believe if they had made her a puppet of a distant being, like Darkseid, it would have been more believable. He could have controlled her and her brother, tried to use them to destabilize Earth so he could take over easier. Oh well, what could have been! As for the Suicide Squad themselves, El Diablo, Deadshot and Harley Quinn where given good backstories. Katana had a bit of history but almost nothing was shown about Killer Croc or Captain Boomerang. 10-15 more minutes wouldn't have hurt the movie in order to know more about them. For me, Jared Leto's Joker was one of the more refreshing characters, mainly because they ""mobbed him up"" a bit. Some fans hated this treatment but I thought was great! He was scary with his manic stares and highly unpredictable actions. Even his minions seemed on edge around him, possibly wondering if they were next on his list. I enjoyed watching his portrayal. So here's where I come down on SS. The movie was worth the price of admission as good entertainment. It certainly is far above Superman V Batman and makes me believe DC is on course to making better comic book films. The plot was a bit unclear and the villain was weak. Figuring in both factors, it's a 50-50 split, so 5 out of 10.",Suicide Squad

Doctor Strange and Rogue One are way better then this movie.And even though Suicide Squad won a Oscar, the Oscars are pretty terrible now.",Suicide Squad
624,Snatchy,This is what happens when the filmmakers have zero belief in the material,1,10 June 2017,"The Suicide Squad was a relatively short-lived comic book series about a bunch of B-list supervillains who reluctantly agree to work for the US government. While the movie kept that basic premise, everything else about the movie is derivative and loaded with filler. Not a single original idea or concept is brought in.The first half of the movie actually showed some promise. The appeal of the concept has always been that the supervillains were more fun than the superheroes because a) they don't play by those pesky rules of morality, b) they don't actually like each other or the people they're working for. However, the movie quickly devolves in the second half as the filmmakers try to make the characters (at least the ones they bothered to give personalities) human and sympathetic, but in the most corny and ham-fisted way possible.The biggest problem of the movie is Will Smith. They kept calling him Deadshot, but make no mistake about it, he was playing Will Smith. I don't know if the script was written with him in mind, or if they just re-wrote the part when he was cast, but it was essentially the reluctant superhero from Hancock meets the loving father from Pursuit of Happiness meets the smug hotshot from Men In Black. His performance was so out of place that it basically ruined the movie for me.In addition to bringing in Will Smith, the filmmakers brought in Jared Leto as the Joker, even though again, the performance and character had zero to do with the premise or the plot of the movie. Again, it's clear that the filmmakers had no confidence in the source material or concept and jammed in the Joker (and some cameos from Ben Afflec/Batman) as a cheap marketing gimmick.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller had some good moments but was underused, as was pretty much every character other than Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was about the only redeeming quality of the movie.The basic plot is so simplistic, I think they ripped it off from a video game.How the movie made as much money as it did is completely baffling to me.",Suicide Squad

626,ph-nijman,Comics are not (allways) for kids,8,17 September 2016,"And 'Suicide squad' proves it. The trouble I have with most of the Marvel movies and certainly most of the DC TV-series is that they are all made with the 12 to 16 year old's in mind. The last Batman's, Man of steel and Suicide squad all have a grittiness I like. Deadpool could have been a great movie. But the constant joking (i know, it's also in the comics)took the fun out of it. The only memorable part was when he took it up the Khyber. The TV-shows Arrow and Flash are kiddie-shows just a tiny bit less camp than the 1966 Batman-series. Avengers are to flashy. It took 15 years to rebuild the WTC, after the battle of New York (Avengers), the next movie (which one was that? Can't remember) is cruising around NYC like nothing happened But suicide squad is different. OK, you have one-liners and the camaraderie in the end. But only Harley Quinn is the comic relief and you don't get the feeling that in the morning after the ........ all is well. So, was it bad? NO!!!!!! could it be better? Sure, but don't ask me were.",Suicide Squad
627,simonkie,Nice surprise,8,9 May 2017,How do you make a movie with a bunch of villains instead of superheroes and expect to be cheering for them like you would any superhero? Well Suicide Squad does exactly that with an unbelievable mix of some of the most ruthless villains from DC comics. The cast was exceptional and very entertaining with Will Smith and Margot Robbie who plays Harley Quinn and pulled off a fantastic job playing the Joker's queen of chaos. The story was good and the action was awesome. People should never listen to the hype of any movie. I didn't and I went in to this with no expectations. With so many comic book movies out there I was not expecting to be entertained as much as I was watching this. What a fun fantastic idea to bring the villains together to save the world. Very unique and well written. This is one movie that can be watched again and again. You have your Justice League and your Avengers but with the Suicide Squad you have a group that you never know what to expect. They are totally different and that's what makes them and this movie fun fun fun.,Suicide Squad
628,erolsabadosh,Great fun!,8,12 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a film about bad guys joining forces under the watch of the government to fight against an evil being that's been unleashed upon Midway City, a fictional city loosely based on Chicago but transported to Michigan. The team is assembled by government intelligence operative Amanda Waller, played by Viola Davis, and includes a hit-man who never misses called Deadshot (Will Smith), a former gang member who can create and control fire called El Diablo, Australian thief Boomerang, mercenary Slipknot, a sewer dwelling monster called Killer Croc, Cara Delavigne playing a scientist possessed by the spirit of a powerful witch called Enchantress, and the star of the show, Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie.Smith and Robbie absolutely steal the film and are thrilling to watch. There are also a host of familiar characters who crop up throughout including The Joker, played by Jared Leto, Batman & The Flash. The cast is well chosen and all do a great job, although something about Cara Delavigne as Enchantress doesn't quite land, thankfully she's shrouded in CGI and her voice is manipulated so it's not that big a deal but I think the film would have benefited from having someone else play the evil spirit, Delavigne does a fine job as June the scientist but as Enchantress she's just not very enchanting, the way she moves is unintentionally hilarious and quite distracting.The best parts of the film are when the squad are sharing banter, director David Ayer revels in the outlandish personalities and looks of these characters. The script is very serviceable, balancing dialogue, action, humour & horror fairly well. In fact, there really isn't a single moment of the film that isn't fun and exciting. It breezes along at a steady pace and doesn't feel convoluted or complicated in any way; in fact I'd say it's pretty much the most straightforward comic book movie we've seen in a while and one where we have a big cast of characters but a simple narrative that allows us to get to know them and see how they interact without having to worry about a million different plot points. The love story between Joker and Harley brings some unconventional romance to proceedings, and it works. Visually the film excels, from the styling, to the direction and the special effects. It's a joy to watch and looks extremely comic-book like, imagine Robert Rodriguez's Sin City on LSD.I honestly don't understand all of the flack this is getting from critics. In my opinion it's a hundred times better than the woeful Batman Vs Superman. As a David Ayer film it's not quite up there with his previous work, you can tell that there was some studio-pleasing involved in terms of structuring, but as a comic book adaptation I think it gets the job done with a real sense of fun and giddiness. It's very much a Summer crowd-pleaser but there's enough to set it apart from bland studio fare and it's clearly been made with great care and passion. I really hope that if they do another Suicide Squad centred movie that Ayer is on board.",Suicide Squad
629,kurt-2000,Surprisingly Great,9,7 September 2017,"Not Excellent nor lame. Somewhere above average, and entertaining for a film. I normally have limited interest in films based on comic book characters, but I liked this 'B' movie. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto stole the show. I'm very impressed with Robbie's diverse acting skills. The supporting actors did fine and the script was OK, but cartoon-ish. There's nothing wrong with a little diversion from reality, and the special effects were just fine. If you haven't seen it, then I'll recommend it for when you're in an action adventure mood. It's not as bad as the hyperbole made it out to be. Thus the reason for the follow up sequel coming your way.",Suicide Squad

This should not be confused with cinematography, because this movie did not have any of that. The writing was atrocious beyond belief. The dialogues were pointless boring gibberish. People come to see a movie to escape from the mind numbing hackneyed small talk at work. This movie just makes you sit through 2 hours of someone else's mind numbing hackneyed small talk at work. The cast had some heavy hitters, but to no avail. Character development was a joke. It really seems to be a film written and directed by a total amateur, who hasn't the first clue about what makes a movie or a character special. The only reason I'd give this movie any stars was to recognize the effort put in by the folks in special effects and make up crew that contributed to this film. They did a good job.",Suicide Squad
631,sergioschout,OK-ish film but I expected more.,6,4 August 2016,"In all honesty I would give the movie a 6.5/10 but it fails to preform for a 7/10. Pros for the the movie: absolutely great cast, all in all good story kind of in the DC universe setting and lore. Bad things: Well the plot and script are kind of a bag of mixed things. It is not as bad as the recent ghostbusters but it fails to deliver( especially in the end). A rather big group of people that sat in front of me were grumbling quite a lot (i assume that they were fans)Conclusion: is it worth the 18$ entrance fee? Well it depends. I kind of liked it but some aspects ( shoddy humor also in the movie) so I am on the fence a bit. If you like DC and comics in general, you should go and watch it in the theaters but if you are a casual movie lover, wait until it is on hulu, vudu or netflix ( or on bluray) Is the ""curse of DC"" broken? Well this movie was OK-ish but saying that the curse has been broken is a bridge too far in my opinion.",Suicide Squad

634,zaidmnomani,The Very Definition of a Bad Movie,3,11 May 2020,"Suicide Squad is a pretty terrible film. The premise is promising, and it's enjoyable in a so bad it's good way, but that's all the praise that I'm capable of giving this film. Every aspect of this film is an absolute failure.The movie features such a large cast that it's hard to develop any of the characters. Harley Quin and Deadshot (and maybe Diablo) are about the only ones that I could say have somewhat of a personality. The rest are merely side characters.Harley's character is that she's crazy and she cracks jokes. Deadshot's character is that he cares about his daughter and every decision he makes is because of her. Diablo is sad because his family died because of him and he refuses to use his powers now. I'd like to remind you that these are the best characters in the film, and yet they all feel one-dimensional and cliche.The plot is something that's been done a million times already. Bad guy escapes from confinement and then shoots a giant laser in the sky to blow up/Terra form the planet. Meanwhile a ragtag group of misfits work together to try and stop him/her with a low chance of them winning *Yawn*.The acting ranges from terrible to okay. Jared Leto stands out as the worst actor in the film, with a performance so bad it seemed like a parody of the Joker. Will Smith is trying to save the film, but his line delivery is off. Margot Robbie is okay. However, the main problem arises in the terrible dialogue, which feels like something that Micheal Bay wrote.The comedy feels forced and cringe worthy. I heard that they were re-shoots with the film to add more jokes and make the tone feel more lighthearted. Clearly DC were trying to copy Marvel movies and make them similar to them in tone. This also explains the futile attempt at having catchy songs shoved in to make it more like Guardians of the Galaxy. Unfortunately, this film lacks any heart that GOTG had.The premise itself is quite idiotic. Why do you need a bunch of villains to save the world when you have much stronger heroes who could do the job better? Most of the members of Suicide Squad barely have any powers that an ordinary military soldier won't have. The only exception is Diablo. Other than him, none of the characters should be the choice to fight a super powered villain.The plot is riddled with contrivances and pointless action. The color palate is dark, vomit like green. The CGI is (as usual with all DC movies) quite garbage looking. Watch this movie if you hate yourself.",Suicide Squad
635,ralo229,The Most Disappointing Film of 2016 I've Seen So Far,4,1 November 2016,"So, I still kept an open mind going into the theater despite the negative reviews that this film received, but I'm sorry. I can't lie to you guys or myself. This movie just wasn't that good.The plot jumped around so much that certain events in the story came off as very rushed and sloppy, most of the characters were incredibly paper thin and underutilized and were incredibly lacking in terms of chemistry, the action wasn't really anything to write home about, and the main villain I found really hard to take seriously due to both an awkward performance by Cara Delivingne and the fact that she spends most of the climax looking like a freaking luau dancer.Now it does have its pros. Like Margot Robbie was really great as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis was really great as Amanda Waller. And most of the humor, while it never had me rolling on the floor laughing, did get a few chuckles out of me. I also appreciate that it focused more on practical effects rather than overloading on computer generated effects. (The action like I said wasn't great, but I was at least able to tell what was going on during the fight scenes, unlike a previous DC film that comes to mind.) But the film's highlight was the first third, hands down, because it both established, what I thought was going to be its style, and introduced the characters wonderfully. I had pretty high hopes during that first act and I'm really ashamed that the rest of the film was just so...blah.So yeah. I was pretty disappointed by this one. Although, I couldn't help but feel that a lot of the film was cut for time given how the film jumped around so much and how the Joker had such a minimal role despite the fact that he was practically the unofficial spokesperson for most of the marketing. If they ever release a director's cut, I'd be willing to see it. But until or if that ever happens, Suicide Squad currently stands as a very uneven and mediocre flick that could've been so much more. It's by no means the worst film I've seen this year, but it is definitely the most underwhelming.4/10",Suicide Squad
636,jdowney-57-371157,Really Poor,3,28 November 2016,"I might throw some spoilers at you, but I will pretty much accept you know the overall concept and kind of focus on why this movie missed so badly.I believe the main reason this movie misses is that they guys behind it just didn't get it. They weren't fanboys, they were movie makers with a job to do. No love, no insight, just standard by the number thinking pervades this movie. They also failed to step up their game relative to Marvel and the Superman reboots. The quality of the Avenger as a group movie just made Suicide Squad seem behind the curve.I can tell you if Marvel was doing this movie, it would have begun completely differently: it would have started with building the Enchantress backstory in ancient Aztec times, thus giving her status and purpose as a massive enemy. What do you gain by seeing Batman round up Deadshot and Harley? And then fast-forwards though every one else? It eats up time with a bunch of stereotypes. And the music - WTF - the same lame guys behind the movie - a bunch of middle-age Jewish guys picking music that they think is 'cool' or edgy? Eminem? seriously? Just horrible.So, the story starts with long drawn out clichés to get us to part two - put the squad in action. Here is where a comparison to Marvel is inevitable. The Avengers was based on grandeur and big thinking. Nick Fury's flying aircraft carriers, Tony Stark's awesome labs, portals to other dimensions. In suicide squad, for some reason, we take a helicopter ride to some city, land in the street and walk. Where Captain American is whipping his shield and Hulk is smashing and Thor is wielding his hammer...we get a guy shooting a gun and Harley with a baseball bat. The whole set reminded me of Racoon City from 15 year old Resident Evil. Even the enemy: soldiers turned into Goo Zombies who pour down the street to get batted and smashed and shot it was dead on Resident Evil. Weak. Very Weak. Nothing Epic.And our team of heroes, just a bunch of guys walking down the street, none of the epic battle sequences that at least Man of Steel / DOJ understood they had to emulate (Ironman upped the game on CGI mega-punching). Nobody does anything cool. Nobody is bigger than life. (OK..Diablo does eventually step up a little with some fire power).I won't complain about any of the acting here, beyond Harley's strange Brooklyn accent (since she is from Gotham). I think the characters were so badly constructed the actors did what was expected. Leto's Joker, lauded by some, didn't seem beyond what any other actor would have done with the character as per this movie.All in all, a visionary could have rethought this movie into something more spectacular, instead we got a step back to something that seemed far behind the cutting edge.Too bad.",Suicide Squad
637,westen1223,"Ignore what the critics say, this film gives it all!",7,3 August 2016,"Thrilling, sophisticated and dark-toned, Suicide Squad delivers a big improvement over the DCEU, with Margot's portrayal as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto's joker. What the critics say is a lie, the film is awesome, exciting and definitely fun to watch, it definitely improved over Batman v Superman, adding some humor and a less darker cinematography.Enchantress was certainly my favourite, the surprise she turns out to be the main villain and her powers are just extraordinary! Cara Delevingne's portrayal was fabulous :) Amanda Waller just demonstrated such ruthless power, determination and antagonistic behaviour which I was extremely pleased about. Now.. Will Smith. Many thought it was a disaster he was cast as a villain / anti-hero but his acting was pretty impressive. Same goes with Jai Courtney, both showed a big surprise to their acting. I wouldn't really listen to what the critics say, this film is extremely dark and hilarious but I only gave it a 9 out of 10 because I thought it could've improved slightly, particularly the Joker's screen-time. He had about 25-30 or more minutes which wasn't enough but other than that, one of the best films of 2016 and certainly the best out of the DCEU (possibly till Wonder Woman <3)However, there were some weak plot holes. Especially when they revealed that Enchantress is the villain of the film. The worst part is that Joker's screen-time was limited and most of the movie was cut out, the majority of the trailer scenes were not even in the film itself. Especially the car chase with the batman, it was so short, not as long as I really hoped. Still, the film did deliver a wonderful masterpiece with its CGI and acting. Suicide Squad, a film which displays a talented cast and adds humor than previous DCEU films but needs to improve its plot and writing.",Suicide Squad

639,keithbrown-90195,An Incompetent Mess,2,1 September 2016,"To start, I don't know anything about any of the characters in this movie. I didn't have any backstory preconceived notions about how they should act. I completely relied on the movie to get me to side with these people. Having said that, the movie begins by introducing us to these characters, in an extremely awkward montage complete with randomly inserted classic rock songs. The introductions are lame because being told about these characters through voice-over is never as interesting as seeing it. Show, don't tell. From there on the movie continues its messy narrative with bits and pieces from about 5 different movies with many lapses in logic and tonal inconsistencies. Nothing in this movie worked for me, not even Deadshot or Harley, who had robotic dialogue that served no purpose other than to highlight their already simplistic personality traits. Maybe they're more well-rounded in the comics, but I'm talking about what I've seen on the screen, and it wasn't anything approaching interesting. I won't talk about anyone else, because the filmmakers clearly didn't care about them.I'm happy people out there are enjoying this. Good for you. I wish I could say there was something here that was redeemable for me.",Suicide Squad
640,MovieSoup,Not one bit of quality,1,2 September 2017,"Suicide Squad made me actually angry and violent at my friend for buying this ""film"" on DVD and letting me watch it without saying how awful it really was. I had read reviews that said it was bad and gave it 4/10 which is a very misleading score as it suggests some quality things about this movie. Honestly if I could give it 0/10 I would but IMDb only lets you do 1/10 as a valid rating. I have nothing but contempt for this movie as it is poor in every sense of the word!!!Let's start with the plot which is just thrown lazily together as if the people who wrote it were just said ""screw it, let's just focus on getting Harley Quinn in as many sexy uniforms as possible and making loads of money at the box office"". The plot boils down to this government woman, Amanda Waller, putting together a team of super villains to fight other super villains..Sounds like a great idea but when this character explains it 3,4,5 bloody times in the movie it gets a bit wearing and stupid. The team consists of Will Smith (deadshot), Margo Robbie (Harley Quinn) and a load of other characters that are not as flushed out with only three of them being integral to the story. I could go on about characters and plot for 1000 alone but I will just list specifically bad characters that deserve a dishonourable mention.Will Smith plays Will Smith in this movie and is awfulllll at playing a villain of any kind. Will Smith can only play heroes so he just doesn't work as a villain. Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn is just there as a sex symbol and she tries to be the comic relief as well. As a comic relief she is sooooo bad with terrible one liners that do not get any laughs and just leave you with your head in your hands. She is sexy in this film but it is so forced that after a while even teenagers will just go MEH and go back to playing candy crush or take drugs (whatever teenagers do now)Another dishonourable mention goes to the Jared Letto Joker. This is probably the worst joker I have seen on film and the portrayal of him as some kind of kingpin/pimp is very off putting. His relationship with Harley Quinn too is wrong and mismatched. I find it hard for the joker to be in love with Harley as he is supposed to be the living embodiment of chaos and having him act as a love sick puppy trying to get back his girl seems completely wrong to other movies I have seen him in. As an example in the dark knight Nolan and Ledger took care to play and wright the joker as he is supposed to be, an anarchist who cares nothing for no one. They wrote him as someone who wants to ""watch the world burn"". In Suicide Squad he is a pimp and has to say that he is chaos TO THE AUDIENCE instead of showing us he is!!My beef with this ""film"" is not just the characters and the stupid plot but also the technical side of things. This movie is so badly edited that it is painful. A few reviews say that this film feels like one big trailer and that is completely down to poor editing. In this movie scenes do not end or begin they just happen and then a next scene comes up and happens and it is just so crap. Because of the editing the pacing suffers as well as this film is slow and fast paced in such an infrequent way that it gave me an aneurysm in my brain. During shooting the trailer house for this movie also edited parts of the film as well so that is probably why the film looks so disjointed. The lighting during the film is terrible as it is just dark and bland with some bits being so dark that the scenes are close to being underexposed. Underexposed is when a film is so poorly lighted that you can't really see what is going on in the film and this ""film"" definitely does that.The soundtrack as well is garbage. They just get all of these great songs from different artists like Queen, ACDC and Black Sabbath and just put them randomly in the movie without any context at all. You can't just fling songs at the wall and see what sticks. Music is supposed to complement the film and add atmosphere. This film does not do that. NOT ONE BIT!!!!I know this has been a long review but there are just so many problems with this film that I just have to say how BAD this movie is and i'm still not done.

I think the reason I enjoyed it so much is that my dumb little brain could only focus on the good ideas the movie DID have and not everything that ruins these ideas & elements from reaching their true potential. There is a lot to love in this film, but it is always paired with something equally bad or worse.Overall the notable characters are well done on a surface level. Rick Flag, Captain Boomerang, and Amanda Waller are all done well enough keeping in mind what they were given to work with. EL Diablo was very interesting and it one of the more developed of the bunch (Side note, I was CONVINCED that his death was a fakeout and he was going to appear again in the DCEU... guess not). Will Smith does a surprisingly great job with the character of Deadshot and I really hope we see more of him in the universe moving forward, even if it is just as a cameo. Most people would say Harley Quinn is the best-done character, but she is actually one of my biggest problems with the picture. While wonderfully acted by Margot Robbie, the character is a dumbed-down version of their comic counterpart. Harley is supposed to be a highly intelligent woman who uses a ditz persona to get a tactical edge in combat both physically and psychologically. While Suicide Squad does a better job at conveying this than Birds of Prey, she doesn't come off as more than a dumb, over-sexualized hoe. Irilocally, I much preferred the Joker. While a HUGE departure from what we come to expect, I love this Joker's absolutely chaotic mannerisms and think many people could grow to like him if he was given the right time to develop. The only character I truly have a problem with is Killer Croc due to ti his size, but I hope that they can find an excuse to beef him up and have him return in a better movie.I love the neon-punk aesthetic and the concept of the fast-paced editing to convey the insane concept of a supervillain team, but the editing is so chaotic that it near makes the movie incomprehensible. The final cut was edited by a trailer house and it definitely shows, often including scenes out of order, skipping important development, and straight-up lying to the audience. This just makes the already bad story so much worse.This movie not only underdeveloped the Joker as a weird B-plot side villain but also gives us the most generic villain of the DCEU in Enchantress. According to the film, Waller created the Squad to protect against potential meta-human threats only to have Enchantress rouge despite the fact he is controlled by the one who holds her heart (Waller herself) and is killed when her heart is destroyed. Despite these being the only two things we know about Enchantress, these facts prove completely false within the first act of the film. WOW. If this film was ever going to work, it should have gone in one of two directions:A) Spend the first act of the film to establish the relationship between Rick Flag and Dr. Moon, eventually leading to Enchantress becoming a threat and forcing Amanda and Rick to gather the Suicide Squad to stop her. Then you could use the flashback montage sequences to establish each character alongside how they were brought into the team. This way we can keep the drama focused on Rick Flag and his conflict to save or Kill Enchantress. OR...B) Have the Joker take over Arkham Asylum and hold the warden hostage with many smaller villains working with him to keep out the police. This would force Amanda to use criminals held in other facilities to create the Suicide Squad. We could use Harley Quinn as the main character as we follow her trying to leave the Squad and join the Joker but form a connection with the team and ultimately chose to gain her independence and bring Joker into custody. This way we can spend more time fleshing out the history of Harley and Joker with an emotional connection.At the end of the day, this movie has a lot of cool ideas. The montages and the licensed music aren't really the problem, but a painful casualty of a lack of direction and focus. If only we could have seen the amazing movie this concept started when it was written. Unfortunately, this is all we have for now.",Suicide Squad
645,lmcressia,This movie is... OK.,4,11 December 2016,"As the title says, this movie is OK. There were a couple occasions in the first 45 minutes that I considered turning it off -- but because of the hype, and because I am a sucker for comic book movies, I kept watching. It improved... some. It is mildly entertaining, so if you have nothing better to do, give it a shot.The story. The movie needed about 90 minutes more to make the story coherent, but since the story was not good anyway, I guess it is just as well that they went through it fast.The Joker. He was not in it too much. Turns out, I am OK with that. It was an attempt to show a lunatic-type Joker, but it just didn't work. Its not just Heath Ledger's shadow -- he was not great even without that looming over him. There were a couple of lines that were delivered well, but mostly it was very underwhelming.Harley Quinn. I'm not a fan in the first place, but I was not impressed.Deadshot. Will Smith was the best of a bad bunch of actors, but he certainly was average at best, himself.Killer Croc. Geez. I wanted to like this guy, but... He was hard to understand and he looked odd. I know, he's a crocodile... I don't mean that. I mean his head was massive for his body and it looked weird. Speaking of which, Batman... WTF. I HATE this costume. Same one from Batman v Superman where batman has no neck.Bommerang, or whatever his name was. Pass. This dude had WAY more lines then he needed. Totally extraneous.Climbing Guy. Who didn't see this guy with no discernible skill disappearing quick.Viola Davis -- whoever she was playing. Goodnight, that was a poor character with poor lines who was poorly acted.Weird zoom shot. So toward the end, the camera just conspicuously zooms from wide-angle to zoomed in... Its not a problem, per se, I just haven't seen it in a movie since 1981.The characters were rushed. I did not care about anyone in the movie. The story was too big to be told in the time allotted. It just did not work.",Suicide Squad
646,ssunny-social,Rotten Tomatoes Aren't Wrong this Time,4,7 August 2016,"Like any DC fan boy, I was waiting for this with bated breaths. But stepping in and seeing the way it starts, kills you. The film falls apart right from the beginning: The witch and her brother who come without much background, decide to go for a demolition plan, again in a massive scale without a lot of depth to their motivation to build a machine to destroy all of mankind. We have only been introduced to how the unconventional Task Force X have a difficulty getting through, against all the restrictions from the government and just when we expect to see more of a slow elation towards the build up: finally gelling together and hitting it off, they're brought together, just like that and made to fight against the opposite forces. Harley Quin was only as good as the trailers while the Joker disappointed and don't pin this on the benchmark Heath set, even if we see this as an independent performance, this is shallow. It is clichéd beyond understanding, it almost makes you wonder whether this is an English language Bollywood film: the daughter issue, the boy friend issue, the brother issue, the girl friend issue, you have it all, the only thing I missed was an ""aaa aa aaa"" sung in chorus by a Karan-Johar-regular orchestra that I am used to with so much drama. Are they really the villains we were looking forward to? Not Me!",Suicide Squad
647,lancelong777,Just Boring,1,10 August 2016,"Gosh darnit, I waited and waited for this movie to come out and then it does and it was just the biggest letdown of all time. Where do I start? I think the problem was really just that the characters were completely undeveloped and therefore uninteresting. Maybe that was the intention since they were supposedly a squad of super heroes that the American Government was willing to throw away. I hope the second half was really good, I wouldn't know as I left before the ending. You know, we suspend our disbelief to go to movies to start with so we are prepared to see unbelievable things and believe it for the sake of the movie. But, I had a hard time doing this for the Suicide Squad. They truly painted unbelievable things unbelievably and that makes me mad. Will Smith didn't help the problem much with his presence. He is like the typecast actor that doesn't get jobs because people see him as a character once beloved. Only, he continues to be cast in role after role and acts exactly the same way in every movie. I understand why Jared Leto had his role cut down - because he would have been the only interesting character to watch in this stupid film. Do not make a part two. Especially if you can't find some kind of anti-heroes that possess some form of originality.",Suicide Squad
648,bland-kevin67,Great Movie!!,8,16 September 2016,I really liked this movie. It was boarder line epic and the directing was very well done. Leto made a new Joker that reminds me of the the beloved cartoon character. I stopped reading comics many years ago but the little background stories got me caught up. Not a big Will Smith acting fan but the ensemble cast helped me deal with a his over acting. The usual enemy premise trying to destroy the world has the same comic book logic as if there are no other heroes available and the town they're in is the epicenter of the world. I think this was better than Batman vs. Superman. I would watch it again and you can tell the writer is a true fan of the comics. I was too crazy about how many kills took place but the flow was pretty good leaving you to want more. The Marvel method of hero fitting the dilemma is also annoying but OK.,Suicide Squad
649,sukanya-samy,Watch it for Margot Robbie,7,28 October 2016,"I admit, I didn't know much about the Suicide Squad characters and who is in the 'bad guys' team and neither did I try to read up too much about them.Maybe that is why I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.Ya it had its weaknesses. It had big plot holes (like why would a super- witch fight in a hand-to-hand combat when she could take away all the weapons?) and lies as marketing (where was Jared Leto as the next-crazy- method-acting-maniacal Joker other than those few minutes on the screen?), but if you leave all that aside, it was a fun watch.Lets look at the bad first. We didn't get to know the back stories of the characters except Dead Shot, played by Will Smith; who is a hit-man but a devoted father and Harley Quinn, played brilliantly by Margot Robbie, the psychiatrist who falls in love with the Joker and he makes her into a over-the-top-sexual deranged, crazy person. I still don't know about the characters which is a pity. And that is one of the big problems isn't it?Why would they fight as a squad when there is nothing in common for them to fight for?- they were let free after Rick Flag destroys the instrument that could be used to blow the bomb-chips inside their bodies. Why would Diablo, played well by Jay Hernandez who is guilty as hell of killing his own family join forces with a bunch of crazies? Who is Killer-Croc, what is his story? Why does Boomerang keep a stuffed- horse with him? So the whole movie was not driven by characters – which was what it was supposed to be.The climax reminded me of Ghostbusters – the Sigourney Weaver one where she gets possessed and tries to bring hell on earth – which doesn't say much. The climax should have been more, I wanted more.But in spite of many loopholes, me as an average movie goer will love this movie, especially if I don't know much about the actual Suicide Squad. I was entertained, pretty much through the movie (compared to the recent ones I saw like Independence Day and Jason Bourne) – it was paced okay, there were some light moments and I loved Margot Robbie – she was made into this sexual-bimbo, but which heroine today isn't? At least she owned the craziness that the character is supposed to own. It was her movie along with Will Smith's who showed the swagger that he owns.Come on people, don't overthink this one when you are watching it and you will have fun.",Suicide Squad
650,TyJustice,Hopefully a wakeup call for the DCEU's future.,2,4 February 2018,"Suicide Squad is fundamentally one of those ""if done correctly"" stories. Even before you embark on the journey this movie takes you on, you ask yourself ""if the threat is so big, why not call any of the good guy superheroes in this universe?"" And the movie struggles to answer that - instead elects to brush the question to the side with a mindless suggestion that the world needs a line of defense in case Superman falls out of line. The band of characters we follow throughout the story are remarkably unlikable and a handful of them are given virtually nothing to do in the plot. If you subscribe to the logic of ""your movie is only as good as it's villain"" you would certainly be right in the case of this movie because the threat that looms over the movie spends a lot of the time bordering between ""immensely boring"" and ""logically ridiculous"".Suicide Squad also brings us the first live action film adaptation of ""The Joker"" since Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight, and I don't think Jared Leto comes anywhere near matching the larger than life Joker portrayals we've seen anywhere in the past, quite possibly being the worst Joker we've ever seen in a movie. I don't want to write off Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn however, with a proper script and story to fit into I think she can do Quinn justice. I wouldn't recommend checking this one out, it will surely be a disappointing film.",Suicide Squad

But with too many plot holes, predicatble chracters, poor chracter development, and cringey one liners, I had to leave. The only interesting thing about this movie is the costumes. The music was pandering way too much and seemed as though it was there just to try and elevate a scene that was ****. Batman, out of every superhero has the best rogue's gallery hands down. And this movie made me hate every single one. I never want to see another Zach Snyder film again. Why studios keep throwing money at him, I'll never know. It seems as if he's perfectly fine catering to cringey/edgey teens who only shop at hot topic and like abusive relationships. If you love DC at all, or even commics for that matter, do NOT see this movie. It will make you want to rip your hair out.",Suicide Squad

It really doesn't leave out any of the entertaining bits in the trailers. The film felt congested of songs and jokes. It seemed as if it was aimed to have it be a good experience instead of a film. Joker scenes were edited so tight you almost couldn't see his face. They were also flashbacks and it really just felt rushed.Will Smith proves he can't do a villain. He was bad and kept talking about how bad he was or threatening to fight but it just wasn't there. The acting of the entire film was on point and the added color did look cool. Just wasn't what I thought it would be.When no one important ever dies it doesn't feel like the idea of real threat weighs down; and it didn't. Tired of all the CGI villains. Civil War did it right, this just eh. It was too Hollywood and they should have made it more unique. Again, not horrible but not great.",Suicide Squad

654,vaultoverseer_15,Ruined by Studio Interferences and a lack of clear direction.,2,21 October 2017,"I know my rating seems pretty harsh, and people do like this film. To me this films is bad, pretty bad, to the point where I was bored. This is a movie that tries to be fun, to make it seem better than Batman V Superman, but it clearly clashes with the tone it had before. I had a feeling that David Ayers, a fantastic director, tried to make this film similar to End of Days or Fury where it was occupied by great characters and solid action but overall built on these characters. However, the studio decided, hey, how about adding the most generic villain possible when a terrorist or the Joker (who is barely in this film as you might have guessed) would have been much better. There are definitely plot holes, to be expected, but some of them are too major to ignore. The whole Marvel scenario where the villain is destroying the city and the Avengers aren't helping is usually an idea that works because not only do they give proper reasons, in the universe it makes sense because of the amount of villains. No one quite understands the DC universe yet, and it is inferred that apocalyptic events don't happen to much, so I would imagine for example the Flash would try to stop the villain. However the writers decided the best excuse they could make as to why they didn't alert the superheroes is because ""they could turn on the citizens at any given point"". You've heard the criticism before, but why it bugs me so much is that there is hole scene devoted to it, a scene that tries to be stylized with in your face techniques that I am sure the studio put in after realizing the film wasn't ""fun"" enough. Now some will agree with me that there was a lot of meddling behind the scene but many say the fun action scenes and memorable characters make the film good. I feel like I watched a different movie, because many of the characters are terrible. The only three I liked where Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang (hopefully Jai Courtney has more good performances like this) and Harley Quinn. It is definitely strange why these three where in the film, but I can understand because they were by far the best characters, however excluding Harley Quinn they have almost zero development. The others where too forgettable, but I feel like for example the fire guy was going to be developed, but then the studio feared there wasn't enough action or Joker scenes. Every other character remains generic or just bad to me. Some liked Will Smith as Deadshot, but there are a couple of things that pull me back from liking him. 1. He feels like he his sleeping during half the film, not at his full potential 2. He is not at all like Deadshot, which I wouldn't mind too much if Deadshot wasn't such an interesting and great villain. I thought Jared Leto wasn't a good Joker, but to be fair there was far too little of him to tell. Honestly if they re-shot the film I would opt for less Joker and more character development. The action in the movie is way, way too bland. All it consist of is shoot enemy made of basically goo, turn to ash and rinse, repeat. There never feels like there is any stakes, and the dark look of the city never adds to the feeling of ""fun"" and just contrasts it. More bar scenes would make the film more bearable and entertaining, because some characters would work better explored. Finally the soundtrack is obnoxious, it never feels like it works for the moment, and it just feels like the studio trying to enforce a style that conflicts with the rest of the film. David Ayres wanted a character film with some action, but instead its got to be a Guardians of the Galaxy rip off, and the tones never blend together. Instead of being something unique suicide squad feels like a mish mash of clichés. It tries to tell you its unique, but never goes the full mile. Some characters are interesting enough and sometimes I like how it is shot, but for the most part this film is a mess, and by far the DCEU's worst film to date.",Suicide Squad

658,Abir-Xtreme,Sits somewhere between good and really bad,5,5 August 2016,"I went into this movie with rather high expectations, I was one of the peoples who appreciated BatmanVSuperman and felt it could boost DC into a good string of action films. Suicide squad was one of the movies first in line to this new-found momentum and it started out amazingly well. The opening is designed masterfully and you can see the effort put in to instantly grab the attention of the fans.Unfortunately, after that, everything falls flat on their face. Most of the side characters feel out of place and go through no real development. Which is a real shame because in terms of performance Margot Robbie really knocked it out of the park and Jared Leto held his own. If there was more consistent character development across the board and fewer plot holes coupled with a better story, then this could have been a movie many would love. The direction from David Ayer also deserves a fair amount of criticism as well as the camera work in any scene that does not sport action. Expect this to be very similar to BVS in terms of box office numbers but the opposite in slow appreciation. A decent flick that could have been way better",Suicide Squad
659,pschwebe,Sound and Fury. Signifying nothing.,3,7 August 2016,"A talented cast suffers from poor writing and poor directing. This is pure superhero porn: set action pieces stitched together with incoherent bits of plot. You have seen this all before, and better, in older movies. They make the ""good"" guys almost as bad as the ""bad"" guys. I suppose this makes the latter seem not so bad. And, like many superhero flicks, the writers seem to feel compelled to try to flesh out their characters, to make them more, what...relatable? It doesn't work very well here. Again, the screen writing is to blame. That said, there is some fun to be had. A few good lines. Jared Leto's take on the Joker is enjoyable. Otherwise, it's the usual thing.

There are only three characters worth watching in the film in certain scenes--the Joker, Harley Quinn and Deadshot; despite having an ensemble of talented actors. There are plenty of times when you wish the deafening violence to stop scattering your wits long enough to make sense of the convoluted plot. The scene of Harley Quinn reminiscing about her shared craziness (love?) for the Joker had a powerful effect on me. But the beauty of that short scene soon dissolved into the ugliness of punches and bullets; just like Quinn's sanity dissolved into that pool to give way to her insanity for the Joker. Will Smith is convincing in his role. All the other cast members seem ineffective, especially the Witch. There are numerous plot holes.

662,realmuthaf,Stale Squad,6,4 August 2016,"When I saw the first teaser-trailer and promo images for this movie, I was largely unimpressed. As the marketing campaign unfolded, though, Suicide Squad managed to create some serious hype that I found myself unable not to join. The result, however, is mixed, for the trailers advertise another, better, funkier and more audacious kind of movie.Story-wise, things are very simple and bland here - first we get around half an hour worth of character introduction (understandable, since there are so many of them), which goes at a rapid pace and with lots of different licensed background music, almost like an advertisement or a music video. Then, with everyone onboard, the Squad arrives to some city devastated by a colorful CG Aztec-looking big dude. What happens next is some of the more disappointingly stale stuff: instead of an explosive chemistry and wit-filled spectacle we get some uninventive action scenes involving shooting and beating lots of mindless drones (a-la Avengers 1&2), the supposedly ""bad to the bone"" protagonists implausibly bonding and becoming friends (they say that they're friends now, like, 5 times) and overcoming a lame bland CG-villain (who, despite all his powers and menacing looks goes down from a regular medium-sized bomb, yeah).Now the simplistic plot could have been saved by character interactions, but that doesn't really happen here. I'll just go ahead and list all the members with brief descriptions:Deadshot - Will Smith playing Will Smith. Nothing new, but it turns out I still like that guy.Harley - Margot Robbie is pretty and has a fine butt, but all the quirks and grimaces and the overall childlike demeanor at times feels out of place.Joker - This is a definite miss for me. Leto is overacting hard and is bringing nothing new to the table - he is just a mob boss who has a tendency towards ridiculousness.El Diablo - Surprisingly robust. The drama in his backstory didn't work for me, but overall he is fairly charismatic.Boomerang - Jai Courtney does not annoy the hell out of me in this movie, so that's some progress. Other than that, his presence is minimal and he mostly serves as a semi-successful comedic relief.Enchantress - From what I gather, Cara Delevigne is only somewhat famous because of her wealthy parents. Let's just say I wish this was not the case.Rick Flag and Amanda Waller - they play their respective parts well. Can't really add much.Killer Croc - He's alright, but I've got a feeling that nothing would've changed if he was not in this movie altogether.Katana - Read the paragraph above.Slipknot - Who?So, some of the chemistry between characters works, some of it doesn't. All of the drama in this movie is unconvincing and redundant. The Justice League cameos are pretty cool. The heavily-promoted soundtrack is underused, with the best songs just playing during the credits or muffled in the background (yeah, Purple Lamborghini).Overall I can't say it's a bad movie, but it's not a good one, either. It's just a tad bit above average, and it is sad, as this is yet another missed opportunity for the DCEU to get a solid hit on their hands.",Suicide Squad
663,dragonroars-57812,Power Rangers May Have Competition,3,10 January 2017,"It is a PG-13 movie so no horrific acts are allowed, just inferred like Saturday morning cartoons. The massive bad guy army is like the Power Ranger's bad guys. There are two scenes that are wtf moments and they are seen back to back. 1. Who is shooting the video of the main satellite getting blown up? 2. Who is filming (out in the ocean) the aircraft carrier being cut in half?Both these images appear on the military monitors at the Pentagon.Why did Capt. Boomerang (after knowing his micro explosive has been deactivated) return to the gang after he left? Also they missed a perfect opportunity to have a very comical scene where we see Capt. Boomerang's ""perfect desire"" instead they failed.I am not Marvel or DC fan base biased. Over all this movie is a poor attempt at cloning Marvel's Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy. But Deadpool was rated R for good reasons and Guardians of the Galaxy used actual script writers and not a team of monkeys from the zoo. DC is going to need a miracle to survive after this failure.Many of the ""squad"" members had no skill or just plain didn't do anything. Katana has no value and didn't do anything to make a difference. Capt. Boomerang was just present. Harley was a sex symbol and nice shots of her ass, I think she was suppose to be funny too. Killer Croc was also a back seat passenger to the end.Joker was featured in all the movie media and trailers, yet the joker barely shows up in the whole movie.

664,mad_man_moon,Her Heart's Not In It,2,8 August 2016,"Don't watch this film.Right, that said, here's what I attacked my arm with a sharpie with whilst watching this awful, awful, film. I have pictorial evidence of this which I'm happy to DM or something here, I was going to link to a tinypic, but that seemed a little dodgy. Here's what I 'memento'd' my arm with: intro ... actors ... Expoition ... A-Team intro ... pacing ... Enchantress Good ... not convincing ... violence too old / humour too young ... no drama for Joker despite good performance ... incomprehensible dark fight ... comic beats all miss ... ---censored quote from end of film--- ...So, three things up front: Firstly, because of how I wrote my arm comments, the reaction here will be mostly (but not obviously) chronologically based on what happened, but there are no spoilers here. Secondly, I've not exposed myself to hype or reaction to the film, so thoughts and feelings are my own, uninfluenced by media, social media, or friends. Then finally (related to number two) I go in to a film straight, meaning that even if I love the trailer I'll not go in thinking it'll be great. This works the other way, too ... I really found Sisters quite hilarious.OK, I've given my 'intro', so why not look at theirs ... theirs being the first, painful, forty minutes of a film this year, which basically boils down to ""The A-Team"". So, yeah, I'm not sure that I've seen more exposition so obviously spelled out for me on screen in years ... sometimes literally. But there's more expository nonsense that just keeps flooding, and flooding, your ears and eyes. I have a theory that if you remove 90% of the flashbacks you might have a shorter film buy the performances would actually have some subtlety to them. Harley's craziness would be ... CRAZY ... Joker's motivations (as I believe they should be) would be indecipherable ... Laton's few genuine emotions would be sold so hard. I do feel like this over usage of flashback (without overtly fetishising it for irony-lolz) is just more heavy literal thinking and expository pointlessness. The actors on show here can *perform* and most of that is lost if you spell out all of that to the viewer.That's probably the only issue with the performances, I think. They all seem to be doing a relatively good job with what was written the horrible pacing and structure just bury emotion, humour, and subtlety which basically kills any effective character development. Although I'll focus minutely on Robbie's performance which I just couldn't get anything from, I do put that down to editorial interference though, it just feels like your fringe friend that is pretending a little too hard. She does, though, like every other player, get given one decent emotional moment to sell (you'll know them when they come because of the massive sign on the screen saying ""BIG EMOTIONAL MOMENT""), and these are all handled well enough, but are completely buried by the overwrought stylings of the film.I guess that can nicely lead in to my one large positive from this complete mess of a film; Cara Delavigne's performance and most of the handling of The Enchantress in general. This said, I didn't feel that she was super threatening, but that's neither here nor there in this part of the analysis. The character really did fit the GRIMDARK aesthetic of the DC films thus far, and I think she'd have worked very well in any of the other properties that they have, so I'd like to see her kept around for when they get to magic in their Universe. I think the lack of threat probably came from it looking much like a weaker version of the planet smasher from MOS. Anyway, I digress, Delavigne is using those peepers perfectly, and really holds the screen and your thoughts well. It feels very much like the only decent, real, emotional, character building that happens, and when it does it's so sparse that I think that it's good that we got what we did out of it.Let's salute the GRIMDARK again, and take a quick snigger at the poor attempts to bring humour in to the fray. There is only one really good line that actually lands throughout the whole thing and it's Killer Croc that gets it. Otherwise the unfortunate literal nature of the film meant that I actually laughed more at one of Rick Flagg's last lines as an extremely helpful indicator of what was actually occurring for the characters... Tommy Wiseau level stuff. It's a sad time when you're laughing *at* a film rather than with it, it's sad because they could have cut some of the violence and aimed this solely at kids (it's a 15 in the UK) and lose some level of the 'bad guy' device, or ramp that up, and lose the Nickleodeon level ""humour."" So amongst the usual things that have plagued the Snyder films (he's EP on this, Ayer wrote and directed everything apart from a Boomerang Flashback) like the grimdark, the bad storytelling, the grimdark, the lack of humour, the gri... ... this just doesn't work on nearly every level. Poorly scripted, presented, directed, and ultimately this all ruining performances, it just all points to an unfortunate vision from Ayer.I'm actually lowering my score having read back what I'd written here, which puts it level with 'The Room' ... maybe I'll have a think about that.",Suicide Squad
665,MikialUK,Fun movie,8,27 August 2016,"The movie received many unnecessary over the top analysis from critics when in fact it's just a fun time movie. Why do they want to compare it to a serious Nolan movie. Or why not compare it to the Avengers. Almost same plot same villain resulting an expected ending. I suppose the jokes were flat at times but watching Will Smith & Margot in the same scenes was always a blast. They had extremely great chemistry. I'm really looking forward to seeing a sequel or a movie with Deadshot & Quinn. This is not to say that the rest of the cast were bad, but the contrary; they were fantastic. Sadly the script was not that great. On the other hand CGI were good too and the action was spot on. Watch it for fun.",Suicide Squad
666,tjsdomer2,"""A whole lotta pretty in a whole lot of crazy.""",6,4 August 2016,"The title of this review, like Harley Quinn, sums up Suicide Squad. Broken down in parts, Suicide Squad opens with a bang, meanders in the middle with the urgency of a root canal, and closes with another bang. The only problem with the closing bang is it comes in the form of one of Joker's gag guns. (Don't worry that's not a spoiler, just a metaphor.)The film gets quite a bit right in the backstory of the major characters, particularly Deadshot and Harley. These two characters, along with Diablo, are a strength of the movie throughout development-wise, played by Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandez. A problem with the other characters, save for a few Boomerang jokes, is their utility; at times they aren't given much to do and they seem like mere tagalongs without their own agency.Much will be made of Jared Leto's Joker, and I believe he does an OK job. At times he reminds me too much of the mob bosses in the comics he works so hard to upend, but Leto is a great actor and I think he will have much to add in future installments. I think one problem with him is that he was marketed so heavily, when the concentration on the plot should be on the Squad.Speaking of the plot...another weakness. I can't say I cared much for Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) rationale for having a bunch of crackpots lead a demolition squad, and the results are pretty predictable. The middle of the film is a bit awkward as far as team chemistry goes, even among Deadshot and Harley. Just when the film comes close to saying something profound, it reverts back to oddly-times jokes and head nods.In the end, this is probably DC's best attempt in the Extended Universe at something original and in general, even though it ends rather predictably. (A quick side note here is that I'm talking about original theatrical releases, since BvS Uncut is ultimately superior to this and I have reviewed that also.)2.5 out of 4 stars sounds about right.",Suicide Squad

But the strong points easily outweigh: Deadshot/Harley Quinn/team dynamic, and some great one- on-ones AND action Until the heavy CG end... Actually really enjoyed, not at the level of GOTG but different and exciting enough to easily warrant the spend. Kudos particularly to WS & MR - top performances.Think at outset Warners would have been pretty happy with this $ start, and if they get a hammering for large falls from now on, well isn't that the game now pretty much? Even supposed more 'respected' franchises like Bourne & Star Trek have suffered average starts/poor holds, but enjoyable nonetheless - and this will make a decent return. 'Bigger' teams like X-Men would kill for these figures! Overall a big win. And the Marketing guys deserve a raise! If there HAVE been issues with rushed production, maybe there ARE lessons to be learned, but overall - thanks Guys, enjoyed - bring on WW... and SS2...",Suicide Squad
668,keniwhat,Puerile and trashy intent but no redemption in the execution,2,11 August 2016,"A score of 7 here is one of the reasons I went to a movie I would normally skip. It was not rated for my 10-year-old so I had no real reason to go. The fact is I would let my 10-year-old see it but would still expect it to insult his intelligence. A cross between The Dirty Dozen and standard superhero fare the result is not as the makers probably intended. Suspension of disbelief is required in these Superhero films but the only disbelief I had to suspend was the that film direction could be so bad. The direction seems to have been to act as laconic as possible and the generated humour will carry a basically plot less movie through. Alas, this just results in overacting, creating annoying characters that seem written to appeal to boys in the range of 14-16, at the lower end of the IQ scale. Go if you want to see endless shots of Margo Robbie's behind as she walks away from a 'scene'. Or just go to Cheezers instead and buy yourself a beer, if that is your kind of thing.",Suicide Squad
669,Gorgorgorgoroth,Badly directed and awkward,1,14 August 2016,"1. The movie had too much music. They started playing a Black Sabbath song, then White Stripes, Queen, and then an Eminem song? How can anyone take a movie seriously when it has an Eminem song in it? Horrible choice of song! 2. A lot of the scenes tried too hard to be funny but came off awkward instead. Many times when Harley Quinn made a joke, it wasn't funny, I felt like cringing. Also, the ending where Killer Croc was watching a rap music video that showed girls twerking was just childishly stupid.3. No logic was in this movie. When the military was shooting Enchantress' minions, none of their bullets could kill them but somehow Deadshot and Harley Quinn could kill Enchantress' minions with their guns, as if their guns had some kind of special rounds or something. And the fact that Harley was able to kill Enchantress' minions by using a baseball bat was also dumb. When Deadshot found out Amanda Waller was in some kind of a safehouse, Amanda shot some people in that safehouse in cold blood. Everyone acted like it was nothing. Wtf? And when Harley Quinn was about to bow to Enchantress to trick Enchantress into thinking Harley would join her, Harley was reaching for a blade that was RIGHT between Harley and Enchantress and for some stupid reason, Enchantress was blind she didn't see Harley reaching for that blade! 4. I could not stand how they portrayed Katana. Of course, Hollywood only hires Asian actors if the Asian actors will play as these stereotypical characters like they're masters of martial arts/katanas and they hardly speak any English. The actress who played as Katana was an American but they made her speak Japanese most of the time. She probably had like one English line in that entire movie and she hardly spoke at all! Jesus this movie was better off without Katana! If you're going to portray a character in a racially stereotypical way, then don't have them in the fvcking movie! Overall, this movie's worse than Batman v Superman. At least BvS was much more serious of a movie than this pile of junk.",Suicide Squad
670,rachaelblakeegypt,Film made it likable,8,12 August 2016,"I liked the characters. This film made it likable. It provided a good introduction at the beginning of the film. I think anyone who sees this film will probably feel as though they did not get enough of all the characters but I also think that we got enough information to be introduced to to be interested in what those characters will do next.Going into this film I imagined a much darker film. Had it been more silent moments I would have been a much darker film.I felt invested in all the characters. I felt invested in all the characters somewhat emotionally.I liked how much Batman was in this film.I was really surprised that I was not more scared in this film. I was expecting to be scared of Joker in this film.I felt emotionally invested in each of the main characters due to their losses.Harley Quinn acted exactly how I imagined where her main devotion lied with Joker.Joker reminded me of pimp version of Mark Hamill's portrayal Joker but not as scary in this film.I loved the music from the songs to the score.I loved that we got to see hints to the Harley Quinn 1990's cartoon costume in this film.My problem was that the way the lines were said in the trailer gave a much more powerful emotional and comedic impression than I got while I was watching the film.I thought that the main villain was not big and dangerous for film.Once Enchantress turned into a belly dancer was a weird. It did not fit with the character who we had seen earlier in the film that was mysterious. One thing I did not understand about Enchantress was what she was doing with the portal. Why was the villain Enchantress were using a similar idea as seen in films like the first two Thor films, Spider-Man 2 or The Avengers by building something to destroy the world as we know it by means of a portal. The plan was never explained enough to understand what she was up.I liked #Diablo had a great story and felt bad because he killed family.The characters, relationships, and chemistry between the characters; are the best parts of the film.The flow to the film seemed a little off.The way that #Flash and Batman were utilized in this film I felt was adequately used to only introduce them to the stories of the villains back story. I did not need to see a lot of them. And this film used them the right amount.Will Smith as Deadshot was probably was the best part to the film.I was pleased with Harley Quinn's portrayal felt like the portrayal that I imagined her to be.Some of the feelings were not as strong enough as I had imaged to feel sad or cheer like I felt like when I watched the trailers.Some songs I did feel were a bit out of place because some of the music did not give me the emotional response it could have with no music or different music such as Deadshot trying to get #Diablo. It made some scenes anticlimactic.Some cuts made scenes predictable like showing Katana's samurai sword just before Harley Quinn stables #Enchantress and I thought that that should have been not shown until Enchantress was stabbed to show the surprise.I was expecting the bar scene to be much more powerful emotional and climatic scene than was presented in the film.The Joker and Harley Quinn was like a Bonny and Clyde relationship.I think we needed more Enchantress back story as a witch.I think that there was too many songs back to back and in some ways we needed them spread out with fewer songs so that we are cheering in excitement.I thought that the origin story to Harley Quinn was not strong enough emotionally. It could have been told better with different music.The ending to this film showed by #Diablo was so important to the team because he was very much underutilized in the scene.I loved #Katana in this film. There was enough mystery in the character where I found it interesting. I loved the story behind the sword and how the hair looked on her.Boomerang happened to be the character where we had no clue what kind of character he was or why he was even in the group at all.Amanda Waller was a character where you never felt quite sure if she was a good or bad character from the beginning even to the mid credit scene it made you question where she stood.This is a film where I would be interested in seeing another film like this with different villains. This films mid credits sequence hints to the Justice League.Source: http://www.megashare-viooz.net/suicide-squad-2016.html",Suicide Squad
671,tvsweeney-39052,"Too Much Chaos, Too Little Plot",8,30 January 2017,"I liked it but...There was too much detracting from what could've been a good story. Perhaps too many characters. When there's a large cast, it's difficult to give each player enough screen time so much of it had to be condensed into a few moments voice-over and a brief scene of his/her origin.They say you can't tell the layers without a program but in this one, even with the explanation of who everyone is, it's never clear why they're doing what they're doing. This is a movie in which the bad guys are bad and the good guys badder, but the so-called villains have their own set of morals while the good guys have none. (Naturally the ruthless are the ones in power.) While I liked the characters, the plot...was there really one? Since this was supposed to (apparently) be after the story in which Superman is killed, these characters are ""recruited"" to take his place. Having nowhere seen or heard of a movie about that event--did I miss it? Does it exist?--the viewers are subjected to a brief shot of a funeral cortege as explanation, and that's all.The plot is confusing. Muddled would be a kind way to describe it. It seems to go in one direction, then abruptly switch to another. The ""mission"" is said to be one thing, it quickly deteriorates into something else, though exactly what isn't clear, except that the Witch is involved. Adding to the confusion, there are flashbacks inserted in such a way they seem part of the action until they dissolve back into the present. Frankly, I'd liked to have seen more of the Joker. He seemed the most ""sane"" part of the story, and that's saying an ironic lot.While the various members of the suicide squad are good and the brief explanations of their backstories helpful, though Deadshot's is the only one explored in true depth, this movie was a disappointment because it seemed aimless, merely an excuse for explosive special effects and merely introducing characters, as if a ""trial run"" to see how audiences accepted them, perhaps in preparation for a movie with a true plot in which they again star.Score 8 stars for characterization; it would've been 10 if there had been some reason in all this chaos.This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",Suicide Squad

There is so much nit-picking just for the sake of it.This movie is great. I liked Dawn of Justice as well, but it could've been more exciting. However, this is way ahead in comparison. You get all the action, humor, cameos, and tight direction by David Ayer. Brilliant acting by the entire cast, especially Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Joel, Viola Davis and Jared Leto as the Joker.Please ignore the critics. As they say, haters gonna hate. This is one of the best DC movies till date. Go watch it.",Suicide Squad

CONS:weak or almost no story and has a lot of discrepancies, and does not make sense in a few scenes. A few characters are redundant, whether they exist or removed from movie it will have ZERO effect on the movie. movie time can be cut a lot lot shorter, so you expect many scenes are made up and do not add anything to the story.

Suicide Squad is a mess.The first act is very poorly edited. I chalk this up to lose foreshadowing for later on, and the director getting panned by WB to keep it PG-13. Rough jump shots occur to introduce characters that are somehow NOT introduced well, with the ensemble getting shafted to give Robbie and Smith the most screen time. The the initial premise is totally unbelievable; CIA operative trying to recruit the baddest of the bad to take down... Superman? Batman? JL? I'm not too sure, because Batman is part of the recruiting process in this. Predators has a more convincing plot than Suicide Squad. If the Suicide Squad is the ""contingency plan"" then why are they using Bats to get them and nixing their own agents? It's a huge WTF.Second half, the bad guys start bonding, and we get the rebel with a heart of gold syndrome. Problem is not all of them are on-board. Only two of them are remotely likable because the others have been snubbed for screen time, and it's hard to convince us one minute that Harley Quinn gives a sh*t and the next she wants to run off with Mista Jaaay. This goes into the third act as well until the finale.Third act has the least issues and I think this is what Ayer really had in mind; the villains cooperating to take on something bigger. Unfortunately, The Dragon in this movie, sucks. I won't spoil who it is, but come on. Screenwriters have got to start setting up villains properly over the course of multiple movies. One-shot-evil-just-because doesn't work. Not in Marvel, not in DC. If you disliked Whiplash in IM2, you won't be too keen on the real antagonist. (Also, why the weird dancing? If it's too recreate Santanico Pandemonium, try again.) I did kind of like Robbie in this, she's very attractive with her glasses on. But she was overall just annoying. And surprisingly, Hernandez and Jai Courtney for once are the most standout. The other (including Smith and Leto) are just bleh. Smith didn't play Deadshot. Smith played Will Smith. Killer Croc was a huge racial stereotype, Leto growled at people and acted like a weird drug lord (NOT an anarchist), and the other supporting cast were just not quite there. They actually decapitate a Native American guy (who can apparently climb anything) who's part of the Squad without introducing him! Move over NAACP, NCAI would like to talk with Warner.Lastly, the one liners. The effing one-liners! Stahp. My only theory is they were trying to recreate the magic from The Dark Knight trilogy and wound up somewhere around Batman & Robin.So yeah, not my CB movie of the year. Ayer has done better, and I suspect that WB (yet again) tied his hands. He has admitted that the character concept for Joker wasn't right. Hoping, but not holding my breathe for Affleck's Batman movie. But if MoS, BvS, and now SS are any indication, we may not be to far off from another re-re-reboot.",Suicide Squad
680,soneil12,Pretty decent superhero movie,7,25 October 2016,"First up I'm gonna say I'm a bit sick of superhero / comic adaptation films. They've dominated action films for a decade and I'm a bit over them.Having said that, I quite enjoyed this film. The characters were entertaining. Good action. Will Smith, Margo Robbie and Jared Leto were all superb in their roles. I thought the character of Amanda Waller was pretty good too though I found her level of ruthlessness was excessive and spoiled my enjoyment of that character a bit. Having known very little about the film before seeing it, I thought the cameos were a very nice treat.My one real complaint is that it all felt very rushed, especially in the earlier part of the film. As I was watching it there were many points where I felt that something had been cut that might have been better left in. I feel that a director's cut could very well be a lot more enjoyable than the version I saw in the cinema.",Suicide Squad
681,speedcanary,Entertaining,7,15 August 2016,"The film is about the formation of a radical team of antiheroes and how they unite in order to end an act of evil against the human race. The squad members face their own unique conflicts, which many of them face throughout the mission, and we see them bond and come together as a force to be reckoned with.Harley Quinn, as portrayed by Margot Robbie, is the breakout star. She did not disappoint. In fact, I would have liked to see more of her and her beloved puddin' Joker. A movie could easily be made chronicling their story together and that could be the Harley Quinn movie Margot wants. I'd love to see it! Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) was an instant favorite, but I would have loved to know more of his back story. Jai does an excellent job as playing a cooky, crazy thief, and I want to see more. El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) actually was a character I found most relatable. There is symbolism within him and his inner rage destroying those he loves the most. He was able to redeem himself in the end.Underutilized Killer Croc and Slipknot almost didn't matter. They were there in order to advance plot. Slipknot was used as an example of what would happen if the squad disobeyed Flag or Waller. I also didn't see the need for Katana. It's a shame she felt just thrown in so they'd have another cool female.I loved Viola Davis' portrayal as Amanda Waller. I couldn't have asked for more. I feel quite similarly about Joel's Flag. He is such a complex character that commands the screen. I would have liked more back story on Flag so I could have connected a bit more to him in the end. I feel the same way about Deadshot (Will Smith). More back story. The snippets with his daughter were nice, but more about what led him to become the killer he is would have helped.The tone of the film was surprisingly light hearted and comical juxtaposed against the darker, more sinister setting. I loved the coloring and lighting in the film- it was just right and gave it a comic book feel.The enemies in the film were two-fold. The Squad had to deal with ARGUS AND Enchantress. I feel that due to their success in defeating the latter, it helped them to advance their relations with the former a bit better. The person that voiced Enchantress really made the character for me. That voice made her convincing, whereas her appearance didn't really frighten me.Overall, I found SUICIDE SQUAD to be entertaining, fun, and funny. I would like to see more, or at the very least, A Harley Quinn film.",Suicide Squad

I guess it's a tough task to get them all equal screen time. My suggestion would have been to cut back on the members. Problem solved.It doesn't quite have the fun of the trailer, which can happen when someone not involved with film cuts something that may not represent the film.Harley Quinn obviously a stand out, but the BIG ONE for me, was seeing Batman, albeit briefly. Just enough to tantalize. Wetted my appetite for his solo film which can't come soon enough.",Suicide Squad
683,cammymadden,Possibly the Most Average Film EVER!,4,9 October 2016,"With films such as this, there is often the risk of expectations being too high before the film is even released, ultimately resulting in the film being disappointing when it doesn't live up to all the hype that was generated. Luckily, this film had Man of Steel and Batman V Superman to kill everybody's hopes for it being any better than these. As more trailers were released, we got to see the characters and ultimately the ""Suicide Squad"" were painted as this group of villains who would be blackmailed into doing some good at threat of having their heads blown off. In an attempt to keep this review spoiler free (something I tend not to bother doing with other reviews) all I will say in relation to the storyline is that we're not dealing with villains and despite the constant misuse of the term ""sociopath"" which gets thrown around like a hot potato, these ""villains"" unfortunately fall victim to the biggest threat of all: Hollywood clichés. This film works if you're half asleep, don't need any real storyline or interesting character development, or really anything that makes sense in any way. If you're looking for an original film (especially a comic book film) then I'd advise searching elsewhere because it's not this film. Much like Deadpool, despite everyone claiming on the run up to release that this film would break the boundaries of what we consider the ""superhero franchise"", it (much like Deadpool) ends up being EXACTLY like your basic, most typical comic book film ever! Back when The Dark Knight Trilogy was fresh on our minds I always considered the Marvel vs DC debate to be fairly balanced, maybe even tipped more towards DC but certainly in terms of films, Marvel is now so far ahead that even The Flash would have a hard time catching up. DC are seriously going to have to rethink their approach to films if they want to stay relevant.",Suicide Squad

When I first came to know about this group, it had something which made it different from Avengers or Justice League or any other Suphero group. It was made by all villains, or we can say negative character. But the movie just made everyone so good. They were supposed to be the villains.
The film started pretty good, but then it all fades away. Some point of the movie doesnt even make sense. I think i am expecting pretty much from DC, after Dark Knight Triology.

685,TanQ,A Worthy Rival to Catwoman,4,10 August 2016,"This wannabe blockbuster will leave you feeling pretty neutral. They do the most boring thing possible to introduce the characters, they give you small flashbacks and talk about them all to typically cliché ridden rock songs. The end result? you really don't care about any of them. They're supposed to be bad guys but the worst you see them do is steal a purse. Strangely, that was one of the highlights of the film. So the story can pretty much be summed up in 10 words: Criminals are let out of prison to stop a villain. There, I just saved you $15. 90% of the cast is disposable, they fight some terribly rendered, faceless lump heads then fight some guy that I swear was in Tron from the 80's. There's really not much to say about the film because that's pretty much it. While sitting through the first half hour of introductions and talking I had to lean over to the person next to me and ask if I'd missed the six more interesting movies that should've preceded this hot mess. No, she replied. It's too bad, some of them looked like they may be slightly more interesting than what I was watching. There was really nothing remarkable about this piece of fluff. It seems to be designed for 14-year- old boys who haven't ever read an actual book or seen any decent films. At one point in the movie they actually gave us a flashback of an event that happened only 20-minutes earlier, and not to introduce new information but to just reiterate something that was bad enough viewing once. At the end of the movie, I felt more intrigued by the buttons that moved my seat back and forth than by anything I'd seen. Hopefully this will end the vacuous reign of Zac Snyder and comic book movies. If it doesn't, then maybe they just need to hear that comic book movies are only a step above video game movies. Give us a story that doesn't rely on the protagonists standing around the bad guy in a rough circle while hitting them.",Suicide Squad

I'm not one to give exaggerated scores, but when i give this a 1/10 i do it from the bottom of my heart! Is there a single department where this movie doesnt fail? Lets see...Directing and cinematography: boring and half of the time its too dark to see whats going on (but thankfully we got to see a sky beam for the 450th time) (than one scene with Enchantress was the only nice one in the movie)Acting: mediocre at best (noone stands out). But don't worry about it cause Leto sent rats to his co-starsCostume design: horrible. Especially Harley Quinn looks like a stripperCGI: hilariously bad (especially at the fight scene where El Diablo turns into a fire monster and in every scene where
Enchantresses brother is in, it's so bad it hurts)Plot: Horrible at best, extremely predictable
and makes zero sense. Honestly it doesn't make sense even for superheroe movie standards (heroes like Batman or Flash are absent in a world ending threat despite appearing in the movie, Waller thinks a girls with a bat, a guy with guns, a crocodile, a guy with a boomerang, a guy who shoots fire and a guy who can climb stuff can go toe to toe witha superman level threat, the mindless goons they fight can *take 2 headshots and keep fighting* but all die with one headshot, an archaeologist deliberately breaks an artifact thousand years old, batman ambushes deadshot while he's with his kid and on and on the list won't stop)Characters: not only are they horrible, i don't care about them at the slightest since the only thing i know about them is a minute long flashback of them. Slipknot is there for a combined 2 minutes before dying and Katana is thrown in without any explanation or even backstory for most of the movie (but we do know that her blade captures the souls of her victims). Harley Quinn is also annoying at best and Deadshot is just Will Smith. The Joker is horrible, acts as if he's disabled and is a cringy laughing stock who is one tattoo away from cosplaying Lil Peep. The rest aren't even worth mentioning . Also the villain is laughable since she straight up belly dances through the entire movie and her entire motivation is she's evil.Humour: non-existent. Harley Quinns attempts at it made me roll my eyes so far back i didn't even know it was possible.Action: laughable. Just laughable. Not a single decent action scene. (Half of them weren't even clearly visible)Score: one of the worst ones I've ever heard of. An incoherent mess that uses songs from a plethora of genres, that dont fit at all with the movie or with one another.

It can be seen that Warner wants to create the dc universe to Marvel against the heart. The clown girl was so well played by Robbit that everyone was attracted to her. I'm looking forward to the clown girl's personal movie .,Suicide Squad
688,gordonm888,Suicide Squad creates characters I want to see again.,8,19 August 2016,"I don't understand all the negative reviews on this site. Suicide Squad provided a pretty standard roller coast ride for an action movie, but it was fun and interesting. Most of all, it created (and introduced me to)characters that both my wife and I want to see again in another movie.Top Tier of new DC Movie Characters: Deadshot and Harley Quinn were both extremely interesting -for different reasons. We would pay to see any movies in the theater that has either of these characters in it -even solo movies.Excellent ""Ensemble-type"" characters: We enjoyed Killer Croc, Katana, Amanda Waller and Diablo. Killer Croc is a ""Thing-like"" who probably benefited from not being on the screen continuously for long periods of time. Katana was intriguing but didn't speak much or show as much personality as others -we liked her though and want to see more. Diablo's internal struggles and meta-human skills were interesting. Amanda Waller was impressive as one tough cookie - a female Nick Fury who is far more 'morally-ambiguous"" than Fury. Viola Davis looked the part as Amanda and did a reasonable job with her.Rick Flag: He was okay but nothing special. We have seen characters like him hundreds of times before in movies - like, for example, in every Bruce Willis movie ever made.Captain Boomerang: This character was 'meh' for me. He seemed very weak in the fight scenes, his personality was not interesting and his spoken lines were hard to understand.Enchantress had overly strong powers that seemed to lack any rules or boundaries - not a good combination. However, her backstory was good and she was visually interesting -and her human alter-ego inspired sympathy.Joker by Jared Leto is not a new DC Movie character, but he was very menacing and well-done. Nice job.Given that Suicide Squad creates new character 'assets' for future DC Movies, I think it was a strong success.",Suicide Squad
689,thefilmguy7,DC on life support,6,4 August 2016,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. The trailers and advertising was so good that it was impossible to not feel some hype. I'm also a big DC universe fan and really wanted to see them finally find some footing. Sadly this movie was a let down. The first act is all one giant spoon fed exposition as we have only a few of the casts backstories jammed down our throats. The rest of them are left one dimensional and they never feel more real than cartoons. A good film doesn't need to spend so much time shoveling out exposition. Look at Guardians Of The Galaxy. That movie just did such a great job creating rich characters, each earning their time on screen, who's chemistry with each other was electric that you got everything that you needed to know about them.Will Smith is great at playing Will Smith. He's as charismatic as ever and definitely adds some fun moments. However he is NOT Deadshot and portrays the character far more as a redeemable hero than he is meant to be. Margot Robbie is every bit as good as we all hoped. She's one of the few things that the movie totally delivers on. Jared Leto as Joker ... where oh where did you go wrong? This is the first cinematic version of the character that falls flat. He brings nothing memorable or interesting to the character. With how much he was hyped, with his method acting and claims about how terrifying he was on set, I definitely expected more. True his screen time is minimal but the second you saw the other Jokers that's all you needed to know that they were iconic. This Joker just wasn't. I mean he wasn't bad but he fell into that just barely serviceable category which is extra disappointing in a way. I expected so much more from him and now I'm very unenthusiastic of him appearing in future films. Jai Courtney is fun but under used. I kept forgetting that Killer Croc was in this movie. The rest of the cast does OK with what little they have. The threat in the film is way too supernatural and cartoony to fit the gritty dark world surrounding it. It's amazing how many possibilities they could have taken with villains and that this was the best they could do is pretty baffling. The action has it's moments but is also pretty repetitive at times. Sure there was some key moments that I enjoyed. It's just as a whole the movie was a let down. The cameos were fun I guess. The music was solid but the movie some times felt like a giant advertisement to buy the soundtrack with how often songs were forced in. All in all it's just another brick in the wall. Uninspired and unmemorable. It's not going to do much to help establish the DCEU. They really need Wonder Woman to be something special to pull this series out of this state of just being ""OK"". They need to be great next time.",Suicide Squad
690,bradencn,"Dry and Scripted, TBH",4,6 August 2016,"Before you hate me, hear me out: this movie wasn't necessarily bad: it just wasn't good. It definitely did not meet expectations, and people that don't admit that are quite sincerely kidding themselves.Listen: the show is so scripted and you can just hear it in every, single, scene. Sure, it's cutesy and funny, you laugh here and there, but even more so, you face palm yourself because it all sounds like it was written two days ago, filmed yesterday, and released today. Really, it sounds like that. The script is terrible, well, either that or the director executes the script very poorly on screen.In addition, the plot. Oh, the plot. So interesting: it is so predictable at parts, but then so flat out confusing at others that it is hard to feel emotionally connected to it. It's tough when the whole time you are squinting trying to understand exactly how everything is connected.The back stories of the characters, I mean, they tried. But, to be honest, it wasn't motivating. Harley Quinn, who was supposed to be the most BA character in the whole movie, who basically was the key marketing item in the film (yes, even bigger than Deadshot), was weak! This is NOT a spoiler when I say she really wasn't all that intimidating. They tried, but I wasn't convinced.Will Smith does go through his role well. He deserves the most credit. Other characters, though? Ugh...that's just how I felt. Listen: they rushed this, folks. I'm serious. This film was rushed and you felt it the whole time. Basically zero character development, jokes that basically fall flat, and a waste of talent in actors. I'm excited for other DC movies to come out, still, but this one is not going to be their golden child, let me tell you.Like I said, don't be a hater, but, c'mon, you have to admit this wasn't that good.",Suicide Squad
691,rohonnag,"Not the best, but Sort of enjoyable...",5,5 August 2016,"This movie has SUPER low ratings on Rotten tomatoes and the reviews make this sound the WORST comic book movie EVER made! This movie follows a bunch of super villains who are press ganged into working for US Government and work as its on the ground assets. After Superman is gone, they don't have a first response team and they decide to use these expendable criminals for the job.I have NO idea why this movie is facing such a huge critical backlash. Articles calling it the worst movie ever made etc etc is just over the top and meaningless. It would be safe to say, the critics got it wrong this time.How cool is it to see the flashbacks of these villains and heroes like Batman and the Flash apprehending some of them! the start is pretty good, it almost like a proper comic book where you have small cameos of other heroes randomly without making it a big deal...The positives in the movie are Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. They both absolutely shine in this movie. Surprising, when it comes to performances, Jai Courtney as Captain boomerang was pretty good! This guy is usually REALLY bad in movies such as Terminator Genysis but somehow he was pretty good in this movie. other actors do a decent enough job, but nothing worth a mention. The score / music track is a mixed bag with a lot of 90's hits being played at random times.Now we come to negatives. It might seem like I am listing a LOT of them, but seeing the movie, somehow it not all that glaring.1. Joker. This Joker s just PLAIN bad. Like a 0/10. Seen better performances in a C Grade film. This is hands down the worst joker EVER committed to film, this included the 1966 version. The first scene with him and Harley in a strip joint is just cringe worthy and it doesn't look like the director actually made that scene, it seems like a bad add on. His Ha ha ha was SO bad, I wanted to shut my ears and shout at him to shut the HELL up. Which moron came up with this joker ?2. The editing. What wrong with WB movies? Same as batman V superman, the editing in this ALL over the place. But thankfully unlike BvS, this movie isn't complex and nuanced and hence the bad editing doesn't hurt it so badly. For example, there is a night scene, then suddenly without any kind of transition, it's a day scene. It jarring and surprising to see such a bad edit in a big studio movie.3. The Villain. Hands down the WORST villain ever done in a big budget movie including the fart cloud in Green Lantern. The villain (Spoilers- Minor) is Enchantress and even tho is 100% smoking HOT, she can't act at all. She is literally dancing in one major villainous scene. I don't mean this figuratively, she is grooving like Micheal Jackson in BAD. WHO THE HELL came up with that crap ? What was his villainous plan ? GOD knows, it was stupid and badly done.4. The direction. WB movies are all suffering from this. This is just badly directed or maybe just cut bad in the edit. The movie is good only because the performances are VERY strong. But they didn't get the feel of a city in danger or people dying, evacuation, nothing was done right. Wish it had more time to setup the city and what was at stake.Despite all this, the movie is not bad or UN-watchable. It's a simple plot with not many twists and its easy to keep up despite the disjointed edits and bad direction.Overall its worth a watch for comic book fans IF you are not expecting a master piece.Rating : 5.5/10 . Definitely NOT as bad as the critics are saying, its watchable and at times fun!",Suicide Squad
692,CraigsCritique,With DC Laughing All the Way to the Bank...Is the Joke on Us?,6,9 August 2016,"I tried my best not to get hyped up over the prospect of Suicide Squad, I better than anyone should know that a great trailer doesn't equal a great film & unfortunately that statement is true to a degree.I think the missed potential of the film is what is killing it with the overall negative professional critic reaction I'm witnessing currently, it's going to truly bring the money in there's no doubt about that, but what I worry about is the fact that this should have been the film to truly kick-start the critical favourability of a DC film property, yet my own personal take on Suicide Squad is that although it certainly isn't the absolute disaster many critics would have you believe it is, yes it's fun to a point but also misguided & messy in equal measure, so it isn't particularly anything to shout home about, simply put there's stuff to like & other stuff to be frustrated by.So what is there to like? Well firstly a couple of the performances, Will Smith as Deadshot works extremely well if some of his plotted history is a bit on the nose, Margot Robbie certainly makes an impression as the truly troubled Harley Quinn & her bow the Joker played here by Jared Leto in what can unquestionable be described as an extended cameo plotting and hinting at their personal history prior to this film including a gangster style takeover of Gotham (which is in part one of the main problems of the film because I instantly wanted to see that film) a rather surprisingly funny performance came from an actor I have previously derided in the likes of A Good Day to Die Hard and Terminator: Genisys, that actor is of course Jai Courtney playing a character called Captain Boomerang who is probably the most human member of this super-team of bad guys, his wisecracking should have been really annoying & hey it may be to some but I thought it worked rather well.Another rather great positive was the actual look and feel of the film, so it did feel like a murky world these villains inhabited and my word did they get the costuming spot on, great stuff from that point of view.It is however inevitable that with a Squad this size there are going to be characters who are completely overlooked or not given any kind of effective use on screen, so principally the characters of Killer Croc & Katana are no doubt interesting but given hardly anything to do and kind of seem there to make up the numbers. On a completely other note the character of Rick Flag played here by Joel Kinnaman is just way too damn boring considering he's leading a team of truly fascinating villains to have any effect on the film and you really do forget he's there sometimes.Now lets delve into the many layers of the Enchantress character played by Cara Delevingne who eventually become the villainess of the piece although initially it would appear she may be another member of the team, there are kind of three stages to her character & therefore performance, one is inconsequential and merely a steppingstone, one is truly fascinating and is just interesting purely on a stylistic level but also on what her character is able to do in this form yet is quickly pushed aside for them to get to the final stage of her character who in my opinion kind of loses any threat level the moment she starts speaking (sorry but the voice for her was almost laughable considering she's supposed to be incredibly threatening) I also had memories of the villainess of Zuul from the original Ghostbusters film flying around inside my mind as she was performing.The way also that the plot tends to just plod along without any gusto was a bit concerning and it seems to be playing some particular usual cinematic plotting tropes, going through the motions some may say, one moment has the team coming together in a vain of Guardians of the Galaxy only with less awesomeness as it does feel slightly forced.There's heavy influences of particular to John Carpenter films with Escape From New York being without doubt a model for the story's structure/plotting and style, well criminals being sent to rescue an individual of high 9mportance...need I say more on than aspect? When it finally comes down to the action set pieces it's surprisingly average and plot serving to a point which is a shame given to array of characters at their disposal and there's a legion of literally faceless bad guys for them to machine-gun down as utter bullet fodder.So it would appear I'm extremely critical of an awful lot of what the film involves but yet there's still certainly a good amount to intrigue and keep your interest even if not everything works throughout.It's a complete mixed bag of a film with plenty to frustrate yet then also like and intrigue you and there's no doubt in the fact that this is certainly a film that is placed in a more unique place in our cinematic world right now and that alone makes it worth seeing.",Suicide Squad
693,jackson-regurge,Don't listen to the critics!,7,7 August 2016,"First thing first: don't listen to the critics! Suicide Squad is a really fantastic and well rounded film. The film is thoroughly entertaining and does not disappoint. It has some really impressive action sequences and the writing combines a perfect blend of seriousness and humour. Jared Leto has completely nailed the Joker! The only real problem is that we don't get enough of him. Leto's performance is unlike any Joker we have seen before, acting as more of a crime lord. This is an inspired version of the Joker, one of which I am absolutely desperate to see come up against Ben Affleck's Batman. Harley Quinn portrayed by Margot Robbie is also something I have been waiting to see for a long time. She is the ultimate female bad-ass and at times really steals the whole show. When Harley is on screen with the Joker, magic happens and it is a welcome addition to the cinema screen. I can't wait to see more of this criminal couple. Other characters which are of note are Deadshot who is excellently played by Will Smith and Diablo who is played by Jay Hernandez. These two characters are truly brought to life by these great actors. The film lacks a little something in the antagonist department (a slight irony) but this does not bring the film down as there are such strong characters portrayed by such great actors/actresses. I would have personally loved to have seen Joker as the main antagonist. However, I can respect the choice made. Overall, I think David Ayer did a really fantastic job of bringing this team of colourful characters together. I would give Suicide Squad 7 out of 10 for its bold new take on the superhero genre.",Suicide Squad
694,constanza-nm,It could've been awesome,5,27 March 2017,"I'm right in the middle with this one. It's not a terrible awful movie but is definitely not excellent. There are thousands or reviews about it, so I'm gonna keep this one short.WATCH THE EXTENDED CUT. Yep, if you haven't seen it yet and you're curious about it, watch the extended cut. Still has issues BUT has better character development, more interesting interactions and the added scenes help to create a better pace (one of the main problems, in my opinion, with the original theatrical version).In the end, I think the biggest problem with this film is how cool it looked in the trailers, and how dumb is the actual plot. But thanks to the performances I actually enjoyed it. Give it a try. I think in the end we all agree on one thing, It could've been awesome. (we cannot trust DC)",Suicide Squad

700,AdamDroge,It's really not that bad,8,5 August 2016,"I don't want to go into too much detail in this specific post, but I do want to make a stand here on IMDb that this movie isn't as bad as the critics are making it out to be. A score that's below 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes? Ouch! That's not a fair score for this movie.It's worth noting that most of my life I have been a huge fan of DC. And that's why I've been disappointed with the DC Cinematic universe so far. Man of Steel was a disaster and Batman v. Superman tried to do too much in one movie. Suicide Squad is lighter in tone, has a more simple premise, is a more focused movie, and is a ton of fun.Margot Robbie is as good as everyone's been saying. And Jared Leto kills it as the Joker, even though he isn't given much screen time. These two make a psychotically wonderful on-screen villain couple that I loved. Will Smith's Deadshot was also fantastic as he brings a lot of heart and charisma to the character with his backstory.I was also a fan of Captain Boomerang, Diablo, Killer Croc, and Enchantress even if they aren't quite on the same level as the other three villains. They're still good, though. I love the team dynamic. I love the idea of the suicide squad. Being that they're all villains, you never really know what they are going to do or if one of them is going to betray the team. In my opinion, an all-villain team has potential to be much more interesting than an all-hero team because you don't know who to root for or what's going to happen and this movie does a great job at that.The soundtrack was a bit much at times and the editing wasn't always super sharp. And no, there's no moment that really blows you away and there's no crazy twists or turns. But this is a really fun movie that's done well. It was my most anticipated movie of the year going in and even though it doesn't reach the heights I was hoping and thinking it would, it's still a lot better than many critics have made it out to be and is a huge step forward for DC that proves to me that their future is bright. My grade for the movie is an 8/10.If you do want to see a more in depth review from me, I just typed that up on my movie blog and thus you can go to this link right here to read more: http://drogemiester.blogspot.com/2016/08/suicide- squad-review.html",Suicide Squad
701,AussieMovieReviews,A good soundtrack trying to cover a messy script.,6,20 August 2016,"6/10. A film based on a DC Comic in which we see a group of criminals recruited to take down what no normal person can. Off the bat I would recommend the soundtrack, although a lot of very cool songs put together to try and improve on a messy script and story. Directer David Ayer does quite a good job of showing you and introducing you to who the suicide squad are, but doesn't seem to know what to do with them after that. Will Smith as Deadshot does a fine job as expected by him. Jared Leto is an effective Joker, I actually liked his manner and was creeped out by his laugh, unfortunately he is only a side character and not the big bad. But Margot Robbie steals the show as Harley Quinn, with a superb job. The origin story of how she came about was one of the better parts of the film. Action was OK but a bit lacking. The villain was just boring and didn't seem to have any purpose. Overall a little disappointed but some good acting and a few good scenes pushed this to a 6, which means it was better than BVS, but only just. I really hope DC pulls their socks up.

702,Fiurilli,A forgetful super hero movie,3,5 August 2016,"Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and others star in Suicide Squad, the latest movie by writer/director David Ayer. The movie has us follow a group of bad guys who are forced to work together and defeat other evil incarnations. It is however not in their nature to team up, but they are forced to with a remote controlled explosive device that is planted into their neck, if they do not follow their orders the device is activated and they die. Not obeying their leader would be equal to committing suicide, hence the name Suicide Squad.In the first hour of the movie all the different characters are introduced. This does not work all that well however as it is very hard to become invested in a character when all you know about them is information that other characters say trough expositional dialogue. Not all characters get a proper introduction however as some are just shoved in there. One of the characters is only introduced with a simple line of dialogue for example. The introductions, though lengthy, really do not provide a lot of background and when the movie wants you to care about them more it throws in a simple flashback.The actors portraying the different characters overall did a great job. Sometimes the performances felt a bit off, but I got the impression that the movies director was more to blame for this. This is especially true for Jared Leto's character 'The Joker' who felt more like a simple thug with a mental disorder rather than the bad-ass mobster he should have been. The movies main villains felt a little bit overpowered (which forced them to not use their power to their full extent when fighting the Suicide Squad) but the action sequences between them and the Suicide Squad were all fairly well done. There are a few moments where slow motion is lazily used to create a bit more tension but never enough that it becomes a major problem. There isn't really an action scene so good that you'll remember it in a few years time though, but on the other hand there also isn't one so bad that'll accomplish the same either. In the end 'Suicide Squad' works fine as a brainless action movie and fans of the characters will certainly enjoy it to some extent. People who do not know the characters will probably enjoy it a lot less though as the movie never establishes a good connection between them and the viewer and for a movie that should be just about the Suicide Squad themselves this is a major flaw.My rating: 4/10",Suicide Squad
703,npfares,A horrible Mess,1,24 August 2018,"I honestly don't get it. I really don't. Where are all the high ratings coming from? Is it from 12 year old boys who say 'oooooo, look I saw Margot Robbie with her shirt off and saw her bra.'? Maybe trolls who don't care about content but just want 'action, action, action' because it's the only movie they see this year, and 'oh by the way, I saw Margot Robbie with her shirt off. HeHe'? There was hardly any character development, the characters portrayed in this movie didn't really reflect their characters in the comics, The Joker was portrayed as some type of Rapper type gangster (which isn't the character. The Joker isn't a white Rapper wannabe Gangster. He is a seriously disturbed character who has very serious mental health issues who people can say 'in a certain twisted way yeah! I get the logic'). Will Smith plays too much of a 'nice guy' type of character in which his character wasn't really that 'nice of a guy'. On top of that we find Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn. A Character that is suppose to be unrealisticly 'in love' with the Joker. But all we get is 'oh, how cute! They have a misunderstood love that the public doesn't understand' type of character arch.

704,malcydon,"Mixed feelings, Superhero genre",8,14 August 2016,"The film is between brilliance and a giant disaster. Before you go to watch it, really think about whether you want to watch it.First of all: The Enjoyment. The first 30-40 minute is pure sleep. The character introductions are good, but the plot and explaining is BORING and horrible. A lot just gone out to get some snacks. The middle part is well-done, it pulls your tension and things go more serious, interesting. Characters really show off, the trailer Joker+Harley is here. The end is very good. I really enjoyed as things clipped together, BECAUSE of the characters. Not plot or anything else. The actors really carried this movie.The plot. The plot is non-existent, gibberish. You can see it in the first part that it barely makes sense and nothing gets together. At all. It's pure mistake. The middle part proves this a 100%. It's not going to make sense, it's stupid and the writer or producer really - really - wronged this.The characters. Awesome. Loved them all. They all performed a 120%. The main act is carried by Will Smith(dead shot) and Jay Hernandez(The Satan - IMDb text filter) whom out-performed themselves. They were really good. The sideline is strongly carried by Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Jared Leto (Joker). The rest of the characters are without purpose. Their whole existence is a mistake in adaptation for either the animation or the comics. As such I can't say anything of whether are good or not, because they are just there. In comparison for the above, they don't have anything to do. Amanda Waller character (played by Viola Davis) was also really good.The cinematic. Awesome. The way the guys made this ~~ were really awesome. The scenes felt good, the slow-motion and lights brilliant. The cutting however was bad. The lightning also bad from time to time.I think as an adaptation.. this movie fails.

I liked how they are all fighting like they're the avengers in all of the fights. That is actually what it reminded me of a little bit ,the 2012 avengers movie. There were a group of individuals fighting an army of unknown creatures together. Although,it wasn't giving a good cooperation so much,it was still giving a little bit of team work. I have to be honest with this,I wasn't a big fan of the joker's look,but I liked everything the joker would be doing. I loved Harley Quinn and what she did,but not the look. I love her old fashioned look better. I love Deadshot,that's not changing. I never really knew about killer Croc a lot or Diablo or Kitana. I knew about Captain boomerang and he was funny. I was actually surprised to see the a few unexpected guests,except for Batman. I knew he was in it,because of the trailer,and plus these are mostly his villains too. So it would make sense to put him in it. I also didn't know about Enchantress that much either. I just knew she was in the movie,but they didn't show her much in the movie.

She explains how they have contingency plans for everything, like Nukes and Anthrax and mentions that we put ""fluoride in the water.""Come on, Amanda. Everyone knows fluoridation is a communist plot to destroy our precious fluids.Let's talk about the joker! They really blew him up in the promotions for this movie. You'd think he'd actually have kind of significance in the plot. No.He shows up in a helicopter to save Harley Quinn from captivity. The helicopter is immediately shot down. She promptly returns to the group to finish the mission. That's it. That's Joker's role in this movie. No contribution to the story, just a shameless cameo to serve as filler.Maybe this movie is supposed to be a collection of really bad Kubrick homages?

It's painfully obvious that the whole film is a promotion project for itself, a nonsense-trip with an attitude. If you care... about anything really: Talk to the hand.

Some of these are pretty good in their own right. Kind of music clip like. And indeed: The score makes its point accurately. Half the characters are fillers, as if to make it feel more random, chaotic and brightly colourful.

711,mounirrmaged,One of the worst blockbuster movies i have ever experienced.,1,10 April 2017,"Suicide squad is the third entry in the DCEU franchise. After the extremely divisive film that was batman v superman, fans had high hopes in this film that it will save DC, having much potential. Unfortunately, it was terrible. The film focuses on a group of villains: Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, El Diablo and Katana in which they must save the world. The film had several re-shoots obviously, as the film at first was supposed to be a dark, gritty film. But the changes ended up more like guardians of the galaxy, with its more colorful changes and witty dialogue. The film is absolutely terrible, giving so little for the characters to work with. Harley Quinn for example, isn't given much aside from her witty, cringe worthy quips and lunatic behavior. Most of the other members are also given very little that is not expanded enough to have any sort of interest. It feels manipulative when it tries to develop these characters. It gives you a small fraction of its backstory and thinks it will be enough to get some emotional investment. It is done so poorly and lazily that its laughable. The opening scene where the film introduces the characters is done terribly, where Amanda Waller is there to throw exposition for the characters, with the flashy texts next to the characters. It ends up feeling rushed and not giving the time it needs. With that said, Harley Quinn and Captain boomerang are fun to watch. While they don't have much to work with, Jai Courtney and Harley Quinn's performances make these characters enjoyable to watch. However the way they treat the joker here is just insulting, giving him less than 15 minutes of appearance and having very little impact on the story was completely unnecessary. He wasn't supposed to be in the movie like this. The film's story doesn't add up. So in the film, Amanda Waller hires these criminals to combat meta-humans, but it doesn't explain why these criminals, who aren't trustworthy. Why not call upon the heroes like wonder woman or batman? It just doesn't add up. The funny thing is that the backstory of these characters, especially Harley Quinn with the joker, would have made a much more interesting film and much more engaging. One other aspect is the directing of the film, which is extremely broken. It can't even do the most basic of film making, having clumsy editing with its flashy lighting when it introduces the characters, the colorful texts that are there to give exposition, the pop songs that feel completely out of place. It doesn't build a moment or give any sort of emotion. Just a pop song thrown there and there. The action scenes are also terribly directed, with its dark lighting that doesn't give a clear sight what's going on, and the cut that makes it hard to follow. It's so broken that it leaves plot holes and continuity errors, to the point where it doesn't even feel like an actual movie. The scenes of the film are disjointed, and making the experience much more painful. This choppy editing, lighting and pop music leads to an inconsistent tone. It doesn't know if it wants to be a dark, gritty emotional film, or a fun witty film with funny mischievous protagonists. it's unfocused and it ends up being confusing. The film is also needlessly dark in its lighting. It makes the film visually assaulting on the eyes The film is a complete failure that it missed a potential opportunity to save the DCEU franchise. I can understand the appeal of the fans for this movie, but it was just a pain.",Suicide Squad
712,cncsurf,"Confusing. Boring. Spoilers, I guess...",2,4 January 2017,"Just rename the film ""1 hour of Margot Robbie in Booty Shorts,"" because that was about the only thing keeping some people interested. The action certainly wasn't interesting. It was a mess. I've never read the comic books so I don't know any of the characters other than Batman and The Joker. Batman makes a couple cameos at the request of some psychopathic woman. Was her character suppose to be a good guy? She kills three FBI computer guys for absolutely no reason. The ""bad guys"" are brutalized by supposed other good guys YET the super villains do nothing menacing to any of the ""good guys"" even when they have the chance. The Joker? Why was the joker in this movie? He does nothing and contributes nothing and his character is so different from any other Joker portrayal all the way back to Cesar Romero. The only character who gets any decent portrayal and sympathy is the MS13 fire creating gangster and when he starts getting interesting they ruin it with a sudden explosion of action and 10 seconds later the scene is over. The director tries WAY to hard to recreate the Christian Bale dark portrayal of Batman but throws in so many stupid one liner jokes it just doesn't work. Nothing ties the mess together. Each character gets about 2 minutes of buildup. The super-duper Non-Human villains get about a 3 minute buildup. There is no planning of the schemes. They just suddenly create a machine to destroy the world. If you want to see a movie that has all bad terrible people but they are likable and you end up cheering for them go watch ""The Wild Bunch."" Avoid Suicide Squad.

The only redeeming thing about this movie is Harley Quinn, Deadshot, and Amanda Waller. The Enchantress looked cool in the beginning of the movie, but her design got a downgrade half way through the movie. The action is bland and unmemorable. The movie has a lot of characters in it, but I felt like they didn't know what to do with most of them. The Joker in this movie is by far the worst interpretation of the Joker in any media I have ever seen.

I liked some things about it, mainly the performances by Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and Jai Courtney. I wish I could say the same for Jared Leto because he's a good actor, but this version of the Joker is not good to me. And forget the fact that he was preceded by Heath Ledger and all the other actors who played the character. This individually was a bad performance, but not for a lack of trying. It just didn't work. But he's not the only one. Joel Kinnaman, who unfortunately I have the same issue with all the time, was so bland and boring in this. I liked him on the show ""The Killing"" as his performance fit the tone of the show. But not here. Cara Delevingne wasn't too great as Enchantress either. The editing is atrocious too. The style of this movie is just jarring, from the random songs on the soundtrack, to the titlecards that are used to introduce all the characters. I get that they were trying to be unconventional in comparison to the other superhero movies at the time, but it didn't really make it all that edgy or exciting.

717,elale-573-971300,"fun with delicious characters, lots of fighting and stuff on fire",8,25 August 2016,"I loved Harley. She steals every scene she's in. Reviews I've read that said the Joker sucked were wrong, he didn't suck, he just got outshone by Harley. We're used to seeing a Joker who owns every inch of celluloid real estate he comes close to, and that wasn't this guy. In this movie it's Harley in the spotlight. Also I think reviews that said the Joker / Harley relationship was too nice were wrong. There's a scene near the beginning of the movie where she's still Dr. Harleen Quinzel and Joker says he's going to hurt her a lot and then he zaps her brain with electricity and the next thing it cuts to her being Harley and totally insane. It's pretty clear he drove her nuts by hurting her; I don't think it was ""too nice"" or ""not abusive enough to be true to the comics"" at all. I mean, how graphic do we really want to see that in a movie with live actors? This was plenty to get the point across. Besides Harley, the two other characters with good character development and an arc are Deadshot and El Diablo. Deadshot, Will Smith's character, is clearly the star. El Diablo is almost a nonentity right up until the bar scene, but then he's great. Since the beginning of the movie had a lot of characters' backstories I get why they held off on this guy's backstory until later. The final strong character is Waller, arguably the real villain, as several other reviews have said. On that point I agree with most of the reviews I've read. Plot? What plot? Just toss the characters on the screen and let them kick ass. It's fun. I think this was the best DC movie so far. They just let the action be action and the characters be themselves and it worked. Yeah, I could wonder why a character like Boomerang who doesn't have any powers is trying to fight alongside mutants, and against mutants, er oh excuse me ""metahumans"" like whatever DC. Anyway, never mind the why, that's not what this is about. Waller just opened her crayon box of cray and scribbled all over the city, never mind why anyone would think Harley belongs fighting alongside the crocodile from the sewers and fireball guy. Oh, and that fireball stuff: yeah I like. Destroy, destroy, destroy! Burn baby burn! Mwahahahaha! And if it's still twitching Harley can smash it with a baseball bat. The action is fun, even if we have kind of already seen most of those effects before. The creepy bubble head things were different, though.

719,miesnekawalki,Barely watchable,4,8 August 2016,"First off let me say that I'm not familiar with comic book stories. I used to have some comic books (mainly Superman, Batman and Spiderman) but generally I'm pretty casual moviegoer when it comes to comic book movies. If there's a comic book blockbuster that looks fun - I'm in. Plus I want to support interesting ideas, and judging Suicide Squad from its trailers and promo materials - it certainly looked like one. That's why I decided to go and see it, and boy was it an experience...Good things: casting was pretty much spot on (with one exception - check 'bad things' section). Will Smith as Deadshot is great, Margot Robbie gives over the top performance (that some people might find annoying/stupid, I liked it), hell, even Jai Courtney looked like he had fun portraying crazy Aussie Boomerang. story line. Now, I don't know if this came from comic books 1:1 or what. I just liked the dynamic between unconventional villain and our 'heroes' who are also supposed to be bad guys Enchantress moments. I loved the design of the witch, special effects of her transformations were awesome Bad things: Joker. This is the same problem that I had with Jessie Eisenberg in BvS - he's not crazy and menacing at all... Jared Leto's portray of The Joker is over the top, but in a goofy and laughable way, which, I recon, was not the general intention... As if this is not bad enough, almost ALL scenes with the joker were already shown in the trailers, what a joke :P sloppy universe building. 10 seconds of Batman here, 5 seconds of Flash there, it's like those stupid videos in BvS, totally anticlimactic and useless. PG-13 - so we have this pack of scum, thieves, assassins, crazy people, etc. Where's swearing? Where's blood? Where's something that would make the characters and this whole world believable? rushed plot. This movie contains - brief story of EVERY suicide squad member, Enchantress betrayal, joker / harley quinn stockholm syndrome love story, witch plan to destroy humanity and suicide squad coming together to fight evil, few cameos (Batman, Flash), something about Superman... In other words - BvS syndrome - packing too much into one movie and setting up universe rather than concentrating on a cohesive story too many dark stories from the past. Like that flame guy story, damn that was depressing. weird plot twists. What up with that Indian guy who can climb easily and gets killed almost immediately after his introduction? What up with joker not dying (it's like they can't just kill joker, because he has to appear in the next 1000 DC movies, so let's just bring him back despite the fact that he DIED in that helicopter crash)... camera work - action scenes are unwatchable. Shaky cams plus general mess of stuff flying in the air makes it pretty hard to see what's going on. You might say that it's a standard of action movies nowadays. For that I say - I don't like it :P 'team roles'. I understand the flame guy being in the suicide squad. I understand Deadshot. I sort of understand Croc. But what the hell would they need Boomerang and Harley Quinn for? Boomerang is a thief and throws boomerang = useless. Harley Quinn is crazy and can swing the baseball bat = useless. It's like if you apply logic to this movie - it doesn't work. The problem is - it doesn't work as a mindless fun either...And the worst thing of all - the ending. Don't get me wrong, I was 100% sure that suicide squad will be a part of DC universe, but seeing them go back to prison and knowing that they are going to be used again and again and again in later movies feels so damn depressing for some reason...All in all - Suicide Squad is not a terrible movie, but it's not good either. 5/10 :/",Suicide Squad
720,ThunderingTim,The ingredients are good but the soup isn't,6,19 April 2020,"Suicide Squad
I feel SS is a missed opportunity. The ingredients are there but somehow fail to make a good soup. At the heart of the problem is the ludicrous nature of the whole idea of SS. I a movie that establishes the existence of the Flash and Batman they answer the question ""what of the next Superman is evil"" by arming a 100 pound mental patient with a baseball bat. The whole movie is further stopped in its tracks by Flag and Waller, 2 of the worst characters I have ever seen. Roid raging, meth addicted, over the top aggressive against people who can kill them in a nanosecond. They don't get the good kind of hatred one can get from a bad guy, but the 'Turn the TV off' hatred that no character should invoke as it defeats the purpose of the movie. There's totally wasted characters like Katana, introduced with one line of forced exposition and who spends most of her time menacingly unsheathing her weapon before inexplicably joining the SS based on nothing.
Halfway through the movie I cannot even begin to describe the anger I felt when I realized that half the movie is a rescue mission to save Waller (you know, the supposedly though woman whose complete inaptitude causes more problems than the main baddie of the movie). The main baddie, speaking of which, is played by a model who can't act, has a brother that is pointless, and uses fisticuffs instead of her wizard power to fight the SS, all set to an obnoxious soundtrack whilst the utterly unnecessary Joker is whining in the background of the ""plot"". To add insult to injury, when the SS somehow emerges victoriously Waller immediately gets in their faces trying to act tough, even though, I'll say it again, the whole Earth was risked on her utter uselessness in her job. Why does everyone bend over backwards to accommodate her? Just have Croc bite her head off and it would be a happy ending.
There are some good elements, like Margot Robbie and the use of colour, but you have Will Smith who plays Will Smith, a guy with a boomerang, and a crocodile man who is a racial stereotype. I had high hopes for this movie but you might as well watch the trailers and you'll get all the good stuff without suffering through this cinematic torture.",Suicide Squad
721,nilsurban-50399,Suicide is more fun,1,9 October 2016,"Since it's faster to tell you what's good about this movie than what's bad, here we go: Margot Robbie is great! ...and the way she manages to give life to a character that suffers - like every character in this movie - from the god awful dialogues, the bad costumes, bad acting, the wannabe-try-hard-complete-fail-coolness, and the terrible plot. Of course this is far from saving the movie!1. Dialogues:
Some of the worst c**p I've heard in a long while. uncool, meaningless, unfunny, far from gritty, farther from credible. example:
HARLEY QUIN, looking at Killer Croc, says: ""He's ugly on the outside, too."" KILLER CROC: ""Not me shorty (long dramatic pause) - I'm beautiful.""
HARLEY QUIN: ""Yeah, you are.""
KILLER CROC growls
Is that supposed to be funny, cool, meaningful, gritty, mysterious....or is it just c**p?!?! And the movie is full of this...2. Bad Costumes:
Either boring, not befitting of a modern version of the villain or just plain hilarious like the enchantress.3. Bad acting:
Will smith is will smith. Delevingne portraits the enchantress like a cheap B-movie witch, Kinnaman desperately trying to sell us the tough guy. everyone else (except Margot Robbie) fails or doesn't get the chance to be anything meaningful.4. Bad actor choice:
Delevingne, Smith, Joel Kinnaman don't fit into their roles. Especially Delevingne looks like a teenager although she is supposed to be an archaeologist.5. Action:
Wave of useless minions which don't pose a threat anyways - meaningless trash talk - wave of useless minions posing even less of a threat - meaningless trash talk - wave of minions - trash talk - uninspired, short and boring boss fight - more meaningless trash talk that no human with a brain could emotionally or intellectually relate to. If at least the action scenes would show something spectacular or creative or flabbergasting..but...nope. We get good old Steven Seagal B-movie fight scenes of the 90's.6. Plot:
Irrelevant7. Character Development:
No (unless u browse Wikipedia while watching)8. The Joker:
One major reason for me to go see this flick was the Joker. Unfortunately he almost never shows up and when he does, his appearances are so short that Jared Leto can't really shape his personal take on the new Joker. That's why I want to be cautious in judging him and his performance. I can't say that I liked the new Joker as much as I did Jack Nicholson's or Heath Ledger's, but given the circumstances he did an OK job.Conclusion:
Definitely among the worst movies of the past ten years considering the amount of money and actor-potential involved.",Suicide Squad

I just got back from the IMAX viewing in 3D and have to say that Suicide Squad is so much better than expected!!! The action was fantastic, much more so than you would think a PG-13 film would be. The actors hit their portrayals of the characters almost perfectly and the tie-in to the DC Universe did not feel forced or rushed. Jared Leto's Joker was more in tune with the comic than Heath Ledgers version, and he nailed the part -- for his limited screen time. Margot Robbie was the epitome of Harley Quinn and was flawless in her performance. I was even pleasantly surprised with Will Smith's performance, he actually showed up and brought his A-Game with him. It was easy to overlook that Deadshot was white in the comic as Smith personified the character excellently. It is obvious that David Ayer knew the source material and his target audience throughout the directorial process. No, this was not a perfect piece of cinematic history, but it was a great summer popcorn flick and is worth the price of admission. Yes, Ayer had to cram a whole lot of stuff in a two- hour movie.

Its only the ""G"" rating DC still keeps, where its heroes don't kill the villains, that explains why DC even HAS any villains for the heroes to fight.

Problem with Suicide squad is there is no Tom Hanks to carry the audience in the journey like saving private Ryan.Will smith was good but his role was more like taking orders ,so kind of take away many characteristics from that character .Action sequence is mostly shooting . there are some fun parts with Harley Quinn .Fight was in the night ,it was road,building with not much special fight scene to actually care about .That is the reason felt like a Battlefield game scene where mission is just to go forward .I would say badly choreographed or no choreographed fight sequence for a big budget Hollywood movie .There are back stories for every character but didn't' felt much even for Will smith's story cz there was not much depth on that story but in the case of Harley & Joker felt that story with heart .There are actually one moment among the group(will smith & harley) where i actually felt the chemistry inside the group other than that even in that drinking scene seen on trailer felt nothing .Now i think the Movie Predator(2010) actually showed more character depth among criminals who were abducted & thrown into the alien planet than suicide squad maybe due to in Predator 2010 industry leading top actor/actresses who showed their own charm in acting which suicide squad lacked in most other characters exception Joker,harley ,(will smith kind of but not much due to lack of back story depth).I think the movie struggle between showing inner struggle of the characters & being cool .Now if criminals act like cool through whole movie then audience might not care much but to be Marvel like (last minute edit) the criminals have to act cool .So whole movie old edit showed one side & new edit showed another side.Also maybe due to things which make a groups of people care about each other lacked in this movie or maybe team work wasn't the main theme of the movie but even when they acted as team their motivation behind that wasn't that clear.Audience might get confused to what to feel but luckily for Harley her story didn't changed much & that story showed a smooth transition from one part to another but that can't be said for other characters .Sometime directors had to make hard decision to make audience feel something or even to bring the characters more closure of each other but which suicide squad lacks mostly or director chose not to go in that directionAfter watching suicide squad i feel if they had added more of the Joker & Harley scene & based the movie around that story line then It could have been another Dark Knight level movie but they have ignored the best part of the movie & went to a direction which most audience can care less.i give it 6.0",Suicide Squad

Here are some notes about things in the movie:-Will Smith is excellent in his role. He is the one practically saving this movie.-About Jared Leto's Joker, I want to say I liked him, but honestly, 5 minutes are not enough to have a honest opinion about someone's work.-Robbie's role as Harley Quinn is somewhat forgettable. What she mainly does is stand there, look pretty and say something dumb occasionally.-The action is excellent. It's one of the good things about the movie.-The plot doesn't exist. Honestly, there's not a story there.-The dialogues are easily the worst part about the movie. They are extremely cringe-worthy and it's like someone's son/daughter wrote them. Whoever casually insults Marvel about lines, shouldn't talk after this movie.About whether you should watch it is up to you. It's not movie of the year material, but it can pleasantly kill some time. The most annoying thing is that this movie had potential, however, much of it was wasted by whoever took the decision to make it as kid-friendly as possible. Why do that?

729,jenjentaro,"More questions than answers, don't take this too seriously",4,5 August 2016,"I'm not a comic book reader so I knew nothing about the Suicide Squad before this movie. This is nowhere as polished as existing Marvel films but it has some of its highlights (though a lot of it already got highlighted in the trailer).The movie started off messy and fragmented. Character introductions were bias with most screen time spent on Will Smith's character Deadshot and Margot Robbie's character Harley Quinn. And then they just quickly glimpsed over Boomerang, El Diablo, Killer Croc. Katana showed up from nowhere, and Slipknot disappeared as quickly as he appeared. You can say Suicide Squad is a pretty unmemorable squad featuring only two stars, Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Despite the movie's effort in putting more explanation into Deadshot and Harley Quinn's backstories...I feel I still don't really understand who Harley Quinn really is. And Cara Delevingne's character Enchantress. Who is she really? What's her true motivation? Nothing is developed with that character. Cara is fitting for the emotionless scary bad witch role, but her mean eyebrows ruined her distressed girl act as Dr. June Moone. And then there's the plot. The way they set up the plot in the beginning was incomplete due to poor transitions and explanations. The idea of Waller getting the approval to assemble the Squad by showing off Enchantress' magical powers seemed so stupid...it looked like the screenwriters took an easy way out to move along the plot. How the ""villains"" got defeated in the end seemed really stupid too. The movie is basically saying that all-powerful 4000 years old magical beings (Enchantress and Incubus) were defeated by a bomb and a heart that was easily stolen. There was so much more potential to these characters than what was shown.The movie found more coherence once the Squad found its purpose with the rescue mission and wasn't interrupted by random backstory interjections. But the questionable plot left me with still more questions than answers: How come Waller just popped up again with no scratches or battle scars? What happened to the little army of mutants created by the witch before their final scene of defeat? What is Diablo??! Is he non-human because I was pretty surprised when he just suddenly turned into a giant and fire monster. Where was his backstory? The lack of explanation or character development made it really hard for me to care about them when they die. Now some positives that stuck with me: - There were some amazing performances by Leto as Joker, Robbie as Harley Quinn, and Smith as Deadshot. Harlely Quinn had some good action sequences - The humour was pretty good. (Inconsistent but still good). - Sick soundtrackVerdict: Still a no brainer fun action movie to watch if you don't hold yourselves too seriously over its flaws.",Suicide Squad

732,djmotiv,Much better than the initial critics led me to believe,7,3 August 2016,"I've learned not to trust professional critics too much, doing so had me bored witless watching A Girl With a Pearl Earring and potentially avoiding Suicide Squad. Which in itself kinda explains why the initial movie wasn't to my liking.Having been disappointed by BMvsSM, I was holding out hope that SS would improve on that disappointing excuse for entertainment. Especially since Marvel has had me firmly in their grasp, and Deadpool which I waited many years for, reigniting my passion for those beyond Marvel's firm grasp ... Even if it is in the neighbour's yard.SS starts off at an intentionally and somewhat unavoidable slow pace for a movie, the only way this could possibly have been sped up is if the characters had been introduced in previous movies and this outing being their group debut. So you have to accept that for a large troupe there is character background to go through, although not enough to slow the movie down too much.It's hard to work out who the main antagonist is in the movie, but generally speaking there are 3. The Joker, Enchantress and Amanda Waller herself. Enchantress arguably plays the main antagonist, but without a huge amount of screen time, which is one of my few issues with the movie. It was far too busy with too many antagonists and running story lines to stay focused and engaged and even passionate about their mission. The only person you do actually want them all to take out, ironically is Amanda Waller - which fits with her comic book character anyway - so in that respect, she us true to story. The Joker story-line for me just distracted from the rest of the story. It was obviously a set up for another outing but didn't need to happen here.There is great chemistry between the key SS members and some funny lines that keep you laughing, even if a little nervously. This isn't however an Avengers ensemble type of humour. Margot Robbie and Will Smith both do admirably, with Margot Robbie even producing a very Harley Quinn sounding voice. Overall, I loved it. Would have preferred a slightly less convoluted story-line but otherwise I thought it was great and well worth that first midnight viewing in NZ.",Suicide Squad
733,jogre17,"Not anywhere near a perfect movie, but definitely worth seeing.",6,6 August 2016,"(The spoilers I talk about will not ruin anything for you. They are just minor.)I would like to start off with about a year ago when I heard this movie was happening. I was already having bad thoughts about BvS and at the time I had no idea these movies were connected in the same universe. I was excited for this movie because Arrow gave me a brief and awesome look at what these guys are about. When I heard that Will Smith is playing Deadshot, I thought,""What the hell is wrong with these people? He's nowhere close to portraying Floyd Lawton/Deadshot."" Well, over time the thought of him doing so kind of grew on me as I was seeing more of him in the trailers.Now let's go back to about a week before the release. I'm super excited for the concept of the film and dying to see it to see how it turns out. At the same time starting to have doubts about DC's film making all because of the whole BvS travesty that we just don't talk about anymore. At this point, i just don't know what to think.Now we're at the day I get to see it, August 6 at 8:30 PM. I sit down in a fairly packed theater and I watch the movie with my best friend. Bot me and him walked out of there thinking that it was a pretty good movie. That's saying a lot since he is the 50% that didn't care for BvS and I was on the other half trying to shine some light on it.Now, the movie.There were a lot of good things about this movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was perfect and Will Smith, just wow! Much better than I thought. Just at times he was a little too Will Smithy. Those 2 characters summed up most of the movie. Everyone else did a fine job portraying their characters. Oh, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was exactly what this movie needed. She was exactly that bad ass bitch that she needed to be.The things that weren't as good about the movie is that it was maybe a little too fast paced at times and has a couple minor plot holes. Those can easily be bypassed though if you don't think too much of it.Now, I will talk about and argue about the things other people are complaining about and saying why the movie is terrible, which is false. 1. It feels like multiple movies trying to be one.I understand why people think this, but it just really doesn't feel that way. Yes, the Joker has a romantic background story with Harley Quinn and they want to show that in flashbacks a bit to show a bit of her origin to lead up to where she is now. People are saying that could easily be a whole other movie. Lie!! If DC tried to do such a thing it would be long, boring and dragged out a lot because there would have been a lot of filler scenes that just wouldn't make sense.2. The Joker doesn't get enough screen time.Well, no crap! This movie isn't about him. Its's about the Suicide Squad. Yes, Harley Quinn and him have their thing going on, but that is the sole purpose of him being in the movie. To acknowledge that he exists in this world and to help give Harley Quinn her background story even more.3. DC Sucks and should just quit trying.That's right people. Trolls exist. They just want to get people rattled up for no reason to a point where people will actually believe them. If you truly believe that you have a brain of your own, then don't let others persuade you you morons.Well, that's my review. My best suggestion is to just go in there and see the movie even if your slightly interested. If you truly believe that this movie looks completely stupid and waste of your time from the trailers, then superhero movies aren't for you and you probably won't enjoy it as well as others.",Suicide Squad
734,tedd0093,The worst of the worst,3,19 February 2018,"This movie had so much potential but ended up being a total letdown. I'm not basing my review on the sheer fact of disapointment, but on the movie in general. The story is bad, the villain is awful, the characters are written so lazy, and the tone is inconsistent. Some moments of the movie are really good though! the fight scenes in the mall - and the one between the antagonist (God) and Diablo, the bar scene (no, no - the uncut one), the backstory for Harley Quinn, and some of the joker parts. The editing seems to have left the film with a bit of controversies (to say it mildly), because the rest of the movie is either crap or poorly directed. The worst things about this movie is the flat characters, the cheesy dialogue, and the awkward character interactions. the good things about the movie are the few good scenes, the charming set of actors that keeps it somewhat interesting, and the effects that holds up to the standard of a superhero movie (I know it's antiheroes, but the writers didn't). Also the movie never slows enough down to being boring, but is still really bad.",Suicide Squad
735,veensepeper,Kind of the best DC-Universe movie,7,29 August 2016,"As far as movies within the DC universe go, this was the best (ish) so far. It's not a good movie, but the potential is showing. I liked it - but it was far from perfect.I liked how it started non-linear, but as the movie progressed they moved into a more traditional structure - taking away from the competitive edge.Characters were introduced twice, which was redundant. Just having them introduced through Amanda Waller's narration at the meeting would have been sufficient. Moreover, one member of the team did not have an introduction in the beginning of the film (let alone two), so when this character appears halfway the movie, you KNOW he/she will be dead within minutes.The soundtrack was phenomenal. The song selection was the best ever in a movie... but all the songs were cut off too soon, so you didn't get to stay in the mood they were supposed to set. They kept on playing a note or two, and right after you recognize the song they cut it away. This is REALLY REALLY REALLY annoying. Worst was the Eminem song, which they chopped up so the part that they actually played was robbed of its flow.And we must discuss the Joker, and Jared Leto's portrayal of the character. The character had a whole lot of build-up. Both in the movie itself, as in the marketing around it. Therefore, the actual LACK OF RELEVANCE he had to the plot was an UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. Although Leto went totally method to get the part right, his acting came off more as imitating the Joker instead of being the Joker. And the design of the character didn't help. Maybe it's just some getting used to. But it's definitely not love at first sight.To end on a positive note: this has a slight edge on BvS and is indefinitely better than MoS. Plus, they made this before MARVEL made a Thundbolts movie. Kudos for that.",Suicide Squad
736,rscafanever,Cliché hero movie,6,14 October 2016,"The story is rather simple: gather a crew of bad guys and fight an evil wanting to end the world. Only few story lines are added to the main story.Simple stories can still be good. However, the stories in Suicide Squad are too transparent, too predictable, and sometimes even boring.Despite the thin plot, it is still a decent hero action film. Good special effects. Good CGI. Good action scenes. Decent acting. Nice action scenes. Good for an evening of entertainment, and certainly a good one for teenagers.But it misses subtlety. It's too obvious. A perfect example is the music, where popular classic songs are used to 'beef up' the film. Little character development - a common trap for hero movies. It's like an average Bond movie: good action, but don't expect much more.Some classic action movie mistakes were made: the sound goes minus 10 when in the battle scenes an actor has to say a line. Additionally, numerous inconsistencies: where does Harley Quinn get her smartphone from? And cliché dialogues all along the film.A few positive points though: Jared Leto's Joker made a good appearance, even though it's not comparable to Heath Ledger's legendary performance in The Dark Knight (2008). The use of colours is experimental, maybe a little over the top but still inventive.All in all a decent action movie, but the plot had more potential than the result.",Suicide Squad
737,Staffenburgen,Suicide Squad: A Fable about Shared Universes and Studio Interference,3,13 August 2016,"Very early into Suicide Squad, I had the nagging feeling that everything was about to fall off the rails. As the film continued, some small moments hinted at what could have been. Unfortunately, by the time this bloated CGI disaster had concluded, the extent of the damage was clear. This is a colossal misfire from Warner Brothers, and is another step towards the end of DC's Extended Universe. Before I get into my review, let's travel back to a more optimistic time for this franchise. 13 months ago, Suicide Squad's first trailer premiered at Comic-Con, and immediately it was pegged as one of 2016's most anticipated movies. More than that, it appeared to be a potential antidote for super-hero fatigue. An original concept, a talented cast, and a strong directing and writing presence in David Ayer justifiably substantiated people's excitement. Then, Batman v. Superman happened, and if the rumors are to be believed, that's when everything changed behind the scenes. One of the film's dumber lines has Amanda Waller muse about throwing somebody in a hole and throwing away the hole. Hilariously, I am almost positive that this is what Warner Brothers did to David Ayer. Save for a few brief moments where a darker (and better) version of the film shines through, most of the movie plays like an extended trailer. An incredibly obnoxious soundtrack, seemingly random cuts, sudden shifts in tone, and a complete lack of character depth plague large segments of Suicide Squad. Nothing here has Ayer's signature on it, and it's shockingly disjointed and unfocused for the man behind films like Training Day and End of Watch. There is an unintentionally hilarious scene in the middle of the film that perfectly illustrates its baffling script and deranged editing. Leading up to this scene, we see Amanda Waller working closely with her team of SWAT units to contain the city-wide destruction being caused by Enchantress. Then, our main characters arrive, and Waller suddenly decides to murder every member of her SWAT team. She grabs the nearest weapon, and summarily executes everybody in the room in seconds. This is meant to show the audience how ruthless and cold Amanda Waller is, but it's so random that it winds up being funny, like a scene from a dark comedy that just strolled in for a visit. The film offers no understandable reason for her actions, and one can only assume that some vitally important scenes were cut. The only person who keeps Suicide Squad watchable is Will Smith. He plays his patented style of action hero in classic fashion, and as always, gives every scene his all. His character, Deadshot, is also one of the few characters who is given any meaningful backstory. The all-too-brief scenes with Deadshot and his young daughter are easily the film's best moments. Jai Courtney also deserves some credit as Captain Boomerang, offering up some of Suicide Squad's only laughs. Margot Robbie swings for the fences but misses as Harley Quinn, but I honestly felt this was more a result of bad editing and poor dialogue than her actual performance. The rest of the characters are dull and lifeless. There is some attempted backstory for Rick Flag, Enchantress, and El Diablo, but each of these attempts are half-hearted and obviously shoehorned in. Katana, Killer Croc, and Slipknot's backstories are relegated to throw-away lines. Slipknot's treatment by the script is particularly hysterical. He is introduced as a man who is ""good at climbing"" and then ten minutes later his character is done away with completely. On the other hand, Katana's backstory actually sounds rather interesting. We hear mentions of a soul-stealing sword and some lingering grief for her character but this leads absolutely nowhere. I nearly forgot to mention the Joker. Jared Leto is completely forgettable here, and most of his scenes are just plain boring. This is easily the worst rendition of the Joker to date. Also, as most people are aware by now, he's barely in the movie. This is pretty disappointing, not because Jared Leto brings anything new or exciting to the character, but because his absence severely hampers Harley Quinn's character development. Hopefully, their relationship is more thoughtfully fleshed out in later instalments, should they actually happen.Lastly, the cameo appearances for the other members of the Justice League, namely Batman and the Flash, are wholly unnecessary. The presence of their characters adds nothing to their respective scenes, and serve only to remind us that these movies all exist in the same universe. Some of Marvel's movies suffer from the same problem, and hopefully it's a habit that both of these studios can start avoiding in the future. This is not a criticism at the concept of shared universes, but merely a complaint that throwing in characters that serve no purpose to the script just muddles the plot and makes each individual movie feel less cohesive. Suicide Squad is plainly and simply, a terrible movie. It should serve as a lesson to studios around the world that shared universe movies can fail, and that studio interference can easily destroy a film's vision. If there is any truth to the rumors that have been swirling this past week, Warner Brothers is deserving of the criticism it is receiving. Hopefully the producers will lock themselves out of the editing room for the next few instalments. It certainly would have helped this movie. RATING: 3/10",Suicide Squad
738,WildWombatt,Entertaining and enjoyable despite some flaws!,8,4 August 2016,"For starters, I am both a Marvel and DC fan, but I'll admit that DCU movies have not been that good lately when compared to MCU movies. Nonetheless, I found this movie entertaining and enjoyable. I found movies like Man of Steel just ""okay"" and Batman V. Superman was over decent; still, I was still hyped for the Suicide Squad and was excited to see what they would offer.Every movie has its flaws, and I tried my best to stay away from reading reviews before watching this movie. Your best bet is to just go in blind and not hold any expectations and see how this movie will affect you. I was excited because of their direction with a DC movie that has a cast of all villains/anti-heroes, but I was also a little skeptical seeing how DC movies have been a bit lacking lately. I really liked this movie, of course it has its cons like any other film. I love all the characters, the action was fun to watch, and it made me laugh several times throughout the movie. My biggest issue with the Suicide Squad was mainly about how they chose to focus on the characters. Some characters got a lot more screen time and had occasions where their background was explored a little more deeply, while some characters didn't get that much time or focus. Realistically, the cast was large so it would be more confusing and overbearing if they took too much time with each character. (That's also a double-edged sword though, in my opinion). I wish they would have given more screen time or backstory to the other characters, as I really loved Boomerang and Katana, but they didn't have much of an opportunity to be explored more. You do get a good amount of Harley Quinn and Deadshot, which is nothing to complain about as they're also both great characters.Overall, pretty good movie. It was entertaining and enjoyable, and I love all the characters. I wished they would give more time to other members of the squad instead of focusing on just a few too much. Some action scenes felt satisfying while some felt just mediocre. A tip would be to try and not hold any expectations or have your mind be painted by critics or other viewers, go see it and decide yourself! Despite some minor flaws here and there, you'll find an entertaining summer movie.",Suicide Squad
739,rick-jatti,more than a missed opportunity,4,10 March 2018,"I'm astounded by how much wasted money was poured into this movie. if the studio and the producers saw the script, why did they fund this movie? there are an incredible number of flaws, so much so that I'd call the movie a flaw in and of itself and it'd be quicker to name what's good about the movie. but there's no fun in that, so let's run through what makes this flick horrible.the base plot. you can't have the suicide squad going on a mission to fight a supernatural and/or magical entity. in almost every iteration of the suicide squad, at least half of the team has no superhuman ability, or at least a power that's not very, well, powerful. this adaptation is one of those, with the entire squad being basically powerless except for diablo. so most of the squad is essentially useless during the most important parts of the movie, seeing that the main villain is a magical witch and her brother. a lot of the plot details.
-what was the point of keeping the full details of the mission secret for so long? the squad can't do anything anyway. they have bombs in their necks.-the beef between flag and deadshot that headed off most of the first half of the movie just didn't make sense. it was inorganic, and we all knew how it would end.-thrusting bits and pieces of the harley quinn/joker backstory into the movie here and there was both annoying and confusing-the camaraderie between the group felt very fake and shoehorned by the end. -and others i can't remember off of the top of my head.the script. deadshots lines were absolutely horrible most of the time. diablo's were a little cliché as well. flag's weren't great. harley quinn's were fine, but i'll expand on her below. but i have to say, killer croc had the worst dialogue of any superhero movie this century, hands down. it's hard to put it into a review without going through the movie scene by scene, but if you watch you'll probably know what i mean when i say that the script could've been better written by an average liberal arts sophomore.the acting i guess was alright. i would attack will smith, but i know that he was given awful lines to work with, and when he had decent dialogue, he delivered pretty well. jai courtney's horrible acting was at least slightly hidden. joel kinnaman, though, had some very rough moments, even though for about 65% of the movie he was somewhere between passable and good. viola davis disappointed me, not because she was bad, but because she was only okay. jared leto, though, was a disgrace. his joker voice sounded like his mouth was full of spit, his laugh was just plain bad, and the way his scenes were shot and edited didn't do him any favors. margot robbie is a special case. i think she did well, but the problem was that everything around her was so bad, it just made her lines, acting, and character be judged sort of unfairly. i think that if the other aspects of the movie were good, then she'd shine a little more, but the overall low quality of the rest of the movie clouds our judgement of her performance and the character of harley quinn.the pacing of a lot of the scenes is also disjointed. i wouldn't say the movie is too fast paced, but it rushes through a lot of things it could slow down on.don't watch this movie. i thought i would, saying to myself that it couldn't be that bad. well, it really can. i don't understand people who say this is better that BvS. that movie is more boring and dreary with a few bright spots rather than just wholly a failure like this one is.",Suicide Squad

741,grintemcstinger,"Not the big breakthrough, but fun nonetheless",7,9 August 2016,"After the overburdened messy trainwreck that was Batman V Superman, I had much doubt for this one... At the first look there again are a ton of characters and again a weird choice of changes to an iconic arch enemy (you don't wanna think of Lil Wayne when you see the Joker, okay?). Overall it seemed like its going to repeat the same mistakes as BvS. And to an extend it did. However the main difference is that this one actually manages to provide fun.As critics seem to be exceptionally harsh with this one, I believe that much of it depends on what your expectations are. If you think of this anything more than easy entertainment popcorn-movie action, you'll gonna be disappointed. Otherwise you're in for a fun ride, even though it has a few bumps here and there.Part of the reason it is entertaining to me is how stylishly it was filmed. The movie starts off almost like a montage of MTV music videos with plenty of licensed music; I'd say they even went overboard with the music. Whether you like the music or not is a matter of personal taste - personally I didn't find it all that fitting and was a little bit annoyed when they played Eminems ""Without me"". But it is undeniable that these scenes have a certain ""coolness"" to them. There is a lot of action going on, however the plot is paper-thin. It basically can be summarized in one sentence, and it's the most predictable one for most common comicbooks or action-movies. But what made me not care about that is the already mentioned stylishness that indeed provided the most fun. The way Batman was utilized, even tough in a really small portion, was effective. I loved his biggest scene, which I won't spoil here even though it is in the trailer. What's also great are the many shootout scenes and gunplay. Kinda reminded me of the 90's action movies, which is always a good thing. Even the PG13 didn't spoil it.As far as for the characters... They mostly are good and satisfying. Lets start with the iconic one first: Joker - as I mentioned, not really happy how they changed him. Lacks the sarcastic menace and intensity. Far from bad, but they could've been more imaginative and let him go all out more. His henchmen were awesome though. Harley - Pretty good actually, from the trailer it seemed like she'd be mostly about making faces and grimaces and be an annoyance, but she was fine and a pretty good movie adaptation of the character. Lots of here humorous scenes were really weak though... that was some truly lazy writing.Deadshot - this one is a bit of a polarizing one. The character definitely got the Will Smith treatment, and it's hard to separate him from other action characters Will played. Even though I love his action scenes and his gunslinging is truly badass, he seems more like a good guy than a bad guy. It is tough to escape the feeling that it is indeed because of Will. Would've been interesting to seem him play someone purely evil for a change. The others didn't get much screen time, but to me they were satisfying. Katana, Croc added to the action. Boomerang to the comic relieve (was actually pulled of well without overdoing it, kudos for that), Enchantress was really nice to look at, provided plenty of awesome imagery, El Diablo also had a great action scene and added a little bit of dept. Slipknot was the one with the least screen-time, basically a filler but his entrance was entertaining no less.All in all entertaining, carefree action-fun. Don't expect anything deep from it. It's mostly the action and spectacle parts that deliver, and they are pulled off well. There are some emotions thrown in, nothing great or new, just here to mix-up things a little. Surprisingly the humor is really weak, but it's tolerable. Better than BvS in any case.",Suicide Squad

When it's good it's amazing but every time I got on board there would be weird editing or such that distracts. I don't want to say the people who liked the movie were wrong because it is fun and does have a dark vibe to it that are great. On the other hand, David Ayer was made a dark movie which was then mixed with the studio throwing in more Guardian style scenes. I like both styles, just not together. It tries too hard to be Guardians, even using a song used in Guardians, to the point where it doesn't have a focus. A lot of scenes were edited a little too quickly and felt out of place. I think if this movie were edited right, it would be amazing. The entire squad, Harley and Deadshot, is charismatic, likable and has a story with individual traits.

744,huey2088,Flat characters,1,29 August 2016,"It's clear that this is a blockbuster aim to rake in millions rather than a movie with a decent plot, interesting characters with meaningful relationships and good acting. Not to mention, it's been done before. Recently we've been given the franchise where superheros work together to fight evil forces. Here, it's flipped around and it's not that well done.After introducing the main evil characters, David Ayer decided it's due time for action, action and more action. Hence the characters are flat, no one really cares for them or their motives. It's because they happen to be so awfully annoying rather than intriguing considering the movie is about them. Take Hannibal Lecter for the antagonist of all time. His presence on screen was captivatingly thrilling, he had the audience glued to the plot at all times. I guess it's not Ayer's fault because trying to cram so many characters into just an over two hour blockbuster is difficult for any director. Plus it didn't help that he didn't develop the storyline which happen to be ridiculously silly and at times confusing. Then there is the dialogue. Every line spoken by Will Smith or Margot Robbie were so cliché and brain numbing. Don't even get me started on the Aussie aka Jai Courtenay's Boomerang.No doubt there will be a sequel given the success at the box office and also how chummy the characters became towards the end and with Jared Leto's Joker running loose in Gotham. My bet is that he will be the main villain next time. If you want a movie where big explosions and special effects matter more then this is for you. I watched it to see what the hype was all about. I was right, it's just hype. The one star is for Viola Davis though - for appearing in this mess and delivering her lines like a pro even if she may have wondered what the hell was coming out of her mouth.",Suicide Squad

746,narine_tevosyan,Review,8,29 March 2019,"""Suicide Squad"" is a superhero film, where a U.S. officer decides to assemble a team of dangerous, incarcerated supervillains for a top-secret mission. I liked the trailer of this movie and also the actors that will play there, thus I waited for its release with great enthusiasm. However, I can say that I liked only some parts of this movie. Despite the current situation where all these superheroes need to do their secret mission, it also demonstrates the superheroes lives separately. Each hero's life is interesting, and the most obvious drawback of this movie is that it is too short for the viewer for understanding them entirely. There are overall seven superhero characters, and I liked the lives of 4 of them. In particular the pair of Harley Quinn and Joker, Deadshot and El Diablo. I liked their stories, however, it was too short for me, and I wanted to see more. Yes, we all know that all this kind of movies, where all superheroes gather with each other, the audience can see only the mission that they do, however, there are new characters, whose movies we don't have. It will be preferable to see separate movies of these characters too and only after that watch this one, without background information about their lives. It will be more meaningful and full movie. Nevertheless, I again want to mention that I liked their stories, and I hope that we will see some separate movies too about their lives.",Suicide Squad
747,sinatrakennedy,A beautiful mess,8,5 August 2016,"First off, the movie is beautiful to look at and the squad is awesome. The way they are introduced is awesome. The music is perfect. The pace is a bit off at times and the jokers scenes feel rushed and choppy. He's never on screen long enough to get immersed in his character. This feels like editing issues after the fact. Harley Quinn is awesome, and Deadshot is perfect. The movie would have been amazing if it focused on the Joker as its villain but sadly it chooses to have a CGI Saturday morning cartoon villain instead (truly the films weakest link). It's easy to see why the critics are bashing SQ. it feels forced and rushed. As if the camera is afraid to give any one character too much screen time. Killer Croc is visually great but has the worst lines to say (his one liners fall flat). Boomerang is great. That's all I'm going to say because I enjoyed the movie. It's a mess, it's kind of like making a bacon lettuce tomato sandwich and at the last minute you realize you are out of mayo. It's still great but it's missing an important ingredient and in this case, a worthy villain of such a worthy Squad. I wanted More. For the record, I carry a torch for Batman V Superman and thought the rated R version of that film was AMAZING.",Suicide Squad
748,CallEmLikeISeeEm,Superbly packaged mediocrity,7,11 August 2016,"I was expecting much more from Suicide Squad given the massive hype it has received throughout the past year. The film centres around a group of imprisoned highly dangerous villains, including Deadshot, Harley Quinn, El Diablo and others who are recruited as a team/weapon by the CIA.The plot is quite average, with some obvious mistakes/holes. However the movie is very well shot, camera work is superb, and the highlight of the movie is the awesome soundtrack of golden oldies (The Animals, Stones, CCR and Queen to name a few) which often has you singing along.As for the actors, Margot Robbie is superb as Harley Quinn and is definitely the attention grabber in this film. Will Smith is acceptable-yet-lacklustre as Deadshot. Jai Courteney is brilliant as Captain Boomerang. My biggest disappointment was Jared Leto's interpretation of the Joker (who was absent throughout the majority of the film). All previous interpretations of the Joker captured his essence (random, slightly kooky or camp), but Leto's Joker is calculating,and portrayed as an angry (rather than crazy) mobster/pimp with too much bling on.Overall, it was a fun experience but a let down after all the hype.",Suicide Squad

750,teacherianmitchell,How did they get it so wrong?,5,1 August 2020,"Suicide Squad is nothing other than a missed opportunity - a sequence of shallow character pieces and music videos that lacks any screenwriting depth.In the run up to this movie, we were inundated with footage of Jared Leto's Joker and Margot Robbie's Harlequin in tantalising shots of tension and romantic disarray. Leto is hardly in this movie and while Margot Robbie is the one saving grace of this entire endeavour, the rest of the movie makes no sense.Rumours suggest that David Ayer's vision was cut short by studio pressure and if this is the case, then that is a travesty, as this film is a let-down for DC fans across the globe.The film insists on trying to tell too much. It results in a shallow depiction of what this film should have been and while the Affleck cameo is nice, the car-crash of a second half leaves you wanting a refund.At least WB are getting James Gunn in to redo this - fingers crossed it will wash the taste of this film out of our mouths and we can all just move on. In saying that, I can't help but feel that Ayer should get a chance to show his vision to the world - Leto and all. Fingers crossed, we can get a David Ayer cut further down the line - as this version that we currently get (along with the extended cut), is just not good enough. May the Snyder Cut pave the way for more directors getting their say.",Suicide Squad

754,dvoon-missy-mcmuffin,Borderline fun. With too much burdens of expectations for it to bear alone.,6,5 August 2016,"Was anticipating this for so long and now it has finally arrived. Keyword here is: anticipation. We must all first do this - check our own anticipation for this movie and whatever baggage of expectations that we want out the door, before the lights to the theater dims.If not, you will probably end up feeling like i did. I had my own expectations and hope for the movie - wanting it to be a dark somber exploration of gray moral characters. Continuing the dark themed of the DCEU. In which this movie is definitely not.This movie is bright, fun, chirpy to a certain extent. At times, it reminded me of the game franchise Borderlands in its execution.The humor for each character portrayed are pretty convincing. It belongs to each individual personality. It never felt like everyone is a carbon copy of a one-note-sarcastic-spewing-one-liner. Never. Each of them had their own voice and sense of humor. And for that, i am really grateful.Even though there are missteps in its execution of its story and pacing - the most annoying thing for me, was really about the songs that got way too annoyingly repetitive.All in all...i really enjoyed the chemistry that the Squad had. Each cast was believable as their characters too.As for the Joker, it is unfair to judge if this is as good as the late Heath Ledger's masterpiece of a performance; since the Joker isn't the main focus here. I will refrain judging Jared Leto's Joker, until the next installment of him being that character again (either the solo Batman film, or that of Harley Quinn's; who knows?) But for now, he does seem very very unsettling. Captivating yet scary.Currently it is on a borderline ratings for me. It varies a lot. At times good, at times bad. I found myself really enjoying it for the most times, yet i can't deny that i was equally annoyed by that constant music.Was it worth the wait? Definitely. Did it live up to what i want? No - and it is unfair for me to expect any movie to live up to my own expectations that i had built while anticipating.Will it address the problems of what BvS theatrical cut did? The most unfair judgment for this film if one was expecting it to. As the production of this Suicide Squad was well ahead before that said film was ever released to the public. No matter how much was done to ""fix"" it (i do not mind about the prior's dark humorless tone), one can not totally change a film that was already well underway. To be fair, I will leave it to the Justice League to bear that said burden.Most importantly was to ask myself: Did i enjoy it? Some what. I definitely like the Squad a lot, and wish for a sequel after this. Will i recommend it? Yes. Judge it for yourself. Movies are subjective. So is the Squad.Overall, I found this film to be ""O"" ""Kay"", some what enjoyable. At least (to me) its positivity outweighs its negativity.",Suicide Squad

Seriously, i think is time to press the stop button and start to think what kind of entertainment are making. Or is this the proof that they don't give a f*ck about that? Well, maybe they don't at all and that's why they keep doing such crap as this, so they can earn billions of dollars, for the simple fact that you know a lot of kids who grew up with this characters as their heroes will go to theaters and will pay the ticket. But the thing is they are stealing our money. They are selling us movies like if they were some coca-cola can. Movies use to be not only fun, but with a meaningful content that could make you think, and care for the characters and the story-line. Here, that simply does not happen, at any level. It is the same disappointment i felt when i watched Batman vs Superman. I think it is worthless make a review about the plot and seriously it doesn't matter. Waste of time and money. I think I'm going to start reading more books or something, because I'm done with all this foolishness-no-sense movies.

757,sweetboyy_99,"Not a masterpiece, but a great time!",7,3 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a very hyped movie, with a lot of mixed reactions, even when there were no material at all to be shown yet. I notice how a lot of the hate was towards the new joker, played by Jared Leto. And indeed, I was also skeptical about this. He could either ruin the joker, or make it better. What did he do exactly? None of it, actually. Leto's performance in Suicide Squad as the Joker was good. He gave The Joker a new face, and in my truly honest opinion, he did it well. He tried to make it his own. Not replicate or try to live up to other actors that have been playing the joker in previous movies. Now, don't get me wrong, Jared Leto's joker is nothing against Heath Ledger's version. BUT and I say this once again; he didn't ruin it. That's really my honest opinion. He's not trying to be like Ledger, he's not trying to be something that we've seen before. He's doing something new, and I liked it. Also, for those of you who read the comics, you would actually notice that Jared's take on Joker is close to his persona in the comic book series. I actually wish that he would have had more screen time, since in the entire movie he was in maybe 20 minutes of the actual 2hr film. Now, I read about this final version, and it's said to be cut out a lot and that the director had been working on his own cut, while the studio made their own. So, I can barely wait for the Directors Cut to be coming out. Hopefully, more screen time for Leto will occur and maybe a lot better pacing.Enough talking about Leto; let's talk about the actual film itself. Critics have already been slaughtering the film, giving the film awful reviews and such- The thing is; I don't really trust critics. They are too narrow-minded, they act like they are the only one who's right. I never care about what people, especially critics say about films before I've actually watched them. Then I can look back, and see if I agree with them, based on my personal opinion and interpretation of the movie itself. I can not make you like this film. Just watch the movie yourselves, then judge the film. Many people have been throwing negative reviews on this film, without second thought and some have not even watched the film. This is the worst things about reviews by critics and reviewers on IMDb. You simply cannot trust anyone, including me. So I advise you to watch the film, go back and read my review and see if you agree. That way, you won't miss a move you might have liked. All the actors does a great job portraying their characters, even though Will Smith's performance as Deadshot was a bit meh. He was funny, though. But it just feels like Will Smith playing well, Will Smith. The flashbacks in this movie are the best scenes in my personal opinion. They give you a little more depth to the story and makes you sympathize for the characters. As a person who's watched a lot of Superheroes are good, villains are bad-movies, I thought it was refreshing that for once, the villains aren't portrayed as just pure evil. However; this film absolutely has flaws. Loads of them. But rarely any film these days is flawless. There's always going to be something that you can comment on and sometimes even get annoyed by. One thing is the pacing. This film is a chaotic mess when it comes to the pacing, confusing the viewer. Too fast, too slow, but never in between. When introducing the characters, I felt that the music was overused. Every time you met a new character, and this was in quite a short time, a new song would play. However, the soundtrack is good even though it feels a bit out of place. After the mess, called BvS, I am glad to say that this film changes a lot. It shows that DC doesn't always have to make overly serious films, but can have a little fun with it too. While I like Marvel films too, they are sometimes a little bit too cartoony, the humor can feel out of place and well let's face it, sometimes you need a superhero/villain film for adults. Visually this film is amazing in every way, the amount of detail and wonderful CGI is just pure eye candy. I loved the 3D, although it wasn't quite necessary, but hey, 3D is the standard these days for films in cinema. Overall, I do not think in my own humble and honest opinion that this move deserves the hate from the critics. Most moviegoers, people I know who have seen the film, liked it. It is not a masterpiece. Long way from that. It is not an Oscar winning film by no means. It's just a really fun film to watch and I've gotta say DC is pulling in the right direction. More work needs to be done, though and there is serious problems about this film despite it being enjoyable. Reading some interviews etc, I found that the script was very rushed. (Being finished in six weeks, not okay.) Also, while I laughed and giggled at some of the jokes, some of them felt forced and out of place. However, DC has taken a huge step and I hope they will be making more movies like this one.As a final verdict, I think this movie is worth your time and is a good watch. Don't listen to critics. Heck, don't take my word for granted either. You will love it, or hate it. That's how it works, we have different opinions and tastes. I was not disappointed and I look forward to the next installment in the DC universe.",Suicide Squad
758,Dragava,Stock up on Advil.,3,26 October 2019,"The brief enjoyment I received from my viewing of ""Suicide Squad"" did not come from the film itself. During the skull-splitting climax a character delivers a line so awful, that my cinema actually began to collectively cackle at the tragedy of it. Yes. We were all laughing at just how bad this flick was. Banal, bloated and as boisterous as a sugar-fuelled child, you'll feel your eyes pulling from your head mere minutes in. The damnable squandering of first-class songs is a mere bullet point on the list of frustrating choices made in this production. Characters' motivations are as shallow as a paddling pool and just as we sense we may soon migrate to the deep end the jackhammer editing dunks you on your head. This script, as it is, seems to have been scraped out in only weeks, perhaps in a dim room whilst two sheets to the wind. The talented cast have near-naught to work with.

761,wildhunt1-585-849528,I just...don't know what to say...,2,27 January 2017,"So, I finally did it. I bit the bullet and watched Suicide Squad--the Extended Cut. And...it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. That doesn't mean it wasn't still terrible, but it was a hell of a lot better than Batman v Superman. In fact, if it wasn't set in the world of Batman v Superman, it might almost be an enjoyable movie. Here's my review.Grade: 6.5/10, C-Story: 5/10 First of all, there was a good story in this movie beneath the morass of mediocrity. You could see glimpses and glimmers of greatness that just completely went away whenever any of the characters opened their mouths to speak. The villain was probably the worst part of this movie, though, and without a good villain, you just don't have good heroes--even anti-heroes. And that was the other problem--they kept calling the Suicide Squad villains, yet they were more misguided than anything. No one was truly evil, even the main villain, who...*shakes his head* I just...I just...I have no clue what they were trying to do with her. I really don't. A magical being who was trying to use technology to destroy the world. That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and it makes even less sense as you're watching the movie.Character Development: 5/10 Again, you could see glimpses of greatness in the characters that just vanished the second they spoke. Deadshot and Harley Quinn were the two they concentrated on the most, but they really had no life or charm to them. You could see glimpses of life and charm, but it vanished as quickly as you saw it. Amanda Waller was...sorta okay I guess, but there were about twelve times when I had to ask myself why Deadshot didn't just kill her. I mean, was one of the military guys going to go over, pick up the device to blow their heads off, and press it himself? I don't think so because everyone hated Waller! Especially her subordinates! And Diablo was supposed to have this tragic story, but his story did not make sense because you assumed he burned his family alive, yet when he was holding his wife, she was perfectly fine--not a hair singed on her head--until she just turned to ash and vanished. I was like...what? And let's not forget the Joker--the worst interpretation of the Joker I've ever seen in my life. Enough said. I hope the rumors that Jared Leto won't return to the DCEU are true.Direction: 6/10 David Ayer almost had a good movie here. Almost. Another six rewrites, and he might have had a good movie, but he didn't. He had two-thirds of a good movie, which is surprising to me. But that one-third really, really, REALLY hurt this movie badly. The story wasn't told well by him, with far too much exposition and repeated exposition that just could have been handled better. And a lot of things in the movie happened JUST BECAUSE. I hate movies that demand a leap in logic from you because leaps in logic usually ended with a splat at the bottom.Casting: 5/10 Casting in this movie was decent and terrible. Joker, terrible. Will Smith, decent. Margot Robbie, decent. Jai Courtney, good. Everyone else...eh.Acting: 5/10 The acting was probably better than I'm giving it, but the actors did annoy me a tiny bit. Margot Robbie's accent kept slipping in an out. Will Smith was not Deadshot--he was Will Smith. Jared Leto was absolutely atrocious at the Joker, and I want to hurt the people who cast him as the Joker and decided to portray the Joker that way. He was not the Joker. He was someone trying to be the Joker but failing miserably. The guy playing Rick Flag was...kind of atrocious but...that could have just been his characters? I'm not sure. And the actress who played June Moon/Enchantress needs to never work in Hollywood again--ever.Cinematography: 9/10 The movie looked good, other than the floating rocks in the sky, which we really don't need to see any more of, and the horrible way the Enchantress looked and moved. The bellydancing was really, truly not needed.Music: 7/10 I really don't know how to score the music, because the songs used in the movie were great, they were just used poorly. You could see they were going for a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe, but GotG used its music so much better. The regular background music was good, though.Pacing: 10/10 The movie didn't drag like I was expecting it to. Good job there!Sets and Costumes: 7/10 I'm taking points off for the massive amounts of tattoos the Joker and Harley had. I hate tattoos to begin with, but the amount covering their bodies was almost obscene. And we know the Joker is damaged--did he had to have it tattooed across his forehead? Harley's costume wasn't as cute as she wanted it to be, either. Deadshot's was fine. Everyone else's was...eh.Enjoyment: 6/10 My enjoyment of the movie was a lot higher than I was expecting, but not high enough that I'd ever bother watching this movie again. Another entry in the DCEU that should never have been made-- or at least made better than it was. It was still better than Batman v Superman, though. God, I still have nightmares about that monstrosity of a movie.",Suicide Squad
762,adean81,Review for Suicide Squad,4,16 November 2016,"Supervillains? The characters in the movie Suicide Squad don't really feel like true villains but rather plain criminals. That could be due to the plot of the movie that uses these villains to save the day like heroes. As a consequence they can't be too villainy otherwise the audience would not relate to them. In the movie, they just refer to themselves as ""the bad guys"" so I guess even they don't really see themselves as villains. The actual villain of the story is disappointing and weak.Before the movie was released there was a lot of hype about the characters Harley Quinn and the Joker. For the most part Harley was oversexualized, but she did have some great moments, especially Will Smith's, Deadshot. The Joker and Harley I really didn't care about. Apparently, there were a lot of cut scenes of the Joker. Jared Leto gave us a different version of the Joker, which could be cool, but he was basically only used as Harley's boyfriend in this movie. Harley herself walks the line between really crazy and really caring.No member of the Suicide Squad received as much attention and insight as Harley did, but Deadshot and Diablo have a good amount that shows the audience a different side to these ""bad guys"". Will Smith does a really good job playing Deadshot. He has good character motivation, as well as some good comedic moments. Which are there to lighten up a pretty depressing movie otherwise. The reveal of Diablo's true power at the end of the movie was very impressive and he turns out to be a more complicated character than I thought.The rest of the Suicide Squad are not properly developed. Crazy Captain Boomerang, is nothing more than a petty thief with a boomerang and some knives as his weapons. Katana has an awesome sword, and we're told second hand about what her sword is and the death of her husband, but that is all we get. The character Slipknot is only brought into the gang to demonstrate that the kill-switch devices in everyone's neck will indeed kill them. That's it! Killer Croc looks really cool, but also doesn't really do anything and we get zero back story on him. The lack of character development is a problem when dealing with an ensemble cast.The worst part of the movie is the villain who is *spoilers* Enchantress. At first, the spooky, girl for the Ring looking, version of Enchantress was really cool. Once she regains her heart and becomes this Mayan goddess version, the character becomes less creepy and intimidating. For some reason, Enchantress is constantly wiggling around as she is talking. It looks really silly and there is no reason for her to be dancing around as she talks. She needs to stand still and have a better-executed plan. Wanting to destroy the world to create a new one just because you can, is not a good enough reason for being the movie's antagonist.Overall there were a lot of very cool moments in the movie. For instance, the Batman and Flash cameos. And even Viola Davis did a great job in the movie. The problem is that the movie is a series of scenes with no real build up and little character development. It could be in part because of the large cast but the villain is still a problem. There is some fun to be had, but ultimately it failed in being a cohesive story.",Suicide Squad

765,Evan_Wheatley,"Overall, a disappointment, but I remain optimistic about the future of the DCEU",4,11 April 2017,"If anything, the marketing team for ""Suicide Squad"" did their job well. Following the critical backlash against ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" the second trailer for David Ayer's supervillain team-up showcased a more light-hearted tone than that of last spring's Comic Con teaser, and all of the following trailers and TV spots were edited to near perfection. The hype was real. The stakes were high. But how did it measure up?The characters and the talent behind them are the driving force behind ""Suicide Squad."" DC could not have made a better casting decision than Will Smith as Deadshot, and Margot Robbie was nowhere to be found in this movie: there was only Harley Quinn. And where there is Harley Quinn, there will always be the Joker.All of the film's promotional material pointed to Jared Leto's clown prince of crime being the primary antagonist, but sadly this was not the case. The band of supervillains are instead tasked with taking on an evil more supernatural in nature, an odd choice considering that only two members of the squad actually have powers.The film's pacing is abysmal, its story is bland and the reason that the squad gets together makes very little sense. However, these negative aspects did not compromise my enjoyment of ""Suicide Squad"" as a whole because of the humor and fun brought forth by the characters and their interactions with one another. I look forward to seeing more of these villains, and I remain optimistic about the future of the DC cinematic universe.",Suicide Squad
766,hasanbolkiah-91427,A mess. Hear me out.,6,3 August 2016,"First of all, a quick review and this is just my opinion. This review is not to upset fans or viewers who enjoyed the movie. I could not understand the flow of this film. First of all, it had terrible pacing. You couldn't really get the feel or hang of it, before you know it, someone dies (not saying who) then events breakout into confusing shaky-cam action. It was even a visually confusing film as i struggled to enjoy the CGI. It's 2016 and a film this big, i expected a clean and slick looking movie (like the trailers) and it was the opposite. When it came to the actors of the film. Will smith , Jai Courtney and Viola Davis were standouts to me. I am not implying that the other cast members were bad, their performances were good but only a few popped out on screen. Sadly, it wasn't enough to save the film. I expected too much from Jared Leto. He was NOT terrible but he wasn't a standout to me. He was barely int he film and i didn't really bother caring about his character most of the time in the film. Margot Robbie was just OK. She played a good Harley Quinn but she just didn't do enough for me to engage with her character. A lot of things felt focused around her and it strayed way from better character developments. The pace, cgi, action (all that shaky-cam) and storytelling was pretty messy. I was looking forward to this movie and i sadly could not love it. I really wanted to but i just couldn't enjoy it enough. Overall, a 5/10. It just wasn't enough in all aspects.",Suicide Squad
767,princechin,Mediocre at Best,5,19 October 2016,"The main plot of the movie was the creation of the Suicide Squad, hince the name. The creation of the Suicide Squad was over within the first half of the movie. The rest of the scenes were thrown in just to show the way they operate. Some scenes seemed to be thrown into the movie just to waste time, such as the long-winded briefing of each character with Amanda Waller speaking, or the boring scene of Deadshot being slowly talked down by his daughter, among these fluff scenes include others (which you would have to see). The ""plot"" was very cliché and pretty much came out of nowhere. A character decides to randomly wake up and teleport somewhere thereby producing the ""plot"" which is majority of the movie.. This movie has also abused the formula of making a scene seem exciting by playing music, this illusion gets old fast, and annoying. I despised this movie, I actually liked Assault on Arkham more even though it was a cartoon. This movie was over-hyped; as are most movies this day and age.Brief summary of this movie: Inconsistent plot, Cliché plot, Predictable, and filler scenes.",Suicide Squad
768,Left_back,"A decent effort, and much better than BvsS",6,7 August 2016,"With all the hype I was expecting better from DC/Warner, but this latest effort suffers from similar overhype as BvsS.Starting with the positives:Each character of the squad had very decent portrayals from the actors – granted splitting screen time amongst them proved a little problematical at times, but the essence and motivations were brought out for all to see.The little plot twist in the middle defined the character of the squad's controller, Amanda Waller, and gave us a very ruthless character with little enough to redeem her – delicious.The not so positives:Batman rated very little time in this paeon to the canon. His presence was more throwaway than supportive. I was expecting more of a story arc where he either has a different mission or motivation to see this outing succeed or not. To get around this plot detail the writers put the action in a different city than Metropolis or Gotham (I mean really, Metropolis is across the bay from Gotham? Not in any DC universe I know) thereby giving Batman little stake in the feature.The soldier and the archaeologist being lovers is a plot device with very little credibility, doesn't follow any DC background history for the characters and although portrayed by Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne with gusto was forced and totally against type.What little background history scenes there were were only for the four main Suicide Squad characters.The downright inglorious:The Joker was downright distracting at times, in fact as a motivating factor for Harley Quinn it was too much, and took way too much screen time from the development of the other members of the squad. His flunkies were downright 'normal' instead of over the top crazy – as a different 'reality' than previous incarnations in live film I would have to say I was left severely disappointed in his portrayal here.The really Bad Guys, once it developed who they really were, had virtually no background development, if indeed at all. Not enough time to show why they were so menacing or develop how they came to be. Hint: they have a vaguely similar beginning like the villain in X-Men Apocalypse.The 'magic' the Enchantress used was the plot device used as the reason for the squad's mission with little explanation and motivation for its use.Overall: It could have been better, and it is certainly entertaining. Will it stand up to contribute another score in DC's universe? Not really, but it's only a movie.",Suicide Squad

I know a lot of people only watched it for Joker & Harley but it's called Suicide Squid for a reason. Harley felt like a bad excuse for humor. Every serious scene ends with Harley saying something.

770,StevieG338,Simply Awful,1,3 January 2019,"This is just a poor film.
There is a lot of talk about one or two performances being exceptional but really there was no good performance in this film, the plot is very shallow, the characters are poorly defined and have strange traits that are very hammy like the way they move or walk, it's almost comedic - Killer Croc going down the stairs into water is just missing comedy sound effects.The joker is exceptionally frustrating to watch, even if you leave behind the source material and take it on face value, the performance is terrible.
Harley Quinn has also received a lot of praise but the reality is it is not a good performance and the writing is terrible, some of the lines she says are cringe worthy they are so bad and she takes a strange swing from murderous sociopath to all of a sudden being a ""good guy"" and all about helping everyone.

779,ricardomartins_thesecond,Nothing new - not even current.,5,21 December 2016,"I went into this movie hoping for something on the lines on a newer look at superheroes, like something Christopher Knolan brought - some seriousness and maturity to the theme. What i got was a look back at old, beaten, tried and pop-cultured turd of a superhero movie.With the vibe of this 90's movies explained (yes, this was filmed in the 90's - i am sure of it), let me get down to the story line, which also follows a beaten, tired and old trope where something goes bad and they manage to get a gang of misfits to fight together for a greater good. Now, i don't want to go into this subject because frankly it's just too old, boring and quite frankly an insult to movie goers in this day and age.Now for the direct attacks to this pile of Sunday afternoon excuse for a movie.1 - What is Will Smith doing on the screen? We had enough of him already, not to mention he is reprising roles that have come to outgrow him. His last shot was Hancock, a tired, old and beaten down drunk of a hero. He should have stayed down. Bo-ring!2- These are villains. They are not renegade heroes turned good again. You murdered these villains.The *only* thing good to come out of this movie is Harley Quinn. Loved the actor and the love story with the (trying not to laugh at how mundane the Joker was) her love.To finish i'll just say; Wow, what a re-polished piece of crap of a movie, definitely not a new look at anything!",Suicide Squad
780,DarylKMiddlebrook,"Suicide Squad: Bad Guys or Nice Guys, I'm Confused?",5,10 August 2016,"Warner brother's Suicide Squad hit the theaters this past weekend and to say I was enthusiastically anticipating this film would be putting it lightly. After all the Avengers assembling, Guardians of the Galaxy guarding and Fantastic Four flopping, I was ready for a super hero film a little on the opaque side. The Dark Knight seemed years ago, and after the disappointment of Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, I just had the feeling DC was going to get this one right. I was wrong.Before I get into everything that's wrong with Suicide Squad, let's cover what's right about this movie. Thumbs up number one: Will Smith. It's been a long time since the old ""Big Willy"" from the Independence Day and Bad Boys days has been on screen, but it was good to see that Will still has some street swagger left in him. His Deadshot is just the right mixture of gangster bravado mixed with family sentimentality to make him a likable man whose life work just happens to be murdering people.The scene stealer in this movie however, is Margot Robbie. Everything that's this film was suppose to be is summed up in her part as Harley Quinn. She's messed up in the head, but she's really very intelligent. She is in love, but it's fatalistic. She's crazy, but insanely beautiful, a serious paradox for most men to grasp and she uses that as her ace in the hole brilliantly. Now, what's wrong with Suicide Squad; it's too nice. This movie should be the super hero version of Apocalypse Now, and it actually starts off like that's what the audience is going to get. We're introduced first to Amanda Waller (played by the always perfect Viola Davis). She's conceived a plan to protect the people of Earth from Superman type meta-humans who don't share the big guy's love for the planet. She wants a team of some of the worst criminals on the planet, expendables, who if they can't repel these super threats, then they die in the process, and no one will care. The trip through the mega-maximum security prison where Waller's Suicide Squad will be drafted is the best part of the movie. With an awesome shadowy soundtrack featuring the likes of The Animal's House of the Rising Sun and the Stones' Sympathy for the Devil, we get a grand tour of the facility and see the atrocious and inhumane way that these meta-menaces to society are held captive. Beaten, prodded, electrocuted and starved this should guarantee that a healthy dose of hate and rage towards the system has been installed in each of Waller's chosen few. But that doesn't happen.Instead, these heinous criminal, once taken from their respective cages and dungeon pits, and put together for the first time, and get along better than a jamboree of boy scouts. I kid you not, this psychotic group of low lives jell together better than the Avengers, X-Men and Fantastic Four combined. And for this type of movie, that's not a good thing. There is no internal fighting, no trying to be the top guy, no indignity of being told what to do. When they find out that the mission they thought they were on was bogus, do they tear up the city? No, they just take it in stride and even buddy up with Colonel Flagg (the unimpressive Joel Kinnaman), the man who has lied to them and threaten to kill them if they don't cooperate.The jovial ""cheerfulness's of this ""Suicide Squad"" is symptomatic of this movie's problems. Nothing works the way it should beginning with Jared Leto's Joker. Leto's take on the pasty- faced madman isn't bad as much as it's misplaced. His story and involvement with Harley Quinn seem to be some kind of ""bonus movie"" added to this film to give it some extra spice. Unfortunately, it just adds to the confusion. The film's focal villain, The Enchantress (the equally unimpressive Cara Delevingne), may be the worst super villain since Richard Pryor's Gus Gorman in Superman III back in the day. The totally unbelievable love story between The Enchantress' alter ego, Dr. June Moone and Colonel Flagg is completely forgotten when the movie hit's its anti-climatic ending (which is a second rate CGI rip-off of the Avengers). While Smith and Robbie give top-notch performances, the rest of the cast just seem to be there marking time, ready to give whatever uninteresting scrap of dialog they've been tossed to fill screen time.Writer/Director David Ayer, who successfully pulled off such grim thrillers as Training Day, and Fury, appeared to be a great choice for making DC's first gritty super hero film outside the Batman trilogy. However, he seriously drops the ball on this one. This isn't the grim, anti-hero vessel we were promised. This is just a cookie-cuter super hero film with no substance; no cohesiveness and nothing left to savior once the credits begin to roll. The cinematography was spot on and it appeared that DP Roman Vasyanov followed his own vision about how this film should look despite what was happening with the script and direction. Overall, Suicide Squad fails to deliver in much the same way that Batman Vs. Superman hit the wall. Both film seemed to lack vision or direction and didn't do enough to take advantage of potentially powerful and fascinating characters. What should have been DC's finest hour turned out to be nothing more than a big fat lie wrapped in a pretty box.",Suicide Squad
781,tinjo23,"Oh boy, where to start.",5,4 August 2016,"For what is shown, it's solidly, okay. But among this mess of a blockbuster actually lies a descent story (in the first half at least) and neither the studio nor director Ayers, seem interested in exploring any of it. The Joker and Harley Quinns relationship, for example, is all show no tell. Why does she love him? Why does he love her? Because they're both insane, isn't an answer.It's not just those two love sick puppies whose characters get butchered by the power of editing, either. Everyone's back stories and motivations (the most interesting part of the movie) are made second (sometimes third) to a by-the-numbers 'defeat the bad guy' plot line. Only Smith's Deadshot gets any real screen time to offer reason to why he'd want to the save the world. The only problem is his character ark undercurrents 'Squads' entire central theme. These are suppose to be the bad guys right?What acting chops are shown off from the cast (and surprisingly, they're mostly pretty solid) are all but wasted on a film too concerned with getting to the finish before it's even begun. The DCCU has all but hit bottom this year, giving a real perspective to why some people really hate comic-book movies. I'd say, come 2017, proceed with caution WB, but I'm pretty sure that's what's gotten you into this mess.",Suicide Squad
782,Sooner_88,Not as bad as you think.,5,10 May 2017,"DC movies get a bad rap in today's movie market. When Marvel has won over the majority of peoples taste and perception, I feel a bias can be made from the ""to like one you have to dislike the other"" mentality. Is Suicide as awful as they say?No it's not. I enjoyed for what it had to offer. And what it offered to me is an early example of what DC can do if they don't shoot themselves in the foot. I know DC comics. I've read a majority of their titles over the years. The Suicide Squad is a B-list/D-list title for villains. And DC has great villains(hence why Harley/Deadshot/Joker were the selling point). DC has an unlimited amount of content to take from but they seem to hire writers or staff that don't know or obtuse to the library of DC. Now, I'm not going to fanboy over this film. It was flawed in many ways. And the Joker(portrayed by Leto) was completely underused and thrown under the bus. That's not good to do to your talented actor. The editing was choppy, and the sequence somewhere a 3/4th's into the film is random and rushed(edited by a trailer crew).The other problem is the script. Whoever green lit a script that was complete in three weeks, needs to find another profession because that is not ample time to make a good film or any film in general.David Ayer does deserve some credit. His choice of costumes and colors is an upgrade from the dower dry and gray BvS. All in all I enjoyed it... For what it was. Take that for what it is worth.",Suicide Squad

786,erkucz00,A Blast Of A movie,10,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad has been a long awaited movie. It has some big shoes to fill. Coming off of widespread disappointment in BvS, and the difficult task of quickly building a formidable DC universe to catch up with marvel; the odds are stacked against it.Nevertheless, it does very well. It improves upon aspects of BvS that needed work, and still adds its own flair and style making it a brand new product. Will Smith brings a brilliant performance. He plays Deadshot, the token sane person on the team. He juxtaposes excellently with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, who is possibly the best incarnation of that character in any media to date. Gone are the frailty, weak humor, and overemphasized jersey accent. This Harley is a force to be reckoned with, because of her fighting skills, not because of her lackeys. As for Batman and the Joker, their roles are minimal. Jared Leto's performance, is intriguing though, and it is my hope that he will have a role in Batman's solo movie. This movie is very slickly made. Virtually every scene gives you that inner feeling, that just says ""man, this is cool!"". An epic soundtrack paired with various other rock songs set the atmosphere wonderfully. From the opening prison sequence with ""House of the Rising Sun"" playing, to the very end with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" serving as the background for the films aftermath the music always sets the stage perfectly.But the best part of the movie is the action. The majority of it is one long battle. Set in a metropolitan setting, the Squad must make their way to the center of the city to beat the villain creating a giant laser beam in the sky. Nothing new, I know. It's how Ayer deals with it that makes it compelling. While mindless on the surface, the action is extremely involved. You know what is happening, and why its happening. The strategy involved is evident. There's a pretty powerful enemy that needs to be eliminated. Deadshot, and Harley take the Lackey's while El Diablo, Uses his fire powers to take the beast head on. Meanwhile Killer Croc, an amphibian is making his way to a crucial spot where a bomb can be planted in order to neutralize said enemy. Like I said, very interesting to watch. In the end, Suicide Squad is great because it proves that WB can learn. They scrambled to give us what we wanted after the critical failure of BvS. Not everyone will like it, but for anyone who's just looking for a good time, Suicide Squad is a blast.",Suicide Squad
787,Travixius,Message to Warner Brothers....,8,10 August 2016,"Stop showing the best lines and jokes from films in the TRAILER!!! This stuff needs to be a surprise when viewing the actual movie. This film is a victim of two things critically, superhero film fatigue and trailer compression (ie. showing all the best parts in the bloody trailer!) Besides that it is a fantastic film with terrific performances. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie score a touchdown with their portrayals. Yes Leto's Joker is a contemporary version of the Joker, but in DC's revamped universe it works very well. Thematically please tell me how this film fundamentally differs from The Avengers? No it's not an imitation, although Marvel and DC have been shamelessly ripping each other off for 50 years at the newsstands. All superhero team ups are a derivative of the Seven Samurai or the Dirty Dozen anyway. Please stop using RT aggregates to judge films. They are no longer relevant. Go and see Suicide Squad.

788,jpatrick-68632,Goes OK!,8,25 August 2016,"We stepped right out of our comfort zone and went to the movies onnaSaturday and the movie that we saw was SUICIDE SQUAD despite the fact that it has been panned by those who make a living panning stuff. It appeared to be the sort of no-brainer that appeals to us. Given the choice between 'Starship Troopers' and 'Philadelphia' we are unlikely to take the latter path of social empathy.A team of super-doopers is put together in case something bad happens, Superman being, it appears, no longer an option. Batman is still around I think but I might've missed his death. The team has all the bases covered with the standout being a perkily-buttocked Harley Quinn who is played by an Australian but sounds American. There is an Australian squadee called 'Captain Boomerang' (Jesus wept!) who sounds like an American playing an Australian but is played by 'Jai' someone or other and as Jai is a name much favoured by bogans he might well have been an Australian. Anyway he's not much chop.The Joker is also in it and he goes OK too. Not as good as the Heathster, but runs a respectable second and he rogers Harley after giving her an acid bath.The squad is put together by ominous CIA type who is not a prisoner taker. Think Bronwyn Bishop with less mercury applied. Lee Lin Chin was BORN for this role.It being a super hero movie a disaster-with-villain is essential. This takes the form of an ancient enchantress and her dodgy brother who decide to destroy the world. Mind you they do have some justification. We've nicked her heart and implanted her into a love interest for a special forces guy. There is always a Special Forces guy. Enchantress is hot but a bad dancer. She doesn't look her age.There are lumpy-headed zombie thingies and a tattooed torch with guilt issues. There is a Deadshot freshie from Bel-Air, and a native American warrior who, in keeping with the pilgrimcentric idea of Americana, is shifty and killed early. There is a big guy with bad skin and pointy teeth. He takes his shirt off but is unlikely to attract the attention of Tarzan who apparently had a 'V' which sends womenfolk into a girl-frenzy. REAL men, and I consider myself one, do not have a 'V'. We have a 'Q' And there is a soundtrack! Creedence, Leslie Gore, Norman Greenbaum, Rolling Stones, Queen and Black Sabbath. Eric Burdon and AckaDacka (ruined by Captain Boomerang). And SWEET. And these are just the ones I remember! It is Tarantinoesque and it was worth the seniors admission just to listen to it. We shall buy the soundtrack.Is it any good? Depends on what you want to compare it to. Ghostbusters? Tarzan? Seen 'em both and it's much more better. There are some funny bits and some serious bits but they might've just been poorly written funny bits.",Suicide Squad
789,notafanof,Embarrassing,2,16 August 2016,"I was once excited to see what Mr.Ayer could do with Suicide Squad and the immense amount of talent it had on board. I was a young boy in those days and the sunset was just a bit more golden. David Ayer is a good director- which is why I was surprised at how atrocious this movie was. I don't entirely blame Mr. Ayer for this film though, as it seems the editors were in a competition to see how many scenes they could cut out. Not a single scene in this film flows into another. All the scenes are slapped next to each other seemingly without any thought. The pacing is completely off in this movie as well. The first act is a half hour introductory sequence that only half develops three of the seven main characters, and the next hour and and a half is a messy action sequence in a city at night. Dead shot and Harley Quinn are pretty much the only two characters in this movie that are interesting- all the other characters are either undeveloped, unsympathetic, or only have 4 lines of dialogue. Leto's Joker is barely in this film, and that is a good thing. The worst joker portrayal I have seen in film or television. A cringe worthy effort in a terrible film. 2 out of 10.",Suicide Squad
790,dreenphlanger,Just another average movie,5,14 April 2017,"Up 'till now, I guess we all got used to the fact that today's superhero movies are not so super as they are supposed to be. Moreover, they are rather average, just like this one.The acting crew of Suicide Squad is pretty good and they depict their characters pretty good (although Killer Croc should be twice bigger). But that was of little help to this movie, since it practically drowned in the mess of its own story.The movie begins quite slowly. Then, out of a sudden, the plot begins quite accidentally and develops so fast (and without adequate explanation) that it disrupts the pace, making you wonder what happened. Then the story develops into constant not-so-special action with average CGI, overall inconsistency, lame jokes and cliché wisecracks. To me, the very idea of the plot was odd and uninventive.Character development is unevenly performed. There are two main characters who simply overshadowed other seemingly important characters. To somehow fix that, the producers frequently inserted unnecessary and pointless dialogues between the action scenes. To no avail. The supporting characters remained shallow and, for the most part of the movie, utterly useless.Still, this movie is watchable, but don't expect anything special. If you like the Suicide Squad from the comics, the animated movie Batman: Assault on Arkham is far better exemplar.",Suicide Squad

792,mjsmjs-46362,"disappointing, shabby mess",3,18 June 2017,"I'll state up front I'm not a huge superhero movie fan. I will watch em if I think they are going to be good and entertaining. Having said that, there are a few superhero movies that pass the sniff test and qualify as great movies. I enjoyed the earlier ""Spiderman"" movies before they spun too deeply into the realm of fanboy absurdity. I thought ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was an extremely well done and entertaining movie, loved it. ""Deadpool"" was a lot of fun, as was ""Hellboy"". Tim Burton's Batman is the crown jewel of superhero movies as far as I'm concerned, and it's the benchmark by which I judge the others by. ""The Dark Knight"" was pretty good (in spite of Bale's laughably pathetic portrayal of Batman) due mainly to a very strong supporting cast, including an amazing performance of The Joker by the late Heath Ledger.I really wanted to like Suicide Squad. Initially, it sounded to me like it might be a fresh take on a tired, worn down and clichéd genre. And really, it did have the potential to be a very good, if not great, superhero movie. Wrong. This film suffered from so many different things I really don't know where to start.Casting....this movie is a casting nightmare, period. The only, and I mean only character that was cast well was Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie delivered a solid, believable performance and she did do a good job with the garbage she was given to work with. She carries every scene she's in, and her performance was the only reason I didn't simply stop watching the movie. Will Smith delivered a weak performance in a role he wasn't well suited at all to play. He came across as a blend between Hancock and his character from ""I am Legend"". They couldn't have picked a worse person to play this role. Which brings me to Jared Leto. There aren't many actors that can pull off the complex role of The Joker convincingly. Nope, Leto isn't on that list. He came across as nothing more than a creepy, disgusting thug...The Joker is so much more than that. He brought absolutely none of the intangibles, depth or complexity it takes to pull off that particular role. And the makeup...wow...it looked like little more than a rushed Halloween costume. Thankfully his role in the movie was mercifully small and his scenes were short. In spite of this he still managed to ruin the character of The Joker for all practical purposes. The rest of the characters I won't even mention, there were far too many of them to even try to pay attention to or care about....which leads us to...The storyline/plot. Bad. period. Its essentially a cheap ripoff of the basic plot line of ""The Dirty Dozen"", except the Suicide Squad version doesn't work at all. Way too much going on with way too many shallow characters. It appeared that as they were writing it and ran into blocks or couldn't come up with a good idea, they simply threw a new minor superhero character in there as a distraction. More is better, right? In this case, no....this would have been a far better movie if they had picked three or four characters to focus on and gone from there. Maybe they felt like none of the major characters were solid enough to carry the movie so they made up for that by adding every minor and uninteresting comic character they could come up with. Aside from cliché flashback scenes, character development of the major players is virtually non existent. And they have so many of them you simply stop caring about any of them. By the end of the movie, I didn't care if they won or lost, who lived or died, I just wanted it to be over.Overall, aside from a few decent Harley Quinn scenes, there is little of watchable or entertaining quality here, unlikely to appeal to any but the most hardcore superhero fanboys. It's a shame really, it did have the potential to be a really good movie,but it's just way too flawed on on way too many levels. Skip this one.",Suicide Squad

No one really knew what kind of response he wants when put in a position of choice.Will Smith although one of the enjoyable characters in the movie didn't really feel like a Deadshot to me.They smoothed it all in nicely with the odd jolt here and there.I'm not going to write too much as its early days and there are probably lots of people waiting to go see it who are skimming through reviews.,Suicide Squad
799,melcraig204,"Watch the trailer, Forget the Movie",3,7 August 2016,"Here we go! Another DC cinematic universe movie pooped out to make nothing but money. Yes WB don't want your respect just your cash. But they are to lazy and or stupid to work out how to do it. A great director and stellar cast are let down (again) by pathetic WB management's decision to cut the guts out of a movie in a knee jerk reaction to Batman v Superman being a T&rd. Is this better that Batman v Superman? No not really. It's more colorful but it's just plain badly put together. Here we have some of DC's baddest bad guys doing the dirty work but wait. They all have hearts of gold and by the end of the movie become super-friends fighting the most generic villain you could ever get. DC/WB if you just focused on making good movies and not building words and franchises you's be a lot better off. Make the good movies. People will want to see them, the shared universe comes later. F%&king idiots.",Suicide Squad

801,CarlinaHoratio,Loved it.,8,25 September 2018,"Watched Suicide Squad with my girlfriend and really enjoyed it, when we returned home to world was on fire and we did not know why. Social media, news outlets, chatter on the streets said Suicide Squad was the worst movie since movies. I asked my girlfriend why all the hate, and she is really smart said ""they only know how to hate, that is our culture."" Also I believe most of the reviews are from child like minds, most of the keyboards that are being pressed upon are purchased by mommy and daddy, they even think the electricity is free.",Suicide Squad
802,adlion94,"Liked it, but with reservations",6,31 October 2016,"I am frankly growing tired of superhero movies (and CGI action movies in general). Same plot over and over. World ending weapon, lots of energy beams, CGI, martial arts, buildings shattering, easily defeated henchmen, countdown clock, conflicted hero. Just STOP.I thought Suicide Squad would be the tonic. It was okay. It kept my attention. But it was flawed, just in different ways from most other superhero movies.First, the plot makes sense - a team of ""controllable"" meta humans, not like that aloof Superman guy to meet the next incredible foe. Except these aren't meta humans. Only Diablo is. The star is really good at shooting guns and the next biggest personality is a girl with a baseball bat. Not exactly defense against Superman or Doomsday.I liked Waller, and Will Smith brought some life to the film. It was colorful and interesting. But just too uneven. The plot made very little sense. I don't understand why a 7,000 year old witch is terrorizing a US city. I don't get her motive. Don't get her brother with the whippy arms. I don't get why bullets and intense flames don't hurt him, but an explosion kills him. Isn't an explosion the combination of projectiles and intense heat? I don't understand the blackberry headed minions who go down easier than LOTR orcs. I guess I just felt like the villain was ill-chosen. In fact, I thought Enchantress was a member of the squad for a good portion of the movie. She seemed to be more powerful than Superman because he wouldn't be able to punch his way out of a fight with her since she's made of smoke. I don't understand why her heart was in a metal briefcase and why she just couldn't teleport to where Waller was and steal back her heart anytime she wanted.Anyway, I still had a bit of fun watching this. I would take this over the Thor and Captain A origin movies any day. I just don't know how long this superhero thing can go on. I think the same thing is about to happen to Star Wars. I'll betcha Rogue One is a turkey, but that's a review for another day.Suicide Squad is entertaining, but you'll finish the film feeling like a huge opportunity was missed.",Suicide Squad
803,SindarS,Another example of a terrible DC movie,4,28 June 2020,"So the premise of the movie is - when there are no superheroes left (namely, Superman) to save/protect the world, we should assemble a team of hot-headed bad guys to do the job. Just inject them with an explosive tracking device and we're set - what can go wrong, right?
Oh, and apparently you just need a smartphone app to blow their heads off that you occasionally wave in their face to motivate them.While the cast of the movie includes some prominent well-known names, the ensemble of their characters just doesn't work because of the poor writing.The whole saga can be encapsulated within a few points:
storyline, plot - nonsensical and barely any to speak of;characters - borrowed from a stash of stereotypical anti-heroes, also no development of their story-archs (a few flashback scenes at random times doesn't cut it);dialogues - almost unbearable and filled with one-liner clichés;Harley-Joker love (?) saga included just because we needed some weird abusive romance in this mess as well?soundtrack - feels more like a mix-tape of songs that play at random times without any regard to what happens on the screen.All that combined amounts to an epic disaster, which to me felt more like a parody of a movie; or rather several movie trailers and teasers stitched together.So until DC gets their act together and work on a coherent storyline in their Universe, this disaster won't be their last.",Suicide Squad
804,alexarag,Simply Not That Interesting,5,12 August 2016,"Is this movie terrible? Absolutely notIs this movie great? Absolutely not.I always heard from people that they either HATED or LOVED this movie. And for me it was neither.The audience for this film is served with a classic action movie/comic book. ""The world is in danger! There must be a solution! Although there are bumps between the characters along the way, eventually, we'll solve the problem""The interesting twist is *supposed* to be that instead of classic superheroes, we have bad guys. To that I say ""so what?"". The movie didn't really establish why I should care about much of what was going on on screen—it was all just classic popcorn movie action and sequences that were occasionally broken up by half-attempts at character development.",Suicide Squad
805,onionbagel,DC's Guardians of the Galaxy!,9,6 August 2016,"I don't know why the critics are hating on this awesome movie, and I can't fathom them (Rotten Tomatoes) giving it the same score as BVS (which ACTUALLY was terrible)! Suicide Squad was a fun movie, just like Guardians of the Galaxy. That's the best way I can describe it, is FUN!If you've read any of the Suicide Squad comics or at least watched the TV show Arrow, you know that the suicide squad is a bunch of ""bad guys"" who are given the opportunity to do something good.The movie is very funny, light hearted and action packed. What I think I liked most though (aside from the star of the show Harley Quinn) is that the trailer DID NOT spoil everything! I won't spoil anything either, but let's just say that who the trailers lead you to believe the ""villain"" is (The Joker), isn't actually the villain.*****I put villain in quotes because they're all bad guys obviously, but someone has to be THE ""villain"" in the movie.***** I was a little disappointed that the Joker wasn't in the movie more, but at least they threw us a curve ball by making us think he was the ""villain"" when in fact he was kind of off doing his own thing.FINAL VERDICT: Suicide Squad will appeal to anyone who loves action OR comedy. If you Liked Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, Deadpool, etc, (AND YOU'RE NOT A CRITIC) you will love this movie! PS - Jared Leto's Joker was good, but still not better than Heath Ledger's (unbeatable) performance. I also think though, that since the Joker wasn't in this movie much, that no-one can accurately judge Jared's Joker until he's in another movie like Suicide Squad 2 (this movie was left WIDE open for a sequel) or maybe the Harley Quinn movie.",Suicide Squad
806,RageQuitLeigh,Unfortunately the core of this movie fails likes many DC movies before at the balance of power,7,14 December 2020,"Unfortunately the core of this movie fails likes many DC movies before at the balance of power and ability of different characters, which renders the believability null and void.On the face of it Suicide Squad provides us with a well cast and acted film, great looking spectacle (apart from design of Killer Croc and the effects of the hovering and glowing Doctor in the final third) and some decent sound bites as well as a very modern take on soundtracking which for the most part in this type pf movie works well.However the way the bad guy is weakly introduced (why did she snap the head off the figure in the cave? makes no sense) and her relationship with flag, doesn't give us anything to care for.The biggest issue for me is the balance of power between the characters. We have an all powerful god capable of creating an army and tearing the world apart and she's outfoxed by a group of criminals who whilst are exceptional and crazy do not have superpowers. It makes no sense. Every scene with the enchantress is the weakest part of the movie.I personally feels had the bad guy been more down to earth a real gem of a movie could have been made, that being said it is watchable and entertaining, just disappointing.",Suicide Squad
807,meezerfan123,Horrible edit but some intense and compelling performances,8,28 February 2017,"I have to still give it an 8 because Robbie, Leto, Hernandez and Smith are absolutely at the top of their mutual games here.Margot Robbie could not be more spot-on as Harley Quinn. She has the physical look to match the character and obviously spent a lot of time getting the mannerisms and personality just right. She's athletic and did most of her own stunts in the movie, including a particularly frightening long underwater scene.Jared Leto is the only Joker I've ever seen that I found compelling - but I'm a woman. I understand why the overgrown fanboys don't particularly care for sexy gangster Joker, but every woman I know thought he was smoking hot in the role. Leto has aaaaahmazing chemistry with Robbie and if D.C. has the good sense to focus a movie on their Joker & Harley Quinn, all I can say is, take my money.Will Smith's portrayal of a cold blooded professional hit-man who cares about one thing - his young daughter - is equally exceptional. It's hard to think of a bad guy no matter what he's done because of the humanity and vulnerability he brings to the role. He did a great job without having a lot to work with script-wise.Viola Davis is an excellent villain in this. She's everything that has ever been wrong with the government and she really makes you relate to the so-called criminals who are at her mercy.Finally, Jay Hernandez is terrific as a villain trying not to use his highly destructive superpowers. He knocked it out of the ballpark. I would love to see more of his backstory in Suicide Squad 2. For that matter, I'd watch a whole movie about the character.The Enchantress plot is weak and, quite frankly, boring. Kinnaman and Delavigne have zero chemistry so you don't care about their relationship, which might have made it a lot more interesting. Some characters are just filler (Captain Boomerang, Katana, Slipknot - who cares?) The biggest problem is that they sliced and diced this movie to the point where a lot of it makes no sense. It looks like it was edited by a chimp. The extended cut is MUCH better but I wish they'd release a full version with everything they actually filmed.The sequel is coming so hopefully WB/DC can do better this time. Give us a lot more of the Joker and Harley relationship - those two are scorching hot together! - and definitely more Smith and Hernandez in their roles. Don't sacrifice backstory and character development for action. Half your audience is women - you can't just blow stuff up and expect us to be into it. You've got some amazing actors here, so use them!",Suicide Squad
808,toffee-39398,Underrated,7,6 December 2020,"This film feels like it's being directed by a kid who watches a lot of super hero films but I think that's what makes it to me stand out from many of the other dc films. There are some ways I can prove this here is an example. They do a short scene telling us all about the squad and what they specialise. But then out of nowhere in the last three seconds before the heist is about to begin they throw in this guy who can climb walls who dies before he even gets to fight any enemy's
. Another thing about this film is that if the filmmakers had just kept this a normal heist and didn't add in this extremely bad villain who wants to take over the world an is a witch with bad graphics and just no need for it. Also the film needed more development on the characters as I felt like by the end I didn't fully understand them.Even after all those faults I feel that people should still give this film a chance as it is actually great and like I've said for my title of this review it is extremely underrated and not appreciated as much as it should be.",Suicide Squad

Then Cristopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and latest Marvel Movies made me change my mind. And now this Movie with a great trailer, great cast, including Margot Maggie, that results just like a huge disappointment at the end. The Movie plot is messy, dialogues are embarrassing, some characters really don't work and others are a total non sense. According to the their last productions, they must have a big problem at WB finding new talented directors and writers. For their own good, I hope they resolve it soon before it's too late.",Suicide Squad
812,jlcdrama,What movie did the critics see?,10,4 August 2016,"I first go excited for this movie with the trailers. The buzz was great, but the negative reviews from the critics surprised me. Out of all of the superhero/comic movies out there, this one looked different? Why the sudden negativity. Still, I decided to catch the 6 pm early showing of it.I'm left wondering what film all the critics saw because the one I just walked out of was awesome!I go to movies looking looking for one thing: entertainment. Boy did this one deliver.The actors were amazing. I was already impressed by Jared Leto from the trailers and he did not disappoint. Some say he wasn't in the film enough, however, this isn't about the Joker. I think Waller would agree, Joker would never be able to join the Suicide Squad. However, what scenes he is in are great, he really shines. I felt like he was in there just enough for him to be interesting and totally thrilling, but it also left me dying to see him front in center of his own movie. You can tell they have Joker in here as a teaser for for more to come with him.Magot Robbie was fantastic as Harley Quinn. Out of all of the Squad, I found myself feeling her emotions. You really got to know Harley in this film. I would love to see her and Joker together in another film. Will Smith was great as Deadshot. Sure, we've seen Will be the sarcastic, fun sort of hero (or I suppose sort of hero in this film) before, but he plays the role well. It certainly was interesting knowing he is not so much a superhero as he is a reluctant antihero with crack shot skills.The actor that most surprised me was Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. Now I thought she looked good in the trailers, but her character was one I didn't have much interest in. Boy did that change. You found yourself sitting up straighter when she was on screen. She is scary in her own way, and despite the fact she's one of the ""good guys"" you certainly don't trust her and you really don't want to get on her bad side.Now with all movies, this one does have it's flaws. The girl who plays Deadshot's daughter is perhaps the weakest actor of the crew, but she's not in the film much so that's very minor. The villain's motive is rather typical ""take over the world"" sort of thing, but that's true with most villain in superhero movies and even in comics.The flashbacks were all great. Some came bit later in the film, but that only was to better enhance the emotions of the characters. For the first time, you were really connecting with crazy psychopaths and killers in a superhero movie.Bottom line, don't listen to the critics. If you want a movie that wants to entertain you with really great actors, awesome action, and even surprise you with some feels, then you will love this movie.",Suicide Squad
813,Stoomkracht,A mess that doesnt match Batman universe,2,26 October 2019,"First, its way too long. The first half+ hour is spoiled on a very basic setup of the characters you really cant care about. Quick forced background stories in your face for each. An unrealistic story about using a bunch of criminals to counter other villains. Then theres the superhero/supernatural/way over the top stuff that has no place in a more down to earth Batman universe imho. The main story is just very simple and lame. Another evil alter-ego wants to conquer the world for no given reason. O quite a few vehicle crashes in this movie where everyone steps out alive with no injuries. Also a few unexplained returns from meeting dead. The characters dont match with each other. Mere mortals combined with very powerful god like characters. Somehow it still got a part 2?",Suicide Squad
814,falynsoul,Enjoyable but has some notable flaws.,4,6 August 2016,"I'm honestly not sure how I'm supposed to feel about this movie. There are a lot of 'huh' moments and 'why the f*** would they do that'. It seems as if DC wanted us to root for the SS and the villains rather than the 'good guys'. Overall I'd say this is a mixed bag and your priorities when going to see the film will determine whether you enjoy yourself or not. Pros: Deadshot and Harley Quinn back-stories, overall performances from the cast. Interactions between the characters was great and resulted in some hilarious moments. Villains were pretty decent.Cons: Cheap looking CGI, some jokes fell through, some corny dialogue. Some characters were sidelined and really underused. Soundtrack got in the way of some scenes-- too loud.I feel like a broken record saying this again, but I just feel confused. Its a super-mixed bag.

815,kieronboote-134-969472,A shame ..........in both senses of the word.,4,17 August 2016,"""Watchmen"" was a respectable film adaptation of perhaps the greatest comic book and along with ""Kick Ass"" made the first moves towards a more adult orientated adaptation of a comic book. The first ""Iron Man"" movie (the horrible simpering Gwyneth Paltrow aside) was a terrific comic book adaptation that along with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" showed just how much undiluted fun comic book films could be. Then ""Deadpool"" ramped up everyone's expectations of what could be delivered in a comic book adaptation. ""Suicide Squad"", if delivered properly, could have been the next step in liberating comic book adaptations from the world of cliché and the low expectations of the lowest common denominator consumer market. But sadly the film is a badly scripted and pedestrianly directed failure.What should have been a surrealistic kaleidoscope of chaotic, sexy violence is reduced to a tedious ""buddy cop"" type movie bonding between the characters of Flagg and Deadshot. Meanwhile the only real successes of the film, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Jared Leto's ""Joker"", are reduced to occasional side show carnival acts. Harley objectified and only justified psychologically as the Joker's lesser half which denies much of the complexity of the original character. The opportunities for caustic comedy dialogue are missed at almost every turn by the witless script which shows no respect for the intelligence of the audience or craftsmanship in its execution.Unimaginative direction reduces the film to head shot reactions of the various squad members and very obviously staged medium shot soap opera action scenes – there's certainly nothing here to match the violent poetry and brilliant editing of the opening bridge scene in ""Deadpool"". The scene where ""Deadshot"" single-handedly and with lethal precision takes out the horde of rather uninspired pimple creatures could have been jaw dropping but in the hands of Ayer is reduced to formulaic blandly edited mediocrity.The basic structure of the film falls into two halves. The first is the inevitable and drawn out series of montages describing the origins of the Squad members. Not very well assembled and here, as throughout the film, the makers fail to make a clear decision on how to assign time to the various team members. We then we move into the second half with the core narrative during which the squad take on the character of The Enchantress and her Brother. The motivations and reasoning behind this conflict are muddled and there is no tension because we do not know properly what threat the ""enemy"" represent. There is no philosophical or ideological differences between the combatants so it's all just a performing puppet show staged between people we don't care about and there is no explanation as to why someone who has existed for 4,000+ years suddenly decides to act at this precise moment. As the film then plods along to it's inevitable conclusion we are reduced to something that closely approximates a poor copy of the original ""Ghostbusters"" movie, swirling tacky pyro-techniques above a tall building and a pay off of the ""love interest"" Cara Delevigne, pretty underwhelming in her central performance I'm afraid, being discovered, just like Sigourney Weaver in ""Ghostbusters"", inside the crust of a dead creature.I feel very sorry for Margot Robbie and Jared Leto because clearly they both tried their best to invest their characters with the inhabited personality and conviction that they need to bring Harley Quinn and the Joker to life but they may as well have been in another movie to the lumpen action tedium surrounding them. The scene showing Harley's fantasy ideal as being the life of a little housewife locked away in her own kitchen with a couple of kids shows the essentially reactionary nature of this movie, and is consistent with the largely negative representation of women in the rest of Ayer's output. Thus we are asked to believe that someone who started out as an intelligent medical professional, challenged by the idea of chaos and who was drawn to the complexities of the Joker's personality and who then transforms into a sexy super killing machine really only longs for bland domesticity?There are so many plot, motivation and character holes in the film that it comes across as being made up as it goes along. For example the head of the project Amanda Walker, played by Viola Davis in a thankless role, engages in many ruthless acts throughout the film such as cold heartedly shooting and killing her own FBI agents but then for no real reason allows Deadshot time off to visit his daughter - which bizarrely morphs into being yet another tedious bonding moment between Flagg and Deadshot rather than between Deadshot and his daughter!The box office may be the end that justifies the means for the clowns in suits who clearly felt this was adequate for public consumption but I'm afraid I don't like to be treated as if I'm stupid and I hate ""by the numbers"" consumer film making so I won't be returning for another episode of ""Suicide Squad"" unless the studio execs consign Mr Ayer back to the dumb macho movies that his CV is best suited to and then plead with the team behind ""Deadpool"" to get involved. But then whilst the cinema going public are all wasting their money on a lazily put together mess like this why would Warner Brothers bother to try and make an interesting, thought provoking quality film? Keep the masses sedated like the inmates of Arkham Asylum!",Suicide Squad

818,timothyalanwilliams,"""Suicide Squad"" is Fast and Fun But Could Have Been Better",7,8 August 2016,"""Suicide Squad"" is the pseudo-sequel to ""Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice"". This story takes place sometime after the events of that epic superhero showdown which ultimately sets up the ""need"" for the unique collection of these ""bad guys"" who have been locked up thanks to Batman and the Flash. The tone of this film is very dark. Much darker than ""Dawn of Justice"" and often feels off-kilter (which I'm sure was intentional). The writers were wise to keep the dialogue and banter between the squad quick-witted and funny. Otherwise the dark tone could have weighed down the pace of the film and took away the empathy we needed to root for the ""bad guys"". With any ensemble film like this one the story tends to miss having any real depth for the characters. Thanks to good back stories at the beginning, we are immediately introduced to Deadshot (played by Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie). The rest of the squad become mere by-standers through much of the movie (until Diablo played by Jay Hernandez shares his story midway through the movie). Even though the film clocks in at 2 hours I felt that it could have taken more time to develop. But with such lukewarm reviews from ""Dawn of Justice"" I think the studio wanted a faster- paced film with this one (which Director David Ayers has confirmed in interviews lately). Of course the Joker (played by Jared Leto) needed no backstory, but his role in the film felt like it was just there for the fans (much like Wolverine's cameo in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"") However, the Joker is vital to Harley Quinn's backstory. But beyond that he doesn't do much to move the story along. I believe he was there to help set up a Harley Quinn stand alone movie in the future. Leto's performance was good but it will never touch Heath Ledger's hypnotic portrayal from ""The Dark Night"". The stand out performance for me goes to Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the mastermind (and ultimate nemesis) of the squad. You've never seen Ms. Davis this sinister or this cold hearted (and you might just like it!) Overall, ""Suicide Squad"" is a fun and enjoyable action-comedy flick. But it suffers from being a late-Summer release. After seeing ""Dawn of Justice"", ""Civil War"", and ""Apocalypse"" you get the feeling ""Haven't I seen this before?"" But I will definitely see this squad again! **Be sure to stay for the credits to see an extra scene**",Suicide Squad
819,omar-alikaj,A Welcomed Addition to the DC Universe,8,8 August 2016,"I managed to find the time to watch ""Suicide Squad"" last Saturday, and it turns out to be a really good addition to the DC Universe that both DC Comics and Warner Bros. want to show to movie goers.""Suicide Squad"" is actually a sequel to ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice"". With the apparent death of Superman, Amanda Waller (played by Viola Davis) plots to make use of the services of Gotham City's worst villains, and random criminals, in captivity, in order to fight off potential threats. It did make some of us wonder how dumb she could be not to talk to Batman, as she did in having Will Smith's character, Deadshot, arrested, but it became clearer when the guys were warned that the bombs embedded in their necks would blow their heads off, i.e. if they try and do anything funny.That's fine that villains were made to fight villains here, except that a mortal lady, June Moone (played by Cara Delevingne), had a misfortune of coming in contact with an evil spirit in a cave. Thus, like Steven Spielberg's ""Freakazoid"", saying a phrase causes her to transform into someone else, the ""Enchantress""... not to be confused with Marvel's Enchantress. The Enchantress' an ancient witch turned outcast by ex-worshippers of the past. Still bitter at humanity, even centuries later, this two-face (""two-face"" because she was originally helping Waller) and her brother, whose spirit possessed another unfortunate soul, secretly plotted till they were able to create an army to decimate Gotham. The brother even disturbed some movie goers by killing off random people, while fusing with a train he destroyed, in order to transform into a demonic overlord. With all that being said, little did Suicide Squad know was that they were assigned to fight ""super villains"".At the climax, I liked that the transformed Enchantress gave the members of Suicide Squad visions of those brighter futures that she claimed she could grant, if they help her take over the world, and one of the members, ""Diablo"", who had a dark past of killing off his wife and kids with arson, dismissed the visions as ""aren't real"". A bit predictable, but liked how they were used here, the action scenes, or that she tried to stop Deadshot with a vision of his daughter begging him to put his guns away. I recommend you sit through the climax to see how things unfold.I also like that the film was re-shot to be less moody, and funny, giving it its own flavor. With the ""Batman Vs. Superman"" backlashes, DC and Warner Bros. thought of taking a break from the dark tone. Even on Facebook, we all were worried that the studio didn't know what sort of DC Universe films they wanted to produce to their fans anymore. At the end, at least with the audience I sat with, we laughed every two to ten minutes in certain parts of the movie.When there were serious scenes, like Deadshot losing his daughter, or figuring out why Waller was using them, or even Katana... and WarCraft fans can relate to her and her sword, it did leave a lot of us thinking, since we've grown to liking the characters.Of course, the movie isn't too perfect. The worst part of it has to be Jared Leto's Joker. He's a side character that goes around... with men in costumes... shooting people, hangs around with Harley Quinn, disappears (or apparently dies), then shows up tens of minutes later to repeat the process. This happened two to three times, and he barely stayed long when compared to the movie's length. Thus, while the movie concentrates on the actual members of Suicide Squad, and the villains, it seems that DC Comics and Warner Bros. were warming up the Joker for a future movie, since this movie ended with him breaking Harley out of prison. Overall, it made the flashbacks of the Joker and Harley needless in ""Suicide Squad""... well maybe except in explaining Harley's origin.Overall, after months of wondering what sort of movie we'd be getting in August, ""Suicide Squad"" is a welcomed addition to the DC Universe. After giving credits to the main actors, and actresses, the movie shows an extra scene of Waller talking to Bruce Wayne, apparently knowing that he and Batman are the same person. They were apparently talking about the Joker's prison break, with Wayne advising her to shut down the Suicide Squad, while he prepares his own team to fight crimes. It was the assurance of a Justice League movie we were glad to sit through before the credits rolled, ending the movie perfectly. This is the other DC Universe movie of 2016 I actually recommend watching.",Suicide Squad
820,Zephrey,"Harley Quinn is hot, but the movies not",6,3 November 2016,"After watching BVS, I was really hoping this would be the game winner for the DCEU, but again another let down. The movie was off to a good start and then the way they introduced all the characters was such a mess, that I was already losing hope before the fight actually started. The thing with the DCEU is that there's no storyline it's only focused on action. The whole movie was basically someone taking DC's most popular characters and putting them in a boxing ring to fight the great evil. And DC fans wonder why marvel does so well, it's that they actually have a story and humour. Most of Suicide Squad was centred around Deadshot (Will Smith), like yes your the most popular actor in the cast put the fact that it was mainly about him was so boring. And the you have Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) a model who can't act at all. She was dancing in the movie!!. You call that a villain are you serious??. DCEU take notes from marvel. Anyways the last main Character was Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) The main reason why half the crowd went to go SS. Horny fanboys. I was so disappointed.",Suicide Squad

822,JustALittleBitRandom,Disappointing for what looked like such a good resurgence for DC,4,8 August 2016,"An American government agency recruits a group of the worlds most dangerous super villains to destroy a huge threat that can only be stopped by this group of people.I was really looking forward to this film. So were many other people. It seems that critics ,not all but a fair majority, haven't been impressed by it. So does DC's newest film look as good as the trailers made it out to be? Unfortunately the answer is no. Suicide Squad is once again ,following on from March's Batman Vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice, disappointing. The film spends the first hour referring back to Batman Vs Superman, building up to next year's Justice League ,which is all Batman Vs Superman did, and introducing characters only to refer back to the points expressed in multiple backstories in constant flashbacks throughout the film. Then when the plot does finally kick in the pace and tone is literally Quiet Quiet Quiet... Enemies... BANG BANG BANG, GUNS GUNS GUNS, SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT, EXPLOSIONS, FLASH FLASH, BANG BANG BANG, KABOOM!!! All ended when a character says something like ""That was fun"" or ""That was crazy"". And while a quick filler scene is happening the crew reset the stage making it look a bit different and then the previous fight scene is done again. Back to the filler scene with the exact same basis then back to a fight and this is literally how the entirety of the entire second half of the film goes. It gets to the point where you've seen it once you've seen all of it you might as well leave because that's the next hour of the film. At certain points the script just seem to focus on the characters of Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) As they seem to be the most explored and developed characters just so you feel for them and so there is something else to show in the filler scenes and this leaves out the rest of the characters out and barely shown. One character that is affected most by this is Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang who stands out when he's actually in a scene and provides most of the small amount of comic relief that the film holds ,so much for re shoots to make the film lighter and funnier. As for Jared Leto's Joker he doesn't seem to do much and isn't as psychotic and twisted as the trailers promised and is as much ,if not more, of a disappointment than the film itself is. He spends most of the film doing things that don't have relevance to the plot and just there to fill in between some scenes so the main team of bad guys can get from one fight scene destination to another. He has no real relevance until one scene that supports the films finale, but unfortunately he's just there for flashbacks and filler as he doesn't really shine and deliver what was hoped. Jared Leto himself has said that most of the Joker's scenes have been cut from the film and this is believable as there does seem to be a lot of him missing and certain scenes he was in might have made more sense if there was more explanation to them, but just like the rest of the film the Joker's story line is a bit of a mess. Once again a film studio needs to learn that lot's of action and fights with millions of dollars of the 175 million dollar budget spent on God knows how much CGI doesn't distract from a clunky plot and a film filled with problems.Unfortunately Suicide Squad was mis-sold to audiences and a fun action packed film turns out to be references and build up to past a future films followed by tedious repetition of the same plot and fight scenes every 15-20 minutes. It's a big disappointment, and possibly more than Batman Vs Superman was.......** <-- Two Stars (Out Of Five)",Suicide Squad

824,DJRumpy,Ignore the critics. You won't regret it,8,6 August 2016,"I'm honestly a bit confused by all the Marvel vs. DC BS that seems to be trashing this movie. I'm not a particular fan of any particular comic. I don't own any comics. I just like good movies. I grew up with X-Men cartoons, and the Super Friends, Spiderman, Green Lantern. I could care less about some nerd rage about who's better. I just want some entertainment and Suicide Squad definitely delivered.I wasn't sure what to expect, other than some cheeky behavior from Harley Quinn, and some nice visuals. What I got was a great summer ride.Don't listen the hype and judge for yourself. Every one of these characters is fleshed out. I connected with each, although a few could have used a bit more back story. The visuals definitely didn't disappoint, and the action was non-stop once you got your ticket on the train ride. After the backstory was out of the way, it was game on.The Joker was 'uncomfortable' to watch, which is saying something. The insanity shown there was truly believable. Harley Quinn excelled as a total wacko, jokester, bad ass, and general flirt. This was oddly probably one of the best renditions of the joker I've seen. Heath Ledger was a believable villain for being cold and critical and deadly in the batman flicks. This Joker is different for a different reason. I wasn't sure Jared was a good choice for this .I left the theater not doubting. The joker and Harley are insane and the in love. The joker is evil, and Harley will do whatever he asks. I great recipe for disaster ;).Deadshot was awe inspiring, and still managed to be likable, and inhumanly human. Will Smith is the perfect mix of 'full of himself', 'a father', 'deadly', and 'plucky' at the same time. He and Harley Quinn had great chemistry on screen.Enchantress was a surprise for me, largely hidden in the previews, and fantastic in it's delivery. They could spawn an entire new movie off of that alone.El Diablo was fantastic as a thug turned spiritual initiate. His power is impressive. I only wish he had more on-screen time, because what they showed was jaw dropping. They should have spread that around a bit.Overall, a solid 8 out of 10. You won't find much better for summer fare. This is one that will have lasting power beyond the summer as well. It will go into my favorites along with Guardians, The Man of Steel, Star Trek, and the Thor films. Great entertainment. Tell the critics to shove it or check their batteries...",Suicide Squad

827,km2442,Solid 5-6 but lots of premise wasted,5,13 August 2016,"It wasn't awful, but I had quite a few issues with this film. The top two things that bothered me were the lack of things the trailer promised while disappointing you on the things it did deliver on. For example: All the funny lines in the trailer are the *only* funny lines in the movie-so you've already heard them and they aren't funny anymore, on the other hand you don't get any of the cool scenes with the joker that you were expecting because they aren't there. SO essentially you get lines that were overused with no new material and then the stuff you wanted to see more of, you don't. I hate when all the funny parts are in the trailer- especially with the funny/action tone of this franchise- it feels like a waste of money and a letdown that the writers had that little creativity to spread around. Second: Harley Quinn was such a disappointment. Her performance was lauded, but another major letdown. I'm actually embarrassed for Margot Robbie since her job was really just to have her ass out and look pretty. She was useless to the plot and it would've been great to see her and the joker's backstory expanded a bit more than bare dialogue flashbacks that don't give you any reason to care about her character. I wasn't too enthused about the Joker's new look, but Leto pulled it off fantastically. He was great. Even with the ridiculously small amount of screen time he had (and really if this was about suicide squad why not leave him out of it and let him have his own film with Harley? There was really that little point to the scenes he had and was in) Jared Leto was the best part of the movie.Another gripe- the plot was messy and characters underdeveloped. You don't really buy in to them being bad guys because the amount of time fleshing out the characters is dismal. And making Waller a harda** didn't disguise that. The idea of making her worse than the so- called bad guys was a mistake. Why wouldn't she just call Batman for help with whatever the f*ck was going on? Duh. There should've been exposition of the characters backstories to feed in to why suicide squad was specifically needed against Enchantress. The plot problems really pulled it apart. And being the introduction to a new franchise, the setup is really important here to get the audience on board- not only comic readers, but new fans. They failed. I really feel like it was Ayer's direction too- since he's stated that this was his ""director's cut."" Ayer being proud of this mess is really damn sad. I went in to this with my husband saying everyone gave it a solid seven. To me that's an average score and this was not a little worse than average. A solid 5, but no more. The waste of potential is too big, not to mention you'd think the studio would've been more involved in screening the 'director's cut' before release after the bomb that was Batman vs Superman. I hope they can pull DC back together. Sad panda on this one.",Suicide Squad
828,fredphoesh,Abysmal predictable rubbish,1,10 August 2016,"WOW! WHAT UTTER RUBBISH!!! Seriously, this is one of the worst action hero movies I have ever seen... nope, it is THE worst. An abysmal insult to the intelligence of an average person. Every move is totally predictable. It is filled with clichés and has absolutely nothing one could say in it's favour. The roles played by the villain heroes were all cardboard cut-outs and you felt you could write their next line before they even spoke it, it was THAT BAD. One becomes so conscious of the contrived, staged nature of this ""badass team"" that you can almost hear the director/hairstylist/set dresser running around just off camera. Suspended belief is usually because a story is so fantastical that you make allowances for the way laws of physics can be broken, and you still become enchanted, wrapped up in a movie that has merit. This movie has none, and the suspended belief I found myself having to constantly endure and overcome was the belief that this was a story worth caring about. So shallow and vacuous is this plot that all you can see is a movie that fails dismally at drawing you in. I did not care at all about the characters, their loved ones, their children... 1/10 is generous.",Suicide Squad

But Robbie made me like the character for the first time ever! - Captain Boomerang - This guy was hilarious! A much different take than the TV version but it worked! - Killer Croc - He came off very intimidating and was oddly hilarious in a very good way - El Diabla - Wow, did not expect to feel so much for this character.

It's nice to be surprised at the movies every now and thenThe Bad - There wasn't much of a story; there is about 30 minutes of setup and the rest is one long action scene (not that that's a problem, but it could have used some fleshing out) - Too many songs and not enough orchestral music - You could really tell the WB editing team took several axe strokes to the movie if the rumors are to be believedMy sheer excitement at seeing this comic realized on-screen though is really enough to help me ignore the films problems9/10 (for now, my opinions on films can change)",Suicide Squad

All characters in this movie are crafted well. Especially the Jokers's character is really very well played by Jared letto. It was ambiguous that no one can ever meet performance of Joker other than heath leadger. But jared has performed that superbly.

831,pantelisandreou98,A big pile of disappointment..,4,13 October 2018,"Rewatched this mess again a couple of days ago and came here to check what grade i gave to it a couple of years ago when i saw it.. and i was surprised to see that i gave it 7 stars.. and i thought.. why?
After seeing it again (why? Indeed) it reminds me how bad a superhero movie can get. Yes, there are far more worse superhero from this one.. but after the huge hype from the amazing trailers they gaveus you kind of feel the disappointment of how truly great this movie could have been.
The movie started promising with the introduction of the characters with the use of great visuals but then it dragged to almost half an hour of exposition and it felt so rushed that they were introducing the one character next to another with scenes that didn't really matched together and it seemed that they were doing it just to get it over with and move to the ""juice"" of the movie..
Now for the plot of the movie. I don't think there's anyone out there who haven't seen this but I won't spoil it anyway.. the plot is a big nothing.. just gather a bunch of bad guys and go from one place to another until they meet the bigger and badder villain.. aand that's it.. unclear and predictable things happen in between those scenes but as a whole it's a big pile of nothing..
Also, the use of music in this movie is the worst use of music i've seen in quite some time. It made the movie feel like a mashup of video clips made for the tv.. you can clearly see and hear in some scenes that they've changed the score in the reshoots so they can lighten up the mood and don't let it get dark (BvS)
The only members from the squad i seem to care was only Harley and Deadshot. They had a handful of good scenes (the birth of Harley Quinn and the tragic backstory of deadshot) not that they were that great in characterization but in comparison with the rest of the characters they had something more. Also i hate to say this but i hated the joker in this.. making the joker like a gangster it just not have that result i was expecting. It surely seems that Jared Leto is doing his best and he is really having a great time but the role of joker in this is really unnecessary.
Overall the movie has a few funny and great scenes here and there and the acting isn't bad and if you really don't care about the plot of the movie you'll probably have a great time. It just makes me so sad of how exceptional this movie could have been if it wasn't for the plot, music and characters.",Suicide Squad
832,calle_2565,Oh! It's cool I guess.,4,4 August 2016,"This movie had potential, it really did, but it just falls on itself and many quips that are SO overdone (for some characters I can understand it, but come on. Millions spent and we get some of the same schlock that Marvel has pumped out for years now). Longer intros than was needed (and some that didn't get one at all, guess what happens to them *wink, wink* *nudge, nudge*) and parts that basically can be seen as over-hyped, short music videos. And Will Smith AS Will Smith?! Get outta town, give that man an Oscar.Yeah, but there are a few good things in this movie. Margot Robbie, great casting right there (a bit on the nose with the comedy like I said before but that's the character). Leto, despite not being in that much leaves an impression; looking forward to see if they do something more with him as the joker. Also Joel Kinnaman plays surprisingly good as Rick Flag. The others are brushed aside by Smith, but hey, he has top billing which makes sense from a marketing perspective, but the majority of the screen time Smith is on it just falls flat. It's not Deadshot you're looking at, it's Will Smith, he makes up for it, somewhat, in the end.A lot of parts are just a copy/paste from any marvel-movie, it tries to play it safe when it should've taken a different route. OH WELL... It's an okay movie, no more, some less. Take some risks DC, you've done it before why not now?...oh right, money.",Suicide Squad
833,Whingewood,"Entertaining comic book action film, well worth watching!",8,9 August 2016,"Going into this film I was already aware of the Suicide Squad. I've had brief glimpses of some of the old and the new squads, and have also seen the animated version (which is definitely worth checking out by the way).So, onto the film. I felt that the pacing was good, as at no point during the film did I feel bored. The story, such as it was, progressed at a good pace and never really gave me a chance to stop and think, which may have been a good thing as it was not overly deep or original. However, this is a comic book film, so I wasn't exactly expecting a highbrow masterpiece in terms of story, but the action scenes were enjoyable and kept the film moving along.The characters were introduced through exposition, which would normally be written off as lazy, but was appropriate in this film in the context it was used. I'm not going to talk about the individual changes to characters compared to the comics as there are always going to be differences; I'll leave that to the fans to bicker about.In my opinion, you were given enough information about each character to get a sense of their motivations and capabilities (very similar amounts to characters in films like The Magnificent Seven and The Dirty Dozen, and you never hear complaints about them). Some people may complain about the number of characters, but those same people won't question the amount in Game of ThronesThe two main characters, Harley Quinn and Deadshot, were both portrayed well by Margot Robbie and Will Smith respectively. You'll probably hear a lot about how little of Jared Leto's Joker was in the film, which people are chalking up as a negative, however, I'd be disinclined to agree. The Joker should never be a main character in a film where Batman is not also the main character, and in this film, Ben Affleck's Batman was hardly present (again, not a negative thing).This film is about Amanda Waller's Task Force X (the Suicide Squad), who was played very well by Viola Davis (Waller is definitely not someone to be messed with), and this film establishes them as 'The Other Guys'; the ones you call when the Justice League are too busy, and the ones that the government has near total control over.If you enjoy films like The Magnificent Seven or The Dirty Dozen, and also happen to like comic book films, then I really think you'll enjoy this. People are far too quick to compare this to Marvel's misfit offering, Guardians of the Galaxy (which is an excellent film by the way, you should watch it!), when better comparisons are to the two films I just mentioned. Don't get sucked into the Marvel vs DC debate; it's OK to like both!(Review from my blog: whingewood.wordpress.com)",Suicide Squad
834,alombardy,It's wrong but in the wrong ways,5,22 August 2016,"I didn't expect to particularly like this film given the current status of the reviews coming out and the fact that I'm not in general a big DC or even comic book fan otherwise - but I have enjoyed super hero stuff perfectly well in the past. And... I didn't particularly enjoy it, but weirdly it was for things that I would have thought this film , whatever its flaws, would've been immune from. Foremost amongst these was the fact that, for a lot of the time, it was just plain dull.The hour in the middle is most to blame for this - essentially the 'squad' are making their way through city ruins toward the big bad boss and... that's literally it. They introduce these quite cool looking characters and build them up (I guess much like the pre-release hype via the trailers) and yet for this main part of the movie they just kind of walk next to a bunch of soldiers who slowly crawl their way through buildings, occasionally whacking a few bad guys themselves. It seems like a slow motion Call of Duty level and is criminal underuse of what otherwise seem like very promising characters.One aspect that has been praised is the casting, which on paper, does look good, but I just don't think Will Smith is suited to sharing the screen with an ensemble. Cara Delevingne's baddie is bizarrely funny but I kind of felt I was laughing at the pretty meh CGI superimposed over her than the character herself, and Margot Robie's cringe level is off the charts. I hear that, in fairness, the dialogue and action written for her is pretty loyal to the Harley Quinn source material, and that's great, but someone needs to tell the makers that film adaptations are exactly that - adaptations - and need editing and compromising; they can't just be a scene-for- scene copy and paste of the original.That said it's not the worst superhero film I've ever seen, and, if these characters are in future utilised properly there's definitely hope for the DC-verse, but this is sadly lacking in transferring much loved characters onto the big screen.

It doesn't suck the way a lot of people are crowing about, but it's not a masterpiece either the way a lot of other people are shouting.The good: I thought Margot Robbie's acting, without mentioning her accent, was pretty much spot on for what I would have expected from Harley Quinn. (I came close to naming my Harley Sportster ""Harley Quinn"" but then this movie started being advertised, so I named her ""Binky."") The plot made sense, even if it was a bit of a stretch here and there. Other people have complained about it, but I liked the music. I thought ""Spirit in the Sky"" was misplaced when it started, but whatever. Viola Davis plays a bad guy pretty well. I thought the actor who played Griggs (Ike Barinholtz) did a great job making us care about him and what happened. Jay Hernandez did a good jobs as Diablo. Most of the SFX didn't suck.The bad: Well, Margot Robbie's here and then gone again accent. (I could give her a slight break because I know how hard it is to carry an accent throughout a performance. But, OTOH, this wasn't a live show, she could have had an accent coach, and she got paid a lot more than I ever have, so no - no slight break.) For me the show screeched to a halt every time Leto's joker appeared on the screen. Man, I hated that characterization. It simply didn't work for me, even a little bit. Ditto Cara Delevingne - my Lord she is a terrible actress. And IMHO her body might look nice but her face certainly isn't all that. So, with the lack of a trace of acting ability coupled with not being gorgeous - she must be sleeping with someone to be getting these acting gigs. I simply couldn't buy her enchantress except when she was hidden under heavy makeup and CGI. Why the heck was Captain Boomerang in this story? He didn't add anything plot wise. At least Slipknot was there to show us the effectiveness of the ""persuasive device"" used to make the Suicide Squad go along.The ho hum: So yeah, once again Will Smith played Will Smith. If you like his ""Oh hell no!"" plus his ""now I'm going to speak slower in a lower register so you can tell I'm a serious and tortured soul"" then you will like his 1,000th (a made-up number to emphasize my point) rendering of this character.All in all, not a failed movie and not a master piece.",Suicide Squad

Jared Leto's Joker is a massive letdown and we also get one of the worst comic book movie villains of all time. Cara Delevingne cannot act to save her life, that much is obvious, but even Brie Larson would have struggled with Enchantress, who is lumbered with some truly dreadful dialogue and an unintentionally amusing CGI big brother.

I don't wanna accept this, but it was a big disappointment...The plot was not even close to successful. Such a huge mess. Pulling it a bit of here and there in order to make - again - an incomplete story. After Jack Nicholson's and Heath Ledger's Jokers, there is obviously a burden to take the role of this terrific villain. But Jared Leto did not even touched the hero's disturbed psychology and character in my opinion. It was all too contrived. The movie's poster was already to kitsch for me, but I thought that they just wanted to give it a little bit of ""comics"" aesthetic. The graphics in the very beginning of the movie, during the presentation of the Suicide Squad were such a bad-taste. Enchantress' appearance in the movie was something I was really looking forward to, 'cause she is a villain that not many people know about. Since she is named ""Enchantress"" of course there's gonna be a supernatural element to it, BUT, making her the main villain of the movie and everything turning around that element was a big failure to me.Although I feel that Margot Robbie's and Viola Davis's acting skills really saved the day - I never expected cold-blooded b***h Amanda Waller becoming one of my favorites - I found Margot Robbie's acting really ""too much"" at some points, but on the other hand, that's what Harley Quinn is, right?The connections to ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" as well as Ben Affleck's and Ezra Miller's cameos - as Batman and Flash respectively - were a pleasant surprise and were a plus for me.

Terrible dialogue, half arsed story, very, very bad directing, extremely lame plot. I can not even tell what happened during the action scenes. The Joker is a joke, I couldn't have cared less about any of these characters. No suspense, no interesting anything... huge missed opportunity for whoever made this garbage. I'm getting sick of these movies that don't put any effort into character development or suspense whatsoever. I don't know how people can enjoy the movies without at least any character development at all. Showing them isn't enough. The humor was eye-rolling and gutwrenching. I'm not a fan of the jokers look either, I don't even understand what they were trying to pull off with this story. Waste of a movie if you ask me...",Suicide Squad
845,EuricSanti,Was an overall waste - Poor DC,6,7 August 2016,"As a film fan and comic sort of reader, the movie is not such a big hit. Was more marketing than reality. I see more of the same, DC tried so hard to beat marvel that just became a copycat of avengers with dark humor. Even the trailer portrayed the first 20 minutes, more than anything, just as Avenger's Age of Ultron. Focused here. See what I just did? wasted my first paragraph on gibberish; like these will be your first 20 minutes. After that you will have a glimpse of the so much publicized joker, but non essential to the story line. Then you will half understand the film. So much shoots, so much action... some laughs on the way. After that, awesome especial effects, some of the Squad die... Done you will go home. The movie as a whole is not great, may have it's hype, but was like deadpool to Marvel, just funny talk, great effects and so much publicity people will stand up on the movie unhappy and not believing on trailers anymore. Enchanted as villain was not the best choice, the plot was like she was ULTRON. It has it's good moments like the awkward romance on the joker and Harley, also the story on DeadShot, they are really good ones and connect with people. I went with my wife and some friends, they just found it like this.It was sort of funny, i enjoy it, I laughed, but... I am not motivated to see it again; maybe if they make a sequel¨. Come on DC, you can make more than that.",Suicide Squad

I've seen it done before for though for example, Miss Congeniality. I thought that movie was going to be a stink bomb that would never wash off society or myself but I actually really loved that movie, I know I was shocked to! Anyways I had high hope's for Suicide Sqaud and I was sadly disappointed! My Hope that the Director would make a unique film that turned out awesome was sadly not the case, This movie sucked! The plot was everywhere, the comedy that was added to this supposedly dark film definitely didn't work for me and overall the movie definitely didn't come close to the expectations I had for it! Anyways my advice don't see this film. I truly believe you will be disappointed...",Suicide Squad
847,keving4241,As a fan of 1987 Suicide Squad comics I was pleased,8,5 August 2016,"First off, this can't be looked at in comparison to The Dark Knight because these are two very different stories in the Gotham Universe. People going into this with that mindset might be disappointed. I know this was more based off the 2011 Suicide Squad comics which I don't mind. I found it odd Deadshot got the spotlight as more of a ""main character"" type. It was something I could dislike easily because she's usually quiet and menacing in the background. Will Smith ended up playing a great Deadshot. As much as I love Harley, Joker steals the show. I love the classic cartoon Joker and he played it brilliantly.There's some good character development and the writing was more funny than I expected but DC is just so dark all the time I felt like it enhanced it. It's funny but in a dark twisted way in the comics. If I had to say some negatives... I don't like the shaky-cam action fight that are way too zoomed in to see anything. It was tolerable and there were some great action movie moments. However because they had character development, it allows the audience to care more about the fights/action. You can have a good character piece with bad action cause at least you care about what's going on. Bad writing or bad character presentation with great action will not get the crowd to have a reaction. But I wouldn't go as far as calling it bad. However the editing was terrible. I heard they took this movie into a focus group who knew nothing about movies or proper story structure for that matter and let them dictate what happened to it. David Ayer did a great job, don't ruin his work through editing. I'm reviewing this based off what I saw in his original idea. The movie would get a 9 if they didn't change it.I can't really judge it on a typical movie goer scale because I go to see the comic book movies for a reason. When they get it right, it's gold. I don't mind a few changes if they positively affect the overall outcome. This movie succeeded with that. I'd highly recommend to comic fans.",Suicide Squad
848,sarah-lou_12,"""I Mean, What The Hell Was That?""",1,2 December 2016,"Being Harley Quinn's biggest fan prior to the movie, I was looking forward to it immensely and was thoroughly disappointed. The characters we all know and love have been twisted to fit in with this new punk-pop style the director seems to be trying to foist on them, the soundtrack being further disconcerting proof of this. The messages of the film have been awfully skewed, particularly concerning the relationship between HQ and the Joker, which actually made me feel extremely uncomfortable, not least because ever since the films release girls have been trying to find a relationship in this vain. The relationship between them is supposed to be construed as damaging, not insanely romantic, and I think the messages this film has sent out to young girls regarding how they should act to be appealing to men and what sort of man they should be looking for are absolutely appalling. I wish I could say that despite this the film was good, but this is not the case. It was plot less, pointless, and utterly disappointing.",Suicide Squad

With really forced, sentimental sub-plots to make them seem more meaningful. All while doing obvious, stupid, overt violence. It is just sad, and I lost a lot of respect for Will Smith for doing this movie. All his characters - from the late Muhammad Ali to Agent J to Hancock were really good. Here it is all stupid violence from him, and literal evil. It made me sad to see this movie. Let's all hope there will never be a sequel. The world needs to be inspired right now (thank goodness for The Avengers and Superman and Sully the pilot and the new Spider-Man). Not given spectacles of heinous indecency and boring depravity.",Suicide Squad
850,hegedus_dani02,"A very disappointing, but still entertaining summer feature",6,22 August 2016,"When I first saw the 2015 Comic Con trailer of Suicide Squad, which included the Bee Gees song I Started a Joke, I thought that this is going to be an excellent blockbuster DC film. After I heard the reviews about it, my expectations fell down to a very low level. The fact, that David Ayer (Fury, Sabotage) is in the director's chair, and Zack Snyder's (Batman v Superman, 300, Watchmen) participation as an executive producer also worried me. I doesn't like his movies movies, especially not 300, which I think a highly overrated history film, compared to Ridley Scott's Gladiator and Wolfgang Petersen's Troy. I watched Suicide Squad in IMAX3D just a few hours ago. Let's start with the few good things. Overall, the movie is entertaining, and you not getting bored for even a minute. The visual effects and the soundtrack are amazing. Margot Robbie acts very well as Harley Quinn, except her fantasies, that are completely not matching with the plot. Viola Davies also pretty good as 'the Boss'. There are plenty huge mistakes in this film. The script is a hilarious mess. The characters are extremely underdeveloped, but what should we expected if all of them one by one would need a single movie? The direction and the visual style of this film are extremely awful. It can be clearly seen that David Ayer was a marine, just look for the precisely shot helicopter landing and departing. The actors are very bad, except the two of them which I mentioned above. Jared Leto is one of the most talented actors (watch Requiem for a Dream or Dallas Buyers Club), but his Joker is a disaster, if you saw the performances given by Heath Ledger in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008) and by Jack Nicholson in Tim Burton's Batman (1989). The other actors also didn't brought even the minimum for their unwritten characters, especially Will Smith. The DC's cinematic universe is heading down in a very wrong way, and it's sad that they can't see this in the studio. I really hope that 2017's Wonder Woman and Justice League Part 1 (featuring Zack Snyder as the director) will be much better than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. If you saw Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy or you had enough form the last three years DC movies you better avoid this picture. If you just want to a watch a summer action comic book movie, than you can give it a try, but don't expect a marvellous story telling or such an artistic director's vision than in The Dark Knight Trilogy. 6/10",Suicide Squad
851,sebbystone1,"Well, its more fun than anything else in the DCEU",4,16 August 2016,"I went into this with fairly low expectations, judging by the negative reviews from critics. I walked out feeling that, while not being that bad, and better than Man of Steel (3/10) or Batman vs Superman (2/10), Suicide Squad was flawed at several levels.Firstly, the writing is sub par. There is little development of character prior to the disaster begins that the squad has to stop. Which happens about ten minutes too early. The pacing is awkward and some of the dialogue is, for lack of a better word, cringe worthy (especially Harley Quinn), which was a shame as (despite never reading the books) I really wanted to like the characters.On that note, the characters are (mostly) disappointingly average, or simply annoying. In fact, the characters have been done better before this movie. Deadshot? Discount Deadpool. Diablo? Discount Dr Manhattan. To give credit where its due however, Diablo was the one character I actually liked, as his traits went beyond either ""loyal"" (Katana) or ""aggressive"" (Killer Croc). My least favorite is the Boomerang guy, who has practically nothing noteworthy to talk about. Also, half the time Harley was pretty cute and funny, and the other half of the time I was biting my fist in frustration. On the acting side of it, the actors mostly did a decent job, but sometimes Jared Leto was a bit too weird for me to watch easily.To be fair, this is the best DCEU movie so far (saying very little). I mean, its just a bit of dumb fun, at times. But with weird lighting (especially in action scenes) a couple of irritating characters and a weird plot thread I feel this could have been much better. For a good David Ayer movie, go see Fury (7/10).",Suicide Squad
852,wkallao,A Turn Around For The DCEU,10,7 August 2016,"I was pretty anxious about this film at first. Man of Steel and Batman V Superman weren't all that greatly received, and weren't that good in my personal opinion. I was worried for the future of the DC Extended Universe. I thought it could only get worse or stay the same, but I was wrong!DC has extremely strong villains, that's why this was the perfect story to show and tell. The premise is something innovative and new, not been done before in a theatrical release. Harley Quinn was incredible, and a highlight of this movie. Margot Robbie portrayed her so well, and couldn't have done better, aside from the costume. A solo movie will be amazing! Her relationship with the Joker was perfect.Deadshot was great as well, giving him motivation to care for his daughter, and just wanting what's best for her. Similarly with El Diablo and his deceased family. Many of the villains were shown in a lighter side, and gave them humanity instead of being seen as cold blooded monsters.The story was executed so well and so close to the original material. This is such a high note for the DCEU, despite what critics say. This is a turn around, and with Wonder Woman coming up next, this film series is headed straight for the gold.",Suicide Squad
853,Jazzy31133,Snatches Defeat from the Jaws of Victory,6,28 November 2016,"I think the IMDb user rating of 6.5 perfectly encapsulates what to expect. I use the site mainly to calibrate my expectations before watching a blockbuster or decide to invest my time in giving an indie feature a chance.Suicide Squad has such star power and superhero connections that I was going to watch it no matter what the user reviews said (I always disregard critic reviews as they rarely are helpful) and feel like many viewers were going to as well.The movie has cool set pieces, action scenes and fantastic costumes. However, the plot is so muddled and choppy it detracts from the viewing experience. Another weak link is the enemy - no real backstory to draw us in, almost no explanation on what the enemy is building, and almost laughable minions for the ""heroes"" to combat.There are so many cool characters, I think the movie and plot would have been better served if this had been Part I of a series, rather a stand alone movie.I read an article that stated David Ayer only had six weeks to put a script together and it unfortunately it shows. I felt like I was watching a long trailer - cool and fun scenes that were disconnected from each other.I certainly won't say to pass on this, especially comic book fans, but be warned it is a let down.

Despite this fact, I think you can understand the movie and the references; you're not loosing anything. I think this movie should be called ""DeadShot and Harley Quinn"", because when you think about it, these are the only characters from Suicide Squad that actually have some development and background stories; the remaining members don't seem to have such an interesting development, and there's one that dies right in the beginning of the ""gang"" being released.Furthermore, I must say I didn't enjoy the fact that Harley Quinn must be IN EVERY SCENE!! I mean, every time there's communication between some members of the Squad, Harley must talk... but why? It becomes annoying, and frankly there are some parts that could be cut (like the purse scene). Deadshot was an interesting character, but I must say it's very similar to other movies WIll Smith has made (like Hancock), so it looses originality. Despite these ""complains"", the movie is fun to watch.

856,alglasser-53401,Better than the critics let on.,8,12 August 2016,"When reviewing this film I wasn't real sure where to start, but I think I'll lead off with my conclusion. DC Comics fans are generally speaking, assholes. They must be. Because Suicide Squad has been bombarded with horrible reviews. I'm here to tell you that this is by far the best DC movie since The Dark Knight. It's funny to me that the fans destroyed Batman vs Superman because it was too dark, too slow, too long, too confusing, not enough fun...on and on and on (though Lex was awful). Those same people are destroying this movie for the exact opposite. Its just too jam packed with action and excitement for fans this time around. Suicide Squad is the DC equivalent of a Fast and Furious/Transformers film. The film manages to introduce about a dozen of DC's best villains along with cameos from Batman and the Flash. They managed to do that seamlessly without the film running 3 hours. No ""what's going on"" moments. No ""Who is that guy"" stuff. Was there a deeply themed plot? Not at all. Were the characters fleshed out and deeply humanized. Nope. However, they weren't ever intended to be. This is not a film like Man of Steel or Batman vs Superman where there were themes about men among gods and morality vs justice. This a DC fantasy film about ""What if the bad guys were the good guys"". They stayed true to the source material in the fact that this was never a deep story arc. It's smash em up fun. Casting was perfect. I say that even including the fact that I hate Will Smith. He almost didn't seem to be missing DJ Jazzy Jeff in this film. He was convincingly Deadshot. And Margot Robbie? Her ass in short shorts was enough reason to rate this movie 10 stars all on it's own! I know some of the critics didn't like the villain. Well news flash folks. All the best DC villains were the stars of this film! I also didn't think the enchantress was a bad pick for the villain. She was much more interesting than some of the villains in recent Marvel films and nobody's complaining about what's happening with those movies. The pace of this movie was quick. The visual effects were seamless and stunning. They loaded it with music like as if they were making the Madden sound track and the Easter egg after the credits was pretty good. I don't know what else to say other than don't listen to the haters. See this one and decide for yourself.",Suicide Squad

858,adrenachrome,A comic book movie review from a non-comic book guy,5,7 August 2016,"This review will possibly be long-winded and rambling. Sorry about that. I will also do my level best to NOT reveal anything about the plot in the way of spoilers, but I am not perfect, you have been warned. I am not a comic book reader. I have friends and co-workers who are so I know the general gist of the major comic heroes (Batman, Spiderman, etc.) but with SS, I really had no idea outside of the Joker.The challenge here with that, is most comic book movies are written for fans that have at least a passing knowledge of the character, and not for people like me who really don't. In that respect, SS failed to make me care about the characters because they spent too little time telling you not only *who* they are, but *why* they are. The *why* is as important as anything else, because if you don't care what happens to the characters, it becomes difficult to care about the film in general.This happened (to me anyway) with Age of Ultron, too many characters introduced with little development to them. I honestly thought Vision, when introduced, was Martian Manhunter, because that was the only hero I knew of that had red skin. I'd never heard of Vision and was totally confused as to why a DC character was in the Marvel movie.In any case, we have a number of ""bad guys"" whose motivations are highly unclear, whose background is murky, and when whatever happens to them occurs, I don't care.Sin number 1. You must develop your characters, unless you are aiming for fans only.Sin number 2. Keep an even keel. This film fluctuates between dark, and comedic. It's difficult to buy into a character's motivation(s) when you can't grasp their purpose. With Ms. Quinn, I got it, she's a loon, so she'll switch between the two extremes with ease, and it works (mostly) but for say, Killer Croc, it doesn't, because comedic doesn't seem to fit with what little the movie gives us about him.I understand these comedic elements were added after the fact, so they might not all be the director's fault, but it doesn't help the film.In any event, this film is bound to be (if not already) controversial. We know the critics hated it, the die hard fans loved it, but for the folks on the fence like me? Well I remain on the fence. The movie had great potential, and the actors did their level best with that they had to work with, but sadly that wasn't much and the film suffers greatly because of that.Two notable points: This is mainly a Wil Smith movie. If you don't like him, you've been warned, he's the lead character.The Joker is rarely seen, and is mostly a force of nature rather than a character in the movie, which adds a positive point to the film.So, final words? The film strove to be so much more, and yet failed to reach that goal. A tragedy. Maybe next time gang, maybe next time.",Suicide Squad

This character is totally unnecessary, like Katana, Killer Croc etc.If some DC-fanboy will complain about Marvel-villains (yes, they are mostly weak), Enchantress lowed all of them, including Malekith and the Mandarin.This was the last movie I watched from this intentionally cash-cow.DCCU, you've been dead on arrival, now I'm sure.",Suicide Squad

It was awesome getting to know the key players that we'd be falling in love with if it's possible to fall in love with bad guys which since I did it is! I especially love Harley she was a source of humor throughout the movie but don't let her out of your sight just yet she's in trouble ten times over but she handles herself with ladylike grace and some punk Kick butt in the middle. I liked Will Smith's interpretation of Deadshot, you knew why he was taking part in this suicide mission and he really turned out to be the leader we expected him to be. As for Jared Leto's Joker, I don't know why he was complaining or saying that he was fooled into making this movie. He was the complete package makeup and all lipstick fetish notwithstanding. While he had a small part in the film there are no small parts, his ""death"" was what gave Harley her turn into a good guy, not that she wasn't always., She seemed to play as the heart of the suicide squad. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje did a hell of a job as killer croc I loved the Cajun accent he had going on and really did the character a lot of justice.

The story of this movie was probably written by the retarded monkey and handed to David Ayer who was drunk and high at the same time when he got it. Now, what can I say about Cara Delevingne. You really have to be a stupid mother***ker to give her a role in this kind of movie. I don't even understand why did I watch it after I read that she and bunch of some other ""actors"" get to act in it. And finally, the best for last - Jared Leto aka ""Joker"" aka Get the *uck out!

871,chloe-webb-01,A little short of what it could be,6,4 August 2016,"Firstly, I found it started off quite fast, introducing all the characters as briefly as possible, was a task. There was some substance missing in the scenes of the Joker, to begin with. I feel as though there could have been much more dramatic shots of him, it was almost comedic like. However, in the later half of the film I seen Jared Leto shine through with glimpses of his fantastic acting skills. If there is to be a sequel, which is obvious- then I believe they will allow more screen time for the diabolic couple, Harley and Joker. The first thing that struck me was the soundtrack! Instead of instrumental or theme songs, they chose well known classics from different genres to spark interest for the viewer, as first seeing each character, the songs coincided with them. Secondly, you can rest assured that the costume department was not lacking in this film! Every piece was striking and significant of each character. I can almost predict that cosplay lovers are going crazy for the next comic conventions, to show off their replicas from this film. Lots of great props and whimsical items throughout. The overall inclusions of the film are good for any movie lover, as it catered to the bad ass, the sexy, the sad, funny, action, serious and quality actors that make a great essential. The part that fell short, in my opinion, was the plot and the scenes that we have oh so many times seen. Which are 'let's save the city' and the gun action fights in between buildings. There wasn't enough to capture you through those moments, in the cgi department. I did like the variety of all the characters, but at the same time it was hard to enjoy it more, knowing that it was far fetched. I would have liked an in depth on each character and why they had special powers or what have you. My favourite would have to be Diablo, he is super cool for anyone that likes an underdog or not so much of a showy costume character. I have to agree that Margo Robbie was superb in her acting, and the delivery of all her lines were on the mark. The Joker was not in it enough and didn't have solid script to mesmerize, hopefully we see more of him to come. So I would like to say, go see this and enjoy it, but don't expect to be amazed. It's just some bad ass fun.",Suicide Squad
872,seth-goodwin23,Pure Fun,8,7 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is full of both positives and negatives. It has good humor, lots of fun, and awesome characters. Unfortunately, the movie lacks a good story and feels as if some scenes were cut short because the fear of a long run time. In this case, a long run time would not be so bad because it would flesh out the story better. The casting was great for this movie. Margot Robbie killed it as Harley Quinn, Will Smith did a good job as Deadshot, and Jared Leto gave us a new and unique version of The Joker. The other characters were alright but those three were the ones that stood out the most. The biggest problems in this movie lie within the story and the editing. The movie would've been better had some of the scenes been longer and gave the audience more context. Despite the story and the editing, it doesn't stop the movie from being fun. The movie has lots of action and good humor and it made up for the poor story/editing. This movie was a total blast and really enjoyable. If you like a movie with a good story, this isn't for you. If you like a fun movie with lots of action, this is just that movie. It had exactly what Batman v Superman was lacking: fun. While Batman v Superman has a more in-depth and complex story, Suicide Squad has a weak story, but loads of fun to make up for it. If you like superhero movies, I recommend seeing this one. Another plus about seeing this movie is it helps set up Justice League which hits theaters November 2017.",Suicide Squad
873,mduquenoy-1,So much to say about this film but not at all worth the effort,1,10 May 2019,"This is an appalling film.
Jared Leto is awful. Truly the worst 2-dimensional performance. And all the more painful to watch when he's doing ""Oooh I'm crrraaaazzzyyyyyy"" Nothing short of embarrassing. Please, never put him in those metal teeth again.
The Aussie delivers every single line in a mumble. He's lost and his part is completely forgettable. Oh and his weapon of choice is a metal boomerang (?!??)
No idea what Harley Quinn is doing. She's just a bit mental which surely isn't good enough to be a part of a 'superhero' hit squad.
Will Smith is brilliant - he goes along literally as Will Smith being dumbfounded by what's going on around him.Really uninteresting characters and you don't care what happens to them.",Suicide Squad

875,mrwnmero,"First of all, let's stop comparing any DC project to Nolan's trilogy",2,1 December 2016,"Nolan set a very high bar that no superhero movie can reach, so, without comparing any DC project to TDK, let's just see what a movie has to offer on its own. based on that I can genuinely say that suicide squad is one of the worst waste of times I have ever had !! I will not talk about Leto's Joker (although I seriously wanted to stop watching after he put his laughing mouth tattoo on his face and started laughing), when it comes to all the characters in general I saw a great possibility of making a movie about ""crazy"" people who were forced to help, while all their thinking was focused on how to escape they started to feel responsible for saving the world, or themselves at least, and end up doing good! instead all I saw was a bunch of funny crazy wannabes who are surprisingly very good at fighting any sort of creatures, with some flashbacks from time to time to tell each character history, which was supposed to make me feel a little.... I don't know, sympathy?about 20 minutes into the extended version I realized that I am watching some nonsense, that I must finish to give a fair rating. after finishing I realized that I would have felt better today if I spent those 2+ hours doing anything else.Every second I watched today told me one thing; DC should stop making movies, no don't try to make them better, just stop. you were legendary once and you have the greatest comic book characters ever created, don't ruin your legacy, please.",Suicide Squad
876,storysplicer,Not as bad as I thought it would be,5,12 August 2016,"The draw for me to see this movie was Margot Robbie. I really enjoyed her performance in ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" In addition to her obvious physical attributes, she was funny, smart and engaging in that film. In ""Suicide Squad,"" her posterior gets about the same amount of screen time as her face. Not that this is a bad thing from an aesthetic point of view, but her Harley Quinn was not nearly as dominant a presence as I was led to believe from the trailer and the press coverage. So I felt shortchanged. Other than that, Will Smith and Jay Hernandez really made the film for me. They overcame their typecasting to bring depth and humanity to their characters. I liked the film's take on trying to make ""bad"" people sympathetic by showing how they got that way. Otherwise, this movie was just plain weird. Its gritty realism was totally at odds with the more fantastical elements; it seemed to have a split personality.",Suicide Squad
877,CyclopsKnowsBest24,"When compared to the trailers, it's disappointing. When compared to other superhero films, it's average.",3,15 August 2016,"Let me start by saying that ""Suicide Squad"" (2016) was my most hyped up film of the year, mainly due to my love for the characters, actors, and brilliant marketing. From the first dark and moody trailer to the fun and action packed Bohemian Rhapsody trailer, I knew this film had a lot going for it. To say my expectations were high would be an understatement, and sadly I feared they wouldn't be meet.After seeing the film twice, I have come to terms with how I really feel about it. The best way I can sum up how I felt about this film is by making a list. This is a good, the bad, and the ugly of ""Suicide Squad.""The Good: ""Suicide Squad's"" best thing it has going for it both in the trailers and the film is the cast (aside from the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). Margot Robbie completely steals the show as Harley Quinn, and it is so refreshing to see an actress bring to life such an iconic role and do it justice.Viola Davis was the standout in this film as Amanda Waller. Every time she is on the screen she brings a powerful and commanding presence, you can actually see why the Squad takes her seriously.Will Smith's Deadshot of course gets a lot of screen-time, though his performance doesn't feel out of his usual range.Every other character is good to fair, but unfortunately we do not get enough time to really get to know them.The Bad: Sadly, the Joker (Jared Leto) gets very little screen-time in ""Suicide Squad,"" even though he was probably the second most anticipated character next to Margo's Harley Quinn. It is obvious to see that a lot of Leto's scenes were cut out of the film, especially ones that depicted his abusive relationship with Harley. If you were looking forward to finally see a great depiction of the iconic ""Mad Love"" comic book story, you will sadly be disappointed.It seems that ""BVS"" being seen as too dark and moody, may have heavily influenced David Ayer and company to get rid of those intense/dark scenes. Sadly, we will never know if that was a good choice to remove them or not.The Ugly: The areas where ""Suicide Squad"" clearly fails are editing and writing. Sadly, the film is an editing mess. You can tell that Ayer didn't have clear direction for the story he wanted to tell, and if he did, someone else must of have strongly suggested to change his original idea.The film tries to combine several different tones, but sadly it can't quite identify what kind of film it wants to be.The writing is sadly also weak and very typical to many other action films. It has a generic villain (which is kinda hilarious in a film all about them) played by a very weak actress, Cara Delevingne. Her powers mainly involved her ""dancing"" and when she was possessed by the witch her voice was dubbed over, so if Cara could actually deliver a threatening line we will never know.The humor is also hit or miss. Some lines are funny, while others are just generic. For a film with both Harley Quinn and the Joker you would have expected some better material.In the end, ""Suicide Squad"" isn't the worst superhero film ever, but it doesn't meet it's hugely possible potential. The film had a ton of material to work with from the outstanding ""Mad Love"" story to a great core cast and characters. Sadly, it did not take full advantage of these things with the writing, directing, and editing. I truly hope WB/DC gets their act together with ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) and ""Justice League"" (2017),especially in the writing/editing department.",Suicide Squad
878,xkristitx,Disappointed,5,7 August 2016,"I was so pumped up by the trailers & ready to see this movie & after this movie was finished all I thought was ""what the heck did I just watch?"" This movie had so much potential to be great & it ended up being a horrible mess. I am very disappointed that the trailers made it seem like the joker had a huge role in the movie but he was maybe in the movie an entire 20 mins. So let down that they didn't utilize his character. It could've helped the entire movie. The movie has a few witty one liners & wasn't too terrible but the witch taking over & talking in tongue made me feel like i was watching a low budget remake of the mummy or waiting in line for the mummy ride at universal, I couldn't get over the ending scenes. (Eye roll) I could go on & on about how let down I am but over all, I was not satisfied. I was let down & expected more, it had so much potential to be good too. But once again it just proves that DC is not on the same level as marvel movies & it's a shame. PS Harley Quinn was terribly annoying as well. Ugh.",Suicide Squad
879,Se7en14,Great Start Flat Finish,7,6 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was probably one of my most anticipated titles of 2016 for the summer ever since the announcement and my love for both Marvel and DC and especially after the amazing animated title Assault on Arkham which if you haven;t seen you definitely should a great animated title with the suicide squad and batman and joker all together. It's hard to say what exactly the issue was here but mostly it feels like the start of the movie it's going to be fun but falls flat afterwards. Much like Guardians of the Galaxy which was a surprising hit for me and others this movie seems to lose it's fun afterwards.First off lets talk characters. Will Smith was obviously the star as was Margot Robbie who stole the show as Harley Quinn and nailed the character perfectly, Will Smith played..... Will Smith he didn't encompass the Deadshot I know and love from the comics which I can accept but he just didn't play anything other Captain Hillard, Agent J with a new set of weapons and skills,IE it's nothing new to the role and he doesn't bring much here. Viola Davis does a bang up job as Amanda Waller she's psychotic horrible person, who's either your best friend or worst enemy, not good not bad but she'll do anything to get what she wants. The rest of the cast does a great job also and their chemistry is bang on and then there's Jared Leto's Joker..... I remember when people bashed Heath Ledger for the role of it and ended up being amazing in TDK, Jared Leto when he got the part I have to admit was excited to see how he'd bring life to the role, and even after the backlash of how his character looked, I still wanted to give him a chance, as I would with any character. Sadly The Joker is not only underused but the character is just off and seems to be there as a selling point for people to go see the movie as The Joker is one of the most popular villains of all time, yet here he's given not much time, and not much to do with the role. The rest of the squad are OK El Diablo is fun and Captain Boomerang is a very guy, all in all their chemistry together is fantastic, the quips, jokes and fun they have, shines on the screen. The Story is easy, a bunch of criminals are set up after the death of superman to be controlled by government to do missions no one else will do and if they die, so be it they're criminals anyways, and if they survive they get benefits and time knocked off their sentence. Of course one of the squad decides to disobey and cause a ruckus ( Enchantress) and then decides to let her brother out and start building a weapon and destroy everyone so it's up to the suicide squad to take her down and save humanity. Sad part the villain is very boring... both of them are, and this would've been good to have maybe used the joker as a means to be the villain much like Assault on Arkham, but we get a very bland villain with silly motivations and while the first half of the film has a unique style and flare, the second part drags and stops using that fun throughout. Guardians seemed to use the formula correctly whereas SS seems to have tried to make it fun dark and fun. It could've been good but in the end much of the film suffers from just pacing issues, being bland and story dragging out. It's not to say the movie is bad the cast works great the characters are fun but the movie as a whole just felt in one word very meh... Not bad not memorable not great just OK. Decide on yourself if the movie is good or not you may hate or love it, but in all just felt there could've been more done, here's hoping much like the BVS extended cut the Suicide Squad is given extended look when it comes to home video.",Suicide Squad
880,acidrosesrijit,Flop Squad,2,22 August 2016,"Let it be known that I am more a DC comics fan and have loved the Suicide Squad comics that were so excellently written by John Ostrander. Characters like Peacemaker, Bronze Tiger, Nightshade, Black Thorn were missed. Evil characters like Kobra and/or The Crimson Jihad could have easily provided an impetus for an excellent story line.An incomplete incoherent chaotic mess of a movie, the story line suppurated like Lovecraftian flotsam and jetsam slime without a beginning, middle, or end. The loud flashes of photosensitive epilepsy (reminiscent of Cyber Soldier Porygon) failed to charm the dullest of viewers. There was no great reason to assemble hardened criminals together except for Waller's ""...making people work against their wishes"" rant. I get the Dirty Dozen slant to the whole Suicide Squad thing – but where is the story, people??? In a setting such as this, where you get a bunch of villains and anti-heroes into a swirl, you need to have a catch with all of them. First off, Deadshot's inaccurate portrayal of a supportive daughter can, however, still be passed off as a reason to let Lawton serve in the Squad and pine for freedom. Why Croc? Why Harley? Why Boomerbutt? Why Diablo? This is a team that is not meant for keeps – this is a team that arises as the effect of a cause.In the 2nd World War, there were teams of criminals both from the Allied and Axis who were thrust to the forefront and forgotten. They were men who were sadistic and callous and without a hope in hell. But then, they were the effect of a cause. During the ravaged days of the war, with dwindling soldiers and dipping morale, the two sides needed every able finger on the trigger.The mistake, with Suicide Squad is that, there is no reason to assemble Task Force X, except to stop Superman. The reason – aka, the cause, was lame and not convincing enough in the context of the 120 minute film. A team of heroes is assembled only when there is a cause, and a team of super villains is assembled only when there is no hope left. Enchantress/Incubus could have been that cause, although I was half expecting them to pull out the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from their kitty. Who you gonna call? Not Task Force X. Can I get my money back please?",Suicide Squad

882,itsachfigueroa68,No a disaster but neither a film worth remember,6,13 August 2016,"OK let explain what we are missing from this film, Common sense and fast phases. I understand that they want the movie to have action and more action but it was missing the element of introduce the squad. They did very well with Will smith and Margot , but the rest of them team I can't barely even remember them. But what about the Joker, I was so excited to see the Joker fell in love with Harley that I was well I have a new ship,no happening. I was so disappointed that I couldn't enjoy the turbulent love physiology between this two character. I m definitely down to watch a Harley Quinn solo movie, she make me believe that she was the right cast for that character in specific. The films was not only fast phase , it did no make sense in some points. One minute you were watching this and in the other they jump to another locations. Amanda Waller another disappointment, I was like yeah this woman is going to fight and make the enchanted life miserable, No Happening neither.I don't really see the reason of the Flash and Batman to be in this movie even though both of the appearance where short I was like OK. Once again the Joker Jared is no bad but we have a expectation from the Joker that it would never be satisfy. After heath ledger , we have picture the Joker with his face and personality , unfortunately he is no any longer with us to portrait this character so, and I am not a fan of Jared Leto but please stop comparing leto work with Ledger. They would nerve ever been another joker like the one that Christopher Nola delivery us in Batman dark knight. With that been said I give a 6 to this move for the actors portrait , they were good but scrip was trash.

Nothing about it captured my interest.Then tonight (August 2020), a good friend said that he watched it recently and that I should check it. ""Great film,"" he said. I will not trust his film recommendations again.From start to finish, there was not a single redeeming element to this film. Not a shred of anything even remotely interesing. Not the premise. Certainly not the characters. And the script was a tattered collage of disconnected boringness.The first part of the film (initial 30 minutes or so) introduces us to the bad guys (well, to most of them) and gives us a little peek into their past: how they got caught or how they went bad or how they blah blah who cares?This beginning was just too long-winded and uninteresting. I wanted to turn it off, but I persevered.After that, the film just becomes your run-of-the-mill film about getting from Point A to Point B with a few obstacles thrown in the way. Who cares? I gave it two stars instead of just one because you get to see Will Smith's amazing sweaty chest in the beginning. Rawr.",Suicide Squad
884,blueclementinex,It's not as good as your expect nor as bad as you heard,2,3 August 2016,"To start it off, i'm a big fan of dc cinematic universe, and the year 2016, hadn't been a good year for me and the other fans. Even though, i'll state myself optimistic, since actually, all my hopes and expectation fall into this movie instead. OK, Let's start with the strong aspects of the movie; performances and characters. well, i actually think this is what the director want to top off and show to the audience, thus forgetting the plot, which we will get into later. but the characters and the performances are well-performed- Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn really tops off my expectation. i'm a fan of harley quinn character, and she actually brought me the harley quinn i'm expected for- sexy, beautiful, it girl of joker's. while watching the movie, and whenever i'm feeling bored, harley quinn is there to make the scene fresh. and i think all audience, including audiences who didn't know her will love her and feel sympathetic to her. Will smith as deadshot actually didn't deserve much of my appreciation. i mean even though he's one of the great and strong aspect in the movie, i just thought i don't see will smith even trying to act, which weirdly works. watching Will smith here is just watching him using a kickass suit. Jared Leto as The Joker, is actually isn't the worst part of the movie (unlike what people might have said) i think that Jared Leto pull of a great effort into his character, and some scene of him showing up gave me goosebumps and own joys. but, maybe how little the scene for him is, or his character is pretty under-developed that just doesn't fit the puzzle in the movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller also brought up my her characther pretty well, as she played the cold-hearted leader Amanda Waller. other performances are great, like Joel Kinnaman, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Karen Fukuhara, and Cara Delevigne.The chemistry between the characters are great, as well as the development between their relationship. in my opinion, one of the strongest chemistry is Harley Quinn and Deadshot. Their chemistry is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together. even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is Rick Flagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, and unnecessary. Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plot is the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under-developed,and at some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it too much, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch the movie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI is pretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between the scenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think they could do better after building up the story of the fight scene.At the end, everything has its bad and has its good, what i really suggest for you to do is just lower your expectation, yet don't miss it either. it may not lift the hype as in the greatness in the trailer, but i think it's still a great fun must see summer movie , and you should enjoy it without all the overly negative critics.GUYS IM KIDDING THIS IS THE WORST FILM EVER DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME MONEY ON IT.",Suicide Squad
885,marcferrantejr,Entertaining at times but overall pretty bad movie,1,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad starts out OK then crashes and burns. I really wanted to like this movie but it was just impossible. There was no character development at all, the CGI was freakin terrible, the editing sucked, the main villain had potential to be awesome but they didn't use her at all, and it was super predictable. I did like some of the characters. Margot Robbie was good as Harley Quinn, Will Smith was such a likable character as Deadshot, Jai Courtney did the impossible and was good in a movie, and Jared Leto was easily the best part of this movie. He killed it as joker but there is one complaint I have with his character, he's in it for like twenty minutes. Every time he was about to do something that you wanted to see the scene just ends. Joel Kinnaman was fine but his character had really corny lines at times, El Diablo was alright, I didn't really like Killer Croc,I really wanted to like Enchantress but the way they used her was pretty boring and the movie just felt incomplete. Batman is in it for a little bit in the very beginning and it made me think to myself during the final battle ""where the hell is batman during all of this?"" The movie doesn't take place in gotham but we saw he has a jet in B v S. There were so many plot holes and the ending of the movie is so rushed and half assed.

Just that?! Nothing else in the middle?? That totally confused me. They should've added a few scenes in between. The soundtrack? It was good. Acting? Over the top. In spotlight was Harley Quinn and Joker. Though there were only a few scenes of him.The plot was average but suffered much. This film had much humour than BvS and sometimes that wasn't needed but eh...... It worked mostly. All of the characters did something but what did Cap Boomerang did? Just the fun part though. The flash cameo was fun to watch and Batman too. The villain didn't felt much like a threat y'know... After watching the film I want an extended R rated version of it because many things felt missing in the film. I would recommend it to you. But don't have your expectations high. It's a fun Popcorn flick I'll give you that.My rating 6.5/10.,Suicide Squad

First off, Margot Robbie and Will Smith were the PERFECT choice for their respective roles. Secondly, the story and plot are better then reviews would suggest. Now I do believe that Tom Hardy would have made a better Rick Flag, but you can't have the cake and eat it too. Viola Davis is also perfectly cast as well, then that brings me to that Joker. I was truly disappointed in the joker....having limited screen time. From what was shown, it was different and edgy, don't compare to previous jokers, you'll be disappointed.

894,teodoreh,"Trailers promised too much, that movie couldn't deliver",6,30 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is not a bad superhero movie. But it's not the best. I think the first trailer promised too many things but the movie delivered too few. Sometimes you think it's the DC curse - those people seem to be unable to make a good movie while on the other side, Marvel makes blockbuster hits even from unknown to the general public super heroes like DeadPool.So let's start with the movie: One of the best parts of superhero movies is the initial introduction. See how beautifully every superhero was introduced on Avengers. on SSq. the introduction is weak and somehow tries to be psychedelic and funny but it's not. It's just, too badly edited.Then the ""dark"" part every superhero movie has nowadays: The ethical dilemmas are somehow lost between serious dialogues and comic relief lines. In the end, it seems to be more of a movie for small kids.As for acting, surely Harley Quinn is the star here, and with her partner they seem to give some color to the story-line, but again, that's just not enough. For example Willy Smith is a veteran, but he's forced to make the STUPITEST come back (""I will help you accomplish your mission because I was touched by.. something"") and that's not bad acting, it's just bad script.I think the problem is on all aspects of the film (editing, script and directing) and it's a common DC movie problem, the fact that they are REALLY in a hurry to unify their universe like Marvel does, but it is SO irritating the way they do it.Even on Avengers 2, there were script problems and stupid ethical dilemmas that intended to make the movie a bit darker. S.Sq, tries to make everything dark in a ridiculous way. It's a mixed messages situation, and in the end you can't take any part of it seriously. Btw, same problem was present on ""Batman vs Superman"". I am not sure why writers want nowadays to paint heroes so dark while they are not. Spoiler: The SuicideSquad talks on the bar about killing people. Harley Quinn is so sensitive about the death of the family of her fellow soldier, but in the end, a dozen of prison guards die so as she can escape (and a whole bunch of others die on Joker's first attempt). Yes she's psychedelic, but people miss the point here - if a point was intended to exist.The biggest worries is that the next DC movies (with the Aquaman being introduced twice so far) will continue this bad bad tactic. DC movies get worse and worse.",Suicide Squad
895,chuckpw,Epic waste of time.....,2,17 December 2016,"I finally caught this flick on a cross-country plane trip from Vancouver to Toronto; this was the offering on the in-flight entertainment system. I wasn't sure what to expect as I had heard a lot of hype leading up to the release but I never jumped on the band wagon at the time to check it out. I've never read the comic that relates to these character, maybe I should have because I had no idea what the heck the plot was about. It was all over the map and quite honestly I had a feeling of deja vous throughout this movie as I got the feeling I'd seen much of this already in Ghostbusters, Hancock, Batman etc. This movie was an epic waste of time. It was apparent that they had spliced certain parts of the movie together since there were so many continuity issues throughout the movie.

898,AtariBaby,"Better than the previous DC movies, but still short of good",6,7 August 2016,"I was expecting awesomeness for about 10 minutes of this movie. It starts with an exciting bang, but it starts to get muddled, reportedly due to many re-shoots and edits. Then you start to realize you're mostly going to get pretty CGI.The film has no heart. There's a scene where one of the members refers to the Suicide Squad as ""family"", but that's the moment when I said to myself, we were never shown what makes these people feel like family. It's as empty as that Batman V Superman moment when Superman and Batman are suddenly friends because they realize their moms share the same first name.Marvel had another breakaway cult hit called ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", and DC rushed to have one just like it, and they fell short of a James Gunn thrill ride with living, beating heart.It's not bad, but it doesn't rise to ""good"".On the technical side, I see no reason to pay for 3D or IMAX. The 3D post processing is minimal and not convincing, and there are no must-see moments in IMAX.",Suicide Squad
899,Robotvideo,I was expecting more,2,7 August 2016,"I was very excited to see this movie. I'm not familiar with the characters from the comic books, but a gang of super villains turned super heroes seemed like a lot of fun. What I discovered was that the super villains weren't so super, the graphic design was bland and the action generic. All of which did not lead to an engaging movie. The short of the story: Post Batman vs. Superman, Batman puts a few bad guys in super villain prison, an even badder guy shows up, a proactive political type takes the initiative to let the bad guys out to get the badder guy and save the world. Sounds cool, right? The problem is that, for the most part, the characters and action were flat with no payoff. Back in the good ol' Arnold/Sylvester 80's action movies you got a story setup where the only way out was through, action that was ridiculously over the top but creative, comic relief (with quotable cheesy one liners) and a satisfying ending of poetic justice. Suicide Squad did not follow this formula and would have been better if it had. Where did it go wrong? First, the characters. The only character with a real attempt to add dimension to was Deadshot. The only real problem with Deadshot was that Will Smith played the character and Will Smith has a tendency to be Will Smith in every movie. There was some backstory on Harley Quinn and Diablo, but nothing that added any real value to the story. All of the other supers were basically red shirts.One of the biggest letdowns for me was Harley Quinn. Before seeing this movie I read so much about how she was the highlight of the show, but the character really missed being a lasting classic character on so many levels. I was expecting a complex mix of manipulative powers similar to Black Widow, but more flirty with a big dose of Hannibal Lecter. What we got was an attempt to convince everyone she was crazy by saying off the wall things and laughing all the time. The same is also true for the Joker, who goes hand in hand with Harley. What made classic insane characters work like Hannibal and Heath Ledger's Joker work so well was that they were based in real characteristics of mental illness and the criminally insane, not the superficial ""voices are telling me to kill everyone"" that we get here. Criminal insanity is the inability to tell right from wrong, or as I see it, complete loss of any type of empathy for others or a conscience. It is often accompanied by a view that the whole world is doomed anyway, so why would you work to better it or care what happens to it, which would be an easy perspective to pull off with any of these characters.My biggest issue with this movie is that the super heroes were not very super. It seemed that they needed saving more than Generic Soldier #X. Even in the universally panned BvS each character had complimentary abilities needed to solve a problem. Except for Deadshot no one's abilities were used very much at all.The real mystery of the movie was why the director approved faceless potato men as the graphic design of the villain army soldiers. Not scary.The Good? I gave this 2 stars solely for Viola Davis. She shows how a good actor can turn a sow's ear of a script into a silk purse. She knocked the character of Amanda Waller out of the park so hard that she seemed out of place here. This character was the only redeeming aspect of the movie. Amanda was the politician trying to save the world, but in the process was more evil than any of the super villains. It was a dose of reality that may be lost in the shadow of a bad movie overall, but was brilliant in concept. A subtle yet chilling badness that should have been applied to Harley Quinn as effectively. Both characters could have been equally strong and vicious, but yin-yang opposites. That could have been interesting to explore.The verdict? Pass on this one. If you want good over saturated superhero movies re-watch The Dark Knight and the original Avengers again, or maybe one of the X-Men movies.",Suicide Squad

The best parts for me were the joker and harley scenes. The villain was a problem. To be honest, that is another problem that the DCEU needs to work out.One positive thing that I will say about this movie is that the characters are great. They mesh together really well and have depth. I really liked the Batman cameo. The main negatives of this film are the editing, villain, and CGI. If all three of these items had been changed, this movie would probably be great instead of ""okay.""I guess we can say that the movie set out what it intended to do and that is to entertain, so for that, I am pleased.",Suicide Squad

I left the movie still not knowing a lot about most of the characters - The only ones that really got any development was Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The rest might as well have been in the background. The Plot was all over the place and the minions were literally faceless and you could barely see them they were so dark in a dark movie. Not sure what the Joker was even doing in the movie. And the guy who played him was awful. Did enjoy The characters of Deadshot and Harley Quinn and, unlike other reviews, I liked the humor in the movie. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the worst either.

I feel that we can't really judge the acting since the actors are really limited and forced to make psychopaths, killers and cold blooded assassin fit the PG-13 rating, this also limits your scrip. They could've save the joker for a standalone movie and use that movie time to give more depth to characters like Diablo, who's dead would've been more meaningful.

904,Iron-Bat-Prime,"Suicide Squad: ""Im Beautiful!""",5,9 August 2016,"Rating: 7.7, Good Movie, SCREW YOU Peter Travers (2.5), But He Gives Batman: Forever (7.5)....* I've said it before, with Batman V Superman, Dawn Of Justice (6.7), MARVEL's superheroes are way better,(except Batman of course) but when it comes to the villains of the DC Universe, MARVEL drops the ball. When I found out that David Ayer director of Fury (9.5) was making a Suicide Squad movie, I was flipping, and the trailer caught all our eyes. Suicide Squad is a new twist in the super hero genre that even the harshest of MAVEL fans will love, but not the critics... like Peter Travers...* Characters: - Deadshot: Floyd Lawton, A.K.A Deadshot is played by 'good guy' Will Smith, a lot of people have issues with him. Peter Travers says he supposed to be a ""heartless assassin""- true, but he also has a big mouth and a daughter? Besides his solo hell fire scene was as good as Batman's warehouse fight. Get your facts right Peter!Harley Quinn: Margot Robbie plays an awesome Haley Quinn, she has the look, the humour and the bat, to put the smile or bruise on everyone's face, except Peter Travers...Rick Flagg: Flagg is you typical Michael Bay character, badass American patriot who bleeds blue, red and white, and I loved it.Captain Boomerang: You can hate Jai Courtney all you want, sure Boomerang is useless in a fight, but he is hilarious, dat beer slurp was gold!Killer Croc: I didn't like how he looked, but when he's in action, the Croc can shock!El' Diablo: I'd never heard of him before, he has an interesting character with a blazing origin story, no doubt the strongest and loving in the squad he trusts!Katana: An anime inspired character who's swords devour the souls of her victims, Awesome!Slipknot: HAHAHAHAHAHAH, oh god I saw it coming.. BOOM! HAHAHAHA!Amanda Waller: It's true Viola Davis's Waller is great, why? Because she keeps you guessing to figure her as the good lady or the bad girl all with the menacing look.Enchantress: OK no more jokes, Enchantress, and her brother and her zombies suck, pointless boring antagonists to assign the squad on their first mission.Joker: And Here We Go. Nicholson gave us the Funny, Ledger (R.I.P.) gave us the Dark and Leto gives us, just the Creepy. On screen Jarryd Leto played an awkward joker who at some times was creepy and other times was cool, still I would have preferred him to be the main antagonist. Troy Baker and the legendary Mark Hamill are still the greatest Jokers!* Plot & Design: It's a real shame when your characters are just awesome but the plot really falls. Ayer tries to draw from the cataclysm of BVS, but the movies Antagonist make it pointless. The movie's pace through introduction is executed well but through the feature its evolves into just a CGI mess. Still Deadshot, Rick and Harley deliver some great action sequences rivalled by the movie's delicious music score.* I like to see it as DC's take on Guardians Of The Galaxy (9.3), its very funny and very entertaining, so I recommend watching it whether your a MARVEL or DC fan. It's great twist on your average superhero blockbuster, now a message to Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone and his fellow abusive Critics. I follow you because I hate you. You abuse every movie that is seen as fun towards the public all for your money. Movies are made for entertainment! If you critics gave the 2016 Ghostbusters (4.7) positive scores to boost gender equality, I know why you did it, but your also liars, pretending to laugh at 'fart jokes?'.

906,jc-29071,Part two can be better,7,2 October 2016,"The story is that these guys are villains forced into becoming heroes, and on the way some learn that being a hero is worth more than they could know. There are some dark parts in the story, but they need to stray toward the good and redemption, while dealing with the dark aspects and second chances for some. This can work even better in part 2 if you stick more to this idea, to the very heart, the special effects have to be worked on, should be visually striking, killer Croc needs to be tweaked his role needs to be carefully handled to work right. Harley Quinn was phenomenal, so was the appearance of Batman.Also Wills character the side burns and the beard not the way to go,please a better look and a better more appropriate costume, in black preferably.Hey DC on the news recently, you say that Wonder woman is gay? Please, please stay far away from making her anti-male, feminist, or a homosexual, that kind of stuff is a big turn off and bad for business. Make her views on man's evil clear but let it be clear that she will always work side by side with man, to be his helper, his companion and to face every challenge with him together as one, then she will soar and so will the movie. Remember she is pure, this is at the heart of being a hero, not these anti-heroes, Wolverine (no hesitation to kill), Deadpool (a pervert, this is disgusting), Punisher(a deranged killer). Also what happened to the Comic Code Authority to protect children from the dangerous content of these crazy irresponsible writers, did you think we forgot, we didn't its going to keep coming back to DC and Marvel for being so irresponsible and uncaring about our children. You really think that being homosexual is the norm? Just because some male writers want to impress their girlfriends so they can have sex with them? When a sicko-perverted man rapes your little 4 year old son and screws up his head to make him think that he's a girl, are you going to be fine with making homosexuality mainstream, is that what you want to allow?! Or that equally as dangerous one of these predatory lesbians brainwashes your sweet, beautiful baby girl into hating all men, including her own father! All because she was raped, or badly mistreated by some troubled male to the point that she becomes confused and thinks all men are the same, and so tries to make everyone hate all men. I don't think so because if it happened to my son I would want that sick-o punished. So are we going to allow this deviant behavior to be allowed because someone who has a lot of money or knows top -people wants to force a change that is as crazy as selling guns to people with a history of violent offenses and mental illness. No I can't be silent, because silence=death remember. Now that will never be an excuse for anyone to attack or become violent to a person who is a victim of same sex rape, especially at an early age, who has been screwed up mentally and can no longer see the truth only anger because of the attacker or someone who just wants to be a homosexual. No, that will never do, but neither will your campaign to allow the acts of perversion to become mainstream, no! Never. I know some of you feel you have been born that way, there may be truth to this but if so it is a very rare occasion and not the norm and you can't go around trying to make it mainstream, its not going to be allowed, people will get tired of it and will rebel. Do what you do if this is the truth of your nature but don't try to force it on others. Also Nature says otherwise, the Lion does not mate with the Lion but with the Lioness and for the express and sole purpose of procreation and all other creatures follow suit, Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve.",Suicide Squad
907,zachariah-38164,A beautiful crash landing,7,3 August 2021,"First I'm going to speak bluntly on the topic that consumes the media around this film. Warner Bros took the masterpiece that was the original Suicide Squad, butchered and mutilated it then slapped David's name on it. Now this may not be the original cut or anything similar to it but in Warner Bros attempt to recreate the film to fit thier incredibly poor vision, they actually made a decent watchable film. There are so many parts of this film that I genuinely enjoy, lots of high octane action, wonderfully choreographed combat, character development, and that classic dark DC settings, but there are also many parts that just don't fit right. To the films credit it sure as hell is better than any Marvel movie out there (not made by Sony) so let's all prey we get the cut the director and the audience deserve. #releasetheayercut.",Suicide Squad
908,tagerjd,Try hard mess of a film.,2,19 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is not a movie as much as it is a buy product of items from Hot Topic. To quote YourMovieSucksDOTorg I found this movie to be 25 percent cringe worthy and 75 percent boring. As a fan of the comics it is genuinely insulting to see all of these dark character's be done in such of superficial way. Every character excluding the Joker was playing themselves and not the character's they are playing.The best part of this movie was the Joker in the sense that he was laughably bad. Every second that the Joker was on screen Jared Leto was trying so hard to be intimidating and insane that he just came off as an eccentric crime boss from the Simpsons. His performance was so over the top that if there was more of him in the movie I probably could have enjoyed this film as a so bad its funny, but that is unfortunately not the case.The primary problem with this movie is the fact that is has on over emphases on a dark color palate in this light tone. This was distracting in scenes were there was a lot of light and of fire. This is also the reason the film is an eye sore on a visual level. There were also a lot of unnecessary flash back sequence's that came out of no were. This would have distracted from the story if it was the least bit cohesive.People may argue that the movie was edited to death and there go it deserves to be cut slack. But in reality my point of view is if it is not in the movie its not in the movie. There are obvious cuts, and even cuts to black which shows there was no effort to conceal the cut.In conclusion this is nothing more then an inconsistent, tone shifting, and edited try hard film. However I can see how somebody could find entertainment from this movie If not only to see character's they like on the big screen. But as I look at this as a film it is horrible. And I'm giving this one a 2/10.",Suicide Squad
909,ethansanders-40501,What a disgrace,1,11 January 2017,"This is the worst superhero movie since catwoman (2004). I'm not going to beat around the bush with this one, this film was just flat out AWFUL!!!! Not only does this film feature the worst editing I have ever seen in a movie, low budget or otherwise, but the film is just fundamentally broken. The characters either have no depth (killer croc, boomerang, katana) or have inconsistent personalities and motivations that change whenever the plot requires them to (deadshot, Harley Quinn). They aren't even acted all that well either, with he exception of margot Robbie and viola Davis every performance in this film is just terrible. Even Will Smith who everyone bizarrely praised even though he is just playing himself and not a character. The plot couldn't make any less sense even if you tried to write something more incoherent. It makes no sense why the squad would at all be effusive in defeating any supernatural menace and characters disappear and reappear at random without any explanation. The action isn't even well filmed as the scenes are typically under lit with camera positioned awkwardly whilst the characters just mindlessly shoot things without any tension, rhyme or reason. The CGI is some of e worst CGI ever put to a movie, characters never interact in a convincing or compelling way and rap music is played randomly at inappropriate times ruining the tone the scene was going for. I could go on all day about how atrocious this ""product"" was but let me just say I agree with those people who think it dose'nt deserve he rotten tomatoes score it got (26%). I agree it deserved a lot lower.",Suicide Squad
910,alinfatu,Better than the last two yet it lacks sometimes,8,14 August 2016,"Concept:So the concept of assembling an all villain team of the worst criminals in the world to take on bigger threats is quite good and it was taken out of the comics and pretty well delivered.Plot:I always felt that Enchantress would turn bad at some point throughout the movie but never thought it would be the main villain do to Joker being heavily promoted.The plot was bland,a team of super-villains goes to stop the biggest threat,the witch, and her brother who now want to exterminate humanity because their kind is gone.The bait she used,their dreams becoming a reality was cliché.And I also did not understand why an all-powerful being needed to fight people who she could throw around using chants like a ninja.Characters(In the order the left an impact on me and had a good performance): 1)Amanda Waller:Viola Davis nailed the part and she represented an Amanda Waller that is intelligent,fierce and overall such a bitch to the extent that after you save her life she would blow you off.She was a strategist and paid no mind about who will die if the job gets done.2)Joker:Jared Leto did very well for the part he was given and while I feel sorry for him because his scenes were heavily cut off I need to point out what I liked and did not about him.His Joker was violent,obsessed with Harley,given the fact it was so early in their history and he was mad,he enjoyed a lot his lifestyle and he was a strategist,always knowing where to go and how to proceed in different situations.I did not like his laugh though and he lacked his jokes,he did not strike me as a particular funny Joker but I hope this will be addressed in the future.His look is modern and was inspired from various comics and from David Bowie and I must say he looked alright in my eyes.3)Dr. Harleen Quinzel/Harley Queen:Margot Robbie also nailed her part and she was given material to work with.She was crazy,a good fighter,unpredictable but with an anchor in the sane part.I did not agree with her being called crazier than the Joker because as we see later in her vision:She saw the Joker as a sane,cured man,deep down despite her love for her Puddin' she wanted a boring,fulfilled life.As for her doctor portrayal,she was pretty sexy that part,of course, we could say we found her like this because she was found of Mr. J and wanted to impress him.4)El Diablo:he was bland and boring to me until the third act where he really shined.His backstory in the bar scene really made me feel for him and I hope he will be back,he was one of the anchors of magic in the DCEU.His guilt is what saved the team, in the end,he accepted his fate and agreed to suffer the consequences.5)Katana:While a minor character,she was great.Her fighting style was on point and she displayed it well.I wanted to see her use the soul taker more and I felt bad when Warner Brothers decided to cut her two major supernatural based scenes:the soul taker display of power and her eyes turning pitch black.She had an emotional scene with Maseo though I would have wanted to hear him talk back.Karen's first role had a great impact for me and I want to see more of her in the future.6)Professor June Moon/The Enchantress:I must say they really went far to establish her as a dark,vicious witch from the ancient time.I liked Cara's portrayal,but I felt they should have gone with her third act look for the entire movie,the Mayan,Aztec goddess of magic.Her brother was added to the plot only to be her servant and save her from Amanda's threat because she almost killed her stabbing her heart.I wish we will see more of her and maybe next time they will let her unleash more spells.7)Deadshot:This was Will Smith as himself with a little twist in some scenes but this time he was enjoyable,he brought some of his fun and personality to the character and this made me like him more.His deep care for his daughter was kind of overused, though.Honorable Mentions:1)Captain Boomerang:He had a lot of potential but in the end felt as an untouched character,we could not feel for him,we could not see what made him come back,the only thing to be remembered by is his Pony.2)Killer Croc:While being King Shark's replacement he got the same treatment as Boomerang,his joke and overconfidence felt cringe and I hope he will be evolved into a more monstrous state in the future.3)Rick Flag:while a master strategist and an army pro his only purpose was to be a damsel in distress for the squad to save every time and his only connection was with June Moon.He felt really possessive to the extent where he would let the world end to save June.4)Slipknot:WAISTED CHARACTER.They should not introduce him just to use him as an example.Cameos: 1)Batman:It is always a delight to see Affleck's Batman in action and mostly to see him interact with more of his rogue gallery,not just the joker.My favorite cameo was nonetheless his chase after Joker and Harley.2)The Flash:I love the costume and he seems to start to embody Barry well,he can crack one or two jokes sometimes but he is serious and considered mostly. The editing:Warner Brothers seem to lack in confidence in their directors each time.Only because a select number of people did not like the darkness in the movie it doesn't mean it should have been funnier.As a side note, I must point out that to me it was not really funny.The third act was miserably edited and,to me it seemed it was re-shot completely and the cast looked tired and bored,just standing there,doing the stunts and delivering the lines,but some of the passion was gone.",Suicide Squad
911,chewitt-99762,What a terrible movie!!!!,1,27 July 2018,The problem with comic book villains on the big screen is that they're treated like anti-hero's instead of villains and that is exactly what this movie did. You get a movie that screws everything the comics put into these characters. No creativity in this film and a cringy bar scene. Why I'm the hell does El Diablo die by an explosion when he has flames as his power and can turn into a damn burning skeleton!! The DC Universe is definitely screwing up with these films and are trying to catch up to the MCU. Who would have expected that the villain would be Suicide Squad member Enchantress who does nothing in this film that causes a damage to any of the other Suicide members. Creating a damn machine to destroy humans when she can just wipe them out instead of wasting time. I was expecting action in this film but was stuck with watching a drama with so much talking. The Joker was pointless in this movie because he's not even a member of the Suicide Squad and Jared Leto cannot play the character right and is a disappointment to the comic book villain. Instead of looking at dangerous villains we're stuck with lame characters that are a waste of time to this Universe.,Suicide Squad
912,anaahnu,Mediocre,6,13 October 2016,"A soppy movie, full of sentimental suffering, mourning and all that popular now emo-stuff. In some episodes it does work, anyhow (Rick Flagg's relation with the Enchantress has poor chemistry, but the tear- jerking does save the day). In some episodes it just annoys (there is a little hope for some better Harley-Joker sequences in the extended cut, but I'm speaking now only of the theatrical version).The film has many action scenes, not to say great, but definitely proper ones. And there are some interesting personae, Cap'n Boomerang for instance (though he is a petty copy of Dedpool, some unpleasant charisma about him can be felt). And there are idiotic scenes with the Joker. If you came to see how Harley Quinn became his true attendant, you will not see it. She just falls in love with her psycho patient, because -- Well, because it was in the script. And so ends the story of the greatest love ever between two quirks: just not shown. As if there was nothing to show.I can't say the movie is really bad (Margo Robby does all to turn it from a foolish, sentimental story into something more interesting, even at the count of simple fan-service). This is just a movie to watch when you want rest and relax. Almost no sense, absolutely no idea, characters, as it were, are to be judged only by their outlooks.

917,dwarol,"As a movie, it's not bad",7,25 November 2020,"There's a lot of bitterness here over how the movie does not fulfill the DCU canon. But as someone who never read the comic books and doesn't care about the how true the movie is to the DCU, it's not a bad movie.In the movie the real villains are Waller and the rest of the US government. They're corrupt and far more ruthless than the Suicide Squad. In fact, the Squad are mainly victims of people like Waller. Seen this way, the characterizations of Deadshot, Quinn, and the others are true to the premise of the movie. Deadshot is not a cold-blooded assassin, he's somebody who's simply trying to survive the best way he can in this world and keep his daughter safe. The same for Diablo. Quinn is a bit different, she was created by the Joker who couldn't care less about her. While the Joker subplot is a distraction at times it serves the story of Quinn freeing herself from him and becoming her own person, the same as all the others who are trying to free themselves in this society.The action and story move forward in a straightforward way. I didn't find it muddled or confusing at all. It's standard fare for a superhero movie but it serves the plot. It moves the characters along.It took me a long time to watch this movie because of all the bad reviews it got. And since the movie was obviously marketed to DCU fans I understand the disappointment. It was a cynical ploy by the studio. But even so the movie still stands as an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours -- if you don't come with preconceptions.",Suicide Squad

To appeal to youngsters the producers were too afraid to make these villains evil..the result were actors trying their best to be threatening against the grain of script and story. This film is basically a superhero film with different anti heroes in different costumes..worst, the storyline is boring- the ending predictable and the musical score no different..bombastic with nowhere to go..just like the film..",Suicide Squad
919,dlo540,Such high hopes...,5,24 August 2016,"After I saw the 1st trailer for this film, I was very excited for the film. It looked so promising. Now here we are...let down. The film is average, at best. The story just does not add up at all, even when you try to piece it together. The mission that is described to the characters at the beginning of the film has a very confusing result, even when you try to go back and remember everything that happened and who said what.The characters are not bad at all...except The Joker. This is my least favorite interpretation of The Joker. It reminded me of Johnny Depp's 'Capt. Jack Sparrow' at times. The way he talked and laughed just didn't go together. Leto's acting coach should have pulled him to the side and said ""You need to work on this more."" Anyone involved in this movie should have told Leto ""...You really need to work on this more.""I enjoyed Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Diablo, Croc, and Boomerang. All solid performances, some tongue-in-cheek lines/moments, but that is the writers, not the actors.If you intend on seeing this film in theaters, brace yourself for a mediocre movie. This could have been so much better. DC Comics really need to sit back and think of their upcoming projects, rethink of their upcoming projects, and then think once more about how they are going to write and direct the upcoming films. The fans quality!!",Suicide Squad
920,solun-1,The best thing about this movie is probably a product placement by Samsung,2,17 April 2018,"I liked the performance of Jared Leto. Will Smith is pretty much the same as in any other movie but he is a good actor though in a pointless, not entertaining movie. The make-up is obviously good (especially if it won an Oscar) but you don't get to enjoy it much. The movie is completely predictable, performances of most actors average, in some cases below average. I was disappointed with Margot Robbie, she is a good actress but this role was for someone else. Only after watching the movie and reading the cast and crew, I realized there is no Mila Kunis in this but to me previously unknown Cara Delevingne. I think at 21 years old, I am too old for this movie, it was probably aimed at teenagers and kids. There is no violance, it all feels pale and plain boring. Overall, very disappointed. But the movie is a huge hit according to box office and I find it kind of sad that so many good films have no success but a thing like this does.",Suicide Squad
921,brianable,Loved it to a point,6,2 May 2021,"The first 3/4 of the film is absolutely brilliant. Exactly how a ""super"" movie should be built up and made. Unfortunately, the last big fight scene falls flat on his face with the overworking of Cara Delevingne's demonic performance (which wasn't too bad before that) with excruciating special effects made me wonder what the hell went wrong at this point.Will Smith and especially Margot Robbie were undoubtedly the stars here!",Suicide Squad
922,Pooyan1920,it was the best DC movie to this day.,8,5 August 2016,"it was the best DC movie to this day. all the cast except Cara Delevingne (she was really bad, it was obvious that they tried to cover her lake of acting skills with CGI and editing gadgets) were great. Viola Davis was amazing and of course Will Smith was great as The Deadshot. Margot Robbie proved herself as a great actress in this movie and Jared leto as Joker was interesting although he has not had much time on screen to prove himself as a real original Joker. the first half of the movie which introduced All the heroes and villains weren't that good. the screenplay has some major problem with creating the main Villain (Enchantress) which just gets worse with Cara Delevingne bad acting. the second half when our heroes actually start their mission we get to see a good, amusing, funny, Heroic and tragic superhero movie which what we all want. in general the movie was great and thank god we're not gonna see any DC movie with Zack Snyder as its director for a while.",Suicide Squad
923,HippieMoon94,"Not The Best, But Not The Worst",6,8 August 2016,"I went into this movie with extremely high hopes because of the promising commercials I had seen everywhere. However, I was sorely disappointed as I sat through what quickly became a train wreck of a film. I'm not gonna lie, all of the characters had definite potential upon introduction, but as they were haphazardly lumped together and thrown into a fight they were severely unprepared for the minuscule background info the audience was given about each ""bad-guy"" seemed out of place and pasted on. The plot was shaky, at best, and supplied me with a generous amount of unanswered questions. A few of which being: where is captain boomerang during MOST of the fighting scenes; why did Waller have workers (the ones she shot) handling information that was above their pay-grade; why did Enchantress engage in hand-to-hand combat as opposed to simply blasting them all to smithereens the first time they refused her offer during the last big fight scene; etc.The set-up for MOST of the characters was not believable in the slightest. We got NO backstory for killer croc. They spent so little time on him that there were times when I forgot he was even a part of the team at all. Cap Boomerang was completely unsuited for this particular situation at all considering that the only weapons he had to work with were his trusty-dusty boomerangs which rendered him completely useless against the supernatural forces they were facing. Katana a.k.a. silent, sword-wielding place-holder because she pretty much had no purpose in the group except to protect Flagg who couldn't be killed by the Squad anyway because he made it extremely clear that if he died then they died. Slipknot was so obviously only in the movie to be killed off. Diablo was a pacifist the entire movie in order to provide a semi-logical reason for most of the excessive shooting scenes considering he could have just roasted most of the attackers in a matter of seconds. Deadshot tried so hard to make you feel for his ""I want to be a good guy for my daughter"" plight that it was hard to see him as a villain bad enough for this crew at all. And I saved the ""best"" for last, Harley & Joker. They were both a mess. Joker didn't fit into this picture at all because his entire role was built as Harley's big bad boyfriend who spent the whole movie ""coming for you, baby."" His scenes were forced and unnecessary. Harleen Quinzel, usually one of my favorite characters, was fun enough but severely lacking in on screen presence. Everything about this particular Harley seemed forced and fake, especially when her ""perfect vision"" turned out to be both her and Joker cured with young babies. Harley is classically a psychopath and for her to have a ""normal"" life vision left me with some serious questions about why she stayed Harley at all when Joker wasn't around. Their entire relationship was unfamiliar to me having only previously seen the cartoon adaptations of their relationship. The main villain, Enchantress, was a hot mess. Her character was unbelievable, but that could be in part due to the inexperience of the fairly new actress, Cara Delevigne, portraying her. Unfortunately, the unbelievability of her character also was a let down because of the awkwardly forced relationship between her and Rick Flagg. I didn't believe their love affair for a second. They were too stiff around each other and their ""love"" wasn't fleshed out enough in the backstory scenes for me. Overall, the movie wasn't the best DC movie I've ever seen, but it also wasn't the worst. It has humorous and fun-loving parts, but it also leaves the audience with a ton of unanswered questions (and not in a ""I need more"" kind of way). I definitely recommend that people who think they'll enjoy this movie to watch it for sure, but go in expecting a sloppy movie because if you go in expecting anything more than mediocre then you're gonna get your feelings hurt.",Suicide Squad
924,dave118118,A nice idea executed with slapdash laziness,5,23 August 2016,"Not nearly as bad as the critics are saying but it's certainly not good. This story about a bunch of misfit outcasts being thrown together feels strangely, thrown together. There have been reports that David Ayer penned the screenplay in just 6 weeks which would go someway to explaining the disjointed nature of the film. It is also common knowledge that there were plenty of re-shoots to ensure that Suicide Squad didn't fall into the pitfalls and traps of Batman vs Superman's overbearing murkiness. The aim was to inject some much needed humour into the caliginous world of the DC universe. Instead we end up with questionable editing and one liners which rarely raise a chuckle, often misfiring completely.A few re-writes and I really think they would've had something here. I really enjoyed the character introductions, with their fast funky visuals and vibrant graphics. The performances mostly range from OK to good, with Jai Courtney surprising everyone with his Aussie Capt Boomerang. It's just a shame the final act is an absolute, wince inducing farce. As are all Harley Quinn and Joker scenes. Leto's joker and Delevingne's Enchantress are the worst things in the film by a mile.I've seen Leto's joker described as 'the worst iteration of the joker so far' which isn't fair, as that would suggest there have been other terrible Joker's in the past. This is the first bad portrayal of the joker I've heard of... and it's woeful.A nice idea executed with slapdash laziness. A baby step up from Batman vs Superman but a step up none-the-less.",Suicide Squad
925,KD-Lasso,"Another ""superhero"" movie......",3,2 August 2016,"Let me preface this by saying that I did enjoy Batman v Superman the first time I saw it in theaters. So don't down vote me because you think I'm some kind of Marvel fanboy(I can count on one hand the amount of MCU films I actually enjoyed)..But this is not a great movie. Already the ""fans""(read: fanboys) are outraged that it is getting bad reviews, but the fact is: It's getting bad reviews because it deserves it. It's a story about a group of people with special powers that has to learn to work together to stop a generic CGI army and close some kind of portal/hole in the sky. Just like The Avengers, X-Men: Apocalypse, similar to Man Of Steel, yeah a bunch of movies have done this.It starts out with a series of flashy montages that went on way too long, all of a sudden something happens and they skip ahead a bunch of chapters in a couple minutes. The pacing issues luckily ends there, and the second act is pretty enjoyable. One of the best characters from the first half of the movie disappears though which sucks, they could have solved that in a different way to keep the character in play. The third act is where it goes full on generic ""superhero"". And then it stops short. No real aftermath or anything.It does have a post credit scene, but it is totally negated by them dropping the Justice League trailer a couple weeks ago.",Suicide Squad
926,samcro69,Two words. Harley Quinn!,7,2 December 2018,"I gave this film a rating of 6 because Margot Robbie has 6 letters in her first and last names. The reason behind this is because she is the ONLY reason to watch this film! Plain and simple, Harley Quinn steals EVERY scene in this film! Forget about Jared Leto's Joker, he pales in comparison to Ledger's Dark Knight Crown Prince of Crime! This film is ALL Margot! From her hair to her HOT shorts to absolute Joker smile. This film is 100% Harley Quinn!",Suicide Squad

Superman: Dawn of Justice, Deadpool and Ghostbusters, Suicide Squad is truly one of the worst films of 2016. It was no better, no worse than Batman VS. Superman: Dawn of Justice. It was not a very good film. Will Smith and Margot Robbie gave good performances and Margot Robbie really got into character as Harley Quinn and she very much the role her own. Jared Leto was an Okay Joker, but he tried too hard to top Heath Ledger's performance. Jai Courtney is truly one of the world's worst actors and again gives another average performance. The cast didn't have a good on-screen chemistry. The film was a mess. It very much ripped off Guardians of the Galaxy and The Avengers. Ben Affleck and Ezra Miller's cameos as Batman and The Flash were wasted and wasn't enough to save the film. What a shame! Suicide Squad could had been better. It is one of the worst films of 2016 and one of the worst films we've had in the last 7 years.",Suicide Squad
928,christineyoon,"Suicide Squad: contagious, phenomenal, shocking, worth seeing",8,1 October 2016,"""Suicide Squad"" watchers will leave the theater crazed by the elements of ""freakiness"" from the members of the Suicide Squad. The Suicide Squad is a team of ""anti-heroes"", central characters that lack the conventional ""heroic"" attributes; the members are comparable to Marvel's Deadpool, with dark personality traits and cruel humor. The Suicide Squad stands at a stark contrast to the Avengers, lacking the same honor and nobility held by the team of heroes. Rather, the Squad teamed up, reluctantly, by their common vice, crime, in order to fight against higher crime. These members were connected via their common wickedness by a secret government agency to fight against a higher evil which would destroy their world, something they were not ready to give up. This recurrent theme of villainous behavior in the film, uncommon in superhero movies, is new and unpredictable to audiences, and is probably the reason to the success of ""Deadpool"" and now ""Suicide Squad"".Portraying the anti-heroes, the actors in this film practiced ""method acting"", in which they stay in character both on- and off-camera. While typically applied for deeply emotional, maudlin movies, method acting was employed by the actors in order to achieve the madness typical of the criminal characters. For example, in order to find the perfect ""creepy"" Joker laugh, Jared Leto publicly tried different laughs, seeing which ones made people the most uncomfortable. In addition, to continue the deranged mentality of the Joker, he sent presents to his co-stars, including a live rat to Margot Robbie, bullets to Will Smith, and a dead hog to the entire crew. Fellow actor Scott Eastwood mentioned that Leto frightened him at times with his unsettling behavior. Leto is previously known for his method acting in his appraised, Oscar- winning role in ""Dallas Buyers Club"". Will Smith, preparing for his role as Deadshot, shaved his head, trained with Navy SEALS and Army Rangers, and practiced firing guns and rifles. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who plays Killer Croc, delved into his character, even observing actual crocodiles and researching about cannibalism.""Suicide Squad"" has received mixed reception, ranging from worst to best. Audiences have rated the film low for its lack of plot organization and uneven screen time among the characters. The plot, at times, seems confusing, as it jumps around and continues without answering obvious questions such as why certain characters were unhurt or how they survived, how one scene connected to the next, etc. In addition, characters such as Enchantress, Harley Quinn and Amanda Waller received an excessive amount of screen time compared to other characters such as Katana and Joker. Certainly, the time of the droning parts of recurring characters could have been allotted to other characters such as Joker, which the audience wanted to see more of. While critical watchers may judge the movie negatively, those looking for a fun, energetic film will not be disappointed by ""Suicide Squad"". Positive critics have praised the film for its thrills, cast, and originality. The film is filled with action, and doesn't waste too much time on dull flashbacks or profound pasts typical of other movies. Rather, it sticks to the present, with small bits of flashbacks to give the audience insight into the personal histories of main characters such as Harley Quinn, Deadshot, and Joker and their true, intrinsic motivations for their decisions. The cast, including Will Smith (Deadshot), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), Jared Leto (Joker), Viola Davis (Amanda Waller), Jai Courtney (Captain Boomerang), and Cara Delevingne (Enchantress), were fit for their roles, with the right amount of psychiatry and lunacy important for each character. Margot Robbie received praise, especially, for her nearly-genuine expression of mania as Harley Quinn. She brings novelty to the movie as a charming yet lunatic, strong female character who draws in the audience with each unpredictable comment and action. The positive reception of Harley Quinn has led to the possibility of a future Harley Quinn movie.""Suicide Squad"" is an entertaining film for all audiences, and it satisfies the expectations of comic book fans. While its main purpose is to entertain, it does leave the audience with the idea of the strong female role, by actresses Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Karen Fukuhara (Katana). In typical superhero films such as the ""Avengers"" and ""Iron Man"", women play weaker, non-central roles in which they contribute insignificantly or play the ""girlfriend"" or the ""wife"". Recent series such as ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" also have the strong female hero, but ""Suicide Squad"" is one of the first and few films of the comic book genre to bring the female character to the most central light. In the movie, Harley Quinn was the focus of attention. While Deadshot and Rick Flagg had a great amount of action, Harley Quinn had the main, comedic commentary, was the voice of reason to connect the group, and was the hero to make the final, deciding action to save the Squad and the entire world from apocalyptic takeover. This was also a turning point in Margot Robbie's career, just after playing the ""damsel-in-distress"" role as Jane Porter in ""The Legend of Tarzan"". The other female character, Karen Fukuhara, defies cultural odds in ""Suicide Squad"" by bringing Asian diversity and changing the typical ""normal"" person role of the Asian woman into the tough, rebellious fighter. Rather, she has brought the Asian female into the role of fighter, which is rare in comic book movies. ""Suicide Squad"" serves as a form of entertainment for the average audience, but it does carry the inconspicuous message of female strength.",Suicide Squad

930,dave_maguire,Meh...!,5,22 August 2016,"So whilst being more of a Marvel fan I in no way hate DC and, despite not really enjoying the past 2 DC films I still wanted to see this one, especially given the polar opposite reviews that it had been getting. And my feeling by the credits was ""Meh, it was alright""..Whilst the film wasn't the worst one I've seen, there was nothing in it to amaze me. It is clear that the film has had a lot of re-shoots and the editing of the film is pretty poor, with scenes jumping from one to another without any thought to the flow of the story - half of scenes from the trailers aren't even in the film either?!The film seems to suffer in it's failure to deal with a big group of main characters, where the Avengers gave everyone similar screen time, only Harley and Deadshot get a lot, (And for some reason also have 2 intro's?) Will Smith is basically Mike Lowry as Deadshot and takes a lot of the screen time, but I guess he is the big name so you would expect so, whilst Margot Robbie also takes a lot of time, but is probably the most well known character so again you'd expect her to be in the foreground, and I enjoyed the flashbacks between her and the joker. But I did keep noticing that her voice/accent kept changing throughout the film though from the normal tone, to a randomly serious voice, to a ""bubblegum"" accent - but this might be down to her being crazy, which I thought was potryed well on screen. But aside from these two other team members just appear, Katana randomly gets on the helicopter before they leave and her back story is literally explained in 1 or 2 sentences by Rick Flag, whilst the other main culprit is Slipknot, who gets out of a van, punches a woman, then is tricked in to trying to escape and gets his head blown off?? What was the point in even putting him in the film? You just don't ever get to a point where you really care about any of the team. I would've like to have seen more of the other characters developed, Captain Boomerang is actually quite funny but isn't on a great deal, and you'd easily forget that Killer croc is in the film. El Diablo was an intriguing character who'd I'd have liked to have seen more of but they decide to kill him off no sooner than he starts fighting.The Joker doesn't really have a place in the film, he adds nothing to the plot really and is almost just an extended cameo to pay fan service - though again I guess you can't have Harley without him?? Interesting take on the character though, but just really appears to be a bog standard mob boss with green hair, nothing against Leto but I don't think the character is a patch on any of the previous incarnations.The Enchantress is a strange character, and by strange I mean rubbish. Amanda Waller makes a big deal about how she can control her as she has her heart but she basically turns as soon as the film starts and after resurrecting her brother he saves her from getting killed straight after when her heart is stabbed?! Then after complaining to her brother that they humans now worship machines, not magic she decides to kill them all...by building a machine?! But this is also never explained any further as to what this machine actually is or will do to the world?! Really poor bad guy, her brother is pretty awful too, in both substance and visually, with the special effects looking awful especially in this day and age - it reminded me of a cross between Tron Legacy and Lawnmower man?! (And I don't even know how that's possible?!). Amanda Waller is a much more fearsome villain in the movie and is played very well.Couple of other little annoyances/questions that I won't delve in to but which aren't explained.-Who shoots down the helicopters (every single one of them..!) and keeps shooting at the soldiers? They explain that the Enchantress is turning men, women & children into mindless zombie kind of creatures so where are the guns?-After spending the entire film avoiding fighting, why when Diablo decides to fight does he have to ask permission from Deadshot?-How does Harley manage to cut out Enchantress's heart by just slashing her across the chest with a sword? Wouldn't she need to actually stab her and cut that out?-Why does Harley Quinn go back to prison afterwards despite having her nanobomb disabled by the Joker?All in all though not the worst film you'll see, but it's certainly not one of the best and don't expect it to make you any more excited about the Justice league films - DC has got a LOT of work to do to save the DCEU. Good luck Wonder woman!",Suicide Squad
931,info-15-396609,Best Cult Film in over 30 years.,10,7 August 2016,"I mean that in the best possible way. For me, culture altering ""Cult Films"" are the most difficult to write and make. When they work, they last forever in a way no other genre can. Why do I say this? Because, using humor, philosophy and politics, they engrave archetypes into the collective consciousness, as I said, in a way that no other form can. Let's start here: Suicide Squad's incredibly strong Black and Female characters smashed the molds for what we usually see in film. Not that there haven't been others who have done awesome work, but the characters and performances in Suicide Squad have widened the parameters and opened doors that will never again be closed. Margot Robbie, in my opinion gave the first screen performance by a female that defied gender. That doesn't mean that Charlize Theron or Sigourney Weaver and other notable bad ass women haven't done amazing work, what it means is, the combination of the role given to Ms. Robbie, and her ability to take it to the absolute limit and beyond, have resulted in a total game changer. Ladies, the floor is now open, no more holds barred. Thank you to the writers, directors and producers who had the vision to allow Ms. Robbie, to take the role and run with it. Will Smith? Really? I mean, I do love him, but now I have so much more respect. That was one hell of a role to make work even without being true to source material. He grounded the film in so many ways. Viola Davis? What a surprise secret weapon she is in this film. Fresh and brilliant... once again a brand new avenue for female actors. Jared Leto? I know you all have your favorite Joker, but I'm sorry, his take was villain hall of fame level for detail and originality. Look, I could go on and on about each character, but this was an ensemble that fed off each other brilliantly. And here's the other thing about Cult Films for me... The rendering: from cinematography, to CGI, to make up, to wardrobe, to music (the music was flawless) to direction... must be very serious and of a high quality. That's the irony that makes it work; the contrast between the ""off the cake"" story and the very real production details. And let me tell you, the producers of Suicide Squad went all the way in every department. This movie is not for critics, it's for real people who love good film making, film making with joy and heart and imagination. Thanks guys. I can't wait for the next film!",Suicide Squad
932,anfalarshad,Answer to the negative reviews,8,7 August 2016,"This is not a movie for your average movie goer. This is a movie for your comic book fans. People who actually know these characters, and don't expect them to act like their watered down Nolan counterparts (or how they'd behave if they had a Nolan counterpart). People who will actually get all the little references and easter eggs. Like the Alex Ross nod? That was brilliant. And amongst comic book fans, this movie is great. The Joker was, for the first time, the clown prince of crime. Harley was manipulative and cunning. Captain Boomerang was absolutely hilarious. Deadshot was greatly portrayed and had a ton of depth to him. Amanda Waller was probably the scariest character in the whole movie because she wasn't crazy and didn't have a motive, she was just cold. Even the small part Ben Affleck played, you got to see the softer side of Batman and his compassion for all life.

Let's hope so.Cliché after cliché and a set of characters that were so poor that any actor that appeared in this tosh will have to do something sensational to recover their reputations. Mind you considering the rubbish that's produced currently, appearing in this ridiculous movie may not be a problem.So were there any redeeming aspects to this movie? Not really although the special effects were OK. The music made it seem like a series of music videos that were separated by a music score.

934,kubapawlowski,Was it worth the hype?,5,16 August 2016,"Suicide Squad. Probably one of the most anticipated blockbuster movies this summer.Due to mostly the great advertising, and that second trailer which was what dc fans wanted out of this movie.I am writing this review from the perspective of a big dc fan, comics, games, movies... EVERYTHING!!! So going in I saw more or less what I expected. A movie about a bunch of criminals forcibly brought together to carry out a mission that will most likely get them killed. Plus a villain who was basically Gozer from Ghostbusters. What I love about this movie are the characters (especially Deadshot and Harley) everyone is unique in their own way, I mean we have a guy on the team who uses boomerangs as a weapon!! So seeing the interactions between them creates a lot of interesting and funny dialogue. But it was disappointing seeing characters such as killer Croc only having about 3 lines. Along with that there wasn't much development for characters apart from Harley, Deadshot and El Diablo, sure we get brief exposition of the other squad members but it was very brief. OH, and lets not forget about the joker. He wasn't in it long but I liked him from what was shown. Sense of style; questionable. But he did have a very good joker voice and personality down.The overall quality of the film did lack some, there were cuts that didn't make that much sense. The action was overall good but at least we there wasn't much or any in fact shaky cam. Which I wouldn't really expect much of from David Ayer in the first place. However from the guy that made Fury I was expecting better film making than this, but I expect a lot of it was due to WB taking stuff out from the movie.Nonetheless it was very entertaining (to me at least) and was paired with an amazing soundtrack, tons of Easter eggs and great characters. So for me it was worth the hype.",Suicide Squad
935,nanciabutt,Don't make a judgment without watching it.,7,4 November 2016,First of all the actors did a good job.Specially Will Smith of course as dead shot.Robbie also did a marvelous job portraying the infamous Harley Quinn.Other actors also did fine.Yeah the plot was weak.It could have been a better movie but still it was better than some very hit Marvel movies.It seemed that they were rushing the movie especially at the end.The end was not unique it was traditional.Moreover there was no good twist in the movie.You could guess the whole plot in first ten minutes.As far as joker is concerned Jared did neither a great nor a bad job.He was fine but the expectations after Heath Ledger were too high.He clearly didn't meet them.The CGI was a bit childish.Overall still you will enjoy your time if you watch it despite of these reviews of the critics.So go watch it.,Suicide Squad

937,azeron40,Suicide Squad had Potential,6,18 September 2016,"I wish I could have said 10/10 but what we were sold, was not that. I know that movies must be edited for time, and it already ran for 123min including Credits. Maybe they should have made it a 2 part movie, although I tend to hate those in principle. According to Jared Leto ""During an interview with BBC Radio 1, Leto told Edith Bowman ""there's probably enough footage"" for the Joker to have a movie of his own."" Not that I wanted 2 more hours of the Joker in this movie. My point is this, overall there was terrible editing, parts of the movie seen in trailers even those that were fun, yet cut, and yes I know this happens in other movies. Most likely to get you to buy a Blu-ray later.Then to add insult to injury, they make Suicide Squad into a PG-13 parody of itself. In my opinion, they went the wrong direction with Deadshot. Will Smith can act, but the jovial way in which the character was played did not work. Why was Slipknot even on the team, spoiler just to show you, they can and will blow your head off, but the worst thing were the the altered humans they fought, it had no impact.As most say, Margot Robbie did quite well, and made Harley Quinn her own. I also believe that Jay Hernandez created a wonderful interpretation of Diablo, even with his limited scenes. Jared Leto's Joker portrayal was very entertaining, and spot on. I am not going to comment on all of the cast, most were were fine or better.DC Entertainment needs to get its act together. With the inflated budget, due to unused footage and therefore sets. Second guessing editing. Re-wrights for popular and influential actors, and likely, very highly paid. They are diminishing their profit margin, therefore, making it less likely they will continue the brand.

939,Lacheist,Fine popcorn movie,7,20 February 2020,I was in mid teen when i watched it so for me it was enjoyable. But later I find out to be quite a mediocre movie with not very interesting storyline.(2017),Suicide Squad
940,Spacenaz,Disappointing and Boring!,4,27 December 2016,"I just watched this movie and thought it was pretty bad. It has a boring story that takes like an hour to even develop. All of the characters are introduced, for whatever reason, because none of them are are really used to propel the movie forward. What was the purpose of half of them even in the movie? The Aussie, Katana, and Croc Man were all just basically extras in this movie for no reason. This movie basically stars Will Smith, who I am generally a fan of, and Margot Robbie who I am liking more and more. They starred together in 2015's Focus, which I enjoyed quite a bit and gave a 7. Will Smith gives his regular recent Will Smith action performance, something like Hancock mixed with After Earth. He is fighting to see his daughter again. While Margot Robbie is clearly the highlight of this movie with her hotness throughout, she is also one of the worst parts with all the terribly annoying dialogue they give her! Seriously, she has got to have some of the most annoying, clichéd lines I've seen in recent movies. This unfortunately made her character unlikable. I don't understand why they had to make her character so dumb and annoying when she is supposed to be a psychiatrist... I know some of her lines were meant to be funny but they pretty much all fell flat. Another highlight of this movie is Viola Davis in a pretty bad ass role for her as the leader of the squad, by force. She does her job well, and I am glad to see her in more and more big roles. The rest of the cast does a passable job moving this over blown budget monster through the motions. Jared Leto does an annoying Joker too, hideous makeup, and he just doesn't come across as ""menacing"".The story was boring like I said... Some witch wants to take over the world...And these magical special effects... I just didn't dig the whole magic world, crushing the heart, whatever lore it was about... It just didn't feel like the Gotham world, even though Batman (Ben Affleck) appeared in it. It felt like some supernatural movie or something, not a comic book movie. I am generally a fan of comic book movies, but I feel they have been overdone for about 10 years, with no relief in sight. I am not that familiar with the Suicide Squad comics, so I didn't really connect with any of the characters. I wanted to like Joker, with how hyped he was before the movie was released, but I just didn't. I don't rate anything a 1 or a 2, those types of movies don't really get green lit for major Hollywood budgets. The only thing I might rate 1 or 2 would maybe be some poorly edited Youtube trash or something. I haven't seen a movie yet that I would rate a 1. I do dislike Suicide Squad though, and probably won't watch it again. I may check out the sequel though, because I want to see if they will improve Joker's story line next time out. My lowest rated Hollywood movie so far was V/H/S Viral and I gave that a 3...That movie was terrible. This movie was pretty bad, but it had pretty good production values, great costumes, and some OK special effects. Watch at your own risk, you've been warned. 4/10",Suicide Squad

Then when it tries to be fun and quirky you get tonal whiplash that somehow makes you miss the boring grim-dark tone.

945,meshjoy,A Good Villains Movie With Too Much Hate,7,15 August 2016,"When I saw the trailers for this movie, I was REALLY excited. Joker, Harley Quinn, and a bunch of other DC baddies banding together? How freaking awesome is that?! Plus, Queen music! The final result, to me anyway, was a flawed, but good movie. First, I'll point out the good bits.I think Margot Robbie was EXCELLENT as Harley Quinn. She nailed the accent, as well as her psychotic nature. I could also tell that her love for Joker was genuine, and didn't feel like forced acting. If they really are making a movie on Harley Quinn, I would definitely love to see Robbie reprise her role. And speaking of Joker, I actually really liked Jared Leto's performance. I can acknowledge that his performance wasn't nearly as legendary as Heath Ledger's or Mark Hamill's, but he puts his own twist onto the Joker that makes him stand out in his own unique way. Will Smith was also very good as Deadshot. I was rooting for him, and felt sympathetic for him. He also had a few funny moments. I also really liked Katana. Her backstory on her and her sword were very interesting, and I wanted to learn more about her. As for the humor, there were some funny bits here and there. Most of the humor, for me, came from Croc, Harley Quinn, and Deadshot.As for the bad, well, I guess I'll start with the editing. It was very obvious that scenes were cut out. A lot of the scenes shown in the trailers weren't even in the movie. I was left confused as to why they were cut out, and disappointed. What I was also disappointed about was the lack of Joker. I know he wasn't in the Suicide Squad, but the trailer had me believing that he would play a big role in the film. All he did was drool over Harley, ""die"" off screen, then show up at the end. Very disappointing. I also wasn't too fond of how Leto spoke as Joker. Most of his dialogue was grunts, or he spoke through his teeth and I wouldn't be able to understand what he said most of the time. Most of the villains aside from Deadshot and Harley Quinn are shoved in the background. They're either there for comedic relief, or just because the comics said they had to be there. I was especially disappointed by Katana not having much use. As I said, she seemed very interesting, but she didn't play a big role. The plot itself seemed predictable, and I was instantly reminded of other movies that had similar plots. The villain wasn't that interesting to me, and I was honestly bored whenever she was on screen.So, while this film had its flaws, I still enjoyed it. I didn't feel like I wasted money on it. Would I watch it again? Probably. Do I think this movie deserves the hate it's been getting? Hell no. I think people hate it, mainly DC fans, because they all were excited by the trailers, and were left disappointed. I know how you all feel, but as I said, this doesn't deserve so much hatred. Besides, the director's cut is sure to have what was cut out from the film, and I bet that'll be worth watching more than the theatrical release.",Suicide Squad
946,shauni15,"completely misses the point, bigger is not always better",6,7 August 2016,"When i first heard that suicide squad was being made into a movie i was ecstatic, suicide squad is one of my favorite parts of the DC comic world and Harley Quinn has been my favorite comic book character ever since Batman TAS, and this was gonna be her first appearance on a live action movie, so safe to say i was really looking forward to this, and the trailers got me even more excited. What i didn't expect was how much different the movie would be.Somehow everyone seems to think that comic book/superhero movies today have to be HUGE, that the entire world should be at peril, with enormous CGI monsters fighting around a huge sky beam and generic faceless CGI armies swarming our heroes. What writer/director David Ayer completely misses about the Suicide Squad is that the precise reason why they're so great is because they're not big, they're usually small time/mid-tier villains on a small time/mid-tier mission that might have some connection to something bigger but it's usually very contained and personal. They don't ""save the world"" they merely participate.The movie starts off great, we have well paced comic book style character introductions, in a fun and enjoyable way, we understand them(mostly) we have dialogues crackling with quips and jokes and the movie's tone overall seems darkly comical, and it seems like DC has finally got it down, but then the story starts.we have some huge powerful magical generic evil monsters with their generic evil plans sending generic faceless armies and trying to destroy the whole world, and it's up to a guy that has good aim, a psychotic girl with a baseball bat, a guy with boomerangs, a slightly stronger human crocodile hybrid, a guy that can shoot some fire but doesn't really want to, and a girl with a sword to stop them. Wait what? how the hell are they gonna do that?That's not the suicide squad, suicide squad is about small covert missions to steal some plans or neutralize some smaller threats, they don't fight literal gods nor should they, that's their charm, that their stories are small and you can just focus on the characters and enjoy them.I hate to bring up Marvel to compare cos i know they're different blablabla, but remember Ant-man? That whole movie was just a heist film, break into here, steal a weapon, get out and fight a guy around a house. It didn't have the need to have the whole world about to explode, it was a small contained story and that's what made it great, and that's exactly how suicide squad should be. You could've just had the joker as the villain or something.Another big problem is that the movie has this tendency to shift tones so fast that you wonder if two separate guys were making the movie. One moment it's funny and enjoyable, the next everything is super serious and they just don't mash together. It feels like DC had a great, fun style but they just didn't wanna fully commit to it and it had to have those dour joyless elements of the previous two films, which dragged it down a lot.What i will say is that all the casting and performances are fantastic, Will smith is the same Will Smith we all love, Jai Courtney is surprisingly hilarious when he finally gets to play an Aussie, Margo Robbie is a great Harley Quinn, shes got the voice, the attitude and the general feel of the character down. Jared Leto is solid as the Joker you can really tell he committed despite being criminally underused and Joel Kinnaman is great as the straight man in all the madness.The actors and their characters basically salvage this wreckage of a story and make it mildly enjoyable, if all of them return in a movie where the story is much smaller and we can just enjoy their interactions without having to worry about the entire world exploding any second, i'm gonna be the happiest man alive and the first to pay for the ticket.",Suicide Squad
947,Cees-Timmerman,Very Bad,4,30 July 2021,"Too many characters. Instead of repeating scenes and using slow mo and quick cuts for drama, improve the dialogue and explain why the audience should care about what's happening.

948,akinchris84,Thanks but no thanks.,3,4 August 2016,"Possible spoilersI went in the movie with reservations, I heard negative reviews, I heard good ones. As always I make my own judgment afterwards.First and foremost, this is probably the worst and most over dramatized version of the Joker I have ever seen in my life. I was raised in comic books, they tried entirely too hard to make Joker look crazy. It seemed way too forced, he and Harley Quinn both look more like junkies than psychopaths. Not to mention they horribly botched the relationship of Jokers impression of Harley. I have no idea what they were aiming for and even less of an idea on why Jared Leto accepted that role. Harley Quinn, again they spent way too much time and effort making her a sex symbol and made her look like some white trash/hood rat combo with minor Harley Quinn traits.Deadshot, honestly, this was where I held most my reservations. I didn't like the idea of Will Smith in comic movies, but I think he did a fantastic job. The claim that Margot Robbie stole the screen just doesn't seem right as the movie centered more on the changes that he made as well as the leadership role he acquired.Killer Croc, I don't even know here. This was just plain bad in so many ways. I will just leave this one alone.Boomerang or whatever he was called, yet another utterly useless character I half expected to be killed off. Like the Joker in this movie he was a try hard with no real desire to see again.Katana, yes because who doesn't like having someone show up that doesn't speak a lick of English. You know the very language that the rest of the movie was in.Flag, no depth of a non-""meta human"" kinda expected more than a minimal love story.The enchantress wasn't bad when she wasn't doing some weird fish like dance moves.Plot, terrible. Outside of the focus on Deadshot the plot seriously lacked. Why would you bring Batman into a movie for parts yet he keeps himself away from a several day long battle, especially with his decision to make a team after the doomsday problem.I would have scored this movie lower if it wasn't for the occasional Harley Quinn like characteristics and the fact that Will Smith shined pretty well.Whoever wrote some of those scripts and designed the characters should be exiled from Hollywood.",Suicide Squad
949,t-ploegstra,Predictable...,5,14 March 2020,"Predictable as hell from minute 2 of the movie and due to the whole storyline. Don't even mention the plot...
Although i liked most of the cast.. Will Smith should be banned from comic movie's at all.DC should GIVE the rights back to Marvel!",Suicide Squad
950,tk-to-dj,Why have the Suicide squad when all you need is Deadshot?,6,5 August 2016,"I've seen this film 3 times already so I have the jist of the movie. My favourite lead singer is in this film Jared Leto, my expectation were high because of the off set craziness e.g. The gifts, never leaving character etc. This film is rather disappointing. Let's start with the Joker (Jared Leto). The joker is one of many reasons why I wanted to see this film. When I saw the comic-con trailer I was very excited to see the joker and what his role would be in this movie. In this film, he's in it for at least 15 minutes. Jared Leto Joker suited this film like how Jack Nicolson and Heath Ledger did too. I would like to see more of Jared's joker, 15 minutes is not enough. He really didn't do much in this film, sure he's the mob boss, he had power but that was it. Some scenes from the trailer didn't show up in the film too.Moving towards to Deadshot (Will Smith). I have to praise Will smith as he more or less carried this film alone. The star of the show, a true leader. His recent films like ""Concussion"" and ""Focus"" weren't his greatest but this film was he made up for it. Deadshot did everything. He over shadows Rick flag leadership, killed more Eye of Anversary than all of them put together and he defeated Enchantress. Which comes to my point why did Amanda Waller need the others?Harley Quinn (Marrgot Robbie). I love Harley Quinn, she's amazing on the big screen. I particularly liked the relationship between her and pudding. They got Harley Quinn right. Her back story was cut short, the scene where she stops the Joker, gets slapped and make out with him, that scene wasn't there.I could go on praising actors and actresses but let's get to the point.Amanda Waller pitches an idea of creating a team of villains with bombs planted on their necks and send them off to do suicidal missions, hence why it's called suicide squad. The Task force chases after a rogue Enchantress who creates a machine that will end the world. Let's start with Enchantress, how Amanda Waller controls Enchantress is by her heart that she keeps safe in a brief case. The idea is that if she does go rogue, she can kill her heart killing Enchantress, simple. What happens is Enchantress is able to find her brother's soul fairly quickly, feed it to a human, let his brother take over and destroy the city. Enchantress borrows her brothers powers to survive without her heart until she retrieves it from Amanda. She does retrieve her heart and kidnaps Amanda and uses her knowledge to destroy top secret locations from the government. Enchantress has many powers one of them is she can teleport/ blink. There's one scene where she blinks to Amanda when she's sleeping with the brief case. Why didn't Enchantress blink away with her heart? How did she not know about the explosive devices on the suicide squad's necks. She was at the meeting and she gathered information from Amanda at the end. Harley Quinn did nothing throughout the film. Captain Boomerang threw 2 Boomerangs throughout the film, there's one scene where Rick Flag destroys the bomb trigger which allowed Captain Boomerang to run off, moments later to return 2 minutes later (Pointless). Killer Croc choke slam a creature and swam underwater. Slipknot didn't even get a backstory, was introduce and died 5 minutes later. I expected more from Katana, all she had was slow motion sword slicing. Deadshot did everything. And finally Diablo, they tried too hard to make his backstory sad and when he died, I didn't even care. What makes me dislike this film is the last 20 minutes. You expect swarms of those creatures defending Enchantress and the machine right? Not one single creature was there to protect her or the machine, In fact the squad just walked in. Diablo fights Enchantress brother for a while and what does the squad do? They could of stopped Enchantress or Deadshot could of shot her heart out but instead they stood there and watched Diablo die. Once the brother was defeated, Enchantress blinks around fighting everyone, she could easily killed everyone but didn't for some reason. Once she threw all their weapons on the floor and gave mercy to them. Harley Quinn accepts mercy and kneels before her only to pick up Katana's blade to cut her heart out making Enchantress powerless (Cheap). Killer croc throws a bomb into the machine for Deadshot too shoot it. That's how they defeat Enchantress and guess what? Everyone stood still and watched Deadshot do all the work.Inconclusive I praise the acting, everyone pulled their weight but the story and the action scene were mediocre. I preferred Batman v Superman and I hated that film. 6/10",Suicide Squad

It's not promising since the trailer was first released and actually I never saw myself watching this again anytime soon. I could say that Cara Delevingne's skill is a bit improving compare to her play as Margo in Paper Towns. What really attract me the most is Margo Robbie's acting.

956,eagleey,All hail Margot Robbie,4,15 August 2016,"I do recommend watching the movie, because it is entertaining, due to the excellent acting of Will SMith and Margot Robbie. Their characters are amazing and it is so worth it to see both of them interact. Both characters do have some depths and it is hard not to enjoy their jokes or Robbie's eccentric acting. In addition to these two, I really liked two other characters. Enchantress and Rick Flag. Their special relationship was a breath of fresh air. Interesting and definitely not boring, compared to all other characters, besides these 4.I was really excited to see Jared Leto as the Joker. But that was a joke. Seriously. No class. No personality. Simply unnecessary. He had way too less time to develop. I personally think, that they should not have added him to this movie. This ruined his whole appearance.Everything else was dull and felt superficial. It did not even entertain. The other characters could have been gone from minute one and you would not have noticed. El Diablo had his moments. But that's it.The story was absolutely forced and felt unnatural. The explanations were illogical. And I mentioned before, that i really like Enchantress. But what do the DC-Guys do? They transform her into an overpowered, in one place mounted sentry, that is able to destroy locations on the other side of the world, but can be beaten into the ground by a fricking baseball bat.I read online, that they cut an incredible amount of scenes. And I guess, that this is the reason, why this movie feels so unfinished and leaves you unsatisfied.",Suicide Squad

958,amai2739,Suicide Squad******,6,27 January 2017,"The third installment into the DCEU, David Ayer's Suicide Squad, I enjoyed it. Of course the movie was far from perfect, but what film is? The story line to me was fairly straight forward, but all the actors brought their A+ game. Margot Robbie killed it as Harley Quinn, I love Margot Robbie's & Jared Leto's dynamic when they share the screen together. What of Jared Leto's Joker? I personally thought he was good, along the line of Mark Hamill's Joker. Elements of Brian Azzerello's & Lee Bermejo's Joker. Did he blow me away like Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight? Unfortunately, he didn't but to me that's due to him not having enough screen time to shine, but that's understandable, considering he's not apart of the Suicide Squad in the comics, only meant to be apart of Harley Quinn's story. Definitely has room to improve though & I love that duo though. Will Smith is Will Smith, he was great as Deadshot. Viola Davis from How to Get Away with Murder plays Amander Waller who's the one responsible for forming Task Force X, she nailed that role to the bone. I think the surprises, wild cards, were Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang, & Jay Hernandez's Diablo, definitely. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc & Karen Fukuhara's Katana to me was cool but only served more as action set pieces. A lot of reviewers said Cara Delevingne didn't shine as Enchantress, I actually kind of liked her role more than expected. The movie was actually a little bit of a tearjerker, had some moments. Overall as I said, I did enjoyed it, it was actually a fun movie.

960,JediMichaelCera,The hate is confusing,8,19 April 2017,"Just to clarify, I do love DC (& Marvel) but I am not one of those brainwashed DC fanboys that just loves anything with the DC brand on it. I found Batman Vs Superman upsettingly bad & after watching that I found my myself questioning many other aspects of Man Of Steel.Anyway, whenever there's a film that's from a long line of stories & characters, franchises etc. & I feel the film isn't a great reflection of the background it was based on, I always ask myself is it a good standalone film? Although Suicide Squad may not have done justice to the comics & stories it was based on, as a film by itself I found it to be enjoyable.There were some really dumb parts to it I admit. Such as Killer Croc & Diablo doing almost nothing throughout the film. Also there were so many opportunities for jokes in the right places. Well executed jokes in films like this help keep them grounded & not cheesy.But the acting was overall good by nearly all the cast. The action was up to standards & the plot......wasn't terrible.The soundtrack was lacking, there's no denying anything there & I feel indifferent to Leto's Joker. Although I feel that tattoos aren't something the Joker would get, somewhat interfering with the whole absolutely nameless & origin-less ideology of the Joker, it's still an interesting take on the character. I also feel his concern for Harley was very misplaced. The Joker usually only ever sees Harley as an object. But we don't know how long they've been together or what exactly they've been through together at this stage so again, there could be some reasoning behind it.I don't think his film deserves anywhere near all the hate it gets but I do understand why people would not like it. There are countless absolutely awful films out there that I see people trying to justify & they just come off as mad most of the time.I enjoyed it as just a bit of fun.

The movie helped build up the story giving each of the major characters a build up. It did feel like a little bit of 'Ghostbuster' but only fleetingly so.Critics may have panned the movie, but I enjoyed it. Lots of color, good CGI, did not feel fake. The sound effects were very good. The language and script, screenplay were alright for this sort of genre. Plenty of light direct humor, nothing too cerebral. Plenty of trippy and whacky badass characters to satisfy even the folks who wish for balance and gender diversity. A few parts did seem puzzling, but you can enjoy the movie nonetheless.",Suicide Squad
968,sionnach-liath,DC trying to go too fast for big team blockbusters,6,11 August 2016,I am a big fan of DC Comics so I am familiar with some of the characters. I found this story was too muddled. The premise for the main action was not great. Lots of goofs in terms of what the characters can do physically. It is not possible to parachute in several characters and then have a big slug-fest and expect your audience to sympathise with each character.Build the characters as part of the story. Show what they can do and why they are as they are as you go. Then go on to have the confrontation. DC need to build a proper story arc. They need to lay off having every villain seem to be a mad scientist or thwarted Demigod.,Suicide Squad
969,yellowgixxer750,"Amusing in parts, but so many missed opportunities...",4,5 August 2016,"Saw this at a preview last night. If I'd paid to see it I would probably have been more disappointed than I was.Let's get the good bits out of the way.Jared Leto as Joker. He's not Heath Ledger, but he didn't play the part like Heath Ledger did. He was...different. And quite disturbingly so. Yeah, he did alright.Margot Robbie. Her character was just about the only one with any back story whatsoever, and consequently (aside from her being gorgeous and having the best lines) she was the only character about whom I cared.Spoiler: Diablo. Great character, some back story, some actual depth (even if he was a walking cliché). But he's not going to be in the inevitable sequel, unless he has some other special power we don't know about. And how the hell did he suddenly become what he did at the end?Deadshot. Jesus, Mr Smith. Are you that skint that you have to take whatever is offered, and that arrogant that you then just phone your performance in? You were out-acted by a headless corpse hanging from a climbing rig. The rest of the characters, including the main not-really-good-woman and the main not- really-bad-villain were utterly two dimensional. Y'know, like they were drawn in a comic.This could have been a great movie. It had a great cast and a really good premise. But DC really need to watch a few Marvel films and learn how it's done...",Suicide Squad
970,ayushimittalstudent,Only for Entertainment purposes,8,28 March 2021,"Loved the graphics and the acting of each individual in this movie especially Joker and Harley Quinn made had a very exotic appearance in this movie.Good to watch on a weekend with friends.I think the movie can have been slightly better, I didn't like the rapidly changing of plots. The story could've had more smoothness and interconnection between the plots.However, it involves some severe scenes and dialogues like Harley Quinn going crazy in love, the fire guy being over agressive and the U. S government being selfish etc which looks amazing on the screen but not in real life.Hence watch it just as Entertainment. Nothing can be implemented in the life.Though you can definitely observe that if there's team work, there's a mix of skills and so anything can be achieved with ease. Also that you must not lose your current loved ones because of beloved lost in the past.You won't be disappointed with the movie, that's guaranteed.",Suicide Squad

Now, I re-watched this recently with my fiancé because she had never seen it and I wondered if it is as bad as people have said it is. Wow, I was amazed at how truly awful the editing, acting, writing, and CGI was. I mean I couldn't believe that I had at one point missed all of these blatant flaws, it completely took me out of the movie and made it impossible to enjoy any moments. Just watch it for yourself, the plot makes less than no sense, an AI could generate a better script for a superhero movie. My fiancé was mad that I made her watch it, but at least we got to laugh at a lot of the strange decisions and cringe inducing writing. I will never watch this again, yikes.",Suicide Squad

976,ostergaardof4,Critics need to loosen up: We live in a mad world.,7,28 September 2016,"Let's call this ""Squad 1."" 1. ""SS"" is too Nazi 2. ""Suicide"" is too Emo 3. ""Squad"" is representative of the movie's theme. 4. ""Skwad"" is too much an in-joke for nerds to be fairly used in a regular review. 5. ""1"" is in anticipation that the DC comics extended universe demands sequels (and reddit rumors back that up)So, Squad 1 evokes too many things in my little heart and brain to contain in one opinionated recap, so this is a short/sweet overview, and then, as they flesh out, I'll post topic-specific reviews.Professional reviewers hate it, but the box office speaks for itself -- either nerds are now mainstream, or the main stream is getting nerdier. Squad 1 is enough of a success there will surely be more of them regardless of critical opinion. Full Disclosure: My opinion is very biased: My wedding registry was full of Suicide Squad and Harley Quinn comics. Even still, I understand a lot of what the professional movie viewers are saying: Squad 1 was not the greatest movie. Story and character motivation ranged from the extreme cliché to unbelievable. While the pacing is pretty smooth, it easily could have been tighter. The plot doesn't have many holes, but it doesn't make the most sense either – that is, If you believe Enchantress and her brother are so powerful, Harley and Deadshot's tricks and grenades shouldn't have worked on her. Most of the skew-iffy stuff could have easily been fixed with simple one-liners here and there, honing the viewer's experience. I expect better from Considering how much money and talent went into this, there's not a good excuse. At best, David Ayer and his 10 Producers were negligent in writing & planning; at worst, they just don't have a grip on how to direct a comic book movie.On the other hand, critics expecting a soulful drama are dumb. Just because Ayer also wrote and directed Fury, Sabotage, and End of Watch, does not mean Squad 1 was going to explore PTSD or alcoholism. That's like saying Kenneth Branaugh's Thor should have had the weight of Hamlet. DUMB. I'm looking at you Variety's Peter Debruge. It's an ensemble action hero movie about villains....by design it's unpredictable. But, I get it -- even by action movie standards, this was kind of a directorial mess. Phenomenal trailers kept all of us rapt the past year. Nerds and critics alike, all bought into these glittering action-trains portraying a full-fledged world, a tongue-in-cheek spray paint darkness, and story-telling without plot-spoiling. These were things of editing beauty. More than quick shots crammed together, they were rhythmically choreographed, and so well executed that the heart of the story was injected right into our eyeballs. So, we were suckered into thinking Squad 1 would be great, not just an action movie with colorful characters, but a thing of creative grace and savage beauty.This built up two expectations: 1) the execution would be amazing, and 2) there would be a lot of Joker. This first was quickly destroyed by the reasons detailed above, but the second is interesting. The trailers and production rumors make Joker out to be the main baddie, and he ain't. Thus, many viewers were butt hurt. That is good work on the park of Ayer and his 10 producers. Even without it being a soulful drama (seriously, Debruge, wtf) or as greased-leather-slick as Deadpool, we're all hooked on the potential of Squads 2, 3, and 4 that Ayer -- or whomever -- can go as low-budget and gritty or as high-SFX and glossy as they like -- and we will go see it.Another point reviewers agree upon is an abundance of sexism and racism. Which may be just as dumb. This ensemble cast is an American diversity wet dream. Half the cast are women. Half the cast is not white. We have leading black, latino, & Asian squad members, plus an host of extras of both dot and feather indians, black, Asian, and latino faces. There is some over-camera-devotion to Margot Robbie's ass (I only found three instances of this) but the comics play up Harley's butt a whole lot so I vote ""appropriate to character."" If you disagree, you can do some readin' (you won't regret it!)Beyond all that, Squad 1 is pretty normal What sets this movie apart, stylistically, is the art direction. Brandt Gordon's day-glo palace of gore drenches every minute of digital media with visual joy. From color palette to backdrop to visual details on every character and wall -- this art direction is out of this world. Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson called it ""ugly."" If you were color blind and live in a Manhattan Ivory Tower, then I empathize, and hope Harley beats you to death in the next movie. What interests me is that Squad 1 exists at all. Our real world is portrayed by TV and internet news outlets as relentlessly dark -- a patch-work of terror and Corrupt Billionaires Running For President. Unfortunately, I guess art imitates life since we've just be swallowing Zack Snyder's unflinchingly morose Batman saga. It's no wonder that eventually audiences grow attuned to this darker aesthetic. Further, the DCU started revolving and the Haves and the Have Nots in the Dark Knight Returns. When I watched Bane cut off the island of Manhattan, I rooted for him. He and Talia were onto something like Fight Club -- not just ""damn the man,"" but a plan of how to damn the man. There's a lotta sympathy for that in our post-Occupy Wallstreet era. The characters in Squad 1 are all damned by the man, and it's easy to feel a lot of sympathy for them even though we know they're villains. We are an audience who ""need them bad."" And that's why Suicide Squad is awesome.",Suicide Squad
977,baileykerr,I'd give it a C,7,18 August 2016,"There is a house (or asylum) in New Orleans where some of the most notorious DC Comic villains reside. They call it Arkham Asylum. Maybe you're familiar with it. The film opens with a glimpse into the daily lives of imprisonment for the most marketable members of the cast, Deadshot played by Will Smith and Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie. Deadshot stands in his cell undoubtedly wondering where he went wrong with his life while Harley Quinn begins her descent into constant flirtatious death threats. These are two of the members of the Suicide Squad who the movie chooses to focus on the most; while I thought they had interesting backstories, I wish that the rest of the squad had gotten expanded instead of compacted.Suicide Squad is under the impression that this is a story-driven movie. But when the characters are cut down to make room so that a complicated, unexplained plot can commence, it leaves a comics-ignorant viewer (such as myself) pleading ever-so-slightly to care about what happens to the characters. I cannot speak for the viewers who attended this movie as DC comics fans, but I heard some laughter in the audience of the screening I attended so maybe this film plays out like an inside joke I wasn't in on.After we get our introduction to Will Smith and Margot Robbie, the plot commences when Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, also known for her work in Doubt and The Help) meets up with who I'm assuming are government officials to tell them about the other members of the Suicide Squad. Davis speaks about how Superman's death is a tragedy of unpredictable proportions. Not only does his loss leave a hole in the heart of the good people of Metropolis, but this means that the next Superman could be the ultimate weapon. As one military official puts it, ""if Superman had decided to fly down, rip off the roof of the White House, and grab the president right out of the Oval Office, who would have stopped him?"". Could this kind of behavior be the product of the next Superman's ideals? Our main characters aren't sure, but they know they need to take precautions against that now. ""This is World War Three"" as Amanda Waller puts it. So who better to call than our main anti-heroes? Probably Batman since he is responsible for rounding half of them up and he competed against Superman in Batman vs. Superman. Or maybe Wonder Woman because she is Superman's female equivalent. Or Aquaman even if he is useless on land. But this isn't a movie about them, this is a movie about the some of the most powerful villains in the DC Comic Universe. That is who the audience paid to see.And for a film made specifically to center around these delightfully devious people (or in one case, creature), I surprisingly did not learn a great deal about them. We saw how Deadshot and Harley Quinn fought and interacted with everyone else, we got brief backstories on each of the others, and we even got the Enchantress who became a villain because of Amanda Waller's task at hand to get the Suicide Squad together. There were fights and plot-points galore, but why would I care about these ultimately confusing plot-points that hop out of nowhere when I have great characters who I'm dying to know more about? I'm not asking for Christopher Nolan type exposition, but more than I received.Let me put it this way. Of the year 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy was one of my favorite movies. Why? Because the story was everyone wants a purple orb and it's up to our heroes to make sure that none of the villains obtain it. This simple plot line enabled the movie to focus on Peter Quill and Gamora's lost childhoods, Rocket's sense of humor and sadness that he is not entirely connected to any species, Drax's inability to pick up on metaphors, and even Groot's optimism and willingness to help. Suicide Squad briefly focused on the main characters but then hurried in an unnecessarily all-over-the-place story. One of the characters became a villain trying to destroy the world, Rick Flagg was ordered to keep secrets from the squad for unknown reasons, the impending ""World War Three"" was never explained but was the main point propelling the movie, a subplot about having to save Amanda Waller and her crew, and a subplot about the Joker trying to break Harley out of the prison.Now, does any of what I said above mean that the film was bad? Not at all. I loved watching the characters and learning what I could about them, the visuals were the right amount of DC universe-dark, the fight sequences were decent, the soundtrack was perfect, and it even gave us Jared Leto as the Joker who, in my humble and nonofficial opinion, gave a better, more unsettling performance than Heath Ledger did. I'm glad I saw this film and believe it deserves a 75% score. All I can say is I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel.PS: Rotten Tomatoes? I want to ask you something personally. You gave a genuinely entertaining film like Suicide Squad a 26% score, yet gave Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates 38%? Is someone paying your critics to dislike DC Comic movies? Or were you drunk while watching Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates and therefore much more forgiving? I don't get you sometimes For more reviews like this, please see my blog, Art Scene State at the following link: http://cinemasmarts.blogspot.com/",Suicide Squad
978,irishmonster,"I really wanted to love this film, but..8",6,7 August 2016,"It's only OK. The story is somewhat boring and contrived, and there are more than a few plot holes. Margo Robbie is pretty good as Harley Quinn, and Viola Davis is very good as Amanda Waller. Will Smith was pretty much what I expected, which was basically every character he has ever played, but without the hair. The other characters are never fully explored, although the first 40 minutes of the movie is spent introducing some of them. I have to say that the biggest disappointment for me was Jared Leto's Joker. I tried to go into the movie with an open mind about his look (which, when it was first revealed, I did not like), and I liked it even less after seeing the movie. His take on the character's criminal insanity is good, but I couldn't get past the ridiculous grill and tattoos. Overall, the movie fell flat on story and character development, was only OK on visual effects and character appearance (Killer Croc and Enchantress looked awesome), but was saved by the performances of Robbie and Davis.",Suicide Squad

980,martinejohanna,worth an IMAX 3D visit,8,6 August 2016,"Plus: Good solid build up, nice main character introductions. Margot Robbie almost carries the film with her brilliant acting, making you wish there will be a Joker/Harley Quinn spin-off. The action doesn't become boring as in many other super hero flicks. Great styling, sets and casting. Some nice jokes. A nice attempt to try and get sympathy for the villains setting some kind of moral complexity, but it doesn't come off very strong. Minus: Of course the movie is full of cliche's and false sentiments, Will Smith get's way too much screen time as a less interesting character claiming the moral high ground, compared to Jared Leto as the Joker, who gets way to little screen time. Cara Delevinge is a horrid casting choice for the role of a professor, her acting is weak, she's way too young and unconvincing as the witch. The whole is pretty predictable, but will leave most Marvel fans happy to have seen it.",Suicide Squad
981,Melissa_Antoinette_Garza,suicide squad (2016) – movie review – the wait is over,10,10 August 2016,"I've waited so long for this movie. I actually bought tickets on 7/18 to make sure I could see it on 8/4 in IMAX.I have adored The Joker, in all of his incarnations since I can remember. He's probably my favorite character of all time. I fully admit that I went to see this for The Joker and Harley Quinn's romance. For that alone, it was well worth it. Still, it had a lot more going for it.The film begins when Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles the worst psychotics to take on any non-human threat.One villain, The Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) is a witch unleashed by archaeologist, June Moone. Amanda keeps The Enchantress's heart, which gives her control, until The Enchantress brings her brother back and they begin to take over by turning people into creatures who work for them. We're introduced to most members via backstories. Deadshot (Will Smith) isn't really too bad of a guy. He's a hit-man, who loves his daughter and is captured by Batman because of that love.I adore Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).I would have watched her backstory with The Joker (Jared Leto) for hours. She, of course,starts as Dr. Harleen Quinzel and The Joker is her patient. She falls for him and even brings him a stuffed animal kitty. He asks her for a small favor. All he wants in the whole world is a machine gun. How could anyone deny him that? So, she like anybody with a heart would,gets him one. He breaks out and gives Quinzel a bit of shock. Later above a vat of chemicals that turned him into the sexy beast he is. She willingly jumps into the vat wanting to be his. The Joker starts to walk away. He's angry at himself for caring about her, but jumps nonetheless. I love them together.As the King of Gotham, if an idiot disrespects his Queen, The Joker obviously has no choice but to kill. He, after all, is still The Joker.He's a sexy, David Bowie/Alice Cooper gorgeous killer who needs his own film with Harley.You can keep THE NOTEBOOK and TITANIC. The Joker and Harley ALWAYS does it for me and the casting here was topnotch.Due to Batman's reckless behavior of jumping on his car, The Joker drives into water and narrowly escapes with his life. Harley is then put in jail.Of course, The Joker isn't going to leave his lady love in prison. He gets a guard to sneak her a phone and texts that he's coming for her.Some are upset that the movie didn't make a love triangle between Deadshot, Harley and The Joker. I'm SO glad they didn't. It isn't only Harley's strength that The Joker likes. It's Harley's complete infatuation and loyalty to him. He created her. They're meant for each other as if her were Adam and she Eve. It's her willingness to throw away her career,jump into a vat and be reborn into Harley that makes him take her.It's her complete and sworn devotion to him that not only he enjoys, but the audience enjoys too. The Joker and Harley are perfect together as is. They should be a duo that rules Gotham together. I'd love them to kill Batman and take over. It's like NATURAL BORN KILLERS and BONNIE & CLYDE, but sexy.By the way, how is there not a Harley & Joker comic? Why isn't there one? MAD LOVE is my favorite. I love the backstory between them. Why aren't they ever allowed a universe where they can create mayhem,screw over Batman and get away with it.I would love to see Harley in a position to continuously save The Joker and vice versa.Now, there were other characters too. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is a bad-ass. He lives in water and has the exterior of a Croc. He's strong and doesn't mess around. He was pretty funny and also an intimidating dude.Diablo (Jay Hernandez) is a guy who when pushed to the edge can start fires with his hands. He doesn't like doing it because years ago, he got angry and set a fire that killed everyone in his house.Boomerang (Jai Courtney) is a huge tough guy who loves fighting and throwing his boomerang. He's witty and funny. He definitely has a few shining moments. I wouldn't mind seeing a movie about his character.Amanda puts Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman) in charge. He's a soldier who has fallen in love with June Moone and wants to save her from The Enchantress. On his side is Katana (Karen Fukuhara) a woman who traps the souls of her victims in the same sword her husband's soul is trapped in.This was definitely non-stop action. The film was smart enough to divide the time that the Joker was on screen so you never went longer than about 10-15 minutes without seeing him. Jared Leto shines. I knew he would. Ever since I saw the first picture released where everyone was upset about the tattoos, I was like, ""Yep, there's the Joker.""Leto is different than any Joker we have seen in the past. I thought I'd be the only one rooting for him, but I wasn't. Most of the crowd, at the theater, loved him. He's maniacal, crazy and so much cooler than Batman.Many fans of The Joker have stated on message boards that he needed to be in the film more. I can't deny that, but then again it could have been a 12 hour long one-man-show of The Joker and I'd say, ""we need a bit more Joker.""Overall, see this in IMAX. I know I'll see it a few more times before it comes to Blu-ray and then I'll buy the Blu-ray.Kudos all around. Everyone did a really great job.",Suicide Squad
982,IAmMrDexB,"Not enough comedy, not enough action, plenty of sappy scenes.",2,17 August 2016,"Oh god! What a total mess. Excuse me if I'm a comic book expert but my boyfriend is, and he noticed way more flaws I have although I've noticed just as many. The editing was a mess. I kept reading that quote over and over in other people's reviews and it's messy enough for me to compare to Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.But it's not just the editing. The film is a rubbish tip. The plot, the number of characters and the amount of time given to those characters. Feels like basically everything. Not even Will Smith's Deadshot or Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn gets enough screen time, with not much acknowledgement at all for Jared Leto's Joker, who I felt was a mishmosh of all of the past Jokers, Heath Ledger being the (way too) closest to influencing Jared. Shame. But the main issue is that with no proper back stories, they just throw in a lot of these characters and even then, we don't see enough comedy, we don't see enough action, instead most of the time the film is sappy. Even a Batman Begins reference is included. Sappier than The Notorious Bettie Page.The finale and the villains' villains are lacklustre. Mind you they would have been better as the ghosts of Ghostbusters. I believed it might have been the ghosts that the Ghostbusters would actually catch. The villain are easy to kill anyway and I could easily photoshop this finale for the Ghostbusters to be in Suicide Squad's place. Would have been higher than the 3 1/2 stars that I gave it. All it needs now is more actual jokes like Mike and Dave Needs Wedding Dates does, a proper script like any 80s comedy and the original Ghostbusters.This review might as uneven as the film itself, but the last target I want to attack is: the music!!! Queen!!! Suicide Squad trailer!!! That was fantastic. What we did get? Gun scene??? Kanye West??? AGAIN!?! Nope. This soundtrack feels like the 2010s version of Blue Brothers 2000. You know. Random scenes happen then people stay singing. Not quite the same with this but with the random songs and Bohemian Rhapsody saved for the end, I'm still very disappointed.The few good things: Even with Margot Robbie's Harley, her lines aren't perfect. We need more fecking comedian-writers if you want to beat Deadpool or even Tank Girl. Dare I say Lori Petty's current project OINTB? If that does ever happen, Mr Warner, I would want a spin-off of Harley Quinn, with proper back story, good justice and the most familiar character traits. My boyfriend disagrees with the fact that she is forced to eat in the prison. But I agree with Killer Croc that he is beautiful. EVERYBODY IS BEAUTIFUL! Mais encore, le film est un désordre total.And another thing, well, it's more like a wish. But thanks to Mike and Jay from RedLetterMedia as per usual for pointing out things I haven't noticed before, in order to write this update. They've done a update coincidentally. But indeed, the first ten minutes is basically a whole other film. I could easily enjoy whole flashbacks, even in a separate film. So I conclude that this film can't just be fixed by a Director's Cut, there will need to be a Part 1 and Part 2. And while you're at it, remove those disgraceful, random uses of pop songs.You know, Little Shop of Horrors wasn't always rated 5/5, especially before the Director's Cut came in.",Suicide Squad
983,hidariryuI,Don't let the critics fool you,8,5 August 2016,"So I went to see Suicide Squad yesterday. Let me start by saying that DC has taken a step in the right direction. What they have started to do is make the continuity of their movies work so that every movie is starting to tie in. Much like everyone in the past few weeks with the release of the Batman V Superman: DOJ I watched the movie again. I still have no love for Zack Snyder. It is apparent that he has an intense dislike for Superman and that he has a darkly smudge soul so he has no happiness but it is glaringly apparent that he has some kind of direction. He just needs to get the proper coordination. Moving past that David Ayer, who is a fantastic director has a very dark and funny look on life and his take on the Suicide Squad is a refreshingly view at what makes a bad guy. Is it what they do or is it what they are? The answer may surprise you. The movie tries in ways to be fun and other times darkly serious. If you are looking for a Marvel funfest of bright colors and showy fights then you are in the wrong movie. It is dark and scary. Gruesome and gritty. I wouldn't let a kid see this because it is exactly what you would expect a movie about villains doing villain things to be like.Positives: 99% percent of the featured cast. Stand outs were Will Smith, Viola Davis, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. The action scenes were dynamite and the cameos by the 2 heroes were perfectly shaped into the plot. The dynamic of the Joel Kinneman and Will Smith was very interesting to see. Viola Davis captured the essence of Amanda Waller. My wife thought that Margot Robbie's turn as Harley Quinn was not a stretch for her because she can't be that cute and not be crazy. (Arleen Sorkin should be proud of her). Jai Courtney made me like Captain Boomerang and not think of him as a cheesy villain that fights the Flash.Negatives: Katanna seemed to be a forced character in the movie. The story lost a little pace and the marketing department used too many of the great scenes as trailer bait so there was a lot of spoilers due to the trailers. Overall as a comic book fancier, I give it a 8 out of 10. The DC universe will have to bring everything back together in the upcoming years to correct the missteps that they have started to make up for it.",Suicide Squad
984,micahmatt-fcb,All that hype for such little delivery,2,15 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was advertised as being the next big DC film. Unfortunately, it wasn't good. The editing was jarring, the music choices were inappropriate for the scenes (and it also was just playing back some of the most overplayed classic rock songs you hear every day on the radio), the acting was poor aside from Margot Robbie, and really the whole picture just felt like it was shot on a studio lot as a low budget movie. Unfortunately, the film falls flat in every area. Batman gets about 1 minute of screen time and Joker gets maybe 5. The trailers really misrepresented what the film was going to be and leaves you wishing you had spent your money on something else. For those who didn't like Batman vs. Superman, this movie is far worse. It's down there next to ""Batman and Robin""... you know, the one with Mr. Freeze and all the horrible puns?",Suicide Squad

And yess i read DC and Marvel and every other comic that is out there...and trust me this movie has nothing to do with comics except te characters. It is simply as the critics say a terrible movie....i watch the movie til the moment they went in the bar to have a drink and have a thee time!!! I tought i need a drink myself and walked out of the cinema...again this movie is terrible even for comics en dc fans!!the characters were not funny at all there wasnot even one moment in the movie that i tought this is the turning point it was like watching a bad edited movie..done by a high school kids who did his final exam in film making and use the standard bad/good guy formula and dc owed him something like 175 mil dollar,Suicide Squad
987,rawadk,Disappointing... but good,7,4 August 2016,"Considering all the hype and trailers that we have been seeing for months, I left the movie a little bit disappointed. I expected this movie to be a major upgrade from Batman vs Superman, but it wasn't. But it wasn't THAT bad, it was a decent story line with some great superheroes.The portrayal of most of the superheroes was one of the things that made me enjoy the movie and forget some of the bad things such as the awful Jared Leto as the Joker. I enjoyed Will Smith as Deadshot who was like the leader of the group. He eventually accepted that he is one of the good guys and should help the army. In turn, he would also persuade the others. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was great. Crazy but great. Her dysfunctional relationship with the Joker makes her even more crazy and mad. Jay Hernandez as El Diablo was a character that, at first is afraid of his own powers, but later gains courage to fight.Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker was awful. With Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson, The Joker was the bad guy that everybody loves. With Jared Leto, he destroyed that. His style and the iconic Joker laugh were terrible.Enchantress was good but I thought her character could have been portrayed better. Her background story should have explained and should have been given more screen time. She seemed like a real villain and one that could challenge the Suicide Squad; unlike the Joker.Overall, I found the movie to be entertaining. Most of the superheroes are interesting, each with their own background. There were some good jokes in the movie and the post-credits scene made me eagerly waiting the next movie. But this isn't a movie at the same level of The Dark Knight, so hopefully, the future DC comics movies will be much better.",Suicide Squad
988,mickelmoney,3hrs Would Have Done This Story Justice,6,22 November 2020,"Suicide Squad is a highly underrated movie that tells the story of a group of criminals known as ""meta humans"" who are given an option of a reduced sentence (and their life) if they choose to help fight for the united states in the foreign affairs. The only problem is that these foreign affairs are not of human decent. In a world that now has no Superman a group of powerful people must form to help defend the planet.In my own opinion, people don't like this movie because of its comedic relief and since of ""cheese"", I think a movie like this is great because it stands out in the rest of the DC Universe, a universe that is becoming more and more dark. A movie with ALOT of interesting story lines and a new view at some familiar faces is refreshing.One note that I think could have made this movie better was to simply make it longer, this could have easily been a three hour movie. This would have allowed for a much deeper character development that didn't really exist in this movie. So many great stories rest behind these ""heroes"" that could all have their own movie, a little bit more time invested into their background I believe would have done DC well.",Suicide Squad
989,farahnoga,Entertaining but not as good as expected,6,11 August 2016,"I was looking forward to watch suicide squad. I love DC comics but I'm not a huge fan of their cinematic universe. Suicide squad looked different than the previous dceu movies and that was the main reason for my excitement.I loved the characters in the movie. Margot Robbie did a great job, she sounded exactly like Harley Quinn from batman: the animated series. She was childish and lovable yet really insane.I was kind of worried when they announced that Will Smith was going to play Deadshot, I felt like he doesn't fit the role but I'm glad I was proved wrong. I loved every scene his character was in and I also loved his back story.I wasn't a huge fan of El diablo, Rick Flag and Boomerang before the movie but I absolutely loved them after it especially Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, I loved the romance between him and Enchantress' alter ego, June moon.The character that disappointed me was the Joker. I know that Jared Leto is a good actor and I know that he had so much to give to the role but he doesn't appear that much, most of his scenes in the trailers were cut out from the movie which made him an unnecessary character. I don't blame Leto for this, it's absolutely a wrong decision made by the director. I was expecting to see Harleen Quinzel becoming Harley Quinn but instead we got a one minute scene explaining her back story.The editing in my opinion was really bad, the action sequences were messy and hard to keep up with. The third act was weak and the same goes to the villain.Overall, suicide squad is another generic comic book movie but it was very entertaining. I didn't feel bored while watching it. I loved the humor and the characters. Compared to other huge let downs this summer, suicide squad was a decent movie. I expected something better but that didn't prevent the movie from being enjoyable.7/10",Suicide Squad
990,cifers,Just make a Batman movie with Joker & Harley!,2,6 September 2016,"Spoiler free review:I'm a huge fan of comic books, so I know the characters from the source material. Normally it's easy for me to say if I like or dislike a comic book movie. In this case, I do both:PRO: I absolutely love the new Joker and Harley Quinn!! Jared Leto and Margot Robbie are stunning, their performances are incredible and they absolutely own all scenes they appear in. Leto had very big shoes to fill after Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger, but his Joker is very different and perfect in his own unique way. Robbie as Harley is also perfect, she really nails the character, this is exactly how Harley is supposed to be. Also praise to the designers who reinvented Joker for this movie.CONTRA: 1.) This movie is like a meal with ingredients which doesn't belong together, like ice cream on pizza. On one hand we have Joker, Harley, Deadshot, etc. who have no superpowers, realistic characters. On the other side we have a crazy ""The world is in danger"" plot with supernatural elements and characters with god-like powers. It just doesn't fit together. 2.) The movie wastes Harley and especially Joker. Harley's origin was too rushed and they cut too many Joker scenes out. I understand why Jared Leto is frustrated about this. Joker's relationship to Harley is supposed to be abusive, here it's too romantic. 3.) This movie should be R-Rated!!! It's PG-13, because of the greed of the studio bosses.4.) These are supposed to be criminals, psychopaths, bad guys. No anti-heroes. With the marketing line ""Worst heroes ever"" I already feared they make them to anti-heroes and especially Deadshot is just too nice. And why has Deadshot almost never his mask on?? Oh right, because it's Will Smith, superstars don't want to wear masks, so everyone can see their famous face (sarcasm!). Then leave the movie, for god's sake! That's not really Deadshot, that's Will Smith. 5.) Some characters deserved better, like Enchantress and Captain Boomerang. The actors did a great job, but screenplay could have been better for them. Rick Flag and Amanda Waller are just boring leaders, especially Waller.CONCLUSION: Just make a Batman movie with Leto's Joker and Robbie's Harley, the only perfect aspects of this movie. Don't waste them for a cheesy supernatural plot. I give Joker & Harley a 10/10, the rest of the movie a 4/10.",Suicide Squad
991,amirjonis,Don't bother -- it's a mess.,3,5 August 2016,"Flat jokes, one-liners and terrible chemistry make up this movie. As usual, we see a group of heroes taking on a legion of mindless alien/zombie/no-named soldiers who have absolutely no chance. There are so many awkward moments in this movie. You don't have to see the movie to know how it will play out and end. The bad guy is lame and uninteresting, who apparently has the power to instantly disarm all of the heroes but doesn't use it until the very end -- when it's too late. I get that they want to show us that she is ""powerful"", but they just don't know what they are doing. Just terrible.Save your time and money. There are few memorable things about this movie.",Suicide Squad
992,filmicsite,"Suicide Squad | Worst Heroes Ever with great potential, but wrong execution",7,5 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is an all out entertainer, a movie filled with fun. But if you take it more seriously and go in riding the hype, you are going to be disappointed. Go in with low expectation and you will have the greatest and most entertaining movie experience of this summer.So Let us dissect the review and let me tell you why the worst heroes ever are not a part of worst movie ever that many people seem to be saying.First of all, Suicide Squad is about a group of criminals banded together by Amanda Waller played by (Viola Davis), and the team of villains involves Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney ), Diablo (Jay Hernandez ), Killer Croc, Captain Flag and Enchantress (Carla Delvigne). And joining them is Jared Leto as Joker.The thing that we need to remember is that there are hell lot of characters involved in Suicide Squad and most of them have never been seen on Movie Screen across the world. So every character needs an introduction which makes the first 40 minutes of the movie as just introduction to various characters as their name is shown in fancy colors with Flashbacks covering the introduction. Now this marks up the theme of the movie and the movie never loses that theme. Its clear that the director wants you to know that the movie is not taking itself seriously.This lead to another complication, the lack of time leads to lack of good base to form characters on, and without a good base, a character can not stand. This is what happens with most of the members of Suicide Squad, they are forgotten after a few scenes and are added just for a few gags in every few minutes or so. This soon becomes a little annoying and boring. The Director David Ayer flourishes the character of Deadshot and Harley Quinn, but in the process leaves behind others, especially Boomerang.The Good : Moving on to the good parts of Suicide Squad : Jared leto as Joker : Jared Leto did his completely original Joker in Suicide Squad, He takes the fun of Jack Nicholson's Joker and the insanity of Ledger's iconic performance and multiplies them together to form this highly insane and utterly charming antagonist. The movie has very less Joker, but the amount of screen time he gets, he makes it worth it. I cannot wait where his character leads to and would love for him to get a much broader open role.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn : Harley Quinn is Joker's Queen, she will do anything for Joker. She will die and even live for him. Once the psychiatrist of Joker, she fell in love with Joker and left everything for him. Margot Robbie not only is gorgeous and her seductive remarks brilliant she is completely unpredictable as Harley Quinn, just like herself in Comics.This bring me to another great thing in this movie, The chemistry between Joker and Harley, they are born to be together. The queen to the joker as they are made to go together in a game of Solitaire. The genuine obsessive love is drawn out by both actors brilliantly and kudos to director for creating that chemistry in between all the actors in the movie.Will Smith plays Himself, he fits right in as our lead actor he is brilliant, he has more back story which solidifies his character even more than others. He has his humanity with him, and a loving father to her daughter. The interesting bit is the sort of 'father-daughter' kind of relationship that Deadshot and Quinn has, they understand each other more than anyone else. The bad Let's see, Joker is not even in 30 minutes of the movie, that makes the best thing in the movie also a the bad thing . The overly sexualised Harley Quinn does not go well with the flow, especially regarding the PG-13 rating it got.Weak Villain: I won't spoil anything, but the motive of Antagonists to go against 'the world' is a laughable one dimensional plot device. The choppy editing makes it even worse. You can easily see that many scenes are abruptly cut, probably due to the re-shoot they did and the pressure after the failure of Batman v Superman.Bad Camera Work and Direction: Now this is the point that took away all the score of the movie. David Ayer forgets that he is directing a Superhero Flick driven by action, we get a lot of close up and not even a single good enough wide angle shot throughout the movie. Now this is the fatal flaw in his direction and Suicide Squad, he relies too much on few characters which isolates and separate other characters from the movie.What Avengers and Captain America Civil War and Even Zack Snyder's Batman V Superman did was get all the characters which are part of the team inside the frame. In almost every scene in Civil War, more than three characters are together, this gives a momentum and stillness to the story that is hard to achieve. It also solidifies the team. Suicide Squad does not feel like a Squad because of this reason.The excessive use of Shaky cam is another down point in Ayer's Direction. Conclusion 7/10 Fun Summer Blockbuster with few brilliant performances. Full review and other reviews at www . filmicsite .com",Suicide Squad
993,NeoChrys,Looking forward to more Harley and Deadshot!,7,6 August 2016,"Although i don't think the Suicide Squad was as good as BvS, it was still a really fun time and it definitely enriched the DCEU as a whole. I think that in general the positive aspects of the movie made up for the not so positive aspects. Most of the performances were A+++. Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Viola Davis killed it. Jared Leto was fine as Joker and i would like to see more of him but i would prefer it if it was always in connection to Harley Quinn. Not as a main villain. Cara Delevinge's acting was weak and i am glad that her storyline has closed for good (hopefully). The team dynamics were great. I thoroughly enjoyed Harley's and Deadshot's ''blooming friendship''. And i believe they will be the fan favorites since they were the ones who got a solid backstory and got scenes throughout the movie that helped you to feel for them. I would have liked to see more of Katana. She was cool but the movie did not help me understand her motivations. I did not have that many problems with the editing. Only in the beginning during the character introductions, the scenes were not flowing so smoothly the one after the other. But after the team assembled it was okay. It is true that the villain was the main negative aspect of the movie. Cara's acting did not help but i believe that in an introductory movie they should have gone with a smaller scale villain. Little less on the supernatural side and more comprehensible. Otherwise they should have devoted a little more time in who Enchantress is, her backstory and her relationship with Rick (because i was supposed to care about their romance too). I understand ofc that using the Enchantress made for a really impressive final battle scene. I did enjoy that very much. The visuals were fantastic.",Suicide Squad
994,dacksonflux,Boring Cliché,1,10 August 2016,"DC, what have you done? Following the ""Dark Knight"" trilogy this is beyond disappointing. This is just my personal opinion but I am by all means willing to explain why I feel this way.1. No time for character development. A vital moment in every film is when you give the audience reason to care about the main characters, what they do, the decisions they make, and how the characters themselves affect the overall story. The Suicide Squad members did not affect the story. Harley did everything pretty much on her own.2. 0 (zero) chemistry between characters. The body language and dialogue frequently clashed.3. The characters were not as they were hyped up to be. Deadshot and Joker specifically come to mind in this particular problem. Joker is a performer, he's a CLOWN. When Joker was not written to perform for the audience but is instead preoccupied with confusing displays of affection for Harley, you know you have a problem (Joker's not affectionate to begin with). Leto simply was not allowed to be Joker. Deadshot was worse. Will Smith is a phenomenal actor who was thrown into the same screen with mediocre and stiff co-stars who suffered from a bad case of... Both of these supposed major characters with serious hype from media turned out to be rather minor.4. HORRIFIC DIALOGUE Whoever wrote this screenplay needs to be spoken to harshly then fired. The lines were choppy. Situations were understated. Vernacular was outdated and conflicting.5. I don't need to see SAMSUNG pop up on the screen every 15 minutes. Product placement was blatant and crass.6. The whole movie was forced. Nothing felt natural. Gotham city is not a PG-13 city. Gotham is an R rated city with very dark and depressing themes. More than half the cast should never have been introduced. The movie wastes a lot of time rushing their intros and then has too little time in which they rush the plot.7. The plot hardly exists. Enchantress wants to annihilate humanity. Harley stops her. The end. Should take maybe an hour and a half (if you want slow and gradual buildup), but ends up taking two hours. So factor in at least 30 minutes of, ""Hi, my name is ___________ and I won't be doing much. #YOLO"" Dialogue is that bad, yes.8. Did I mention Joker + Social Media? That was painful to sit through. Painful. Fortunately it was quick. We didn't suffer long.9. It wasn't bad enough to be laughed at and it certainly wasn't good enough to be enjoyed. Suicide Squad was boring. I was bored almost to sleep. It's been a while since I fell asleep during a movie at the theater. I did not expect Suicide Squad to do that to me. I stayed awake only because I didn't want my friend to realize it had been a complete waste of time.How this movie could've been saved: 1. Follow the script and don't second guess yourself with multi-million dollar re-shoots. The first trailer was captivating, eerie, and exciting. The final trailer was messy, too exaggerated in all the wrong ways, and cliché.2. Spend that extra couple million on better cast, better editing, and better effects.3. Pick a genre.4. Pick an antagonist.5. Pick a protagonist.6. Plan to have antagonist and protagonist disagree on something.7. Have that something turn into a problem that needs to be fixed.8. Plan to have that problem addressed.9. Pat yourself on the back because you just discovered plot.",Suicide Squad
995,alfiemachin,"Wildly over hyped, nevertheless still an enjoyable movie.",7,13 October 2016,"Being a very big dc fan (in particularly batman), i was immediately excited for this film the moment it was announced at comic con a while back. I was very disappointed to realize jared letos joker played a small part in the film considering he was the center of all the marketing such as trailers and posters etc. But i'm hoping the extended cut will show more of what he has to offer as i believe he has great potential. Deadshot and Harley Quinn played by Will smith and Margot Robbie stole the show in my opinion Their characters showed off their tremendous skill and craziness as well as proving even the worst villains are still very much human. The soundtrack alone for this film was brilliant but did seem quite over the top with a different famous rock song opening almost every chapter. The plot was the average superhero story you would expect but i found the special effects, scenes and actions choreography amazing, especially in imax 3d. This definitely is come back from the boring and tedious batman vs superman but doesn't live up to its ridiculous amount of hype nevertheless it was a very good film to watch and i shall be looking forward to buying the extended cut edition.",Suicide Squad

I knew only one thing for certain going into this movie, and that was that it did have a pretty good soundtrack.The beginning of the movie felt like not really a movie at all; actually, I wasn't quite sure what it felt like, but I kept watching, hoping that it would go somewhere, and again, enjoying the ""good soundtrack"" that was quickly unfolding.Once the actual ""action"" started, I watched attentively, until pausing for a 45 minute nap. I then continued, somewhat less attentive, for the remainder of the movie, somehow missing the final ""victory"", BUT HEY, the soundtrack was GOOD!To hard core DC Comic fans, there may be some production value here, but for me, it fell short of a good movie and left me short nearly the price of a gallon of gas. I would recommend only spending your money on it if you have to, and instead, wait till it comes out on demand, Netflix, etc. If you do decide to watch it, I doubt it will be one you will be starving to watch again- I know I won't be.",Suicide Squad

I liked Harley Quinn and deadshot was ok but other than that the rest of the lineup was just aweful. The plot is one of the dumbest I have seen in a movie in a long time. I can't believe they are making a sequel. How can it get any crappier than the first but guess we will see but I won't cuz I will not waste 2 more hours on this crap.,Suicide Squad
1005,tryniti987,Bad Good Guys? or Good Bad Guys?,7,11 August 2016,"Lets get straight to it! Cons: Film struggled with direction the entire time. Some points they're truly ""bad guys"", other moments they just seem like costume crusaders.Plot was pretty flimsy. They didn't reach any far surfaces of the brain with this story. No plot twist either. The entire movie, as long as it is, just moved way to quickly. Character building was not a thing in this film. This movie had so much potential to have sequels, but you can clearly tell they will have 1-2 spin offs. Characters! 3 out of the entire cast were the main focus. Everybody else was just.....there! (!!!spoiler spoiler!!!) Why even have a character introduced if you were just going to kill them within 5 minutes, was it a role or a cameo?Jared Leto, he can act, but in my personal opinion, he did a horrible job as joker. Out of all the actors who've played Joker i'd rate him the lowest. I just didn't feel like he was evil or insane. I didn't get any sense of fear, from his portrayal. Pros: Acting! Viola Davis as always, is a beast. She knows how to command your attention. Will Smith was at the front of almost every scene. That was both good and bad. Margot Robbie, stole every scene she was in, it was hard not to love her. She portrayed Harley Quinn to the T, down to the voice and mannerisms. Oh! and Jai Courtney, this was probably his best role ever, if he gets more work in Hollywood it'll be because of this movie. I always viewed him as the new Colin Farrell, want to ruin your movie? Hire this dodo! The CGI was too much, but was done very well. Casting! The entire cast worked really well together, nobody seemed like a bad fit, other than Jared Leto.Conclusion: Film had so much potential to be incredibly epic, but in the end I feel fell short. Should have spent more time on Character development, and on the plot. The plot was just so over exaggerated and plain. It was a good film, with good production and a great cast that played there parts really well(minus Leto) but the plot just was so dull and boring. 7/10 DVD Collection must have, but not a favorite",Suicide Squad

Zero character development, zero plot and weak dialog throughout.With no character development, you don't care about who the heroes are.Without a decent plot, you don't care what happens to anyone.Without good dialog, it leaves no impression.This is DC's attempt to get in the game where Marvel dominates. Marvel has taken their time to create stories around each individual character (Iron Man, The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Ant Man, etc....) to develop their background, how they became who they are, and that makes them likable. DC has decided against that route, and threw a bunch of characters together that they barely introduce.By the end, I didn't care who triumphed. All I cared about was that it was over.",Suicide Squad

The first act was executed very well introducing the various characters in a very unique way that gave you a look into their life before their incarceration combined with classic songs that surprisingly fit.Although it started off promising, it simply doesn't juggle the large ensemble properly and the film suffers for it despite the efforts of standouts Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, who's arc is quite honestly one of the best in the film and Deadshot, played by Will Smith, is the closest to an actual protagonist you'll see on screen without actually being referenced as one. Unfortunately,Many of the trivial cast members stumble with finite screen time, secondary prequels and sandwiched benefactions. Jared Leto surprisingly managed to create an incarnation of The Clown Prince that truly stands on his own. It reminds me partly of ""Scarface"". Might not agree with me but I got that impression. Most of his performance was seen through Harley's prequel and I wish he was used more in this film because his portrayal shows promise if given a proper film. If The Joker had been utilized more in this film, he could have added that layer of chaos that the film was sorely lacking. The Joker holds a double edged sword in this film unfortunately. He is the personification of the film's best concepts as well as its worst proclivities. Like Deadshot's story and El Diablo's, Joker's love affair with Harley Quinn is told through flashbacks. The majority of the film's most powerful emotions are encased in flashbacks. One example of a major flaw:The villain's gripe with Humanity is exposed in one single line of dialogue.It's quite ironic that a film that celebrates the protagonists features the worst villain I've ever seen in a comic book movie. There's no denying that factor. The Enchantress along with the other villain I won't mention to those who haven't seen the film could easily be forgotten and mistaken for something out of Gods of Egypt. It was a wasted opportunity to craft a villain that can stand out in a pack of disposable villains we constantly get in the genre. I seriously have to question the concept of the eyes of The Adversary. For those action setups which weren't jaw dropping with the one exception to Deadshot's one scene, I thought every time I seen a minion I was seeing a cross between a Lovecraft concept crossed with some crazy Resident Evil zombie. The concept looks out of place with the film. The film score I felt was great in the first half since many of the songs are truly classics but it felt odd with the second half shifting to a traditional film score. The plot isn't honestly that great. This film had a great opportunity to do things outside the box but it played safe well too safe and by doing so it lost the initial spark that it had in the first act. Plus the haphazard editing didn't help the film. It's reluctantly disappointing that a such visual spectacle was wasted on a ghastly plot, haphazard editing,insipid action and yet again a Lackluster villain in a film coincidentally celebrating villains.",Suicide Squad
1011,ninepee,This film just felt like a chore to watch.,2,30 December 2019,A star each for Margot Robbie and Will Smith's performance. Other than that there's not a lot to like about this film. It just drags along and I really could not wait for the credits to roll.,Suicide Squad
1012,SwishCrane441,Me to critics: Seriously... what the hell is wrong with you people? Critics: We are the bad guys.... its what we do.,6,14 August 2016,"Since the comic-con trailer leak last year, well everybody has been going nuts (no question there) over SS. BvS turned out to be an okay fare and would've stayed that way until that 'Martha thingy' which just ruined all the fun for me.This is a Will Smith movie and boy he is solid as Deadshot! Surprisingly JK's Rick Flagg does a marvelous job as well and both Deadshot/Flagg chemistry is something to look for on-screen.Many say Margot Robbie was born to play Harley. Yup, right! Her love or I'd like to call madness for Mr. J and subsequent descend into crazy is portrayed compellingly. To those complaining ""no screen time for Joker"", to them uhh.. I say ""get a life"" cos The Joker is not integral to the movie plot, he's more here as a treat to the fans and reference to Harley Quinn's story arc. In no way, NO WAY, does JL ever comes close to the Ledger's version (no one can surpass that).. not in this lifetime!! The real show stealer for me was El Diablo. Firstly, he's super cool with his pyro power and secondly he's just.. super cool. Other characters were fab too; Katana (ass-kicker), Croc and Boomerang (not much to do tho).The new hottie Cara Delevigne as Enchantress was a delight. Been on her trail after having watched PAPER TOWNS (don't judge). Overall a complete entertainer, good 3D, action, humor, & soundtrack.Special praise for Viola Davis's character as Amanda Waller -- one cold hearted bitch she turned out to be. David Ayer kudos! DC/WB still a long way to go (8.5/10)",Suicide Squad
1013,newyears1978,Wow.,3,24 November 2016,"This movie is some how worse than Superman v Batman...I think the only thing I enjoyed about this movie was Margie's portrayal of Harley Quinn, and Joker for the brief moment he was in.I found the enchantress to look kinda cool too.The character development is so weak in this game..you will barley know anything about anyone, without having prior knowledge as a fan or something. The open sequence seemed to be ripped right out of other movies like The Rundown or something...but for me made the movie disjointed..The actual plot..not really much to be said about it at all. You know what would be awesome, if the folks that own Marvel just bough DC and started making the DC movies..at least then we would have decent films.",Suicide Squad
1014,jasonblack_123,Never listen to critics before seeing it for yourself,9,8 September 2016,"So, this past Monday night was my first cinema trip in over a year, the past time I went was to see Ted 2 (don't judge me, but I liked it) and I went with the sole purpose of seeing Suicide Squad. I'll keep this review short and sweet and not about the story as it was pretty run-of-the-mill as far as superhero movie stories go:The Joker = Thoroughly and pleasantly surprised by Jared Leto's turn as the Clown Prince of Crime in this film. He more than lived up to Nicholson and Ledger, and in fact, I believe he has created his own version of the character that can be placed alongside the past incarnations on the same platform. While definitely taking inspiration from his predecessors, Leto has truly made the Joker his own and although he was in the film sparingly, I personally found it made me want to see more of him.Harley Quinn = As I expected, she became my favourite character in the film. Sexy, beautiful, crazed, wild, dangerous, and insanely hilarious, Margot Robbie absolutely hit it out of the park for me with her portrayal and even, oddly, somehow portrayed the Joker and Harley's relationship as a genuine, tragic love story which I was both surprised and pleased by.Captain Boomerang = Great character, some funny lines and moments, fantastic character name in my opinion, should have been given more to do, but perhaps in the sequel he will. Oh and it was the first time I haven't been bored by Jai Courtney in a movie so that's a plus in my book.El Diablo = The tragic anti-hero of the story. His character arc in the film was, unfortunately, very predictable, especially when his backstory was revealed and it became obvious he was going to become the ""fall"" guy for the film. Would have liked to have gotten more invested in him.Slipknot = He was in the movie and is on the poster... Good for him.Katana = They typical silent assassin character in a comic book movie and filled her role well. Again, perhaps she'll be given more to do in the sequel.Killer Croc = The make-up job for Croc was INSANE and all mostly practical! Big thumbs up for me! Also loved the homage to Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs when he's wheeled out to be briefed on the mission with a mouth guard. Was awesome in action scenes but would have liked more backstory portrayed. Very good character.June Moon / Enchantress = The villain... Typical comic book movie villain for modern superhero flicks... Cara Delevigne is nice to look at and all but her performance in this leaves a lot to be desired.Rick Flag = Great yin to the rest of the Squad's yang. Very sympathetic and empathetic character who turned out to be an absolute bad-ass.Deadshot = Will Smith... Why is it you always make me feel with your performances?? Damn you can act sir. Honestly did not expect either the character of Deadshot to emotionally get to me or make me care for a character that, admittedly, I knew very little to nothing about before seeing the film. His portrayal of a loving father who has to do very bad things to provide for his daughter was amazing and I have no qualms in saying he was my favourite character on par with Harley.Can't wait to see where they go from here.. Sequel or otherwise",Suicide Squad
1015,donuts_69,"Think ""X-Men: Apocalypse"", by DC",4,9 August 2016,"Where did it all go wrong? It's a question I've asked myself after seeing all the recent Super Hero movies, bar the sassy Deadpool. In a world where studios are constantly trying to outdo each other in the superhero movie wars, a few major things seem to be being left behind (or on the cutting room floor). The marketing/publicity surrounding Suicide Squad in the build up to its release, pointed to a movie based heavily around Jared Leto's ""Joker"" and a band of new (in screen format at least) characters from the DC universe. It looked fun, the way Deadpool was fun. And that's where I found the most disappointment during the actual watching of Suicide Squad.It's basically a complete reheat of the recent and equally dire, X-Men: Apocalypse. Government rounds up super heroes (supposedly the most evil on the planet) for use as a defence force against the possibility of a super power based terror event. It just so happens that within moments of the team being brought into custody by one of DC's main money earners, that such an event transpires and they are thrown into action. The villain in question is so similar to the last Xmen outing, its hard to believe. For reasons beyond logic, the only way this demi-god plans the destruction of the human race, is by building a weapon that will take long enough for our Squad to battle their way in and save the day. Never mind that this villain can already destroy large city blocks and structures without needing to build anything......The movie, after giving us 30mins of backstory and reasons why the Squad are ""oh-so-evil"", then goes into a mish mash of action/dialogue sequences that require your brain to left on standby. Some of the questions raised include; If the demi god has already enslaved so many locals into becoming hybrid monsters that can battle through head shots then isn't that another effective way to destroy humans without wasting time building something to blow everything up??? How many helicopter crashes can one team survive??? Why do we keep getting backstory to give heart to characters that are intentionally presented initially to be evil? We don't care about these characters anyway. Apart from Will Smith, who does what he can with the movies most fleshed out character, there's no one in this film you really care about or even want to see killed off. The quips and jokes are almost always off target, mistimed or misdelivered leaving characters feeling unnatural and ""forced crazy"". The normal humans are probably more evil than the actual Squad....The biggest question; Why is Joker even in this film? It's obvious that DC have a cash cow in Joker and obviously being at the heart of the marketing campaign, everyone was buzzing about how Jared Leto would pick up the character brought to colorful life by Ledger, Nicholson and the cartoonish Romero. You have to say, Leto's interpretation is closely aligned with the comic version of the Joker and that's great. But why is he in THIS film? He has no more purpose in the plot, than Deadshots Daughter has. Being that Harley Quinn/Deadshot are emotionally tied to their mirror characters and that being the only reason for their appearances in the film.So, as far as similarities with ""Apocalypse"" goes, DC follows suit with this effort - right down to cameo appearance of their respective universe's most iconic character.It's a shame that something promoted with such color and fun was delivered in the now tiring, uninspiring fashion that has seen the super hero genre descend into the realms of the now obsolete ""Found Footage"" category.",Suicide Squad
1016,nickyeskens,Fan service galore,4,9 January 2017,"When I first heard about Suicide Squad I got excited, but the more was released about the movie, the less i wanted to see it. Now I've seen it, I wish I didn't. The story was lazy and cheap, and really didn't make sense at all. Every choice made in this movie was weird. And it was weird because every choice was made to 'progress' the characters. This movie already started of lazily introducing the characters, and after that throwing in some random characters that weren't introduced yet, you know just because. The only characters I liked were, Diablo, Deadshot and Amanda Waller. They seemed to be the characters they managed to finish and give actual personality. The rest like Australia man (Captain boomerang), Unfunny sexy crazy girl (Harley Quinn), Captain America and his white Mayan goddess??? (Rick Flag and The Enchantress) where so badly written, it was cringy. I'm not even mentioning the Joker because that was one hot mess, if this doesn't ruin Jared Leto's career, I don't know what will. I really don't know why people hype over Harley Quinn, don't get me wrong. Margot Robbie is not a terrible actress, its mostly due writing her character was bad. Her one-liners were so bad, I had to pause the movie at times. Her character was pushed way to much as a quirky crazy girl without really explaining why. Yet people LOVE her, while her and Joker where the worst characters of the movie. The story was cheap and purely character driven, nothing wrong with that, but at least include all characters within the story and connect them to it. Why did Killer Croc ever come back? Why didn't they kill Amanda Waller or Rick Flagg? They could have done that with ease. Where did they get Katana from? Why did she go with them? Why does every character have a sad sob story that needed to be told? Why the hell was Harley Quinn a sexy girl dancing in a club? Why was The Joker a gangster and why did he drive a purple lambo? Why? why? why? Why was it always night? Why was it so dark and gritty, while the writing of the movie definitely did not feel dark and gritty?This movie was a prime example of 'easy money grab' They didn't even try to make this a good movie. They choose the suicide squad BECAUSE of Harley Quinn, and that meant they could use the Joker (To be fair not really though, no clue why he was in the movie). This whole movie was fan service to advance a story in the DC cinematic universe in a very lazy way. Fan service is okay, but at least do it in a good way and don't write characters out of character.",Suicide Squad
1017,Markk-455-632687,Better Film Than Most Want To Believe,8,11 April 2017,"Will Smith, Jared Leto and Margot Robbie lead the charge in this villain powered story of saving the world. First off, Jared Leto is not as good of a Joker as Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson or even Cesar Romero. He is the easiest to hate Joker to ever appear on screen. In that sense, it's a good thing as he is a villain. Margot Robbie was the perfect choice and my pick for Harley Quinn before she was even officially cast. She delivers the best female Batman villain performance in movie history. She also steals the show in every scene she's in. Will Smith's performance as Deadshot was 100x better than I thought it was going to be. The character conflict and growth between Deadshot and Rick Flag is an amazing process to watch play out. Killer Croc is brought to screen very well also.",Suicide Squad
1018,aya-baclao,Minus 5 stars for Cara Delevigne's belly-dancing alone. YIKES.,4,31 August 2021,"2 stars for Margot Robbie (perfect Harley!!!), 1 star for Viola Davis, and 1 star for whoever made the trailers because that person tricked us all into thinking this movie was going to be good.The dialogue was so cringey, boring (there was literally dead air in the bar scene), Jared Leto's Joker was embarassing as a DC fan, forgettable characters, and CARA DELEVIGNE'S BELLY-DANCING MADE ME WANT TO WALK OUT OF THE THEATER. What the hell was that??",Suicide Squad
1019,japhetaguirre,"Great first half, so-so 3rd act...",7,15 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a film about a group of villains forced to work for the government on suicide mission hence, the name ""SUICIDE SQUAD"" a.k.a. Task Force X. And these are group of actual villains---not outlaws or some anti-hero---that came from the rouges gallery of some superheroes like Batman and Flash. Among these ""villains"", the standout performance is Deadshot played by Will Smith. Watching the trailer, I was worried that he would not do the character justice. But Will Smith's Will Smith. Margot Robbie is as good as you expect her to be as Harley even without the quirky Harley voice from the cartoons and video games. She's a good and beautiful actress, so no worries there. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller is powerful and scary--in a good way, that is. And as for Mister J: well, he has a few scenes and Jared Leto's Joker is scary and very unpredictable. Imagine having a friend treating you to a diner and the next thing he'll do is hit your head with the plate just for laughs. That's how this Joker is. But this Joker is more comic book-y than the previous incarnations. And I'm very interested on how this Joker would go toe-to-toe with Ben Affleck's bad-ass Batman. As for the plot, it's a little predictable. You know, generic super villains with generic henchmen that pose no threat at all but it does not bother me that much. The problem is the characters or how they are given importance. Some are very important, some are just there and others are just disposable. The studio should that this is the first live- action incarnation of these characters on film. Yes, you may know Captain Boomerang as villain of Flash and Killer Croc as Batman's villain but do you know who the eff is Slipknot or Katana? But seeing as they are part of Task Force X, anybody could die any minute but it is still no excuse to not give these character importance. So, is it watchable? Yes. Very. Soundtrack alone is worth the admission. This is the third film in the DCEU following Man of Steel and BvS and is the most lighthearted in terms of tone amongst the three. Humors are spot on on this film. This film is a small step expanding the DC universe where Batman and Superman exist but it could have been a great leap. As for a DC comic reader, watching these characters on the big screen is a real treat and so many easter eggs. It may have a generic and predictable plot but it is still good and even better and awesome soundtrack.",Suicide Squad
1020,cocopunk1486,"It's not perfect, but it's a step in the right direction for DC",8,16 August 2016,"You can't give half rating on IMDb, but for all intense purposes I give this movie a 7.5/10. It's not perfect, the script is pretty standard for an ""anti-hero"" film (though the dialogue is spot on), the overall plot is fairly generic, and as far as the story telling goes, things are choppy. The plot moves quickly, so if you step out for a second you're likely to miss something. But it is funny, and has great visuals. The effects used for the Enchantress are some of my favorites. The comedy snuck in is in good taste and well timed. It's not like Deadpool, where it's all about the laughs and watching the titular character shoot people (not dumping on Deadpool, I really enjoyed that movie). SS is more like a humorous version of the Avengers. You've got the powerhouse (Diablo), the two conflicting leaders (Rick Flag and Deadshot), the femme fatale (Katana), the muscle (Killer Croc), the seemingly useless one (Boomerang), and then there's the wild card in Harley Quinn. The characters backstories are kind of thrown at you very bluntly, but overall the writers did a decent job on each. Would really be interested in seeing more from Boomerang and Katana in the future. Acting is top notch, Will Smith leads a great cast and gives a solid performance as Deadshot. The real scene stealers are Jared Leto and Margot Robbie, whose chemistry as the Joker and H.Q are superb. I'm hoping they go through with the Harley spin off and include more of the Joker/Harley story (throw in Poison Ivy and I'm sold) All in all, this is a good movie. Not perfect, not terrible, and not to be missed. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. It's not nearly as ""bad"" as all the critics say it is. It stays true enough to the comics, and the cameos from Batman and Flash are nice touches. Hopefully the cast and crew will learn from the mistakes they've made here and deliver a great sequel in two years.",Suicide Squad
1021,Impsman,I blame HBO,8,7 August 2016,"=======this review contains minor spoilers=====I have seen and thoroughly enjoyed Suicide Squad, and am genuinely mystified by the hatred it is currently generating, especially from film critics. This has got me thinking over why this would be the case and I have come to the conclusion that critics are expecting too much from what is essentially a two hour bit of fun and escapism.This is why I am blaming HBO for those responses. They have the time and space over five/six years to develop characters to such a level that the simple scene of one character 'holding a door' is brilliant, inventive and gets the viewer to reassess almost six years of development in one scene. A two hour film doesn't have that time or space, and I get the impression that critics often forget this when they point out an underdeveloped character brought in for five minutes with the clear plan to kill them off within that time.What you get with Suicide Squad is an enjoyable comic book Dirty Dozen ( well not quite that number but you get the drift) where you are never going to get all characters with a full backstory nor an equal number of lines or scenes, but all make their mark as required and I do include Slipknot in that.Now I'm not suggesting that it's perfect. It suffers from the usual ending of quick cut blowing things up school of filming and the end decisions of the big bad to engage in hand to hand combat is just plain stupid, but on the whole a cracking rompGo in, settle down and don't try to overthink what's on the screen and you'll enjoy as wellPS....as a little aside I've read comments over the misleading trailers which suggested that Joker would be the protagonist. I often complain about trailers giving too much away. This trailer has served a big red herring and I applaud the makers for this. More of the same pleaseThat said more of Leto's Mr J would be very welcome and I look forward to his involvement in The Batman",Suicide Squad
1022,Koodle0101,Movie Had Potential but Fell Short.,5,14 August 2016,"-SPOILERS-I really want to like this movie, I really do. I like all the actors/actresses (Especially Will Smith), but unfortunately I'm not here to rate the actors, I'm here to rate the movie. The problem with this movie is not the actors/actresses, rather, everything else.The movie is weak in all other aspects. To get the villain out of the way, she's a strong witch that I actually liked a lot. Unfortunately, she got dumb down to a 'stupid' villain that could destroy the world but doesn't. Instead, she wastes time dancing and doing pesky things that does nothing but buy the Suicide Squad time to stop her, of course. The witch and her brother pretty much took over the whole city, killing the army like it's butter and not getting harmed by anything thrown at them. This is ridiculous because guess how they died? The witch was cut with a sword and the brother was killed with a bomb, one that really shouldn't be powerful enough to stop him. This very anti-climatic outcome got me shaking my head and saying to myself, 'really? lame!' (Extremely unbelievable and hard to buy)Moving on to the humor. It's painful to say the least. Most of the humor in the movie don't just feel rushed, they ARE rushed and you know it. I cringed more than a couple times at how awkward and embarrassing the jokes were and something tells me there's no way in hell the actors didn't feel the same way. Removing all of the cheesy 'one-liners' will make the movie many times better. The suicide squad is more of like the suicide duo. The whole movie is focused on Deadshot and Harley Quinn, with the rest thrown in so they can change 'duo' to 'squad.' They rarely get screen time, they don't get a decent introduction or backstory. They rarely talk or have any dialogue at all and to make it worse, they're usually the ones making the lame and cheesy jokes. Most of them aren't even needed and their attempt to cover that up with a simple scene for each person wasn't enough to convince me. It was like me playing varsity basketball in school. I was benched all season until finals, never made a shot, played a few seconds near the end, got a few assists, and got my gold medal. Yea, baby!Joker... what a joke! (Not in a good way). I actually liked the actor, he did a great job and I enjoyed seeing him. The problem, again, has nothing to do with the actors. You pretty saw all there was to see of the Joker in the trailers, minus a few short scenes that shows him saving Harley Quinn. Doesn't really make a big impact in the movie as just kind of just 'there.' Amanda Waller, the person who was responsible for everything that happened was not very convincing. They keep trying to present her as some sort of hardcore 'bad-ass' but she really doesn't seem like it. She comes off as a 'tryhard' and someone who you think would have been killed a long time ago but for some reason, she's still alive. And that is confusing and it takes away from the experience. Even Deadshot makes a comment on it near the end of the movie.Story/pacing is pretty much like what people are saying. It's a two hour movie that feels like it's only 30 minutes long, but not in a good way. You sit down, feel like the movie just started, start to get ready for the good stuff to happen, nothing happens and it's over. It feels like it's only 30 minutes long because it feels like there's not much to it. To make the movie better they need to cut out the bad jokes and one- liners. They need to have more character backstory/development or have the characters be more involved with each other. They need to give the villains a brain and have them actually pose a threat and force the protagonists to actually collaborate with each other, learn something new or become more creative to stop the villain. Not dumb down the villain so they all essentially kill themselves.",Suicide Squad
1023,varunvtkr,It's like eating a good pizza that leaves this weird stench in your mouth,5,6 August 2016,"I'm going to divide my review in negatives and positives-Positives- The actors did an amazing job with what they had. Most of the characters were convincing and kept you in your seat. Amanda Waller, Deadshot, Rick Flagg and Harley Quinn are the aces in this movie. The movie has a good balance of action and humor. Every character has perfect screen time.Negatives- The editing of this movie was horrible at times and jarring. The plot is very generic and weak. Having an amazing set of characters doesn't save this movie from it's plot holes. The villain of this movie needed more love from the writing department.I couldn't properly judge Leto's Joker, I need more of him in future movies to get a good assumption. DC needs to make movies for general audience, I gave it a 5 being a DC fan, any other average person would've scored it less. I can understand why certain people bashed it and why some loved it. As for me, I would say it's an average popcorn flick. It's not bad but it's not good.",Suicide Squad
1024,rikandum-205,"Another Product for our Viewing Pleasure, Succeeds at Entertaining",6,8 August 2016,"After Batman v Superman, which I did like, the expectations for this movie went high. I thought, well BvS has its flaws and critics were kinda harsh, I think Warner and DC will save the great stuff for the summer and bring something new to the genre. Turns out, this movie only succeeds at entertaining because there's quite a lot of things that went wrong here.Directed by David Ayer, known from Fury, which I didn't like much but still think it's a good movie, the expectations were high and with so many new interesting things to give to the franchise, I was hoping this would be better than most super-heroes movies this year, if not the best. But things went wrong too soon.The writing was unbelievable at certain points. I'd like to leave here a line that the Enchatress said near the end of the movie that was so cringe worthy it took some time to sink in, let's just say it has something to deal with balls. The acting was some of the worst I've seen lately, even from someone like Will Smith who is still a great actor even though he has been in some bad movies lately. Not sure if the writing or the directing is to blame, but in the end that doesn't really matter. Although, I have to admit Jai Courtney did pull off a great Australian accent and kept his acting good, so did Viola Davis which I think had the best performance during the whole flick, and was one of the most interesting characters.Joker was great, I think it's new, it's different and I can't wait to see more of him in the movies ahead. Harley Quinn was OK. Sure Margot Robbie has the looks but her character was the most predictable and although the movie tries, it never brings a solid emotional connection. Deadshot and Harley had a pretty natural relationship since Smith and Robbie have already co-starred in a movie called ""Focus"" which I enjoyed very much. The squad is pretty unbalanced, I don't think someone really cared about Killer Croc, all he did was deliver a couple of lines and swim in the sewers, he's the most forgettable. Katana didn't get much attention, considering this character has a strong background, you end up not caring much about her though. The flames guy looked pretty bad-ass and his story was one of the best definitely. Boomerang was fine, he's responsible for getting Flash to make an appearance and that's all I can say. Deadshot didn't feel like the legit hit-man he is, that's probably because Will Smith can't make himself unlikable and we're to much used to see him portray the hero. Harley's best moments are in the trailers, and I've seen about two trailers, I didn't even know who the villain's villain was. Harley feels really, really out of place here. Everyone's caring guns and heavy suits and she's half naked with a baseball bat. I know her character is fearless but it doesn't feel right, you never get the feeling of danger when she's around 'cause you already know she's not going to die and cuts the intensity out of the fights. The Enchantress looked stunning and seemed threatening, but she was defeated in a pretty dumb way that makes you question what kind of powers did she really have. As I was watching the movie I felt like it was calling me dumb. There's no complexity in the story, and the songs they used were stuff everybody has already listened to, just to make it appealing. It's so simple it's frustrating, this movie needed more and even though a lot was rushed, more time wouldn't save from being what I was expecting.Production design is really great, it surely will become memorable in a few years. Visual effects were pretty great as expected from a movie with this much budget, I'm just really tired to see blue lightning shooting up into the sky in super hero movies. I could make a very respectable list of super hero movies that have a ""blue lightning shooting through the sky"" scene somewhere.This movie is a missed shot that may compromise what's expected from this franchise. It doesn't deserve what the most awful critics are saying about it, it's worth to watch and entertaining but not much else really.",Suicide Squad

1026,basildonboroughfc-53-110251,Very disappointing,6,8 August 2016,"I'm not a comic book fan (graphic novel?! Yeah, right!) so know nothing about the original story or characters.The trailer made the film look amazing! Great action, explosions, design etc. It turned out that the trailer contained all the best parts of the film and was enough for you to say you'd now seen 'Suicide Squad'.By far the highlight of the film was Margot Robbie. She continues to show shy she is a first class Hollywood draw and one of the most beautiful women in the World. Her performance as 'Harley Quinn' contained scenes of humour, fear, anger etc etc etc and all were brilliant. Her backside got plenty of screen time, probably more through design than luck.Well Smith played his usual role of Will Smith.Cara Delevingne, who I'd never heard of and was surprised to hear is a model, was very wooden. I'm sure a far better casting choice could have been made.A lot of the earlier scenes jumped around and made little sense. There were several lines of speech that were incoherent.The film did not live up to the trailer, the storyline was thin and short-lived. It wasn't a terrible film, but it's not great. In the long run it will be remembered as another edition to the long list of poor DC Comic films like the terrible 90's Batman films and all the awful Superman films. The future releases don't look good either. It was nowhere near as bad as Batman v Superman!",Suicide Squad
1027,TheJibber,Better than I anticipated it would be,6,7 August 2016,"The reviews for this movie were pretty harsh. I don't think the movie was awful like a lot of people made it out to be. As you would expect, Margot Robbie stole the show as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto's Joker had mixed reviews (I thought he did a great job), Will Smith as Deadshot was great; I was expecting to like him as much as I did. I feel like there were some characters that should've gotten more screen time or character development, but a lot of movies are like that these days. The plot line is a little dull, boring, and whack. The movie strays from the plot line at points, but overall it was okay.I give this movie a 7/10, and I would definitely recommend people seeing the movie because in my opinion it is better than BvS.",Suicide Squad
1028,thrashertm,"Lame plot, boring action",4,8 October 2016,"The plot was very really weak and the action scenes were boring. It was mostly fighting endless hordes of faceless creatures like a low- budget B-movie - think Equilibrium with Christian Bale or Delta Force 2 with Chuck Norris.It also seemed rather pointless to send the suicide squad in with special forces, when the whole point of their existence is to avoid the need to risk the lives of ""good guys"". A far more interesting plot would have involved the SS being sent on a mission that purports to be for the greater good, when in fact it's for some nefarious scheme - perhaps stealing money, destabilizing a govt. or assassinating someone etc. Hell, it would have been interesting to make the movie political and send the SS squad into a war-zone like Ukraine or Yemen.Instead we got a real snoozer here.",Suicide Squad
1029,baqari-com,a really slow burner...ish,9,8 August 2016,"no point in describing this movie. you just have to make up your own mind about it. some parts are better than awesome and some are meh...lets start with origins: really poor! i think the original cuts were better and the reediting turned it into a joke(pun intended). batman appearance in Deadshots origins is acceptable, except the guy who lost his parents in the dark alley wouldn't haunt anyone with the kid in that type of dark alley. next Harley's introduction was way too simplified. the real gem here was the acid jump scene that was done better than any flashback i have seen before. just awesome.next the joker! i feel like the laugh was just not good! the only moments this guy looked like a real character was when he had a serious face! just watch him when he says careful! and you'll know what i mean! Jarred did great job, but they didn't let him shine the way he could, given more screen time and better lines.now as for Deadshot: every scene where he is shooting are awesome, but when he shoots on top of the car, i was taken by surprise. it was cooler, than i expected.music through the movie is a bit too much! i get it it's supposed to b fun, but know your limits! it's not a music video! it's a movie! but i'm saying this only about the songs, used! and their over usage in the beginning of the movie! but the Ost-s were awesome. particularly the one during the squad walk and the Diablo outrage! just epic! speaking of it, i felt like every scene after the bar drinking scene was from the directors cut, cause it was much better, than the rest! just pure cinematic ecstasy! overall: next time Warner Bros. let the directors do the editing! stop messing with their work! you messed up one movie this year already - BvS, was it necessary to mess up the other? cause you managed to mess it up badly! i hope you'll have courage to release director's cut later, cause this story deserves it!",Suicide Squad
1030,archiesmith,A great cast of characters who are unfortunately stuck in a disappointingly mediocre film.,2,6 August 2016,"Although finding 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' a decent film despite some major flaws, I thought DC could have done a better effort kick starting their Extended Universe. So naturally, I thought 'Suicide Squad' would be the one to properly get the ball rolling in terms of solid quality. With its ensemble cast, and the amazing trailers that have been dropped, I was naturally excited to see this film, and it is my second most anticipated film of the year. Now, after over a year of waiting, I finally got to see it. However, once again, DC has delivered another just average film that misses the mark, and I have to say it is probably the most disappointing film I've seen this year. It's by no means bad, far from the negative bashing it's been receiving by critics, but it just has so many issues that they ultimately tarnish my overall enjoyment.Okay, so what's good? Firstly, the cast. About 90% of them were absolutely terrific. DC seems to always manage to stick the landing with it's casting. Margot Robbie delivers the best performance in the film. Despite looking more like a pale skinned cheerleader than Harley Quinn, she is the epitome of Harley, as she conveys that mix between sexiness, comedy, and insanity of the character. She seems to be having the most fun with her role, and I had the most fun watching her as well. Will Smith rarely fails to deliver in a role and as Deadshot, this is yet another example. The man oozes with charisma like he always does, and I found him to be one of the more surprising characters, as he undoubtedly had the best story arc. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is pretty solid in her role, who is probably the most threatening of all the characters. Other nods go out to El Diablo, who I found intriguing. I also thought he had one of the best roles in the climax. I really like Killer Croc as well, despite him not contributing much until the climax. It was difficult to understand what he was saying half the time though. Ben Affleck cameos as Batman, which is not really a spoiler, who I still think is the best on screen Batman. And Jai Courtney as Boomerang didn't suck. Yay. And finally Jared Leto as the Joker. He was the one I was most looking forward too, obviously because he is the Joker, and he is my favourite comic character. I thought Leto did a pretty good job. Each scene he was in, he was very interesting enjoyable to watch, and despite his limited screen time (which is about 10-12 minutes), I wanted to see more of him. However, his role in the film was pretty pointless. He didn't contribute anything to the plot whatsoever. Due to only being in a hand full of scenes, it's hard to compare him to other on screen Jokers, as we don't get to see what motivates him and makes him tick. Also, I don't remember him telling any jokes. His name is the Joker, right? Even Heath Ledger told jokes. Hopefully, we will get to see more of Leto's Joker in future installments, especially the Solo Batman Movie, as I liked this portrayal of the character. Another positive factor is the humour, which is great to see after the practically humourless 'Man of Steel' and 'Bvs'. However, for those who don't like how those movies were dark, this does not change here, as it has a pretty gloomy atmosphere and sinister elements. Speaking of the plot, now onto the negatives. The story-line is pretty weak. It does not try anything new in terms of storytelling, and once again, a comic-movie revolves around a big blue portal in the sky. I got sick of this with 'Fan4stic' The villain is also pretty dull, whose performance was just awful, and I didn't understand their motivations or plan. If you have seen the film by now, you'll understand. However, the worst offender is the editing. It is some of the worst editing I have ever seen in a film. Especially, in the first half- hour, where a pop song is played every minute. And the pacing is all over the place. The character's introductions are so rushed, and there isn't really a moment that slows down and let the audience get to know them better until the second act. It is even more disappointing when the majority of these scenes are good, but when they are put together, they lack any transition or coherency. I would have to say, if it wasn't for the cast, the humour and some scenes, I believe I would have disliked this film. Overall, 'Suicide Squad' has a great cast of characters who are unfortunately stuck in a disappointingly mediocre film. I am unsure whether this to be blamed on the studio or the director, David Ayer, as he has directed good films like 'Fury'. I did enjoy it for the most part, but it's discouraging that at this point, the DCEU has yet to deliver a relatively great installment to their franchise. I actually don't want to see a sequel to this, and would rather have these characters appear in other films, especially Deadshot, Harley, Joker and Amanda Waller. I still recommend people to go see it, but to see it with low expectations, so they are not disappointed like I was.",Suicide Squad

1033,georgehogg,A fine example of people's obsession with negativity,7,9 October 2016,"I have never ever seen a film with any of these characters in, and I have to say, I found this film good. Not great, but above decent. Look past the misleading trailer and you have a fine action thriller. The two characters who I particularly liked were Harley and Deadshot. I found Deadshot to be fine as the ""man of few words"", and Margot Robbie'a performance was just Stellar! She is clearly having as much of a blast with the performance as I did seeing her act! I've heard Jared Leto getting a lot of flack for his performance as The Joker, but I have said before, I've never seen him portrayed in any other movie, and I found him decent (But more when he was acting with other characters than on his own).It's not an emotional thrill ride, but it's certainly an entertaining one. This is from the perspective of someone who is not really much of a DC, or even a superhero fan, and was bored by ""legendary"" titles like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Civil War"", so take in mind that not everyone who likes this film is a ""DC Fanboy"".",Suicide Squad
1034,diedrichfilms,Wonderful film!,4,5 August 2016,"Suicide Squad great film showing just how complicated the DC universe can be. With wonderful performances by Will Smith and Margot Robbie, as well as terrific special and practical effects, David Ayer really comes through. Although critics hate it, the film does have beautiful cinematography and great action-packed choreography. It is definitely better than its previously made partner film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, however it does have its own subtle flaws. It is a very odd film and is executed almost perfectly. Do go watch this movie, it will definitely be worth your tine and money! You will NOT be disappointed, even through its few flaws. This film begins with somewhat sleepable work and finishes strong with the final piece!",Suicide Squad
1035,zero-to-HERO,Be careful Reading Reviews From Non Comic Book Readers. Suicide Squad Is a Prime Example!,6,5 August 2016,"Like with so many Superhero setting movies, I've noticed that there is a fair amount of supposed critics that rate these movies knowing nothing about the comic origins, including some of the canons of these great Characters. I wish these same critics would stop rating Superhero movies because they are giving it an unfair review with their murky at best knowledge (and I'm sure not all fall in this bracket but a fair amount do). I'd rather listen to comic reader's points of view when it comes to Superheroes and Supervillains coming to the big screen. That been said I'm not saying if you don't read comics and graphic novels not to go see these movies, all I'm trying to relay is if your reading reviews, try to focus from people who know these worlds and these characters over people who review almost everything just for the sake of conforming with current movie trends.And onto my quick burst review: As a comic reader myself I've decided to separate the Characters in the Suicide Squad from 'A' rated Superheroes/ Supervillains. You've got to remember that the characters in Suicide Squad are 'B' rated Characters (sometimes even 'C' rated). If you could do that then you will enjoy the movie more. For me it was a terrific ride full of action, a bit of comedy, and with a decent Character background story.The scenery was dark yet luminous which was perfect for this type of movie. All the actors and actresses played their parts quite nicely. From Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) to Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), and El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez). The Enchantress/Witch was supposed to be creepy and mysterious and Cara Delevingne delivered just that! And best of all were Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. You feel for Deadshot because you see what makes him tick and his background story bridges a bit of emotion with captivating intrigue. When it came to Harley Quinn, I didn't see how the Suicide Squad team could have valued anything from Harley Quinn's abilities (but of course they found a way to mix her in with the team). This I base on the type of mission the cast was given to undergo in this movie (I don't want to give any spoilers so you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean). That been said how Margot Robbie portrayed Harley Quinn as the actual standalone Character was done close to perfection! And as a Harley Quinn fan that was good enough for me!I found myself with conflicting viewpoints with Jarod Leto's rendition of the Joker. It almost felt like he tried to mimic and/or add Heath Ledger's Jokers antics into his Joker - for me a tattoo punk/gangster looking Joker to use those Characteristics (if that was the case) didn't really work for me. I can't really say that he was a poor adaptation of the Joker either, but I will say there was a lot of room for improvement - in correlation to the style and type of this Joker they tried to portray in this flick.Final verdict: As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the key point here is if you can recognize that these zany misfits called the Suicide Squad are not classified as 'A' list status Superheroes and should not be compared to them, then it's quite probable that you will enjoy this film, and to be fair that's how this movie should be looked at/reviewed. Would I recommend this movie? Yes I would, especially if you go into the movie not expecting empyrean like Superhero statuses. And finally, I would like to stress that if they decide to develop another installment of Suicide Squad that it really should be an R- rated film. Then it would truly be Suicide Squad personified.",Suicide Squad

The dialogue is simple and plain, the plot is very convenient and juvenile, the characters are silly, and overall, the film just isn't that great if you focus on those things. The fight scenes and action sequences though, are good for what the movie is worth. If you go into this movie wanting to watch something that'll just let you turn your brain off and watch the sexy Harley Quinn and The Joker wreak havoc, then you might just like this one.

Most of it is filmed in really poor lighting which might have worked in the cinema but on the small screen it really doesn't so many scenes are to dark to see what's happening. It's an odd thing that many films which have a star studded cast turn out to be the worst films I've watched. At least I watched it on Netflix so only wasted time watching it.

1041,TorsoDahlia,A Complete Mess Unfortunately (Contains Spoilers),4,5 August 2016,"As a person who leans towards DC over Marvel I was extremely disappointed with what I just witnessed a couple of hours ago. A complete mess which ruins the spirit of the comics in my view. Will Smith is the lead. The latter says it all right there. Not good. Now I can see why Tom Hardy dropped out (few of us buy the scheduling conflicts excuse after Smiths role grew). So what we have here is a squad of supposed super villains who are anything but. B and C list actors playing villains nobody would really care about outside of Quinn and Joker who is not even in the squad (sorry guys). A couple supposedly bad ass sociopaths are crying in the film and are all about helping each other and smiling. Are you serious? That felt more Marvel there. Still, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller is the only real redeemable thing about the film in my view. Leto's joker is not as terrible as one is lead to believe, but not very good either with what he's given to do. Take off the grills and ridiculous tattoos and a voice that doesn't seem to imitate Ledger at times and you have a pretty decent Joker. I went in thinking Quinn would steal the movie and to some she might. I found her annoying and over the top which on one hand makes sense, but also her ever changing accents (extremely painful to hear I might add) and mad skills fighting wise does not add up. The critical reviews are legit. I went in with no true opinion and left wanting my money back. If you are not in the 10-14 year old range I can't imagine you liking this, but then again I've seen weirder things.",Suicide Squad

The movie was an interesting take on some of the characters, Will Smith did an amazing job as deadshot and fit his personality well, that goes for Margot Robbie, and Viola Davis. The movie does feel a bit weaker with the cgi then BVS (Batman vs Superman) and MOS (man of steel) and a huge controversy is the Joker in this film, which is seen mainly for Harley Quinn's back story.

1046,Orki72,Any good screenwriter gets suicidal after seeing this movie,5,8 August 2016,"Before I begin I just want to all to know that I neither a Marvel fanboy nor a DC one. I enjoyed superhero movies for most of the time till they began to spread out like - I don't think of another better comparison - cancer with all the sequels, prequels, reboots and stuff. But moviegoers still seem to enjoy most of these films. IMHO this genre peaked with the Nolan/Batman trilogy and had some great other ones like Iron Man, The Avengers, Guardians, Deadpool i.e.The whole concept of the story behind Suicide Squad seems like a farce. The filmmakers are throwing names, characters, resume's towards us like there is no tomorrow. I asked myself in the first half hour if I forgot to watch the one before. There is not an elaborated background story at all except for the Joker/Harley part. There isn't a plausible reason why the Squad is formed to a squad. There isn't any logic behind any decision of the members of the Squad. So if any movie of his magnitude hasn't got a decent story, you began to watch out for flaws - and there are many of them.First one, casting. Cara Delevingne is the miscast of the century. Although she was really okay in Paper Towns and The Face Of An Angel - this one is a total fail. It was like watching the villain in the Stargate movie all over again. Jared Leto's Joker is of course not comparable to Heath Ledger's Joker. But he fails to deliver badly, mainly because of his voice, hairdo and mask - he is like Jim Carrey as The Riddler in a bad way.Than, the soundtrack. I like most of the songs. The Rain from Orange ""Juice"" Jones - just great to hear this one again. But the whole ""let's take some of the known hits of the last 25 years"" doesn't fall in place, it's like a mash-up gone wrong. They are playing The White Stripes and you are thinking ""really? this one?"".On the plus side you have Margot Robbie who is the best character and she steals almost every scene in this. She has the best one-liners and gags of all the Squad members. Will Smith played well - he was back in acting shape. So why went this wrong? I think that the filmmakers wanted to avoid comparisons to Guardians or Watchmen. And they wanted too much. A superhero saga with seven (or even more?) characters yet unknown to the moviegoers. So they hadn't got time and place for character development.Now comes the spoiler part: I would have started with the Flag/Moone relationship as Moone is the key element of the story. Starting with this, they could've blended into the whole government Squad building program. Maybe thrown in some other members or army people, just to have some kind of a solid backstory. Well, they didn't.So it gets a very unfulfilled 5/10",Suicide Squad

1048,rkaliz,Just a collection of one-liners.,5,27 April 2017,"Suicide squad is the one thing that is probably the worst thing for any movie to be – boring. It is made up of a few punch lines, a few clever one-liners and a lot of clichés. It is also cheap. The Enchantress' (probably expensive) CGI scenes are kept to a minimum, while the movie basically unfolds with a lot of talking and action scenes which are mostly made up of combat between actors in normal clothing and stunts in rubber suits – wow awesomeThe movie's ""ethic"" dilemmas are also ridiculous, corny and nothing new, the plot has zero twist, the entire thing flows from beginning to end as expected, right down to the survival of ""the guy's sweetheart that was trapped in the witch's body"". The brewing Japanese woman with a katana is present, the gaudy Australian with his overplayed accent is present, the crazy girl in shorts holding a baseball bat is present, the friendly monster is present, the assassin who loves his daughter is present; everything exactly as expected.

1049,mbyrne_1664,So much potential. So little on delivery,3,22 October 2016,"I will start by saying I started watching Suicide Squad with an open mind and actually looked forward to seeing what road this film would take us on.As soon as the movie started certain things started to agitate me. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn being one of them, her character was quite enjoyable but her accent kept on changing from scene to scene. Jared Leto's Joker not only looked awful but was awful in every sense of the word. Joker looked like a pimp on heroin, his laugh felt forced and not naturally crazy at all and the love story between him and Harley was far too soppy, it was like they had to get a love story in. It was like the writers/director hadn't read anything into the actual chaotic abusive and betrayal heavy relationship the Joker and Harley have. As far as the other characters go you get what you expect from Will Smith, if you like him as I do he probably makes this movie a bit more watchable although it is a samey performance from him. The biggest shame came from the fact the smaller characters really made the film a bit better, adding humour and likable moments. Boomerang and Diablo were enjoyable characters to watch as well as Enchantress, although some characters were just pointless as they didn't really do anything like Killer Croc. Viola Davis was brilliant as Amanda Waller embodying the sternness and efficiency of the character well. To sum up this film had potential but collapse under it's own hype and did not live up to expectations. Even characters like Deadshot played second fiddle to a soppy love story between Harley and the Joker.

Jared Leto as the Joker sparked a lot of debate with his performance, I feel he did a good job and generally wanted to see more and more of him throughout the film and hope he does feature in another D.C.

Margot Robbie & Will Smith worked well together as Harley Quinn & Deadshot as the two main characters & felt that their origin stories were quite intriguing as to how they ended up in prison & came to be the way they are. -The storyline between the joker & Harley Quinn - I felt was more interesting than the actual main plot of the movie and hope this storyline between them & how the joker corrupted Harley gets explored in more detail in another movie (hopefully the Harley Quinn solo movie) -The soundtrack, most of the songs were quite good & mostly suited the mood of the film.The bad:-The main story - felt this was a bit of a let down as the squad basically just had to stop a portal in the sky which we have now seen several times in movies over the last few years e.g the avengers & TMNT-The villain - did not like Enchantress as the villain, she was way to powerful for most of them in the squad (except Diablo) & did have to question why some of them where there & to what they could actually do to stop enchantress. Felt I would have enjoyed them Going up against the joker or having someone more human like him as the villain instead.-The pacing - Went from the origin stories to all of sudden trying to stop the super powers of enchantress, felt this was brought on very suddenly & didn't allow much time to develop the characters - which leads me to.......-Supporting cast - some of the characters such as Killer Croc & Captain Boomerang, I would have liked to know more about their origin stories which perhaps could have been done in another movie. Killer Croc was very underutilized, Kitana & slipknot don't even know why they were in the movie & Rick Flag just seem to love struck by Enchantress to be the leader of the squad. Captain Boomerang however was good in the scenes he was in. Maybe I had too high hopes for this movie, after Batman vs Superman which I actually enjoyed. I would like to see a more in depth sequel to this movie or perhaps a Harley Quinn solo movie exploring more of her and the Jokers relationship & would be quite happy if Margot Robbie & Jared Leto reprise these roles.",Suicide Squad
1054,joelhbk,Not perfect. But very entertaining,8,4 August 2016,"This is not the ""savior"" of DC films. So far I've liked both MOS and BvS but it's more likely than not that I'm in the minority. Out comes Suicide Squad and though it's not a home run that's gonna turn the game around, it's a solid hit. It has comedy that doesn't feel forced (looking at you Civil War) it doesn't jeopardize the character's villainous demeanor to make them more likable but they don't exploit the bad guy cliché either to a point where you can't relate to them unless you're pure evil. It's got some heart warming moments. The action is insane. Shaky cam a bit annoying sometimes, tho. Leto's Joker works but it's not as ""Joker-y"" as I guess most people expects. There are certain scenes where you kinda expect more to happen but yet it unfolds in quite a satisfying rhythm. Waller... *shivers* The villain was not that great. All skwad member have their moment to shine. It's got some pleasant surprises. The soundtrack is amazing!!! I'll definitely watch it again. I implore all of you, if you wanna watch it, do it. Don't let the critics influence your decision. Don't expect the movie to be perfect either and expand your perspective. You might not love it but you might at least enjoy the experience.",Suicide Squad
1055,bridle15,A wasted opportunity for DCs cinematic universe,4,25 July 2017,"I went into this film with reasonably high expectations (despite the fact that I generally dislike superhero movies) due to their predictable plots, 2 dimensional characters and cheesy jokes not to mention the reality that films such as this are being heartlessly made on a production line like canned food for profit not art as they should be. Anyway with that out of the way I thought ""well its DC (my preferred universe over Marvel) and it seems to have interesting characters that I may grow to like throughout the film as they develop."" I couldn't have been more wrong. The film opens with an extremely rushed introduction to the 'Heroes' or 'Villains' (however you want to look at it) with only a few minutes dedicated to an entire character we're supposed to like or at least like enough for the entire 2 hour run time (great). Overuse of popular songs in our introduction is an understatement (I thought I was watching countless music videos one after another, not an effective beginning at all). The tone of this film is all over the place one minute its light hearted and supposedly 'funny' and the next it cuts to the Joker shooting someone in the face for no apparent reason. Speaking of the Joker he could have been cut out of this movie and NOTHING would have changed. ""But I wonder why he was on all of the posters and ads"" you may ask, well I can answer that: MONEY! This goes for practically all superhero movies instead of making films that can stand on their own they need to connect to endless spin offs and sequels which some suckers will pay to see. The plot was another thing that didn't make sense Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis who created the 'Suicide Squad' was also the individual who caused the threat which caused the death of two members. The threat being the 'Enchantress' played by Cara Delevingne (who could not act or dance). Scenes seemed to flash backwards and forwards randomly and added nothing to the film. And despite the fact that this film was supposed to be 'Cool', 'edgy' and maybe kind of original we get the exact boring and pointless endings in many superhero films: the laser in the sky with the fitting ""I'm evil and I want to take over the world"" cliché. (another reason why I dislike these films). Another thing to add was the amount of awful looking CGI and bad villain soldier designs, for a $175 million budget! It is fairly obvious that I really didn't like this film but I will say that the concept was interesting if executed right, some of the flashbacks were intriguing- most notably the Jokers, the look of the main characters was fitting and the gritty aspects were nice. I just wanted those aspects and a coherent story with less characters so you'd have more time for the few therefore deeper and more meaningful backgrounds are established so you'd actually care when they died (or nearly did). If it was like 'Watchmen' which I thoroughly enjoyed and expected this to be it may have restored hope for DC and renewed my interest in superhero films as a whole. But I guess that was too much to ask....",Suicide Squad
1056,ikissedaguru,Baddies on a PG-13 Spree.,1,8 August 2016,"I went into the film open minded despite the critical reviews, but this film is a piece of crap. Not one likable character to root for and they are not bad villains as they are in the comic, often rather teary eyed and snuggly with each other. I can't believe that the creators of this movie could be so irresponsible as to mislead people about a subject that still struggles to be heard and understood in our society. Throw in Will Smith being the annoying, unrealistic lead with Harley Quinn's ever changing accent and you have the mess that is Suicide Squad. Despite all this, the vampire looking Joker is not terrible. He is not good either, but if you take away the ghetto look with the grills and tattoos and not imitating Ledgers voice, you might have had a somewhat decent performance. Sadly, the look ruins anything good. A plot that is severely lacking just like any of the characters who you honestly do not care if they live or die. DC failed again which disappoints me to no end.",Suicide Squad
1057,john_titmus,Dc falls flat in comparison to marvel yet again,2,18 August 2016,David Ayer is no Joss Whedon but could of done better than this. Throwing music in at every point... What was that an awful attempt to recreate what they did with Guardians of the Galaxy. The joker- the look was different but dialogue and delivery was poor. Jared Leto is no Heath Ledger. Ultimately he has failed the character almost as bad as Ben afleck fails batman. The plot is poorly constructed and editing is mistimed. Yes we get it will smith is a family favourite hero but don't change the characters bio to suit that. It turned the movie into a will smith fan film. If you've seen the clips/ trailers you've seen the best of this film. DC have an arsenal of dark rich characters and should their own against Marvel but other than the Christopher Nolan trilogy and man of steel the franchise is being flushed down the toilet... Well done sack Snyder.,Suicide Squad

1059,AB-Crawford,No love out there for DC,8,9 August 2016,"I'm not one who buys in to conspiracy theories. I'm really not. I'm not a ""fanboy."" I'm 42 years old and am still learning which characters belong to Marvel or DC. Having said that, I just find it really bizarre how the DC movies are getting destroyed by critics and Marvel is always highly regarded. Of the three big comic book movies this year: BvS, Civil War, and now Suicide Squad - I felt all three were close in quality and would have a hard time ranking them. So to see the brutal reviews for Suicide Squad, I felt it was time to write another review. The movie is well paced with great action scenes. The characters aren't especially deep and the acting isn't that great but are adequate. Harley Quinn is the only character who I felt they really put effort into and works quite well. The Joker is good enough. They were wise to re-imagine the Joker after Ledger's performance and death. It was better to go in a new direction than try to recreate his performance. I especially enjoyed the introduction of each character with their background and abilities. Though the relationship between Flag and Moone/Enchantress felt hollow. Overall, I had a good time with it. I just can't fathom how it sits at 26% on Rotten Tomatoes. That's ridiculous.",Suicide Squad
1060,rkhalid,Definitely not as bad as you think,7,20 August 2016,"I admit when I first heard the reviews for this movie they were pretty dire but when I watched it myself I really do not see what was so bad about it. The action was perfectly fine, character development was unique and the humour and romance was kept to a substantial level. The only things I would complain about and is probably the reason so many people rated this movie low is that the Joker was hardly there. He was pretty useless to the plot which was disappointing. Also it was a bit too supernatural for an action movie I felt and rather awkward to watch for religious people. However all in all it was a brilliant film which deserves an 8.",Suicide Squad
1061,JackInColumbia,Officer Amanda Waller to guarantee the safety of the US forms a team which includes the most dangerous villains of the world...,4,29 August 2016,"(1,5/5) What really counted for me was the time from the beginning of the movie until the time the team was ready for the mission because of the nicely presented villains and the flashback scenes. Robbie's performance was by far the one that stole the show for me. Apart from these, there aren't many things to mention... The idea of the film was good but it comes down to the usual and predictable ''super-hero- movie'' plot, action which was not bad but with nothing special either, some poorly and some awkwardly developed characters (except maybe from Harley, Deadshot and Amanda), a disappointing Joker (not Leto's fault) and boring villains( i mean the witch and her brother)...Just a bit above average for me, but maybe still fun to watch!",Suicide Squad
1062,fissorevincent,It's... an interesting lesson in failing.,4,10 August 2016,"After a year's worth of trailers, after months of teasing on the storyline, characters and general vibe and with a heightened sense of expectation after that dog's dinner that was B vs. S, Suicide Squad comes out in the heat of Summer, with a relatively clear August to bust box-office records and run amuck in theaters worldwide. After that pleasing introduction of the climate in which this movie was released, now comes the verdict: how does it hold up to its premise, and how does it fare in general? Sadly, not that well. Putting aside the mashup of a plot, which does not really know when to be either serious or funny (something its obvious inspiration, Guardians of the Galaxy, was able to do with a sense of gusto), there is a major problem with the casting and its general layout:-First and foremost, the Headshot/Will Smith-Harley Quinn/Margot Robbie duo, though with some chemistry, has been placed front and center in the movie, and it is depressing to say that they cannot hold it. Placing Smith in the obligation to play the role of a ruthless assassin cum well meaning but challenged father was a ballsy move, most specifically when the ""ruthless assassin"" part is skimmed-through and the father part is overplayed to try and get some emotions from the public. -Robbie, on the other hand, has been given the role of a manic/submissive bomb of debauchery, and needless to say, she nails that role, though with a sense of abandon that can verge on the careless. Oh, and let's thank Warner for reminding us that this duo had their own movie beforehand, a little thing called ""Focus"". -And as for the rest of the crew? It is a mixed bag, and no one really gets the glory of a breakout performance. Joel Kinnaman does a decent job as Rick Flagg, although too decent to really make a mark, Jai Courtney can be funny here and there, Viola Davis, as Amanda Weller, could be considered as one of the only really good performances of the movie, but it seems to be done with such boredom that we can only see a sense of it being phoned in. As for the rest of the Squad? Absolutely forgettable. Even El Diablo, though backed-up with an interesting backstory, does not really deliver. -Last but not least, the two most mesmerizing performances of the movie: Jared Leto as a downtrodden, coked-up, kitschy Joker, with no psychological depth or clearly fleshed-out motives, and no real place in the movie, since he is not the antagonist. Oh no. This is left to the other mesmerizing performance of the movie: Cara Delevingne. Yes, SHE is the villain (something called Enchantress). In the first part of the movie, she goes from your typical shy scientist to summoning the evil spirit she discovered in some lost jungle somewhere and changing into the otherworldly figure (in a half-assed allusion to Jekyll and Hyde). Then, after possessing the heart of the spirit which had been under the possession of Weller (for some reason), she transforms into something that could only be described as a porno version of a Greek goddess, complete with sensual dancing that would do a killing if accompanied with a suitable porn soundtrack, but not in a superhero movie with an epic score. On top of having the ocular expression of a dead fish, she does not manage the shift from shy and quaint to frightening and progressively camps her performance up to becoming simply hilarious. As for the rest of the movie, nothing can be salvaged. The pacing is wrong, the music is forgettable, some story elements have been shamelessly pumped from other movies (going through a building to save/eliminate elements residing at the top of it? ""The Raid"" demands an apology) and a general sense of being forced to compromise in order to fast-track the DCEU. In short, a COMPLETE mess.",Suicide Squad
1063,paladin-70605,I couldn't actually spoil this film :P,3,14 October 2016,"I am usually a fan of super hero films. Certainly, the recent Dead Pool was excellent (Marvel). But, I am thinking that Marvel is winning the whole super hero flick war. For instance, Avengers series with significant spin offs and surprises have had solid character development, of course, amazing special effects, just all around great films (not one from the past three years rates under an 8 out of 10 in my book, and I am picky). What is going on with DC? Why are they putting this poorly written crap in our laps? I must say, Batman v. Superman was pretty bad. Very poorly written stories, unbelievable rationales, poor character development and, yes, this film was more of the same but EVEN worse. It is an evolution of a team yet no one will understand why they start calling themselves, ""family"". Not much evidence to lead us down the loyalty path. The wonderful thing about Marvel is that their writers are just plain leaps and bounds better than these DC debacles - they make the unbelievable, believable. DC writers seem to make the believable, unbelievable which is basically cancer to super hero flicks I say save your money - an A list actor like Will Smith was not even able to save this one.",Suicide Squad

That was my experience with Suicide Squad in general. I am a huge DC fan and would be first to admit that the DCEU has struggled critically so far due either over ambitious plot (i.e BvS) or stupid endings (i.e Man of Steel Metropolis Battle), however in the case of SS the main problem with this movie was studio interference after the critical backlash of Batman V Superman. In terms of overall quality, the movie felt chopped up and poorly edited (again). Anyone who saw the trailers can tell A LOT was cut out for unknown reasons and DC executives deserve to smacked in the face for been so stupid and not trusting their director's vision. In terms of entertainment value, this movie had a lot of ""fun"" moments. Will Smith as Deadshot was great, Margot Robbie knocked her part out of the park, and Jared Leto had a very unique take on the Joker. His Joker is easily the most ""sane"" Joker ever seen on screen because Joker in this universe seems very in control of his actions even though he is still very unpredictable. This Joker is flashy and runs a ""business"", so he is the direct opposite of Heath Ledger's Joker, who just seemed to loved chaos. Speaking of tone, DC executives clearly got scared of keeping their universe ""dark"" and went the ""Marvel"" route of jokes mixed with action, which I personally didn't mind at all even though I am not a fan of ""marvel humour"". The original script of SS was clearly darker, but the studio wanted SS to become DC's ""Guardian of The Galaxy"", which is STUPID. Overall, I loved this messy movie for what it was. I will never defend this movie as a great summer flick, but I would say it is just as dumb as the critically acclaimed Marvel flicks critics seem to love. Go watch it for yourselves and make up your own goddamn mind. My score remains 10/10, which is a VERY subjective score and not to be taken too seriously.",Suicide Squad
1066,mvanekadhi,Great,10,14 September 2016,I still do not understand all these reviews basically trashing this movie. Was it perfect? No it was not but was it a great comic book movie that stayed true to the source material? Yes. I had a great time watching this movie and to give it a horrible review you either aren't a comic book fan or just wanted to do it because it wasn't the dark knight. Although I do think the joker should have been in it a lot more. Having said that I know there are going to be the people who cry and say that the joker isn't part of the suicide squad. That is correct however you cannot have Harley without joker and doing an intro to all of the characters to leave the joker out would be a sin. They should have left the deleted scenes with the joker and other characters as well in the final cut but nothing we can do. Soundtrack was great and so was the acting. You people who are nitpicking this movie go home and continue picking your butt hole because it's obviously the thing you are better at than watching movies and understanding them.

I love the dark feeling in the DC movies so far, and i got a lot of darkness in this movie. The movie had the dark and funny feeling. The jokes were hilarious and the characters were amazing. I love Jared Leto's joker. A very good new take on the character. The gangster look he had looked very good on him. I wish we got to see more of him. I thought this movie was very good, but yet again the critics bash another DC movie. Please go out and watch this movie. Its a lot of fun and very entertaining. The characters were very fun and some were funny. Deadshots back story was very well done and emotional. by far my favorite characters are Joker and Captain Boomerang. That camio was pretty sweet too. Made me excited for Justice League",Suicide Squad

The only good part about this movie was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Ultimately, the movie was a mess. Story as similar to dirt and except Margot and Will, everyone were crap. Jared was good as Joker but he was not given enough screen time to prove that he can come close to the level Heath set as Joker in The Dark Knight. Direction was good and so was the background score but the bad story ruined it all. Margot and Will were the only one who tried to lift the movie with their acting chops but the bad story again ruined it here. I would recommend to watch it for once only if you have patience to watch whatever crap the producers are trying to make you see in the name of Superhero genre movie.

1069,richard-62034,2 hours of Fun,8,9 October 2016,"Why don't people just enjoy a movie anymore? A long time ago people made movies that gave the average person 2 hours of timeout. No one cared if the CGI wasn't perfect, or that the bad guys makeup was too generic (see Star Wars episode IV or Doctor Who). They saw the movie and took 2 hours away from reality to relax. Now everyone wants to bang on about how character development wasn't up to their standard, blah, blah, blah!Lighten up guys!This movie is a great way to enjoy a Saturday night. It has subtle humour, pink unicorns and witches who want to take over the World. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto steal every scene. Jared Leto is no Heath Ledger as the Joker (but no one will ever portray this character like Heath Ledger) but he is excellent in this movie and makes me feel like there HAS to be a spin off movie for the Joker and Harley. Margot Robbie continues her stunning rise and is the real star of this movie, her quips making each scene more enjoyable while making fun of her fellow squad members and herself alike.Will Smith plays the same character he has played since the Fresh Prince. Anyone who watches a movie featuring Will Smith and not expecting to see this has been in a coma for the last 20 years.All in, if you want to watch this movie with a preconception that it is groundbreaking or significant in any way, DON'T! This movie is a ride along of fun, shooting, fantastic makeup and wardrobe and for the guys there is Margot Robbie in the tightest hot pants! Do yourselves a favor, rent or buy this movie for a Saturday night, grab some popcorn and some beers and just enjoy a movie that has everything you need in a comic movie, plus Will Smith.",Suicide Squad
1070,omearadarragh,This movie literally scarred me....,1,16 February 2018,"I used to love super hero movies... Everything changed the day I walked into that movie theatre to watch what is undoubtedly the worst thing I've ever seen. I can't even call it a movie. Movies have plots... Movies are entertaining... Even bad ones get a wee little laugh for being so bad. This is even beyond that. The whole point of the film makes no sense... A room full of generals shoots down Waller's idea to set them up then, in a effort to convince them, she uses a witch to steal military secrets from Iran. This apparently proves enough cause to set up the squad, instead of just using the witch on her own to steal whatever secrets anybody wamts. The real jewel, this witch is seemingly under the control of whoever has her heart but not really because she just breaks free with ease when Waller falls asleep. Then surprise surprise, the squad this witch was supposed to be a part of ends up having to take her down. The coolest scene in the movie should've been deadshot busting the shite out of all those walking caviar blobs with cool camera angles following bullets as they split 4 things open at once, instead it's about 2 minutes of Will Smith standing N a car shadow boxing. Joker drives a Lambo and wears loads of bling. Completely wrong character motivation, and just like the film, that's enough about him. Too stupid (not funny) jokes, trying to rival Marvel. Would've been way better if it was gritty and dark like the trailers led us to believe. There's just so many terrible things. 1 star is too high. I'm permanently scarred. I've only been to the movies twice since and both of those times were in the last month. This movie is so bad it genuinely damaged my love of film. I can't even count Howard times I said ""What the fuck!?"" in the theatre. Just God forsaken tripe....",Suicide Squad
1071,sudeerasj,The only villain in here is the movie itself,2,2 June 2017,"It's only the 3rd movie in the cinematic universe and DC has found a new low. Instead of trying to remove the heat created by the controversial responses to their previous movie with a proper live- action adaptation of Green Lantern or any other iconic superhero, They chose to do this. A movie about assembling a team of super villains to stop another super villain from destroying the humanity. This does sound interesting until you actually watch the movie and realise that if the US government really wanted to save the humanity, all they had to do was to NOT assemble this team.In a world where batman, wonder woman and flash already exists, the only way to protect the country is the Suicide Squad. An all villain/anti-hero team consisting of a marksman, a girl with a baseball bat, a guy with a boomerang, a guy who can shoot fire from his bare hands and transform into a giant fire monster, a Japanese lady with a sword,a guy who can climb anything(Seriously ? this guy ?), a half man-half crocodile person and a witch awakened by probably the world worst archaeologist ever. Yup. They totally doesn't match with each other or to stop any actual threat. but the director tries really hard to convince us otherwise by having them fight faceless CGI creatures that poses no threat to even Harley Quinn or capt. Boomerang of all people. The fights are poorly executed and doesn't have any real stakes. there is absolutely nothing to make us feel that we should care about these characters either. They just get together, go to some place, take down all the CGI creatures, move to another place, take down all the CGI creatures and keep doing that until they find the big bad guy and defeat him in on of the most dullest final battles in film history. That's it. there's nothing good to be taken from this movie except the great performances by Will smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis that aren't enough to save this movie.",Suicide Squad

It basically had no plot line, no structure at all. I can't believe this movie actually is rated 15+ in our country (between pg-13 and R), and I don't think it fits. It has violence but very dull and not exciting violence. We didn't get to know the characters (I know many of us probably knew them from before) but many of us didn't know about them before. Got really disappointed and won't be seeing it again. According to me it's not worth the time and it's like superhero movies for kids, although the audience clearly isn't for children and they failed on that. It's not exciting enough for older people. 12 year old's can see this because there's no graphic or scary violence which I thought.",Suicide Squad

1075,slowcloud,What's with these ratings? This is an exasperatingly bad movie,2,3 August 2016,"I don't get the ratings here. This is a cut and dry poorly made movie and fans of the DC universe deserve better. I don't normally post my reviews here. But I have to share my take on this movie because it just wasn't good. I didn't even have to go into spoilers to show how terrible it is. Movie goers shouldn't mindlessly consume these films. Christopher Nolan set a high bar, but producers and studios need to step messing with auteurs and maybe we can get a quality DC movie:There is nothing in Suicide Squad that shows any hope that an auteur filmmaker can do anything distinctive with the current cash cow of the Hollywood machine: the super hero movie. What Christopher Nolan once made his own has devolved into a predictable pastiche whose charms should be wearing thin on audiences. It doesn't help that the movie is also an example of how bad one of these films can be when it becomes watered down and designed to refrain from shaking up anything in the so-called DC Universe. Suicide Squad, a PG-13 film, was supposed to be DC's entry to rival Marvel's R-rated Deadpool. Even though Deadpool had its own problems as a self-aware action movie, it still had focus and a bravado that is nowhere to be found in Suicide Squad.Suicide Squad follows a group of villains with super powers released from prison as part of a government plan to protect the world from terrorists or whatever sign-of-the-times fear currently plaguing society (Zika?). Starring Will Smith as the hit man Deadshot and Margot Robbie as the Joker's manic girlfriend Harley Quinn, alongside several other less familiar DC baddies, these guys are supposed to be complex people who have long fallen from grace and are supposed to rise above to find their humanity and gain the audience's sympathy. But writer-director David Ayer tries so hard to take a safe route, you can see the gears trying to manipulate audience emotion, revealing the inherit problems of these comic book adaptations straining to catch up with decades of printed storytelling.You can't totally blame Ayer, who last gave moviegoers Fury, an incredibly strong and startling war movie featuring a better fleshed out motley crew of characters. The preciousness Hollywood has for its ongoing world building of interconnected comic book films creates such tight restrictions on storytelling that anything that might upset that world has no room to prosper. At one point, toward the end of Suicide Squad, one character asks another, ""Shouldn't you be dead?"" Of course not, this is the DC universe, and it's gotta be milked. That means no major players should be written off in one movie.The result of these storytelling restraints is a soulless kind of filmmaking hampered by pussyfooting. It's like a syrupy glaze that drowns out any possibility to shine above what has become a predictable pattern of storytelling. Characters dole out uninspired lines that play superficially to feelings, like, ""Dad, I know you do bad things, but I still love you."" Then there are the clichés, like ""fight fire with fire."" Sometimes the script inadvertently deflates the tension by spelling things out. Someone over a radio says, ""Use extreme caution,"" and someone in the action responds, ""I don't like this."" But in case you miss that, someone else says, ""I don't like it either."" A kid playing with his action figures can come up with better chatter to establish tension....",Suicide Squad

No one in this movie looks like they care, no one is giving anything of quality at all.Every single moment of this film is painful, I will be using this 'disasterpiece' to torture enemies of the state.

A very expensive and flashy mess.",Suicide Squad
1078,Teymur4,Worst movie ever.,1,26 April 2021,"I watched Suicide Squad (2016) and it was the worst movie I have ever seen. There were jokes every 2 seconds which weren't even funny I chuckled at 2 of them. For the whole movie we don't know the villains motives. The Joker and Harley Quinn actually have a stable relationship which the whole point of there relationship is Joker is supposed to not care for Harley and just use her. 1 character was just used to be killed off and 2 other characters were there for no reason the contributed nothing. This one character was not interesting but was there for most of the movie. Jared Leto's Joker performance is really weird and stupid. Most of the movie is boring. The only good part was all the songs put in it. The movie is all around crap, worst movie ever. I rate it 0.5/10.",Suicide Squad
1079,Mesina02,Suicide Squad is a massive problem,2,9 August 2021,"When I saw this film for the first time, I thought it was okay but today I consider this to be one of the worst superhero films of all time. There are so many elements in this film that do not work at all. The first 20 minutes really prove how bad the movie is and almost every scene feels unwarranted.It was really hard for me to like any of the characters because their scenes as the film goes along do not have any depth to it. The pacing as well is really poor and I'm surprised because superhero films do not usually have pacing issues because it's fast-paced action but this one really felt slow.The many problems that Suicide Squad has goes way deeper than I thought. There were production issues and the studio had to reshoot a huge portion of the film and when I first got news of this, I immediately understood why this movie felt way off. It's a bad film and watching this will just waste 2 and half hours of your day.",Suicide Squad
1080,thegoldfishpool,"Not Bad, Not Great, But Good Enough",7,7 August 2016,"K, here it goes. I liked it, I didn't love it. It's a 6.5/10 for me so I'll round it up to 7. Technology wise, the CGI was pretty bad on the Brother, he looked like an orange Electro from ASM2. I get that they didn't have very much time for character development, so they tried the Guardians of the Galaxy thing and do character development through music, which became messy. It worked in Guardians because they were using different songs to develop one character so there was a continuity of style. Here they attempted one song per character and there were so many characters it felt disjointed. I really like the graphic intros to the characters but I felt either you do them all or none of them. I wanted to see the Slipknot and Katana little baseball card thing. Enchantress needed more clear motivation, she was such a generic ""I want to destroy everything and rule the world!!"" Character with no passion behind her. It would have been more interesting if she were making this a purely personal attack on Waller. That would have been easily done. I do miss the concept that I originally saw where enchantress' machine was opening a wormhole for Parademons. I liked all the performances, I liked Joker much better than I thought I would. Harley was great, except for the bar scene where she fell flat, something about her delivery just didn't work there. I like that they didn't make Croc a stupid brute. He was intelligent and funny. I even liked Jai Courtney, I hate him in general as an actor, here he was pretty good. Deadshot, wasn't bad enough. I wanted him to be more of a cold blooded killer. The best character with the most depth and a great subtle nuanced performance was El Diablo. Jay Hernandez was fantastic in the role, he was the most real out of all of the cast. Viola Davis was bad-ass, as always. Rick Flagg was just American Soldier template #23 I really didn't feel he had any reason to even be there. The batman stuff was cool and the flash scene was a nice surprise. Overall I had fun, it was a definite improvement on BVS, it's not bad, it's not great it's good, and that's good enough for me.",Suicide Squad

I was waiting until the movie finished. This film had a whole lot of bad, and not many good things. Lets discuss why the film doesn't work. First, the setup was awful. Viola Davis wanted to get the suicide squad together before the threat occurred, didn't work for the plot unfortunately. The action scenes we're boring, the lighting was so low I could barely see what was happening. Diablo's character's mini plot was destroyed once he used his powers too early on, you can't develop him after that so why try. The backstories were OK, but didn't effect the audience, at least for me. And the ending was the biggest downfall. No one celebrates the suicide squad. I can't even cheer for the heroes after they save the world, Than what am I suppose to be happy about?, I thought this was suppose to be a fun movie, nothing happened that made me feel like I was having fun.",Suicide Squad

What Nolan did with Batman trilogy was just brilliant but after watching Dawn of Justice and suicide Squad, it seems that they're gonna ruin the whole franchise.After BvS, I had some hopes with Suicide Squad but this movie is a complete disaster. No story at all, Pathetic dialogues, Bad acting, and above all the joker played by Jared Leto, even Jesse gave a better psychopath touch to his Lex Luthor character in BvS. As a fan, I'm highly disappointed.",Suicide Squad

1085,savage1250,An overly hyped film and a very unfortunate disappointment,6,13 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the number one problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such in coherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent in developing these characters for their introduction to the big stage. Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at some points. But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and a great villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn't make sense because the movie itself went in so many directions that none of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a total failure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls so flat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster. This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority of the casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. I really think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast would be Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of Rick Flag was out of touch of what that character should be and for Enchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should have been chosen over Cara Delevingne. The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better movie than Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. A weak six stars and a onetime watch.",Suicide Squad
1086,kejbra,Finally a good DC movie,8,10 August 2016,"I just watched this movie today and I must say its a very good movie. I had some minor issues with the movie, like the lack of a theme, and some illogical short scenes but nothing important. The action is good, the editing is good, the movie is not to dark. Its NOT a Zack Snyder movie, and the art and action style kind of reminded me of Watchmen from time to time. This deserves a 7 star rating, however I gave it 8 for ""saving"" the DC movies and bringing its fans good entertainment. Its a better movie than the Zack Snyder superman movies and better than the amazing spiderman 2. Its worth your time and money.Watch it!",Suicide Squad
1087,Joe_Crisan,Tries to Be Too Much,4,6 August 2016,"First, let me say I'm not a DC Comics reader. That said, I was interested in seeing this movie, because Watchmen, although I was not familiar with the graphic novels, is my #2 favorite movie of all time after Casablanca - so you never know.Now, I have followed the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, which took about 10 years to build to what it is today (over several movies and TV shows), and obviously DC Comics is feeling the pressure and needs to come up with their own as quick as possible. So, they have the Superman movie, BvS, and now Suicide Squad. Here's the problem: DC is trying to make an entire universe with just these 3 movies, and it shows. The film starts out with the background of several of the characters, and takes up almost the entire first hour doing so. This is a fun show, propelled forward with a great soundtrack of pop songs, old and new.Then, the group is brought together to rescue an unnamed High-Value Target after some terrorist activity in the city. This is where the plot actually begins. They hop on a chopper, the soundtrack suddenly changes to just a score, and the helicopter crashes (it's in the commercial). In total there will be 3 helicopter crashes, but an hour into a movie, I should be caring about what happens to at least some of these characters. Since I don't read the comics, I don't have the already ""built in"" care that other viewers may, but this says something about the story itself and how it's failed to capture the viewer's interest. Also, there's a really silly thing that made me laugh out loud in a crowded theater: every time the Enchantress entered or left the screen, there was a woman whispering ""Enchantress"" like some perfume commercial. It's ridiculous.There's also a character who dies, and I knew it already because that character is the only one who didn't get the full treatment with a background scene. They also threw in some lady with a silly mask (named Katana), who has 1 line and 1 move in the entire movie, so I'm not sure what the point was in having her in there.Then, somewhere in between there, I guess the director / producers realized they needed a love component (or at least friendship type of love) and made a really awkward display between two people who had literally just met about an hour before when they got on the helicopter! The HVT was not a shocker at all, although the characters all seemed shocked, so I think the viewer was supposed to be, also. Confusion.Throw in some awkwardly-placed, forced one-liners, and suddenly the movie turns into the final scene of Ghostbusters for the last 20 minutes, with a whirlwind of smoke and lightning, and a witch in a skimpy dress dancing in the middle the whole time. I was waiting for Stay Puft, but he never came. The plot was so forced and weak, I wonder what the production meetings were like. Add in the weird (not artistic!) use of the soundtrack, poor character development, silly mistakes (The Diablo's tattoos change as regularly as Harley Quinn's accent Overall, this movie was a cluster of things that made it feel like they crammed a bunch of elements to create an entire universe in a single movie. And I have to say it failed at that. They could easily have introduced some of these characters in shows like Gotham or Flash, or in movies like Batman, Superman, or BvS. Then they wouldn't have to crunch in so much background stuff and could've actually had a great movie, but this failed in so many ways I think (sadly) the DC Cinematic Universe is doomed.",Suicide Squad

1089,lucashammar,It was actually very good. I enjoyed it!,7,3 August 2016,"So after a decent start with a pretty good but not so amazing ""Man of Steel"", and a disappointing follow up with the terrible ""Batman v Superman"", comes the third movie of DC Extended Universe. Suicide Squad!From the guy who brought you ""Fury"", David Ayer delivers an action packed, entertaining movie with a lot of interesting characters, dark humour, decent CGI effects, and fast pacing. Maybe it wasn't the best DC movie I've ever seen, but it's a lot more better than ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman v Superman"" combined.This is the good things of the movie: The casting is excellent! The introduction of the main characters was well performed. Will Smith is doing great at being cool as usual. I was kinda worried that Jared Leto as The Joker would turn out to be silly and not so accurate. But thankfully he did a very great job. It was like a more nutty version of Heath Ledger's portrayal from ""The Dark Knight"". Margot Robbie was probably the best choice to play Harley Quinn. She was creepy, psychopathic, and crazy, but at the same time sweet and hilarious, and a lot more interesting than she usually was in the comics and the TV shows. Joel Kinnaman, Viola Davis, and Jai Courtney were also pretty good, but maybe not so amazingly great.This is the bad things of the movie: The main villain is just so uninteresting, forgettable, and boring. I actually thought it was gonna be The Joker. But nope. Instead we have a dark supernatural demon that wants to take over the world for no interesting purpose at all. The 3D was okay at some moments but at the most it was just unnecessary and bland. The characters should have had a lot more back stories. But I guess we got enough, we will probably see more in the sequels.If you want to see it, go watch it. You will probably not be disappointed. I can tell you that I think this is the best movie so far in the DC Extended Universe.",Suicide Squad
1090,landingwiz,Losing My Faith In DC,5,5 August 2016,"I was face-palming throughout the entire movie:The first thing each ""hero"" does when he makes his first appearance is to punch a cop or soldier just to show how badass he is. Really??Killer Croc is basically portrayed as a green version of ""The Thing"".The way they tried to use different old soundtracks for each scene, you knew they were trying to imitate ""Guardians of the Galaxy"".This joker is a joker. Nothing more than a wannabe gangster, instead of a psycho.Amanda Waller behaves like she is possessed by a demon. What's up with that?Enchantress talks in a holy Galadriel-like manner, but then suddenly blurts out, ""You don't have the BALLS to do this"". Wtf?I could go on and on about how cringe-worthy and sloppy this movie is, but I'll leave it at that.The only saving grace is Will Smith and Margot Robbie. But even they were not enough to save this potential-wasting, sloppily-edited, ultra-forgettable movie.As a DC fan, I hate to say this, but DC desperately needs directors like Christopher Nolan to bring glory back to its Universe, or it'll just continue to be overshadowed by Marvel.",Suicide Squad
1091,NightWatchers,Suicide Squad was a fun movie with a messy way of telling the storyline,7,6 August 2016,"First of all, this movie does not deserve the reviews they have been getting from the critics. I mean 27% ?! That's too harsh to judge on a decent comic book film. Yes there are some flaws, but throughout the entire movie, it was very fun. These characters are just hilarious and they crack up jokes throughout the entire movie. Margot Robbie was brilliant as Harley Quinn, Will Smith was fun and spectacular as Deadshot, and Jai Courtney was actually really funny as Captain Boomerang. Also, Jared Leto was also good as the Joker, although I prefer Heath Ledger's by a mile. Not only the performances from these people, but the story was not bad (except for the villain). The story gave them backgrounds and show the viewers who these characters are and I thought Deadshot's flashback was the best because it shows his love for his family, which brings to one of the best scene of the movie including Batman. Finally, the action sequence were mostly great, and the soundtrack of this movie are just brilliant. Although the movie was fun, the telling of the story was not good. It was a mess. The Joker was there (who we originally thought was the main villain), and the suicide squad itself, the flashbacks, the main villain Enchantress, and scenes with Batman and one of the justice league characters. It was too much to be shown into one entire movie. The Joker did not have to be in that movie, as well as Batman. But these are the things people want to see so they did put them in the movie. And WOW ! Enchantress was horrifying in this film. She was half stripper half evil... I don't even know. And Killer Croc was just useless. After all, the overall storyline of Suicide Squad was good, but because the writer includes these people who just do not fit in the movie, it makes the telling messy and cramped together. But hey, I had fun. It was certainly better than BvS in my opinion. This movie gets a C+.",Suicide Squad
1092,donovan2419,Suicide Squad is evil terrible,1,10 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is evil terrible.  It's a glorification of brutal loss of morals by all parties, done in depressing dark colors, dirty textures and non stop ugly brutality. If folks are rating it 75, we are in serious trouble.  I think the studios are stuffing the comment boxes big time.This movie is not just terrible.  It's evil, it's an evil vision, it's an evil experience, it's just plain evil. I had to come home and watch Age of Ultron to clear my mind and soul.  Wow, the contrast was universes apart.  DC is promoting corruption, violence and evil, Marvel, even though it's an action movie with fights and deaths, is promoting love, caring and peace. The DC universe is dark and evil, so we have to be evil too. Parts of the Marvel universe are dark and evil, but not the majority of it. The Marvel heroes strive to stay good even when facing evil. The best DC universe version was the 2001-2006 Justice League and Justice League Unlimited cartoon series. Batman: the animated series 1992-1995 was pretty good too. This whole dirty gritty depressing version of the the DC universe has been tacked on by movie and TV directors, it has nothing to do with the comics, or the cartoons. It's contaminating some of the marvel TV shows too. I'm sick of it. It fetishizes evil.

Not bad, but not what I was hoping for. The introduction of a couple of the characters started the movie off strong, with a great soundtrack but these outshines the others, which I get, time restrictions and all. The action was good. Deadshot, Boomerang, Killer Croc, Katana, Harley Quinn, Joker all get their due, which was great to see. Diablo was a breakout character, and had some great sentimental, and action scenes. Enchantress was really well done, loved her transformations into June Moon. Viola Davis was amazing as Amanda Waller. The plot was pretty linear, and the villain was, well, was just there to move the plot along and something for the squad to fight. A lot of humor felt forced, or out of place. There are some truly good one liners not shown in the trailers, but most of them were, which I predicted. The joker was a side character, which was somewhat disappointing, however his scenes with Quinn are fun to watch, and I can't wait for his own movie, hopefully with her! Verdict: See in theaters(at a matinée).",Suicide Squad

The cast of bad guys suited up perfectly, but glooms in their light-toned characterizations.Star of the show Jared Leto's joker role made fans as well as movie-goers enthralled in the trailers, but coming to the scenario, his takeover was not distinct, despite joker's lady-love Harley Quinn shined the screen in every moment she steps in. Margot Robbie as harley was the film's main merit and makes us wants more of her titillating witty.Moreover, the film lacks in authentic narration which every fan expects, Director David Ayer's notion of storytelling was fine, but conveying lead roles past-present relating events, origins and the squad's team up events messed up & makes this an average superheroes gone wrong flick which shouldn't happen.",Suicide Squad

The story was very poorly written, you felt lost from time to time trying to keep up with what was happening. The characters were OK but harley quinn was pushed as being sexy rather then actually so concentrating on the character which they should have concentrated on. The action was OK but again was rushed and the climax to the movie was not good enough for a film that built it up so much All in all it was OK but people that go in with a open mind like me will feel it was nothing special, people with high anticipation for the film will feel very let down",Suicide Squad
1096,leeleechick,Meh. Didn't live up to the Hype.,5,6 August 2016,"All the cool factors like the hot casts, great comic book characters and pop culture went into the marketing for this film. For a year, we hung on to the breadcrumbs of snippets like the awesome trailers and Instagram posts from the casts. Then the movie finally comes out and it's just MEH...Just Okay. Not nearly as terrible as the critics say but it wasn't great as expected. The GOOD: Awesome Casts of Actors Interesting. Hardcore comic book characters each with their own personal origin storyThe BAD that made the movie mediocre:-CHEESY Final Fight Scene - The main villain, enchantress is a lot like Gozer in the 1984 Ghostbusters. A creepy ancient cult supernatural being that was worshipped with magical powers with the desire to rule the world. That was the 80's and it worked back then because it fit the cheesy style of the classic Ghostbusters comedy.But for Suicide Squad, it's more raw and edgy with DEADLY hardcore villains as the main characters. David Ayers could have picked a better enemy out of all the characters in the comic book world. That was lazy writing. If Cara's Enchantress knew what everyone wanted in their hearts, then how could she not predict or see Harley's motive to attack her with the sword. Clarity - There was a scene were Enchantress showed us what each character in the squad wanted in their hearts through a mental fantasy.Lame action scenes - The slave servants of Enchantress looked like a PILE OF Black Rocks or Gobs. They had no faces. They only existed to die to see the Suicide Squad in action. THE SQUAD NEEDED BETTER COMPETITION. The things were so dark you couldn't really see them and they were boring. Deadshot (Will Smith) was great though.A Lack of action. I think there was only like 1 or 2 fight parts before the final show down.If David Ayers had the Suicide Squad to fight against another team of comic book villains like Deathstroke or hundreds of other choices that were plotting to take government information or the cliché take over the world, this movie would have been way better. It would have been cool to see Lex Luthor in the mix betraying Amanda Waller or something.By the squad fighting other hardcore villains with abilities and known identities, we would see their different fighting skills and abilities better rather than them fighting faceless black gobs. So Suicide Squad was MEH. A WASTE of a great cast of actors and awesome comic book characters.I didn't care about Rick Flag's love motive with Cara's character. Cliché and corny! Rick's actions and stupid simpleton mistake thinking he can control an ancient demon supernatural being to get rid of the bomb was so stupid.Corny happy ending. Rick Flag gets his boring girl back.

Margot Robbie was the perfect choice to portray our favorite DC anti-hero. She's sexy, wacky, and capable of taking care of herself. Ignore the critics and watch the film in 3D this weekend. It may have a few flaws, but overall it's the perfect summer blockbuster. Be warned: The Joker isn't in the movie very much.

The beginning was promising as it introduces our heroes (villains*) and how they previously were put in prison, it gave me chills after briefly featuring The Flash and Batman, which, along with the good editing, was no match for the disappointing remainder of the film.My complaints overall: - Slipknot being introduced in several different articles and trailers before, only to be featured in the movie to be killed off for the purpose of scaring the Suicide Squad.Enchantress being the villain after being shown previously to be a member of the squad.Killer Croc probably had less than 5 lines in the whole movie.Deadshot hardly wore that awesome white mask of his.Harley Quinn did not change at all, and remained the same crazy character which appeared funny and interesting in the beginning-middle -ish parts of the movie, but soon died down.The middle of the movie.The end of the movie.The mutant creatures that were clearly easy enough to be killed by a wooden baseball bat.Enchantress as the second villain form.The brother, an ancient god, easy enough to be killed by a bomb.Rick Flag, the special ops trained soldier, easily dragged away by the mutant creatures as oppose to a woman with a wooden baseball bat.The Joker survived the helicopter crash/ jumping out from the helicopter, especially without any kind of visible wounds.Overall I am glad that I got to see the movie, and also glad that we had free tickets to see it.",Suicide Squad

This movie made BVS look like a classic. with the hype and cast this movie made, it deserved more!! I cant believe DC accepted this script and very very disappointing!!

The backstories of the characters were brief but overall well done. The action was very well-paced. The movie had an amazing soundtrack. In this film, the romances were well developed. I would have liked to see the extra parts of the movie that they had to cut because the movie did end up having less joker but the joker was not the main focus of the story.

This is inherently no ones fault, sometimes film makers can do everything right and the film still falls flat, the reason Suicide Squad isn't the masterpiece everyone thought it would be can be attributed to the fact that Warner Bros have no faith in their movies, while at the same time are rushing them out half baked.It's no secret that Suicide Squad featured heavy re-shoots and is rumoured to have around 25 deleted scenes, a decision made when Batman vs Superman began to receive the onslaught of negative reviews that now surround it. Not only this but Writer/director David Ayer wrote the script in just over three weeks. How ever despite this the movie manages to be a fun film, it has flaws yes but a lot of people seem to be blowing them way out of proportion.First things the first, the first half hour to 45 minutes of the movie are a hot mess. The editing is choppy, the pacing is all over the place and the less said about how the soundtrack fits in the better. The film bombards you with information on all the characters in such a way that you just feel overwhelmed. Some of the intros work well such as Deadshot's and Captain Boomerang's, however other characters like Killer Croc seem over and done with before you even know who they are. Sometimes it's the opposite, too much time is spent on one character when we already know all we need to. Most of the supposed deleted scenes are apparently from this part of the film and I think if they included these scenes or spent a little more time on polishing it could have been a fine introduction to the characters.Despite this the movie picks up after the team has been assembled, and thanks to good dialogue and a lot of chemistry between the actors the movie becomes a lot more entertaining. Action scenes are fun and engaging and while I do think a higher age rating would have benefited them they are still enjoyable to watch. All characters have a role to play with the exception of Katana who really doesn't bring anything to the film as a whole, she is by no means badly acted just unnecessary when time spent on her could have been spent on the other characters. Will Smith and Margot Robbie give it their all with Deadshot and Harley Quinn and their friendship is so refreshing to see on screen. Jai Courtney even brings the funny with Captain Boomerang and is a great addition to the ensemble. However the stand out is Jay Hernandez as Diablo who quite literally brings a fiery passion to his character and his story is the most interesting to see unfold as the movie progresses.Of course the film still has a few minor flaws such as generic villains (well villains of our villains) and certain mishaps in direction and writing. This could possibly be attributed to the fact the movie was rushed or just David Ayer trying to do something different, but these don't make the film unwatchable by any means. I do believe that if the other DC movies weren't as bad as they are people wouldn't have been so hard on Suicide Squad but that is not the case. In the end it's by no means a bad film but with the opening being as jarring as it is and the other minor flaws dotted around DC falls short of the bar yet again. However I do think that if the film does get an extended cut we will see a more clean and thought out version of the Squad, not like the underwhelming, so called ""ultimate cut"" of Batman vs Superman"" For now it's just a fun and silly action movie.I will say this: oh boy does it get you excited for a Batman solo outing...",Suicide Squad

It's a waste of time and money and they don't deserve anymore than what they've already received. There has been a lot of curiosity of what Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker would be, and I must tell you that it is without a doubt the worst Joker portrayal of all time. He is only in the movie for a brief amount of time and thank god because every second he was on that screen was pure and utter agony. He technically played a character called The Joker but what i saw was in no shape or form The Joker. Will smith doesn't play dead shot, he plays will smith. Harley Quinn hardly even speaks like Harley Quinn. If your looking for a bright spot in this movie, don't worry, there isn't one. This movie encapsulates everything that's wrong with studio films nowadays. Cater to the young audience who isn't even a fan of the source material. This movie was made to sell Halloween costumes and merchandise. That is all. Try again DC, cause Marvel is kicking your ass.",Suicide Squad

DC fails of trying to do the marvel formula of we are heroes lets fight the bad guy yeah. instead of doing a very very interesting movie about the villains they are not good guys,Suicide Squad
1107,moelsawy,Neither here nor there,6,5 August 2016,"OK so here's my non-spoiler Suicide Squad review. After reading a lot of the negative reviews, I told myself I would not let my excitement die down, especially being a DC fan. I would go and form my own opinion and hope to prove the critics wrong like with BvS. Unfortunately I can't really do that! I won't go as far as to say that the movie is the 'worst of the worst' as one critic has said. But I won't say it was great either, it was somewhere in-between, a 6/10 from me! I really wanted to enjoy it, I thought the animated movie, Assault on Arkham was great and that they would follow that sort of storyline, with some bits taken from the Batman: Arkham games. But what we got was an incoherent storyline, with plot holes, poor editing and a Killer Croc that was more 'Tame Croc' than Killer. After watching it, I really wished it was a 15 rating. When you have a group of villains, who pretty much assassinate and brutally murder people for a living, and replace the violence with forced jokes and music, you end up with an all-over-the place movie that doesn't deliver. The main take-away from the movie was the acting... I loved the portrayal of Joker by Jared Leto, which is probably the closest to the comics I've seen (minus the tats and clothing). And Margot Robbie's Harley at times, I was like 'woah, this is really Harley', she did a great job. Amanda Waller was really good minus the unnecessary joke scene. Deadshot was pretty much Will Smith being Will Smith aka Hancock. El Diablo was actually really good, one of the better characters of the movie, probably because they didn't force any jokes on his character. Enchantress was quite good I thought, at least to begin with. Captain Boomerang was a laugh, which you expect from the character. And the rest were just okay. I really expected more from the movie and it could have been so much more, but it fell short, because they wanted to Marvel-ise it and make it funny to please the masses. In doing so, they alienated their true fans and made a movie with no heart, just wasted talent.",Suicide Squad
1108,vsalmy,"Nowhere near the level of the greatness of the Dawn of Justice. Brings more jokes, though.",7,5 August 2016,"Yes, I love Batman V Superman (both cuts, with the Ultimate one being superior), and I have to say that this is the weakest link in the establishing DCEU so far.The Editing. Quite funny, considering if done right, you don't even notice the editing in the final product. However, anytime it's bad - it's noticeable. And boy, bad editing stands out in this one. It makes a few sequences look really out of place, like shoehorned in. Whoever did the job needs to seriously punished.Lack of the Joker. Seriously, you hired an Oscar-winning guy to play the Clown prince of crime, basically were promoting entire film with him... aaand you cut out maybe 50 % of his scenes. Seriously, the hell is wrong with you, WB? Leto as Joker was fine, I think, based on those few scenes we got, but the exact lack of those didn't convince me that he is better than late Ledger. Which is unfortunate, because I was looking forward to Leto becoming the final Joker. This is essentially my biggest gripe - not enough of Joker. When I think about it, he is pretty much pointless to the ...""plot"" of the film. Makes no impact, whatsoever.The plot. It was going to be simple, sure. I mean, so was Mad max Fury Road and look good that one turned out to be. BvS was aiming for greatness, and say what you want about it, it reached the epic of the clash of the World's finest. Suicide Squad? Basically makes fun of itself, which is NOT the way to go. First half is the actual team-up process, with all the origins stories, setting up and introducing each member. Other half is trying desperately to catch up to the rest of the story and offers very little suspension. There are a lot of plot devices just to make the story moving forward, and that's cheap. Don't get me started on the final fight between the Squad and the main villain - it was retarded. Like, Marvel-level retarded. The Antagonist. Haven't delivered, not one bit. You see all that build-up, expositions of how damn strong he/she is, showing off all them sweet powers and abilities, rendering the villain almost Superman-level OP. His/her plan is silly, with no real reasons to do that, it just happens, and you kinda go with it, because the film itself is entertaining, but.. that just ain't enough.Some members of the Skwad. are beyond useless and out of place. The one is there only just to serve as a comedic relief, another one is wasted in like first 5 minutes after the team is deployed into action (I know it's in the cannon, but this is a film - act like you give a damn), and some other that is seriously underused and looks like he is there just to do that one thing the plot requires in order for the Skwad to succeed.The Music. I was afraid this would be an issue, and I called it. The whole film made an impression of a 2-hour MTV music-video-mash-up. It was refreshing for the first 40 minutes, but then it keeps on going and going, playing another tune after another, with no particular need, it's just there to ""lighten-up"" the mood of the film - I call bullshit. On the other hand, the movie made a damn good job of making me guess all of the classic hits from the past, so props for that!Batman cameos. You are going to see Batman from a different perspective, they said. You will get to experience the fear and thrill the bad guys experience when they see The Bat show up, they said. None of that happens. You get regular ""Batman interacting with the bad guys"" sequences, that do NOT stand out. Another wasted potential.The pluses are: visuals - those are top-notch (obivously, Mr. Snyder was involved as an exec. producer)Deadshot, Harley, Joker (given the screen time he had..), Amanda Waller (you are going to hate her.. A LOT. Makes Nick Fury from the friendly Marvel neighbor look like one-eyed tooth-fairy), El Diablo (surprisingly enough, he is the MVP during the last 30 minutes), soundtrack (good choice of tracks and spot-on timing) and that's pretty much it.Final thoughts. It is obvious that for some reason, this film turned out to compete with the Guardians of the Galaxy instead of being full-scaled dark action thriller with formidable Bad Guy, bad-ass team that gets stuff done, supervillains acting like..you know, supervillains (not some wanna-be heroes they ARE NOT), and an occasional one-liner here and there for the healthy laugh. Instead we got the DCEU version of GoTG with far more music and far less chemistry. I still liked this film, took it for what it was. It just didn't deliver. The entire mid-credit scene was somewhat good, but at the same time unnecessary. Bottom Line: Batman V Superman remains on the top of the DCEU (and entire comic-book films genre for me) food chain. Here's hoping that Patty Jenkin's ""Wonder Woman"" will be better (which for now seems like will happen) and that the Justice League will be the best comic book film ever made, finally topping The Dark Knight.Interesting fact: Zack Snyder directed Flash's cameo scene in this film - one of the good parts of the Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad
1109,duncanbourne,Harley Quinn! Harely Quinn! The only name you need,6,16 August 2016,"I wanted to like this film, an insane mix of DC's bad guys & gals, throw in a new Joker. What's not to like? Well quite a lot actually, which I will come to, but then I gave it 6 stars. Why would I give a film I was unimpressed with an above average score? In a word Margot Robbie (aka Harley Quinn). Quite simply she makes the film (with a little support from Jared Leto's Joker). She's mad as a box of gun totting frogs and utterly at home with that (aside from one forgivable dream sequence). It is hard not to like her cheery psychotic disposition, which takes a battering but is never broken. In so many films where you have a ""strong"" female lead they are there to endure great hardship or to out bloke the blokes. And while it is true that Harley Quinn shares a blokey love of violence really she is just out to have (twisted) fun. In this she has a lot more in common with Tank Girl (the comic not the film) than he co-female characters (Amanda Waller, Enchantress, Katana) who are all, well, a bit serious. I could have watched an entire film featuring just Harley Quinn and Joker and given it a resounding 10 but, alas, it was not to be. So what was wrong? Well to be honest although the premise was good(ish) and Cara Delevingne's Enchantress a great tragic villain, and Viola Davis gave a good performance as Amanda Waller, and Jared Leto was fascinating as the Joker..in the end the whole was just a bit too clichéd. There was nothing at all sympathetic about the ""good guys"". We had sadistic prison guards (yawn), troubled soldier Rick Flag with a tangled love interest (ho hum) and endless fight scenes against anonymous attackers which were just like any other mass fight scene ever filmed. CGI was OK but nothing special these days. Will Smith's Deadshot was a positively pedestrian ""bad-guy-with-heart-of –gold"", single parent assassin with teen daughter whom he adores. Adam Beach's Slipknot might just as well have worn a red star trek jumper. As for the rest they were either one dimensional caricatures or just blended into the back ground. I tell a lie, Jay Hernandez did a good, if clichéd, performance as Diablo. It could have been so much more. I raise a glass to Robbie, she may be slight but she must have damn good muscles 'cause she carried the whole film. And finally who in their right mind would think it a good idea to give unstable psychotics guns and expect them to behave? I mean seriously?",Suicide Squad
1110,Kevin_C1,"Sadly, the best DC has to offer",6,5 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is yet another disappointing entry into the DC Cinematic Universe. Unlike its predecessors, Suicide Squad is exciting although it suffers from a wonky storyline, cheesy dialogue, and a lack of direction.The first thing that you will notice about this movie is that Deadshot (Will Smith) is the main character. The first shot is of him, the most time is spent on his backstory, and he appears first in pretty much every possible way. This is both a good and a bad thing. I am not a fan of changing the source material to accommodate for a big Hollywood name. It seems like Deadshot will have a large part to play going forward in future movies. The bright side of this is that Will Smith kills it in this movie. He makes the assassin very likable, and more importantly, hilarious.Harley Quinn shares the spot light as well, and Margot Robbie does a great job with the character. She is funny and her acrobatics make for the most fun fighting sequences. Unfortunately, paired with Robbie's Quinn, is Leto's Joker, which may be the worst part of this film. The Joker is not scary, disturbing, or creepy instead he leaves you feeling second hand embarrassment for Leto. Also, in an attempt to show you how crazy The Joker really is, effects are used on multiple of his scenes. The production is crap, and it just looks tacky. The Joker in this movie is a major disappoint, in comparison to any other Joker that I have ever seen.Although both Will and Margot do a great job, it is still a disappointment that other members of the team do not get more screen time. Killer croc, Boomerang, and Diablo all had potential to be great additions to the cast, but are barely given time to develop. Their introductions last a fraction of the time that Deadshot's and Quinn's do. They have their moments later on, but are never given a real chance to develop. It seems like they are just there to fill in the blank space and make jokes. Towards the end of the movie, Diablo plays a much bigger part, but because he was never fleshed out as a character, it comes off as very forced and out of nowhere. Katana appears later on to help control the villains, but she is completely forgettable, and completely non-essential to the plot. Slipknot makes an appearance out of nowhere and with no explanation, just to be made an example of to the rest of the squad.The plot to the movie is very convoluted and random. The action starts quick and out of nowhere. All of a sudden the task force that everyone was against, is now up and ready for action. The plot is often moved forward by the characters stupid decisions or by things that just don't make any sense. Why was Amanda Waller's (Viola Davis) building crawling with the enchantresses minion? Why did they allow Waller to leave on her own helicopter with no superhuman protection? How did they allow Deadshot to find top-secret information all alone in the wreckage of the helicopter? Why did Flagg bring the letters from Deadshot's daughter on mission? The same joke is also constantly used over and over. The punch line is always the same being, ""We are bad guys."" It gets old very quickly. Another card that DC has already overplayed in just three movies is the death fake-out. With the Joker fake out in this movie combined with Superman's inevitable return, it is just lazy writing. Overall, Suicide Squad misses the mark on it's ""dark"" and ""disturbed"" target. The film comes off as pretentious and messy. The film is a fun popcorn flick, but flops when it comes to having any meaning or heart. Suicide Squad is another stumble for DC as they try to catch up to super hero flick giant Marvel.",Suicide Squad
1111,pablospersonal,Erm........,5,8 September 2016,"I have waited with pure anticipation for this movie, like a child waiting for Kit-kat after visiting the dentist. As a self-confessed comic book nerd, every movie that hits the screen containing a Marvel or DC character(s) - I am there. So, since the news was spread over the old t'interweb that Suicide Squad was to be made, I drooled like a Lion eying up a cow. I was expecting the movie to be a guardian of all that is good, brave and ass belting about super hero and super villain movies. I was rather disappointed! I was left feeling like the movie had never actually started, like it was stuck behind a tractor in a 70mph zone. The plot was weaker than a bridge made of wafers - the only thing that made it appealing was the fact that people spoke words. The plot felt like it was thrown in there as a side project to the huge cast and special effects. I can't even be bothered explaining the story because I don't want to waste 3 and a half more minutes of my life that I will never get back. The cast gave the movie some presence, however they were massively under used. Will Smith was good as Deadshot, however the moment he touched the screen he seemed suffocated. Almost like he wasn't allowed to bring his natural humour and energy to the project. Jai Courtney was good, as was Joel Kinamann. They all seemed a little under staged by the moronic plot line though. Margot Robbie was the pick of the bunch as Harley Quinn. She was beautiful, dangerous and desperately annoying - all the qualities needed to play Ms. Quinn. She stole the screen every time she appeared - I reverted to being 12 again, as a crush quickly developed, only to be thumped numerous times by my wife, in the arm. It was Harley Quinn's movie in all reality. The sub plot line involving her and the Joker could easily have been made into a movie of it's own. Jared Leto was terribly mis-cast as the Joker. Unfortunately I think we have all been spoiled by a certain Mr. Nicholson and the Late Heath Ledger. They encapsulated both old and new versions of the green haired psycho. Jared was painful to watch as he over-acted his way through much of his scenes. Over acting is not a bad thing in this role, but Jared just did not pull it off. Unfortunately for him, Ben Afflecks 34 second appearance as Batman was a finer visual treat than the majority of his contribution. Affleck is a good Batman.The script came straight from the George Lucas School of film writing, it really wasn't the best. In fact had they paid more attention to the character development and allowed the actors to breathe a little more, we would have been in for a wicked treat. The one liners were few and far between and there was a distinct lack of flowing energy. Overall the pulse of the movie was slow - the special effects were fabulous. That is a major positive, the costumes were on a par with superb and the setting was dark and mysterious. But the film did little to make you want more. It did little to grab you by the preverbials and thrust you into ""dark"" Gotham. The Anti- hero's need a better script to shine. It is not the worst film I have ever seen and I am glad I viewed it at the cinema. I really hope a sequel will do Suicide Squad more justice.",Suicide Squad
1112,hcarljohan,"Tonedeaf, joyless and above all boring",2,31 August 2016,"Suicide Squad had some genuinely brilliant trailers and looked like it was gonna be the first movie in the DCEU that actually knew what exactly it wanted to be. I was absolutely convinced that this movie was going to make me sigh in relief that there might actually be hope for DC's new movie universe. Instead it was by far the worst movie in said universe thus far. The thing is while Batman V Superman was a mess and made absolutely no sense it at least had a few big wow moments. Suicide Squad doesn't even have that to offer it's just a monotonous bore from start to finish. The first third is pretty much nothing except for a huge exposition dump. Rather than naturally learning who each character in this team is throughout the course of the movie, David Ayer thought it was a brilliant idea to waterboard the audience with forced flashbacks that strive not only to give us the facts about them but also try to get us emotionally attached to them. I can't believe Ayer is so stupid that he doesn't know you can't expect an audience to care about a bunch of characters just because we are told to. It's literally like: ""OK, Deadshot has a daughter who he loves, Harley Quinn was very tragically twisted and tortured by the Joker and Rick Flag fell in love with this scientist lady but she is possessed now. OK attachment out of the way let's get started!"" Not to mention it's just boring watching 5 elongated flashback sequences back-to-back. The worst character out of the bunch though is the villain. This one actually manages to make even the worst of the Marvel villains look like Heath Ledger's Joker. Not a word that comes out of her mouth is interesting and her evil plan is as clichéd and tiresome as evil plans get. Oh and if you were planning on seeing this because of the Joker, don't hold your breath. Leto's baffling performance is original and new in all the wrong ways. He strays so far he loses any semblance of actually playing the Joker and instead feels like some drugged up, gang lord pimp who is neither scary nor entertaining. However the worst thing of all is that you just can't have fun with this movie. There's a clear attempt to ape Guardians of the Galaxy's success with similar soundtrack choices as well as frequent jokes and bombastic action sequences. This attempt falls flat on it's face though seeing as the music is awkward and out of place, the action scenes are repetitive and unimaginative and the funniest jokes in the movie barely even manage a chuckle. I will give credit to some of the actors though, in particular I think Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller are ideal choices. And every now and again this movie does manage to do something entertaining which is why I am bumping the score up a bit but overall those moments are so rare it doesn't matter in the long run. A bad movie which I couldn't have seen coming in a million years. Lots of potential for solid and fun entertainment wasted.",Suicide Squad
1113,kolbytrosclair,One of the best comedy/action/sci fi films of the 2016 year,10,9 August 2016,"The movie is really, really amazing I've been waiting for this movie to be released since February.

I could tell he didn't because no so much you know what, explosions. But anyway I do say this is one of the best films of the 2016 year and better than any other combination. we should've seen more of the Joker, he is a type of person to be crazy and do suicide things, but with Jared Letos performance it is pretty good. It was really amazing and nice to bring Harley Quinn, into the live screen action I mean she should have her own movie.

However, I decided to give it a second chance and I watched it last night and for some odd reason I really loved it. I think this is a very fun, dark, intense masterpiece. Is the editing a little choppy? Yes it is, but it honestly isn't bad at all! I actually think the Joker is in the movie enough also. The character development honestly isn't that poor. The only character that the development was poor for was probably Katana, but she was actually really cool in the film! My favorite characters in the film were: Harley Quinn, Deadshot, El Diablo, and Amanda Waller. All four of those were the best/strongest parts of the film in my opinion. My only negatives for this film are the weak story and poor villain. Enchantress is still a terrible villain. WHY DOES SHE LOOK LIKE SHE IS HULA DANCING?! One of my favorite things about this film is the soundtrack. I actually love how they played music in the film. It is one of the reasons the movie is so much fun! I also love how much depth the characters have. Especially in the bar scene. I almost cried when Diablo was talking about what happened to his family and when Deadshot found out about his daughter writing to him. I think the movie has a lot of heart and depth. I like how they portray these people that did really bad things like humans. The characters are still definitely human. Overall, I really love this film and I think it is super under-appreciated. Not the best comic book film ever, but definitely in my top 20. I give the movie a 9.5/10! You should definitely watch it.",Suicide Squad

The film is written and directed by David Ayer (""End of Watch""---Which I loved---And ""Fury""). The film stars an array of talented actors playing some of DC's most iconic super villains ever. GOOD: -Harley Quinn. -Deadshot. -Pacing. -David Ayer's writing and directing (Each movie he does is different). -All of the cast in general. -The FUN, FUN, FUNNY vibe that is required for this movie. -Action. -Visuals. -The animated introductions to characters and animated credits. -Batman cameo. -The Flash cameo (played by Ezra Miller). -The soundtrack fits the movies vibe. The soundtrack is just good anyway. -Introductions to all characters. -Ending. -I had a strong connection with the characters. Whether they were happy or sad. -Batman and The Flash (briefly) viewed as villains than rather good guys. I even felt they were kinda like villains. OKAY: -Joker. -Joker's sub - plot. -Villian. BAD: -False advertising with footage. -False advertising for The Joker.OVERALL: This is a good superhero film that is fun and evil (in a good way). I'm for sure buying the 13 minute extended cut on Blu-Ray when it comes out. I recommend it... Even if you hate DC. RATING: 8 out of 10. SCORES: 16/21 Good things. 3/21 Okay things. 2/21 Bad things.NOTE: Don't listen to the critics. Or Marvel fans. Watch the movie and make your own opinion. Don't jump on the ""I HATE IT!!!""

She was GREAT but Meryl Streep couldn't even pull a good Harley out of this script.Will Smith and Viola Davis, however were allowed to shine which is weird 'cause I just mentioned how this movie was racist and sexist AF. There are moments with them that are so good it's INFURIATING because it makes you wonder where the heck they came from and why the whole movie isn't like this. Shoot why isn't the whole DC Universe like this? You have Amanda Waller out here KILLIN IT meanwhile you have Killer Croc and how all his lines seem to have been added in post the way they don't really fit and the way he's always the only character on screen when he talks. And the scene where they first introduce Enchantress was super creepy and cool but by the end she just makes out with people to turn them into power rangers putties and does that...wiggle thing. there are so many inconsistencies in every aspect of this movie. I'm so frustrated.I'm really trying not to go off and go over EVERYTHING and it's hard. There's just so much that was wrong and so many little tweaks that could have fixed it.And like, Beware the Batman (RIP gone too soon) made me fall in love with Katana as a character and they just.

Jai Courtenay, yes I know, inexplicably he is the best thing in the movie. Margot Robbie is wasted as Harley. Diablo could of been cool if his character was given any room to grow or not be jam packed with clichésThe Bad. The restThe worst. The talented cast being utterly wasted on this steaming burlap sack of dog turdsThe beyond worst. Cara Delevingne, how in the name of Stanley Kubrick does this women land movie roles?!?

1125,fgaughen-93802,Not as bad as most people may realize!!!,4,14 August 2020,"Suicide Squad wasn't horrible but it has it's flaws. Lt's start with the good stuff because there is a lot of good stuff in here believe it or not. Let's talk about the flashback scenes. Both of them I thought were very good. In the first one with Harley Quinn and Joker I thought was very well done with Joker psychologically tormenting Harley and she end up falling in love with him. At first I loved Jared Leto's Joker I thought he was really good but we'll talk about him later. I loved the scenes with Joker denying Harley I thought they were really good. Next let's talk about the flash back scene with Deadshot. I thought it was really good. His daughter came between her and Batman. Basically Batman was about to take Deadshot in and he had a chance to shoot Batman but his daughter stepped in front of Batman and he had a choice to do it in front of his daughter or set the right example, and in the end the police captured him hugging his daughter handcuffed to a fence. I thought that was really heartbreaking and good. Well that was the only good things to talk about now let's move on to the bad stuff. Lets talk about the plot first it was pretty bad and seemed very Marvelish. Basically this witch is reaking havoc on a city and this team is sent out there to stop her called the suicide squad. Keep in mind the Justice League was formed already while this was going on. Couldn't they have just called them, no the call a guy who can shoot things and a girl with a bat and a giant crocodile. Now let's talk about character development, they only develop two characters, Deadshot and Harley Quinn they never think to develop any more character. There are some really good ones, for instance Killer Croc who suffered a skin disease and people treated him like a monster so he acted like a monster. There is some really good potential for character development but no he is the big strong guy of the team. Now lets talk about what everyone is talking about in this movie. Jared Leto as the joker. Is absolutely horrible. Everyone he talks to it seems like he wants to assault them and not by hitting them or punching them. His laugh sounds like he's having an asthma attack. In the trailer it seemed like he was going to be the villain which I would have liked. But he's not its this witch. What they should have done is sent them to go fight with this terrorist group or something because that is what they did in the comics. All in all this is not a very good movie but if your a massive fan then maybe you will have some fun.",Suicide Squad
1126,stormrider65,I'm Sorry But I Just Have To Write Something,1,18 August 2017,"After a year of storing the downloaded copy of this movie, I finally watched it today (19/08/2017).And yes: I JUST HAVE TO WRITE SOMETHING TO RELEASE MY PENT-UP FRUSTRATION OF WASTING MY TIME ON THIS PIECE OF DC GARBAGE.First and foremost, let's just say that we ALL know we are watching a sci-fi movie. So the enemies are also gonna be out-of-this-world. But, really? Are they? Oh yes, sure they do, starting with the 'Enchantress', who is supposedly to be 'attached' to one lady and can emerge ONLY when being called upon. On top of that, she can literally teleport, going anywhere as she wishes.As the show progresses, we are told that the female controller 'Waller' has her heart, and she can actually 'control' the Enchantress by...doing things to it (?). So why did the Enchantress NOT teleport to her heart, grab it and go, LIKE WHAT SHE DID IN THE SHOW EVENTUALLY? We are not told. Just some random scene of Waller telling her history, and the next thing we know, the Enchantress had gotten her heart back.Then we have one legion of enemy army who are nothing else but 'humans' wearing faceless masks, running all over the place just to get beaten, smashed, slashed, shot and killed by this 'awesome' Suicide Squad. How scary was that? Very NOT scary at all.And how do this 'army' get to be so faceless and 'out-of-this-world'? By having the Enchantress KISSING - that's right, you read that correctly and clearly - every captured soldier and turning them into that faceless army. Well, talk about 'oral hygiene', notwithstanding bad breath, decay tooth and whatnots! Then, we are reminded once and again by that woman 'Waller' to be 'very careful/ be caution' of this army, JUST TO HAVE THEM ACTING TOTALLY HUMAN-LIKE, WITH ABSOLUTELY Z.E.R.O. EXTRAORDINARY POWER. They, albeit the masks, ARE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN ARMY! LOL So how 'very dangerous' and 'very deadly' are they exactly? Z_I_L_C_H danger.Then the Joker appeared with a stolen helicopter that had his man shooting Waller and her Squad company. That totally irritating Harley simply stood up, all in the midst of gun-firing, to jump into the arms of her lover Joker - SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE RECEIVED HIS MESSAGE VIA HER HANDPHONE.And when the helicopter went down, she actually MADE HER WAY BACK TO THE SQUAD, WITH THE WHOLE TEAM HAVING NO EXPRESSION, AND EVERYONE JUST WENT ON AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. JEEEZZZZ...W.T.F WAS THE SCRIPTWRITER THINKING? HIS MOTHER'S PANTIES PERHAPS WHEN PENNING THE SCRIPT? After a good useless 1.5 hours of talking and acting as if the Squad is very powerful, we are shown to have the finale - the Squad squaring off the Enchantress and her brother, whom the latter despite getting shot at by every available firearm from the Squad and experiencing no effect, ACTUALLY GOT KILLED BY A BOMB. Yes, a bomb. So bullets = no effect. But bomb = yes, killed.And what do we have for Enchantress? Nothing, but just PLAIN ARMED-COMBAT + CLOSE-RANGE FIGHT. Yes, a WITCH who has ""completed her powers"", actually goes into an armed, close-range hand combat with the Squad. How fantastically...retarded that is? VERY retardy, I must say.Of course, all baddies got killed in the end, with the Squad acting as if they really don't care and give a f*ck.But I really got to pen it down here: Suicide Squad, just like Man of Steel, IS ONE BIG GARBAGE THAT IS PROBABLY WRITTEN BY SOME LOW-IQ FELLAS WHO THINK THEY ARE 'SOMEBODY', BUT IN ACTUAL FACT, A RETARD IN REAL LIFE. Man of Steel had the same old sh!t - Superman can bash, kick, slap, ram, punch, and do all other stuff to his nemesis Zod, with ZERO effect. But at the end of the show, how did he kill Zod? That's right - by engaging in a close-range, unarmed combat that had Zod's neck twisted. Just that simple. Suicide Squad's Enchantress is so powerful, yet engaged in a close-range, armed combat, and again with a simple slash to her chest, GOT THE SHOW ENDED. Lazy script-writing? Absolutely? DC sh!tty production? 100% certainly.Conclusion: do not spend any more money on DC sh!t. Just follow what I did: waited for their cr@p to come out and fade away, download their torrent and show, watch it, AND DELETE IT FROM YOUR COMP DRIVE COMPLETELY. Their shows and productions do NOT deserve a spot even in my storage.",Suicide Squad

1128,gemini0577,Colorful and darkly decent fare,7,7 August 2016,"It isn't a great film but it does a good job of fixing the things Batman vs Superman got wrong, namely bringing in a bit of humor. The film doesn't take itself too seriously but seriously enough that it nestles neatly into the franchise DC is building. It's well cast with both Margot Robbie and Viola Davis chewing the scenery with grand extravagance. Jared Leto, donning the Joker mantle this time around, does a fantastic job even though it is ultimately the outlandish appearance of the character that cheapens his performance greatly. The special effects are mostly excellent but there are a few points where it is clearly CGI (not really a bad thing). Perhaps the most glaring flaw is the villains central to the plot. The collection of squad members, save for Smith's Deadshot, seems to be a mish mash thrown together with no genuine thought. The antagonist is also vastly underdeveloped though still entertaining.",Suicide Squad

1130,fred-m-stabs,Not a Marvel movie,7,13 August 2016,"I just saw Suicide Squad last night, expecting it to be terrible, but loved it. In fact, all of my friends really liked it. In fact, I heard more than a few strangers leaving the theater talking about how it was not nearly as terrible as the reviews. The movie was certainly not perfect, and some critics did point out its real flaws, but if comic book cannon and plot holes don't flip you out then you can really enjoy watching it. Seriously, the perception you get from Rotten Tomatoes does not match reality at all.I won't repeat what many other reviews here have already stated, but overall this is a really fun movie to see, despite the usual flaws. It is more adult, not because of any sex or violence, but because immature audiences wouldn't get the drama or ideas in the movie. I'm not saying it was great drama nor was it deep or complicated, just compared to other shallow cartoon-depth superhero movies. The action scenes were poorly filmed and not very fun, and while my 11 year old daughter loved it, I can easily see this going over the heads of most kids. The plot is not always clear, but that's not really the point or what you could be enjoying about the movie.I am not a comic book reader and have zero concern for the whole Marvel versus DC arguments; I only watch movies for their value as entertaining films. I absolutely loved Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel) and thought BvS (DC) was a confusing mess of a story. However, there is a clear trend with who loves or hates which comic book movies, usually mapping to DC vs Marvel. People who like (and apparently need) the traditional concept of unrealistically-good heroes and unrealistically-evil villains will like Marvel movies. MoS, BvS, and Suicide Squad all touched on concepts from Watchmen – the very antithesis to the superhero concept. In Suicide Squad we are supposed to cheer for the exact same people that were portrayed as the evil villains in the first X-Men film: a government group whose purpose is to counter otherwise unstoppable superheroes. I'm not talking about who is a ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"", I'm talking about the concept of who watches the watchmen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes). I thought Avengers Civil War was going to approach this topic, until the lame Iron Man-Spiderman drivel about extreme power *not* corrupting someone.If you are a die-hard comic book reader who expects to see the typical hero defeating evil story then you will not like Suicide Squad. If you liked reading Watchmen (the book, NOT the movie) then you might like it. If you worship the concept of superheroes or liked any X-Men movie then you will hate this movie. If you are a Marvel devotee, then...why are you even reading this? Your mind was already made up long ago.",Suicide Squad
1131,stonej666,Fantastic Movie,10,8 August 2016,"This film is truly one hell of a fun and entertaining experience. The opening 15 minutes gave me goose bumps while seeing the origin story/introduction to the squad members. The fight/action sequences are spectacular and would stand up against any modern war movie, mirroring the skills David Ayer displayed in Fury. The story is easy to follow and explains well why people make the decisions they do (something that was missing in BVS) The actors were brilliant in their portrayal of the characters, mostly impersonating their New 52 comic book version, with subtle references to older versions. Will Smith and Margot Robbie were by far the stand out performers, Jai Courtney was a very funny Captain Boomerang and i found Joel Kinnaman to play a good Rick Flagg, a character who you have to like as they are a good guy, but is never really liked by the others. The integration with the rest of the DC universe was good, and one thing that people might not realize is that this film is really a sequel to BVS, and you really need to have seen that for this film to make complete sense. There was enough humor in the film to get a few laugh out loud moments but i would have liked more captain boomerang. So far this has been my favorite movie of 2016, which is something when you consider we have had Deadpool, Civil War and X-Men Apocalypse. I would recommend this film to anybody that likes fun, fast paced action movies, with humerus elements. Its not just a comic book movie, but if you are a comic book fan then i'm sure you will love this as much as me.",Suicide Squad
1132,paulmccomas,"Harley, Deadshot, & Viola Davis Keep It from Sucking",7,5 August 2016,"""Suicide Squad"" is a good movie that could have been much better.The script needed work. There were too many members of The Squad ... & they killed off *the wrong one* near the outset! But Harley Quinn and Deadshot both worked well. Viola Davis has total bad-ass gravitas. Not a bad Joker ... though Heath's shadow will always loom large over whoever essays that role (more on this later). I liked some elements of Enchantress.The action sequences were, predictably, WAY too uber-rapid-cut-cut-cut; when there are fights (or dancing) in a movie, I wanna see the freakin' *choreography*, which requires shots of greater length -- even with a camera that's in motion. God, I'm SO SICK of the MTV-on-steroids, blink-and-you-miss-4-shots clichéd editing that once (like, 30-plus YEARS ago) was experimental & adrenaline boosting but now is a lazy-ass way to produce excitement where none otherwise would exist. (Don't get me started on how editing & cinematography destroyed Lara Croft. TOTAL missed opp.) If Alfonso Cuaron had directed this (which he should & could & well might have; hell, it's better source material than ""Hellboy""), with a better script (one that delves into the psycho-socio-cultural/neo-feminist subtext -- and/or the socio-political subtext, as ""The Dark Knight"" did) -- now, THERE's a movie.OK, so: Mista J. (-sigh-) After Ledger died, I said, ""Retire this character. Hang his jersey up on the wall, & call it a day, 'cause no one will ever touch this."" I thought Leto did as good a job as anyone could of following in those footsteps -- without downright mimicry, which likewise wouldn't have worked. Talk about a thankless job! Like I said: ""Not a bad Joker."" But not a very-good one, either. We had ONE. ONCE. In ONE masterpiece of a movie. Time to go re-watch (again!) TDK.My nephew Henry Darrow McComas has mentioned ""Escape from New York"" in connection with SS, which is spooky, 'cause last nite, in its best, tensest moments, SS was giving me total ""Escape..."" vibes, as bad guys whom we're rootin' for are stalkin' the mean nite-time streets of a demolished Big Apple, w/ WORSE baddies right around the corner. John Carpenter should have directed! Henry also mentioned the -- SPOILER ALERT! -- unlikelihood of an iPhone app doing-in super-meta-humans. Agreed. Kinda like the use of -- ""STAR TREK: BEYOND"" SPOILER ALERT! -- ""Sabotage"" over radio waves during the climax of the (otherwise largely fine) new Trek film.In view of Margot Robbie's performance, I hold out high hopes for the upcoming Harley Quinn movie. (And I'll be there for the imminent Wonder Woman re-boot, that's for sure; been carrying a flame for HER since I was 14!) See ""SS,"" & judge it for yourself.",Suicide Squad

At no point did it wane at all, and at just over 2 hours was timed perfectly; unlike some recent 3+ hour epic superhero movies I didn't get bored.Effects / CG, were obviously good.The bad:The plot was so bland it was almost none existent. I'm sure in a week I won't be able to recall it at all. I get that this is made for a broad audience of varying age and intellect. I'm no rocket scientist myself, but at least give me a little something to think about.Harley Quinn was the biggest let down. I was expecting her character to be deep, dark and troubled by her demons. Instead we saw a comic version of this, where she just came off as a little quirky.The joker was 'meh'. Jared Leto has some big shoes to fill, because of course we're going to draw comparisons to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson. But this Joker lacked the depth and personality of the other 2. I understand his screen time was limited, so hopefully in future movies this will be expanded on. The bad guy was just a generic bad guy, created for the sole purpose of giving the heroes something to fight. A villain's character should have depth with character and/or a back story that allows the audience into the mind of said bad guy. There was virtually no character development at all.To sum up; considering the premise of super-villains / anti heroes vs super-villains, this movie was bland and lacked character.",Suicide Squad

1138,rodjohaness,Walk to the building the movie,7,10 August 2016,"After the death of Superman, the world has become more aware, for better or worse, of the existence of metahumans and their potential threat to society. In case another powerful being shows up that doesn't exactly stands by Superman's moral code, the U.S. government wants to be prepared. This is why Officer Amanda Waller teams up a bunch of the best/worse criminals and forces them into a special ops mission in order to protect the world from evils even greater than themselves. Can Amanda trust the city's safety into a team of dangerous delinquents or will they try to turn against the government and run for their freedom?Suicide Squad is the 3rd movie in the current DCEU, directed by David Ayer and his vision of what an anti-hero DC movie looks like. As a casual superhero fan, I don't have much background knowledge on the Squad. So this movie overtime became an opportunity to learn more about the more the more obscure DC characters that the mainstream audience may ignore. When the movie was initially announced, it seemed to be another dark and gritty entry in the DC movie series, but sometime after the BvS backlash and the success of Deadpool there was word that some scenes were re-shot to make the movie ""more fun"". Whatever that means. Now I didn't want to make much of it at the time, but then the marketing for this movie shifted into what I like to call ""unicorn puke"" level of color and imagery. I had concerns about it as it seemed that they were forcing to make this movie seem 'funner' than it actually was. How did that turn out?Let's begin with the good stuff. I absolutely loved the characters, specially Amanda, The Joker, Harley Quinn in all her annoying punch line glory, Will Sm.. I mean Deadshot, Enchantress, El Diablo I do think this movie's characters are very appealing and the cast certainly played their roles respectfully. I would love to see more of them in the future. Also the idea of an anti-hero team fighting a greater evil is pretty cool because that makes their motivations a lot more sensitive rather than just ""doing what's right"". The beginning scenes and the final battle were pretty exciting and loved every second of those. The cameos from the Justice League members were glorious. I admit I felt a sense of comfort and hype whenever Batffleck showed up in the movie. It really made this movie feel like a bridge to even greater things from the DC camp. I am from the crowd that does love the epicness Zack Snyder has brought to DC, so even though this movie was probably never meant to be as ambitious, I still had high standards for it. So that being said, there were things about it that certainly felt rough. Around the middle of the film particularly the pace is extremely slow, and I blame this on the fact that they started having deep conversations about the characters yet they spent very little time letting us get familiar enough with these characters. Their origin stories were literally reduced to a montage of 1 minute snippets each. It would have still been nice to have some extra context to them so we could relate more when the middle drama happened. Also, this made the movie feel like a 1 hour long ""walk towards the building"" scene were the only threat were putty-patrol looking baddies. The icing to the raw cake was that the ""forced fun"" was very blatant with the random mainstream songs shoved into the scenes and the non-funny cliché one-liners thrown almost every minute.Suicide Squad is a decent entry in the DCEU that while not my favorite, I still found enjoyable enough to celebrate and talk about. It does indeed help expand the lore of the DCEU and makes a better case for the Justice League than BvS did. Now after this movie we know how far society would go to embrace both the best side and the worse side of the metahumans war. It is a nice diversion until we get the upcoming more epic entries in this film series.",Suicide Squad

It's as lazy, plodding, predictable and improbable as Batman V Superman, although slightly more entertaining.Margot Robbie is an actress with a lot of natural screen presence, but it was squandered in her over-the-top kittenish performance. We get no real look into her thoughts or motivations, just her ""crazy act.""And Will Smith, arrrrrgh! It's like he has an al a carte menu for acting. One wisecrack, check. One in-your-face staredown, check. One ""slap dat bitch ona ass,"" check. He just Will Smiths around, only it's not cute anymore. Totally phoned it in.Jared Leto's Joker was very good, but has the same problem as all super villains who kill off their henchmen with abandon: who would work for this guy? Only El Diablo had even rudimentary character development, everyone else was forgettable, and there were too damn many of them! The movie starts off on the wrong foot, with painfully inept exposition. There are no likable characters. The plot is completely inbred and circular--the problem the Squad is trying to solve would not exist if not for the Squad, and when they achieve their target and find out who they have rescued, their disappointment is equal to the viewers'. The super villains want to rule or destroy the world, whatever. It's all clichés from start to finish. Then at the end they try to pass the Squad off as some kind of zany family that just needed a chance to prove themselves, as if they weren't mostly homicidal maniacs. The GGI overwhelms what story there is, and it's the dirty gray CGI of ten years ago. There is nothing original about the character design or sets, and all the action is in a depopulated city at night. Worst of all, the movie doesn't address its own premise. The Avengers did a masterful job of showing how different levels of beings, from skilled human to enhanced human to super being, might interact. Suicide Squad attempts the same thing, but blows it. Every character seems capable of surviving things like fiery helicopter crashes, although the pilots invariably die. It's not even clear what powers some of these guys have--the movie has to go out of its way to give Killer Croc a job to do--swimming--to help the team. ""What if Superman became a terrorist?"" asks one character. ""Who would stop him?"" Apparently, the answer is a guy with a lot of guns, a crazy chick in F--- Me hot pants, and a chubby guy who throws boomerangs.",Suicide Squad

I was completely enthralled with everything: the acting, the camaraderie, the music, the special effects and the costumes. Everything the Avengers had in their first movie, but lost somewhere along the line. The Suicide Squad returned to humor and wit; which is why we all read comic books in the first place.

Excellent choices for cast and crew - Thank you!For the Music? WOW, I don't think I have heard a better sound score and honestly, I thought I would pick and choose thru the explicit pieces, but I could not.

1142,thejamaicancritic,Twisted and Therapeutic-The Risk That Paid Off,10,4 August 2016,"David Ayers's Suicide Squad (2016) is twisted as it is therapeutic. Colourful, comedic, dramatic, dark, violent, avant-garde and thrilling are a few choice adjectives to describe Ayers's work of art which reaches into the mind of the viewer.The film is fun and uncanny, running under the guise of the average comic book narrative but is deceptively deep. It plays on emotions and breaks the viewer down scene by scene. A psycho-analysis, a psychosis or a connection, I don't know what it is, but Suicide Squad is therapeutic on many levels. These are bad guys, villains of the worst kind, but you can't help but sympathize with them, understand them and later to identify with them. Admit it or not, Suicide Squad reflects the outcast in all of us.The thirteen-member ensemble is highly impact-ful and superbly cast. Jared Leto delivers a skillful performance as the joker, comparable and on par with his heavy-weight predecessors such as Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight, 2008)) and Jack Nicholson (Batman, 1989). This is matched and complimented by his bravado, psychotic, stylish and scene-stealing girl-friend, Harley-Quinn, played to a tee by the talented Aussie native, Margot Robbie. Of notable mention is Jai Courtney as the dead- pan humorous and bank-robbing kleptomaniac, Captain Boomerang, whose role though restricted, is effortlessly charismatic and emotionally poignant. Also noteworthy is new comer Jay Hernandez as the reformed arsonist and human flame-thrower ""El Diablo"". A comic book film with not only an emotional hook, but an emotional canvas.

I enjoyed this and was generally fun but just pootered out leaving me feel kind of disappointed. All in all I was good. For me Margot Robbie did a fine job as Harley Quinn, Will Smith was so so and was basically the character out of I am Legend but with a costume. Jared Leto WAS indeed pretty damn good as Joker but little screen time - what you see in the trailers is pretty much what you get, give or take a few more seconds. Also didn't feel he really needed to be in it at all as his scenes seemed to be thrown in for hype value and didn't really pack a punch or follow the story. I feel he was only in it for bums on seats as non Batman/Squad/DC fans wouldn't know many of the other ""Villains"" if not any unless they read the comics or have played the Arkham games. For me there was a wasted opportunity for a ""WOW"" movie and fizzled into mediocre by the end, HOWEVER, I will state it is a fun film if you can disassociate yourself from expecting anything ground-breaking- My main gripe was it was very similar to Avengers and ,if any of you have read it, The Ultimates. Evil force trying to eliminate the world via non-descript aliens/monsters to be foiled in the end by the crew etc. The final insult was too much screen time for Bloatman...I mean Batman/Affleck - I despise his acting and the fact he is cast as one of my favourite hero/anti-hero. Whoever cast him should be strung up from a tree.Overall: OK for a wet Sunday afternoon film but not worth paying for at the Cinema.",Suicide Squad
1145,shiva-kakkar11,Enjoyable film! Don't care about the critics. There's definitely some bias against it.,8,8 August 2016,"It's a pretty good movie. I never really gave an ear to conspiracies about movies getting berated but now I do believe that DC movies are deliberately underrated. I found Age of Ultron to be disappointing. Civil war was a decent film and by all counts I find suicide squad to be as good as civil war. It has loads of humor, a brilliant star cast, and a pretty good soundtrack. Margot Robbie really steals the show as Harley Quinn. The expectations I set from the trailer were indeed met. Critics are trying to portray it as something bad as Fantastic Four which is extremely unfair. And then there are some who are apparently calling it sexist for Margot Robbie's character. Word to all those 'liberals' - kiss my a**. She's the best comic relief and glamour quotient in the film and she totally kills it! She actually appears to be in crazy love with joker. The only part that could have been better was Jared Leto's joker. It was more of an add-on footage rather than having any real functional value to the plot. I wouldn't mind watching this movie again and I very much look forward to a sequel.",Suicide Squad
1146,romzz1,It's Alright...,5,6 August 2016,"Right I'm gonna skip the obvious stuff, Suicide Squad is a fun film, If you just want to see a decent Super hero... I mean Villain film, Stuff blow up, You get to see cool powers, Gun play, and funny moments here and there.I found it a little cliché, But this is where It gets personal, FOR ME, Heath Ledgers Joker is not only the best Joker ever to be on the big screen, It was also some of the best acting I've seen as of late, So anyone else going to play Joker after will have a tough time appealing to me on that level(even though he's hardly in the film), That aside, for characters without solo movies or solid established backstories it's pretty good!It's centred around Dead-shot and Harley mostly and I was fine with it, I think what makes this film even better is the Production, The colour scheme, the trailers, the Music and the posters/banners the way it was marketed I think made the lead up to the film much better but also was it's downfall as it wasn't that Great.Overall I can definitely see why people have mixed opinions on the film but from someone who mentally prepared himself to go into the film without high expectations of two of my favourite DC characters (Harley and Joker) It was a fun watch. Jared Leto's Joker is.. Interesting, I haven't seen enough to really judge so I'll hold back on that but I do like it, he's got that weird, crazy mob boss mentality. And as for Harley Quinn she was... OK too, nothing amazing, just adequate, I do think some of the writing let her down though so I'll give her that.The best character by far is Amanda Waller, she's like DC's Nick Fury, always one step ahead, always well informed. She was menacing and had good screen presence.Dead-shot is also in the same vein but to me it just felt like Hancock so basically, it's Will Smith. Good but capped. I wanted Dead-shot, not Will Smith dressed as Dead-shot but then again I don't think Dead- shot is a character of depth anyways so it did work.The rest of them, I didn't care for much, Enchantress was Cliché, her brother was just something to fight (with some sub par CGI), Cpt.Boomerang was alright although he hardly threw them, the only thing that kept coming back was his beer. Killer Croc looked cool, the make up and all but he was also kinda meh.Katana, was also very meh, one dimensional and since the only thing I compared it to was the Katana from the TV Show Arrow, it was hard as that show got rubbish too. (notice how I said ""got"")Diablo is actually cool, His back story was somewhat touching and I like how he's legit very reluctant to using his powers but what pushes him to do it is kinda ridiculous, but in general he was OK. I would've gone in depth but ... There wasn't much depth to the film to be completely honest.",Suicide Squad
1147,SimGunther,"An enjoyable, but incomplete mixed bag",1,5 August 2016,"Among one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters this year, Suicide Squad was supposed to be the answer for what would happen if David Ayer glossed his gritty vision over a superhero film that was destined to be dead on arrival. The initial trailers were enticing and opened many possibilities in mind as to how the rag-tag band of anti-heroes would go up against The Joker. For the first 20 minutes of the film, it was a fun ride as the gritty color palette and omniscient cinematography engrossed the audience into the dark world that was built for us to experience. A surprising amount of charisma from Jai Courtney along with a spectacular effort to bring a natural chemistry amongst the big collection of stars headlining this film and the amazing combo of Jared Leto and Margot Robbie brought hope in my mind in that it would be an exciting ride from beginning to end.It was after this point to where I realized that there was an insurmountable magnitude of studio interference similar to that of what happened to Fan4stic (2015). All the signs were there: scenes that would end abruptly, minuscule exposure to the one character we all wanted to know more about, and jump cut action sequences that have little to no meaning, almost as if Paul Greengrass has a few too many cups of coffee and collaborated with the editor of Columbiana and Alex Cross to make the most nauseating cuts known to film. The main difference that makes this film more enjoyable to watch over Fan4stic was the passion that went into the project and the witty writing that came with the interactions of the first act. However, this does not excuse the film from using unnecessary amounts of voice-over and flashback sequences that introduce the audience to these characters. If the film had brought along interactions with these characters that made some sense in that there was an implicit history of these characters that build up the back story naturally, it could open itself up for a multitude of endless creative possibilities that can be presented on screen for the ""Suicide Squad"" to shine on-screen. The remainder of the film gets dragged by the lack of agency that is presented in the structure of the plot. The final act of the film was nothing more than dull at best, frustrating at worst with a villain that might be one of the most cringe-worthy performances to ever come out of a plank of wood. Perhaps seeing the Suicide Squad go out of line from their initial objective a few times may bring intriguing possibilities of social commentary and even meaningful character growth out of some damaged characters looking for retribution while others want to continue there rebellious demeanor for the sake of their reputation. If there is no growth or conflict, is this really a film or a product? A piece of art to be appreciated and analyzed or a collection of cuts with no ultimate meaning to them?At the end of the day, the chemistry of the characters within the Suicide Squad and star power could be enough to bring comic-book fanatics into theaters, but ultimately suffers from the annoying amount of interference brought upon the film by Warner Brothers that sours this otherwise fantastic passion project. I want to urge studios everywhere that they should not have a stranglehold of the artistic vision that minds that David Ayer and Zack Snyder have over their projects for the sake of selling a product and producing several set- up films that set-up other set-up films. If this practice continues, we may end up settling for these kinds of films that feel more like products you would sell at the grocery store and we may never see film as art the way it should be. Do not settle for products like this and instead, wait for an unrated director's cut to come out (although I have a feeling that's what Warner Brothers is baiting with this whole time...).This film gets an (artsy Play-doh mess) out of 10.",Suicide Squad

1151,redfor,Keep pace with this swirling storytelling while cool in a theater,7,18 August 2016,"Gonna catch Suicide Squad? Consider bringing ear plugs. Don't attempt an understanding of all the subplots. Keep your 'suspension of disbelief' intact throughout (there are also some non-comic book elements).Early in the flick I thrilled to the styling-black hat Will Smith wore - - because it made me hear Agent J saying ""I make this look good,"" in my ears. The opening tune reminded me how badly I attempted to sing HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN in a high school talent show, but the song works perfectly here.Licensing usage of The Stone's classic hit, SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL, was brilliant. Used when Harley fabulously performs a bachelor-party routine in her cell, these lines are her persona deliciously defined: ""But what's puzzling you - Is the nature of my game."" The plot twists began arriving like an intense meteor shower. No Joker can have a love-hate relationship as a loner. Ours saves Harley from the vat of 'whatever', when he realizes he needs a female foil; two antagonists beat (or are stronger) than one in any, um, card game. When Amanda confesses to being the cat that ate the canary, she's not kidding: she's a great keeper of secrets.Deadshot's references to Phil Jackson will remain mysterious to many. If you're not an NBA fan, it might be better to quickly focus elsewhere. Cara Delevingne wonderfully brought to life the 'Enchantress' role. Karen Fukuhara has lots of acting offers coming her way. Cast and crew alike, performed a number of miracles to bring this work to the screen. With luck, they'll all further sustain their careers due to their involvement in the project.Be prepared for a LOUD final sequence. I know what approximates a 110 dB sound level (and have unfortunately proved this numerous times). In our theater, the sound pressure level reached at least 120 decibels. Protect your hearing and enjoy as much of this meandering summer fare as you can. Technically, it's quite a ride with some enjoyable high-points.",Suicide Squad
1152,shivamchowdhary336,"I am so, so, so, so disappointed.",2,14 August 2016,"So. This film. What do I even say about this film? Possibly the most disappointing film I've ever seen? First of all, let's talk about the pros (there aren't many.) The first pro is the first 30 minutes of this film was good. It was gritty, and brutal and I was rather surprised at the critics reviews at that point. The scenes of torture are great, and very stomach- turning. However, after 30 minutes, the film becomes the most generic action superhero movie ever to exist.Another pro are the performances. Everyone was committed to their role, especially Cara Delevingne as Enchantress, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. Cara Delevingne's character Enchantress was a great villain.I guess the last pro I can find is the movie was consistently funny and had me laughing. Sometimes accidentally (the slow motion scenes in fights? Really?) had me laughing like crazy, and sometimes Harley Quinn had me in stitches.Now the cons.WHERE THE HELL WAS THE JOKER? He was probably in this movie for about 5 minutes, and all his scenes were in the trailers for the film. His performance was good (I think? I couldn't judge due to the fact that he basically makes cameo appearances scattered throughout the film for no apparent reason that doesn't add to the story-line one bit. Wait, did I say story-line? Sorry, there is no story-line!) The story. What story? The first 30 minutes of the film is force-fed character development, and the rest of the film is the team trying to get from one end of the street to another without being attacked by these giant CGI blackberry thingies. Unfortunately; they stop every twenty seconds to either deliver a cheesy one-liner or stop to drink. Like, what?Also THE EDITING. The flashback sequences with Harley Quinn and the Joker feel so, so, so out of place (especially the torture sequence,) and the editing makes the film so confusing and hard to follow. The film tries to cram way too much source material into one film, and the film just feels like a massive build up for the standalone Harley Quinn film coming in 2019. Also, Batman was hardly in the movie but Ben Affleck even looked like he didn't care anymore. Also Slipknot. I'm not even going to get into this character as I can't without giving spoilers, but what the hell were the writers thinking? Why was he even in the film?And so, so, so much more is wrong with this film. The writing is confusing; the film is overlong; the film barely has any story and the character development feels so forced. It is so obvious that the film was dark, and gritty (proved by the film's first act,) but the studio decided it should be more light with poor editing. So, now you have a tonally confused movie (some scenes are very dark, some are very light, some are gory, some are G-level violence) with choppy editing. I mean, what?I'm giving 2 stars for this film. One star for the film's first 30 minutes; and one star for the performance of Enchantress. Even though she looked like she was hula dancing for all the film; she provided a consistently good performance throughout. Overall, a great start, but then dumbs down into a tonally weird, laughably bad film with some good performances. It's a shame the talent was completely wasted on the poor film. I really wanted to like it; and I did for 30 minutes!Then I got bored. Sorry DCEU, I've officially given up with you after the convoluted messy pile of dog poop you called BvS, and this poorly editing light/dark film Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad
1153,niccolot,Not as bad as it seems,7,5 August 2016,"Let me start out by saying I was very excited for this movie. After the Dark Knight trilogy concluded I have been ready for the DC universe to actually become a universe instead of just Batman and now suicide squad is the 3rd movie of the DC universe movies. The critics have not expressed positive feedback on any and suicide squad followed that tradition. Now as a huge fan of superhero movies, I was very excited for a villain superhero movie to come out. With this movie it shows how different it is than any comic book movie we've seen in the past, which is something I really liked. I also feel like one positive thing that has been said about the movie is the performances by Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis in general... and I have to say those three actors took those roles and showed exactly why they were cast. With some awesome performances, a great idea, and a lot of fun action I liked this movie, but there's still problems with it. When looking at this movie not as a comic book movie and just a fantasy, action-packed movie it falls short. The movie feels very choppy with the editing that was in it, and there were many plot holes that can be seen that just take you out of the movie. All in all Suicide Squad is not a horrible movie, it's just not necessarily a well made movie, but the movie was still a lot of fun to see. I recommend seeing it if you were excited to, just because mindlessly watching this movie is extremely enjoyable.",Suicide Squad
1154,lukesummers1995,"Loved it, don't listen to the haters....",9,18 August 2016,"Awesome film, great cast, lots of fun!This is a movie not to be taken too seriously, it's an experiment and a hell of a fun one, Jared Leto is not trying to be the new Heath Ledger with his limited screen time and more comic book approach and that lil' bit of Batman you see in the movie is not some Oscar winning work. The overall film was great, extremely fun and interesting, especially for people that haven't read many of the DC UNiverse comic books, that get a chance to hear about some of the lesser known characters such as The Enchantress and Captain Boomerang.The overall plot/story line is very entertaining though quite a lot is filled into such a short film, would've loved it to be a lot longer.I myself have always been a huge fan of the DC universe, I love the games, the movies, the cartoons, never really read many of the comic books, but there's still time for that, my favorite Batman universe is the one of which the games are based around, the Arkham story, so it was nice to see characters from that franchise depicted in a new way. I was particularly interested in the character El Diablo, as I have never heard of this character within the DC universe and the actor playing him did a great job, they all did great jobs with the characters they had and the screen time they had.Overall, I can't wait for the sequel, I love all DC's media creations, don't listen to the haters, watch it first and gather your own opinion, 9/10 due to the fact it could have been longer, wasn't too keen on the new Batman and wasn't keen on the Waller character, though she is integral to the story.",Suicide Squad
1155,noirunicorn,Huge disappointment,2,6 August 2016,"$20 for this junk is a total rip off. This movie is just another failure from DC. Full of cliché. And what the $^%& with those slow motions? some shitty movies from the 90's? How come they can create a decent Joker in cartoons, but cant find anyone that can play this role correctly? Also nothing crazy on Harley besides some sexual suggestions from time to time. Maybe the director can find better career in porno industry from the 90's. Those 'touching feeling sharing' time are just long awkward moments. Retarded stunt coordinator too, and they call this close to real life military operations? I like DC, but Marvel just can make much better movies than DC.",Suicide Squad
1156,ceoslari,"A really good and enjoyable movie that would better with a little bit jokes less, not the best movie of all time but still very good.",8,7 August 2016,"It was a really good movie, the first part was very dynamic and fast, the characters were introduced very well on my opinion and the cameos of Batman and Flash were amazing, I liked how some of the characters where described showing us that they have a life at long of the movie in order to make us feel empathy with them and their motivations, just talking about Deadshot, Harley, Diablo and a little bit Katana but really little, if the objective was to make fell identified with her it missed more of backstory of her in my opinion, we know almost nothing about captain boomerang but it was not necessary in my opinion because his personality is pointed since the beginning of the movie the same for killer Croc, the dead of Slipknot was to prove a point, it was not wasted for me, I mean they are bad guys, and obviously they are going to try to escape if they have an opportunity, it was necessary to make us see that they were not born yesterday and just they believed that they have a bomb inside them. I like the funny and light tone of the movie, the humor was good and loved that it did not reach the point of being ridiculous, just I think it would be perfect with little bit less jokes because some parts that supposed to be serious lost the idea of the scene because of a joke, for example the scene in the bar, they are discussing things about each other and suddenly a joke from Harley, but still some other scenes serious despite the tone funny of the movie and it really helped to the movie to feel emotions about it, example the final moments fighting enchantress when Harley hit her and Deadshot shot the bomb, I totally agree with the idea of having different kind of movies in the DCU, BvS had to be dark this one had to be funny, we do not always want the same just the tone than is needed depending of the kind of movie, but always keeping the essence of the characters in each movie without change them as it was for Batman and his brief appearance, and talking about Batman, why in BvS he did not have problems killing bad guys and in this movie he strove to save Harley, I mean she the worst of the worst that's not logical.The Music was Awesome, the mix of music hits and the soundtrack itself helped to feel a lot to the immersion of the movie, except some parts of the joker were I felt they were trying to force us think that he is crazy, I felt even in some parts Harley crazier than him because of it, but despite this for me the joker was actually very good although we didn't see him too much, I think we see him enough for the effects of the movie, because it was necessary to describe the past of Harley and he is part of it, I mean his apparition was not as forced.I think it was necessary to the suicide squad to have more moments among them, to share, to feel empathy, because we as audience felt it (or at least I did) but not them, this in order to understand the final decision they took, for example why they stayed, it was understandable for Deadshot, but why the other, this also leads into the exaggerated final decision of Diablo when he sacrifices himself referring to the team as a family, I did not felt it credible, their relationship was not too strong to said that, at least that something in the bar or before was erased, now, why to release a extended version (if they think to release one) they are wasting a good movie in the cinema that could be much better and could avoid too many bad critics, if they just show the extended version directly in the cinemas, believe me, if the movie is good enough WE WILL BUY IT and you do not have to ""force"" us to buy a blue ray to see the extended version just to you to earn a little bit more money. The action scenes were just amazing, also the camera shots were incredible and very satisfactory, Too many people described this movie as disappointing, disastrous, bad movie, dumb, with poor plot, messy and similar adjectives, but the movie is far from that, it was not the best superhero or antihero movie, but definitely it is not that bad, it's sad to know that too many people hate a franchise of movies just because, it is important to point the bad and good point of a movie but not with that hate. So as a finale verdict,The worst: Some situations little forced, like some scenes of the joker, the fake union of the team and some moments lost by the jokes.The best, Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, the action moments, the music, the funny tone of the movie and Jared Leto despite his brief apparition and I am very excited about the next movies of the DCU, the work of WB and DC has been despite the critics very interesting because of its controversy, that does not mean it has been bad.",Suicide Squad
1157,milesd-94784,Makes me wanna commit SUICIDE via firing SQUAD,1,9 August 2016,"I don't know where to begin with, this, um... film? Oddly enough it too suffers the same problem; it doesn't know what it is or wants to be. You can liken its handling of story-telling with a bull in a china shop. But I may as well dig into the meat and potatoes of this ""really, really bad"" film.One aspect often cited in praise of the film, are the performances and chemistry, notably of and between Will Smith and Margot Robbie. Smith is fine as the sharpshooter Deadshot, He's a roguish Will Smith, what more can I say. I feel Robbie put her all into the ""deranged"" Harley Quinn, but the writing for her character erred too much on the side of goofy, to be believable. And this goes for all the characters in the film really, they all have their one-dimensional, underdeveloped roles and any character attempting to be funny merely served as a one-liner dispenser and not a particularly good one. These are supposed to be despicable (soon to be reformed) ""bad-guys"" but their characters are so thin and underwritten that they end up coming off less intimidating than a door mouse. And when the film tries to hunker down (in a bar) to get all serious; it's so unearned, cartoony and cheesy, for there to be any emotional heft whatsoever, feeling more like a box to tick than an artistic choice.The structure of the film is, by and large, the biggest issue. It's already been said countless times, but the editing was childish and amateur at best. the first half of the film serves as a consecutive set of trailers for presumably, better stand alone films. The sequences were littered with forced and ill-fitting songs whose soul purpose was to inject the film with character where the writing, directing and acting could not. The second half serves as a predictable low-stakes action film. It was filled to the brim with pointless, uninteresting antagonists, whose plan is just as flimsy as their dialogue; a ridiculous spectacle ending that made no sense and action sequences with pointless, faceless goons. Sprinkled throughout were poor character development, bland expository dialogue and ham-fisted attempts at being emotional. It doesn't help when I'm taken out of the film every five seconds to think about the relentless amount of plot holes, contrivances, and continuity errors that could fill two small estates. The one saving grace was Jared Leto's silly portrayal of The Joker, who, while not getting the reaction from me Leto probably intended, had me sniggering all the way through his scenes. As for Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, well let me say the film is way out of her league; I think she'd be more intimidating in a better-written movie. Other than Leto, the film is a bore.",Suicide Squad

DC has always been dark. No stupid jokes as Marvel. I never listen to the critics. I like to have my own opinion about any film. You do not like the film? Well, that's just like your opinion, man. Alas, some of those ""critics"" are only saying what they hear without even see the actual film. These critics needs and enema! As a DC fan, this film was wicked. There is some imagery I thought we had never see on the big screen. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Just incredible. I have heard a lot of people barking mad about ""Harley being too sexy"" Why so salty? She is wearing hot pants because they are sparkly and fun. She does not do it because she wants blokes to look at her arse. Jared Leto as The Joker was good. That whole thug-life/Lil Wayne/Ellen Degeneres on a rough day Joker look I was not keen on, but thankfully he was not like that all the time. In general, everyone played an excellent part.Only beef, Enchantress and Incubus. They are the worst comic book movie villains of all time. At least we know what the endlessly dull Malekith from Thor: The Dark World wants. At least Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze is a campy hoot to watch and quote. At least Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was weird enough to create conversation and at least Doomsday felt like a world-threatening force of nature (even thought he looked like Chet from Weird Science). These two want to destroy humanity just because. Alas, Cara Delevingne, she was not right for this part in my opinion. Whatever the whole ""waving your arms around in slow motion"" thing just looked silly. She was pretty bloody horrible. She cannot act.Good movie, just let down by weird editing and direction choices.",Suicide Squad
1159,assassin-42523,Terrific start but slowly turned into a bland and terrible movie,5,10 August 2016,"Plot: Basic superhero plot with literally nothing special. Started out pretty decent with the character's introduction sequence but then dragged it out for 1 hour making it terribly boring. Not to mention, you don't make a movie with a ""SUICIDE"" in the title but ends up making it comedic and not one moment of tension. Furthermore, the editor screws it up, showing the plot twist way before its moment, and it's not even a hard to guess one. 4/10Soundtrack: Best part of the movie with classics ranging from The Rolling Stones to Queen to Slim Shady to RadioheadHowever, really bad timing and editing, you don't put ""Without Me"" and then cut the rapping, you don't put on ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" then cut abruptly 30 seconds after the intro. And so on9/10 for bad timingVisual: While the fighting scenes have some decent CGI and Killer Croc is pretty real, it felt like they've used up all the money so everything else like the background city or the practical effects are very simple and basic, making 40% of the movie look fake as hell, which in the kind of movies like this, doesn't show the seriousness of the situation.Usually use medium shot to close up to get a feel of the character yet only focus on Harley Quinn, which is annoying6/10Characters:Good acting, however, the screen writing sucks, Joker is a sociopath who don't care for anything except making the Bat suffers, Harley Quinn barely can fight, Deadshot is the head of the squad, not just some guy who can shoot and so on.

1160,josepitheman,pooicide squad,5,10 August 2016,"SPOILERS AHEAD For anyone considering watching this film I would maybe wait for it to come on TV. You wont regret waiting when you see it. One thing this film makes you ask is where is the justice league, why are the suicide squad trying to stop someone far more powerful than any of them are? In comics you find them fighting jihad and going on different missions to what this movie had. All in all batman, flash, wonder women and aqua man seem a far better choice than a load of villains. I personally think one of the worse things this film did is humanise these villains. They are all baddies of the dc world so humanise them makes me think Batman is an arse**le. Either way now to the fact they are all in prison, all of the character are serving time for this or that and some stupid women decideds that she wants to start a team of villains. Entantress was most likely the best character for me. She was also the overall villain of the film. Releasing her brother from captivity in some kind of relic, they start laying havoc to the city and this is where the suicide squad steps in. They fight these strange zombie like rock creatures to make their way to some whole in the sky that is going to lay waste to the earth. Deadshot and co fight their way through, with corny jokes and a very hot margot robbie in tow. The most chesesy line of the film came from harley herself, ""LADY YOU FORGOT ONE THINGS, THERE MY FRIENDS. Really silly ending. I was waiting for batman or the flash to turn up and whip some arse. The flash could have dealt with the issues with ease. POINTLESS FILM POINTLESS story and a pointless ending. I can be over critical of films sometimes but this is a film made for under 10 year olds. It was dark enough and it wasn't the suicide squad. They are supposed to be villains not super heroes and they went to much for the hero vibe. No wonder Tom Hardy turned this film down.The last bit i want to touch base on is the joker. Jared Leto just wasn't right, i like the actor but he just didn't seem to have any chemistry with the role. I didn't believe in harley and him i didn't believe he is the joker. So batman makers and dc film makers here is a way to save your hides. Make this joker the robin that joker tortured into joker and make a new joker casting for the next batman film. Personally i think william defoe would be a great joker",Suicide Squad
1161,aaronperry,"Great Acting, Bad Plot...",9,7 August 2016,"The cast of suicide squad is great because the actors really brought the characters to life, but thestory line/Plot was dumb. They are used to fight in a battle between a witch, a witch in Gotham city?? Stupid and makes no since. The Film got a score of 30% on rotten tomatoes which is shocking cause the film is successful and the acting is great but the plot line did suck.But overall it was a good experience and luckily the witch will not be in the next film so the next film will be more realistic.Harley Quinn played by actress Margot Robbie brought the character to life, she has great acting skills and never went out of character.The Joker played by Jared Leto also did a great job in the film.",Suicide Squad
1162,daxsir,Harley Quinn,9,27 December 2016,"I have just watched the extended version on blue ray and really enjoyed it. I had heard all the poor reviews but now i can't understand why it got them. It spent more time on Character building then most of the Marvel films. It didn't rely just on special effects either though they were good. I wanted to watch it for Harley Quinn who was excellent. No special powers as such but her madness has made her quite athletic and good with weapons. In the extended version she shows a skill of being able to read people. She is also hot funny and very cool. I enjoyed Will Smith as dead shot, Croc man was good. The Joker was also very interesting to watch and the love link between him and Harley was believable and you started to root that they worked out. Like i have read here perhaps how powerful the baddies were was its main flaw against the lesser powers of the squad but its a fantasy film not a movie you expect to be to true to life. I would love to see a follow up or a spin off with Harley and the Joker. The trouble is now you want them to win.",Suicide Squad
1163,petarjovanchevic,"For what it is, it's excellent",10,8 August 2016,"Most people fell in love with the story of the DC comic book lore, but majority of people (such as myself) didn't really get to dig deeper into the lore due to various reasons (eg. comic books weren't distributed here, cartoons and movies in the past weren't exactly captivating, etc.)With that in mind, most people that will like this movie are people that fell in love with the idea of Joker, with the idea of Batman, there are no bars set, so the movie makes that leap with ease.Comic book dorks need to take a chill pill, and critics should look for the meaning of life elsewhere, Suicide Squad isn't here to be the next ""Godfather"", it's here as a FUN and Exciting summer blockbuster.",Suicide Squad
1164,christopherholich,Fantastic Movie!,7,31 July 2016,"Wow. Got out of the early screening earlier and was super surprised. First thing i want to talk about is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. She did an amazing job, at times it can be confusing because her voice switches from her signature Brooklyn accent to just a normal American voice but it works out perfectly. Jared Leto is great, he is a very controversial pick as the Joker but i think reactions will be mixed, I think he was fantastic though. Not enough of him either. Then there was Will Smith as Deadshot, he was more or less the main leader of the suicide squad (or the squad) Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was probably the best casting In a superhero movie since Rdj as Iron Man. She was so menacing and is such an amazing actress. Batfleck is in it for a little, you were expecting him to play into the story more, but every scene he was in the crowd was Cheering. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Killer Croc, who was good, but wasn't a stand-out like I was hoping, although they didn't really put him in it to much but he was still good. Diablo was an okay character, easily has the most bad ass powers in the squad though. People Do die. I'm not going to say who, but if you watch the trailers there is a certain somebody in the squad who you assume does die... If you know who that is then you know who dies. The first 15 minutes of the movie is pretty slow. It shows all the villain's backstories. Flash interacts with Boomerang which was an Amazing scene. The flash is awesome so hyped for Justice Leauge. All in all this movie had enough Comedy and Action to blend in to an amazing summer movie. I won't compare it to Bvs Or Captain America because it isn't fair, they are all good in there own way. I highly recommend it. Go see this movie in theaters August 5th and buy it on DVD when it comes out. It's highly worth your time.",Suicide Squad
1165,jmsantana,Characters were cool........plot/story.....not so much,6,12 August 2016,"I'm not a die-hard super hero fan, so when I got invited to watch this movie I had no expectations of it. I wasn't expecting it to be very good or very bad. And that's kind of where it was for me, somewhere in the middle. If I had watched only the first 35 minutes of the movie, I would have left with a much better review of it. I thought that the characters were awesome. They were funny, quirky, strange, tough, and unique. And for me that was just about all I got out of the movie; the characters. The plot line was not interesting, not original, and no one who enjoyed the movie is out there saying ""oh wow that story was awesome."" But again, the movie did a good job introducing us to these comic characters.*Spoiler* Not really but whatever From a technical standpoint it seems as though they tried really really hard to make this movie, and then got tired at some point and said who cares, lets wrap it up as is, people will watch it anyways. There was a scene where the squad is in a helicopter and it gets shot and the way it came down was done well; at first it slowly circled around in flames, then crashed and tumbled its way to a stop. Moments later when the boss lady, Amanda Waller is in a helicopter that gets shot the same way in the same place, the way it came down was a weird animated super fast need-for-speed video game looking metal crash and slide. It was very weird and threw me off.Again, the characters were cool, story......not so much.",Suicide Squad
1166,AnakinSkywalker03,Awesome,10,8 August 2016,"Watched the movie yesterday i thought it was awesome, i was looking forward to more scenes with the joker i guess the joker and harley quinn was the main reason i actually wanted to watch this movie.. well with the scenes you had of them was just amazing and the style of the movie was so cool i loved the costumes and just the way the movie is made. Acting was 10 out of 10 this is by far the best joker ever Jared leto absolutely nailed it as him. Im just very impressed by this movie haven't watched something this good in a long time it was a very fun movie with lots of action. I would have loved to just get to know the character's a bit more only if the movie was a bit longer but you guys obviously are having more movies come out. Please don't change anything about the joker and harley i love them the way they are!!! The only thing i am disappointed in is that you picked cara delevingne to act as one of the characters she is shocking and she makes me sick please get rid of her nobody likes her in movies you made a big mistake picking her for the role she is a horrible actor.",Suicide Squad
1167,zdedyomix,A beautiful disaster...,5,5 August 2016,"I walked into this film with 0 expectations. From a film-making perspective, this film is a mess, edited so poorly and chopped up to no end. Warner Bros. execs need to stop screwing with their directors and just need to let them make their films! GREAT action! The action sequences in this film are definitely highlights, but an overuse of slow-motion shots takes away from it a bit. The beginning of the film, specifically the character introductions, were very nice to see. It looked and felt like pages of a comic book right there on the screen!The film essentially had a 1st and 3rd act, and it seemed like much of the 3rd act's villain was meant to be there, instead of within the first half hour of the film. Many of the characters had multiple motivations toward the end. Generic villain plot with beam in sky we've seen in Avengers, TMNT 1, MoS, Fant4stic, and again just this summer with TMNT 2 and Ghostbusters. Why can't we get an original story where the villain doesn't need a device???",Suicide Squad
1168,puneetj-61988,Long way to go for DC to catch up with Mravel,6,8 August 2016,"I went in with a lot of expectations from suicide squad. The trailers had been brilliant and the excitement of seeing a new joker had me excited to the limit. But the movie was a disappointment. Margot Robbie(Harley Quinn) and Will Smith(Deadshot) gave a very good performance but again the story line disappointed. Marvel took there time introducing new characters and then building on them in subsequent movies, DC in there haste to catch up are goofing it all up. In Joker DC have by far the best antagonist of comic books, and in Jared Leto they have found a perfect replacement for Late Heath Ledger but the writers at Warner Bros let him down. Margot Robbie was outstanding as Harley Quinn and she was the only reason I am giving the movie a 6 rating. Overall DC built a very good story but were let down by the script writers. The movie lacks flow and could had been way way way better. Once a watch for me but even if you miss the movie you wont be missing out on a lot.",Suicide Squad
1169,channellius,Flashy but that's mostly it,5,27 February 2017,"This movie had a lot of special effects and action, but the plot was fairly poor, and there were a lot of things that didn't make sense.

I feel like this movie could have showcased the specific villains a bit more, especially with their powers and techniques.",Suicide Squad
1170,jayfemsantana,Excellent!,9,6 August 2016,"David Ayers delivered every expectations that I had for Suicide Squad; after carefully watching this movie two times to study the casting and the plot delivery of the film, I must say I absolutely love it. I am not sure why it was rated a 7.3 when I strongly believe that it should of had a higher rate. You know when your extremely hungry and see food for the first time since your last meal? you know that excitement you get? well, that's how it was for me. There are so many good things to talk about this film; Lets start with the cast, the energy these actors portrayed in there roles was thrilling, every actor chosen by the casting director Lindsay Graham and Mary Vernieu were well analyzed. The graphics of the movies were out of this world, the colors and the bubbly fonts matched perfectly with the theme. Steven Price did such a good job choosing the soundtrack of Suicide Squad, that as soon as I got out of the advance movie screening I went to iTunes and downloaded the whole soundtrack of this film (my favorite song is Kehlani-Gangster). I recently had commented on a film I had reviewed that to be able to have a successful movie specially if its 2 hours long, it had to be able to catch the audience attention. This film had me smiling the whole 2 hours of excitement, it was a reminder why I will never regret choosing the field of Academia studies that I choosed. I would watch this movie over and over again, and I am not a second movie watcher. The editor of Suicide Squad Steven Price did a phenomenal job, every scene was perfectly cut and the color correcting was fantastic! everything was in sync and not once did I notice any error. I must say that 3/4th proceeding to the ending of the film, I felt like Cara Delevingne character (known as Enchantress) was becoming a little bit superficial to me, I loved the whole dark spooky design of the character, but then it became a little too ""clean"" and well cut when she got her power back; But overall, I can eat cupcakes and watch this movie! DC comics did a great job!",Suicide Squad
1171,alyxnichols,wowie,3,18 February 2017,"this movie was fearless and crazier than even batman VS superman, it was DC's queen and god help anyone that dared watch suicide squad because the might possibly commit suicide over the waist of money that is this horribly made s**t show filled with actors that aren't actors and bad quotes.they had 20 main characters and they don't get passed introductions with any of them. all the dialogue sounded like a 12 year olds jokerxreader fanfiction that she wrote while she was sick at home and drooling from pain meds, and despite the ""cool powers"" they were all given out of some edgy c***s ocs on deviant art they couldn't for the life of them do anything well, i honestly don't remember if they killed a single thing or just talked about how they kill things.

1172,britstack,Suicide Squad: Be Your Own Critic,8,18 August 2016,"This movie despite what critics want to say is a fantastic piece of cinematic feature. I haven't written a review in a long time... So here it goes, I rate this with an 8 because this movie stayed in my opinion to the beginning of Suicide Squad. I never read any Batman comic except for The Killing Joke. Therefore, I have no basis for comparison, but his movie with an open mind was brilliant and enjoyable. It is my belief that people including the critics went into it with a total different perspective and that's why these people are let down. The cinematography and dialogue were on point. It is a one of a class film and I saw it TWICE in theatre. I wanted to prove the critics wrong. So many people I know or don't loved this movie. It's the critics and die hard Marvel fans that are turning this movie to crap. The Joker should have been in it more I will agree but in the end, I believe the crew and cast were just introducing the population to what Suicide Squad is. Reshooting is a bit of a pain, but ultimately the cast was great especially featuring stars like Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Both did an excellent portrayal of the characters. This movie when you see it and you will is meant to be seen as a movie first and foremost. I'm so sick of people bashing good movies just because of critics. Be YOUR own critic. Instead of listening to others. Btw, I'm a die hard Batman fanatic. So when people want to dis the Bat I have to disagree. Seriously, the movie and music are both great.

I really liked the idea of this movie, and the concept was amazing. I reckon if the writers spent a longer time on the movie, it could be one of the best DC has ever produced. Although the cast and soundtrack were great, I really thought hat the movie would overall be much better.",Suicide Squad
1174,ianjwood-73912,"A good movie, so much wasted potential.",7,17 October 2016,"I have been waiting a long time to watch this, finally got the chance today.I'll start with the characters, it's understandable that with so many characters some get pushed to the back. Suicide Squad felt like that, the only people from the team to get a decent screen time and back story is Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Which isn't all that shocking, them being the biggest stars in the movie. I felt like all the characters were two dimensional, not offering much character development or depth.Will Smith stands above the rest, it felt like a Deadshot movie at times, which would be great, but it is meant to be the Suicide Squad, not Deadshot and pals. I loved Diablo, you can't fault any of the casting, all the actors suited the characters. The only issue with Diablo is it seemed so rushed, 0 too 100 in seconds, he never really showcases much, all the awesome things he could do, he turns into a massive fire demon and has a wrestling match with Incubus. Reminded me of the Green Lantern movie, all the possibilities and they go with something boring and unimaginative. Now we get to the Joker, Jared Leto offers a new take on what's one of the most iconic DC bad guys. As good as Leto did, it made no sense to have Joker in this movie, other than for Harley's origins. He seemed to add nothing to the movie. I mean, it's the Joker, I expected some crazy plan/sub plot, all we got was a sub-par rescue attempt. I enjoyed how Enchantress was portrayed, the only thing I didn't like was the weird dance moves when she was tearing the sky open. It seems pointless going into the other members of the Suicide Squad, considering they didn't find the time to either.Having seen Assault on Arkham, I had really high expectations, it being one of my favourite animated movies. They do something Suicide Squad doesn't, make you connect to all the characters. Suicide Squad would have been much better if they had either used King Shark, or made Killer Croc half decent, he looked like gravel painted green. He's meant to be a monster, an anthropomorphic crocodile, not a gecko with human limbs. The plot seemed miss paced, it spent 40 minutes introducing the characters, yet they still couldn't make you feel for them. The ending was lacklustre, I feel like Incubus fighting Diablo was boring. It's two very powerful beings fighting, yet I still felt like there was no real threat throughout the movie. They could just have easy been fighting over the last yogurt in the fridge. I was short of hoping for awesome superhero action.I had fun watching Suicide Squad, I loved Harley Quinn and Deadshot, they was done really well. My review may seem harsh, I actually enjoyed the movie, I will probably end up watching it again, but it doesn't change all the flaws and mistakes. I wish it was better, nothing would be better than DC catching up with Marvel and us having two amazing universes.

1178,ronald_henry,"As Alfred would put it: 'Ooooo, how to best describe it??'",6,28 September 2017,"Essentially, half this movie is filled with flashbacks, outlining each character's purpose in the story as well as providing a connected relationship with the characters. This movie seems to be dedicated to flashbacks which mostly focuses on Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, connected with The Joker played by Jared Leto and Deadshot played by Will Smith. The others seem to be brief mostly to keep the group as a whole at bay.I'm in two minds about the layout of this film. This method can be seen as a good way to portray each character's origin story which means this film's purpose was to focus on each the character's biography to lead up to a much important sequel such as the Justice League or perhaps making a sequel to Suicide Squad which seems possible. Many films do that these days, they take there time to dive deeper into the story, separating them into chapters which is the best way to get the point across.Honestly with the performance of Harley Quinn and Deadshot in the picture was the highlight of this movie. I think because of the mix reviews of Batman vs Superman, the production team panicked and added random elements to the move to make it more lively, but they did take the time think it through. They just simply but popular songs together in separate sequences which didn't always mesh with the film.I think the trailer provided a false advertising story. The trailer made it seem like it was the Suicide Squad against The Joker, but there's nothing like that in the movie. I feel like the Joker was present as a supporting act for the Harley Quinn's character in order to create awareness, which makes sense even though Margot Robbie's performance was impressive on her own.However, I feel somewhere in this movie has something good coming from it but it's just hidden and formed into a core surrounded by a mesh of different stories all force into one, making it even more difficult to point out exactly where the good is coming from.Overall, this movie seemed to have clever dramatic scenes, a few comical moments added with some decent actions scene with touch of oversimplified or stereotypical representation through out.

But it is a very rare instance that you come across a film that actually insults the intelligence of the viewer, and has such a minimal understanding of how to create a conceivably acceptable film.This film has so many flaws, and so much bullsh!t logic that a lot of it flies over your head, not to mention the *horrible* script that puts absolutely no effort into hiding exposition, or make the characters interesting. The editing is one of the fatal flaws, as it is mostly unbearably difficult to figure out what is even happening most of the time, and the titles are subtitles that appear on-screen are displayed so lazily and out of place that not only do you not get enough time to read them, but early in the film one piece of o- screen text becomes greatly obscured by the background. This is a child's level of editing, and its infuriating to watch.The fact that this film can be rightfully named an Academy Award Winner is an utter disgrace, exactly what was so good about Harley Quinn's face paint, and Killer Croc's laughable stupid kids costume?

Anyone saying there are no memorable characters are in pure denial. With all the girls dressing up as Suicide Squad's Harley Quinn and so many guys using Suicide Squad's Joker as their profile pic, those characters will not be forgotten for years to come. I know a lot get annoyed between bouncing from backstories to story to action constantly but I love it. I love backstories to characters, and following storyline that lead to action. I hate most action movies because there isn't enough of a backstory or storyline in them. In ways this reminds me of the whole A Nightmare on Elm Street. You had a story not just a horror movie. Freddy was funny not silent like Jason. And we got reminded of his backstory as well. So we knew why he was the way he was.

1185,Mazinger31,An entertaining flick with its share of hiccups.,5,25 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was panned by critics but seemingly beloved by fans. This movie was nowhere near as bad as critics said it was. As a whole, the film really slows down once the squad enters the smoldering ruins of the city. The pacing is inconsistent, either being fun and action-packed or dull and dreary. The film spent a large portion of its run-time trying to find its identity without fully succeeding. That being said, most of the cast was terrific. Viola Davis, Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Jay Hernandez all delivered memorable roles. Jared Leto's Joker was enjoyable despite the fact that the dynamic in the Joker-Harley love story was scrapped and replaced by WB execs for that sweet, sweet merchandise money. I wasn't a huge fan of the lovey-dovey Joker-Harley love story but it was Oscar-worthy compared to that of Rick Flagg-Enchantress. This pitiful attempt at a love story served as nothing more than a crummy plot device. Zero chemistry and little background was given to this toilet paper tapestry of love. Joel Kinnaman did not sell me on Rick Flagg and the model playing Enchantress was basically just CGI that was dubbed over. This was by far the weakest portion of the film's story and unfortunately made up a large part of the plot. Was this film bad? No, but it had its shortcomings. I left the theater entertained but slightly disappointed. The more I hear about WB forcing director David Ayers to re-shoot and edit certain scenes make me want to see a director's cut. I feel like Ayers' original vision would surpass the watered-down cut many audiences saw.",Suicide Squad

1190,J-Star,"""Decent"" film, in all meanings of the word. Avoid the trailers if you still can.",7,4 August 2016,"This is a very decent film, and that is its problem. The feeling I suspect most will have after seeing it is: ""Yeah it was good. *beat* But(!)..."", this was not what I expected it to be. Unlike The Other Anti-Hero Movie of 2016, you can tell that Suicide Squad was a corporate product and not one of enthusiasts and fans. There are heaps of experience and talent on the screen, supported by loads of money and production values, and this affects the film in a very positive way. But all of that is still very restrained. The story does not go out on a limb at any time, while most characters and their actors are completely under-used. This is most noticeable with Jared Leto that does not get to let loose as The Joker as much he could but instead gets relegated to be a crowd-baiting bolt-on. Only Margot Robbie gets to excel as Harley, and even so with a few caveats.The story seems all over the place at first but once you reach the end you see that it is very safe ""Good Guys Vs. Bad Guys"" affair. Marketing tries to tell us that the Squad are baddies, but at the same time the character development desperately drives home the point — over and over — that all the protagonists are actually (kind of) good. It even gets to the point where Deadshot explicitly tells us that the Squad are ""the bad guys"", and it fails miserably; Will Smith does not a convincing baddie make. And when Harley is day-dreaming about being The Joker's loving housewife it feels like blatant corporate executive meddling in action, where you can sense how they flinched and winced at the thought of ""bad"" characters being the heroes. As such, this is not at all the anti-hero film that it was touted as, but instead a very decent — in the meaning ""well-behaved"" — film, and that is not what I came for.Another thing that adds to the ""But.."" is that the trailers lead us to believe that the film will be a half-mad, full-tempo roller coaster ride. It is not that. That is not to say that the pacing is unfitting or wrong for the story, not at all. But it is different from what I was made to expect, meaning I came to the theater in the wrong mood, and that threw me off. After seeing the film I wish I never saw the trailers before I went.In the end, Suicide Squad is a decent flick — in all meanings of the word — that could have gone at least two steps further. But the concept, the story and the characters were all put on a very tight leash. It is as if the film itself — just like the characters — is operating under a constant death threat from the leadership, forcing it to behave well and not stray. Still, the film, the story and the actors all manage to perform admirably within their constraints, and as such I recommend watching.Just do not see the trailers before you go. Oh darn... too late.",Suicide Squad

But out of the garbage we received probably the best Batman Antihero since Heath Ledger's Joker. Margot Robbie absolutely destroyed as Harley Quinn. She follows it up in Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad. The other highlight from the original Suicide Squad was Jai Courtney as boomerang. Somehow, a B list character becomes the second favorite character of the film. Suicide Squad was so awful!

Every aspect of the movie is just disappointing from it's predictable plot to the underveloped characters to it's crappy editing and poorly rendered C.G.I and David Ayer's Direction. Suicide Squad tries a different tone than the previous two DC films with much more humor and fun and it largely fails to deliver. The actors have zero chemistry between them and their characters doesn't connect with me at all and most of their performance are either underwhelming or annoying. Jared Leto's performance as the Joker was great, but he has too little to do with the plot. The most disappointing thing about Suicide Squad is it's action sequences which is the biggest joke of the movie.",Suicide Squad

I would see the crowd come in all excited and then leave 2 hours later sadly disappointed. I never went to see it on the big screen. Instead, I waited for Cable. (and he was great in DEADPOOL 2) So when I finally saw ""Suicide Squad"" I was surprised. Sure it wasn't great, but it wasn't the steaming pile of stuff everyone said it was. Will smith did enough to be paid, Cara Delveingne wiggled, and Margot Robbie proved she had the charisma to hold the audiences attention facing the camera or not. Would I tell you to pay $15 to see this film? Not really. But if you're home one day and it's on TNT or TBS stop and take another look. It has it's moments.",Suicide Squad
1198,jasonew-39026,Little more than a jumbled mess,1,13 June 2020,"Suicide Squad
2016
Little more than a jumbled mess, Suicide Squad will hurt your head if you actually try sitting and watching it for more than five minutes at a time. There is no real story, absolutely no character development, a script that serves more as a series of one liners, and editing that is non-existent. This movie is just a series of music videos that were strewn together with absolutely no regard for a plot.
What if Superman was bad? Who would fight him? Amanda Waller has that figured out
with Task Force X, a group of highly skilled and metahuman convicts. Now, with a terrorist incident and no one else to turn to, the Suicide Squad is sent in to save the day.
Let me just say that I really wanted to like this movie. After the atrocity that was Batman
v Superman, I was really hoping that DC could redeem themselves with this, their next comic book movie. I was so wrong. If you have never read any Suicide Squad comics or DC comics in general you are already hopelessly lost here, because the characters aren't exactly top tier. Take Captain Boomerang for example. If you didn't know who he was before, you sure don't know who he is by the end of this movie. But this isn't the only pitfall for this flick, it is actually just one of many. How about the lack of a script? No problem for this director who was also the writer, just play some music and have the actors do random things. This movie was so terrible.
The only thing actually watchable was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Maybe skip this movie and go straight to Birds of Prey.",Suicide Squad
1199,grizzly228,Wasted Potential,6,22 May 2017,"I'm not sure if this includes spoilers so I clicked that it did, just in case something I say is considered a spoiler, though I will try to avoid any.The first and biggest problem with this is the writing. The dialogue is often hokey, and humor falls flat, and the story makes little to no sense. I understand the plot is contrived to get these bad guys together to fight a common enemy. But the pacing is all over, and the villain and her/their scheme is never fully explained.The second big problem is the direction. Some scenes are in dramatic slow motion for no reason and undermine the action and pacing. Other scenes that could have been interesting or exciting are rushed or never even shown. Good direction could have helped cover up a lot of the story's flaws. Instead it exacerbated them.The third big problem, and I guess this still goes along with the writing and plot but stood out to me as a separate problem, the combination of the characters never makes sense. Okay, we get it. They are meta-humans brought together to fight potential meta-human threats. However, some are obviously much more useful than others. Why was Harley Quinn even there? Deadshot kills everything quickly while her and others have hand-held weapons. It makes little sense. At least the alligator dude gets to use his talent later in the story, but for the most part they could have just taken Deadshot, no need for the whole crew.There are a few good points that make this movie worth watching.The actors do the best they can with an inconsistent and disappointing script. Margot Robbie is a believable Harley Quinn unfortunately she's just there for eye candy, contrived emotion, and one-liners that don't land. Will Smith is, well, Will Smith as he is in every movie and does it justice. I have mixed feelings about Jared Leto's joker; on one hand, he is a delightfully psychotic, and somewhat fresh, original twist on the joker. On the other hand his performance is also as inconsistent as the script. Early on, I was digging the character even if it took a minute to get used to after seeing actors like Caesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger do him differently. But some of his later scenes seemed forced, like he was trying to hard. He delves into a Christian Bale-like guttural voice at times that seemed unnecessary. Overall the actors do the best they can with the script and deserve credit.If you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the action and attempts at humor, there is value here. Unfortunately, its potential is wasted by the script as I've said before. A better story, villain, and direction could have made this something special.",Suicide Squad

I wouldn't have mind ""Michael Rowe"" (from the TV series Arrow) to play Deadshot.Those who're comparing it with X-Men Apocalypse, i actually enjoyed it more than the apocalypse.

1205,bubbabubbalicious,So Bad Even Shills Can't Ensure The Truth Won't Get Out,1,14 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a tedious movie. I saw this last night and I've tried to forget it ever since. From the get go, the Suicide Squad anti-heroes are introduced one- by-one. Then, once they're all given their backgrounds and clichéd introductions, they are delivered to their new boss, one . . . by . . . one. This consumes about the first 45 minutes, just before the meaningless action takes place. What's really ironic, More time is spent describing their ironic natures than explaining their first mission. Consequently, their first foray just seems pointless, because it is. The character development was weak and I really didn't care if they came back alive or not.HACK: In a fiction-writing context, the term is used to describe writers who are paid to churn out sensational, lower-quality ""pulp"" fiction such as ""true crime"" novels or action centered ""super hero movies"".Batman Begins (screenplay/director: Christopher Nolan) is a study in character development. Suicide Squad (David Ayer writer/director) is a hack job if there ever was one. And yet it has a 6.9 as I write this, so I see shills at work. Time will water this ""dog"" to it's real valuation, about 4.7 is my guess. I gave it a 1/10 because it's was insultingly bad. PS - Will Smith is interesting as usual, but not nearly enough to recommend this. This movie is a study in rote-cliché, predictable and plodding screenplay development, and extremely poor dialogue. Dead Pool is SO much better, that is if you want to laugh at super heroes.",Suicide Squad
1206,vovietanh,Nothing makes sense at all. I repeat. NO. THING.,1,14 August 2016,"Awful direction and screen writing. This movie is plagued with awkward and anticlimactic scenes. Seriously, can this David Ayer suck less?Making a movie about illogical people is no excuse to deprive it of ANY LOGIC at all.First of all, the non-villain characters are completely unlikeable. Flag and Waller act like condescending scumbag all the time. Waller is worse. She's like begging to be hated in every single scene. Why would David try so hard to make people hate a black woman??The whole disaster of the movie that the Suicide Squad had to fix was caused one of their members - Enchantress. If that project X (that creates the Suicide Squad) was not initiated in the first place, then there'd be no such disaster.Enchantress caused the disaster by releasing her brother, an almighty being that could wipe out the whole city, even the world. However, ever since she was released by June Moore, she had plenty of chances to do that because she could instantly teleport to anywhere. But she ended up waiting all the time. That means she's one of the strongest but also dumbest creatures on Earth.Harley Quinn proved her love to Joker by plunging into tanks of chemical toxic from at least the 5th floor, then was saved by just one kiss full of Joker love.When Waller found out Enchantress betrayed, she stabbed its heart multiple times, but didn't destroy it at all (!!) so that Enchantress could retrieve it later effortlessly and revive. If Waller simply destroyed that heart, the movie wouldn't happen. There were no character development and some characters were treated like trash. Slipknot as a Suicide Squad member appeared just to be killed disgracefully right at the beginning. Boomerang is also an insignificant character because the movie wouldn't change at all with or without him.Joker heroically appeared to save Harley Quinn just to be shot down immediately. Isn't he smart???Enchantress's brother, a Godlike being who devastated a whole city, was killed in an instant with a bomb that barely punched a hole on the ground.Almost all scenes with Waller were unpalatable, awkward, and anticlimactic, especially the ending of the final boss was defeated. Can David Ayer make the lasting moment of his movies less suck???Overall, I can't stand this state of plummeting movie standards anymore.

I can only attribute that to hardcore comic book fans who are blind to it and love anything comic book. What a waste of millions of dollars making this movie. Obviously none of that money went into developing a script or an actual plot line because the movie lacked both. Suicide Squad was never a very popular comic so trying to force this movie was probably a bad idea. All the Jared Leto hype leading into this movie culminated in a huge dud. The lone bright spot was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn but the makers of this movie pretty much wasted her as well. The two words in my summary say all you need to know. JUMBLED MESS!! It's scary to think that there are many more obscure characters from comics that are about to get their own movies and/or TV shows. This movie should be a blueprint for what not to do and it also shows that no matter how much money you throw at a movie if you have the wrong people in charge of making it then it will fail.,Suicide Squad

1210,nickey-matillano,"Suicide Squad, deserving Near Perfect Movie, blundered upon a standard Fun/Action Film",7,6 August 2016,"The movie ladies and gentlemen, was a good fun action-packed summer blockbuster movie. I rate 6.8/10 and most people would agree since I've seen most reviews linger their rating of the film from 6-8/10 tops.Now the ONE thing 90% of the people who has watched the movie, considers that the characters are the foundation of what might have been a FANTASTIC and NEAR PERFECT summer movie (near perfect because every movie has flaws. The characters and the actors portraying them was splendidly impersonated and let me elaborate MY thoughts:STRONG Char:Deathshot: Will Smith DID EXPONENTIALLY well with portraying this comical hit-man character into something that could be his stamp upon the DCU or even in comic film history. The way he acts upon a cliché but reasonable cause is what drives the audience to root for his succession even though he plays the bad guy.Harley Quinn: No need to tell you men, and ladies of chaotic nature, this Crazed, psycho diva is what probably drove the entire film, IF NOT Deathshot himself. Margot Robbie was FAN-TASTICAL in this movie, two words for DC, MMOARRRR PLEEEAAADDDGE!ElDIABLO: Ohhh wow, when I thought they couldn't get any other character to withstand the onslaught of Harley and Deathshot's scenes in the film, I was proved wrong by this Character's involvement throughout the main plot. Jay Hernandez, the actor did an astounding job!Cpt. Boomerang: Being someone in Australia, this guy, played by JAI COURTNEY, the actor that I thought wouldn't deliver to any roles given to him.....actually... delivered. WOW. I was blown away to how renowned he was upon setting this character INTO the DCU, even though ""Australia"" is hardly recognized in the DC comics.Joker: I'm one of those people who loved different variability in individuality. The new take I am fascinated in, AND I CANNOT WAIT for Jared Leto to capture his TRUE Joker moment.Weaker Chars:Killer Croc, this character is actually played by Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje, and if you don't know who that is, he's one of my favorite English actors to date. And although he played as a monster, he actually gets his personality right, JUST WISH WE HAD MORE!Flag: A Tactical Specialist Soldier, nothing too sophisticated to care about really..Dr.June Moone/Enchantress: Possibly what most people hated about this movie, on how the actress Cara Delevingne played her and her STORY progression wasn't reasonably the best and not slightly enforced upon the viewers, she was more of an asset to her own agenda and I never felt the worrying matter for her to come back.Slipknot: What can I say.. this guy was seen to be expendeble when he was the only one without a sophisticated flashback/backstory sequence in the group, HECK even Kitana had a few lines and action. You could say he couldn't ""climb"" out of this one.I'm not going to talk about Amanda Waller, she wasn't the VILLAIN she was suppose to be.The plot point is what hit this film the HARDEST. DCU is faltering with it's story telling, editing and writing. If WB can FIX this and change the way they're making DC films through story, then DCU might pull through the long haul. Suicide Squad was possibly disappointing for fans/critics alike seeing as it was MEANT to be a film of near perfection or at least be CLOSE to being Great film with little flaws, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.And yes, some of the music editing were obnoxious, even to me. Unreasonable placements of irrelevant music was also what killed the movie for some.",Suicide Squad
1211,williamhuds,"Muddled plot, muddled acting, muddled editing.",2,6 August 2016,"This is easily the worst movie I've seen this year. I saw Man of Steel, enjoyed it, Batman vs superman, enjoyed that too. This, this I could not enjoy. The editing is confusing at best, fight scenes make little to no sense, with quick cuts between the violence and characters witnessing it, leading to spatial confusion. People in the know would call this the 180 rule, and they break it, a lot. Moreover, the editors applied a LUT to the film in post. This is clear, as half the film has washed out colors, too dark blacks, and saturation that reminds me of watching movies on a TV from the 90s. What's more is that the acting is very hit or miss. Some scenes are basically Will Smith acting, and the others just phoning in their lines as if it were a rehearsal. Easily Deadhshot is the best part of this mess, as he was the only character even partially fleshed out, or even remotely human. Conversely the antagonist who is revealed during the film is even more of a cluster of confusion than most other aspects, at various points their motivation spans from wanting to destroy humanity for ""worshipping machines"" have mercy on the suicide squad as they are noble fighters, and make a zombie army for reasons I'm still not 100% on. Honestly as a film student I would expect better from another students film. Finally I would like to comment on Harley Quinn, while I am by no means a comic- fundamentalist, this Harley Quinn makes literally no sense, her backstory is explained in what was perhaps a 5 minute scene in which she falls for the joker and is tortured by him in various ways, again for reasons unexplained. Harleys on screen presence was relegated to either making quick jokes about the ensuing action, or to everyone's detriment, weird quirky ""i'm so deep"" comments, which will likely soon be sold on ""Hot Topic"" T-shirts across the nation. All in all, Horrible film, don't see it, don't trust people who say its good.

Everyone's fighting, people are dying, and Marvel hero fights villains while cracking jokes. Totally not cool. Here, in Suicide Squad, we got a bunch of bad guys who don't give a *beep* about what happens to people or anyone, fights the villain cracking jokes, just like Avengers, but it is cool, because they're bad guys and that's what they do. What's so crazy and cool about this movie is that it made me (probably all audience) cheer for the bad guys, for doing bad things, and sometimes good things, too.

I knew it was going to be bad, so that is why I didn't spend any of my money on it, just 2hrs of my time, (which wasn't worth it). After seeing End of Watch and then Fury (I own Fruy on DVD), both of which are ""gritty"" and ""realistic"" D.Ayer fails again to write a good scene. It's his fault his movies suck because I think he thinks he should write good movie scenes, not scenes that look good in a movie. The actors say their lines and they sound like line in a cheesy movie, not authentic or real; they sound like they're written to check off a box. Okay the characters now; I'm sorry to start with the chick with the bat: why is she there other than to have a ""main"" female lead who is not Jennifer Lawrence(which I'm glad she wasn't cast, as she would have made this worse like she did for X-Men)? No superpowers, weight 100lbs, isn't a martial artist, and used to be a psychologist. The Joker was out of place here and made worse by J.Leto's performance: he looks out of place and board; no real need for him to be in the movie other than to have the joker in the movie since the batman makes a cameo. the main story/protagonist is who again? the other chick or the tall Aztec guy? I just lost interest. Oh yeah and the thing the chick with the bat say about kill everyone and escape? How exactly? she weight 100 lbs... surrounded by Navy SeALs? Oh and the black strawberry head thingies? What's with them? Was I supposed to feel frightened or surprised in seeing them? Black strawberry head thingies, really? And the old government chick shoots all her staff and says they're not cleared for this? Weren't they vetted or hired by her? weren't they just working for her? Did I miss something there or was she doing this to be tough because D.Ayer wrote the scene just to show how cold and ruthless she's suppose to be? Somehow the cartoon Amanda Waller from Batman TAS and Superman TAS was portrayed better (I know that was a series and the longer season allows for the development of the character), but this version was badly written and ""fleshed out,"" and acted just as bad (maybe this wasn't Viola's fault, as her performance is guide by the director and he's supposed to make the actor become the person).

1214,tdawgg29,Let's Go Save The World!,9,7 August 2016,"To the fans of the comic book universe... ""Suicide Squad"" is one of the BEST anti-hero film of all time! Each of the character stay true to The New 52 in the DC Entertainment Universe.Will Smith's character Deadshot scores a bull's eye... not one single miss of using his combination of action, comedy, and human drama. Viola Davis (How To Get Away with Murder) is one bad chick in this picture in her role as Amanda Waller... mastermind of the ""skwad"". Australian actress Margot Robbie (Focus) have ultimately stolen this picture (and my heart) as the famed Harley Quinn. Utilizing the Brooklyn accent, attitude, and I-don't-give-a-**** action have truly shined in this film. I hope one day that Robbie will have her SS spin-off starring the famed Clown Princess of Crime. Making her film debut, Japanese-American actress Karen Fukuhara truly kicks butt (and then some) as Katana. She's truly gonna shine in future films to come and I would love to see more of Fukuhara. Finally, there's Jared Leto. As much as I loved Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, the late Heath Ledger, and voice talent Mark Hamill claiming their title as the Joker... Leto have ultimately went full Joker in this picture. Combining his Playboy lifestyle with psychotic and remorseless tone, Leto have truly earned the title as one of the best.This film would have been a perfect score, but lost a point for last minute editing. I was a bit disappointed that some of the scenes from the trailer wasn't in the finalized film and ended up on the cutting room floor. Not only that, I want to see more of The Joker in action. Even Harley's wink at Deadshot wasn't in the film either. I hope that one day that Warner Bros. Pictures would make a Suicide Squad Director's Cut on Blu-Ray soon.Final Judgment: Despite the last minute film editing, Suicide Squad delivers the fun, action, humor, and suspense of The New 52 series that makes you want to beg for more. David Ayer should make an SS sequel one of these days. For now... Suicide Squad scores a 9 out of 10.",Suicide Squad

1216,jhieharmer,No spoilers - Terrible Movie - Once Again,4,16 August 2016,"I have read many of the negative reviews which sum up how bad this movie is. The plot is a mess. The story is terrible. As I watched this movie I started to think of the numerous people who made this movie. They were paid a lot of money to use their expertise to make a great movie. Think of all the hype. Then you watch it...only to discover it is a complete disaster. At my job, my boss demands perfection. Things must be done right or don't do them at all. We all have boss (or leaders) who keep everyone on track and demand a vision based on what is right and meets or exceeds a standard of quality. The makers of this film (and many in Hollywood) just don't care anymore. Why? Because they do not have to. This movie is a pile of garbage but it doesn't matter. The movie will still make millions just with people seeing that it is garbage. People have so much free time, they will waste it watching junk because it has been hyped that you must see it. So the masses will pay to see it. How sad this is? I have some advice for those writers in Hollywood: read Shakespeare and learn the basics of storytelling. Learn what a plot is and demand that is make sense. Demand perfection from yourself and from others. For far too long, mediocre was within budget or just didn't matter to be perfect. You must change this attitude and make things right. Actually care about the product you are creating. At the end of the day, I wouldn't waste my time watching this film.

1217,koishnoish,Exactly what it said on the tin,1,4 August 2016,"For the past couple of days I've been hearing a lot of stuff about this film. I've been very excited for Suicide Squad ever since it was announced, being a bit of a DC Comics fanboy myself, and have thus been keeping up with the film regularly. For the past few days a lot of negative reviews have been thrown at this film and now, after watching it, I don't really understand where all that negativity comes from.Let me just start off by saying that if you're coming into Suicide Squad hoping to get a really deep and interesting story or to see Leto's 'Joker' then you're probably going to be disappointed. That's not to say Leto is bad, despite my fears I actually very much enjoyed Leto's portrayal of 'The Joker', it's just he isn't often present. And that's a good thing, I was genuinely concerned that Leto may take centre stage and was pleased when he didn't.The plot is probably one of the film's weakest points. This plot is a very overused plot by now and especially in superhero flicks. If you're expecting a film full of twists and turns there aren't many here. However, the lack of sophisticated plot feels both justified and adequate to me as instead we are treated to a lot of interaction between the large cast, of mainly unknown characters. I was surprised by just how much characterisation most of the characters received in this film. Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Enchantress, Rick Flag, Captain Boomerang, Katana and El Diablo all get given a glimpse of detailed backstory that helps to develop the characters, some more than others, and it surprised me. Not only is this characterisation surprising to me, but it was also done rather well in my opinion, especially with Deadshot, El Diablo and Harley.The performances in this film are actually all very solid for me. Margot Robbie had a monumental task in bringing one of DC's most beloved villains of recent years to the big screen and she pulls it off pretty perfectly. Viola Davis is a very good Amanda Waller. Will Smith pulls a good amount of weight as Deadshot and he really pulls the role off, despite my worries, all the more fool I. I enjoyed the other characters also, most receiving less screen time but all of them having their moments to shine.The visuals in this film too, are amazing. Some of the scenes with Delevingne's 'Enchantress' are simply amazing just to watch, seeing as that character visually is the most difficult to pull off with the possible exception of El Diablo. The final battle especially, for me, looked amazing. It is very rare for me nowadays to honestly come away from one of these superhero films, Marvel or DC, and say that I saw something new. However, the final battle and the visuals on the main villain really sent chills down my spine, I hadn't quite seen something so intimidating in one of these films yet and it really affected me.The only other thing I think that is worth noting on this film is that the pacing can sometimes feel a little off, especially at the beginning. Most of this I attribute to the main character's introductions and backgrounds and thus I give it a pass. I myself know each and every one of these characters well, but I perfectly understand why the introductions need to be done for those who don't know the universe as well as myself.To round off, I found 'Suicide Squad' to be an extremely enjoyable film. There is nothing truly groundbreaking here, so if that's what you're looking for you will probably be disappointed. Where the film lacks a complex plot it makes up for itself strongly with characters, a wise focus because each and every one of these villains is extremely interesting. If you're going into this film expecting Killer Croc or Katana to steal the show then also be prepared for some disappointment, as the film focuses more on Quinn and Deadshot than the lesser known characters. Regardless, 'Suicide Squad' is still a crazy, insane, fun joyride that asks you to simply sit back and enjoy the show. It's not trying to be complex, it's not trying to blow your mind, it's just trying to give you a good time and for the vast majority of the time, I was extremely content to let the film take me wherever it wanted. Ignore the reviews online and see it for yourself, as long as you sit back and relax you'll have a great time.",Suicide Squad
1218,theresews,Much potential but so wrongly executed,4,6 September 2016,"I was, as much as everybody else, very hyped to watch ""Suicide squad"". I had been watching previews and trailers since last winter and been eagerly waiting for a new spin on the endless parade of super-hero movies. However, I must confess myself bitterly disappointed. There is a number of problems with this film. 1. The super-villains are not evil enough. From the get-go of the movie, we are presented to the different villains, who are all imprisoned. And the first mistake that ""suicide squad"" makes is already within its first five minutes. It presents its villains as oppressed and mistreated prisoners. They are shown being beat up, electrocuted and served horrible food. And it creates a sort of sympathy for the characters, that you don't really want to feel, because these people are supposed to be the evilest of the evil. But instead the movie shows you, that there are actually some, that are more evil - prison guards. And the same story goes throughout the movie, as we see these super-villains (who are not really THAT evil) transforming more into super-heroes.2. Too many characters (!) I understand that DC wishes to create a new superhero-franchise and universe, but this movie just reeks of a wish to jump-start this whole thing and create a lot of action-figures and merchandise, along with a sloppiness towards giving their characters real personality. You cant, I repeat, you CAN'T introduce seven new super-villains/heroes all-in-one and meanwhile create a realistic character-development for each of them and meanwhile have an interesting action-story-line. A lot of the movie falls to the ground because there is simply too much going on. And it's a shame, because Margot Robbie, Will Smith and Jared Leto do a very decent job with their characters. Had DC only decided to kick-start the franchise with these three (and maybe El Diablo too) and then afterwards added the rest in sequels, they could have had a very strong team of characters. But you aren't allowed to enjoy the performances of these aforementioned actors, because they are constantly interrupted by other characters, which you don't care about seeing or hearing. 3. It is NOT a new spin on the endless parade of super-hero movies. Basically, it unfolds itself much like the first ""Avengers"" in the overall story-line. We are introduced to a group of misfits, who are forced to work together to fight a villain, who one of them is guilty of unleashing. Despite some internal disputes, they are able to overcome their differences and become some sort of friends. Then they fight a whole lot of alien- looking creatures and destroy a city before the character, who all along promised to be the one least invested in the project decides to give an ultimate sacrifice to give the others opportunity to save the world. 4. Cringe dialogue and non-believable friendships. This goes hand-in-hand with the fact that the super-villains in this movie just aren't evil. Otherwise, Deadshot would have had no problem killing Harley Quinn (whom he had known for like one day) in exchange for his life and daughter back. Furthermore, the dialogue is at some points just toe-curling. From Amanda Waller's line ""Go get it girl"", to El Diablos declaration that ""he has already lost one family, he won't lose another"", when he never at any point appeared to have any real connection to any of the team-members. This problem also originates from the ""too many characters""-problem. In the end, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and Will Smith earns this movie a star each and then another star is awarded for beautiful special effects. But this movie does not amount to more than that.",Suicide Squad
1219,henry-bernhagen,"A Simple Pros & Cons List - No Spoilers - ""What's with DC and Instant Friendships?""",5,8 August 2016,"*Just like the film, this review is NOT bound or subject to the original Suicide Squad comics. They are different, and that is okay.CONS: A ""Trailer Movie"" - most of the film seems like it was made for the gazillions of trailers that were released. It's never good when 40%-50% of the film feels like something you've already seen in a commercial. Not only that, but it all felt as if it were just a trailer for upcoming solo films/Justice League. Marketing did a phenomenal job with this film. Run-of-the-Mill Conflict/Story Arc - SOOOOOO yawn-worthy. A completely generic, factory-produced superhero conflict/story arc/antagonist in an already superhero-saturated Hollywood. They really need to start considering more creative angles with this stuff. Sympathy for psychopaths? - the director definitely was trying to make the audience ""feel bad"" for Harley Quinn and the Joker. Anyone else find that strangely uncomfortable? Corny/Immature Script - pretty self-explanatory. Movie lacked any intellectual conversation/humor, seemed like it was written to entertain a group of (PG-)13 year olds. Diablo - an ""eh"" character who's actions are totally predictable. What's with DC and Instant Friendships? - did anyone else notice that the characters had absolutely minimal personal interaction before they started saying dumb stuff like ""no one hurts my friends!"" (or whatever). Reminds me of another major DC movie that came out earlier this year... *sips tea* Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Reigns Superior - this movie felt like DC's attempt to top GotG, by using 'grittiness' as the competitive factor. Unfortunately (if this were their true intention), only an R rated Suicide Squad would have had the potential to dethrone the group-superhero king. Serious Pacing Issues - not that the pacing was fast, but it was disorganized. Fast then slow then flashback then action then flashback etc.PROS: Harley Quinn's Portrayal, Motives & Background - as expected, Margot Robbie nailed this performance. Not to mention, they actually did a spectacular job depicting Harley Quinn's involvement with the Joker and her true, deepest desires (that scene was SO good & kinda sad). The Joker - they succeeded in their quest to introduce a new, unique, spectacle of a Joker, and Jared Leto was envelopingly creepy. His new portrayal of being a 'gangster-ish' villain is a nice twist on the character, but they didn't demonstrate enough reasons for why people should actually FEAR him. I'm sure this will be addressed in future films, though. Batman V Deadshot - okay maybe this is my wildcard, but I thought they set-up this inter-character conflict in a suspenseful, interesting manner. I'm definitely looking forward to future interactions between the two.  Continues More Fluent Universe than Marvel CU - Suicide Squad was very fluent, in that it kept the continuity of the DC Universe more clean and organized than the muddled/permeated Marvel CU. Good Soundtrack - a great mix of modern music with gritty twists/remixes; some sequences had a ""Great Gatsby (2013)"" feel to it, which is always a good thing.OVERALL:Suicide Squad was a marketing-based film. More effort/creativity went into the advertising rather than the production itself. Regardless, it was fun-to-watch and had its bright moments.",Suicide Squad
1220,litchy03,Good fun popcorn flick,8,4 August 2016,Suicide Squad is a great action packed fun popcorn movie. The critics out there that are expecting a cinematic masterpiece from a come book film should not be critics. As David Ayer (Director) has stated he made this film for the fans and I believe if you are a fan of comic book films and a DC fan you will really enjoy this film. Margot Robbie stole the spotlight in the film with other great actors like Will smith and Jai Courtney were also very good. Jarrod Leto's Joker was different but still very good. The story is plain and simple which is what the film needed with such a large cast and the villain was a great choice. If you enjoy a good action film with interesting characters you will enjoy this film.,Suicide Squad
1221,alfred-verhoeven,Plot? What plot?,3,23 December 2016,"Sure, I like a good superhero movie as much as the next guy, but this one sucked big time from start to finish. It was as if they had cut out half the movie, not looking at the story line. Strange twists (as in ""unlikely"", not as in funny or exciting), weird actions, no credible mission. A very unlikely plot (& an Aussie burglar is a superhero??? In which universe?). Will Smith is OK, and so is Margot Robbie, but what is this movie about? The heart of ancient which from a cave? And her brother? I don't think any script writers were involved whatsoever. Nope, some nice acting and special effects, but only 3 points for trying (out of 10). Next!",Suicide Squad
1222,ebamovies,Would have worked better as a Sequel...Maybe to a standalone Batman film,6,10 August 2016,"First I want to start by asking why did Ayer have a small moment of appreciation for Snyder, by having a giant smily face for 2 secs...Thanks for reminding us that Snyder still has DC Comic movies by the ""balls""... The good parts : Harley: overall justice has been done to the character by the actress Katana: Interesting addition and well played ElDiablo: I always enjoy watching Jay H. as he is a pretty good actor. The OK parts: Joker:Comparing any Jokers or ""J""s to Ledgers is not fun anymore, as nobody will bring the same level of intensity and non-chalant-ness to CHAOS as he did. But Leto's J is interesting, different and weird in a comic way. I didn't get much violence out of him except that he robs and shoots...but jumping into Acid.....again...if this was a Batman film where we see that J is super in love with Harley...we would appreciate Leto's sadness and overall depressive state in this movie more..than we did... THE BAD::::: Why open with 2 main characters, then give us the credits and then tell us the story....only to then go back and tell us more about the other Squad members? So if Enchantress was so bad and evil and pretty powerful...why just have her hang around as a human...And if June Moone(seriously??) hates being Ench. so much...how can she wake up one moment and want to say it...? Ench. could leave the room and go to Iran...but she couldn't leave the room and go to Amanda to pick her ""heart"" up... And her brother seems pretty cool too...wouldn't you want to warn everyone involved to watch out for scary brothers...and probably not keep his doll in a small room hanging out on his own... This is one of the few movies that reveal the villain in the 1st 10 minutes of the film. OK ...with Fant4, we all know that Doom is coming... And this film is the 2nd most recent superhero movie that cheats the fans by picking a villain from the list of already present people. Last one was Avengers and made Loki the bad guy... Will Smith: He still acts like a stick and has either very emotional moments with watering eyes...or dumb way of delivering the already bad Dr.Phil jokes.. Who shot at the helicopter that brought them down into the city... Why bring slingshot only to get rid of him after 5 minutes? The first part of the movie is about MetaHumans...but Harley, DShot,Boomer and sling are not meta...just human... Ench. EVIL DANCE during the whole last scene...why did she look like she needed to PEE? And yes...going back to the start..This movie would have worked better and make so much more sense if it were a sequel to a Batman movie...or SSquad 1....Instead of watching rushed flashbacks, rushed action scenes and no real set up as the set up was already ruined by ComicCon trailer...Perhaps David Ayers talent was shown in the my favorite part of the film...ElDiablo.. as Ayer is best at capturing the ghetto and gangster characters in all of his films...he did it again here...but the rest of the film...not so much.",Suicide Squad
1223,santerixdxd,Positively surprised after all,5,3 August 2016,"I came with low to none expectations at all, I was positively surprised when there was so much to love. Letos Joker was something new, it was like a combination of Ledger and something completely new. Voice was clearly the thing combining his and Ledgers Joker but the facial expressions and habits are something i've never seen on screen before. Lets just say that he nailed it, but so did Ben Affleck, Margot Robbie and even Will Smith (I was a bit skeptical about him at first)The biggest let down for me was the villain, just so so bad. She (Enchantress played by Cara Delevingne) was so laughable, couldn't take her seriously I tried I swear. Sadly just like every DC movie from MoS to this has had a weak ending, they all started of so great and had the greatest point just before the intended finale/high point.If the ending is ignored this is a great movie, even if it isn't The Dark Knight or Civil War of movies.",Suicide Squad
1224,duducomo-901-361481,"Not as bad as the critics or the review, instead an interesting movie",8,27 November 2016,"It's not a masterpiece, it's not even close to the big names as The Dark Knight, but not a cataclysm as Batman v Superman. To start, this is a movie...and a movie is categorized as Entertainment and art, right? It was entertaining? Really, I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end! It was artistic? Neah, no complex plots, no psychological tension or something like that, it has great special effects and after all is superhero / supervillain movie. I gave it 9 because it was a rad and Margot Robbie was legendary as Harley Quinn, she saved the movie actually, with her sexy, girly, comic, crazy and sentimental self. PRO: -Harley Quinn was a strong character which brought something refreshing to the movie world, it's actually one of my favorite takes on DC characters, with Heath Ledger's Joker and Christian Bale' Batman/Dark Knight; -will smith played well dead shoot, as a good counterbalance to the crazy Harley Quinn with his calm, thoughtful side; -yeah, their chemistry; -the crazy romance between Joker and Harley; -some great special effects. CONS: -as a normal person in front of the TV, you won't sense most of them, but they are clear after second watch and network reviews -the plot is messed up and predictable, it's Bond movies level of bad actually, more like cartoons. But why is that? To start, the villains are good for nothing, they are killed too easily, it's like a game on very very easy difficulty. In half of the movie you are thinking where are they going in reality because the 'Suicide Squad' walks like a high school trip with a lot of talk. Aside from the Harley and Deadshoot and Enchantress the rest of the load of characters are poor described; -I don't like they way Joker was played, it was too irrational, extreme and weird, with no psychological depth like in the Dark Knight, but more of a crazy clown with weird iron teeth(it looked like iron, maybe I'm wrong); -please please,Ben Affleck, give up! You have destroyed the Batman v Superman movie with your violent, irascible, hot-headed take with no morals, you look more like a supervillain than a superhero, if you want to see some good stuff look at Christopher Nolan's Batman/Dark Knight series. If it wouldn't been for Margot Robbie which saved the movie with her witty character, the movie would have been a disaster, she deserves a statue from the directing team which build the most messed up plot I ever seen in an expensive movie.

Everyone that voted high for this movie is insulting other movies that actually deserves a good rating. This movie reminded me of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. At least some people were fooled for awhile till some time passed for them to realize it was a mistake.Gave this two stars... one because I like Margot Robbie and two for the effort of trying to making a good DC movie, even though they failed miserably.Come on DC, you need to catch up to Marvel.",Suicide Squad

Two things, I liked so much. One is Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Queen. Perfect selection from the cast. Next one is, Music and Soundtrack awesome.

1228,nanda_tapias,Absolutely amazing! A MUST-WATCH!,10,4 August 2016,"I hardly ever do reviews, but after hearing some misplaced criticism i see myself compelled to defend this movie. First of all, the acting is absolutely outstanding. I must admit I did not know what to expect from so many crazy characters but it definitely worked. Jared Letto did an amazing Joker, he was like a mafia boss all psychotic, plus the introduction of a love interest (Harley Quinn) added much to the plot. Margo Robbie, Will Smith and Jai Courtney were incredibly funny. The rest of the characters were also great but the 4 mentioned above really stole the spotlight. The characters are incredibly interesting, and I would like to see a movie focused of each of them. The only character i thought was a bit of an extra that (for me) kinda ruined the vibe was the Japanese sword woman (but she doesn't appear that much). Also, the plot was also very well formed and made sense, it was well put together. Yes, there's like half an hour dedicated to character introduction, but honestly, the characters are the essence of the movie (which is why it's so good). In addition, The movie is just hilarious. I laughed all the time, the characters are just so charismatic. I don't get why people hate on the movie. It's FANTASTIC. Seriously... go watch it.",Suicide Squad

Considering the cast seemed strong, I wasn't expecting any stupidity in the movie like I didn't in the first two parts of the iron-man but slightly disappointed afterwards. From the trailers, I was expecting Harley Quinn as this really strong character comprising of crazy hotness & cunning intelligence but halfway through it she suddenly turned into a dumb blonde teenager. Lastly, the enchantress role was horribly depicted by the end. The weird animated dance seemed more like an organism from a cartoon than a witch, wth was that? I'm specifically pointing the dance out because it seriously weird-ed me out. And lastly, how can bombs end a magic spell radiating from the ground to the skies?!?! Was it even a magic spell, or some sort of alien invasion because hey we were told she was centuries old witch?! Should've been another plot for the end.",Suicide Squad
1230,dantheman116,Worst movie ever,1,2 February 2017,I am going to keep this short and sweet. If not the worst film in 2016 probably the worst film to come out in my lifetime and I'm 26! it makes batman vs superman Oscar worthy in comparison. Its so bad that its almost as if the movie was a fan made video made on YouTube. they are killing great dc comics when will they learn.I never write reviews but this one I FELT COMPELLED TO SO NO ONE WASTES THEIR MONEY OR TIME.And I've checked that they will be making another one in 2019 if it's anything like that and with the same cast then I don't want to know too be brutally honest.Will Smith will be re-watching that and shaking his head in embarrassment.,Suicide Squad
1231,Decker187,If You've Watched The Trailers...,4,11 August 2016,"If you've seen any of the trailers for this movie, then you've already seen the best parts. There are so many things wrong with this film, I don't know where to begin. Horrible dialogue, mediocre effects, baffling cinematography, confusing editing, even the sound effects and music made one cringe. Then there are some moments in the film that make you want to slink down in your seat in shame. When The Enchantress started doing her belly dance I forgot all about her threat to humanity and instead struggled to keep from laughing out loud. The dialogue from all of the characters, except The Joker, was downright shameful. Margo Robbie probably had it worst of all. The ""what is everyone looking at"" attitude and ""yes, I'm crazy, so deal with it"" repetitiveness wore thin quickly. And you would think that an actor that can command the bucks like Will Smith can, well, there's simply no excuse. Here come the spoilers: The Joker is NOT part of the Suicide Squad. The villain IS, but instead of participating in their mission, she's the reason for it. One of the previously unmentioned members (Slipknot) shows up out of a clear blue sky and is promptly decapitated for his good deed. Boomerang turns out to be one of those guys that privately likes to talk OTHER people into resisting authority figures, but publicly he either backs down or screws the pooch for those that are really serious. Diablo has become a pacifist, but is the one who finally defeats the villain in the end. We're supposed to believe that Deadshot's weakness is his love for his daughter and yet, when he's given a choice between killing Harley Quinn or his daughter, he chooses his daughter. What? Yes, you heard it right. Literally or figuratively, it makes no difference. No one thought of this, or if they did, it never made it to the screen: Deadshot shoots the rope, thereby freeing Harley to plummet to her own fate , AND convincing authority figures that he at least tried. Or, when The Joker suddenly realizes that Deadshot is about to blow his girlfriend away, he flips a switch and the rope she's dangling from suddenly becomes a Bungee cord that smoothly extends and gently lowers Harley safely to the ground. Of course this causes The Joker to laugh hysterically. The scene in the trailers where The Joker says ""I'm not gonna kill ya, I'm just gonna hurt ya really, really bad."" is NOT being said to some helpless kidnapped victim (you know what I mean), but to his one and only true love Harley Quinn herself. I suppose it's to make her more dateable? The Joker's car is cool. For about 30 seconds before it plummets into the water. And where are all of the counter-Batman gadgets located in said car? And why does The Joker leave Harley for dead after said plummet, but can't brace himself (in a flashback) to leave her for dead after she plummets into another unwholesome body of water? Are those perpetual tattooed tears real or not? The military commander's bodyguard. If the time ever comes when she has to defend herself or the commander from the unsavory characters they are both forced to share company with, and who are all mostly heavily armed or ""gifted"" in some extreme way, she will have to do so with...a sword. In one scene we're shown that several if not All of the nano explosives implanted in the necks of the Squad members have been deactivated by The Joker, but at the end their ""Boss"" threatens to explode said explosives if they don't continue to obey her orders.All of this nonsense goes on for about 2 hours, from beginning to end, and at no point is the viewer allowed to identify with or ""get to know"" any of the characters in any meaningful way. It's not that they don't try, the attempt simply fails. What one is left with is a great title, some talented actors strangled by a disastrous script, and a slow but building anger and frustration at the realization that everyone involved in this fiasco simply ""blew it"". Marvel, pass Go and collect 200 dollars. DC, take two steps back and pay the hotel owners each 2 thousand dollars. Or at least refund the cost of the ticket.",Suicide Squad
1232,sHabbadooo,"Apparently it's good to be bad, should be DC's tagline",1,9 August 2016,"Where to start, where to start? This is probably the main problem of the DCU at the moment. They're playing catchup to Marvel, they see Avengers they want in. The problem is, Marvel have spent 4,5 & 6 movies setting it up. We care if Cap gets hurt, we understand the Hulks turmoil and we saw Starks motivation for donning the suit. But here we're introduced to a whole new cast, backstory and all, in 30 mins tops. It just doesn't work, it's rushed, it's lazy and it has no effect in making the audience care about these characters; which in a movie where the stakes are so high, does not bode well. So here's what I thought of each character:Will Smiths Deadshot - has by far the most screen time and manages to annoy in every single scene. He hits all the clichés, slo-mo gun catch, CHECK. Says the movie title, CHECK. Even when he's playing a cold blooded assassin, he's a good guy. Rating 2/10Margot Robbies Harley Quinn - looks the part, has the voice, has the insanity. It works well. Some of the jokes miss and some of her stuff is very repetitive but she's the best of a bad bunch (pun intended) Rating 7/10 (let down by the writing, she's great as Harley)Jai Courtney's Boomerang - here's something I never thought I'd write. Jai Courtney acted well in this film. Criminally underused, could have been such a Deadpool-esque self aware character but again the writing (and Will Smiths screen time) sold him short. Rating 6/10Jay Hernandez El Diablo - starts off boring, does some fire stuff and some CGI stuff. Lame. Rating 3/10Viola Davis Amanda Waller - the best part of this film, even if her motivation is kind of all over the place. She's menacing, but justifies it. Rating 9/10Cara D Enchantress - Abysmal. She can't act, simple as. Why she got the job is beyond me. She's monotone, she has no emotion, she just can't act. Stop. Stop giving her parts. She's awful. Rating 0/10Joel K Rick Flag - Insipid. Boring. Tom Hardy would have been miles better. But I wouldn't want to hurt his career by being in this trash. Rating 2/10Killer Croc 4/10 pointlessKatana 3/10 pointlessSlipknot 0/10 pointlessBatman 0/10 pointless (just in it so he can be in the trailer and sell more tickets)Jared Leto Joker - Pointless. Again only for the trailer to sell tickets. He's weird, he's creepy, but he is NOT the Joker. He's Scarface with mental problems and a fetish for tattoos. They used very similar imagery to Heath Ledgers in some scenes. But then went batshit crazy (pun intended) in others. Unlike Heaths Joker who had a clear plan of just wanting chaos, this Joker is just meh. Take him out of the scenes he's in and it wouldn't change the scene, take his scenes out of the movie and it wouldn't change the movie. He's hardly in it but he gets a 10/10 for disappointing in every scene he's in. Rating -10/10Finally, it wants to be the avengers, it wants to be Guardians of the Galaxy, it wants to be the Dark Knight, it wants to be Deadpool, in the end it was just another DCU film.

The only part of the first 30 minutes I could say I truly liked was seeing Harley Quinn in her original costume, dancing with the Joker like on the cover of Batman: Harley Quinn #1 when she was first introduced in the comics. If you were uneasy about Margot Robbie's portrayal of her, the first few scenes with her do not help change your mind. I went into the theater absolutely hating every scene in the trailer with Harley Quinn. My problem is they rushed her origin, creating her out immediately to be maniacally in love with ""Mr. J"", so we never got to see her as a brilliant therapist, truly trying to save a mad man before eventually going insane herself. I wanted to like Jared Leto, he looked pretty awesome but that's about all I can say. Both him and Robbie were all over the place with their portrayals, and not in a good way. I am glad they went back later in the movie to fill in gaps of Harley's slap chop origin.For some reason they decided to give Captain Boomerang a secret unicorn obsession, not canon to my knowledge, but it was a funny enough gag that I'll let it slide despite copying Deadpool. Slip Knot, oh boy do I feel bad for Adam Beach and the five dollars they paid him to say five words. I was hoping he'd have some kind of moment where someone could say ""Hey that's kinda cool"" but no. When Amanda Waller is going through her book of villains, she doesn't even mention him.Now the best part of this movie was Batman, which is saying a lot because he's only in the movie for three or four scenes. Will Smith was good as Deadshot. Katana was cool and Croc had moments, but I can't say his one-liners actually made me laugh. I think the only one doing any laughing in the theater was the Joker. Okay big spoiler lets go: Ayer makes you think the Joker is dead. Yes my friends he Snydered us. What is with these directors? Because seriously, Snyder decided to ""kill"" the greatest comic book hero of all time, and Ayer decided to ""kill"" the greatest comic book villain of all time. But if you're going to do something like that, go through with it and let us strangle you with Slipknot's ropes, I mean he's not using them. Just like dirt rising on a coffin, Ayer decides to reveal Mr. J isn't dead at the end of the movie, roll credits.But what angered me more than all of that, when introducing the characters, they used the title slides from the commercials (making me have to read), and on Harley Quinn's it said that she killed Robin! Ayer disrespected the comics. Okay so I'm sure they only said this to make us see Harley Quinn as a real threat, which she was because she was the biggest reason for me hating this movie. And it might have not been a problem but they made her the star. The scene where she smashed the window and stole the purse was out of place and unnecessary. Don't make a Harley Quinn movie because this was it.Last thoughts, villain was throw away, plot was garbage, Viola Davis was a great Amanda Waller, Hernadez's El Diablo brought more emotion to the movie, and most of the music ruined the mood and felt out of place even though they used classic rock songs. You should go see this movie and form your own opinion, or don't because the more money Warner Bros and DC Comics get, the more awful movies they'll make.",Suicide Squad
1239,chanson-90775,How Did This Get Such Bad Reviews??,6,6 August 2016,"I do not understand how this got bad reviews at all! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I am super harsh on any type of film. This movie did have its problems, as almost all movies do, but I thought that this film was awesome!First off, the cast could not have been better. Margot Robbie nails her role as Harley Quinn and I really do hope that she gets her own movie in the future. Viola Davis really made you hate her character (Amanda Waller), which means she did a fantastic job as well. Will Smith also did a great job as Deadshot, and he really carried the film (along with Robbie). The best part of the film, however, was Jared Leto as the Joker. Seriously, I could not have been more pleased with the way the Joker was portrayed. I do feel like they should've included him more in the movie though. I keep reading that people are unhappy with the Joker now, and I think that's just because they are either biased against Leto, kidding themselves, or comparing him to Heath Ledger. Leto didn't try to be like Ledger at all, and yet was thoroughly creepy and I feel like he did a fantastic job. I hope to see him in future films from DC (especially if he's in the Batman movie directed by Ben Affleck). Like I said, there are some problems with the film. Cara Delevingne did fine as the Enchantress at the beginning, but the way they handled her character towards the end of the film was just stupid. The ending scene didn't feel like the rest of the film. Her corny lines ruined the scene (along with Rick Flag's lines). I think that the editing of the film felt disjointed in some places. One scene would be super dark and depressing, then the next everyone would be joking around. The film is saved at the end by the surprise ending with Harley and the Joker. Overall though, this film was extremely entertaining and I would definitely see it again. The score is also fantastic. I'm so surprised that it got only like a 29% on RT. I don't understand how a movie like this can score so low, but yet a movie such as Iron Man 2 or Captain America 1 can get like 75%. Those films were absolutely terrible. Critics were way too harsh on this movie. Don't listen to them! Go see it and make your own opinion.Pros of the Film: -Margot Robbie, Will Smith, and Viola Davis all are fantastic in their roles.-Cameos from Batman and the Flash-Side characters are great! (Boomerang, Katana, El Diablo, Killer Croc), sort of wish they were in it more.-Soundtrack and Score-The Joker!!!!-Entertaining and fast paced throughoutCons of the Film: -The Enchantress (at the end), also Rick Flag and Slipknot (why was he in this film?)-Corny lines at the end-Editing in some partsI would give this movie about a 7.5, but since critics were too harsh, I'll give it a solid 8/10",Suicide Squad

1241,shohoku-23686,An interesting and fun movie but has its own problems,6,11 August 2016,"When can DC films smash Marvels' has been a question asked for a long time, and I've put much anticipation in the summer blockbuster Suicide Squad. Overall the movie is fun and easy to watch, actions scenes were fabulous, yet there are some problems that outweigh the goods.The music in the film is one of the greatest things. The soundtracks were totally awesome, especially the iconic ""Purple Lamborghini"", ""Heathens"", ""Gangsta"" etc. Also the original music score conducted by Steven Price works surprisingly well with the soundtrack. The timing of each track was perfect. They suit each characters and each scene, stirring up audience's excitement and anticipation of what will happen next.The characters were another awesome part of the film. Although having many characters to introduce, I reckon the film had done a good job to help the audience who are not familiar with these comic characters, and each character was full of live and emotions. These ""super villains"" background stories were mind-blowing, and the humanisation of them had made the audience (at least me) able to relate to them more. However, same characters' appearance had raised questions. Does Joker really need to be in this film? I understand that it is necessary to have Mr. J in order to introduce Harley, but the scene of him were just not enough, making him looked just like a random, unimportant guy. More Joker or no Joker please. It is really excited to see the Flash in Suicide Squad especially that his is going to be in the future DC films, but it is really confusing for those who are not familiar to DC universe, and pose the question if he is really necessary to be there. And I personally think that characters in Suicide Squad need more time for their background stories and more time to explain why and how the Task Force X is resembled, and it will be better if Suicide Squad is made as a TV series.The edit and too many cut scenes were the parts that made the film less impressive. The plot was simple and easy to follow. Join the task force, rescue target defeat the bad guy or you will die. But the edit is just so jumpy, cutting the flow of the story. And about the cut scenes, I understand that the director must had them cut for a reason, but even before reading about the articles about them I can still see that there are something missing. The worst part is the villain, or villains. The reason for them to turn into villains was just ridiculous! You wanna destroy the world just because people don't worship you anymore? Think about those sad, puny gods in the Nightside Series! (by Simon Green btw), and what spell (or machine) you're creating to destroy the world? The film just skips it without any explanation. Also, please if you have super power, why don't you just use it? Why you need to fight with freaking swords? What I can't stand the most is that she stands there for the whole time and move like a seaweed, what happen to that?!Anyways, Suicide Squad was an entertaining and fun film to watch. Some parts need more improvement, and really hope to see those cut scenes in the extended version.",Suicide Squad
1242,noah_morningstar,disappointing plot less movie,1,12 August 2016,"This was huge shocking surprise. I had high hopes for this, and I was extremely disappointed. The movie had its own style but it fell apart. The plot was almost absent. Very little story, and when there's one it felt a highlight of a story rather than a real one.Hence, the scenes felt rushed, it is kind of a collage of scenes and soundtracks and misplaced music.The actors are well cast, their portrayal of the iconic villains is spot-on but it's wasted in this movie. I respect the style of this movie and the risk they took, but the movie as a whole was surprisingly boring and poorly executed. The idea is there but the story isn't. I definitely didn't see this coming, but ""Suicide Squad"" is neither the movie we wanted nor the movie we deserved (pun intended).",Suicide Squad
1243,HarleenQuinzel16,great movie just wish it went for longer.,7,7 August 2016,"After hearing all the bad reviews about suicide squad i was starting to think that it was not all that it was made out to be, but after then watching the movie i do not understand what would make people say those things about the movie. To start of i should say that i think everyone should go and the see this movie as soon as possible. If you have not heard of suicide squad before it about a group of Gotham's worst villains who are taken out of the prison they are currently in to get a second chance to help man- kind by using their mega- human powers for good. By becoming a team (suicide squad as they call it.) they can fight off more powerful villains like superman if he had decided to be evil but as they find out the government wants no part in it and if anything goes wrong they are ready to throw the team under the bus if it means no bad press.Reasons i think everyone should see it: Where do i start there are so many good thing about this movie like for starters Harley Quinn is finally in a movie. Harley Quinn is played my margot Robbie who did an amazing job with this part she absolutely killed the role her acting was great and i don't think they could of ever got someone better to play Harley Quinn. will smith did a great job with deadshot as well but i wouldn't say it was all that different to the other roles will smith has played over the years, still good but pretty basic. I think the actor who really stole the spotlight was Jared leto (the joker), i am not usually a Jared leto fan but in this case i am. Ever since i heard who was playing the joker i have been wanting to see his performance he has big shoes to fill after heath ledger in the dark knight and jack Nicholson in batman but Jared leto did not disappoint his performance was spectacular the best joker yet in my opinion the only downside was he wasn't in the movie enough for my liking. The costumes where another thing i loved Harley Quinn's costume was a change from the comic book costume but still good, the costume really showed her personality and looked like how i imaged it would feel to be Harley with the bright eyeshadow and the smudged make up, and who can forget the jacket that reads 'property of the joker' what i thought really topped it all of was the baseball bat, still staying true to the original character by giving her an unusual weapon instead of just giving her a gun or something normal. The joker's costume was something else completely, still with the green hair and purple jacket but this time with a twist, the joker had tattoos all over his body of faces and smiles and things that you would guess the joker would have, his costumes was great too this time looking more like a gangster then a clown. Over all i think the movie was amazing i give 10/10 and if a second movie comes out i will be the first in line for tickets.",Suicide Squad

There were some plot holes but still. Harley was bad ass. Deadshot was perfect. Amanda Waller was just amazing and el diablo surprised me. The thing I hated about the movie is Joker. The joker was awesome and that's why it sucked. He has like 15 minutes screen time. I want to see more joker and I hope DC fixes this.

1248,sarahmac-97969,I just flat out hated it,1,7 August 2016,"PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE! The whole movie is so choppy that there is absolutely no flow, and every time a new character is introduced it looks like a bunch of random facts you'd find on a trading card. The flow of the movie is so choppy and ugly that i started praying for it to be over after like 20 minutes. There are amazing songs in this movie that get to play for 30 seconds and suddenly there's another song playing and its really weird. The whole plot is a complete mess and i cringed every time Enchantress and her weird brother talked in their weird language about their weird plans for world domination or...something like that. She was awkwardly gyrating while delivering her lines and it was so awkward i just had to laugh because i wasn't sure what else to do. This movie sounded like it was written by middle schoolers who had 3 hours to write a superhero script but had no ideas who the characters were. The only good thing about this movie was Viola Davis, and her story barely made sense. Will Smith was the only funny thing, and Margot Robbie clearly worked really hard on her character but i don't think anyone could successfully pull off this trash of a script. The battle between the squad and the faceless zombie like army is a waste of time, much like Slingshot or whatever that guys name was. The movie should have just been called ""Harley Quinn and Deadshot: Dawn of F*** This"" and probably would have included more than about 13 minutes of the Joker. For all the hype around Jared Leto, he was just super weird and didn't really bring anything memorable to the movie. I thought Leto and Robbie both did their best, but this movie made the Harley/Joker romance so cringeworthy it was unwatchable. And I'll agree that she looks fantastic but we could do with less close ups of her ass. The final battle was so terrible that i left to go watch Nine Lives, because even a horrible talking cat movie had to be better than the CGI barf all over the screen. Positives: some funny moments, a few good performances, one or two good action sequences, and a cast that obviously did their best when they could. Negatives: horrible writing, horrible villain, jumbled plot, messy transitions, awful CGI, too many cringeworthy scenes to count, and absolutely no fun. I personally love superhero movies, and I'm a huge fan of the MCU and was very excited for this one. But when one of the main members of the squad died, i literally didn't care at all. I was actually disappointed that the bomb didn't destroy everyone else and therefore end the movie. Having seen the Fantastic Four movie i didn't think a superhero squad could ever be that bad again. But after hearing reviews and going in with low expectations while hoping to be pleasantly surprised, i somehow ended up even more disappointed. I cant even explain how truly horrible this movie is and how much of a let down it must be to those who loved this comic and didn't get to see their live action dreams come true. This movie was supposed to be a redemption for Zack Snyder and the people in charge of the DCU but its probably the worst film they could have ever made. I laughed more when someone in our theater called King Kong ""Harambe"" during the Skull Island trailer than i did throughout this entire movie. If you see this movie and like it, i applaud you. If you haven't seen it yet and you're kind of on the fence, consider this review a warning. I would only recommend this movie to the blind and deaf interested in a fun night out",Suicide Squad
1249,gprishan,A decent movie,6,14 August 2016,The hype behind this film was incredible and especially after the not so hot Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice movie that was previously launched by DC Comics.People were hoping that this would be the movie to jump start new life into the DC Comics movie universe and maybe start to become more competitive with the Marvel Comics hugely successful movie franchise and unfortunately this movie didn't make the cut.This movie had a lot to live up to but undoubtedly could not live up to the expectations of the public.Saying that however this movie isn't a complete waste of time. I don't regret watching it but i do however have to say that Dc Comics have a lot to catch up on.Batman is featured in this film and I do feel that Ben Affleck is growing on me as batman.Ben Affleck should however be given his own stand alone Batman movie so that the public is able to better grasp the type of Batman he is trying to portray.Suicide Squad gives us the back stories of the characters in this film with some characters getting a bigger back story than others.The Joker in this film didn't work really well as they tried to make him too cliché.The story line in this movie was confusing and jumped around too much. There was no real direction and the movie was more focused on Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The characters in this movie also struggled with their identity and when the movie was coming to a close the end scene didn't really need to happen.It was good that they still let the audience know that The Joker is alive but they could have done that in another way that could have lead to a much more interesting sequel.The film was of a low standard with maybe a fresh group of writers and a new director helping the film reach that new level.,Suicide Squad

I forgive everyone working on the story in that case. OK that was just me reviewing it. Now I'm going to rant on the Joker as a comic book fan.The Joker is not The Joker. He looks horrible, Joker doesn't act like this, and he loves Harley. So I'm kind of happy that he got six minutes of screen time.3.1/10 (Really bad) Worse than Batman v Superman and Man of Steel by far. I'm just happy that Wonder Woman saved the DCEU for now.

1255,TooMuchSus,The DCEU is DOA,1,19 March 2018,"It started off as a cool concept.
Incarcerated supervillains being used as government pawns to reluctantly work together and stop greater threats? Yeah, that's cool.
Then they picked some of the least interesting DC Villains to work with. Now I know, you can't just comprise the whole cast of heavy hitters, you gotta bring in some obscure benchwarmers from the lineup so you don't blow it all too quickly. This film's cast is nothing but 2nd rate benchwarmers from the DC lineup. 
Then the first trailer came out. Then came the rewrites. And the reshoots. Every link on the chain of command rusted, came apart and turned to dust on the ground. The excessive reshoots and rewrites causing millions of dollars of budget to simply disappear, created a perfect storm of continuity errors from plot points that make no sense because their setup was established in scenes that were cut, to characters that are established in the beginning and proceed to become ghosts for the rest of the movie. Examples: Katana, the girl whose blade is so sharp it cut her scenes out of the movie, and Slipknot (the man who can climb anything) who became quite literally a ghost within 10 minutes of his introduction and had less than a minute of actual screentime. The main plot twist of the movie makes no sense within the film's context, and the main moral dilemma at the end is a trashfire because Deadshot and Rick Flag's inner conflicts make no sense, and the stakes are completely removed at the end meaning the moral dilemma was pointless from the getgo.
The soundtrack is the least memorable big-budget action movie schlock you'd expect from a film like this. That is, when it's even present rather than licensed music that is so painfully on-the-nose that it makes me wish I was wearing earplugs. In fact the original score for the film is unmemorable for two reasons; A) It's incredibly generic and B) it's barely even there.
The used needle icing on the medical waste cake that is this movie, is the horrible editing. A trailer house was brought in to put this Humpty-Dumpty film back together. Surprise surprise, they couldn't. The entire movie suffers from continuity errors, horrible pacing, bad framing and atrocious visual appeal. Since the film was pieced together by a trailer house, the entire film feels like every scene is another trailer back to back, it feels like a preview that never ends.

1264,McFly_2015,not what was expected but not a bad film,7,10 August 2016,"My review (minor spoilers)Overall the expectations I went in with were probably higher than they should have been. The narrative and overall plot were very difficult to follow. Like Batman v Superman, it wasn't a bad film in its own right but there were many plot points which could have been elaborated on. I figured there would be more humour but there isn't. Harley Quinn deserved more of a backstory. It was faithful to the comics but they rushed her transition from lonely psychiatrist to anarchist. It's a very compelling story of the psychiatrist attempting to turn the inmate sane but the inmate turning the tables and turning the psychiatrist insane. So much so I think there was enough material to make a Joker/Harley film on its own (though I guess a prequel could be still in the cards). Still for what we got, Harley Quinn was very well played and she definitely resembled her comic counterpart.Will Smith ends up stealing the show from Harley. He's more intimidating and frankly more dangerous given his combat skills. The only part of the character I didn't like was having the hardened criminal with the daughter he aims to please is getting rather cliché. Still Smith himself nails his role. Harley is separated from the Joker for most of the film and so Deadshot ends up her grounding rod for most of the film. The brief scene with Batman and Deadshot did have surprisingly good chemistry. Affleck got four scenes. Three as Batman, one as Bruce Wayne. He didn't have a lot to work with but did a good job with what he had. I feel it's premature and unfair to compare Leto to the other Jokers. The Joker doesn't have a lot of screen time and most of it is in flashbacks or dream sequences so there wasn't much room for character development. Viola Davis may have ended up as the unsung hero with honourable mention to Joel Kinnaman. I was heavily reminded of the Nick Fury/Phil Coulson relationship from the Avengers. Without spoiling any plot points, the two use similar plot points to motivate the team. Overall it was a very enjoyable film. The stakes are always high when you have super criminals on the loose. I am hoping for more films with these characters, particularly Deadshot and Harley. I think the reason people feel underwhelmed is that it may not have met their expectations. Expecting a humour packed film of bad guys doing bad things for an entire film was unrealistic. The first act was the strongest with the characters being introduced, the second act definitely stalls and suffers as if the film wanders aimlessly wondering what to do next but the third act redeems the film.It ends in a way in which there aren't necessarily unresolved cliffhangers but it does open up for a world of more films and excitement on what happens next.

1265,adiafora,This film should never have been released.,1,25 February 2017,"Suicide Squad is a brilliant example of a failed film. The story makes no sense at all, the characters make no sense and the whole experience just leaves you asking how a film can go this wrong and still get released. It seems like several different scripts were filmed, then edited together into three or four different films that were then chopped down and put into a single, confusing film. Some plot points are set up, but never resolved. While other scenes in the film seem to be the resolution of a plot point whose setup was left out of the film. And it's not, as one critic hypothesizes, that this is the results of comic book writers let loose in the movie business. Im a longtime DC comics reader and this film was every bit the confusing mess to me, as it was for casual moviegoers.",Suicide Squad

Look I got what I came for with this a cast with good chemistry and a cgi disposable army fight and some shady government mfs doing some shady government mfs things.

1269,navtaz,Incoherent and weak plot,6,24 August 2016,"To even make a movie with more than a half dozen super hero's/villains is hard enough but coupling that with a weak plot just makes this movie unbearable to watch. Will Smith gave an acceptable performance along with Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn surprising well even Cara Delevingne did a decent job with the enchantress but was held back by a very weak plot full of holes, the diabolical plan and the centuries old incubus falling relatively effortlessly.. Amanda Waller was more pomp than substance.. Jareds Joker was possibly the worst portrayal in the history of the Joker.. it seems all that ""staying in character"" was more pretentious publicity and unfortunately for the franchise did nothing to add any depth to his character. The prequel to the actual battle was lengthy with a lot of whining from an emo Diablo.. the plot lacked the depth and was least convincing in its execution. An utter disappointment.. After the tragedy called Superman vs. Batman, DC comics has scored another dud in its comic lineup..",Suicide Squad

The characters don't have enough depth and some of them do a horrible job as actors - the fire dude really hasn't impressed me.

1271,dstudie,Just awful (possible spoiler),1,9 October 2016,"Well, it is happening just as many predicted. In it's failure to keep up with Marvel, DC has begun an implosion of it's universe. It has destroyed the Superman and Batman franchises with utterly moronic movies, horrible directors, ludicrous plots, terrible actors and it has made a joke of Wonder Woman, and now they have released this abortion called Suicide Squad. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this mindless escapade into stupidity. Jared Leto's Joker is the goofiest thing I've ever seen and let's face it the TV joker was pretty goofy, but Leto tops it in horrible over the top robotic acting. The plot sucked eggs all the way through. A witch and her brother threaten the world, and a bunch of lame DC characters go to save it at the last minute by tricking a thousand or so year old witch who can basically read minds and project images into them and she couldn't see what one character is thinking. How utterly ignorant and stupid on the part of the writers and the director. The ending was so extremely lame I wanted to ask for my money back. All in all it's a forgettable piece of wasted work not worth the money to see it. My advice, go see Jurassic World again. At least Bryce Dallas Howard is nice to look at.",Suicide Squad
1272,omnyenge,It's a fun movie...stop putting it under a microscope,8,7 August 2016,"It's probably easier to join the negative review club than it is to admit that the movie has many enjoyable elements. I've read reviews out there that bash this flick about straying from the comics. Well, so does Marvel, but we seem to appreciate it in that instance.I watched this movie on opening night with a couple of friends and one of them hated it while the other loved it and couldn't wait for the Blue-ray release. When I asked the 'hater' why he hated it, he quickly used the comics as an excuse and also pointed out that it sucked just as hard as Batman v Superman. I call bullsh*t.*spoilers ahead*Suicide Squad follows the same map that most superhero flicks do. A bunch of super-powered people put aside their differences to fight a monster that none of them can defeat alone. In this case it's exactly like Age of Ultron; a monster that they created themselves. The story is essentially the same.DC has chosen to take a darker approach in their story telling. It's not all laughs like Marvel. I mean, who wants to watch two comic giants try to out-tickle their audience? I like that I can easily tell them apart.I can't argue with the pick of actors either. Most of the roles were done superbly. We have the mopey yet very powerful Diablo, the witty and dangerous Deadshot, the sexy but scary Harley, and the dangerous and even scarier Amanda Waller.I'll admit that the movie seems to linger in some areas it shouldn't (like exposition) and rush through other areas that it shouldn't (like how did everyone survive all those helicopter crashes with absolutely zero injuries?). Also, the final fight at the end could have used a little more work and a lot less seductive dancing - or whatever the witch was doing. But that doesn't take away the fact that it's a fun movie.Forget the negative reviews for a couple of hours and enjoy yourself.",Suicide Squad
1273,Troy33,Extended Cut Review: Pretty much what I expected,7,25 November 2016,"Please note that my review is only valid for the extended cut as I did not see this movie in it's theatrical version.To sum this up, this movie was exactly what I expected. The action scenes were entertaining, the story was not too complicated and it was simply a good time watching a bunch of bad superheroes working together to save the world. Lets be honest, this movie was not going to be a cult classic!The acting for Harley and Deadshot were outstanding. You could tell that these two were driving the movie forward and kept us on our seat. The chemistry between these two characters was fantastic. The rest of the cast did all right, but nothing too special.I loved how the movie was dark throughout. And as it should be coming from the DC Universe. The biggest letdown was that I expected so much more from the Joker. I like Jared Leto, and I think that he is an unbelievable actor. But to my taste, how he portrayed the joker wasn't that outstanding... But he did have huge shoes to fill from Jack and Heath before him.So to summarise, this was an all around entertaining film that delivered exactly what I expected. Good acting, great action, and Dark.",Suicide Squad
1274,zbill,a waste of time,3,16 August 2016,"This has got to be the worst film which I have seen in an awful long time. I can't understand how anyone could call this good as the story-line is rubbish, the action is the same as the action in every other good guys v bad guys film ever made with shooting and big explosions. There is nobody in the story who we could care for let alone get behind in a fight. I seriously wish I hadn't made the effort to see it as I thought the trailers looked rubbish but two young friends said it was good, two people whom I will never speak to again. The film makers knew this was a dud as they had to resort to putting in some awesome music tracks from Queen and the Rolling Stones to hide the fact there was no story here. There is not a single character who stood out except for Diablo who showed a bit of common decency, The Joker was a sad and overdone character, the Viola Davis character was terrible, what government official would get away with killing their employees, Deadshot was boring and the 'baddie' Enchantress was like a spitting witch from a Disney film. And I really enjoyed the touching moment Deadshot had with his daughter explaining how to shot someone, very moving!! And what I can't understand is how the squad became close as it appears in this film they only knew each other for 5 minutes which is a pretty speedy bonding process.

1277,joshuaprentice,Perfect Characters In A Untidy Plot,7,7 August 2016,"It's been a while since I have written a review, and with the split between fans and critics for this recently released film, I feel I should throw my two cents in. My experience with Suicide Squad comes from the animated film 'Assault on Arkham' and reading the first few volumes of the New 52 series. When this film was first announced, I was of course excited to see this movie. Unlike a few people I had few problems with the casting choices. Viola Davis I trusted would play a good Amanda Waller as I had previously seen her in the series 'How To Get Away With Murder' and she is effectively playing a character similar to Waller in that show. Margot Robbie's scene in 'Wolf Of Wall Street' where she teases Leo DiCaprio instantly sold me on the idea of her playing Harley Quinn and Jay Hernandez for me was ideal for Diablo having seen him performing as this unlike-able character that you grow to rout for when he's against worse people. This film ironically so was Hostel. My favourite character from the comic books is El Diablo, so I was determined to see his character done justice the most. My only gripe with casting was Will Smith as Deadshot. I knew from 'Pursuit of Happiness' he could do a good relationship with children, but Deadshot in the comics is, to put it nicely, a bit of a douche bag. I felt that Will Smith would make the character way to likable, and lack the ability to play this smooth, yet terrible person. Spoilers for a new 52 comic story Deadshot straight up kills another member of the squad for expressing their desire to kill Waller, because he wanted to be the one that kills her. But enough about my original views on cast and my connection to the franchise. Its time to talk about what I thought of the film. To put it honestly, as a fan of the comics, I enjoyed it. However, as a film, this one in particular left a lot to be desired. Getting my positives out the way first, the cast absolutely nailed their characters, and those that were barely in it, were interesting enough to want more of. Diablo,Waller, Quinn, and even Captain Boomerang were played fantastically, with each actor matching the personality's of their comic counterpart. Even Will Smith proved me wrong as Deadshot. Yes, there is a fair amount of Will Smith playing Will Smith, but he got Deadshot's bluntness, and passive aggressive nature down to a T. Some scenes in the trailers seemed to be Will Smith doing classic Will Smith lines, but in the context of these scenes these moments fit Deadshot's mannerisms perfectly. Kitana and Killer Croc were both side characters who were interesting enough, that I want to see more off them. That aside, the rest of the performances were everything from bland to shockingly bad. Cara Delevingne and Joel Kinnaman were absurdly bad in this, and alongside Smith, Robbie's and Davis performances, they stood out as the worst. The soundtrack, was fantastic. However, it didn't always work. I would buy the soundtrack in a heartbeat, but the opening changes songs repeatedly with no real sound transitions in between, and it just feels like they are trying to capitalise on the success of the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack. The following will be my only comparison to the Marvel Universe. There is a difference between a good soundtrack, and one that works with the film. Guardians soundtrack worked, because each song had a vital part to play for the tone when it was used. I will never forget how they opened that film with a depressing death seen and then follows with a moody dramatic scene of Star Lord landing on this planet, with dramatic, serious music, and for a second you think this will just be a generic marvel movie. Then Star Lord presses play and 'Come and Get Your Love' starts. Instantly the tone shifts and you know this will not be just another generic movie. With Suicide Squad, they just seem to throw these big songs in there for the sake of it. Sometimes the music choices work, but with the others it just feels like they are throwing as many widely known songs as possible. It doesn't help that the soundtrack is also marred with very choppy editing, clear scenes thrown in from re shoots to brighten the atmosphere, a plot that goes all over the place, and some jumps in character development that come out of nowhere. I could talk about the bland villain, who I will not be spoiling in this review, but its not like that other big universe has the best villains, so I give the bland villain story a pass. Also, I haven't talked about Jared Leto's performance as the Joker. All in all, I was pleased with what I saw. This isn't Ledger's Joker or Nicholson's; this Joker is more of a crime boss/wild card. He's not in this much, and while lot's of reviews complain about that, I never expected to see him much. You needed him to help introduce Harley Quinn and while the film could have done more to embrace their seriously messed up relationship, I enjoyed their dynamic together, and Leto even gave me a stand out thing to remember which I will not spoil, but it involve's a flashback. Oh yeah, there are a LOT of flashbacks! and the opening while doing well to introduce the characters, may as well have been a ring announcer for MMA or Boxing, coming out and introducing each member, as that's what the start felt like for me.The reason it gets such a OK score from me is despite its problems, this is a fun summer movie, that comic fans will enjoy, flaws and all. 3 1/2 stars",Suicide Squad
1278,pconley22,Total Disappointment,3,6 August 2016,"Suicide Squad has a horrible script. First, there was the story--such as it was--itself: A super villain with the power to end the world goes to work in a universe that has established Batman and Wonder Woman. So what do the authorities do? Call up Batman and Wonder Woman? Of course not! Hire a bunch of criminals to save the world.It would be like if the U.S. was invaded by China, and we went and got the Taliban to protect us.So, from the very bones of the story, the movie fails. Add in a tell-and-don't-show approach to characterization, and horrendous dialogue, and this film was doomed before it got off the printed page. I really wanted to like this film, but I just couldn't.So, let's go back to the tell-and-don't-show approach to the characters. Instead of seeing and experiencing anything, we're told what such-and-such is all about. It's an incredibly boring and lazy style of writing. Look at he scene where the principal characters all sit around and tell stories while they have a drink. But that's the thing: They shouldn't be telling us anything. Everything that is told to us as if we're a classroom of elementary school students instead of adults who can put two and two together, should be revealed through each character's dialogue and actions. But that would require some actual writing. This movie seems like it simply filmed the first draft of the screenplay. And then there's the dialogue itself. ""I've already killed one family; I won't kill another."" Who wrote this? A high school kid who thought he was being deep? Flagg refers to the love of his life as the girl he ""was sleeping with."" Serious? You're risking your life to save some broad you're banging? And then after two hours of watching Harley pine for Joker and reject the rest of the members of her ""squad"", she's finally given the chance to be with the Joker and live happily ever after. Well, despite everything we've seen for the past two hours alluding to the fact that that is exactly what she wants, she rejects that for ""her friends."" She's never shown any sort of friendship so far in this movie. But, dialogue. It's typical fill-in-the-blank writing. So, Harley didn't show any love for her ""friends"" but did for Joker. And then chose her ""friends"" over the Joker. So, I guess it's up to the audience to ""fill in the blank"" and decide what Harley's change of heart was all about? It shouldn't be the audience's responsibility to do the writer's job.The characters themselves were boring and uninteresting. Despite wasting the first 20 or so minutes on the film trying to make us love the psychotic Harley Quinn and mass murdering Deadshot, I didn't care. I just couldn't care for anyone or anything happening. It was like there was an invisible barrier between me and the screen. I just couldn't get into the movie. And since no one other than Harley, Deadshot, and Flagg got a pointless backstory introduction, the audience feels, subconsciously, that these are the characters that will carry the story. They don't. The only character that was even remotely interesting was Katana. And despite a few flashes here and there of decent martial arts and kenjutsu action, the character is wasted.And speaking of wasted characters, let's talk Joker. Jared Leto was upset how much of the Joker was cut from the film. If you can cut such a big name and charismatic character down to the point where the actor playing him complains, and still get away with a finished film, the problems with the script become apparent. Joker was wasted in this film. You cut him out entirely, the overall story doesn't change. So, why include him in the first place? Because shared universe...maybe? Or something? I don't know. And neither do the filmmakers.And while I know almost everyone on the planet--including those who despise the movie--praise Margot Robbie's Harley, I found her shtick getting old rather quickly. And then to top that off, she reneges on her established motive, thus making her a totally pointless character.And, before we move on from the topic of bad characterization, what was with Amanda Waller (a good guy...I guess?) executing FBI agents? I feel like I missed the most important scene in the movie--the one that shows something that makes the entire movie make sense. But then again, Amanda Waller doesn't make good choices. She has a folder, inside of which is a list of the upcoming DCEU characters: Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg, etc. She actually has dinner with Batman. But she puts the world's fate in the hands of Diablo, Boomerang, Harley Quinn and Deadshot. It's like calling the police because of a problem, and then scouring death row for the people who will actually solve this problem. Yeah, I'm confused too.But let's go to the ending. Because the ending shows us one thing: That the Suicide Squad's involvement in all of this was totally pointless. Simple bombs end up saving the day. Bombs. Man made, average, everyday bombs. Satchel charges. Any idiot in a uniform can detonate a bomb. So, why let out a bunch of mass murderers to save the world, if saving the world only involves setting off satchel charges? I mean, why not call the Air Force in, have them drop a couple of bombs, and send a guaranteed-to-be-disappointed-audience-anyway home early? One phone call to the Pentagon, and the ENTIRE MOVIE is UNNECESSARY. But, DC.In the end, this movie was a total disaster.",Suicide Squad

However I was very excited to see this movie. Trailer after trailer made it appear like this Guardians of the Galaxyesque misfits turned heroes all centering around the crazy antics of the insanely entertaining Joker. This was not that movie. Jarred Letto's Joker was well portrayed in the sense of you couldn't tell what he was really doing at first but in all reality they made him an over glorified mob boss who was missing his girl. He was in the movie sporadically, mostly in flash backs of Harley and it just didn't do much for me. The actual villain of this movie was not well developed in my opinion and could have been chosen better, she had minimal character development and they just kind of seemed to throw her in there along with her brother. Character development in this movie was another issue for me, you got to have insights into Deadshot and Harley which was fine but maybe a bit over done at times because you got nothing other than a few explanation lines on other characters and why they were ""bad"". Overall it wasn't a terrible movie just not one I'd watch again, very forgettable.",Suicide Squad

Disregarding this, it proves to be a fun entertaining film with great memorable characters and a magnificent score, only weighed down by an average villain and some cheesy dialogue.Most memorable is Will Smith as Deadshot, who does a terrific job in playing a character who is a 'bad guy', yet we can relate to him and his humour and timing is on point, so much so that I hope we see a spin off film with him.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is also great and portrays the character well as does Jay Hernandez as El Diablo and Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag. Almost all other characters are also well portrayed, with the exception of Katana, who whilst a great character, does not say much to actually give judgement.As for Jared Leto as Joker, whilst in my opinion he plays the role well, differently from others who have portrayed the same character but still interesting, he does not feature in the film enough to come to a definitive judgement, but with more appearances, I am sure he will prove to be even better.So overall I definitely recommend Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad

The jump cuts were awful, there was no back story on some characters, too much on others, Joker wasn't even necessary in this film, I felt they gave Will Smith way too much of the story, the villains made no sense, the personality shifts from ""You're my problem"" to ""*weeping* ""Save my possessed Girlfriend"" OR to Will Smith from *I'm an assassin for hire, I don't love"" to *weeping* ""Harley is my bff, I have to do it for my daughter!""...WHAT?! Speaking of which! Deadshot somehow SPEED READING a Top Secret Book he happened to find in a Closed Purse that it took Viola Davis half the first act to explain over steak?? Well Now I'm mad! Lets go drink Cocktails and shots slowly while said Davis gets her brain scrambled! It's not like the world is ending.....ALSO! You can't make a sacrifice of yourself for your ""family"" when the entire movie you sat in the background doing absolutely nothing, and refusing to interact with other characters establishing any sort of audience or character connection, then jump to ""This is my family! I won't loose another!"" Who are you, Vin Diesel!? It makes no sense! There were NO Establishing shots which makes a total disconnect from the viewing, Half the time I was thinking ""...wait what"" instead of ""oh that's cool"" and what was with the unnecessary slowdown at the end, which made the scene seem cheesy rather than heroic. As much as I love Maggie Roberts, what was with her accent coming in and out?! In the 3rd reel, she went from Harley Quinn to Jersey Shore! HOWEVER! the BIGGEST What the Balls moment was, THAT was NOT the mission she had planned for them. The Enchantress just went rogue in the first act. So what WAS the actual mission?! THAT'S what I want to know. It felt like this would have been the side mission, or the finale, but the entire movie is based on the fact that Enchantress busted out her brother and wants to build a machine to..kill everyone? Enslave everyone? Rule? WTF was her point?! But the biggest thing was that SHE was not the intended mission. They had one lined up.Joker wasn't even in this movie. He made no interaction with characters minus flashbacks and the one time he DOES interact it was with Harley for all of 3 minutes, but then he gets blown out of the sky, and she lands right back to the group, NONE of that need to happen!! You could have wrote the scene of him leaving her in prison via texts and still come to that moment in the rain on the cop car, and the movie still would have went on. IN FACT! IT would have made more sense, and been more of a surprise if at the end when he bursts into the prison that's the first time you see him! All in all, 5/10 Because to be fair, everything but the Villains graphically were awesome, the soundtrack was abrupt but well put together, and the acting from the big shots was excellent, and I actually did LIKE what they did to Joker and Harley.Not that anyone cares about my opinion, but tada.",Suicide Squad
1284,Sebastian_Conrad,I really wanted to like this movie...,3,8 August 2016,"I really wanted to like this movie but it was so disappointing. I'll take you through why I didn't like it. Like all movies, it comes down to the script. The script for this movie is terrible. Plain and simple. It is childishly cheesy at parts. Some of the events that take place... I literally sighed in the cinema. Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker is bad too. It's just wacky... not crazy, not mad, just terrible. This makes me really sad. Even after Heath Ledger's gritty and genius portrayal of the Joker, I thought that Leto could do a good job, after all, he is a great actor... but it is just weird and he is hardly in the movie. The characters have no characteristics - that is, consistent character traits that define them - one minute they are selfish but comical villains, the next, they are one big happy family trying to save the world! Moreover, there are so many character arcs in this film that every line of dialogue is exposition! It consists of one character telling another about their or someone else's backstory. The villain: Enchantress (if you could not tell by the trailers) is just another run of the mill villain, who wants to kill and destroy because... Not to mention shine a bright blue light in the sky while doing it... which is in every comic book movie now! Why DC?????? I am a DC. But Marvel films / TV shows are winning hands down at the moment. DC please get your act together! While you wait for them to, watch civil war.

1286,Olahn,Only for the die-hard DC comic book fans...barely,4,3 August 2016,"Where to begin... The film starts off with an introduction to two of the main characters and an intriguing scene that explains the background of each anti-hero.After the promising start, all hell breaks loose... in a bad way.Story and plot coherence are out the window, in comes loud explosions, gun fights and a remarkably limited character development and interaction.Technically, the film looked good, the props and special effects were decent and on par with other hero films, Margot Robbie was beautiful even though she was made to look trashy and crazy.I have a feeling WB instructed the director and writers to ensure Harley Quinn had a lot of scenes and focus, they most likely also mentioned Will Smith and Jared Leto, because no one out of the suicide squad members got any substantial development or attention, minus a couple of forced scenes that failed to create any impact.I enjoy films as a hobby but I also love comic books and its world and characters, so I'm biased and usually give good ratings for comic book films, because I usually judge them as a comic book fan first moreso than a film buff. But I couldn't help but cringe and shake my head several times during this film. The screen play was generally poor, the dialogue lacked substance nor importance or assisted in adding depth to the characters. The story, as mentioned earlier, lacked... and I'm not exaggerating if I say that the story is probably 8th or 9th on the list of ""what to focus on"" from the film maker. WB and DC might as well have called this film Deadshot or Harley Quinn and it would of been closer to what was presented to the audience.The good?, well seeing the characters from the comic books re-imagined in the DC film universe and I'm struggling to think of any others to be brutally honest.Overall, it is a rung or two below Batman vs Superman and even Man of Steel. This film felt like it was made for the sake of putting Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and Will Smith in DC character costumes... and thats it.It's NOT as bad as Green Lantern, but I cannot imagine myself re- watching this again. And thats a big statement since I've watched comic book films over and over with effort. Yes, even the early 2000 Fantastic 4 films.Avoid it if you are interested in watching a ""good"" action film that has acceptable storyline. But if you are a DC comic book hardcore fan, watch and judge it for yourself, it's your money.",Suicide Squad

""We are the bad guys that's what we do"" and the studio should have just let them do what they do best...baddest ass kicking bad ass.Remember Independence Day? The original one not the crap sequel that recently came out. Remember Hancock, I Robot, I am Legend? Remember that Will Smith? Yeah after a long time we get to see him back in action that we have missed so much. Margot Robbie charms you as Harley Quinn and she is the real 'enchantress' in this movie!Jared Leto was phenomenal playing the Joker. Even with such short screen time and minimal dialogues, he floors you completely with his performance. He was unpredictable, unstable and unbelievable.Otherwise the mediocre action, lame jokes, bland story and silly climax makes the whole movie nothing more than just a fun ride than what it could have been, should have been...in Harley Quinns own words ""What a ride!"".",Suicide Squad
1288,gpriceathome-798-8516,Suicide Squad: Best Love Story since Titantic...,10,5 August 2016,"I did not think I was going to like Suicide Squad very much, considering how very disappointed I was with Batman vs. Superman and Captain America Civil War recently, and I was right... and wrong. I did not like this movie...I LOVED IT!!!I actually liked it more than Guardians of The Galaxy. This is an excellent Family movie and date movie, its funny and romantic, and good action. A feel good movie. Not like Captain America Civil War. The story was good. Its a combination of Guardians of the Galaxy and The Last Witch Hunter with Vin Diesel. The character development was all over the place but I liked that. You thought you knew who the main characters were and then they introduced some new characters or told a new story about one of the main characters. Not worth seeing in 3D (I didn't notice much 3D) but I definitely enjoyed watching it on the IMAX and rich colors and great sound. If you liked the Guardians of The Galaxy you'll probably enjoy this one. So glad Will Smith choose this over Independence Day 2. This movie would be nothing without Will Smith. One of his best movies to me. He was perfect for this role. And I didn't think he would be. I thought this was going to be another After Earth, I Robot, Wild Wild West or Hancock (all movies Will Smith should NOT have done) But it was just the opposite. I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role. Will Smith made this movie better. He was right in his comedic element like in Men in Black and Bad Boys. The movie just worked because of his character and funny lines. He was a hero. And that's the problem I had with Batman vs. Superman and Captain America Civil War. These movies took my beloved heroes (Batman and Captain America) and made them bad guys. I'm old school. I like comics because the characters had high integrity, virtues and a courage that superseded regular folks. And the villains were villains because they modeled the worst behaviors and vices. This movie took Criminals and lead them on a path of redemption and made them heroes. Harley Quin was so well done. She was perfect. The actress should win an award for her performance. She knocked it out of the park, and her portrayal explained so many gaps we've always had about this character from decades of comic books, movies, and cartoons, that being she's a woman in love. She's crazy because she was so consumed with passion and in love. And she IS crazy...crazy good. Now the Joker was just awful. Not likable at all. As a matter of fact you just don't ever want to see him on screen. I don't think it was the actor's fault. I think it was the creative vision they went with. I didn't like him. Especially his makeup with braces or his costume, nor his mannerism, what he says and does, or the way he talks, its one of the weakest points of the movie--The portrayal of the Joker. Heath Ledger was a beloved villain and a brilliant depiction of the Joker. You could get next to Heath Ledger's Joker and be awed at his brilliance and creativity and frightened by his madness. He was an entertaining villain you just wanted more of. This joker is a pervert you'd see on an episode of Law and Order SVU that you hope will die soon so we don't have to see him again. BUUUTTTTTT.....the Heath Ledger Joker wouldn't have worked in this movie. No....this Joker was passionate and in love with Harley Quin, and you could feel it, and for just a few moments, for this story, he kinda worked. So the whole movie was a Frankenstein story. Dr. Frankenstein was played by Viola Davis and she was good--BAAADDD and very good at being bad. The monster was the team of misfits and they are lovable. Family Movie: Yes-13+I'd prefer my children to see the good values depicted in this movie than the values and examples in either the Captain America Civil War or the Batman vs. Superman movie. Thumbs up for Suicide Squad. Its appropriate for children 13+. There are some violent scenes of a man getting shot point blank in the head and sexual strip club dance scenes that I don't think is appropriate for under 13. Its a Love StoryThis was just the one of the best and most ROMANTIC films I've seen in a long time. Who would expect that from a comic book movie? I was was pleasantly surprised at the director's creativity to go so deep symbolically. Particularly with the falling scene and the gun Will Smith uses at the end. The whole movie is about ""demonstrative"" LOVE and REDEMPTION in different perspectives. **There is a scene in the movie with the Joker and Harley that is so passionate and romantic that it took my breath away. You just don't see that in a lot of movies today especially WITHOUT sex and nudity. But the writer/director was creative in letting you feel the depth of the emotion. I hope others get that. I suspect it might be overlooked because its a comic book movie, but I am grateful that I caught it. Overall I was pleasantly surprised. I don't know if I enjoyed it so much because I had such low expectations given what was presented to us with the earlier DC movies, but I really loved this movie. Very feel good. Definitely worth bringing the family to see.",Suicide Squad
1289,jakenathanasher,Talented Cast makes a poor script worth the watch.,5,5 August 2016,"Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto are all entertaining and make this worth the watch, but the movie fails on almost every other level. The script is the majority of the problem here. It's bogged down by loads of exposition and backstory, the majority of the characters are suspiciously lacking any kind of personality, and a lot of the one liners are cringe worthy. David Ayers movie was in tremendous need of a rewrite here, but Warner Bros hurried him a little too much here. Maybe the movie's problem was the reshoot to add more humor. I don't know, but there is no excuse for a director as talented as Ayer to be working with a script like this.",Suicide Squad

But unfortunately,this just them trying too hard after the bad reviews of B V S.I absolutely disliked all the characters.Even The Joker and Harley Quinn. Jared Leto Wasn't bad , he just wasn't as good as Heath Ledger. And Margot Robbie wasn't bad either,I just found her character to be a bit over sexualized and not the batshit crazy villain I had hoped she would be.I really tried to like Will Smith's Deadshot,Because I like him in anything he does,But he too was lackluster . And none of the other supporting cast never really made an impact on me.But ultimately , Why it was an below average movie was because it didn't give me anything new and I know a lot of people who think the same.They could have gone a lot of ways,but it looks to me that they picked the worst route.This could have been a really edgy thriller with psychological elements, but they decided to go the marvel way and screwed it up.I give it a five because Jared leto really tried . that's it.",Suicide Squad
1293,dorobatcosmina14,The movie had nothing to do with what the trailer promised,1,15 August 2016,"This movie was so disappointing that I think I will just skip the cinema for the upcoming DC movies. The plot was bad with so many clichés, I constantly rolled my eyes with every ""we are bad guys"" line. Also, I couldn't stand to hear another ""puddin"". The dialogue was poorly written or interpreted and the few moments that were supposed to be ""funny"" were just hard to watch and hear because of the lack of originality (I am talking about the ""delete my browser history"" joke) or the infelicitous chosen moment. This supposed to be an antihero movie, chaotic, unpredictable but it fell into disgrace; by the middle of the movie it transformed into a very superhero movie without making any sense. I still have no idea why Deadshot or Harley Quinn decided to save the world out of good heart denying everything that they are and represent. I gave it a 5 out of 10 because I really liked Margot Robbie performance, she looked amazing and she played her role flawlessly. She was the single factor that kept me from exiting the movie theater.Update. Every time i remember this movie or someone mentions it to me it seems even worse. With every memory I dislike it more and more. 1 star, very dissapointed.",Suicide Squad
1294,ronaldlfields,Very little of value in this film,4,13 August 2016,"I'm a fan of superhero and super-villain movies in general, so I was naturally looking forward to this film. Now, I wish I had my 12.00 back. Will Smith was humanizing and wonderful, as he almost always is. Viola Davis was a bright spot in the film as well. What was most disappointing was every other thing about the movie. The script was filled with un-necessary events and even more un-necessary people. Had this been a Batman versus Deadshot film, I think this would have been excellent. But the director, screen writer, producer, and every other actor/actress on the screen got in the way of what could have been a really interesting story. Jared Leto's Joker got a lot of screen time for some reason, though he was not central to the plot and Leto's acting was not even of peripheral importance. Harley Quinn was nothing more than eye candy and practically all of her scenes were gratuitous to the point -- if there was one -- of this absolutely worthless film. This movie COULD have complicated the status of super-villain a little more, showing the complexity that exists within even the darkest of human hearts. It almost did so with Smith's Deadshot, but that was due only to Will Smith's incredible performance. As a master,he turned very few ingredients into something palatable; alas, the rest of the film disappointed sorely. I believe that Marvel Studios knows what to do with an all-star ensemble cast. The DC studios-- I think they're better off rebooting Batman every four or five years. That's what they're good at.",Suicide Squad
1295,dvdurst08,Individual Performances VS. Overall Plot/Story,8,5 August 2016,"I want to start off this review by stating that my opinion is as a fan, and not so much a true critic by any means. With that out of the way we can begin.First thing I liked was the intro of the characters. Some say it was rushed and seemed like a presentation or school project in format. However, with this many people that is really the only way it could have been done without it taking the whole movie. Critics can hate it for being choppy and rushed, but I praise the creativity and doing what is necessary in the time allotted. Second things I LOVED were the performances. Now this is where the movie shines and Ayers writing shows. The way he built the character dialogue, and their backgrounds (however brief they were) allow good actors (Smith, Robbie, Leto, Davis, and yes even Courtney) to shine in their roles. These ""villians"" were made to show signs of humanity like fatherly love, romance, or caring about more than money/themselves. This is the area where the movie shines and the writing shows. Last thing I liked were the subtle additions to the movie. YES, batman is in it (that shouldn't be a spoiler), and the way they use him is perfect. The Jokers inclusions (however brief) are well done, and the great actors they got to play minor characters is impressive. Jay Hernandez as ""El Diablo"" is by far the most criminally underrated character (both in abilities and in his depth), and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as ""Killer Croc"" is amazing. Both actors have great careers, and here they step in as fillers. Scott Eastwood, Ezra Miller, and even Ben Affleck join in for cameo's and nail the parts (Affleck is the after credits scene).The One thing I hated is the story, and I say that because there almost wasn't one. David Ayer wrote such beautiful cast background and depth for the characters, but the story falls apart about 40 minutes to an hour in. The main villain is spotty, not to mention obvious, and the ""why is this happening"" is a mystery. I do not know if Ayer is to blame or if it's Warner Bro's for rushing production and forcing re-shoots and over editing, but it did not work at all. I hope Warner doesn't kill this franchise by being overly involved. I would give Ayer another shot easily. Overall: The cast saved this movie with their performances, and if they hadn't got all this depth in the characters it would have tanked. I value the performances above overall story, because even when the story started to tank and editing issues were hugely present the characters still entertained and provided laughs or enjoyment.",Suicide Squad
1296,marcaltoncooper,Awesome!,10,16 August 2016,"I was somewhat dubious about seeing this as I had read a mixed bag of reviews, however having just come back from the cinema I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed the film, it was excellent.Harley Quinn was the best and her love of the Joker clear for all to see. Deadshot was also great, a bit of depth along with Quinn. Flag and June was a nice touch, a love story, along with Quinn and The Joker, Deadshot and his daughter.I guess my only question would be 'what was Boomerang there for' he didn't do anything!All in all it was an excellent flick...",Suicide Squad
1297,fishrobertson,"Messy, blurred, not enough individual screen time and poor acting but some fairly enjoyable and funny moments",6,1 April 2017,"Suicide Squad is the direct follow up to BATMAN V SUPERMAN, a film that was discredited by regular watchers and critics, so really it would've been nice/good if suicide squad was almost like a backup to get fans back into DC movies. Unfortunately Suicide Squad failed in lots of ways to some extent. It had blurred action scenes toward the end, poor cast choice, not enough individual screen time and a fairly messy script, the characters weren't emphasised enough and it was unclear what Jared Leto's Joker was actually to doing for half the film, as Cara Delevingne poorly performed Enchantress to up most of the screen time he INDIVIDUALLY deserved as if you going to add one of the most popular villains in comic books into a movie you have to give him enough screen time. However overall it was enjoyable as some of the casting was decent, including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davies and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje were well picked for the character (even if some of them didn't get enough screen time). It would've been nice to see more emphasis on Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's Killer Croc, his strengths and weaknesses and his relationship with Batman. I though he was well picked for the character though as he has got the wright body type and muscle. To further matter it would have been nice to see a little more emphasis on Karen Fukuhara's Katanna as I thought she did an exceptionally good Katanna but I can see why that character shouldn't or won't being expanded upon. Jay Hernandez's El'Diablo had a little bit to much screen time like Margot Robbie and Will Smith. Margot Robbie's and Jared Leto's relationship wasn't creepy as David Ayer thought it was and I think their relationship should have been expanded on at a later date (Joker movie or Harley Quinn movie or Batman movie). Furthermore there wasn't enough screen time for other characters due to the over emphasised Harley, Joker relationship. Consequently due to the messy script Joker just appeared dealing with mob bosses and nothing else that he did had any affect or meaning. Overall this movie is worth watching so that you are up to date on all the crazy stuff going on/down in the DCEU. Otherwise this movie is nothing to get exited about, other than the half decent cast and humour. I hope this review helps you decide your own opinion or helps you decide whether or not to watch the movie.",Suicide Squad
1298,abrarabeer82,A fun movie with more problems then usual movies.,9,21 August 2016,"First of all suicide squad is a group of bad people that exist in the Batman universe of DC comics. All members of the suicide squad were caught by Batman or they dealt with Batman in Gotham city. They were chosen to be 'Task Force X' by a U.S. intelligence officer, because these are all expendable people that don't matter to society.Now let's get into the movie. Right from the get go the movie had problems. There were so any characters that their intro took half of the movie away and they still could not explain all the characters. The movie felt like watching the trailers all together, cause it was cut poorly. Very poorly to be exact. David Ayer did say that this is his cut of the movie but we have seen some really good movies from this guy and it is a little hard to believe that he did this cut. The studio was confused on how they wanted to portray these characters. Cause we know from the comics and they animations that the Suicide Squad is a very lively group of people. But they have done very bad and dark things. Studio made the movie showing some of those dark features but they then wanted to turn it into a humorous movie. Obviously because of all the criticism from 'Man of Steel' and 'BVS: Dawn of Justice'. But this just made the scenes detached from each other and made the audience frustrated.Now let's talk about Joker. First of all you don't have Joker in a movie and don't give him an arc. He is one of the greatest villains in comic book history. He can't be there to only save Harley Quinn. Also they showed him too soon in the movie. He should have been given a grand entrance. Instead we was given 15 seconds inside Harley Quinn's intro. Everyone was so excited to see a new Joker after the memorizing performance Heath Ledger gave and Jared Leto actually did a good job. But we didn't get to see it cause he was in there for like 10 minutes. That was a very big upsetting factor for the fans. Cause we all went to the theaters to see Joker terrorize Gotham city. Instead we got a dancing witch.I simply stated out all the bad things about this movie. But none the less it was a good movie. It was a fun movie. The reviews are extremely harsh. The music was some of the best music I have ever heard in any movie. The acting was superb. Will Smith as Deadshot simply killed it. One, when he was showing off his skills and just ripping through rounds of bullets to hit the same target on the same bulls eye and two, jumping on top of that car and killing those hundreds of faceless creatures all by himself. We saw what Deadshot really is. We saw the true fear in all the other solders eyes. We saw them realizing that this man can wipe them clean in seconds if he wanted to and that moment truly captured the character. We saw the sweet, loving and also fierce side of Harley Quinn. At the end El Diablo took his true form and that whole sequence was awesome.St the end watch the movie. It is worth every penny and just a fun time with friends.",Suicide Squad
1299,ayresryder,Harley Quinn,10,3 September 2016,"Harley Quinn is a sexy cash cow that was bound to be monetized into a major motion picture and this movie is the quintessential form of what I know from the Harley Quinn Universe. I am a fan but I am not a fanatic. I did, however, grow up watching the Batman cartoon with Harley Quinn and that version of the joker and this movie is a perfect stamp from that mould. I read some bad reviews but I saw that the general consensus on the IMDb was about a 7 and that is always a good movie in my experience. Based on the previews I was impressed by the storyline and thought that over-all the movie was very well written, directed, and acted. And it did a good job of livening my interest in the Joker/Harley Quinn cartoon movies and continuations of that version of the Batman universe. You know, I think an aging generation doesn't get it but before watching this movie I saw previews for yet ANOTHER King Kong movie and it too looked like an exciting movie. I had to say, ""it appears that Hollywood has run out of ideas"" but apparently they've been saying that for 50 years. And with Bollywood coming out with amazing movies and the Russian Avengers getting interest in the United States it may be that the dust has settled in Tinseltown and another region of the world gets a turn at being the glory hole. We shall see about that, but I rate this movie as a ten because there's no amount of money or talent that could have made this a better movie. It's too bad our standards are so high that the populous just doesn't get that the passion has been dimming for a while. A person who is fat and happy can still do a good job but they can't make magic. That is a privilege relegated to the poor, the hungry, and the undiscovered.",Suicide Squad
1300,thetamahawk,"Really cool film, poor movie",6,29 September 2016,"A lot of people didn't like this movie, and majority of critics despised it. I thought that this film was poorly done, in order of events and confusing tactics that you wouldn't find in normal films. There were questionable things like at the start they ordered things very strange and didn't give all the characters enough or any justice at all. They showed a decently in depth back story of the two main characters (Harley and Deadshot) and left the rest with sentence long back stories which is completely unfair. They should have had equally as long origin stories at the start and then fleshed out Harley and Deadshot along the way. Visually it was quite stunning. CGI was pretty impeccable especially in the final battles. The action was very poor. There was only one good fight scene and that was one with Harley by herself. One thing that I like about the DCEU is that they are bringing in new story lines and costumes and all that jazz for their characters, rather than having the exact looks in their films as the comics have, which is what marvel is doing. The threat is pretty meagre but one scene where the villain starts attacking civilians shows how deadly they are. How they defeat the threat are pretty quick and unoriginal tactics. This film has some slow motion scenes in it which look stunning because this film was shot on film. It was quite a spectacle and well directed. I believe outer influences affected this film too much. Tones were balanced well despite what others say as it fits because of the variation in character which depending on which character is on screen changes musical influences and emotion. Overall this film was terrible with really good things in it. I'm sure a alternate home release cut will fix this film and make it absolutely amazing and spectacular.",Suicide Squad
1301,hvishwanath23996,"Not a bad movie, but it ain't a good one either.",5,22 August 2016,"First Off everybody waited for this movie because it had live adaptation of Joker after a long time in it, but believe me it wasn't worth it. He appeared as a forced entry rather than good part in the film. I personally had huge expectation because it was coming from a director whose last flick was a world war 2 tank movie and with amazing character devlopment. Now this movie had no character devlopment of any sort except harley and deadshot. DCEU is failing miserably in that part be it MOS or BVS. The Jokes feel forced, choppy story and miserable script. This movie like BVS has god awful script. I heard the news that they had a lots of cuts to match MCU movies. Now coming to the good part, Will Smith, was stand off. He was the most entertaining part of Suicide Squad. He delivered almost all the goods in the movie. Next up Harley quinn up to a point was good, but when it came to awful dialogues nobody could save her. Voila Davis had her moments and at the climax she too sucked. Rick Flag had a half baked forced moments. boomerang, El Diablo, Katana, Croc were just there to make film look good in trailers. The start of the movie was good and from then on the torture started. And Batman's role was terbly wasted. I would suggest you this movie if youn are a die hard DC fan, not for others though.",Suicide Squad
1302,resolve-239-859515,Hey! You guys... it's actually a pretty good movie.,9,12 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is still a good movie... it just squandered the opportunity to be a great movie. I would say don't be put off by the negative comments and ratings. Watch it and make up your own mind... Which is what you should do with any movie really.For the most part the movie crackles. It plays out really well and is fun and exciting. Some of the scenes in this final cut seem a bit confusing and we are learning now that this is because some scenes were changed (perhaps for the worse) from the original direction they were heading or deleted altogether. I would like to see those scenes restored and I am sure the film would benefit greatly and would become even better.Probably my biggest gripes with this film are: The main villain should have been the Joker. Enchantress was a rubbish villain and very lackluster. To be honest it was a very poorly written villain. lots of arm waving and ""look at me, look at me- I am casting a spell"" for the whole movie and not much else.The Joker should have had more screen time and all those scenes that were filmed that were ultimately cut would have really fleshed out his character and his relationship with Harley. Some of the Joker scenes we see in the trailer do not make it to the finished film and I think this was a mistake and the film suffers for it.The army of foot soldiers that the Suicide Squad has to fight through are faceless, formless piles of goop or something. It made for very poor action scenes whenever they were involved. Could have been done much better and made to seem more threatening and exciting.All in all, the film is a good one. It even is a bit self-deprecating in some parts and that is refreshing. Will Smith and Margo Robbie Shine in their roles. Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker was awesome, I thought. It is just a pity that all his hard work ended up on the cutting room floor and the character was reduced to only a few measly scenes. It would have been good to see the Joker in all his glory.So I would say go see the film. Hate it if you are going to hate it, love it if you are going to love it. Or, like me, choose to take the good with the bad and enjoy the experience.",Suicide Squad
1303,follin-greg,The 2000 Washington Redskins of the Summer (Paper Champions),5,7 August 2016,"It appears that Hollywood and the NBA have been embarking on the same ""super team or bust"" approach the past 10 years. Their formula for success consists of throwing as many stars as possible on the same team, factoring in the other variables after the fact. Disney's Marvel universe resembles the 2010 – 2014 Miami Heat, a consistently successful machine with a very high floor. Universal's Fast and Furious franchise mirrors the Oklahoma City Thunder right down to the balls to the wall mentality of Rusty Westbrook. While Fox's X-Men looks like the LA Clippers to me, a star studded squad that comes up just short every year for some reason, but still entertaining in it's own right.WB, looking to enter the fray, assembled their own super team for the Batman/Superman centric DC Comics universe. However, what looked great on paper turned out to be the 2012-2013 Los Angeles Lakers. Remember how hyped everyone was upon hearing that Dwight Howard, Steve Nash, and Kobe would be on the same team? But then they actually played a game and people realized that they sucked together (my other analogy for this before I came up with the NBA angle was the quintessential paper champion 2000 Washington Redskins). And for the record when it comes to non-blockbuster, adult movies, I think WB offers the best material out of the major studios (i.e. Creed, Nice Guys, Black Mass, etc), but man, their blockbusters are on a bad streak. I'm not sure who's having a worse 2016, WB's DC character universe or my Facebook newsfeed.Which brings us to DC's latest installment, the critically pummeled Suicide Squad. This isn't really as bad as its 26% Rotten Tomato score would attest. I actually think the cast does a good job, most notably America's current #wcw Margot Robbie and surprisingly Will Smith, who exudes his most charisma since Bad Boys 2. Meanwhile Jared Leto does OK with The Joker. That's a no win situation for him in following up Heath Ledger's iconic Oscar winning performance, so as long as he doesn't butcher it and stays in his lane, it works. For me, there are enough good scenes and performances to justify seeing Suicide Squad. If an album had a couple good jams surrounded by trash filler songs, you wouldn't renounce the album entirely.So it's not the actors, and I don't even necessarily think it's the direction. The real problem with Suicide Squad is simply an overall corny story. It seems like such an unforced error to have this group of likable misfits played by bankable stars team up to defeat what amounts to a bootleg version of Gozer The Destructor from the original Ghostbusters and hundreds of faceless minions. I realize this is a superhero movie so you have to suspend belief, but they couldn't come up with something just a little more grounded? WB clearly wants these movies to be taken seriously given the resources they are applying to the franchise, however by mixing in with these cartoony elements it just comes off as a very uneven tone.",Suicide Squad

And Harley is not so special to kill some type of spirit or old god, whatever is it.All villains have the worst mentality and killed and stole a lot, but in just one situation, all of them decided to be the good guys and face the worst villain.The other strong villain who can destroy Helicopters from a distance of more than 500 meters, just decides to just girly kick the villains who became good guys and decided to face him.The black lady was under the water, and just appeared so alive to others with a phone in her hand threatening to kill them.

Will Smith plays Deadshot well (despite the fact that the writers clearly don't know who Deadshot is). Jared Leto plays a great (if unfortunately useless) Joker. So the film was cast perfectly. Unfortunately not every character gets an appropriate amount of screen time. The majority of this film is dull, sappy scenes with Deadshot and Harley Quinn which pry deeper into the emotions of their characters than it should. I'm all for breaking into new areas of classic characters. But not in a way that detracts from the enjoyment of these characters. Deadshot is never fun in this film. He's supposed to be a heartless, psychopath who will kill anyone for money. Yet in this film he's a sweet, caring, goody. That's the main problem I have with this film. What they've done to the characters. They've taken some of the greatest, evilest DC characters and turned them into heroes. Now I understand that's the premise of the film, 'the badguys save the day'. And I like that idea. But they need to be badguys. And for the most part they're not. Talk about underwhelming characters. Say hello to the Joker. My favourite villain of all time. Who does LITERALLY nothing in this film. He's absolutely useless. If he wasn't in this film it would play out exactly the same way. He's only here to con people into buying a ticket. I think the director (David Ayer) was trying to channel Guardians of the Galaxy, but for DC, and unfortunately failed. Its nowhere near as funny, has boring action scenes. And where GOTG actually had heart, this film tries to hard to do the same. Which doesn't work with these characters! I've written quite a bit and its time I went to sleep, I was going to talk about the plot but since its so stupid, and uninspired I'd better not. I'm still trying to figure out these characters intentions. Please try and look past beyond the acting, and the explosions when you see this movie. Think about it.",Suicide Squad
1307,NinthGlaive,"Had promise, but quickly fell flat",1,13 September 2016,"I was so disappointed with this film. Honestly the premise intrigued me, and I was hooked as soon as the trailers started dropping, but I couldn't have been more disappointed with the outcome. EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO FAST. Honestly. It felt like the entire plot of the movie was explained in 5 minutes, and the audience was just supposed to follow on after that. I got lost at different parts throughout the movie, until I finally said ""forget it"" and just tried to enjoy the movie for the action sequences. Which did a little to help the overall impression of the movie. Acting was sub par, but the standouts for me were Deadshot and Harley Quinn. But in the end I'd probably give Will Smith the trophy for his portrayal of morally-torn Deadshot. If all you want out this movie is a average action film, with a great soundtrack, then this is the film for you. But I would advise against anyone who is looking for a movie with a visible plot, or a intriguing villain (the Enchantress just made me weirdly uncomfortable). Also, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is expecting a good portrayal of the Joker. Leto does a horrific job at portraying a multi-faceted and demented character (plus his laugh made me want to rip my hair out). I would definitely wait until this movie comes out on DVD instead of wasting upwards of 13.50 on a movie that fails to deliver.",Suicide Squad
1308,martintree,Mediocre,5,5 January 2017,"Its better than Batman vs Superman but still isn't a good movie. The premise is simple however the film constantly feels as if it has to remind us that these are the bad guys and that's not good. The overall plot is a bit of a mess and the third act is awful however there is good to be taken from it. Will Smith and Margot Robbie do great in their roles, Robbie especially however surprisingly its Jai Courtney who steals the show as Captain Boomerang. Jared Leto makes an interesting Joker but is no patch on Heath Ledger and doesn't get nearly enough screen time. The action is good if a bit unmemorable and the soundtrack is alright. For a movie about bad guys though the main villain ""Enchantress"" is truly terrible. Its a shame as I feel the rumored re-shoots really hurt this film. A more darker film with more character development would of been much nicer as there was potential here for a cult classic.",Suicide Squad

1310,nickpolsinelli,Hilariously Bad,2,20 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was a horrible film. I don't even know where to begin. I went in hoping that the critics were wrong, and it would be an entertaining summer blockbuster. I was painfully mistaken.First of all, the dialogue was atrocious. Especially from Harley Quinn. Everything that comes out of her mouth makes me want to cringe. ""We're bad guys, it's what we do."" ""Puddin', I don't know how to swim."" Terribly delivered lines. I can't blame Margot Robbie for this performance. No one could say those lines without sounding like nails on a chalkboard. Every line that comes from Viola Davis' mouth sounds like they're trying to be sophisticated, but they don't make any sense. ""We put they (or her/ him, can't remember) in a hole and threw away the hole."" What a great line. Also, the last line from the terribly forgettable villain (a seven-thousand year old witch that wants to kill every human on Earth) was ""you don't have the balls."" Bravo. I also remember Deadshot's daughter to have very bad lines, but maybe it was just her robotic acting. And I know it's nitpicking, but the Joker's laugh as he lays down beside his knives in one scene (was also in the trailer, I think) tried to be creepy and menacing, but came off has laughable. But more on the Joker later.Next, the structure. The first fifteen to twenty minutes is just introducing characters. Viola Davis sits down, and talks with food in her mouth, telling several men about the villains (which would later become the Suicide Squad). I even have a problem with *this* because they introduce only Harley Quinn and Deadshot, and suddenly the title pops up, and then they get back to introducing the rest. Either have the title at the beginning of the film, or introduce everyone, and then play the title. Anyway, almost the entire movie takes place in a city, going through buildings. The same place in the trailers. We see flashbacks to each member of ""the Suicide Squad's"" past life (except for Killer Croc, and there's only one for Captain Boomerang, that only lasts a few seconds during the introduction). This film really confused me at first. I have no prior knowledge of the Suicide Squad in the comics, so I thought Cara Delevingne's character (who is the villain) was a part of the Suicide Squad at first. The way she got possessed by the witch (don't remember her actual name) was walking through a cave, and she broke off the head of some doll, and apparently got possessed. They give no backstory on who this witch is, where she came from, why she had a doll in a cave. You really just have to accept it. Most of the other backstories are cliché. The ""Fire"" guy (don't remember his name) was a family man who loved his children, but one day he killed them all in a freak accident. Deadshot, another family man, loves his daughter, but was arrested by Batman because she ""told him not to shoot"". Harley Quinn's backstory is a tad fuzzy. She falls in love with the Joker at the Arkham Asylum (she's apparently his counselor or something), gets a machine gun for him, becomes a stripper, and falls into a barrel of paint. Best not to ask questions. Then the Joker drives her off a bridge, and Batman saves her. There's no real plot to this movie. Viola Davis wants them to kill the witch, who is terrorizing the city, they have awkward conversations and argue along the way, Harley Quinn breaks a window, then they go to the witch (she also has this boyfriend, but don't even remember what he looks like) kill her boyfriend, the Harley Quinn stabs her, and her *other* boyfriend (who fell in love with Cara Delevingne) crushes her heart. And they leave it on a cliffhanger, when the Joker breaks into Harley's prison cell, and lets her escape.This film is also unnecessarily dark. No, really, it was hard to even see what was happening at times, because the film had some sort of ""shadow palette"" added to it. Why is DC trying to make their films as dark as possible? The Man of Steel was dark, Batman V Superman was dark. Make a film colorful if you want to include ""humor"". It's like Breaking Bad taking place on Sesame Street.Lastly, the Joker. Why is Leto's Joker being applauded? I personally think Leto is a great actor, but his performance reminded me of Lex Luthor in Batman V Superman. Way too over-the-top. He's hardly even in the film. I feel like he tries to be menacing, but everything he does just falls flat. They shouldn't have included him in this film, I felt if he had more backstory and purpose (and less over-the-top acting) I would have enjoyed his performance just a little more.I give this film a 2/10, and wouldn't recommend this anyone. Wasn't even very entertaining. The only reason I give this a 2 instead of a 1 is because they actually put effort into this film. I can tell Jared Leto, Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and everyone else in this film is actually trying to put in effort to their performance, but they fail in doing so.",Suicide Squad
1311,vrpg1998,This is not that bad... But is not good either.,5,5 August 2016,"When I hear ""Suicide Squad"" the first thing that comes to my mind is ""sick and dark humor with a lot of violence"" but the movie is not really like that. I'm saying that just because I did no like the jokes or that there is not enough violence in the movie that makes this movie in something bad, no. Actually, the humor is on point (yes, there are bad jokes and out of context too) the history behind some characters is good (others... well, I hope there is a sequel for them), but this movie needed something to turn in the awesome movie about villains that they told us this was going to be. I'm really disappointed about that, but I can't tell this was an awful movie.",Suicide Squad
1312,johnoconnor-26740,Solid 8/10. Don't let bad reviews spoil it for you.,8,8 August 2016,"There is a fine line between being critical and being a dick. When it came to reviewing Suicide Squad, the critics and Rottentomato users completely crossed that line. I have to admit, I like read some reviews about a film before watching it, or at least check the IMDb rating, but sometimes it just spoils the mood completely. Trust me when I say, that Suicide Squad is NOT as bad as everyone is making it seem like. That was the one question I googled before going to the cinemas to watch it. Is Suicide Squad as bad as everyone was saying and is it worth watching? Yes. It is worth watching and no, the film is not as bad as the reviews depicted it to be. I'm not giving this film a 10/10, because yes, there were some major flaws and some cringey moments : Unnecessary script, the forced laugh of the Joker and rushing of the plot, but it was still watchable, heck I enjoyed it. I was shocked by how well the movie started, with the introduction of the characters and the motif. It's only about half way through the film, that awkward scenes and bad script makes its appearance, but is definitely not as bad as most reviewers are saying. I loved the music by the way.I'd like to keep this review short and without any spoilers, so I won't elaborate on the flaws. Please, don't let bad reviews spoil it for you. Go watch it yourself and form your own opinion, personally I enjoyed it and would probably watch it again.",Suicide Squad

1314,eleanorafarrell,"Wow, that was awful",2,8 August 2016,"I had a lot of hope for this movie. The commercials made it look so good that I really wanted to like it, but I can't achieve the impossible. It starts off getting a feel for the character and an introduction to them. This is all good and helps set a basic idea of what's going on and what will happen. You see Viola Davis pitch the whole Suicide Squad idea and it's all set up. When the squad is sent out you think they are going to accomplish one thing (that I won't say for the spoilers), but then towards the end it get's weird and unclear. Also they started to throw in random character that we didn't know about like the lady from Japan and the one guy with the cornrows. The Joker was such a random character. I understand to know Harley Quinn's background we need to know about him, but like he was so irrelevant. I feel like the writing was just really bad in general because the second half of the movie was a hot mess and the cheesy one liners. Then the acting was awful. I love Margot Robbie, but she and Jared Leto were terrible. Like really, really bad. I think the director/writer was just so excited about being able to go so many different ways with this movie, that he wanted to do them all (that wasn't a good idea). If they had a different writer/director this could be a great movie. Too bad they didn't.",Suicide Squad
1315,eranlevy,"Big potential left unfulfilled, but still well worth watching",7,6 August 2016,"This movie had a potential to be a milestone and one of the biggest successes of the genre in recent years. It has superb cast, very cool characters, a refreshing idea that psychopathic villains are the stars - everything looks so cool and promising in the beginning of the movie (and the trailers). The ground is well setup.However, a lot of it is left unfulfilled later and it feels like it could've been much better. First, characters eventually don't show enough of that ""craziness"". The studio should've just unleashed them, let them go wild and do the crazy things they're supposed to do, even if that means it would be R rated.Then, the script is so so, and the directing and editing jobs leave a lot to be desired. Something doesn't work as smoothly as it should've.Still, it's by far not as bad as critics portray. All of the major cast is doing an excellent job, especially Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. Dressings and make up is superb, it's like watching a comic come to life. Soundtrack is cool. All of these are enough to make it interesting and enjoyable. Don't miss it, well worth watching despite the issues!",Suicide Squad
1316,beyersverre,Failure,4,23 July 2017,"I know that i am a year late, but i just wanted to re-enter the comment nightmare to Suicide squad. This movie didn't do everything it promised. It was supposed to be the nr.1 movie in America and they said it was going to be awesome and extreme, but the reality is that after batman vs. superman the directer to the suicide squad movie got a little self-conscious and did a hole number of rewrites . That is not saying that it was a good movie to begin with, its just that in the trailer we saw a bunch of scenes, and characters that didn't make it to the final product. I think that DC should have hired another writer for this movie. It would have been amazing if DC gave Christopher Nolan the opportunity to make this movie into a bloody masterpiece.",Suicide Squad
1317,xXenomorphx,Over-hyped and disappointing mess,3,17 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was my most anticipated movie ever. I watched every trailer and TV spot the day they came out, and read the 1987 and 2014 comic series. Batman: The Animated Series is my TV show. After seeing the reviews, I lowered my expectations, going into the movie wanting to love it. This movie had the potential to become one of the best comic book movies, but it fails miserably in many ways.1)The plot was one giant generic mess. It was a simple and filled with clichés, which is really disappointing considering the idea of a group of criminals forced to go on missions and do good is an incredible base for a great story.2)For a movie full of villains, and where anyone could die at any moment, there was a huge lack of tension. You barely cared for any of the characters, and most of the action consists of the squad fighting against CGI monsters, which loses all of the tension this movie should of had.3)The characters were badly written. None of the characters actually feel like villains, and are more like heroes. Harley Quinn is barely insane, Deadshot is Will Smith, and the rest of the characters are wasted. Katana and Captain Boomerang had nearly no role in the movie. 4)Horrible lighting and CGI. The movie looks like they spent all their money hiring Will Smith, and had no money left for special effects. The majority of the movie is barely lit, which causes a lack of color, which messes with the tone. The CGI is well below average.5)The tone is lost somewhere in between light hearted and dark.6)Too much action. In the movie Batman: Assault on Arkham (which was much better than this) the squad breaks into Arkham Asylum, which is very entertaining, but in Suicide Squad, most of the mission is fighting. The majority of the movie is carried by action, which becomes very boring.7)Dialogue is poorly written. Throughout the movie, most of the things characters say are extremely bland and cliché. The final fight consists of cringe worthy and extremely off dialogue that will keep you asking ""What?""8)Many unanswered questions9)Huge lack of character motive10)Editing and pacing is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. It seems like this movie was actually well edited and consisted of full scenes, until Warner Bros. came in and edited it to hell. (Which is actually what happened)There were only two short parts in the movie I actually liked, the only things in this movie that I don't absolutely despise.Overall, this is one huge disappointing mess that is a huge disgrace to the superhero genre. DC fans and casual moviegoers alike deserve better then this.",Suicide Squad
1318,TheRatBoi,I gave it a chance and it spat in my face,1,15 January 2017,"I saw the trailers for this movie and I thought it looked like a confused mess that wasn't sure what it wanted to be. So already my expectations were pretty low, then the movie came out and certain movie review channels I watch gave it a very negative review. However, I decided to go in with an open mind and judge it for myself, and now after having seen it I can say that this movie has nothing and I mean absolutely nothing of value everything this movie does is wrong This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and it's pretty difficult to decide where to start but here we go. The Characters, there's about seven or eight of them and they are the worst part about this movie. Harley Quinn has been given a lot of praise but I honestly don't know why, I found her annoying, cringey and a pathetic representation of a classic character. Speaking about bad representations of great characters let's talk about Jared Leto's Joker. I thought he was embarrassing and it made me want to throw myself down the nearest set of stairs. like Harley Quinn he was cringeworthy and the worst thing ever and I'm glad he only got a small role in the film. Moving onto Will Smith played by Will Smith. I think Will Smith did a great job at playing Will Smith as he really captured all the charm and mannerisms of Will Smith. Captain Boomerang was the only character that was somewhat likable and he actually came close to having a funny scene. During the awful bar scene they're all told they can leave if they want and Captain Boomerang just walks out, this would be funny if he actually left and never showed up in the movie again but no they messed that up too by having him appear without any explanation in the very next scene. I'm not going to talk about any of the others as they were all undeveloped and boring.This movie should be given an award for the worst cinematography since AvP 2. I honestly could not see half of what was happening because the movie was so darkly lit and dull. For a movie that's trying to be Guardians of the Galaxy you would think it would make sense to use a brighter more vibrant colour palette, but instead they chose to go with the ever popular coal and concrete colour palette...my favourite. This is what I was talking about when I said the movie didn't know what it wanted to be. It's like they were going to do a more serious movie like BvS but after BvS got bad reviews for being too dark and ""not enough like Marvel"" they said OK let's try and reshoot this movie to make it more fun and comedic so you have this really weird blend of brightly coloured logos and fonts with Borderlands styled intros for the characters with popular songs (I'll get to that in a minute) on a darkly lit grim and ugly looking film and it doesn't work at all. Then you have the comedy and it's painful just really really painful, they tried to give Harley Quinn these Hilarious and quirky one-liners that fall flat every time, they made me embarrassed for me, embarrassed for Margot Robbie and embarrassed for everyone else in the movie theatre.The story was boring, forgettable, predictable and slow. The pacing in this movie is atrocious the movie spends like the first half an hour just getting started and introducing the characters and it's done in such weird way that feels like i'm watching five different trailers followed by half of a movie.Going back to this film's soundtrack. It's just a bunch of good songs put to scenes that don't fit it at all they play seven nation army, Without me and spirit in the sky all in the space of about two minutes, it is absolutely unbearable. It feels like they were trying to be Guardians of the Galaxy but in that movie the songs actually fit the tone and had a purpose outside of making people go, Oh hey! I like that song! wow this movie has such a great soundtrack I'm going to give it a ten out of ten because they played a song I like wow they're so talented what great filmmaking! A song should be used to leave you with a certain feeling or emotion I mean I shouldn't even have to explain this! This is basic stuff! If the only feeling a scene left me with was ""why did that song sound out of place?"" or ""that sounded really bad."" then you messed up! Redo the scene! Fix it! Do something! You can't just put good music or recognisable characters in famous costumes and clever little Easter eggs in your movie and think that it will make up for the: Bad audio, bad cinematography, bad acting, bad writing, bad special effects, bad lighting, bad story and some of the most appalling editing I have ever seen you can't expect people to think like that. People aren't that dumb...Oh wait. I've gone on long enough about this piece of filth so I'm going to wrap it up. Believe me I could have gone on longer but just thinking about this film gives me a headache, I would recommend watching reviews/videos by: Ralph the movie maker, I hate everything, your movie sucks and folding ideas. They go way more in detail then I ever could with this. I'm just glad that now I can finally never think about this movie ever again. Oh and if you want to see a good suicide squad movie then I would recommend assault on Arkham.",Suicide Squad
1319,adieldevilliers,Actually really good,8,8 August 2016,"I am getting so sick of critics. I really want critics to prove that they actually watched a movie, before they are allowed to comment on it. All critics critique according to Oscars standards, Oscars who are Racist, sexist and judged by peers. Oscar movies are not block busters that make money. So why are movies judged according to those standards? I use to like the Oscars, but as long as they split awards by gender, and only nominate white people, I will not give it any credit.So back to Suicide Squad, it was a solid good movie. It wasn't epic. More like a really good episode of Arrow. But it was enjoyable, with one of the best music soundtracks ever. Margot Robbie and Will Smith are amazing. Without a doubt the main characters. They carry the movie, and they do it well. Scott Eastwood was wasted as supporting cast, and Cara Delevingne might be the worst part of the movie. She was all wrong. I honestly hated her acting choices. The way she moved, the way she spoke, the way she even kissed her BF. It was just bad. But luckily she is only in a small part of the movie, and you can totally overlook her total mediocre performance. The whole middle part of the movie was stupid, and the detour to save Amanda Waller was a mistake. but it did give the story time for the squad to bond, and create a relationship. I would put it in the same box as ""Martha"" (BvS).I think anybody looking for action, fun, and epic music will enjoy this movie. It won't linger in your mind, but sometimes you just want to get on a ride and have some fun.",Suicide Squad
1320,uriel_gutierrez_tapia,A horrible production that serves as prevention,1,29 April 2017,"This film was supposed to be the salvation of the decadent DCEU (with just three films), however, only served to sink it more.How to start? Not only is it painfully written, but also horribly directed and that same makes the actors do a very bad job.The mistakes of the script of the film range from introducing anti-climatic and really forced jokes to errors of continuity, coherence, and cohesion. From the beginning of the film we began to see these problems, with the introduction of the characters and history (which finds its purpose until after an hour of suffering). It is at this point that, in addition to the purpose is unclear, the villain introduced is equally trash as the story of the film. A cliché villain easily defeated that only serves for ... really nothing. It serves the easy plot to have a villain who wants to conquer everything and after a battle with ""pium-pium"" and explosions and the destruction of the city and more stupid formula of an average superhero movie, is defeated.The characters have no chemistry between them. The team was formed very quickly and in this way as fast as any other mediocre film, they want to make us believe that they have very great emotional ties and are now ""family"" when they are people who met about two hours before and plus, threatened to work together.The attempt to make it ""funny"" but at the same time something dark and exciting means that instead of experiencing emotion and grace you experience pity for how horrible the script is, its performances and the way in which the action scenes are assembled. Not even the sound mix and the editing are good. The songs are put at the worst moment in the film, just to say ""oh, what a good soundtrack, you know, the old is cool"", but instead you wonder why that song sounds at that moment and you think it's the worst song For the worst moment. Summary: ""Suicide Squad"" is not only horrible in script and production, it is equally horrible in direction, technical and artistic aspects and gives us a cliché story with unbearable characters but this time, worse worked than a B- class movie. The only thing this film serves for is to alert the directors and producers of this genre of how not to do things and makes me miss the money I paid for the entrance of the cinema.",Suicide Squad
1321,LukeTitles,"Enjoyable, but poor story",6,4 August 2016,"The first thought I had as soon as the movie was over was: a lot of flesh and no bones.The acting is great, Margot Robbie is perfect and way out of reach of all the others, Will Smith being Will Smith is good, and Leto had the guts of bringing to us a new Joker (not better than others, just different). The soundtrack is really good. There are some jokes that cracked the theater. I liked the action scenes.All of this is what I call ""Flesh"".What is missing (the ""bones"") is a solid story, in a movie where the main characters are bad guys you need a really good antagonist and the movie fails in that. The movie spends the first part to introduce the characters and jumps directly to the main plot, that is so weak to be confused to a warm up mission. I didn't feel any tension, nor the movie made me care about what was happening on the screen. Yes, great characters, funny, but without a story to support them the risk to be a pointless movie, another expensive set up for the Justice League, is real.",Suicide Squad
1322,lachiesholl-86054,"DC, you've done it again (and not in a good way)",3,3 August 2016,"Suicide is another disappointing entry into the DCEU, as it threw away the potential for a fun, light-hearted story and instead replaced it with the dark tone (and some humour) we have come to expect from this film franchise. Will Smith is by far the best part of this movie, delivering us his usual, charismatic charm and addition to this, Margot Robbie, Jai Courtney and Viola are great in their roles respectively. Where the film falters in terms of performance however, is through Cara Delevingne's disappointing representation of Enchantress (in which she was given a role that was utilized in the story much more than expected/needed), Jared Leto as the Joker, where he just seemed to be doing a strange and unsettling impression of Heath Ledger's interpretation in his surprisingly small and compressed role and other side characters seemed entirely underused (for example, Katana, Slipknot (who was added to the team for the sake of moving the plot along) and Killer Croc). Also, unfortunately the relationship between the characters, Rick Flagg and Enchantress seemed entirely forced and just completely unnecessary. Onto the ""cool soundtrack"" that was promised prior to the film's release, it was was unfortunately very overused as the began to cut off song-after-song and just play another one straight after which had nothing to do with the plot at all (some did however, which was pleasing). One of the antagonists turned out to be nothing but a fake-looking, CGI sh*t-fest with no motivation other than he wanted to take over the world (learn from your mistakes DC!) and the dialogue written into the script felt lazy and clunky and a lot of the jokes were hit-or-miss.

All you get is Will Smith being Will Smith. The down guy who has a kid trying to make a living.He means well and he cares about his daughter as he is a weekend dad. Dialbo ( the fire guy) has the power to destroy everything yet he wants to be good wants to do good and dose not wanna use his ability for wrong.Turns into a big fire thing an then dies. WHAT!! Slipknot how long was this character on screen for? He appears out of now were and then dies. Soon as you see him you know he is there to die the first.Sort of a oh the thing we have on you works look. Harley Quinn-its as if they said to Margot Robbie just walk around in hot pants and say your lines in a soft girly voice . Done ..Leto-has to go down as the worse Joker ever.Rock Druggie with daddy issues.The laugh WTF!!! The Joker is not rich he dos not drive expansive cars and he dos not chill at nightclubs with other bad guys. The Joker is fared by everyone. Eyebrows were raised when Leto was announce as the joker. When people saw what he would look like you just knew it was gonna be a bad movie. Leto just dose not strike fair he is that soft cute rock singer. The Movie was made for the pop people of today.So no real backstory action and one liners. By the end the bad guys are shown as heroes. It was done for the Harley Quinn wannabes (mostly every girl who likes to dress up) . It felt like a teenage movie with old actors trying to be young or think hey this is my chance to be a comic book character . Now we all know what they can or should never be a comic book character.

The plot does have holes and it is rather stupid but the film is supposed to be stupid ! It's a villain film and is made for fun purely not for serious topics . Also everyone says Jared Leto is not a good joker but you have to give it to him that it's difficult to follow Heath ledger and he didn't do a bad job at all - In fact , I wish he was in it more ! Harley Quinn follows all expectations and delivers a strong role , the enchantress actually takes the main part which is misleading from trailers and doesn't do it in a bad way either . She didn't have to do a lot of 'acting' but did what she did well . As for dead shot I was quite disappointed because he wasn't really a villain - he was more vulnerable and mushy than expected . Captain boomerang and Katina really had no meaning and I found them pointless to the story as they really had no place nor lines . Over all it is was it is and that's a fun time - the movie know what it is and you should watch purely for entertainment- I love this movie and would go to 10 if it wasn't for Katina and boomerang.",Suicide Squad
1325,anxte,Hyped? yes. As bad as everybody says? not really.,6,29 August 2016,"I definitely am not a DC apologist, but this movie truly isn't as bad as some of the reviews say. (review includes spoilers)001. the actorsI feel as though the actors did the best with what was given to them, both script and direction-wise. Margot Robbie and Will Smith really held their own and all the other actors weren't half bad either. Although, Slipknot really was there just to give the feeling of some stakes, which ended up quite lackluster seeing as how he only has like 3 lines of dialogue and no introduction like all the other characters had.002. storyWell, here is where i have no idea what to say. It wasn't like the story was hard to follow, but something about it was just off - there were things that I felt were completely unnecessary and some bits where I needed some explanation from the DC fan I went to see it with. For one, the Joker was completely unnecessary throughout the movie, he could've just shown up at the end to set up the next Batman or whatever. I do however like the theory that's been floating around, about how the Joker is all part of Harley's imagination and how he's been dead for years.

1326,ucapoor,review,4,20 September 2016,"At one point in the slog that is ""Suicide Squad,"" Will Smith's character laments that he and his team of reluctant do-gooders must battle ""the swirling ring of trash in the sky."" That's a pretty apt description of the movie as a whole, too: It's massive, messy and noisy. And it stinks Part of the problem is that the powers that be within ""Suicide Squad"" view even their few interesting characters as disposable. If these guys fail, they die. If they bail, they die. The makers of the film itself haven't given us much reason to care about them, either. www.flickstree.com not only gives us a platform to get moves online but also helps in watching them online easily",Suicide Squad

Direction is the most important in a movie, and if not done properly, you end up making this. It had it funny moments but could have been a lot better. Joker was awesome.But there was too less of him. Hoping that the extended cut will be much better than the original one as the humour was totally off and dry.

Which, oddly enough, has more time on the screen than some of the casts faces.By the end of the movie, I could understand why. It is the best part of this movie.The story falls apart before it begins, is diabolically written and ends just in time for you to not hang yourself with your own underwear.Why do they make such terrible movies?

1330,plummetingparadise,Committing Career and Box office Suicide (Squad),4,1 November 2016,"Many of the recent superhero movies to come out have actually been of surprisingly good quality. The writing can be a little pedestrian, a little (verging on painfully) predictable given the level of self-awareness and emotional depth of the demographic it is produced for. Having said that, usually the writing is of such a quality as to allow us to at least appreciate the acting or, failing that, the neon pyrotechnic spectacle of effects unencumbered by clumsy, sophomoric narrative flailing.Suicide Squad bears no such considerations. The writing is so flagrantly unconcerned with its own substance as to be an indictment of the intelligence of the viewer - as if it was written out of the spite the writer feels for his own audience. The actors seem to sense this and end up either acting along out of impotent despair (as seen in professional pornography) or callously insulting indifference (as seen in crime re-enactments). Whatever the motives of those involved in nearly every aspect of this production the message of the movie is the same: the sarcastic yet sincere suggestion that the viewer who has consummated watching this film can only have done so out of a stupidity so comprehensive and abiding as to be unable to realize the threat it poses and so, for the good of all existence should commit suicide. There is no redemption for us, for by our willingness to endure such an obvious and grave insult to what is most noble within us we have tacitly endorsed the position that we deserve death, that we too have become irretrievably lost.There is only one way out now.

Viola Davis brought her straight into real life from the comics.I was bothered though that Warner Brothers missed the opportunity to show a great Joker by Jared Leto. I've seen the behind the scenes and I've seen Jared was giving a good Joker-performance backstage, but that's it. He had potential and now receives the hate he does not deserve simply because the production messed up.All in all, the modern and more realistic streetstyle take of Harley and Joker was, to me, a great idea and I had wished to see more of that in future movies. I also wasn't bothered at all by the romance between Harley and Joker as I see this just as another universe out of a dozen DC had come up with. It's an interesting 'what if' scenario after all and the extra scenes of their past matches the original story in some kinda way.Ps.: Katana felt like a not needed accessory though.",Suicide Squad
1337,nickspiros,Truly not good at all.,4,29 September 2018,Great cast and a big budget couldn't save this from being an inevitable flop by critics. There was just no substance to the story.

It was such an awful experience, one of the most irritating movies I have seen in a long time.Movies like Suicide Squad are supposed to be fun entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. Here we have such an uninspired mess of a film, with an awful script which is so inherently unfunny, it hurts. There is not one punchline that delivers, not one dialogue that creates even distant engagement to the story, not one character that makes me even superficially care what happens to them. Even fundamental characteristics like special effects are unimpressive at best, amateurish at worst. And I cannot say that I am in any way impressed by the acting, though the film features many big names. I do not believe it is their fault, though.Today, I have read a review of this movie in a German newspaper which was titled ""Better hit your head against the wall for two hours"". I cannot say that I disagree.",Suicide Squad
1340,jay-11199,Awful Plot of a Movie Saved By Harley Quinn,6,25 May 2020,"I really don't get Hollywood sometimes.Why always prioritize big name actors and special effects? If you want a good movie shouldn't priority number one ALWAYS be hire a good screenwriter.A movie without a good plot will inevitably fail, no matter how big the actors' names are or how great the special effects and action sequences are, not that those elements are unnecessary. Often these days they are. But they still need a story.Here the story concept was actually a good idea (as in the comics) and the actors, especially scene stealing Margot Robbie, did well bringing the iconic characters to life, but the story plot was a disaster, leaving these fine actors all over the place and ending with an overall mess of a movie. The STORY should always come first, even before production begins. You'd think Hollywood (or DC Films) would've figured that out by now.Nevertheless, despite my criticisms I'm rating this movie a six due to Margot Robbie's charismatic interpretation of Harley Quinn who is every bit the enjoyable psycho that she is in the comics. I actually prefer this crazier version of Harley in ""Suicide Squad"" than her somewhat more restrained portrayal in ""Birds of Prey."" Classic Harley is always a nutcase and is portrayed that way in comics and console games.Margot Robbie seems to know that that's what we love about her because - boy, did she ever hit the nail on the head with this interpretation, getting a comic book character as close to perfection as I've ever seen in a DC movie.",Suicide Squad

I was really looking forward to this, Will Smith looked like he could carry the cast and the trailers really made their job. Unfortunately the movie is weak...sometimes it looks like it's a ""look what I can do kind of documentary"" Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was good and funny enough to be a great Harley Quinn....Why am I addressing Deadshot and Harley? well because this was their show really, all other members are just here to support them. sadly (or not) Killer Croc, Katana, Cpt Boomerang, Flag and El Diablo are not the focus of the movie, the viewer is not led to care for them at all even with Diablo's ""special sharing moment""the first half drags itself around trying to introduce the characters but it lacks interest (apart from Harley and Mr J) even with some DC heroes making cameos. after the intros are made it goes on smoothly until the last part which was a let down for me.by the way, Jared Letos's Joker still comes out short when compared to the previous 2 jokers we had... he is hardly intimidating and quite sad to look at... he shouldn't have as much screen time as he does (which is not much but still) Some of the supportive characters were surprisingly more interesting than some members of the Suicide Squad and the Villain of the movie is quite frankly boring and very very predictable.as a ""super hero"" movie it OK at best, if it's on TV some time from now I will watch it but I probably won't make an effort to look for it actively.

Or the overall pace, and script, or just about anything else. I just saw the movie 10 min ago and it's literally painful to think about again. Maybe after I let the wounds heal for a while I'll be able to think more straight about it.I will say that the villain and her special effects were about the only entertaining thing in this whole movie.

Some other characters seemed utterly useless.The villains and the plot was so poorly written that I was thinking are these guys really this short of creativity!This movie was the least engaging movie that I have seen in a while.

1352,slave00,Suicide at the Box Office,3,7 August 2016,"I like all kinds of movies, cheesy B films to Oscar winning. OK, very few romantic comedies, I usually don't like those. I liked Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. I go into a film with the mindset of how a film is marketed, as to how much of my brain to turn off to enjoy it. Now you know what level I'm on, I didn't like Suicide Squad. With a very thin plot and even thinner characters, this movie does not live up to the hype. Will Smith brought his game but could not save the lackluster, boring film. Leto brought nothing entertaining to the Joker. Harley was the comic relief, even though what she said may have been funny in the right context, the lines were delivered at inappropriate times. The pacing was awful, the characters were uninspiring, the villains were boring, the dialogue was boring, the whole movie was just pretty much a disaster. The people who put the trailers together know how to entertain. Unfortunately, the X minutes of trailers we got before the release were all the good parts taken from the movie. When those parts were put back in, they lost their luster.Watch Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy again if you want to be entertained, this DC outing has nothing to offer. Both my wife and I did not enjoy this film. We dressed as Harley and the Joker for Halloween a couple of years ago, we won't be repeating that ensemble. On the flip side, our 12 year old son thought it was amazing. He also thinks $5 Hot and Ready pizza and Pokemon tournaments are amazing. Watching Suicide Squad, I felt I was watching a generic, straight to DVD, rip-off of some recent Marvel scenes mixed with the original Ghostbusters. This is hard pressed to even be suggested as a rental. Hopefully WB will slow down and start doing things right. They have rights to something that can make them a contender, but not if they keep shoveling their ...stuff in the current direction.",Suicide Squad
1353,TateDGibbs,"""Suicide Squad"" made me wanna hang myself...",1,20 August 2016,"I'm not a fan of superhero films in general (a handful of exceptions do exist), but I was feeling (stupidly) optimistic for Suicide Squad. I went with my friends to see it, and while they admired parts of it and were able to have a good laugh about it, I couldn't. I didn't enjoy one second of the two hours I was in that seat. My eyes eventually began to water...I was the only person in the theater who didn't enjoy it.Everything about the film felt fragmented, and whether or not that was the intention is irrelevant to me, because I wouldn't have liked it either way. The soundtrack consists almost entirely of hit songs... clichéd songs (songs that I actually love by themselves).The acting wasn't bad at all, but it always felt odd and off. I'm not doubting the talent of this cast because I've seen just about all of them play an amazing role elsewhere. I don't even want to get started on the humor. I'm no prude when it comes to comedy, but for the entire two hours of run time, I didn't even crack a smile. To me, the most entertaining part was my buddy quietly singing along to the songs as he set beside me, wholly immersed. Action scenes were typical, predictable, and not very creative; just typical superhero movie fight scenes. As a whole, the film is so predictable that you could probably guess what's going to happen scene-by-scene as the story progresses.As mentioned previously, this movie was so boring. Had I gone by myself, I would have definitely walked out probably the halfway point. I didn't feel invested. I didn't feel interested. I felt absolutely nothing.You might be wondering as to why I gave SS a bonus star. It definitely tried, and I recognize a lot of the talent and effort that went into some of the special effects and makeup. I really couldn't give it much credit for anything else. The bonus star is for the production. Unimpressive, movie. I know there are many people who also despise this movie, but it's in all honesty a very polarizing piece. You have to see it to make an actual decision, but I can certainly tell you where I stand. If you enjoyed it, kudos to you. I simply couldn't, despite really, really wanting to.

Explosion didn't look so powerful...Why at her final appearance Amanda Waller had her fingers on the touch screen of her phone and this didn't kill anyone? Who gave Harley a cell phone? And did't spy her communication at least?

1355,greytree,David Ayer directing was the main problem with this one...,1,1 August 2016,Just saw a preview screening of this and have to say it was mediocre at best. It had character chemistry however that's really all. And jam packing all these villains didn't make it any better although the trailer made it seem it was going to be epic.. To me the main problem with this movie was the way it was directed. It felt very compact and if you are familiar with Ayers other movies and watch this you will see exactly what I mean. There is no sense of spacial awareness and moves from scene to scene without much depth or anything to have you wishing you could go back to watch that part again. Pretty much the whole movie was like this so yeah will not be watching this for maybe at least another 2 years and that's a maybe.

1358,edbk,A lot better than the critics make you believe,7,5 August 2016,"Reading all the official reviews from the critics, I assumed Suicide Squad was going to be as awful as BvS. But on the contrary, this movie doesn't have big gaps in the story like BvS and it's fun as well. But they could've done a lot better though.I really enjoyed the character introduction. Especially for viewers not so familiar with DCEU, this was a nice touch. Personally, found it a little strange that they didn't introduce Slipknot. Even though he got killed in nearly his first scene, it would've made a bigger impact when he got his own introduction as well. After the introductions, the movie slowed down a bit and got slightly more serious.Will Smith and Margot Robbie were clearly the stars in this movie. Will Smith as Deadshot, as always, portraying el savior and Margot Robbie did an amazing job as the psychotic Harley Quinn. The chemistry between Harley Quinn and the Joker were great to watch and I can't wait to see if the two of them are getting their own spin off. According to the rumors, many scenes of the Joker were cut out off the movie. That's a shame, because although the screen time of Jared Leto was too short, he positively contributed to the movie. Then there's Enchantress... Out of all the villains in DCEU, they chose her... Her story was too obvious, the CGI wasn't that good and it kind of reminded me of the final scene of 2015's Fantastic Four when they fight Dr. Doom. Not a movie you want to be compared with. Choosing another villain and creating a better story around the villain would have easily added another point to the total of this movie. So all in all, the movie is not bad at all. Some jokes may come over a little too forced, but others will have you going. Some decisions should've been altered, as putting more of the Joker in the movie, choosing another villain and maybe go R-rated like Deadpool instead of PG-13. They are villains right?!And oh, please make up your mind for the next movie, either give Killer Croc a smaller head or give him a bigger body.

Couldn't understand who the hell is the enchantress' brother and his connection to her, and they barely appeared in like 1/4 of the movie, didn't care much about them. - Not enough focus on the special abilities of each member of the squad and what makes them special and different from each other. - Not enough Joker presence, but I understand he wasn't supposed to be over-present in the movie.Joker was great for me and Harley Quinn is the best in the movie. Viola Davis (Waller) and Will Smith delivered outstanding performances.",Suicide Squad
1360,Rinette,"Colourful, trashy fun",7,8 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is visually stunning with some great performances. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are fantastic as Deadshot and Harley Quinn and are the two characters that are paid the most attention, and whose backstories we see the most of. However, that doesn't mean the rest of the cast aren't as interesting and fun to watch. Jai Courtney did a nice job as Captain Boomerang and was actually pretty entertaining. Cara Delevigne is good as Enchantress, though she wasn't a stand-out like Robbie, and Jay Hernandez did a great job as El Diablo; he brought an unexpected heart to the team. Jared Leto's Joker was a wild card, and not as prominent as fans were expecting. However, his joker was a lot of fun. He admirably portrayed the Joker's complete psychosis and brought a colourful Mob Boss aesthetic, in contrast to Ledger and Nicholson's portrayals. Some people won't be a fan of Leto's Joker, but I found him engaging and want to see more of him. The film is very action heavy which, while entertaining and beautifully shot, was to the detriment of the plot and pacing of the rest of the movie. Background information had to be revealed to the audience through characters telling other characters, rather than have it play out visually and naturally, and there were flash-backs spread liberally throughout the film because there wasn't enough time evolve the events linearly. The flashbacks weren't uninteresting to watch, but there were so many of them that they did make the film feel disjointed and a little patch-work.Overall, I give Suicide Squad 7/10.

I dare say that, if you had caught this at the theater, and you like the genre, then you would have walked out happy to have seen it. I will buy the CD.

Boomerang's sequence is good too, especially because it gives us The Flash. Then you got to El Diablo and Killer Croc and the sequences almost bore me, until the movie really starts with the main villain resurrected and wreaking havocs. Then the team is assembled and we go into over drive. Along the way, friendships are made, notably Deadshot and Flag's tense-filled camaradie. Harley and Deadshot's almost flirt each other, but Harley's heart is still with The Joker. Deadshot has many great action sequences, notably when he makes the last man standing atop a car, mowing down the black goo zombies. But he feels more like Will Smith than Deadshot to me. Arrow's Deadshot is the better portrayal. Harley has many opportunities to show her antiques and psychotic quirks, but her intelligence still shows. She is described as even more psychotic than Joker. She and Deadshot carry the movie.The other character that surprisingly shines is El Diablo. Starting as reluctant to show off his power, his action sequences make key moments in the movie possible. Even his remorse and his guilt shows through his acts in the movie.I was expecting Captain Boomerang to be a joke character, but he actually becomes the something more. He always tries to find ways to cut ties with the group, with smart quips and whisperings, but in the end he tags along. Killer Croc and Katana both suffer from poor screen times. The times they are on the spotlight are spent nicely though, as they have their own crucial moments that move the plot forward in the movie, especially Croc and his ability to swim fast and long underwater.Flag and Enchantress are the plot devices of the movie, but they are portrayed nice enough, especially Enchantress and her swift madness.The only thing I hate about this movie is actually the Joker's antics. It feels that he shouldn't in the movie this much, especially sabotaging things the way he does and just get away like that. Waller should have find ways to make him part of the operations.",Suicide Squad
1363,dgohmann,Embarrassingly bad,1,6 August 2016,"This movie is embarrassingly bad. The plot makes no sense, the characters beyond Deadshot and Harley Quinn are criminally underwritten, and the whole thing is just embarrassing to watch. The villain is so cartoonish and thinly written you'd think you were watching an old Ghostbusters cartoon. I feel bad for everyone involved with this. The editing of this film is some of the worst I've seen and the dialogue is pathetic. This is Green Lantern bad. I miss the days of Nolan's Batman trilogy when Warner had competent people running a franchise. What they are doing now is truly awful, and I hope this movie tanks after its massive opening weekend.",Suicide Squad
1364,Jamesymontana,Starts well and gets progressively worse,5,6 August 2016,"I went to see this after hearing a few bad reviews, I was always going to see it at the cinema anyway in the hope that I would enjoy it as I have most of the comic book films. When it started they built up the characters well and it had a good mix of humour and action, but it went down hill quickly after the start. I thought Margot Robbie stole the show with Will Smith not far behind they were true to their characters in the comics and without them I would have left the cinema early. I hated the version of the Joker that Jarrard Leto portrayed, what he was trying to do was nothing like the vision I have ever had for the Joker, I have always been sceptical when a different actor takes on this role but have always been impressed until now. I hope there are no more of these films, but it would be good to get Margot Robbie playing Harlequin again in a Batman film.",Suicide Squad
1365,brunoscunha,Cool movie,7,5 August 2016,"I really did enjoy watching this movie. Had a great start and then.... there are some parts did have some consistency issues. Some great action scenes and others were just bad. In my opinion the main issue was the editing and some characters consistency. Overall I really did enjoyed it. Perhaps a directors edition later on?? But yes much more entertaining than Batman vs Superman, but still has to grow more to be able to face marvel movies, but they are on the right track. The soundtrack is also an issue here. In some parts it's great and in others is.... like I don't know what there were thinking about. The soundtrack is on the line of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and in general I liked it.",Suicide Squad
1366,hannahshimwell,Don't set the bar too high,7,5 August 2016,"The film itself was probably better than I expected, I didn't go in with high hopes and I came out pleasantly surprised. The story was alright and the casting was average, Will Smith stuck out as the best cast in the entire film, Margot Robbie was decent but I didn't rate Jared Leto as The Joker. It felt like a Will Smith film and I came out thinking that if he wasn't in it then it could have easily been a 5/10 instead. Cara Delevingne was the worst cast in the whole film, she felt too small to play the Enchantress and the whole film she was in this mist of smoke which didn't work well. The soundtrack was really good and I feel the film would have lost another aspect if the soundtrack wasn't as good.",Suicide Squad
1367,peter-wilson,"Very good, but not excellent",8,6 August 2016,"The trailers were 12 out of 10, absolutely amazing. I'm not a big superhero fan, but while the plot was typically weak, it was better than most superhero movies. In my opinion the movie ranges between good and excellent... ultimately, its lacks some polish but is certainly worthwhile. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis are excellent, while Jared Leto's performance as The Joker is mixed with some very convincing scenes and also some underwhelming efforts. Importantly, the characters are much more interesting and likable than Marvel's current stable, and I expect the sequel will have a better director, editor and soundtrack, and possibly a better plot which makes this movie a worthwhile and enjoyable prelude to something very special down the line, especially with a likely improved performance from Jared Leto as The Joker.",Suicide Squad
1368,tawaab,Simply pathetic,2,26 September 2019,Such brilliant cast and big budget and yet they failed to made a decent movie. Action sequences were simply woeful and humour was somehow shady. Plus it had the worst joker i would say,Suicide Squad
1369,SirSaeed,"The Characters are great, but the story and damn director..",8,14 August 2016,"If there wasn't for the great advertising and good character players for Deadshot and Harley Quinn, this movie was a catastrophic box office failure! The Joker character was vague in the movie you could barely sense its existence, which for such a great movie full of super villains I think it was a bad idea to make just a small side love story for him, not in the main story, as if you delete the Joker scenes, there wouldn't be any noticeable change for the whole movie.. Anyways, it was the problem of the Writer of the movie, which is the same person as the Director of the movie! I really think of the parallel world which on it the Hollywood Producers decided differently, the Suicide Squad movie has been Directed by Christopher Nolan or Quentin Tarantino, just think for a second, such a great movie it could be! There were so many problems with the story line and scenes which shows how a weak writer and director could make a disaster out of a great movie idea! For example, he just don't pay attention to the details and thinks audience wouldn't notice too, in the last encounter of the Suicide Squad with the Enchantress what happens to those Big Guardian soldiers beside the Enchantress? Thay suddenly disappear and only her brother remains! If you decided to remove them from the movie why you showed them in the previous scene right before the Squad entering to the Main hall? Almost half of the movie spent on introducing the Suicide Squad and they were supposed to defend the country against some probable super power, but suddenly, such a lame story is that! One of the members of the previously introduced as the Suicide Squad becomes the one which they should fight against! Anyways.. Let's talk about the perfect Character in the movie, Harley Quinn, I think almost half of the audience attraction was for her great role playing, one of her cool quotes: ""we're the bad guys, this is what we do!"", I loved her personally, because her favorite cocktail was the same one as I love, ""Adios Mother F.."", Deadshot was another perfect character, you wouldn't remember so much of the other characters after finishing watching the movie.. By the way there is a last scene in the end of the movie after animation cast.. Don't miss, it is for the next sequel of the movie..",Suicide Squad
1370,amlh-398-218596,Movie should have had a different TITLE,10,16 September 2016,"The trailers were hilarious!!! Laughter is the best medicine. I smiled and laughed and felt good like perhaps, Milton Berle may have written some of the dialogue. This is what entertainment is about. Remember folks this is fiction, no need to compare whatever to reality! It's a dark subject matter, and therefore comedy is important. Thus, I would have had fun with the title and renamed it THE DEPLORABLES. For example, if MEET THE PARENTS were a drama, would it be as good as a the movie? Laughter is the best medicine, especially with this subject matter--those who are may not be playing with a full deck. We love them, though, because they are the ones that change the world.",Suicide Squad
1371,gundamdestiny,"Good start, falls apart later",5,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was a film I was not looking forward to after the disaster known as Batman V Superman. As a fan of comics and also as a movie goer, this movie fails on many levels but manages to achieve some things.The Suicide Squad form together to fight Enchantress and her cgi army, they're built up of a bunch of baddies.The start is good but the intros definitely went to long, throughout the story though Will Smith's Deathstroke and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn are really the main characters, everyone is just supporting i guess. The story becomes quite repetitive and boring after the first half of the film. Once the action starts, a brief break, then back to the action. A formula I don't believe is good enough for a film like this. However this film was more humorous than Batman V Superman, which made it much better in my opinion, I was always excited to see Captain Boomerang as I knew he would always have a joke lined up.Joker Jared Leto's Joker appearance is too short for me to make any sort of judgement but from what I saw he was Okay, not as good as Ledger or Nicholson.This film was better than Batman V Superman mainly because it has more action, and its more light hearted. Will Smith did an alright job, but Margot Robbie really shined as Harley Quinn as she did a very good portrayal of the character.P.S Killer Croc looks so stupid",Suicide Squad
1372,piyushchhabra,"Great characters and performances, inconsistent storytelling.",6,5 August 2016,"Is it really as bad as the critics are making it out to be? No. But it is not too good either. It is the worst DCEU film and comparable to the lower-rated MCU films. And I will put forth why I think so.Before I start my actual review, I want to mention that I loved BvS (Ultimate Cut) and really liked Man of Steel and believe that both these movies are very harshly judged.Okay, through this review I will give my thoughts on the major things that have been pointed out by the critics.1. Characters: Once you reflect on it, this really is about the characters.a) Deadshot: Pretty good. Will Smith plays a role similar to the roles he's played before. But he brings a certain level of gravitas to the film. The character has a good arc, albeit a little cheesy but this is a really good performance.b) Harley Quinn (and The Joker): Fantastic. Margot Robbie knocks it right out of the park. There is not one dull moment whenever she's on-screen. There are some scenes in which the nuance in her performance really shows. Her arc was, unexpectedly, very emotional. Also, the criticism that she's a male fan boy's wet dream unwarranted. She is above all else, a psychiatrist and she knows what will attract the attention of the people she's with. She's not just the female equivalent of the Joker. There are layers to the character, and the film nails it. Speaking of the Joker, I didn't write a separate piece for him simply because everything he does in the movie is somehow related to Harley. That said, Leto is pretty good too, bringing to life a very different Joker than previously seen. He is simply not given enough time to shine, and I am very hopeful. The thing that is probably the best about this movie is the relationship between The Joker and Harley.c) Diablo: A complete surprise, this character is given a good arc and we totally understand his motivation behind every act of his. Besides Deadshot, Harley Quinn and the Joker, Diablo is easily the most impactful.d) Amanda Waller: The bad-ass, puppet master, even though the character is a little underwritten. Viola Davis makes the best of whatever lines she's given, even though some of them weren't great. But justice was done to this character too. She could've made a much more interesting villain than the one we got, but we'll get to that.e) Captain Boomerang: The comic relief is barely given an arc in this, but damn, he was funny! Jai Courtney seemed to have a lot of fun! f) Killer Croc: Make-up work was great, but was disappointing. He barely does anything in much of the movie and is very underwritten, considering that he is one of the two 'meta-humans' on the team.g) Katana: Another underwritten character, but she's okay I guess. Does have a couple of decent scenes.h) Rick Flagg: Surprisingly effective, is not simply an errands-boy as Deadshot calls him one time. Has a commanding but not overpowering screen presence. His dynamics with Waller, Deadshot and Enchantress are good.i) Enchantress: The worst thing about the film. After a cool introduction and some dramatic beats with Rick Flagg, the whole Enchantress stuff just nosedives and never recovers. It's a pathetic attempt, really. And the acting was really inconsistent too.2. Structure: When the critics say the structure is messy, they are absolutely spot-on. The movie starts with character intros beginning with trading-card like information and flashbacks with psychedelic, neon tinted images and abrupt editing. It was too sensory for me at first but then it started growing on me. I like experiments and I appreciate a film that tries to be different. But this tone is dropped midway and the gritty second act comes in and it just starts feeling like a different movie and then it becomes a weird, fantastical story in the third act. The villain is so lame that an act of destroying a subway train is actually more effective than one involving destruction of the world, blah-blah-blah.3.Tone: Since the structure is so disjoint, the tone of the movie is jarringly inconsistent. The film is very unsure of what it wants to be. It starts as a prison movie-video game montage-music video, then turns into a zombie movie, then finally turns into a fantastical tale. It has elements romance tries too hard to be funny at times. Now don't misjudge, a movie can perfectly be all those things, and a lot of these scenes in this work very well independently, but the transition is very rough. It's almost as if the whole movie is a big lengthy trailer, which is mostly due to bad editing.4. Music and Score: A lot of the critics have pointed out that the music feels as a cheap attempt to mimic the successful use in Guardians of the Galaxy. But I never found the music too noticeable and I believe it actually added to the story in certain parts. There is just one Eminem song which feels out of place and tacked on. The score is decent though.5. Plot: Pretty much non-existent. The whole movie is mostly just exposition. But I didn't particularly mind that. In fact, I kind of liked the small-movie vibe of it where everything in the movie exists to showcase various facets of each character.6. Villain: The villain in the movie is too generic to even talk about, so I'm going to talk about the real villains here.Warner Bros. executives.In spite of all this, I think the film is an enjoyable experience and the general audiences might enjoy it more than BvS. I am really excited to see some of these fascinating characters in more (and hopefully better) movies in the future.",Suicide Squad
1373,alien34532,My review,6,16 August 2016,"Let me tell you my opinion about the movie. Suicide Squad was an alright movie to watch. There were ups and downs for it. Let me start with the ups. All the actors were great in the movie, Jared Leto did a great job as the Joker, The Margot Robbie did a good job as Harley Quinn in the Movie, The other actors did a good job with their roles in the movie. My only down is that some scenes were not really that necessary for the movie. It look like some parts of the movie were cut and in my opinion it didn't need to remove certain scenes for the movie. Well this is my opinion of the movie. It's just an alright movie but not great.",Suicide Squad
1374,shailendra-singh435,a failed attempt,5,26 August 2016,A film that tried to do something different in terms of superhero movie genre but failed to accomplish what we already have on this. It seems that superhero movies are gonna stay low for a very long time. Probably one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in a theater. Except the dark knight trilogy which changed our perception towards this genre by its masterful presentation of characters and story accompanied by brilliant acting. the problem with the film was that it went too much supernatural while most of the good(bad) characters do not fall into that category. Its a pity that it wasted talents of some good actors in it. Suicide squad really is bad from starting to end. Worst DC movie ever made.,Suicide Squad
1375,sarahedgewrites,"Still succeeds despite that one, huge shortcoming",7,4 August 2016,"And by one, huge shortcoming I mean that PG-13 rating.Wow, if ever a rating killed the potential a film had it would be this one. What an R rating could have done for this film, well... We'll all have to imagine it somewhere in the back burner of our fan-tasies.Despite that oh so obvious attempt to make the PG-13 rating work, it still has merit in being just a fun, hot mess of a film.The film gets things rolling very well right from the start. It's not a slow build up. Nice to finally see the scenes from the trailer in the correct order (probably not in the order you thought). Introduced are Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Boomerang, Diablo, Killer Croc, Enchantress and a host of other characters. For a cast this size, I'm impressed that the film neatly managed to squeeze screen time for every character without throwing any under the bus. What's more it managed to make us feel for the characters. That would also be a challenge for a cast this big, to zero in on and focus on their deeper personas, but the film manages to do so effectively particularly with Harley Quinn and Deadshot, who by the way, are the film's best characters. Margot Robbie deserves a few award nods for her take on Harley Quinn.As the trailers implied, the film gathers them up and spits them out in front of an enemy no one is prepared to deal with. They have just the right amount of devil may care attitude to carry out the job. This is where the film weakens a bit. Yeah, it's a scary foe, but we're left wondering, ""With an enemy that fierce, where's the panic? Where's the wider sense of something going horribly horribly wrong."" We never really get a broader scope of what it implies for the rest of the world. We see it purely from the angle of the insiders.This ""insider view"" is constant and consistent throughout the entire film. Whatever the world is seeing (something we often get in most comic book films) we're not seeing it. Everything is from our anti-heroes' point of view. This is one of the things that separates Suicide Squad from other films. It paints a dark but rosy outlook that we often don't see in most comic book films.In the end this is a very character-driven film. The action sequences work well, funny bits here and there, but if your'e not rooting for these guys by the end, you're obviously not a fan of interesting characters.One thing I'd like to add. Zack Synder's fingerprints are all over this film (making a film into one long music video is basically his signature), but luckily there are very few slow motion scenes.",Suicide Squad
1376,wazzic,EXTENDED version SAVES the movie!!!,9,15 November 2016,"Much like the success of the Batman v Superman EXTENDED version, the re-release of Suicide Squad is a sure-footed, spectacular story. It is more visually transfixing, increasingly good, and an evolutionary step forward in storytelling. Everything critics complained about the Joker is fixed as all his deleted scenes now included. More humor and character background restlessly are added amid the high-flying action. Katana initially seemed to unnecessary added, but now she has more backstory and her sword plays a bigger role in the climax. There are more Batman scenes with Killer Croc and Harley Quinn. The fifteen minutes added to the Joker and Harley Quinn subplot brings a new light to their relationship and their three-way conflict with Batman. This is the brilliantly clever movie that should have been released in the first place. DC's extended releases are redemption to the studio cuts. This is the winning movie fans were hoping to see.",Suicide Squad

1380,HyBarry,What the hell did I just watched?!,5,6 August 2016,"I really wanted to like this movie and I went in the theater with low expectations, having heard it was not that good...There is no spoiler to be spoiled because the story is thinner than air. There is nothing to talk about on the story.To me, the worst part is the armature skills on the editing. There are just too many shots that felt out of place or down right confusing. They can't even handle a lot of the action sequences correctly. I have heard they went back to re-shoot for some scenes already but I am saying the re-shoot didn't really saved the movie.All in all a bad experience and I can't really remember the last time I felt bored 1/2 way thru.It is very unfortunate for the cast. They seemed trying hard to do a decent job. At the end they will suffer in their own careers because of this bad production.Katana's Japanese is also pretty bad. She didn't speak it well enough to cut it as a native speaker.David Ayer is sooooo fired. I won't watch any movie directed by him. Thanks but no thanks.",Suicide Squad

Those entities could have ended all mankind in a blink, but some hot mentally unstable girl with a baseball bat and her team somehow manages to stop them.The joker: Jared Letho, awful. Hated every scene with him. Harlequin: yet interesting character in Batman games, dull and annoying in this movie. The fire guy: immense powers but useless until the end, bad acting, could not feel any connection to it. Deathshand: If it wasn't for Will Smith, I would have quit the movie after 15 minutes. All other characters are non-important, non memorable, bad acting and have nothing to do with the entire movie. Weller: just please...hated every scene with her.2 hours wasted of my life.

1383,victoura56,"Not trash, but neither treasure.",7,6 August 2016,"For the record, I wish to state that I don't read the comics, my interest in these characters is casual. I was excited for this film, hoping that it would be the break DC and Warner needed to perhaps challenge the Marvel machine. When this film came out and the news trickled down to me that it just another disappointment, I almost chose not to see it.I'm glad I saw it anyway. Those that say this movie is a disaster are over reacting. I'm not saying it's perfect; the first act is weighed down with lengthy introductions of the Squad. It does have a problem with pacing and focusing attention where it should. Harley Quinn and Deadshot get layers of attention and backstory, while some characters are simply thrown in. I must mention Jared Leto. Some complain he doesn't leave a huge impression and falls flat; I argue no. The Joker is not a member of the Suicide Squad, therefore not a main player of the movie. Sure, we all like to see plenty of Joker, but Harley Quinn takes the spotlight, as she should. This is HER movie, not his. And hey, we can't all be Heath Ledger's Joker.Overall, I enjoyed it. I hope they bring out the promised Harley Quinn spin off.",Suicide Squad
1384,dontbesyai-901-781938,BEST.... Marketing Campaign EVER!!!,6,3 August 2016,"Before I start, please note that I'm fan of of Batman and Superman, they were my childhood heroes! So consequently I'm also into anything that relates with those super heroes. It also drives to go to the premier of Suicide Squad even names like Amanda Weller, Rick Flag, Deadshot, El Diablo, Killer Crock, and Enchantress not so familiar to my ears. Although I'm well acquainted with the Joker and his love interest Harley Quin.But what were really drag me to see the movie was the series of the trailers. The trailers were so intense and so promising that the movie would like the antidote for gloomy and bad reviews. They were so colorful, more bright in tone, and the soundtracks! Oh, they are hell great of the movie soundtracks after (no offense) Guardians of the Galaxy, which I played for almost whole week prior the premier! I couldn't stop repeat to sing ""You Don't Own Me...""Now, when it come to the movie, well, I kind of 'yeah, okay, but...' I won't spoil anything but I could tell you this, the movie needs stronger reason to glue those bad guys into a single frame, or should I say they need more evil enemy rather than picking up something or someone that already exist. Well, there! I said it.I felt that David Ayer should set up a problem before they created a solution rather than making up some problem after a solution were already being created. It's just, for me, comical. Even the movie taking the event after the death of Superman, I just felt that they are irrelevantly connected to the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, unless the mid-credit, which to me the true connection to the next DC movie.Now I now that DC or Warner Bros has best marketing team which transform the 'yeah, okay, but...' movie into something 'you-must- see-this' movie. I should raise my glass to that. It's a hard- working process and harder when the movie has no certain point to expose but series of interesting characters but have not-so-much interesting reason to be in the scene.So my advise to all DC fans, please don't expect too much, just enjoy the movie with not setting any goal afterward. It will be better. It's only 123 minutes. Cheers!",Suicide Squad
1385,cmegala,Only 2 good things came out of this movie.,6,8 August 2016,"There was everything to suggest this would be the movie of the year and nothing to suggest it delivered. I loved the trailers and the concept was good but it never amounted to much.First and foremost there was the shoddy plot line. Then the mediocre acting followed by about a thousand clichés. Will Smith was supposedly one of the bad guys but he was basically Will Smith in every Will Smith movie. Think Will Smith in Hancock, that's what DeadShot was. His origin story wasn't too great either. Jared Leto's joker was a disappointment. Granted he had to follow a tough act in Heath Ledger, David Ayer didn't help and neither did his supposed 'death' do much to help the film (like they're just gonna kill off the Joker). Cringe is the only way to describe his performance. With a whole lot of cuts and generic jokes intertwined with cliché moments and an average plot line, probably not worth seeing it in cinema. Of course if the kids are desperate or just want to watch a superhero movie without much depth, then Suicide Squad fits the bill.The reason I gave it a 6 is because of the great soundtrack and Harley Quinn. Soundtrack was great with good songs but that's about all that needs to be said. Margot Robbie however did a great job in portraying the real Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie alone lifts the entertainment value at least by half. It would be wise for them to have a separate Harley Quinn movie.Overall the each scene was shot as if it were a trailer, there wasn't much continuity, the origin stories weren't compelling and the overall plot and execution was pretty ho-hum.",Suicide Squad
1386,troybutcher77,"Great Start, but Quickly Falls Apart",5,10 August 2016,"This movie had so much potential, with such a great cast, but the editing and 'movie climax' derailed it. I would give the first half of the movie a 7.5/10, but the last 1/3 or 1/4 a 3/10. WB needs to learn that every movie doesn't have to be about 'taking over the world'. This could just have been about the city, and the characters, without trying to cram 'saving the world' into all of their movies like BvS.The main villains in this movie, which you don't see in the trailers (very smart by the trailer editors so that people would come see the movie), are kind of goofy, and the ""final battle"" with them felt like I was watching Michael Bays TMNT or T4 slow motion fight scenes. If they would have cut the end villains out of this movie, and stuck with a the joker as the villain and gone a bit darker, it could have been great.",Suicide Squad
1387,supershawan,flat,3,7 February 2020,"Fell wayyy too flat, characters remained undeveloped, including the antagonists; dialogue was mediocre and at times insufferable; plot lacks originality and depth. Not a good Friday night watch.",Suicide Squad
1388,wendimac,enjoyable and fun,5,7 August 2016,"There are some spoilers in this but not many and this review is just my opinion. First the the bad the plot is messy and confusing at times that had a lot to do with editing, I fairly sure that there well be an extended cut on the DVD which will fill in some of the massive holes in the plot. Some of the dramatic pauses were unnecessary. The ending of the film was just bad and blatantly a set up for the next film. What this movie has got going for it is good characters, good special effects and great music and thankfully a 15 not a 12a. There is one member of the squad and (I think you can guess who that is) who was pointless and was the sacrifice to make a point. Margots performance as Harley Quinn was great, Jay as Diablo was pretty great as well. As for Will and viola his is not as bad as you think he is and she is just as bad as you think she is, I think killer croc and katana were unused, Joel as Rick flag was OK, first time for me seeing Cara acting I think she did a pretty good job more as the enchantress than June moone. The joker just out of his tree freaky I think Jared had fun playing the role, Jai a lot of the time in roles misses the mark but in this he really pulled it off. The action sequences and fight scenes were really cool. The suicide squad are not really against each other (apart from katana) but by the end they consider themselves friends and are even welling to help flag go up against his girlfriend because using her a weapon was a bad idea.",Suicide Squad
1389,mostafaamr2000,It was good but poor work from David Ayer,6,16 August 2016,"We were all waiting for this to hit the theaters and we had very high expectations that this would be a major change in superhero moviesThe first half was excellent and introduced the characters properly and had more Amanda Waller which made it better But at some point after seeming to be going to the right direction it turned to what i really expected which was traditional superheroes movie fighting the villain and so on, and it seemed way too predictable by that time, but at least i can say it was excitingThe villain was just too weak and didn't really make the effect i expected and this is just your typical superhero movie antagonistThe acting was great and particularly from Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn she owned the movie with her excellent turn Will smith was great as deadshot but i got to question this weird career move to just be deadshot after all this fame and time Viola Davis absolutely nailed it as Amanda Waller I never liked Jai Courtney or bought in his acting but this time he really surprised me with a great performance as captain boomerang Diablo wasn't given much screen time which is disappointing Killer Croc was absolutely useless and was there just as a killing machine Joel Kinnaman was very good though Cara Delevingne was very disappointing here and it made me question her acting even though she wasn't given much of a chance here Batman's cameo was coolFirst of all don't compare Jared Leto's take on the joker to Heath Ledger's iconic performance because both characters are entirely different even though they should be the same but this one wasn't the joker we know, he just looked like a 1930s gangster and Jared Leto did the most he could with this poor take on the joker, the makeup and look for the joker was the worst and it was just disappointing to see that you put the joker in a movie for 10 mins of screen time and be used as a subplot to Harley QuinnVery poor directing from David Ayer although i saw him promising and could deliver after 'Fury' but i could say he should have made it different from mainstream superheroes movies and the stakes should have been higher because it is called 'suicide squad' and this was just a mission that special ops would have finishedPoor screenplay that never helped the movie achieve its goal but that all comes back to David Ayer Cinematography was OK Music felt so wrong at some point because it never fitted in these moments or in this movie evenBatman V. Superman was way much better than this oneNeedless to say this was a major disappointment but in the end i would say it was good and DC has to improve if they want to catch-up with their arch rivals Marvel",Suicide Squad
1390,kenubu,Stop taking movies too seriously,7,15 September 2016,"First of all, i found that suicide squad was entertaining. It wasn't mind blowing entertaining like Civil War or Ant-man, but it was fun to watch and i didn't feel cheated of my money. I have watch the animated suicide squad attack on Arkham, which i found to be more entertaining,as the plot and the characters was well orchestrated, but i would have wanted the movie to stick with King Shark, rather than bring in Killer-croc. if they had made Killer-croc more menacing and imposing as in the animated movies, then i wouldn't have mind, but they made him look like a freak which barely resembled a crocodile. Will Smith played Deadshot really well. he had most if not all of the attention, along with Harley Quinn, Margot Robbie, and they brought in the charisma, while the rest of the characters, just filled in the blanks. JOKER was exceptionally played and he got that psychopathic crazy joker laugh right on money....would love to see him in a full length movie against his arch nemesis batman...Batman's fixation on Joker is only rivaled by Jokers fixation on Batman, they are the two face of a coin. Like the joker once said to Batman, ""Oh!!!Batsie you complete me"". Then again i had fun and i was entertained throughout the movie....that's all i ever wanted.",Suicide Squad
1391,moviefanphil,What a waste,6,1 January 2017,"The last decade has all been about Marvel. Now DC comics are coming into the limelight with a number of eagerly awaited titles in the pipeline. This movie had a number of interesting depthy characters and a story-line that kind of worked for me. Two individual performances were simply brilliant, Harley Quinn was sexy and crazy and believable and Jared Leto's performance as the Joker was an unexpected gem. But that's all the pluses for me! The special effects in this movie weren't all that special. Action scenes were cluttered and hard to follow and the whole thing just seemed a little rushed. In my opinion the producers have done one simple thing wrong that marvel worked out a long time ago. All of the characters both good and evil seem to have depth and an interesting backstory and could have likely had their own individual story told. And telling this first would have taken away the need for flash introductions and would have made the viewer understand and care for them.",Suicide Squad
1392,angwiles42,"Just the worst - writing, plot, everything",1,2 December 2017,"I am losing faith in the DC movie attempts. This is by far the worst of the lot, which just makes no sense. The cast was great, they had some of the best characters, and then did nothing with them. Most characters only got a few minutes to set up their backstory, so the character development was basically non-existent. Because of this, the characters were shallow, lacked reasoning for their motivations, and fell flat. One character was literally introduced, and quickly killed, simply to demonstrate the bombs planted in the villains. Such a cheap addition. The dialogue was stilted and awkward, and if I hear Will Smith say, ""We're the bad guys,"" one more time, I'm going to scream. The only character who I felt any sympathy with was El Diablo, and he barely did anything the entire movie. Jared Leto was also a terrible choice to play the Joker, but not as bad as Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, but that's another story. These actors were wasted. The entirety of the plot was such a giant mess. If Waller hadn't started the moronic plan to gather these villains, none of the events in the movie would have happened. For a character we are led to believe is so ruthless and smart, she's really a complete idiot. She's more a person who *thinks* she's smart than an actual smart person. I was so disappointed by this movie. There was such potential in the original idea, yet every step after that was taken down a horrible path. I will not be watching the sequel.",Suicide Squad
1393,milosx,I wanted to like it,4,4 August 2016,"Simply put it's disappointing. I went in with low expectations, and still couldn't wait for it to finish.Directing is all over the place, the story is just one cliché over another. I talking about ten guys slow-motion walking in the middle of the street with heavy rock soundtrack kind.Oh about soundtrack, the first part of the movie is just a music video. We meet the characters and while we do it we listen to a couple of 70's rock hits. Then after Black Sabbath's Paranoid comes Eminem with Shady's back. It's like dad/son made a greatest hits mix-tape. Acting is not bad overall, with Margot just being excellent, and Will also not bad at all. But the script is full of loopholes and the dialogues are simply boring that the cast had very little to work with. And thumbs down for the new Joker. He is a caricature, a gimmick, you can't really see him as a crime lord, let alone a dark twisted psychopath. Anyways, I'd like my money back, please. I can see how a 15yo might like it but these guys giving it ""10/10"", ""best movie of the year"", ""best pic eva!"" are just here on behalf of the studio.",Suicide Squad
1394,allovesmusicnvc,Personal review from someone that loves this kind of movies,8,5 August 2016,"I enjoy this movie as a big fan movies based on comics however you know that feeling that something was missing? So let's start with the good stuff: - Actors and performance - 10 and above; - Story - pretty awesome, 10 and above; - Costumes - pretty cool, 10 and above; - Timing - here where it got my points down. I felt like whenever there was a great scene, the one that you are supposed to laugh or pay close attention it was rushed. If they left a couple of seconds longer it would make a huge difference. - Humor - Again points down with the timing and I felt like it was supposed to be funny but it lacked audience connection to it. - Production in terms of props - pretty awesome, 10 and above; - Production in terms of camera shooting got points down because in some scenes they could have used the camera in other angles or shoot differently to make bigger and better impact. A few scenes to me were a little forced.The movie trailer sold be a pretty awesome movie and I was left with a great expectation but I left the movie thinking that I knew everything about it in the trailer and not from watching the full movie.",Suicide Squad
1395,mostafaosama,Good movie... Definitely not at Jared leto level of brilliance,7,10 August 2016,"the movie is good in many aspects. you would find it enjoyable if you had not expected much from this Squad. but for me i was waiting to see a director that could handle this type of movies. unfortunately i didn't find anything overwhelmingTHE COMEDY PART: it was a major disappointment, i really couldn't even smile. Margot Robbie IS NOT A COMEDIAN AT ALL. I don't know if it was the lines that are not that good or it was her that couldn't deliver it well. to sum up, the comedy lines were more than sick for me. THE ACTION PART: it was above average on the first half yet so superficially taken on the second half. it was normal for DC to deliver such performance on their movies, but for such marketing budgets you need to have a better view for action scenes.THE STORY PART: a very good story that could have much more intense but unfortunately it was not quiet phenomenal. i mean, DC always been able to deliver better comics than this. the introduction part for the characters was really good, actually hilarious. but as you go to the end it is going to be normal or less than normal.THE ACTING PART: i always had faith on Jared Leto sophisticated style on making his characters and this time was no exception. he delivered a world-class performance and created his own joker that i would love to see him in upcoming movies for DC. Jared was quiet phenomenal i would give him A+. Will Smith was good as always. he continued him good work on his latest movies and did a very handsome and good performance. Margot Robbie was never comedy and was abit cheesy at her scenes. i didn't love her in that movie at all, although i loved her so much at Wolf of Wall street which definitely showed her as a good actress but i couldn't find any reason to see her above those classic female actress of these days. she is good but not that good. the other performances were very good as well. which really implies that the director was not good for showing a well built movie to us.to sum it all up. it is not a failure for DC, yet not a hit. but we can say it is worth your time definitely because you would see a classic joker and will Smith doing good performance.",Suicide Squad

1397,syahir_iphone,Great movie with great cast,9,10 August 2016,"I''m not comparing DC or Marvel here, i'm just honestly reviewing from what i saw. First of all, i thought that the movie is sucks because most of the review and ""experts"" says it. But, i don't trust them until i watch the movie first. Luckily, i already watch the movie and it is not same with what the ""experts"" says. The movie is really great, its been a long time that i watch a movie that really great. From the first minute until the credits it gives you the adrenaline rush. The plot is easy to understand and the cast is really doing a brilliant job. Talking about casting, please do not compare ""RIP Heath Ledger"" joker and ""Jared"" joker. Both of the actor do their part magnificently. Seriously i feel the airtime for joker is not enough for me...hahah...i feel addicted every time the joker appear.

1398,echoes-31277,A disgrace to the whole DC universe.,1,22 November 2016,"If only I could give this movie a zero. Firstly I have read DC comics as a child and always looked for a movie like this. I believe even a child can't watch this without cringing. This movie has gained fame for only one reason. They used Margot Robbie's Harley character as bait to lure more people into watching this. Yeah. She is definitely pleasing on the eyes and I have seen people searching her everywhere including adult sites. So it is that simple now. Just put an attractive female and some background music and *boom* instant fame. All the joking aside , Harley's character was not supposed to be like that. If she were that attractive even the joker would love her. Instead in the comics , her character is portrayed as dark and psychotic. She is even more twisted than the joker. When you look at Margot Robbie she looks harmless as a fish. There is no evil in her face . The joker was not bad I must say but I only remember seeing him a few times just to realize he was in love with Margot Robbie. Oops. Well lets have it that way. I won't even talk about the rest. The whole movie is a cringe fest.",Suicide Squad
1399,anthony_mross,Just above Halle Berry's Catwoman,4,26 November 2017,"Seriously, I would have been so mad if I wasted money paying to see this film in the theaters. First off, Jared Leto's ""Joker"" is very, very pathetic. The look, demeanor, simply atrocious, and the attempt at Heath Ledger's ""Joker-talk"" was cringe worthy. I pray God has mercy on his soul.Will Smith and Margot Robbie actually do decent jobs with their characters, even though Robbie's ""Punk Harley"" suffered from being chained to Leto's Joker.Plot wise...world domination...the end. Seriously, the plan for a movie villain does not have to always be world domination. It is also tiring to see bright giant beams channeling another dimension, while at the same time, leveling the Earth, for the 1 Billionth time.This film did not feel connected in any way to the DCU, regardless of the fact Batman, Flash, Amanda Wheeler, and talks of Superman are featured. It was almost like ""just because you said it...does not make it true!""",Suicide Squad
1400,customerservice-51779,"Not recommended for cinema, just wait for Bluray or DVD",6,4 August 2016,"I hadn't expected much for Suicide Squad despite the trailer quite promising. As I finished watching this movie today, I can conclude that this movie just plain and simple. This is a movie that you watch on your plasma TV at home while studying, doing paperwork, or scrolling down your Facebook news feed and Instagram.This movie has so many awkward and dull moments. All of the casts actually delivered good performance, but they couldn't do much with story and script like this. Except for Cara Delevigne, I dare to say she's done a terrible, stupid acting. And about David Ayer, he actually is a talented director, but appointed him as a writer for Suicide Squad was a gravely mistake.Just go watch it at cinema, but maybe most of you will be disappointed.",Suicide Squad
1401,thetrinitydenied,DC successfully follows the unbeaten path Villains are finally given their time in the spotlight!,9,6 September 2016,"The DCEU continues their masterful trend to defy marvel's dominance by staying off their beaten, predictable path, in spite of critical reception. Finally, the villains get their proper respects after always playing second fiddle to the heroes. Not only does DC and David Ayer make them the headliner but with another great choice introduces the audience to peripheral villains not everyone is familiar with doing this in a way that breathes life, humanity and feeling into the type of characters that are generally only depicted as one-dimensional. It instantly expands the DC cinematic universe beyond anything Marvel is currently doing, and in the best way. Most often we are meant to despise the villains or align with the heroes' motivations, this turns that idea on its head challenging convention. It continues the dialogues that DC began in BvS; the questioning of government authority and manipulation (via Amanda Waller) as well as it's unabashed exploration of humanities darker side.The Squad's humanity is revealed and explored throughout the film and their ongoing mission. You don't expect to see yourself in the unhealthy romance of Harley and the Joker, Deadshot's desire to do right by his daughter, or Diablo's regret and reluctance to use his power, maybe even in Croc's outright 'disfigurement', but you DO. You want them to slip Wallers clutches and maybe get away or for Harley and Joker to end up in each other's arms. That's where this movie shines Smith, Robbie, Leto etc. The main characters are human, developed and believable. You end up understanding that criminals are not always villains simple, black and white, there isn't always an ultimate evil where you can point your finger, there are vast and varying shades of gray. True to his 40's gangster origins, Leto as Joker delivers an intense less is more approach in his great limited screen time (after all, it isn't a Joker movie). Along with the obvious sense that Harley is someone who is really important to him, you get a menacing, threatening, brooding Joker who always seems on edge of doing something violent and crazy if you push him, without being over the top or in your face at every given moment. He is a force of nature, and he doesn't need to be Ledger to be good.Believe it or not one of the over-all themes of this movie is family, where this group of conflicting and complimentary personalities finds a sense of camaraderie, belonging, and family within the dynamic of the team. Many of their individual motivations also involve family directly or indirectly from Katana and Flag to Joker and Harley again, who only really have each other. Given that the Squad is a big group some characters are more of a focal point, but not to its detriment. It is actually more encouragement to run with, and explore these and more villains in future installments with possible line-up changes.If you want to see the same old routine, then you probably won't like this. But if you have made your mistakes, have regrets, have had messed up love lives, aren't perfect, or just have a little darkness in You welcome home, DC is unafraid to explore this side of humanity within their villains as well as their heroes. Without all the flamboyant overly scripted Deadpool and Avengers style humor, these characters interact and speak in a natural way where it seems legitimate, where you're not reminded that a team of writers wrote every joke and each line is said with perfect delivery and timing. These aren't the Tony Stark's or the Steve Rogers' ideals to admire but that no one actually relates to. They are the those fallen from grace, the temptations, the imperfections, the ugly humanity, the redemption, the family and sense of belonging sought when you do not fit into societies mold. And they make you care about them. DC needs all the encouragement we can give to continue with their strong start and not submit to the pressures of trying to appease the masses, the cult classics are almost never appreciated by general audiences or critics when they are first released.In a world that is beginning to brim with comic based franchises the unbeaten path is the right one! DC is taking the reigns for the modern generations, challenging standards, and pushing the boundaries!",Suicide Squad

1403,vlogero,"The final DC movie I will ever pay to see, even if it was OK in the end.",2,11 August 2016,"With the release of Suicide Squad, I thought it would redeem DC and I'd really enjoy it. I was seriously going in with expectations around 8, and what I got was 6, and I'm highly considering a 5. How it could possibly be worse than Batman V Superman or one of my least favorite superhero films of all time, Man of Steel, is mind boggling. Maybe it's not as bad as Man of Steel, because there were parts and characters I did enjoy. I am about to list the actors/actresses from best to worst. Keep in mind, movies are art, and art is subjective.Will Smith (Deadshot): This is hands down, his best performance ever. This the only movie I actually talk about (with him in it) and refer to the character and not Smith himself. Deadshot was possibly the most well developed of the characters and as such, the most enjoyable.Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn): A better Joker than the Joker we got. Margot Robbie depicted an insane woman who fell in love with a possibly even more insane man. I would have put her over Will Smith in terms of acting, but her voice started to annoy towards the film, especially whenever she said ""pudding"". Overall, generally good.Viola Davis (Amanda Waller): The last ""good"" actress on the list (aside from the following mixed feelings one), Viola performed spectacularly in the film. I generally think she could be a military leader type thing. The only thing that kind of annoyed me was when she randomly shot people for no reason. I guess it pays to be sadistic.Cara Delevigne (Enchantress): OK, so I have mixed feelings about this one. As the Enchantress we saw in the original trailers, and as June Moone, she performed well. However when she turned into the Maleficent looking witch, and wasn't even in the Suicide Squad herself, really REALLY annoyed me. Great character, OK use.Jared Leto (Joker): Was he bad? No. Was he the best? Hell no. Jared Leto's Joker was OK, but the fact he was criminally-underused in the movie, and took up so much time in the trailers really ticked me off. If you want a great Joker, just go back and watch The Dark Knight, or play the first 2 Arkham games.Joel Kinnaman (Rick Flag): Decent. Enough said. Jay Hernadez (Diablo): Decent. Enough said.Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Killer Croc): Wasn't used enough and was one of the most pointless characters.Karen Fukuhara (Katana): Wasn't used enough and was one of the most pointless characters.Jai Courtney (Boomerang): The Australian accent annoyed me so much, I couldn't care less whether he died or not. Adam Beach (Slipknot): Was the number 1 most pointless character, who had like 4 lines and died right at the beginning. WHAT A WASTE.Aside from that, I have multiple other complaints. These include:Misuse of The Joker and Jared Leto's talent. Missing clips from the bloody trailer. The pointless characters. The horrible ending. Lack of dark tones. The film just randomly playing songs. Using the most famous promotional song in the credits. Slipknot. Making Enchantress the villain.Of course, the film did some good things to. Robbie, Smith and Davis did well, the effects were good, (even though it felt out of place) the songs were good, And some of the backstory scenes were pretty good.In the end, it's an OK film. Is it the worst movie of 2016? No. Is it the most disappointing? Hell yes. Should you go see it? If you likes MoS and BvS, then yes.",Suicide Squad
1404,hissiossi,"Not bad, but not good",6,18 August 2016,"After watching Suicide Squad I cracked the code of why DC movies are so hated against Marvel's. PLOT TWISTS!Suicide Squad was, in my opinion, a better movie than Batman vs. Sueprman, but with less interesting characters and an even more ridiculous ending. I liked the directing, the staging, the effects in the fight scenes (something I hated in BvS, looked so unreal) but everything else, I disliked.The characters were believable, but not entertaining. As a fan of comics and these stories I find it so stupid that these people, these people with such average skills who mostly fight with their fists or man made weapons (except for Diablo) go up against an ancient witch (basically a god) AND WIN! That's so stupid in my mind. Where were all those real superheroes when the 'terror attack' began?!But as I was saying.. DC movies totally lack proper plot twist. Suicide Squad is often compared to Batman vs. Superman and I did it too, throughout the whole movie and that's because they both lack proper plot twists! They are so straightforward and it's boring! Marvel at least brought out proper plot twists during the Civil War to keep things interesting, even during the end of the movie. These movies are just.. straight as an arrow. You know exactly what's gonna happen and how it's going to end.Final word on the Joker: I liked Leto's interpretation of him, hated his surroundings and makeup. I just stared at his teeth most of the movie thinking, ""That's so not the Joker.."". And seriously, night clubs? He seemed like a cliché east-European gangster with the bling bling and everything. Comparing him to Ledger is not fair, but at least Ledger somehow captured the Joker we all know. A wild card, insane. Leto's Joker just seemed way too slick and greasy!",Suicide Squad
1405,marcchoover-56977,"Starts off great, good middle, then drops off at the end.",7,9 August 2016,"I do have to say DC is getting better at their movies. Maybe they are taking hints from Marvel, I don't know, but I do know is that this movie was a good movie. The beginning was a solid 9/10. Middle of the movie was a 8/10, then end was a 6/10. If it had a good ending, it would've been a AWESOME movie. But they screwed the ending up. So anticlimactic. You could pretty much predict what was going to happen, even though there was a million different things happening, and at the same time, confused about what is going on.And to the person that is suing because they didn't put enough Joker in the movie - I thought there was plenty of Joker scenes. Add anymore and the whole movie is about the Joker. They ended the movie setting it up for Wonder Woman/The Flash/Suicide Squad 2.",Suicide Squad

After watching this film on TV, I did not regret not going cinemas for this. The main problem with the film was that it was 95% long, boring talk which was ridiculously stuffy and hammy. And with that, only a few minutes of action scenes. The second worst part of the film was when the crazy witch appeared and this is where pretty much everything else went wrong.

But there are some problems with the plot, and I will show you right now.Positive: 1/Acting: The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Jai Courtney,... all did a great job portraying their characters. The movie could have been worse without them.2/Fun: Yes, SS was so hilarious! I just couldn't stop laughing. Harley Quinn was the funniest.Every time she showed up I LOL. DC should keep making funny movies like this one.3/Action: The battle scenes were way better than those of BvS. The whole team was bad-ass!Negative: 1/Plot: David Ayer was the wrong choice for this film. His plot felt a little rushed and there were many plot holes. For ex, why didn't Enchantress started her plans long ago. Cause she must have known that the Suicide Squad could stop her, right? Or why didn't super heroes do anything when the whole world goes chaotic? In Batman: Assault on Arkham, Batman showed up to stop SS, so why didn't he show up in this movie???2/Joker The trailers made Joker look very promising, but Jared Ledto didn't live up to the heights. Heath Ledger is still the best, I guessed.3/Enchantress Just one word: Shazam!That's all for my review, hope you found it useful and if you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say it.",Suicide Squad
1408,AmonStarrick,Suicide Squad is a joke ... but not a funny one,2,29 August 2016,"I had no expectations for this film , but I was still disappointed.The Story: Amanda Waller, who works for the government, compiles the ""Task Force X"" aka the Suicide Squad, to fight against supernatural enemies like a new evil Superman. The most important members of the squad get a little scene, which introduces them. One of them is Enchantress, a half woman-half witch. She is in love with the leader of the Suicide Squad Rick Flag. On a mission Enchantress escapes and revives her ancient brother and both strive to destroy the whole world together. Now the Suicide Squad has to stop them. Beside this main story the Joker wants to get his girlfriend Harley Quinn back, who is a member of the so called Task Force X.The Characters:Rick Flag is a stereotype Soldier, who just excists to include a lame lovestory in the film.Boring character Amanda Waller is ridiculous. She seems to be a really evil woman, but in fact she is just an unreasonable pseud.Harley Quinn is created to be funny and cool and awesome and she is none of that. She is just super annoying. Expected so much more from the trailers and I don't get the hype around her. A good costume doesn't make a good character by itself.Deadshot is the main character ... I guess and he is definitely the coolest and most sympathatic character in this movie. He has some funny and cool scenes, but even Will Smith can't save the ridiculous story.The Joker is not that bad, I mean he is different to every Joker performance before, but it does feel a little weird and over the top. He is an insane psychopath, who seemingly enjoys to ... be evil. Honestly it's really cringy, but whatever. The Character is not important for the main plot, so it doesn't hurt that much.Enchantress is the worst and most ridiculous villain I've seen in my life. When she whispers ""Enchantress"" she turns into a witch and this is unbearably cringy. If you wanna have a menacing villain watch Suicide Squad to see how you don't do it.Captain Boomerang: I don't like Jai Courtney that much, but this role was OK... Yes the character is absolutely useless, but at least he wasn't annoying like most of the assembly.El Diablo was OK until he transformed into the firedevil ... or whatever that was. Also he got a background story everyone saw 1000-times before and is just not compelling or thrilling.Killercroc was visually OK, but completely useless for the plot and serves no purpose at all.""Katana"" gets thrown into this story for no reason and she stays completely bland and boring the whole movie.My opinion: The film tries hard to be epic, funny, awesome and cool, but he isn't all this at all. The story is going in a circle, cause it ends where it starts with no development at all. The reason why the villain is created is the creation of the Squad. If Amanda Waller didn't create the Task Force X, Enchantress would never have escaped. So basically because of the creation of the squad, the squad is necissary.Also I'm just tired of seeing villains create a flickering, lightningthrowing, giant ""EverythingDestroyingAndKillingMachine"".The first Trailer was actually cool and I was kinda looking forward to this movie then the second came out and it was a bit eehh and already filled with unfunny jokes. That ""dehyped"" me completely and then I watched the movie in the theatres. I can say it was the worst experience I ever had in the cinema. I will never watch this mess again.",Suicide Squad

Also some pieces of rather cringy dialogue with a less than stellar villain and her throwaway brother. That was It, I enjoyed everything else, If you're looking for a good harley quinn, deadshot, killer croc e.t.c, It's all here. If you want to see a grounded, life changing, emotional experience of a movie, what the hell are you doing coming to a movie called Suicide Squad, geez. Not to sound defencive but I feel the critics are hard on this movie because they don't get it and they don't understand it, because it really wasn't made for them. Now a movie should try to appeal to everyone but the critics are giving it crap because they're focusing too much on the downfalls that I mentioned before, I mean go see the film, make up your own mind. In my opinion, Its got some hiccups but also some real strong points which makes this a damn of an entertaining movie. If you've ever seen the movie Commando, you'll know both movies don't care what a film should be and focus all their energy on entertaining the audience. Shouldn't that be enough",Suicide Squad
1410,katgameplayer,Possibly. Worst DC Movie. EVER!,2,27 August 2016,"(SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE FILM ARE AHEAD.) Alright. I'm going to spoil EVERYTHING that happens in this movie. You've been warned. This movie is TERRIBLE!!! First up, the plot makes absolutely ZERO sense because the trailer guys came in to RE-EDIT the entire film, and because of that there are many, MANY, continuity errors. Next, the visuals are the same story: Choppy, poorly edited, etc, etc. The characters are GARBAGE. The only people who try in this ENTIRE film are: Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and a little bit of Jay Courtney. That's IT. Viola Davis is meh, Killer Crock (sorry for wrong spelling) is BAD, Jared Leto is trying WAY TOO HARD to out do Heath Ledger, and more. And if you expected the Suicide Squad to take on the Joker, you ain't getting it! No, the ACTUAL villain is Cara Delevingne's Enchantress. Bad. Just bad. During the battle, all she does is wiggle dance in front of a giant cliché weapon, and create cliché minions. And when the movie ends, there is a mid-credits scene involving Viola Davis talking to Ben Affleck which makes no sense. Overall, I give Suicide Squad: 2.1/10.",Suicide Squad
1411,usersx,"Short, honest opinion. not a fanboy.",10,8 August 2016,"This movie really isn't bad. Blockbuster attributes check, fun check, action check, pretty lady check, bad bi@tch check, some life changing quotes check and too emotional plot check. What you people don't like so much about it? I don't say its the best movie I've ever seen, but its worth your time and money. It ain't that marvel type comic adaptation, but in its own right deliveres some fun and action, plus MRs bum, smiths try-to-be-fun comments. Croco is good, boomerang looks really crazy with his little pony. Honestly 7/10, but for all those haters out there who don't enjoy, just talk sh@t about everything 10/10. Aloha",Suicide Squad
1412,mk_films_001,Go see this movie!,7,4 August 2016,"DC brings some of the best villains ever to the big screen. Will Smith and Margot Robbie bring their characters to life! Not to mention Jared Leto is incredible as the Joker. There are some pacing issues, and it doesn't flow super well. But the overall result is a great movie: it's funny, it's action, it's emotional. And some of the most lovable villains there are. We've been wrapped up in comfortable Marvel land for way too long. DC is finally bringing us some super-hero/villain movies with some real meat. I'm impressed that DC has been able to throw all these incredible characters at us this quickly...and I can't wait to see them expand on the universe.",Suicide Squad

1414,madmongolian,Could've been WAY better.,2,16 October 2016,"This movie was just such a disappointment to me. I don't expect every movie to be perfect, but I do at the least want a movie that isn't expecting me to focus on more that three things at once at the BEGINNING. Are we supposed to focus more on the squads problems in prison, or focus on what the villain is planning. It would be less of a problem if they had multiple scenarios happening at once in the middle of the movie so they have enough time to explain what's happening, instead of shoving it all in the beginning. That's enough of that problem, oh but don't worry, there are TONS of flaws in this movie. Another problem is the Joker's design, IT'S HIDEOUS. Why do they give him such a bad hair style? Why is his eye makeup so THIN, and why is his lipstick not spread out to his cheeks like they are in the heath ledger movie? He's just so ugly looking. Another FATAL problem at the end is when Diablo dies, NO ONE acknowledges it, you can't have someone sacrifice themselves and then have no one acknowledge that, that just makes it REALLY painfully unneeded. One last flaw I need to mention is that the villain who's called The Witch is just not a good villain. Ascetically she looks fine, but her dialogue is just plain BAD. At the end of the movie I just felt disappointed. What saves this movie from being worse is how wonderfully entertaining the Suicide Squad themselves were, particularly Harley Quinn. She was my favorite character. However it just wasn't enough. Entertaining characters mixed with cringe worthy dialogue doesn't equal a good movie.",Suicide Squad
1415,arjaygalona,Fun though a little bit cartoonish,6,8 August 2016,"Likes: Margot Robbie – this film is Margot Robbie's movie. I'm saying this not because I love her but because her character portrayal stood out from the rest. She is the humor of the film and literally the craziest character and the loveliest at the same time.Camera Works – David Ayer sure knows how to take beautiful shots. I'm a little bit partial to the movie's cinematography but the shots were great.Plot – I'm not a big fan of the ""questionable"" plot with no real motivation from most of its characters but I took it as it is. It's plain and simple. No complications and not hard to understand.Viola Davis – you will hate her but you will love her at the same time that you might find yourself rooting for her over the ""bad guys"" and then you'll hate her again. That's how good she is.Dislikes: Execution – this could've been executed better. Yes, David Ayer took beautiful shots but his direction is not cohesive. Flashback scenes are needed but they tend to be anti-climactic. There are also scenes that for me are a little bit unfocused to what should be really going on. There are also several scenes that I find a little bit cartoon-ish.Central Character – I believe that Deadshot should really be the lead but Will Smith's portrayal is a little bit out there. His characterization is kind of corny. I can say easily that Harley Quinn stole every scene she's in.Cara Delevingne – I love her as a top model but she's still too ""young"" to be a full-pledge actress. Blank eyes and unbelievable emotions made me cringe a bit. But she's getting there, I hope.Jared Leto – yes, he's not Heath Ledger but I can't help comparing them together. Both are Oscar winners but unfortunately, Jared can't pull off Joker (yet). I believe that he's a method actor but it didn't work in this movie. I can still see Jared Leto acting unlike Heath who lost into the character itself. For me, that's the difference – one is acting as Joker while the other IS Joker.Over All Impression: Well, I have to say that apart from the poor execution and direction of the movie and contrary to some (or most) of the critics Suicide Squad is good. Good thing they did re-shoots to bring in more humor in the film after BvS was heavily criticized for being boringly serious and laughable in a bad way. DC made the right move to ""copy"" Marvel movies though they might have overdone the humor in some parts.Suicide Squad is a psychedelic mixture of quirky (though some are forgettable) characters that surprisingly worked well for the total cinematic experience. It's a good introduction to a franchise with great potential. I would surely love to see a Suicide Squad vs Justice League movie in the future.",Suicide Squad
1416,menghuikrista,"Well, the movie isn't as bad as what some critics make it out to be....",5,10 August 2016,"I am not saying that the movie was a masterpiece or anything. If anything, it was a mindless popcorn thriller with barely any character development and just thrills all the way.I have to say that the movie really should have given moments for each and every one of the cast to shine. But, they didn't. The focus is all on Harley Quinn( I am not saying that Margot Robbie was bad or anything in her role) and characters like Katanna and Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang barely have any lines in this movie.And, don't even get me started on the horrible mess of its plot. Enchantress was a terrible villain and her motivation for trying to conquer the world is hardly ever explained. And we have to admit that she was a pretty crappy villain. She spent most of her screen time trying to build some crappy machine while she let her brother do all of the work.But, those things aside, the first twenty minutes of the movie where they introduce the characters are stylish and cool. It might have been exposition-heavy, but it sure was fun to watch. And I was always somewhat entertained throughout the whole movie. Though, without Margot Robbie's performance, I would probably give this movie a 4 and a half stars. She definitely nailed the role. And she was one of the highlights of the movie.Overall, it is a mediocre film.",Suicide Squad
1417,countryrabbit,Lots of Fun,9,5 August 2016,"If you like real life movies or Shakespeare or other stuff that bores me to rears you will hate this movie. If you are a film critic that likes movies that are duller than dog dodo you will hate this movie. If you have a sense of humor and like to have fun you will love this movie. This is a great summer block buster and by far the best movie of the summer, that I have seen at least. Most movies disappointed me this year but not Suicide Squad, it was a blast. The CGI was great, there was plenty of comic relief, and I found the film slowed down in spots just enough to catch my breath, then went right back to action. I liked the way Will Smith is toned down, so other actors could shine. I really miss Heath Ledger as the joker, Jared Leto did a good job but was not in the same league as Ledger.",Suicide Squad
1418,theshareminator,Margot Robbie is worth a star,1,7 November 2020,"If you thought Batman vs Superman was bad, then you'll need to brace yourself for this terrible mess!Slow motion gun tossing and painfully boring action scenes tacked onto an excessive amount of walking on screen.Margot Robbie deserves a star for that outfit. Her character wasn't nearly as nutty as it should have been though.",Suicide Squad
1419,zodyoh,a year of waiting well worth,10,7 August 2016,How does one sum up this movie well you just cant. This movie has been on my mind since I first found out a year ago and I have been waiting non stop and here we are. Lets talk Amanda Waller yes viola Davis was exceptionally amazing and a great choice on creating a tact force team of the baddest of the bad and they delivered just that. First up the infamous Lloyd Lawton aka dead-shot an assassin who never misses and he was exceptionally fanatic on keeping what he values on mind. Will smith was not bad at all he even gave a side to dead-shot that was perfect. Harley Quinn was just tasteful she was perfect among words and she gave the character perfection amongst all things. Jared Letos joker was interesting to say at most he gave the joker a whole new side and yet kept it insanely perfect. The rest of the cast was among perfect from Diablo to killer croc and the boomerang gave the characters something to love. this movie was amongst perfect in many ways the movie took the baddest of the bad and made a hell of a team and I have to admit the trailers gave this movie perfect justice. Shockingly to say the reveal of the main villain was not what I expected and how the movie plays out was just grand it was truly worth the wait and would see it again.,Suicide Squad
1420,iwanmaidin,Great movie to introduce justice league,8,7 August 2016,"I personally think that Suicide squad is a great movie to introduce justice league. The presence of flash and batman helps the viewer to understand justice league plot and explain what really happen when they lost superman in batman vs superman saga. Will smith's role is quite astonishing and I consider his role as alive. Amanda walker is so mean. Captain boomerang is a little bit wooden. The quality of the humors was fantastic. I enjoyed them so much. I think SC should have notable villain (bad guy) character. Personally I think Enchantress shouldn't be the villain. She didn't really portray the ""bad side"" of the movie. The main reason why Enchantress turns against Amanda is because she threatens her. She is not the bad side, Amanda is. It will be cool if Joker be the villain instead (lol). I love the new joker. Simplicity and elegant combined. He is totally will be the bad ass during the next DC movie. Can't wait to watch him. The flashbacks to introduce all the character were great. Simple and straight to the point. SC is able to show the good side of Harley despite she is totally the bad villain. Joker's helicopter accident was a great plot twist. In terms of general plot, I still didn't see the connection between SC and dark knight rises and the previous DC movies. I hope the next DC movie can provide the viewers with the connections",Suicide Squad
1421,craigfs-17680,chaotic fun,8,10 August 2016,"I have gotten into the habit lately (maybe rightly or not) of walking into movies with pretty low expectations (see Tarzan review) however both times this has happened I have had a great viewing experience.I get the feeling,although not easily swayed that the negativity that many big releases are getting these days pre release is so overwhelming that it becomes hard to focus solely on the movie itself.Bottom line is that the haters may have written off Suicide Squad already and on some points maybe they are right to but having seen it 2D without gimmicks and so on it is well directed and pretty well acted for the most part.The characters are darkly fun and I love the villain twist.I never got bored and loved the Joker (hope he returns) and for 2 hours or so had a really great time watching a popcorn flick which entertains.IMO it delivers the blockbuster side of the deal,but on the flip side the negatives are,sloppily set up,no real tension on building the team,first 45 minutes pretty crude and messy with no real narrative which has any cohesion and ""emotional"" scenes when they occur feel slightly shoe-horned in and not massively convincing.Best performances.Margot Robbie,Jared Leto,Viola Davis as Amanda Waller and Jai Courtney who knows about handling a boomerang.",Suicide Squad
1422,Michael_Haring01,Your average viewer,7,7 August 2016,"Overall I found this movie to be pretty good. Despite reviews from critics and fanboys who are expecting movies to be exactly like their dusty old comic books and totally demolishing this movie, I actually found it to be alright. Knowing nothing about the suicide squad going in and being somewhat disappointed by the last few DC movies (especially in the case of Batman vs. Superman) I overall thought the movie did a decent job of introducing dynamic characters. I thought Will Smith's character ""Deadshot"" was very well played as well as Margot Robbie's ""Harley Quinn"". On the flip side there was some very poor, forced, almost unbearable acting moments such as the character ""Killer Croc"" being almost like another dumb ""The Thing"" from the fantastic four. What I think was the worst miss of this movie was the main antagonist, this cheesy villain was a very poor choice for this movie as well as some of the CGI that was needed for it. I think in a different setting with a different villain this movie does a lot better. As your average super hero movie viewing critic who's going into the theater expecting such, I would say overall despite some misses I found this movie to be pretty enjoyable and would definitely not let some overly critical fanboys deter you from seeing this movie.",Suicide Squad
1423,wynnlee,This movie is fun and better than average but fail to deliver the teamwork of suicide squad,5,3 August 2016,"First of all, i have knowledge on DC comic characters. I know what those villains(i mean suicide squad) can do. However this movie just does not show much. Basically, u're just watching those villains joining together in a squad trying to get job done.(working together? ... not really).It does not introduce all of the characters well, this movie only show the surface of them(their power) and not much personality.I believe most of the people want to see .... ""teamwork"" , the bond between the squad members. You wont see how they understand each other well(Where is the conflict since they all have different personality), they just all become friends or partners since they join the squad， except the boss who they hated of course.This movie also does not show how they work together with their abilities during the fight. For example, Deadshot shooting alone , Harley fighting alone , Killer Croc punching alone, soldier shooting. This does have action scene but we cant see the villains teamwork performance especially fighting together. It's like you wont feel anything important on those characters.Batman: Assault on Arkham， this animated film actually did an awesome work on those villains. And i must say this animated film is better than this movie if u want to know what is the real suicide squad can do.OK Story， The story is straight forward and not much depth, it does have some twist but not so much influence on the main story. The Bad Guy in this movie is also ""straight forward"". Even the relationship between squad members are .... ""straight forward"", so this might be the reason some people don't like this movie. But it is still fun if you enjoy the movie.Actors performance， i will say good on most of the cast. you will not disappointed. And Jokers in this movie does not shine because the limit of his scene time(don't expect too much from Joker).Soundtrack is awesomeThis movie can be better,it may disappointed on people who have high expectation. For me, i want the suicide squad (villains working together） to shine, but sadly i didn't see that. It's like an adventure with the suicide squad, u will enjoy it. But if u want to understand the squad or feel the importance of them, then i might say no. Not sure if PG-13 limit the potential of this movie, but i guess it can be more epic if it's 18.There is a mid credit scene, so wait a while before u leave.",Suicide Squad
1424,yozanirwan,Finally we get what we want,7,3 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is one of the best DCEU movie. It contains a lot of humor that work well in this kinda universe. The characters have so much chemistry, especially between Harley Quinn and Joker although they didn't make much of interaction. Chemistry between Rick Flag and Deadshot is interesting too. But the Characters that surprised me the most is Captain Boomerang and El Diablo. Captain Boomerang character get the best joke in my opinion in this movie. El Diablo character has a back story again in opinion the best. This movie got a really good story, maybe at certain parts is kinda confusing but in the end it solved really well. The week part of this movie is Killer Croc character. He is underused in this movie. It's just like he is there but not very important. Overall this movie is really awesome not to mention the soundtracks it's just perfect.",Suicide Squad
1425,rrd-45959,GREAT Movie! The critics are being ridiculous.,10,4 August 2016,"The critical response to this is absolute NONSENSE. I genuinely thought Batman v Superman deserved it's low rating, but this movie DOES NOT. I went into this movie TRYING to be hard on this movie. At the end, I realized I could only nitpick a few things.NONSPOILER REVIEW: Screw the critics. This movie is fantastic. GO SEE IT!!SPOILER REVIEW:The movie had an EXTREMELY basic plot line, which some critics can't seem to follow. The movie begins with the main characters being introduced as Waller flips through the briefing notebook. Then the main villain is introduced and explained. The main villain gets out. The squad is released to deal with villain. Main conflict. Resolution. End. How does it get more basic than that? Margot Robbie was the PERFECT Harley Quinn. She really nailed it. Deadshot, though a bit different from the comics, was really great in this movie. El Diablo was also another very pleasantly surprising character that I enjoyed. Enchantress and her brother as the main villains worked rather well and were very creepy. Going into this movie not really reading the comics, but knowing extensive background knowledge, I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. My only critiques: 1) Killer Croc was written poorly. His character was kind of cheesy, hard to understand, and stereotypical. 2) A lot of scenes in the trailer were cut; however, I would rather they cut scenes that didn't fit vs. try to jam them in there like in BvS. This is only my critique because I was looking forward to seeing them. What was released was still great.Overall: I would give this movie a 9-9.5/10. I really enjoyed the movie from beginning to end. There were no parts I thought dragged on. They wasted no time. Loved it! PS. Screw the simple minded critics.",Suicide Squad
1426,abrilbenitezgnr,Disappointing,3,13 August 2016,"I waited approximately 8 months from last December to this day , I saw the movie. The first 20 minutes I thought "" this is going to be great,"" but the following 102 minutes I felt lost , I felt embarrassed to see many scenes, and finally I was deeply disappointed .No depth , no plot, no logic or history . A partial waste of time and money. Jared Leto, the joker, he most wanted character only appears three times, yes, three miserable times. Half of the film I did not understand what was going on because there was no logic in nothing, and the final battle with the witch (I don't know where she comes from, where he gets his power) was so illogical, so stupid, and so ""wtf"". Totally disappointing. I would not pay to see it again and I will not pay to see the sequel.",Suicide Squad
1427,martinjyrenaud,"Jared Leto plays awful Joker, awful jokes, Marvel copycat movie",5,19 August 2016,"*** Spoilers ***Will Smith probably saved the movie from total failure. Harley Quinn was annoying and I don't understand what the hype was all about with her character (besides the actress).1.5 hours into the movie and we only saw the Joker a few times. The first appearance was more sexual than scary when he started touching Griggs. Very weird compared to what you'd expect from the Joker.Last battle scene vs the witch's brother They discussed a battle plan before attacking the witch's brother and determined that a super bomb will take out this magical being. This being said, someone still tried to throw a knife at the witch's brother and then Harley goes after the witch's brother with a baseball bat. It's kind of ridiculous. There were none of the witch's foot soldiers to protect them (odd) and her spell was completed the second after her brother died ; talk about impeccable timing.Last battle vs the witch: After the witch decides to stay and fight while her spell is consuming the world, Harley decides to hit the witch with a baseball bat, yes a baseball bat, and says ""Oh, sorry"". The witch then shoves her away instead of killing her with the dual katana. Horrible, just horrible. They even knew that the only way to destroy the witch is to cut her heart out so I'm not sure what a baseball bat would do and I would not call a baseball bat a distraction vs a witch but this movie does. Then the witch says ""Enough"" and in 1 second takes all of their weapons away and then tells them to bow to her or die. Harley then pretends to bow and then grabs a katana and cuts out the witch's heart. The end.I also don't understand why Jared Leto went into method acting for only a few sentences in the movie.Terrible movie and nothing new. There is an after a scene after the credits of an Avengers wanna-be movie apparently led by Batman.",Suicide Squad
1428,gracehuo,"Good movie, too harshly criticised",8,12 August 2016,"I think it's a good movie overall, I enjoyed it and could really relate to the characters, I get why it was criticised so much, and I am really disappointed at WB for deleting all the scenes. I get that it's a PG 13 movie, so they had to delete the abusive scenes so that they don't ""glorify"" the abusive relationship between HQ and Joker. But if you really don't want to mislead children and teenagers why do you glorify the villains? The whole movie is focused on villains and how cool they are, how is that not misleading? I want them to make an actual movie, follow the original storyline, actually put some real elements into it instead of just trying to make it appropriate, I think it's worth to make it R rated, although it might be risky for the box office... can't be worse than it already is right? Look at how much the box office has dropped and how much it is being criticised. DC was doing a good job until WB stepped in. I'm disappointed for that but then again overall, I still liked it as I really could relate to the characters. Hope to see more of Joker and Harley Quinn. Without Harley Quinn this movie would've had no point. I like that it is focused on the villains, but as I said, if that's what they wanted just go all the way! Don't cut the abusive scenes, that's just who they are and now the plot line is confusing and sends mixed messages.",Suicide Squad

The characters are very interesting and at the start of the movie you get a brief summary of them all. The plot is very good but the idea of the movie is great. The movie industry hasn't been at it's best with movie ideas running out and everything becoming repetitive so it's nice to have everything mixed up and changed. I would've liked to of seen some other DC villains here like The Riddler or Mr Freeze but the choice of villains were great. This is a brilliantly made movie and I do not really know what most of the hate towards it is about.",Suicide Squad
1430,trentonlaz,Mediocre,5,28 September 2016,"Suicide Squad did not live up to expectations. The idea of a team of awesome supervillians never seen before in the movies was very exciting. Unfortunately there were too many new supervillians, and not enough time. The story behind the characters was little to nothing. Will Smith's character Deadeye was an awesome hired assassin who couldn't miss. His character could have made a movie of its own along with any other of these characters. The backstory for him felt rushed. Captain Boomerang had one scene for backstory where he robs a bank. That's it. For them to introduce a new character and to show little backstory for them did not allow me to fall in love or root for them. Katana seemed like a real bad*** but I just couldn't learn enough about her. The joker and Harley Quinn scenes seemed liked they were part of a completely different movie. A movie about the backstory between these two new character which I would have much rather seen to be honest. The new Joker got everyone's hopes up since the phenomenal performance of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight left many wondering what they could do next. I personally thought David Leto did a fantastic job with the new joker but he was showed only a handful of times. Not to mention the scene where he ""died"" which left me with no surprise that he turned up alive at the end. At points in the movie I actually ended up rooting AGAINST some of the main protagonists. Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis left me wondering if i should root for or against her. She tortured the witch she held under her control by stabbing her heart, and then obviously the witch is angered and is freed. Amanda Waller later shoots the people working for her so that nobody else would see what was going on. She shot all of those innocent people working for her. The ending seemed very bad even for this mediocre film. Amanda Waller puts all of the Suicide Squad back into prison with half of their sentence. They all have more than a life sentence and this means nothing to them. She puts the people that saved the whole world back into prison. Maybe they wouldn't be able to survive outside of prison as they would just get into more trouble but I wouldn't know that because I don't know anything about them. Too many things were left out from every character's story line that I felt they either needed more movie time, or less characters to actually make this movie work. This movie felt really rushed. Suicide Squad was very predictable and never for a moment did I think, ""maybe they won't win."" The final fight was small and most of the time I was thinking, ""how"" or ""why."" The fight of the two witches that could do anything, against a bunch of normal people with cool abilities and a fire guy, who's lines were extremely cheesy and cringe worthy, was predictable. The climax was everything short of a climax. A good climax should leave me on my seat wondering what will happen next but suicide squad left me wondering how much longer till they win. I know the good guys always win but this seemed to just be unoriginal in their attempt to change what made Suicide Squad different from other superhero movies. Suicide Squad had a lot of good things going for it with an awesome cast, and cool new characters and ideas to bring to the table. With all of this going for it, I still give it a 5 out of 10 for what felt like a summary of what a bigger and better movie Suicide Squad could have been.",Suicide Squad

1432,JoshIrpacido,Harley Quinn. Nice to Meet Ya.,3,12 October 2016,"Hey, DC Fanboys. These knock-off Marvel movies are awful. Not only was Batman v. Superman abysmal and polarizing, but Suicide Squad was just atrocious. About a year ago, I was probably one of the few people on Earth to actually think that BvS was going to suck. I thought it was going to be a dumb action movie that was made just so Batman and Superman could fight for illogical reasons. I was half-right. Around the same time, my brother and I saw Batman: Assault on Arkham. It was good. The characters were really likable and we were very interested in the plot, it was also the first piece of media to prove to me that Harley Quinn is hot. I was waiting for Suicide Squad to come out, except for two reasons. Those reasons were; Deadshot was going to be played by Will Smith, and it incorporated elements from the New 52. I like Will Smith, but it bothers me to see a character being played by a race that isn't their own. I like Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, but it bothered me knowing that the Natives probably weren't real natives. Then came along BvS, which made me want to stay the f*** away from anymore DC movies. I was right. What's the plot? No really, what's the plot? The movie lost me midway through. I'm too lazy to actually read the Wikipedia page, so let's just say this. This movie is boring. How did they manage to make the Suicide Squad unwatchable. With the exception of Margot Robbie and Jared Leto, none of the characters are noteworthy. Not even Will Smith, who is usually the better part of any movie, was interesting in this flick. I can't even remember what anyone, or anything did in this movie. In a callback to the comics, Slipknot appears and gets his head blown off. This did not leave as much of an impact as KG Beast's death in BAoA. The cinematography is for sh**. Why is it so dark? You could actually see Batman v. Superman, but not the otherwise average action scenes. The acting is good, except for Rick Flag. The only reason I even say that, is because these people are professional actors who've done better things. What the f*** is this, DC. It just keeps getting worse. I went to go see Man of Steel in the theaters, but I don't remember a god d*** thing. I could still say that it was passable. We didn't finish BvS, but there was some enjoyment in actually watching it. This piece of trash doesn't even have the common decency to exploit Harley Quinn like a lot of us wanted. The posters look cool, this does not. I gives this a 3/10. It's is not enjoyable, but it still reaches above the usual trash at 2/10. It is however, the second attempt for DC to redeem themselves, and they're doing a pretty sh** job at it. Don't go see Wonder Woman next year. Instead, watch Wonder Woman (2009) at home. This is only slightly better than something like Spooky Buddies. That's a direct-to-video Disney flick. It's a general rule for those to suck hot garbage. Why did we even waste our time?",Suicide Squad
1433,tothearkham,Worst DCEU film yet,3,6 January 2017,"I had really high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailers. I thought it would a funny, dark comedy kind of superhero movie with lots of awesome action, and a new rendition of the Joker that could live up to the standards of previous ones. Boy was I wrong...Let's start with the editing. It's godawful and makes everything in the movie hard to follow. The movie just randomly moves between scenes with no real transitions or setup. The effects are also pretty terrible. The Ancient God Whatevers look like they belong in an Asylum film. Not in a movie with a budget of 175 million dollars. And Killer Croc looks like the lovechild of Jaws and George Costanza with a bad case of greyscale.The acting in this film is okay. Margot Robbie does a good Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney isn't terrible for once and is actually funny at times, and Will Smith is Will Smith cosplaying as Deadshot. Everyone else is either forgettable or has really terrible lines. Like Rick Flagg, who is just there to give shitty exposition so the movie can just add random fan service characters without worrying about actually having to show their personality and traits.But the worst part of this film is the Joker. With any Joker incarnation, he should be able to make the audience laugh and be scared by his performance. Jared Leto's version tries way to hard to be both and fails miserably. When he tries to be funny and over the top, he just comes off as extremely cringy, and when he tries to be scary, he just seems like like an edgy tryhard. His acting as Joker isn't helped by his terrible design. I mean come on, those stupid tattoos are basically exposition on his character because Rick Flagg isn't there to explain him. The film also absolutely butchered Harley Quinn and Joker's relationship. Suicide Squad made it seem like the Joker actually loved Harley. Their relationship was always meant to be an abusive one where Harley has deluded herself into thinking the Joker loves her, when in reality, the Joker is just using her. This leads to the Joker coming off as more of a lovesick puppy instead of a manipulative criminal mastermind. And if a film can't even get its most hyped characters right, it isn't worth wasting your time watching.",Suicide Squad
1434,mrtastyduck,Complete Trash Movie,1,29 December 2016,"If you want to read the basic sum up of how I, a general movie-goer who goes to see a good movie and not validate my blind obsession with a group of DC characters (which I feel is why this movie gets its massive levels of undeserved praise), feel about this film then here it is: Suicide Squad is terrible movie whose existence can be summed up as a blatant excuse to overproduce and market edgy merchandise. The film feels like a soulless product.Let's start with the plot. The government gathers and blackmails a group of villains to fight against a supernatural ghost/witch who is going to destroy the world. That's pretty much it. Any friends of mine who liked the movie and have tried to attribute some deeper meaning to this shallow plot can't really do so without reference to some material outside the movie (such as comic books). That is pathetic. The movie should stand on its own but it simply doesn't.The terrible plot could be forgiven if the characters were in any way well presented. However, this is not the case. The characters are lazily introduced in the first 30 minutes of the film in short flashback/montage sequences. You are given no reason to care unless you're already a fan who is familiar with the characters. OK, so the plot is terrible and paced in the worst way possible but, maybe the acting redeems the script to an extent. Nope. The acting is not good and I don't even know if it's really the fault of the actors since I know Jared Leto, Will Smith and Margot Robbie are great actors. This movie, however, demonstrates how even good actors (be it because of a bad script or poor direction) can give absolutely terrible performances. None of the characters feel like villains. We're just told about the characters in the lazy intro sequences or by other characters (*cough* Katana *cough cough*) but never shown their characters. It's incredibly forced. The Harley Quinn and Joker performances are just on-the-nose and cringe-worthy. Joker is a blatant example of an actor thinking that acting weird and edgy equates to acting insane and Harley Quinn is just eye-candy crossed with awful punchline dispenser (none of which are funny and just sound like they were written to be printed on cheap merchandise).Again, I don't even feel that I can blame this on the actors entirely since the film is also edited poorly. The first half feels like a bloated sequence of trailers with really distracting music choices, and the second half just feels like one long action scene that blurs into one long mess of characters smashing pathetic enemies before reaching the big climactic fight sequence. It's especially awful that it seems like the editors chose the most cringe parts of Jared Leto's Joker performance that just equate to him acting like a cosplayer who thinks playing Joker can be done by acting eccentric and over-the-top. AKA the most amateur style of acting/worst pick of shots possible. Allow me to speculate as to what this movie was maybe trying to achieve (and failed miserably).I can't help but be reminded of Avengers while watching this movie. Both have awfully simple yet over-the-top plots with groups of easily recognisable characters who spout comedic one liners between long action sequences. I don't particularly like Avengers movies but I can at least appreciate why they work (and are enjoyable) while this abomination doesn't. It's because the MCU actually has standalone films for the significant characters that establish the universe and their individual characters while the DCCU opts for the aforementioned 2-minute intro montages. This movie might have been worth something if these sequences had been movies beforehand. Hell, I'd have liked to see the Harley Quinn backstory with the Joker as an actual movie before this movie. Same for Deadshot, Killer Croc, Katana, El Diablo etc. They might have made good standalone movies and would have cleared the way for Suicide Squad to focus on being a good bit of over-the- top fun with a more fleshed-out story rather than also having to cope with introducing these characters and give them their signature personalities (which, as it is, is handled in the worst way possible that just makes them seem shallow and badly written). In conclusion; this film is the most blatant example of a film produced to sell merchandise to DC fans (who care about the characters regardless of the movies quality) or idiotic kids who want to seem edgy with a Harley Quinn obsession while avoiding the ""nerdy superhero comic fan"" stereotype. The characters are quickly and lazily introduced with over the top personalities that should be confined to short segments in trailers as opposed to the entire movie. Suicide Squad itself is a bland, stupidly simple sequence of boring, repetitive fight scene after boring, repetitive fight scene held together by the simplest and cliché style of ""imminent end-of- the-world"" story-line.This gets a 1/10. Even if I were a big DC fan I'd be ashamed to give this movie any more than a 4/10. In my opinion, real fans should be more invested in ensuring that quality films are made with their favourite characters rather than desperately defending a movie that, if anything, damages these characters.",Suicide Squad
1435,supersackboy,This movie is a waste of time,4,19 May 2017,"This movie was one of my most anticipated films of 2016. Unfortunately, I never got around to watch it when it came out originally. Months later, I finally got the opportunity to view it; I wish I hadn't. The movie has a very nice cast: Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie. Jared Leto's Joker felt very out of place and unimportant. He's only the movie for 12 minutes and he always felt forced. He just seemed too goofy and childish to actually be the Joker. Will Smith's Deadshot was probably the best performance, but even he seemed restricted in certain scenes. I don't know if it was the dialogue that he was given by the director or if he just wasn't feeling the character, but he would come across as uninspired during the later half of the movie. The main villain is predictable as hell as well. The entire plot could have been prevented if one lady was consistent with the ""stern vigilance"" her character was associated with, but she decides to be sloppy for seemlingly no reason. The plot is also goofy, with the final boss fight being extremely lackluster and unsatisfying. The only reason this movie isn't a complete bomb is because their are a few funny scenes (although all of them aren't intentional) and the universe itself it still fairly interesting. With that being said, you'd find more enjoyment reading the comics than watching the movie.",Suicide Squad

This movie barely even qualifies AS a movie. It's THAT ridiculous. I consider it basically a music video for teenagers to ogle Harley Quinn who is made so cringe-worthy by Robbie. There are hardly any movies I could think of at this level of budget that banked harder on a single characters' sex appeal selling out seats. It's so over-the-top in the trailers it makes me feel sorry for her and the production company for making such an obvious attempt to trade boners for ticket sales. Apart from all that, the characters are terrible. Will Smith who has a mountain of charisma somehow had zero in this film. I won't blame him. The rest of the crew are so terrible they don't even warrant a mention. Except for the Joker. He technically isn't PART of their crew but he is in there. Lord above who decided on THAT way to portray the Joker? Instead of a laughing and unpredictable madman we get some poor Halloween pimp/gangster. Seriously? Nothing about this movie was good.

Film begins well with the calm and pretty quite intro of characters and takes its time for setting the mood. Individuals were introduced quite well and there was just enough to help anyone understand them. Mood set, we're all ready to watch a heel lot of action! Wait, you won't get any!
Some of Batman's worst enemies and DC's most valuable villains come together to chat nonsense and walk on a reconnaissance mission in a city ruined by an ancient sorcerer... this is a recipe inviting disaster right from beginning. At one point one would wonder whether this is a film based on comic book characters or a ""BENEFITS OF WALKING 10 KILOMETERS EVERYDAY"" video. Dialogues were awfully half done for most parts and screenplay was awfully bad. Most of the film doesn't make sense until Amanda Waller is rescued and, even after that will viewers be left scratching heads while trying to justify random nonsense that was put up. Enchantress herself didn't seem interesting at all. Another thing that made no sense was the constant chattering of ""WE'RE THE BAD GUYS!"" We get it, you guys aren't good at all, so shut your mouth and either show flashbacks to justify it or do something that'd make it speak for itself.

1447,emad_eldin,A disappointment,4,9 August 2016,"Watching the teasers and the trailers, there was a great hype surrounding the movie. The idea of having all the villains doing good is so appealing, as most villains show more complexities and depth than the ""good guys"" which make them more human so to say.I've heard about the bad reviews but I thought that it will not be that bad, I mean how bad can it be.. with such low expectations, I was actually still disappointed.The plot is too shallow and as the story advances, the development is so naive that you'd think an 11 years old is writing the events, no offense to 11 year olds out there.Well, it is a comic movie, and although I am against that, but some would argue that as a comic movie you don't have to offer a profound story and in-depth character design as much as you have good technique in directing and impressive CGIWell, unfortunately these too also were rather disappointing, and at some point CGI looked stupid, not to mention that directing technique and even editing were lame, nothing impressive or eye catching more than an average early nineties action movie, with some advancements in picture and coloringTo be honest by the ending, and as everything was extremely predictable, I couldn't help laughing by the ending, and as I went out, I just felt what in the world went wrong, for such an anticipated movie, for all those people involved in this work, to make it as below average as this.",Suicide Squad
1448,michaelcrash,Not that bad,7,23 April 2019,"The movie overall is ok. A fun movie to go with your friends. Once.
From an actor point of view the performances were great. You can see Will Smith had a backstory. His acting was clear, simple and very effective. Same with Margot Robbie. Not only she was stunningly beautiful but she created a very charismatic Harley Quinn. Viola Davis has a very strong presence on screen and is very precise. Jay Courtney and Jay Hernandez are doing a very good job too. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was the counterpoint in some funny scenes and he did a great job.
Cara delevingne was quite average and I think she was casted because she looks very good on screen and no one can deny that.
I think Jared Leto was a casting mistake. He is one of the best actors in the world in my view. He can create a whole universe around him with just one role. But Joker was just not for him. He didn't brought anything new to the character, he didn't surprise me with anything. It was just there...
The story was strange. Amanda Waller ( Violla Davis) is bringing a witch to help them to fight a ""New Superman"" . Then she is making a ""Suicide Squad"" with some bad characters from the DC Universe to help with that . But the witch then turns out the be the real villain in this movie. And then all the bad guys from the Suicide Squad are sent to rescue her and lately to stop the witch. All of them have a device in their neck that will kill them if they disobey.
There are so many questions unanswered. How did Amanda Waller ( Violla Davis) survive after she was hung upside down and has a tentacle around her head. Why did Enchantress give them a second chance after her brother was killed by the Suicide Squad and she was so close to the world domination? How does Harley Quinn, a psychopath with a bat, manage to fool one of the most powerful creatures in the universe, a creature who can put visions in their minds. Why did Captain Boomerang come back so randomly after he leaves the bar. And so many more.
Anyway, there were some touching scenes that can make those questions go away very fast. The Joker( Jared Leto) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) scene where she is jumping in a water tank for him. The scene were Killshot (Will Smith) has to shoot Harley Quinn. The scene were Harley Quinn is crying in the rain after Joker's helicopter crash. And my favourite: the bar scene.
That scene was better than the whole movie for me. There you can see the background of the characters and why they are doing what they do. Especially Diablo. That character is amazing.
All in all if you like the DC Universe, tons of different and distinctive characters in the same movie and Will Smith killing monsters this is the movie for you.",Suicide Squad

But now with a harsh shellacking by prominent movie critics and an equally loud fan base shouting back, this movie has garnered more controversy than I think Warner Bros. and DC Comics were hoping for.

I love Jared Leto but the fact that he was trying WAY too hard to perfect his joker, ruined it for me. Margot Robbie did what I believe is the best she could with the awful screenplay they were given. For such an important and necessary character like Harley Quinn the way that they wrote her as someone throughout the whole movie was obsessed with some boy destroyed the potential she had. As much as I understand that's her 'thing' to be under the joker's spell, it was too much for the amount of action they tried to pack in. Speaking of action, each supposed 'action' scene was a massive let down. When you're watching these scenes you're supposed to be on the edge of your seat, and aching for the characters that are hit or almost dying, however in 'Suicide Squads' instance I just wanted it to be over. I was so excited to watch this, and it was such a huge let down. 2 hours of your life I'm begging you not to waste, go watch the new 'The Suicide Squad' which I promise you, you don't need to watch this one for, and this 2021 sequel is a great comeback from the let down released in 2016.",Suicide Squad
1455,strawberrymilkandgin,Great acting. Bad...editing?,4,10 September 2017,"I'll write about some of the things I haven't seen in the reviews yet so far.. I don't think it's possible at this point to spoil too much for anyone here because chances are, if you care enough about this movie to come to this review board then you've probably already seen the movie, and if you haven't seen it then you probably don't care enough to come to this review board :-) That being said; 1. This film won an Academy Award for best hair and makeup. It should have won an award for best trailer, because the trailer for this film has become famous in itself for being somehow better than the actual movie! I'll give you an example: when Mr. Boomerang Guy says ""You know what they say about the crazy ones.."" and then Harley glances over at him ""Huh?"" it works perfectly in the trailer, right? Unfortunately (spoiler alert) this scene falls completely flat on its face during the course of the actual film. That is just one of seemingly dozens of scenes that were ultimately (bizarrely) disappointing due to either bad writing, bad directing or bad editing. SO many bad lines of dialogue in this. I cannot fault the acting, because well, obviously it COULD have worked, just look at the trailer. Who knows, maybe someday it will attain postmortem status as one of those so-bad-it's-good cult classics, but I don't see how because in the end (spoiler alert) just a very run-of-the-mill superhero action flick which could have been spat out by one of those giant room-sized computers from the 50s. 2. Jared Leto's Joker is not the same as he comes off in the previews. Jared does the same thing here as he did when he played the villain in Panic Room where he imitated Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Here, he simply imitates Heath Ledger's Joker and winds up struggling as a cheapo, poor man's knock-off. God, I wanted to like that portrayal. I will get back to the Joker in a minute, because.. 3. This film relies HEAVILY on Margot Robbie delivering slick one-liners like, all the time, interspersed with gratuitous shots of her stripper outfit only covering half her butt. Granted, without Harley Quinn's charm this entire movie would be catastrophically one- dimensional. However, they should have taken the same approach with her as they did with the Joker and used the character sparingly.4. The Joker scenes that you actually DO get to see seem intentionally short and sweet to emulate Nolan's sparse use of Joker in The Dark Knight, but because of this directorial decision the Joker scenes instead end up feeling like a watered-down afterthought. This writer- director didn't develop the character enough! I give credit for trying something new-ish, but Leto doesn't even really get the chance to spread his wings and do much Joker stuff here so it fails at achieving the abstract vision that they were apparently going for. Like, why does he drive a hotrod? Why does he have capped teeth? And I hope you didn't want to see Batman himself, because he's only on the screen for about 12 seconds total! Again, probably not the actors' fault. Understandably they didn't want to make this into a Joker/Batman movie, whatever. 5. The obvious CGI wasn't TOO terrible, but then again, anytime you are aware you are looking at CGI while watching a movie it is a problem that the production team SHOULD feel compelled to contend with. Thankfully, the characters that do rely on CGI (Mr. Crocodile Guy, Mr. Fire Guy) are saved by their good acting.If this movie is your type of thing you should probably just continue to love it and not read the reviews here because some of them are severely harsh. Overall, it's quite evident that this writer-director was trying to go for a more comic book feel for this film than the majority of recent Gotham-themed features, but now I feel I must quote Deadshot: ""What are we, 12?""I mean, how much extra money did they need to pay Will Smith to yell the line: ""Lady, YOU ARE EVIL!!""

The look of the film, the costumes and overall aesthetic won me over. The humor was great. I laughed a lot. And most of the action works pretty well.The characters are a high point for me.Will Smith, Margo Robbie, Viola Davis and Jay Hernandez are STANDOUTS. I loved their performances as Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller and El Diablo, respectively. And Jared Leto's Joker is sinister. A different take compared to previous Joker incarnations. Playing a somewhat unhinged crime boss as opposed to a ""I want to see the world burn."" type of villain.The plot is not perfect. It has some weaknesses. and the villain is a bit uninspired. Which is unfortunate because his/her setup was thrilling. But I had the same issue with the villain in Guardians Of The Galaxy. So it is what it is. Overall, there are absolutely more pros then cons for me. I will definitely recommend Suicide Squad. Lots of fun.",Suicide Squad
1457,Fallen_Angel_Zoggy,Split between fandom and time.,7,8 August 2016,"I have read the comic's for years and when I saw a movie coming, I can't say I was too positive. Usually when a movie is made from a comic or game or a simple book you have read you will be pi**ed off at all the changes they have made to suit the director and/or actors of the movie. Unfortunately they can't all be made to suit the fans like for example marvels Deadpool.That being said, they did a great job of what they made. Most of these characters are from another time that we know and love, and inserting them in a present day movie is usually hard if not impossible, And for once when making a 2016 version of the same characters they hit bulls-eye. The characters are fun and well made and all but... That is all there is to it.The story-line was paper-thin so the movie felt more like a prelude explaining the characters so they can make a second movie. I would see it again, and probably will, but I'd be more hyped about turning it into a trilogy with the 2th and 3th movie having more of a story-line.",Suicide Squad

Despite having seen every Sharknado movie, which btw are made to be bad for a laugh, I still consider this to be worse.

1461,movienut666,"We're an average film universe, it's what we do",5,16 August 2016,"What Suicide Squad carries on from its trailers are the strong array of cast members and a delightfully bombastic soundtrack. If only they could spend half as much effort directing as they do on the marketing.As Suicide Squad began, I soon realised that the target audience are those with the mindset of a goldfish with attention deficit disorder, although this does help us part ways with the cringeworthy aspects of the film.The lively performances in Suicide Squad are what primarily save it from falling into the same bloated cesspool as Batman v Superman. Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, and Will Smith, all live up to my high expectations, although I was most surprised with Jai Courtney's performance, as he was able to act beyond the emotional range of wet dish cloth.I'm neither a comic fanatic or a teenager, so obviously this film isn't for me. However, seeing as DC are desperately trying to compete with Marvel, you would think that a good film with a broad appeal wouldn't be too much to ask for.Despite my criticisms, this is not the worst superhero film ever. However, if you have not been drafted into seeing this one with your friends, there are at least a dozen other DC films that are more worthy of your time.Your swiftly diminished expectations for Suicide Squad aren't going to kill you, but they just might hurt you really, really bad.I'll give this one a 5/10.",Suicide Squad

The best Harley Quinn ever and my apologies to the late Heath Ledger but Jared Leto ROCKS the Joker, insanely appealing! I've heard people complain that it is choppy but I didn't find it so. The acting on all parts was superb. Brings new life to old characters. Leaves you with many questions that I am sure will be answered at a later date. They really make you feel for the characters themselves even though they are pretty evil characters you realize they still have a heart. I want to see it again and again.

1463,Rhade,Harley Quinn saves the day,5,14 August 2016,"So DC Comics is desperately trying to catch up to Marvel's cinematic success after Batman vs. Superman's poor reviews and relatively poor revenue. Yet, I can't help but tell they didn't try very hard. I almost wish I had seen a rerun of 'The Scorpion King' instead, there was more tension and apprehension of evil forces there than in this movie that really only starts to get interesting around 51st minute (way to long after everyone's finished their drinks and popcorn)Up until then time has been wasted explaining the concept of the Suicide Squad without creating much soul to any the characters, except military-man Joel Kinnaman who gets more of a back-story than many members of the squad and still stands flat as a character (and actor) as his only trait apart from being a military-man is caring for June, who we also know nothing about except that she's possessed by an evil witch.Will Smith has played a string of heroes by now and this seems like his ""back-in-the-game"" flick where he just needs popcorn-time at the movies, USD;s in his pocket and doesn't care much about a good script. Even Academy-awarded Jared Leto's performance is overwhelmed by heavy make-up and fake silver-teeth and doesn't deliver a single one-liner worth remembering. Boo script-writers! Consequently iconic and usually deeply unsettling villain Joker is most remembered for... a long, almost avian-like laughter that re-appears a couple of times throughout the movie.So there is 1 character that keeps us wanting more, that delivers punch-lines and keeps the pace up. Little miss Harley Quinn is the hero of the villains or unwilling heroes, and displays a wider range of emotions throughout the movie than anyone else (tight-lipped Will Smith, open-jaw Joker or the British accent-wielding Enchantress)Lord knows how many would have fallen asleep in the theater if we didn't have actress Margot Robbie to bring life to Harley and to this dark and sad story. Yes dark and sad, not dark and exciting like director Christopher Nolan's captivating Batman-trilogy that reinvigorated DC's darkest hero after the 1997 unintentional seppuku (Japanese term for ritual suicide) of 'Batman & Robin'.Even in the 114th minutes, after 68,3% of the film, we're getting backstory to one of the characters. Really? Smell a sequel anyone? One I'm not looking forward to.Hero of the movie: Actress Margot Robbie Villain of the movie: Writer & director David Ayer Moment of Truth: In the final action build-up 6000-something years old witch Enchantress does a little arrhythmic dance to cast blue lightning and a few minutes later Deadshot screams ""You are evil!"" at her, to clarify the situation I presume...

1464,shortbread5,"Better than people say, could have been amazing, but still disappointing. Spoilers within.",5,27 January 2021,"The first third of the movie was great, surprising given the bad reviews. The build up and introduction of the characters was stylish, worked well, was fun, and was adult.It starts to change when they are getting changed into their mission clothes, the atmosphere lightens up, but not really in a good way, and the one-liners are a bit too staged as everything pauses while they are delivered not only here but also from here on in the movie.The mission they set out on quickly turns into bay-transformers-esque shooting and fighting which is a bit boring and cliched, and goes on for most of the remainder of the movie, interspersed with brief dialogues and plot points. Some tension manages to be created with the control that the mission leader has over them, but it's hard to take it seriously, especially when team member's like deadshot could have done away with the mission leader if they had wanted, what stops him? Morals?Morals and conscience are a truly interesting grey area here, in which the people in charge turn out to be if not as bad, then perhaps worse than the suicide squad themselves, which also raises the question of the team's obedience to such leaders. While there are discussions and intentions toward rebellion, they never really follow through, even at the end when all is said and done. Strangely the authority figure's criminal behaviour does not cause their authority to be questioned by the team, this especially applies at the end of the movie when the authority figure takes time off their jail sentences. It feels like Hitler telling some criminals they can be released early for good behaviour.The bar scene is missing some of the funny lines from the trailer, and Katana's decision to join them for a drink is an example of a 180 which makes no sense and doesn't get explained, and all the while they are drinking, soul-searching, and having their moral reckonings, the main 'evil' protagonist's world-crushing business gets conveniently paused.As to the joker, the role was done well despite people's disliking of this version, I can see how the actor didn't watch other versions in order to create their own, and they are convincing as a chilling, crazy, oddball villian. It was unusual to see the joker used in a love subplot, but this twisted infatuation was done okay, and was fairly entertaining.So overall don't expect clever plot points or everything to always make sense, don't expect satisfying fighting, though there are one or two interesting action pieces. The relationships are the most interesting part of the movie, and the team member's personal struggles end up being the most convincing thing about this fairly unconvincing movie, with Harley Quinn and Deadshot providing the most in this area, despite this Deadshot's acting is subdued, but Harley is believable. It is an antihero movie, and unapologetically unmoralistic, apart from that it follows some hollywood formulas, and could have been so much more, especially if it had kept the feel from the first third.",Suicide Squad
1465,carpathious,Confusing and horrible screening (Possible spoilers),2,5 August 2016,"I think this actually is the worst movie all year long.The introduction was horrific in that made 0 sense in the set up. I felt like the style that DC went with was close to Batman Forever when they went neon crazy.Only a few of the characters were done well, the rest were atrocious to the names they played. I don't blame the actors/actresses but the director and whoever wrote this movie. I am not sure how the actors weren't outraged by how complied the movie and left out (I am hoping left out) very important details about the story/characters.Random scenes will happen through out this movie that leave you in a confused state as to which why they were placed there. Other scenes in the movie cut out something that was crucial to the plot. Marvel does 1 thing well and that is the humor in the movies. DC almost completely left out humor. Most of the humor you already saw in the trailer and when you see it, its not that funny anymore. If you are a comic book reader or avid DC fan, you will not enjoy this movie. If you have no idea what is going on then you will most likely just see missed scenes and confusion.Deadshot, Joker, Harley Quinn really made this movie and truth be told...They needed more joker.",Suicide Squad

I was waiting for this movie for so long, I loved Suicide Squad in Assault on Arkham and I was so happy when the news arrived about the live action movie. And as a massive Jared Leto fan I was extremely happy they chose him for the role of my all time favorite character, Joker. So I was hyped to see him, but the whole gang too. And what I got from the movie was equal with pure sadness. I mean, Jared was in it for a total 10 minutes and his role could have been easily left out, I only knew the characters because I read the comics and watched the wonderful animation (which by the way a 100 times better), the story telling was HORRIBLE, the actors could have been wonderful but they kinda lost in the terrible script. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were fantastic but we didn't really get to know them... and the other characters were only there for... who know why? WHY DC, WHY? This story had so much promise and you ruined it... You should have adopted the Assault on Arkham into a live action movie... All these characters would needed a stand alone movie, and once we've got to know them then put them together... sure it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on, that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing!

This movie have so much rewatch value in my opinion. The soundtrack makes up a lot of why I really like this movie, but also the chemistry amongst the characters, the subtle comedy, and overall tone.The Suicide Squad pushed the comedy a bit more and the movie overall has a very different tone due to the fact that it's James Gun and not David Ayer as the director. Don't get me wrong, I like The Suicide Squad and the use of the R rating is decent, plus the comedy is funny most of the time. I just don't like it as much as the first one. Suicide Squad 9/10

First the positive things about this motion picture: the acting was good especially Margot Robbie who shines as Harley Quinn; the visual effects and action scenes were well made; soundtrack was also good and there were a few funny scenes. But my dear people that is about all positive from blockbuster from which I expected much more. Now the negatives things: David Ayer the director and writer of this movie did not do a good job, although I mostly like his previous work in this project the script was badly made especially the characterization of main characters; the directing was not impressive also; there were a lot of pathetic and unnecessary scenes, bad dialogues and simply put clichés; the plot was totally unconvincing and predictable. Generally speaking I am a big fan of superhero movies and I wanted to enjoy in this movies at the most, I could not. In my humble opinion, the only way in which this movie could work is that it is created as a parody, similar to Deadpool. Deadpool is much better and it is everything that this movie is not. For my final note this is the most fun bad movie I have ever seen, but from movie of this casting and budget of approximately 175.000.000 $ I expected much more.",Suicide Squad

I have been waiting to see this all year. I was disappointed. I thought, after seeing the first trailer, that is was going to be another dreary DC Comics film. Then the second and third trailers appeared, and I and countless others were led to believe that we were going to be treated to the second coming of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Well, guess what. The first trailer was the honest trailer. The people who made the second and third trailers lied to us.That stated, I didn't think it was as bad as the critics made it out to be. I didn't hate it the way I hated ""Batman vs Superman."" I liked the actors even when I didn't like their characters. Will Smith provided gravitas as the leader while Margot Robbie was the tomato in the salad. Viola Davis was solid but she played the kind of despicable bureaucrat that gets exposed by Jason Bourne.

There is almost no back stories for the characters and almost no screen time for the Joker.
 After the initial bad reviews I waited until the film came out on Netflix. 
On the positive side the actors are great fits for their characters, the effects are very nicely done, and Viola Davis and Margot Robbie stand out from the rest. 
I'm on the fence with Jared Leto's Joker interpretation though. This may be because there was not enough screen time for him to expand because at this point it seems ridiculous.",Suicide Squad
1474,bscott96,"My Suicide Squad Review - I'll say it, Its Fantastic",2,4 August 2016,"I want to start off by saying I went into this movie with pretty high but also controlled expectations with all of the negativity surrounding this film and I came out of this film and well I thought this film was awesome. Is action packed and just fun to watch. I don't get the very sting negativity toward this film and I just hope people will go and see it regardless of what the critics say. Lets start of with the positives, the Squad members and their chemistry is great. From Will Smith's Deadshot to Margo Robbie's Harley Quinn to Diablo and Killer Croc and Jai Courtney is great(for once) as Captain Boomerang. They all have their moment to shine from just a funny joke to being a complete bad ass when you don't expect much from the character(Diablo was a standout). Will smith as Deadshot was fantastic and I knew he would be good but was worried he would try to make it the Will Smith show with some guys in the background and surprisingly enough he actually shares the screen and doesn't try to take away from anyone else. Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn, Not since Robert Downey Jr. Has there ever been a more perfect casting of a character that perfectly embodies the character as Margo Robbie does as the Clown Prince of crime's girlfriend. She was amazing and and was a big stand out. But you already knew that from the trailers. Let's talk Jared Leto's Joke, is he the best joker ever? How does he compare to Heath Ledger and Jack Nicolson? Well the best thing I can say is he's different and in a good way. He's doing his own thing taking different and is a more modern take where he's this mob boss, gangster-type clown that everyone is terrified of. Every time he shows up I felt very uncomfortable. That's all I can ask for from Joker so he succeeded but I'm not ready to say he's the best. But he is great. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the woman who puts the team together, is just a straight up bitch and that's really the best thing I can say about her. I hated her so much but your supposed to and what she does really makes you sympathize more with the squad and root for them. The man in charge of leading the team is Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag, I was actually really surprised how much I enjoyed the character and Kinnaman's performance. Let's get to the action cause this is something that I heard was one of the issues going into the movie especially the climax which someone made comparable to Fant4stic's climax in 2015. I'm happy to say this is something I disagree with. The action in this film is fantastic especially in the climax. The storytelling of certain characters though flashbacks worked for me. I had a problem with the storytelling/editing in BVS it went as far as ruinous to the theatrical version . However the way they showed certain characters as what they were as opposed to now I actually thought worked and added more to the characters. I think they could have been done better but I think they worked in the context of introducing how the characters got imprisoned. Now let's get to some of my issues with the film. All movies have them and let's start with the villains, for a movie where the Director went out of his was to show off that DC has the better villains he sure failed at giving us a compelling villain for the squad to go up against. Now not to say the villain ruined the movie but the villains and what they trying to do isn't very interesting and just sort of happens. And with the villain comes the mission. It's just not as interesting as I had hoped but the squad' back and forth make up for it. My other big criticism with the film is the soundtrack. I felt they just threw in a song every other scene and I felt it undermined Steven Price's score, which was fantastic because WB or Ayer were trying to make a memorable soundtrack like Guardians of the Galaxy's (sorry to bring up Marvel) I enjoyed the music but I think there should have been far fewer songs and more score, it's a great score. I loved that theme and so disappointed they kept playing rap music when the theme should have been playing. Guys I had a blast with this film. Ayer nailed these characters where Snyder wanted to change characterizations, which is fine but it's refreshing to see a DC film where they got these characters right. They got Harley Quinn right, they gave us compelling characters with Deadshot and El Dioblo. I thought Croc and Boomerang were funny. Joker?, yes he's doing his own thing but he's Joker not this Jason Todd Bullsh*t, Red Hood re-imagining that a fan got from playing a video Game. He creeps me out and made me uncomfortable with what little scene he had and that's all I can ask for after Ledger and Nicolson. The villain yes is not good yet I enjoyed the ""swirling trash in the sky"" action sequence. The action scenes involving the villains were great. Yes, Even the issues I have, have redeeming qualities to them. I'm going give Suicide Squad a 9/10.",Suicide Squad
1475,sladethedirector,This movie is awesome,10,17 August 2016,"I don't know why everyone is saying that this is worse than Green Lantern and Fantastic Four. It is not that bad. The only complaints I have is that they cut a lot of Joker scenes and the mission makes no sense. Everyone's giving unfair criticism and being hard on this movie. I'm gonna defend this movie it's a lot better than Batman v Superman. At least the plot is simple and they didn't try to cram a lot of stories. David Ayer wanted to make a good movie and Warner Bros. didn't order Joker scenes to be cut, David Ayer did. These reports about expensive reshoots and alternative cuts are wrong. The difference between the released version and the original are the small amount of reshoots and they have 20-25 minutes of deleted scenes.",Suicide Squad
1476,traviesa-conejita,Everything wrong with comic-based movies.,1,10 August 2016,"My vote is 1 star which is ""awful"" according to IMDb, and awful just doesn't quite cut it. I would use dreadful, repugnant, and/or execrable.I follow DC and Marvel comics, and the purpose of bringing the characters and plots of these brands to live action is to go all out; and every time I see these types of movies, they are always a let down: characters are misused, under developed, and poorly constructed (and I follow comics, I can only imagine what those who don't feel or think); these movies spend too much time trying to make them--heroes/villains--into something that they have never been (in the worst way possible). How can this be??? The comics have done all the hard work, as a studio the only thing you have to do is give them flesh and blood, that is all!I go to see this movies for the action, for the possibilities CGI and SFX bring to fights, looks, and settings. I already care for the characters because I already know them, and even if I didn't, I do not need flashbacks every 20 min. I do not need to see Batman's origins every time a movie about him is made. I do not need forced humor from characters that don't do humor. I do not need powerful characters (referring to abilities and powers) just standing on the background looking at the camera and see in their eyes ""what am I doing here?"". I don't need heroes and villains making dumb choices (i.e. Superman wielding the kryptonite spear when you have Wonder Woman around; Enchantress, impervious to bullets with god-like abilities being defeated so stupidly easy; and don't get me started with her brother, defeated by an deus-ex-machina bomb when ""El Diablo"" was melting his heart and still he--the brother--had the upper hand). I don't need all that nonsense for characters that have been around for DECADES!!!Could these and other problems arise from the need for studios to make their movies appealing to a ""wider audience""? If so, I ask: What wider audience? Children? Seniors? Who? Who?? Because children don't have money to pay to see them, and seniors don't really care for them.Enough of ranting. Back to reviewing.Suicide Squad (SS) had tough shoes to fill because of ""Batman: Assault on Arkham"" (BAA, from here on). The last is an animated film with more or less has the same plot: get a bunch of ""bad guys"" to do some dirty work for Amanda Waller and, of course, everything goes sideways. Most of the characters are used in both movies: Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Cpt. Boomerang, and Joker. To those who are interested, I really recommend it, as well as ""Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox"". More often that I would like to admit, DC's animated movies are better made than live action ones. Harley Quinn in BAA is truly exceptional, funny, and every bit as psychotic and heartbroken as her comic book counter part. I don't know where this obsession with Margot Robbie comes from, but in most reviews I have read about SS, everyone sucks up to her performance and I only saw that she failed to take the next step to breakout and be Harley; she just took Harley's catch phrases and spitted them out in a very nice-looking package and all her character's jokes where terribly forced and didn't get a chuckle out of me. Deadshot, which is awesome in BAA, is just Will Smith being Will Smith, and that was a complete disappointment, the man had charisma, where did he left it? The only character I really liked better than his BAA counterpart was Jai Courtney's Cpt. Boomerang. I was really happy to see Jai Courtney act, and be, and giving his best like he did in Spartacus; because in other movies he has been he was very unsatisfactory. In SS he had the least character development, and still he made me laugh, he made me care for Cpt. Boomerang, and the thing with the unicorn was just really adorable. I am not going to address Jared Leto's Joker because the man had/has a very big smile to fill. The best Jokers for me are Mark Hamil, for voice acting; and Heath Ledger, for live action. Besides, the Joker has a better role in BAA than SS, in every way.But let me give another point of view: my mom's. She doesn't follow comics, nor cares for them, and she enjoyed the movie. She said it was entertaining and that, for a movie that is 2 hrs. long, it went fast. So maybe you should take her word rather than mine. Hopefully with all the money this movie has made, the studio will pay attention to fan's reviews and take note to do better in future projects. If not, I have learned my lesson with the past 16 years of comic-based movies and if I read and/or hear bad reviews, I'll wait until Netflix or Amazon, or whatever media to stream it and see it then, than wasting my money in theaters.",Suicide Squad
1477,mrh214,A chaotic mess that destroys every single hope you had before entering the cinema,1,6 August 2016,"The movie started off without any context at all. I had no idea what or who these guys were going to fight against. The wait to know was more boring than thrilling. The several dialogues being delivered were unnecessarily dramatic and felt totally forced. There were parts of the movie where I admired the action and acting but most of it was just pure garbage. The movie tries to play on your emotions all too often but fails to do it in an integrative way. What bothered me most was the movie's editing and storytelling. It is as if they put together random scenes in the last moment. There were more satisfying scenes in Batman vs Superman than this mess of movie. However, there were people in the cinema who laughed at some of the corny jokes and applauding after defeating the stony robot things. Perhaps, if you have a good base in DC comics and don't care about mediocre scripts, then this movie should be just fine. It is filled with action and dramatic dialogues which when Individually taken out, can be presented as a good home movie made by a DC fan.

1478,TokyoSeoul,Go Watch Batman the animated series instead!,5,9 August 2016,"This movie I went into expecting exactly what I came out with. And that was indifference. I love DC comics! But a lot of the comic book movies have be trying too hard to bring them into the real world. Special effects constantly and bland over all villains made this movie tedious to watch. Honestly Gotham should not feel like LA or New York to anyone, they are comic book worlds. So 'modernizing' characters with tattoos everywhere,gang banger tactics, show downs at clubs, making everything about sex is just disturbing. Why was it more appealing to make Harley wear underwear and a creepy t-shirt rather than her court jester outfit? Because you can only be the ultimate bad guy if you have skin showing and are a sex kitten? I don't think so, bad ash villains come with class, dignity and just a pinch of crazy! The army enchantress created was terribly weak...but somehow the millions of bullets the Gotham task force fired couldn't hit one of those guys. Then you see Harley Quinn is killing them with a wooden bat. Yep OK. The dialogue seemed to be made up on the spot,flat and dull and lewd with swears tsk tsk. Violence towards women is always a crowd pleaser and yet it's NOT! Superheros and even the villains use to live by a code it's sad they thought it'd be cooler without it. Another big uh-oh was the music in the movie.I know everyone has their own soundtracks to life but the constant changing of songs was pretty annoying honestly. Finally the biggest thing I could not look past was the Joker/Harley Quinn moments. There was too many back stories, they really should have just made their own movie about them if they wanted to go that way. The Joker never loved or cared about Harley, she loved him but he abandoned her. I heard they were going to go that way but test audiences didn't like it. But why even make a movie about any of these characters if you're just going to change them into new ones. And finally my last grudge against Suicide Squad, The Joker laughs like the Penguin but I have always liked the Penguin more. 5 stars because it could have been worse but it definitely could have been better! If you want the best DC comics stories I suggest (other than reading the comic books) watching Batman the animated series. All the same characters but none of the ridiculousness of this movie. The characters in the animated series stay true to the comics and the stories always the viewers coming back for more.",Suicide Squad
1479,Solamortis,OK film,6,7 August 2016,"Overall the movie was fairly enjoyable.Harley Quinn was awesome and made for most of the funny moments in the film, though her scenes with Joker suffered.Will Smith would not have been my first choice as Deadshot but his performance was typical Smith.Waller was extremely well acted.Jared Leto's Joker was horrible. His character was more like a small time gang leader with bad teeth than a mob boss. The sounds that he kept making were annoying at best.El Diablo's back story was the best and his fight at the end while predictable was fun to watch.",Suicide Squad
1480,ben2016,Trying too hard to be DC version of Gaurdians of the Galaxy,1,6 August 2016,"It was a fun, happy movie, don't get me wrong, but I felt like that it was trying too hard to be a very funny and special movie, but it failed to become one, and as a result it looked like a failed movie and try! Suicide Squad, as its own movie, is a good movie. Grab some popcorn, and enjoy the action, have fun and leave, and that's all about it. And I could give it a solid 7 or even an 8.But for some reason, I guess rivalry between DC and Marvel, DC wanted to have its own Guardians of the Galaxy; a bunch of misfits, oddballs, thieves, murderers, who unite to do some good and save the world or their city. But Suicide Squad miserably fails to live up to the bar set by Guardians of the Galaxy,and as a result I consider the mission of this movie a failure! But this could be a great movie on its own if they just wanted to enjoy themselves and produce some thing fun rather competing with Marvel.I could see multiple counterparts between Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy in terms of characters, dialogues, scenes, and even music. I felt like that the writer/director of Suicide Squad watched Guardians of the Galaxy multiple time, and created his version of the movie out of it! And he failed! A good percent of the jokes felt forced and they fell flat! Some of them were funny, but not all of them. Again, I am going back to my original comment; the movie was trying too hard! It was nice to see Will Smith again! He was good as Deadshot. But I think he director could give more space and freedom to Will. Will is a funny, likable man, and the Characters he play are like that as well. I think he could have more screen time. In this movie he was too much restricted and limited by the rest of the plot line, which wasn't as likable as him.Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie! I have contradictory feelings toward this character. In some scenes she was funny, but the rest not so much. Her screen time and role could be reduced and limited to just funny and interesting part. Don't get me wrong, Harley was trying hard to deliver, but they gave her too many lines and jokes to deliver, and a good percent of them were not funny or interesting to begin with! I really disliked the new Joker played by Jared Leto! Of course it is hard to live up to Heath Ledger version of Joker. I am not even comparing the new Joker with Heath. I am unable to put my finger on the main reason that I disliked the new Joker. Bad casting, bad direction, unclear role of the Joker in this movie? I don't know! I just didn't like the new Joker! I really liked Viola Davis as Amanda Waller! I hope I see her in future DC movies, and it seems that it will happen based on what they show at the end of the movie (Batman+Waller scene).Also Cara Delevingne did well in this movie. She is a model, not an actress, but she was able to deliver it.Overall, it is a good way to spend two hours of your weekend. But it could be much better if they had taken it easy and hadn't tried too hard!",Suicide Squad
1481,fidamaswad7,"over-promoted but better than BvS, proving Ayer a better director than a writer.",7,23 August 2016,"In this unique conceptual but over-promoted film, we get to see the very first theatrical live-action portrayal of Harley Quinn done by talented Margot Robbie, it really a is nightmare to do a character which is entirely a crack-brain and psychotically sally, despite of Harley being one of the famous character in the comic world and the whole world expecting a metaphoric Life & Death situation kind of a performance for a character with a scarce back-story, Robbie has done justice to the character, her performance is the only half which makes this movie vigorously enjoyable to watch, her performance makes Harley the female version of Joker with an additional touch of softness for the distressed ones, which reminds me of how fondly the character fell in love with psychotic Joker in the 1997 animated Series named 'The New Batman Adventures'(SPOILER ALERT) The most disheartening element of this execution for me was, the over-hyped, but less exhibited Joker, the character felt like shoehorned into the film, now imagine yourself wearing shoes smaller than your feet and running around feeling the pain, that might be the exact pain Jared Leto must have felt after watching the final piece, you just don't get to play with a character this big like an unprofessional, this is disappointingly deceptive to a man who is extremely talented and dedicated, Jared Leto as Joker has done a stunning job, creating a different torpid yet energetic ruthless vibe to the character, with a parlous yet grasping laugh, despite of the less screen time Leto succeeds in for you to have high hopes for the character in future productions.

1482,volcomsd615,Wow!!! This was awesome,10,4 August 2016,"DC movies been hitting it out of the park this year, I'm just so bore and tired of all this Disney marvel movies. Take civil war for example, you kill crossbones in the first 15 minutes, the guy that suppose to kill Cap. enough about marvel, Suicide Squad was great if you know any history of the comic, and yes the joker is not in it that much, but if you read the comics you know it's not about the joker or batman, it is focus on the squad. The movie have great acting, visuals, sound and action.It was just a fun movie overall, don't listen to the critics or all this sheep who just agree that every Disney marvel movie is great. I can't wait for justice league and wonder woman movie, they're going to awesome.",Suicide Squad
1483,nikh1996,Not great but not worse as the critics put it either,6,5 August 2016,"Minor spoilers: The movie is not bad as the critics are pointing out but yes it's not good either... Just keep in mind when going to the movie that JOKER IS NOT THE BIG VILLAIN and I felt he should have been.Pros: +Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller and El Diablo were awesome! Jared Leto as Joker was convincing (NEEDED MORE SCENES) + First 20-25 minutes were stylish as the trailers depicted + The final parts were also awesome if you would forgive the clichéd storytelling + Great JL cameos...CONS: - RICK FLAG. I didn't sympathize with him and he was as Deadshot put it: ""A crappy leader"" - Not a great villain and really generic plot (That effect seriously reminded me of Fantastic Four) - The mid portions were being draggy - Some flashbacks need not have existed - Some soundtracks felt really offFinal verdict: This movie is supposed to be DC's savior and it's not... But it is also not a DC Cinematic universe killer as some point out as the actors in it are actually genuine in their character counterparts... Would love to see the villains in other films of the cinematic universe",Suicide Squad
1484,slaystation2135,I dozed off,4,31 March 2017,"If you're familiar with the DC universe you probably have an idea (even a vague one) about it without somebody elaborating.I don't usually read reviews before watching certain kinds of movies. Even though I try to avoid trailers, the hype, marketing and information in general tends to get to me anyway.Suicide Squad is exactly that kind of movie...I really wanted to see it even before bits and pieces of information got to me. After I ended up watching a trailer (which didn't have anything new for me by then) and a few ads - I was definitely sold. However, I didn't go to the cinema and managed to watch it after it was released on DVD.To get to the point, it wasn't just bad – it was terrible!If you're into super hero stuff, checking out whatever DC (or Marvel) throws at you, you're gonna watch this anyway. I was lucky to see it after being released on DVD, so I was able to skip back and see the action I missed whenever I fell asleep.That's right, the action happens to be the most dreadful part!So, here it is, without spoilers:A secret government agency bands together the most dangerous super villains to form a defensive task force which is supposed to save the world from the Apocalypse.Personally, I might go out on a limb by saying that none of the villains are super. I could be wrong because I might have missed it (during the action).Since we're talking about the DC universe, I can't really say that character development is unrealistic. While each and every one of them is lacking depth, they're also inconsistent with previous successful representations in highly rated movies (but that's been done before so it's nothing to scoff at).THE GOOD: I liked the trailers, the actors and (almost) everything about it before seeing it. In fact, some of the best parts are in the trailers and the marketing.I have to admit I've had a few laughs hearing some of the lines""I put him in a hole, and threw away the hole.""But that's about it.You might wanna check out this poster too - it looks like a villainous mushroom cloud.THE AWFUL: I don't think the actors can be blamed for any part of this mess. Actually, they did quite a good job considering the circumstances and the characters they had to play.The Joker? Huuuge joke. Somebody obviously forgot about ""The Dark Knight"" (2008) which was a masterpiece, with Heath Ledger's excellent interpretation of the Joker.I'm not saying Jared Leto was bad – in fact he was really good. I'm gonna go as far as saying he did a perfect job playing the role he was given in this fiasco.Batman? Why would they give the role to someone else while Christian Bale nailed it? Repeatedly While Ben Affleck didn't play a poor Batman, in my opinion he was a perfect Daredevil (2003).Supporting cast aside, even with Will Smith in his shoes, Deadshot didn't exactly fit the profile of a villain.Neither did Harley Quinn or anyone else for that matter (at least not in the sense they were advertised).The beginning seemed promising, especially with the introduction of these two, but it just didn't deliverTo wrap it up, you should wait till you see it on TV. That's the only way to make sure you won't be sorry.But can you wait for that long?",Suicide Squad
1485,nirupam-astro,Lots of fun parts but meaningless story-line :(,6,7 August 2016,"Suicide squad is more fun than the serious tone of Batman v Superman. It has a lot more humour. Characters are surprisingly funny and there are lots of jokes and one-liners that are total hit. Even Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang is a likable presence (yeah miracles do happen).Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller are the stand out performances. Will Smith does a decent job as Deadshot. He is one of the few characters in the film who has been given any bit of characterization. I did enjoy watching the new portrayal of Joker. But his appearances were few, made no sense in the context of the plot and felt very random. So don't go to the movie expecting a lot of the Joker. Out of all the characters in this movie, Katana's character was the biggest wasted opportunity. But the weakest point of the movie is the antagonist. None of the fight scenes have any real tension or meaning. In short, you will like the first act, but will find it hard to stay connected in the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film. And you will be annoyed with the finale. I'm giving 7 rating only because of some awesome acting from the previously mentioned characters.",Suicide Squad
1486,nasifonline,This is a total disgrace to the DC Villains,2,26 August 2016,"The whole plot of the movie was a mess. It really confused me what all the characters in the film was fighting for, I mean there was no real goal of the movie for the first 70% of the time. Then they set up the story in a way where the friend turns into the foe, and those friends are now facing this foe as their primary enemy and not the one it was shown at the beginning of the movie. I think the whole script was written by a total non professional guy who needs to again go through the basic levels of a film school. This movie made DC lose its fame towards its fans and I hope they bounce back in their next show. Thank you",Suicide Squad

I was waiting a long time for this, but i have disappointed for the fact that the most of good scenes appears in trailers and the other movie previews. I was expecting to see more information and more scenes about the characters. Especially from Deadshot and Harley Quinn. The story was predictable but i knew that, so i focused to the actor's performance. And that was i like more on the movie. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jay Hernandez and Jared Leto performance was great. Music, sound effects and direction is pretty good, and all that CGI scenes make the movie interesting and enjoyable. For sure it worth to watch it. I hope will soon see and the sequel of the movie.",Suicide Squad
1488,theknucklejoe,My First Experience in the DCEU... eh.,7,25 December 2016,"I haven't seen Man of Steel or Batman v Superman, and I didn't go see this in theaters, either. Watched it tonight. It's kinda like what I expected it to be. Highly stylized, with some fun action sequences (though with some pointless, doofus-y slow-mo thrown in here and there-what is this, 1995?) It was pretty to look at. Not much more value to get out of it, though.Too much was shoved into this. This would've maybe been better as a standalone Deadshot movie, insofar as he has the most compelling backstory and development. It seemed a bit like Will Smith playing Will Smith, however. Him, Flag, and evil CIA lady seemed like they could belong in the same movie, but the others felt out of place. Harley Quinn was fun, but didn't seem like she belonged. Diablo, Killer Croc, and Katana could've been in a move with the Enchantress and her brother, but Deadshot, CIA lady, Flag, and Harley Quinn seem really weird to be there. And then there's Captain Boomerang, heh... He seemed fun too, but he does next to nothing. Take him, Katana, and Killer Croc out, and it's practically the same movie. Perhaps even Diablo, though he gets a bit more development than they do. A bit.I'd heard complaints about the character origin flashbacks at the start of the movie... and yeah. It involved a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. Sure, there were scenes with important events for Deadshot and Harley, but there's no set up for any of these scenes; CIA lady just tells us what happened with them, essentially. It's just flashy cuts between a few important images, and a couple cameos for superheros to show up. We're even told that Flag and this archaeologist girl, Moone, or whatever ""fell in love"" because CIA lady made them fall in love or something, so she could use it against Flag. We are not shown any development of this relationship of theirs. We're also not given any buildup for the Enchantress.Then, there's a few character actions and scenes that don't make much sense to me. How did CIA lady get Enchantess's heart? Furthermore, how did CIA lady know that the Enchantress had possessed Moone? Are there cameras in that ancient site? They went there later and found the heart, but why would the Enchantress leave it behind? Like, what happened in the scene directly after she possessed that girl? Of all the quick origin flashbacks, this was one that needed further explanation the most. Then with the team, itself: they didn't care about each other. At all. Thhey showed mostly disdain for one another throughout the first half of the movie. Then they found out they were going to save CIA lady and not... someone else, and also that CIA lady is ultra ruthless and evil. Deadshot watched her kill a bunch of her subordinates one scene, and is so casual about it, I assumed he didn't care. He also told Harley that he didn't feel love, or else he wouldn't be able to sleep at night with all the people he's killed, yet he clearly loves his little girl, and he also purposefully misses shooting Harley when told to, even though he showed no attachment previously. Captain Boomerang felt moved to compliment him for his mercy, even though, like Deadshot, he had made no prior indication of caring for any of his team members (or anyone else at all, really). So then they have the bar scene, tell each other why each other person is terrible, we get a little bit of character development for Diablo, and then Deadshot decides to help Flag fight the Enchantress--not because she's about to destroy the world, but because of honor or camaraderie or something. And Harley's got nothing better to do,and the others give no reasoning for going whatsoever (particularly puzzling with Captain Boomerang, who had bolted once Flag said they were free to go).As far as character development goes... Deadshot is a ruthless assassin, but loves his daughter. Threatens everyone constantly. Has a change of heart suddenly in the middle of the movie. Why? Harley Quinn is a psychiatrist treating the Joker. She falls in love with the Joker. She gets abused by the Joker. She gets rejected by the Joker. She gets accepted by the Joker. The Joker falls in love because she's crazy enough to jump in the same generic vat of chemicals that he fell into to turn him into the Joker, which I guess the sole affect of is to make people totally bananas. She went from obsessed psychiatrist to crazy girl, then just kinda goes along with whatever's happening around her, though she claims that the team are her ""friends"" as as she slice's the Enchantress's heart out.Kinda similarly, Diablo refers to the group as another ""family"" that he doesn't want to lose. For him, he was evil, had a wife that tried to reason with him, then gave up and was leaving, he gets mad and kills her and their kids in a rage, then realizes ""hey, I'm evil,"" and tries to be a pacifist, until Deadshot yells at him a bit in one scene. Katana has a very brief backstory involving revenge for her dead husband (she showed up late because she was ""busy..."") And Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang have no development whatsoever. The Enchantress and her brother's existence barely have any kind of explanation, let alone their motives.It's just kinda a mess. An entertaining mess, but a mess nonetheless. I've liked David Ayer's movies in the past, too (Fury). I dunno if this deserves a 7, but I feel like a flat 6 is too low. So yeah.",Suicide Squad

They are not built up at all. they are boring also You do not know them two much during the whole film.Additionally it has not too much actions the discussions are too long and does not have any sense.The final battle was the worst that I have seen in the past few years.So all together I do not recommend to anyone.

1491,jsmith-marvelous,"Lot of style, but no substance.",5,5 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a train-wreck. Let's just get that out of the way right now. Jared Leto's Joker was teased heavily in all the trailers, posters, magazine ads, and TV spots, but he makes an astonishingly short (and pointless) appearance in the movie, only appearing a handful of times for a combined total of probably less than 7 minutes. Though that's probably for the better - Leto's Joker is less a theatrical, serial-killer mastermind and more of a general psychopath with a gun and a grating laugh. Harley Quinn's relationship with Joker is practically nonexistent in this movie - they touch on a few key cornerstones of what people know from the comics or animated shows, but not in any detail and not for long enough for anyone to take it seriously. The whole draw of Harley Quinn's character is that she used to be a respectable, well-meaning doctor before Joker twisted her into what she becomes, but in this movie, they make her out to basically be a lovesick puppy with no brain whatsoever. She basically exists in this movie to be the slapstick comic relief. Will Smith is great - but he doesn't bring anything to playing Deadshot, except to make him into another typically Will Smith ""I'm cocky and I mouth off"" persona. The plot goes absolutely nowhere. For a good 20 minutes of this movie, nothing is shown but a series of music montages. The rest of the movie seems pieced together from scenes that seem like they were shot only to be placed in the trailer. (It's a fantastic trailer, to be fair.) Whole lot of style, not a lot of substance, and just like the villain of this story, the Suicide Squad movie lacks heart - and that's why it's getting the reviews it has been. There are a ton of ""wow, cool"" shots and scenes in this - like June Moon's first transformation into Enchantress or Killer Croc's eyes gleaming from the darkness of his cell - but they're nothing more than a bit of flair.",Suicide Squad

1494,pureorangeness,Appeals to a certain demographic but is a JOY for those people in question,7,13 August 2016,"Do I think this saves DCEU after the disaster known as BvS? No. Will I be sad if Warner Bros decides to reboot DCEU due to poor reviews and box office results? Heck no. But I am glad this movie is made, for properly depicting the members of Suicide Squad and being what it is: A comic book movie for people who like and/or are interested in the characters it depicts. This movie is a solid 7/10 for me and I acknowledge that this score will change for someone else with different expectations from movies as a whole.I am in love with this movie. I am in full acknowledgment that this movie was purely made as a knee-jerk reaction and as a shameless rebellious mindset with little base to support itself, and it should be obvious to anyone that this movie has a myriad of flaws. I am not ashamed of excusing these flaws to enjoy a proper depiction of really, REALLY underrated comic book characters like Deadshot, Katana and El Diablo. This movie makes me care about characters I don't think I would ever care about, and that's a definitive plus if you ask me.I don't know what the critics were expecting from this movie but I have somewhat of a theory. I did also like Warcraft: The Beginning (despite me having absolutely no knowledge on Warcraft lore) when it was absolutely destroyed by the critics. Warcraft and Squad both have supernatural elements in their story lines that were not properly explained in their origins and they expect you to believe these elements just happen to exist. I think MCU and The Dark Knight trilogy spoiled everybody in that regard: They try to ground their superheroes in a believable setting that could exist within our own reality. This is a movie where we are expected to believe ancient artifacts can encase supernatural beings, a human being can born with pyrokinesis, and a katana sword can entrap souls of its victims.The story was simplistic alright, but it works on the story's benefit. You don't need to know much about the story other than these are bad people with criminal record and due to their unique specialties they were chosen to assume roles in a governmental response team to possible supernatural attacks. This is a lovely premise and I cannot think of a better team to embody this idea. Sure, half of the team is vastly over-powered compared to the rest like, say, Captain Boomerang, it becomes downright comical: but movie downright acknowledges it and SUBTLY addresses to it when other characters find it socially awkward to point that out.The main squad members were on point. Killer Croc sadly pales in comparison, but efforts were made to involve him in the story. Slipknot does not live for long, but he serves his purpose. Margot Robbie is wonderful and her depiction of Harley Quinn brings more than just a sex toy for the Joker: She shows duality, she shows ingenuity. This Harley is a character worthy of her lore. Characters like Will Smith's Deadshot, El Diablo and Katana, certainly surpass their lores and bring intense amounts of humanity to their characters. The rest aren't as well developed but they share a comic relief spot altogether and it definitely works. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller and Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag also bring more to the table than expected. The villains are okay, the depiction of Enchantress and his brother Incubus was lovely, although the latter was fragged a bit easily IMHO. They were depicted as vastly powerful beings but Incubus was taken out a bit easily comparatively.And to be honest, this leads to another theory of mine: This movie reminds me of a perfectly good session of a game of FRP, like Dungeons and Dragons but ofc in a modern superhero setting. I love when movies do that. We start with established characters telling their backstories, banding together with their own specialties to bear through minion encounters with memorable details, and then they take down the big bad for some loot. Just like that, not always every character's dice rolls like it should, and sometimes a poorly thought move deals devastating blow as if their character rolled a 20.Jared Leto's Joker is completely underwhelming. He is miscast and his method acting is nil. Due to the fact that he's extremely cut from the movie benefits the movie tenfold. He serves some bit of purpose in the story to elevate Harley's character and then he storms off (kinda). I don't think his persisting presence would in any way help the movie from that point onwards. And I don't really care Despite how this movie's advertised, this is not a Joker movie, this movie has more to do with Harley than him, and Harley was done so well I don't care about Joker. I believe they designed him to be a modernized version of Jack Nicholson's Joker, and I absolutely despise Jack's Joker (and Tim Burton's vision of the Batman lore as a whole) and I believe everyone who show a baseless respect to Jack Nicholson's Joker while simultaneously hating on Jared Leto's Joker to be completely contradictive, if not selective and biased. The only difference between Nicholson and Leto except the gangsta motifs of their characters is that Nicholson is naturally charismatic when Leto is a black hole of charisma. While charisma is a big part of Joker's character, Tim Burton's Batman ruins Joker's character in so many other ways it doesn't matter anyway. Everyone got their best Joker out of The Dark Knight. Move on.I like this movie a lot and I think this was a movie made for people like me and it's a hard thing to find when comic book movies are so marginalized and marketed towards a wide audience. I am glad and will definitely take this movie as a perfectly beautiful standalone movie when DCEU is discontinued.",Suicide Squad

There was so much missing in the way of writing, plot, character development, character interaction, and a connected story line that I must believe that the originally recorded version has been cut to ribbons for theatrical release. How can DC release such garbage after the excellence that was the two of the three Batman movies (Bale)? Even the weakest of the Batman trilogy, the last one, is 5 times the movie this is. The writing in The Dark Knight is secondary to very few movies that have ever been made.... but for this, I think they hired kids from the local sandlot to be writers! In the grand scheme of the comic-book-based movies of the past 10 years, I think this is the very worst!

1497,lukereaney,No Oscars here,6,18 August 2016,"The reason I'm writing this review is because this movie was set up very well over the first 40 minutes or so, but then took a tumble leaving me disappointed and angry. The back-story for each character near the beginning was the highlight of the movie; in truth they needed more of this. Another positive feature was the choice of songs in the soundtrack. The enchantress was an excellent character until she turned into a less scary, predictable, cliché villain with cheesy lines and a frankly awful side-kick brother. In fact, it was the point she resurrected her brother in the tube station where this movie began its downward spiral. This was epitomised by the predictable plot towards the end - nothing original, we've seen it all before. The attempt at humour by the killer croc was cringe worthy, I honestly can't believe they included it. It's the type of humour we used to enjoy as 10 year old's, which is pointless considering the age rating of 15. This movie needed to be more serious, with a greater fear factor like the cave scene where we meet the enchantress. The producers failed to target the appropriate audience throughout the movie and this is reflected by the poor reviews. Suggestions: 1) why couldn't the enchantress have an even more evil sister (instead of the brother) who she resurrects with detrimental consequences? 2) no cheesy croc jokes. In fact, no croc whatsoever. 3) a smaller army of villains, but scarier and more dangerous. 4) more scenes of the suicide squad being awesome, particularly dead eye - what's the point of including a character with incredible aim if the villains are going to be max 10 metres away?

I was sitting in the theatre just thinking that this isn't all that great, and it's simply down to the plot as the acting was superb and any return of these characters in other movies are justified by their performance in Suicide Squad.I'm one of those guys that really liked Batman vs Superman, the Ultimate Edition even more so, but I understand why other didn't which is fine. But I'm scratching my head as to why I didn't enjoy Suicide Squad more than Batman vs Superman. I will give it a 7/10 as I enjoyed many moments, easter eggs and characters, I just felt the story let this one down.",Suicide Squad
1499,edramsey496,Everyone seems to be complaining and I can't understand why...,6,11 August 2016,"Magic would be my first point of call when trying to criticise Suicide Squad. I'm up for most things within the semi-realist settings DC and Marvel give us, but for me, some of the Aztec God magic got a little out of hand. I mean Batman may as well be dead if the villains in these things are that powerful. But I get that you need a lost cause denouement before a battle finale closes the deal. I think there is something to be said for cutting edge movies, whether they are full of themselves or not. In this case, perhaps the confidence in its own novelties mirrors that of some of its characters, rendering the entire concept what should be a secret garden for critics, and a minefield for the less apt at subtext. Intentionally or accidentally, Suicide Squad has done something different, not with its style or themes, approach to storytelling or even with the story itself; but with its dangerous attitude towards all of these things. We're thrown into a movie which kind of knows what it's doing- an unfunny Edgar Wright style overblown 'meta- human' movie- and that's good enough for some, but I like to tear a bit at the corners. In terms of consistency, David Ayer is a little shaky here and there. I don't know where Killer Croc comes from for instance and I don't care, a mistake here as he could have been a good character. Unfortunately he was used for awkward out of place jump-humour, the worst type of humour unless it's done by Will Smith or Margot Robbie, and they at least use it to enhance the feel of the scene, not shatter it. Still though, I absolutely loved this film. Yes, it has its faults and its five second cringe moments, and its gross overtones of the words 'fat budget' written on every chopper, fireball or Aztec ring of power. But what film nowadays doesn't have that? The key is to pretend not to see all of it. Let's talk more about the good stuff then. I'm not going to say Jared Leto was a step up from Heath Ledger, but he certainly wasn't a step down. After Ledger, I don't think it would be possible for a fan such as myself of his work to simply say 'clean slate' Joker- wise. But I can compare them. Leto brings a slightly more empathetic approach to the role, but with a darker, crazier variation on the insanity. Our Joker here is a very deeply disturbed, although less explained, Joker who is...in love? Yes, I suppose so. Leto did do the whole method actor thing whilst basically doing a Heath Ledger reboot but with a love story tied in. Now that I write this that realisation has hit me, and I feel annoyed. But I loved his performance, I guess you can understand why. The script, minus the flaws I've mentioned, was solid. And I almost didn't notice that most of the characters motives slipped into any writer's default: love. It's not a poor plot default, but it felt a little tired to me. Regardless, the screenplay didn't get to a point where I might get disconnected from everything, and the subtleties were well placed, the characters well written (aside from the crocodile guy) and the dialogue both believable and collaborative with the film as a whole. What the script also does well, is take us on an emotional journey as well as a war movie one, we do get to see the sides of these characters we haven't seen before. This is one of the things I had no fear that Ayer wouldn't do. But I think it worth noting that this is still an accomplishment to be applauded. I even liked the occasional self-referential lines, which if anything is an achievement in itself because usually I find them clichéd, arrogant and tiresome. Not in this case though, everything was well balanced. The performances from everyone else were just as fantastic, and I could not stress enough how happy I am that the movie starring two of the most stunning (wink) actresses today, only made them spend 98 percent of their screen time dressed somewhat seductively. Stylistically, I don't know what other critics are complaining about, the use of colour is fascinating and brilliant- highlighting the very nature of the message of the film as well as the various characters in an almost impressionistic way. Tonally, Suicide Squad appears convoluted, but one can always make stuff up. It could have been for instance, that that was the entire point, the style helps us get into the messed up heads of these psycho-super villains and better understand their perception of the world around them...or it's just more fun to watch a film at this scale doing something more exciting than relentless slow motion shots of death scenes we've seen a thousand times, or a five minute funeral procession no-one in the audience can believe or accept because the chance is too high that the character isn't actually dead by the end of it- total waste of time. And yes, that was a gentle dig at Batman Vs Superman. Suicide Squad and Deadpool have for me made an excellent contribution to their genre- a genre I would even venture to say is a new creation. I like it, evidently some don't.More from me at edramsey496.blogspot.co.uk",Suicide Squad
1500,tron38,An honest review,8,7 August 2016,"Overall, I liked it a lot. For reference, I like Marvel and DC equally, and I loved BvS (and anything with Batman).The visuals were amazing, the characters were fun (although, I agree under developed), good use of music, and the fight scenes were cool.However, it was not without faults. Warner took some heat due to the run time of BvS, but the Extended Blu Ray was much better. I say, make the movie as long as it needs to be. I can deal with a 3-hour Saving Private Ryan. Also, the sub-villains, the mindless enemies they fought, just felt like they were there for target practice. They reminded me of the droids in Star Wars Episode 1. Also, I thought Leto's Joker was at times a copy of Heath. He even sounded like him a few times. I was not impressed. I've heard, however, many of his footage was cut, so I look forward to the Blu Ray. Great movie, go see it!",Suicide Squad
1501,andycostin1,Margot Robbie makes this film!,10,26 September 2021,"I had to give it 10 for Margot Robbie alone. I personally kinda loved this film. Yes it's choppy, lacks any real storyline, but it still feels like a fun ride!",Suicide Squad
1502,cambroon,Awesome movie don't listen to critics,10,6 August 2016,"One VERY minor spoiler. So I just got back from seeing Suicide Squad for a second time and my opinion hasn't changed; it's awesome. Is it the best superhero film ever? No, but it's certainly in the top ten maybe even top five. Defiantly the second best DC film of all time after the Dark Knight. The film is getting a lot of hate for dumb reasons and I am inclined to believe that it's cause it's DC and Marvel fan boys are determined to see DC fail. The movie has a very simple plot and the villain's motivations are also very simple. But sometimes simplicity works best,case in point. Suicide Squad goes for a more humorous simple plot unlike the dark over-complicated DC film that preceded it. This is what I don't get, BvS was criticised for being humourless and over-complicated; this contains much more humour and a simple but good plot and is called childish and immature. The cast are all amazing with Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis an Jai Courtney being the stand outs for me. Without spoiling, Viola Davis kills it as the controlling, shady Amanda Waller which was fantastic. As previously mentioned there is a good amount of humour here and the jokes are very funny. It was amazing to see a few iconic comic book panels and covers be re-created here, and the brief cameos from Batman and another Justice Leaguer where amazing. My only gripe with the movie is that there isn't a whole lot of Joker, but I'd say he's in it as long as Spidey was in Civil War so it's six and two threes really. As for Jared Leto every scene he was in he stole and was amazing, although I still don't like the tattoos he is an amazing Joker and I can't wait to see him again (although Heat Ledger is still the definitive Joker). So just to wrap it up this is an amazing film and is perfect proof you shouldn't listen to critics, listen to fans who know these characters and know an amazing adaptation when we see one. I liked BvS but I'll admit it had it's problems, but this is a vast improvement, the DCEU is headed in the right direction. Ignore the critics go see this awesome movie!",Suicide Squad
1503,zntii_2,"The ""suicide"" squad",6,6 August 2016,"Basically this movie kills it self, most of the time is overloaded with characters, music and plot that never seems to have a proper balance, you get a lot of unnecessary scenes/characters and just a peak of interesting and profound ones. The charm of this movie resides heavily on the Joker and Harley, while Deadshot motivations and background are a good and solid complement. But on the other hand there are a lot of weak links starting with Katana which is unnecessary and has a horrendous personification ( basically your typical Asian stereotype) followed by Mr. Boomerang, the Crocman and the underwhelming presentation of enchantress, cut down this characters and you will have a better movie. It seems that DC is rushing and trying too hard the ""marvel model"" that at least this time presents a huge missed opportunity.",Suicide Squad
1504,ismsons-910-411623,actors were good..but plot was just sad,5,19 December 2016,I think the writer director copied stuff from some cheap animated movie...making a movie is easy but making a good movie that makes sense and justifies the plot is not. To learn the whole DC team should sit and start watching marvel movies ... this is no more the 1960s were audience would gasp at how the villains have buried the whole army to the ground but killed by a very regular tactical bomb and a katana sword.........there was no depth......when rescued the Lady Nick Fury of this movie kills other FBI agents??? the world is ending shes is surrounded by monsters but that's her priority? The joker looked like a stripper in a gay bar no offence.... and cheap cgi villains? DC people are so lazyyyyyy,Suicide Squad
1505,sideorderofflies1,Ruined by the fingerprints of studio interference and misogyny,1,4 August 2016,Warner Bros have clearly learnt overreacted to the critical backlash aimed at bvs. This film is a ghastly car crash of a movie. It feels like the studio drove a garish bus of frat boys into the dark sleek car of David Ayer's original vision. What could have been a darkly comic film has been turned into a overly silly nonsense fest complete with very obvious reshoot footage which shoe horns in some really really bad slices of what the studio thinks passes for humour. It is in short tonally all-over the place as is the pacing. That tone in the reshoot footage also stinks of misogyny especially when it comes to Harley Quinn. A character whom it would appear David Ayer's wanted to be shown as a deeply damaged and complex character is reduced to a overtly sexual object spouting one liners. Just awful.,Suicide Squad

1507,IsabelM11,Worse than Batman v. Superman,4,4 August 2016,"Trying to keep up with the plot of this movie is like chasing a moving train. Except even when you think you've caught up to it, you're not sure you want to get on board. As someone who went into this movie with tempered expectations thanks to negative critical reviews, yet also hope it would have some redeeming moments due to the overall positive IMDb user reviews, I can honestly say that the critics may have won on this one. Suicide Squad has a number of issues, but is not a total loss for comic book fans. The performances by the actors is not what stops this film from being a success, but it doesn't stop their characters from going in the wrong direction. 1. THE PLOT: The plot was pretty much a mess. This was a common complaint about the Batman V. Superman movie: the plot defied logic and had too much trivial sub-plot due to the amount of characters. Suicide Squad runs into a similar problem. I feel like they compensated logic to simply include scenes that would satisfy comic book fans, however it's at the sake of the film's success as a whole. Nothing is ever explained that you want explained. And somehow the movie is a confusing blend of predictable yet unclear. I found myself constantly asking ""Why wouldn't you just do____?"" 2. Not enough screen time for the other squad members: The rest of the squad (Other than Harley and Deadshot) are not fleshed out well. And the movie's feeble attempts to add background, dimension or complexity to the characters fails, with flashbacks and random monologues that don't elicit any sort of empathy from the viewer. I found myself easily not caring about the squad or its success at all. (Example in point 6)3. PACING: I think the attempts to flesh out the characters failed also because of the way the movie is paced. It's about 2 hours, yet feels like a 30 minute movie. Scenes jump around quickly and what they do choose to drag out (flashbacks amongst other things) may be fun to watch but is unnecessary. 3. Overuse of Music: A little more nit-picky, yet nonetheless something I noticed. Now I'm for every character having a cool theme, and soundtracks are great but... Suicide Squad utilizes loud, distracting, CONSTANT music... over dialogue, over key scenes.... music accompanies everything. Or at least that's what it felt like. Don't get me wrong sometimes it works. 4. THERE ARE NO STAKES INVOLVED WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING MONSTERS MADE OF GOOP: I worried about the antagonists of this movie when I saw the trailers. None of the fight scenes have any real tension or meaning, because of the type of monsters they're fighting. Faceless, CGI, magical goop. 5. Uneven Dynamic of Power: This is a big issue I have with the movie. A lot of the characters seem extremely unnecessary and frankly misplaced, due to the disparity of power between all of them. In Batman V. Superman, people worried about how Batman would stand next to Superman, Wonder Woman and Apocalypse. In Suicide Squad it just felt wrong that a girl with bat and a guy with a boomerang were even within two feet of a guy who can breathe fire and a woman who can tear a hole in the sky. You simply don't believe Harley, for example, is needed in the group, which throws the logic of the film out of wack. Or that her bat can rip apart monsters, when Waller's bullets don't pierce them or Katana's sword. Not sure if this is a popular opinion, but the thought definitely occurred to me. 6. Katana : Out of all the characters in this movie, Katana's character was the biggest wasted opportunity (Boomerang is a close runner up). I'm not too familiar with her character in the comics, but I've looked up a couple strips and she's speaking English. THEY FREAKING SUBTITLE HER IN THE MOVIE. She can't even communicate with the damn squad. She could have been a character that could bond with them and be pretty cool, but she's reduced to a non-English speaking, body guard. And the film's attempts to humanize her couldn't be more ineffective. I had hoped this character would be utilized stronger and better.7. The Joker : I never thought I'd say this in my lifetime, but this film should not have included the Joker. He should have full gotten his own movie or only been in certain scenes. Jared Leto does a great job, and he's definitely a scene stealer. In fact, I could see people leaving this movie thinking he was the best part or the only redeeming quality (Which in my mind is actually Will Smith), but I did enjoy watching the Joker. But his appearances made no sense in the context of the plot and felt fairly forced and random. I was expecting complex schemes from him or maybe an interesting sub plot, but that's not what I got from the movie.8. Still Fun to Watch : The movie with all its faults is nonetheless fun to watch at times and the performances aren't bad. There are particular moments that I think are done well or include nice cinematic details. Batman v. Superman is overall a better film, but Suicide Squad is definitely more exciting. In conclusion: It was difficult to keep this review fairly spoiler free, but I think I did it. Suicide Squad may become your next ""guilty pleasure bad movie"" film, but I think the average viewer will definitely find the film to be subpar. I did, and I hope this review helps you.",Suicide Squad
1508,Blackfudge,Good because of Harley Quinn,5,12 October 2019,"I tried to like this film as much as i could but the only thing that keeps me watching is that sweet/crazy Harley Quinn. She's just too good to ignore so i watch the whole film till the end. I believe this film lacks story, like why the hell bad guys would do or sacrifice to achieve something.

I didn't deem it necessary for the kids or myself to see such dark and sexually explicit, demonizing scripting. Certainly not a movie for kids under 13. My family loves action and adventure. Although this film surely included both, I refused to sit thru it with good conscious. We all wanted to get the full plot and see where it was going. I could not consent to the children seeing another minute of the film. Lap dancing, men and women kissing each other, to each his own, not for my family. Enough already. Not allowing such to be flaunted in the eyes of our kids when in my power. I realize the necessity of knowing who the characters were prior to recruitment to the squad. Sexually explicit scenes and profanity aren't necessary to make a top selling movie. I really believe the overall plot would have been great.

1512,pecisk,Entertainment with a bit of heart,8,3 August 2016,"First, I want to state that I respect people who do serious movie reviewing for a living. They are more of art scientists, follow how cinema as an art flows and turns and mostly they can do is just comment on sideways. However I was kinda 'duh' when reading RT reviews on Suicide Squad - luckily, I am bit of movie freak myself and had planned to see this movie anyway. And boy didn't I walk away confused did we even saw same movie. Because I loved it with all it's flaws.So if you don't want to twelve into details - yes, movie is fun, yes, most of SS characters are great, there are few misses but they are mostly script's fault who doesn't let them all breathe - although to be frank, to give them all justice this movie had to be 3 hours. BUT these small issues - along with tone and editing in places - doesn't destroy movie. It's bold, it tries to do something interesting with 'team of baddies' concept and almost flawlessly gets away with it. Definitely go see it at cinema to form your own opinion. Movie is not bore fest, and you can get descent entertainment out of it, even if you end up not particularly liking it.Mild spoilers ahead.Now, what's working and what's not - as I said, characters are done well. If anything, this movie is solid platform for them to grow and enrich any further movies DCU will have (and as most of them are from Batman side of town, you get idea). I am not completely sold on Letto's Joker yet, but I really won't trash him. He's a bit of pain an a ass in this movie, not villain. His screen time is way too short to judge. What I can say though I felt uneasy, his movements hid dangers. Everyone else is doing their part and I bought their performances - yes, even Croc, Boomerang and Flag. Standouts are very good Will Smith as Deadshot, positively crazy Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo. Original music was a bit mixed bag (I personally think in some places mix was a bit overboard), but soundtrack is excellent one and will stay with you. Visually movie stays true to trailers and I personally liked that flavor.Overall it is worth movie to see to make up your mind. I kinda disagree with harshness movie received at Rotten Tomatoes. It's certainly more alive than BvS, and characters there are more fleshed out and more reliable. It's not ten hit, but it's not colossal miss neither. 8 out of 10.",Suicide Squad

I think there won't be another good joker after heath ledger.i think we all have a doubt when we saw in the trailers how he looks like and all the stupid accessories he wears but we waited to see his performance he had little screen times but still it didn't have any impact on us it's like he is acting crazy you can't really feel or believe it . adding batman was a great choice but i waited all the movie for his appearance again but all the screen times he had was in the trailers!

1515,balde01,A lame attempt,6,6 September 2016,"The creators obviously tried to add some color and humor to the gloomy DC film universe, but the result is confusing. They reduced Nolan's pathos but there is still not much humor or authentic drama. The actors seems to have had much fun, a little bit of quarrels - in the end they got their money fee, and the audience got funny, but absolutely useless piece which personally I won't watch for the second time..In my view, Squad's obvious problem it is the script. In the beginning, we are quickly introduce us to the main characters in a completely disproportional way. Then a long and meaningless campaign without a single memorable action scene. What a waste Of money, time, characters. David Eyre couldn't cope with the blockbuster, so it is better for him to get back to the low-budget films. Villains are charismatic and funny to follow but their mission frustrates – it's not as suicidal as it should be. They are sometimes too good. You even forget that they are bad guys.",Suicide Squad
1516,akrim55,The Joker and Harley Quinn shine in this otherwise average movie.,7,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was a very average, border line below average, take on the new ""Super Team"" fad that has been going around Hollywood. The action wasn't anything special and there was plenty of cheesy superhero moments (i.e. Diablo's line ""I already lost one family, I'm not losing another!""). Most members of the Suicide Squad are just down right uninteresting. Save for Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn and Will Smith's Deadshot. Although Deadshot turned out to be a cliché, it was still a good performance by Will Smith and by no means boring to watch. However this movie truly shines when The Joker, played by Jared Leto, and Harley Quinn are on screen. Especially when the two of them are on screen together. The two characters have an absolutely insane relationship and feed off of each other's craziness/creepiness making them a blast to watch on screen together. The only problem is there's not enough of that in this movie. I realize that this movie isn't solely focused on those two, but it should be. They are by far the most entertaining part of this movie and really carry this other wise unremarkable movie. If you are expecting a Heath Ledger type of Joker then you will be disappointed. Where as Ledger's Joker is more of an anarchist who wants to cause chaos in the criminal underworld, Leto's Joker dominates it. This version of the Joker is a very accomplished criminal and basically an underworld kingpin. But yet he still manages to maintain just the right amount of insanity in every scene he's in. Another problem with this movie is the director and writers seem to have forgotten that the members of the Suicide Squad are supposed to be bad guys. None of them really feel like villains. My only gripe with Harley Quinn was she wasn't as ruthless as she should have been, especially when compared to the Joker. As far as setting up more events in the DC universe, this movie pretty much does what you expect. Overall if you really wanted to see this movie, I still would, but if your'e on the fence maybe wait for a cheap showing or rental.",Suicide Squad

But what are they without super villains? *SPOILERS AHEAD*The prime super-villain, Enchantress and her machine-god-like bro, is way too comic-al. Yes, pun intended. But why does the sis-bro duo want world domination? Unclear. And the loony bin turns upside down as Amanda Waller begins recruiting. She plays one go-getter, twisted character, someone whom you'd not want to be pally with/mess with in real life.Splash of neons like a breath of fresh air, a cheer leader with a baseball bat, waddling her cute pigtails and twinkling eyes, and a combo of minxy madness and toxicity, Harley Quinn is played by Margot Robbie. You want to live her idiosyncrasies, you want to jump in joy and sink into despair, and fall in love with a madman, her Puddin', her Joker  just because. She wisecracks, she shows off her inner child, yet she's confident with her sexuality. ""This is just a whole lotta' pretty and a whole lotta' crazy,"" as they say about her. Whole lotta' love for her, I say!Jared Leto's Joker has no character development and appears sporadically like all guest appearances go. Barring the scenes where he's lying on the floor surrounded by knives – in all sorts of varieties, or where he plunges down after Harley Quinn into a pool of gooey, toxic stuff. The metal teeth, the method acting and the tattoos don't help. I can scream Heath Ledger's name out aloud and state that he was, to me, the creepiest Joker ever. Think Jim Carey or Jack Nicholson – way better. Sorry Leto, you were a letdown.Will Smith's Deadshot plays it cool, funny, quirky, wherever necessary and as you guessed, as expected. He almost appears like a vamped up version of the dad from 'Pursuit of Happiness'. The other villains are Diablo with his pyrokinetic powers and a tragic backstory, the super angry Killer Croc, a clichéd Captain Boomerang, and the sword- swinger Katana – so hugely underdeveloped a character, and almost a sorry sight.What's good, sorry, great? The brilliant soundtrack which takes you back to your childhood – Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, Without Me by Eminem, Sympathy for the Devil by The Rolling Stones, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap by AC/DC – and to pep it up there's 'Purple Lamborghini' by Skrillex and 'Sucker for Pain' by Wiz Khalifa, Imagine Dragons and Li'l Wayne. Yes, give it a listen. I bet you'll fall for it.A film that acts like a filler between 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' and JLA, what else is there to say?

Capt Boomerang and the enchantress failed to impress. Also at times the story line seemed quite stretched and over-reliant on stories of two characters- Smith and Margot. The way the climax unraveled, and how the enchantress got unleashed, was uninspiring. Fight sequences and graphics were nothing extraordinary. Scenes like the one in bar serve just for movie promotions, and in no ways contributes to plot development.Overall, a one time watch, and but for Margot and Smith, I could have rated it a 5.",Suicide Squad

Brief backgrounds of characters, excellent action scene's and Margo's Harley Quinn was perfect and funny. Some of the poor reviews show how many 'critics' have no true understanding of genre movies.I am 50 years old and have been going to the cinema/theater since i was 11 years old. I have over 300 movies in my personal collection. It is a movie for DC comic fans and I can see what the director did here, general movie goers because of general movie formats probably wont like it. Im glad the movie played to 'die hard'comic fans because movies that try to do both, fail miserably. If the movie is so bad, how is it making good money at the box office?I am not easily convinced or entertained with movies and I have walked out of some, the 1999 Inspector Gadget movie for instance. I give this movie an 8/10, would have been a 9, only because it could have had another 30mins of possible background or plot development and more 'Joker' time.

The rest of them are not even worth analyzing. Then you have the witch, which was the worst of the bad, seems to me that Cara is talent-less for acting, worst if it's suppose to be a obscure and ancient villain.The only reason for not giving a 1 out of 10 is Harley Quinn. Margot is insanely hot! and she indeed seemed crazy as supposed to be for her character, she definitely is the spark that lights up the movie.",Suicide Squad

Or an enjoyable movie. After hearing great reviews from everyone I had asked, the expectations were fairly high. Let's just say I was lucky I had a Choc Top. First of all the introduction dragged on for 60 minutes before any kind of story line evolved. Learning about the characters was probably the most entertaining part of the movie actually.Oh my lord and the cast.. Cara Delevingne who played the 'all powerful; Enchantress' could not have been less powerful looking. Her little dance moves were confusing and off putting. Cara's piercing eyebrows didn't quite cut it this time sorry. Margot Robbie, Harley Quinn; I mean, sure if they wanted someone to look good with no pants on they nailed that. But she didn't do anything more than strut around with a base ball bat wearing panties and a terrible Boston accent. Jarad Leto, the Joker; didn't have his scars. Was he really the Joker? Captain Boomerang, Crocodile Dundee, embarrasses Australia successfully. About as successful as the Boston accent. Will Smith. He's Will Smith, he did as good as he could with what he was given.5/10 but that's because I was feeling generous.",Suicide Squad
1523,mitchellwelch-36896,Yikes! weaksauce...,3,10 August 2016,"I wanted to like this film.. clearly retarded motivations works for the cast of It's Always Sunny in Philly (we need welfare money, time to smoke crack)..but here, no logic.I cringe at the generic villain of this film.. Flag, the team's babysitter. Has a babysitter for himself in Katana, which I kind of tossed in with the other SS members even though she traps souls in her sword which is a little too cool to dismiss so easily, but anywho.. Flag in a relationship with Enchantress' vessel June, was introduced at the time we were populating the squad with blocks of cheese as anti-heroes. So at the same time the SS was being assembled, the villain of our movie was farmed in house by Waller, This was sooooo lazy...soooo confusing.. I thought Enchantress was gonna be a team member because of the love for Flag.. the villain of this movie was farmed from the same boardroom meeting that was to green light the squad's members.WTF. I know, you could have spent those brain cells you just lost on something productive like taking drugs, but no.moving on.. I only liked El Diablo, as it was the only anti-hero that seemed like a human being you may know. His powers came with a terrible price, so his reluctance seemed like the only proper writing in the entire movie. That, and he could BBQ everything in the movie if he wanted which would destroy the need for a team to begin with.The Joker was not menacing, Jared Leto made him cartoon-ish and entirely laughable. Colorful, but even when him & Harley kill Common's character..the taste of WTF in my mouth was never far. I remember Joker being annoyed by Harley, she was the Joker's tool-bag assistant. Why all the romance? the producers playing Chuck Woolry or something??? they want Jared & Margot to hook up like the stars of Mr. & Mrs. Smith??? I dunno..WTF. just wanted Joker to be as I love him (even though I'm a marvel & Image guy) intensely homicidal in his psychosis. insta-ultra-violent clown, what is so hard to understand about that?!I just get the impression that I, a mortal, solo, could snatch the life out of every one of these characters like I was ordering a pizza delivered.. well, all of em' except El Diablo.Have plenty of respect for Ben Affleck's skills, but he looks like a hoe-cake in the Bat costume, this confuses me. No batman for me, for like a decade I guess. Perhaps it was his fight sequence with Jenn Garner's Electra in Daredevil, If it was a real world fight... I would have put twenty beanz on Jenn via KO in the 3rd. (/sigh)Evan Peter's Quicksilver sequences in both of the X-Men films he was in, are just waaaaaaaaay tighter and more entertaining than Suicide Squad was as a whole. Will Smith is still cooler than the other side of the pillow, but he couldn't save this tripe. There simply isn't any actual story telling going on with this film.Watch Ant-man again instead. A complete film with origin perfectly paced throughout the story. With Suicide Squad there can be no sequel.. only reboot.",Suicide Squad

You can not blame David Ayer, assuming he only got 7 weeks from Warner Bros. To create the script. The script is actually ""good"" to be written in 7 weeks.

So every time you wanted to get out from your seat, the story line will be telling, no hold down we still got some stuffs to show you.Joker was not impressive enough apart from his deadly laugh.

It was also very confusing at times what the whole point is and also it had many unnecessary side roles that were there to try to make it funny. There was nothing new or original about the movie.. it looked more like a poor sci-fy comedy than a serious super hero movie. It's more like a movie with a low intelligence humor; i would not recommend it to under 16 y. old audience because of foul language but also not for over 17+ thinking audience because low intelligence humor and poor story.

1531,afutoma,Truly Amazing - Joker and Harley Are the BEST,9,17 August 2016,"I went to the movie with my partner quite skeptical due to the lousy critical reviews it had received since its release. However, I was pleasantly and maniacally surprised with a pretty amazing movie that was directed pretty nicely. Most of the characters and story lines were basically taken from the comics themselves which was nice to see for a change. Leto's Joker and Robbie's Harley clicked perfectly with one another and left me and my partner pretty entertained throughout the movie. The Joker was used mostly to keep the story moving along and that was one of the things which bothered me the most with the other being how much screen time Deadshot received. Most of Joker's scenes were cut especially the ones that were shown in previews which irks me somewhat and makes me feel like the film used slightly false advertising to draw audiences in more. Deadshot got way too much screen time and seemed to have a better costume/makeup job than everyone else which also irks me because the movie is not even about Deadshot and his story at all. Overall though it was a pretty good movie.",Suicide Squad
1532,izzyscadeng,A Totally Honest Review: a few too many mistakes but otherwise hugely enjoyable film,7,22 August 2016,"Let me begin by stating that I hugely enjoyed this film. Sure, it's no cinematic masterpiece that will walk away with Best Picture come February, and there are some serious inconsistencies and let-down littered throughout the movie, but I want to set the record straight as I feel as though Suicide Squad has unjustly come under fire among critics. What I am about to write is my opinion and only that.From the first trailer I saw for this film I jumped on the hype train, which may have led some, myself included, to feel slightly underwhelmed while watching the final product. There were around 4 official trailers released, as well as shorter ones focusing on individual characters. This was a mistake as it gave away many of the movie's best bits, to the extent that when watching the movie it almost felt like an extended version of one of these many trailers. This leads into the next mistake: the trailers gave the impression that the main villain would be the Joker, which sadly was not the case. While I commend Warner Bros for not revealing the baddie before the movie's release, I do feel that the excessive presence of the Joker in the trailers was misleading, especially when the character only appeared in total for about 10-15 mins. Jared Leto's interpretation of one of cinema's most recognisable bad guys has also had mixed opinions. Personally I thought he was one of if not the highlight of the movie, bringing a charisma and prowess I feel was lacking in earlier interpretations. Nevertheless Leto's limited screen-time was a grave error on behalf of the editing team. Leto himself in an interview stated regretfully that many more scenes featuring him had been filmed, but were cut from the theatrical release. I can only hope Suicide Squad takes a leaf out of Batman vs. Superman's book and releases a DVD ultimate edition with these scenes included.I found, more frequently than should be forgiven, that the movie's editing affected – and at times hindered – the pace. For example the bar scene: it felt awkwardly placed, clearly someone was desperate to squeeze a bar scene in there somewhere and the result added little to the overall plot. The same can be said for Enchantress (Cara Delevigne) who's motivations throughout the movie were never made quite clear, besides the whole 'I wanna destroy the world because I can' attitude. If the film had taken more time to establish who Dr June Moone was and her relationship with Rick Flagg, maybe I would have cared about her character even a little. That being said, although being the main villain, Enchantress features relatively little too. Rather, the main conflict centres on the squad themselves and their ability to group together and put their differences aside. Here is where the film excelled for me. The chemistry between Smith and Robbie's Deadshot and Harley Quinn was excellent and fun to watch. These two, and possibly El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) carried the movie, rendering the rest of the cast to being their back-up dancers. Harley was by far the most intriguing, her backstory interlaced with that of the Joker in a relationship many fans were dying to see on screen, and were not disappointed. On a separate note the music was great! A perfect mix of original score and soundtrack that was well-suited to each scenario.From the comments I've given my rating of 7/10 may seem too generous (I'm looking at you Rotten Tomatoes), but thinking back to how I felt whilst watching I enjoyed Suicide Squad far more than many films released in the last year. It left me wanting to see more of these characters and wanting to watch it again, which can only be a good thing. So why so much hate? Perhaps some people think it's cool to hate on summer blockbusters, perhaps some thought this film was too violent (yet I don't recall seeing any blood?) and that is their opinion. Let other people decide their own.",Suicide Squad
1533,bennowell,Lucky I didn't watch it in the Cinema,2,1 January 2017,"It is very simple what I can describe this film and I quote ""You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado"". Jared Leto's Joker and the combination of Will Smith and Margot Robbie's ASS are the only good things going for this film. Now the negatives: the overuse of music, the death of one of the squad (Who was doing all the press conference's and he died within like 10mins of appearing), no investment into the characters in that I didn't care when someone died and the plain/bland storyline that an infant could have written (If you count an infant crapping in its hands and telling how it came out). Truly terrible.",Suicide Squad
1534,Ghost5379,A Fun Disappointing Mess,6,7 August 2016,"Anyone who thinks this movie is excellent is either a kid or someone who doesn't know anything about movies.Let's start with the good things. The first act is very entertaining and promising. It begins with Amanda Waller talking about the Suicide Squad, their backstories and how they caught them. It might seem like lazy writing but it doesn't matter because of the good and entertaining execution. The best things about this film are the characters and the performances. Viola Davis is great, she really pulls off the scary, mean lady type. Will Smith is awesome as Deadshot, he was really cool and funny and he has a really good backstory involving his daughter, that you actually care about, and probably has the best action scene in the movie where he's on top of a car. He has very good chemistry with Harley Quinn and a very entertaining and developing relationship with Rick Flag, who was very good as well. Margot Robbie is also really good as Harley Quinn, she's funny but crazy, and like Deadshot her backstory is explored the most through flashbacks. Which brings me to Jared Leto as the Joker. I was really hyped for him and I wanted to see what he can do, but there's really nothing to say because the Joker is only in ten minutes of this movie. And the scenes that he's in are not scenes, there just moments of him mostly through flashbacks, and every one of them was shown in the trailer so you think he's going to be an important part of the movie and also the villain, which he is not, he's actually only in the movie for Harley and the other moments of him don't have anything to do with the rest of the movie or the plot. And those moments don't slow down so the Joker doesn't have any scenes where you can examine Leto's performance. And that was really disappointing. Which brings me to the fact that this movie is poorly edited and you just know that a lot of it was cut out. The scene where Joker is going to torture Harley Quinn is all in just a flashback full of cuts.The second and third act of this movie are just random and not memorable action scenes , in this city, between some scenes of dialogue and funny moments, which sometimes work and sometimes do not. Even though I have to admit that this movie was funny and I did laugh a lot.Some of the characters are completely wasted like Katana, Killer Croc and Slipknot who wasn't even shown a backstory and who dies in the first two minutes. The biggest problems of this movie are the plot and the villain. The villain is Enchantress who is this evil witch who wants to take over the world and shots a big beam in the sky to open portals or something. She also has a brother who's this big CGI monster who I don't care about enough to remember his name, by the way the CGI is actually very bad and it just looks ridiculous. So its a completely cliché villain plot with a cliché ending where they defeat the big magical monster by throwing a bomb at the middle of the beam and it explodes and everything is fine now. And we think June Moone is dead so it's a sad moment, but guess what, she's alive and were all happy now. A similar scene is where the Joker's helicopter crashes and Harley's sad because she thinks he's dead and it's supposed to be a sad moment but it isn't because we all know the Joker's not dead.And the last thing about this movie. Jai Courtney is surprisingly pretty good as Captain Boomerang, he's funny and enjoyable but his character is completely useless. And it makes you think, why would they sent a crazy girl with a bat, a guy who shoots people, a girl with a sword and a guy with a boomerang to go fight this magical creature. The only one who's actually useful and can do some damage is Diablo who's actually a really cool character.In the end, the movie was funny and entertaining, the characters were good, but the plot/story, the editing and the villain were trash.I liked Batman v Superman but I definitely don't love this movie. I give it a 6.5/10",Suicide Squad
1535,YukariTakeba,DC'S saving grace,6,6 August 2016,"Suicide Squad wasn't a film that was particularly on my radar, I intended on seeing the film solely to see Jared Leto's portrayal of the Joker and Harley Quinn's cinematic debut. From a critical perspective, David Ayer's entry into the DCEU isn't very well made. The fact that he supposedly wrote the script in only six weeks may explain why there are glaring plot holes, weak characterization and a dull finale. What does work however is the chemistry between the cast and the enjoyment factor of the film, and that's where Suicide Squad shines and the general audience will likely get a kick out of the film as they did with Guardians of the Galaxy given that the two have the same vibe. The standout performances are Viola Davis' as Amanda Waller who just fits the character perfectly and is essentially ripped from her comic book incarnation. Will Smith as Deadshot is basically Will Smith which isn't necessarily a bad thing, besides Harley he had the most development out of the Squad and is more of a anti- hero than full on villain. Lastly Margot Robbie gives a decent performance, while it takes a while to get used to her interpretation of the character, it grows on you during the film and she has a couple of good lines and she has great chemistry with Jared Leto's Joker for the short time we see the two together. The villain (Enchantress) is sadly very underwhelming and fills out of place, her and her brother (who isn't even given a name) hardly do anything of relevance in the film. Her minions are basically zombies and seeing the Squad fight and shoot through them isn't very interesting and the final fight feels very anti climatic and oddly enough is sorta a rip off of the original Ghostbusters finale. Overall Suicide Squad is an enjoyable film with a few great performances and lines. After the mixed reception MoS and BvS garnered for their tone and treatment of beloved characters, this is a breath of fresh air for those who want something different from the DCEU and as long as you aren't expecting an Oscar worthy script or the most original plot you should be fairly pleased.",Suicide Squad
1536,Bryce_Carmony,Aggressively bad and painfully stupid,3,13 February 2020,Suicide Squad is a wasted opportunity. The premise of villains being pressed into service to do the dirty work heroes can't or won't perform is interesting and worth exploring unfortunately this film rejects that and just makes an incoherent mess.The threat in the film is not morally dubious and superheroes would be fully within their jurisdiction to address it. Just a miserable film and a swing and a miss.,Suicide Squad

1538,deeptibakshi,back after birds of prey,6,11 February 2020,"Honestly just came back here to say that I stand by my 6/10 rating. But I wanted to add that I think it's still better than Birds of Prey. I don't understand people saying that regardless of what they think of BoP, ""at least it's better than Suicide Squad"". I rewatched SS today just to figure out how I felt and I can genuinely say this was the better film. Not that that's a very high bar though..This movie is really below average at best. The plot doesn't have a good enough structure or a solid foundation but it's a fun enough film to watch if you are bored and wanna kill time. Its watchable, basically.Margot as Harley was probably the main highlight. The formation of the team itself was believable enough but they could use some more development on screen before I accept them as a properly established squad. The cast did a good job overall and I liked pretty much all the characters, even though some of them weren't highlighted too much. Like they're the kind of characters you'd wanna root for.El Diablo's death was sad and a typical cheesy sacrifice type moment. However, while I DO feel for the character, his death wasn't particularly moving? I feel like we didn't get to know the character enough to really mourn his loss. We knew his tragic backstory but outside of that we didn't connect much with the character itself so I got over his death by the following scene honestly. But I did feel that the characters themselves felt a true loss in his death which adds to the fact that this plot, although sloppy, does lead you to believe that the team has been formed well enough, it wasn't forced.The soundtrack was cool but some of the music ques were so randomly placed and that could have been done in a better way.I also personally believe Jared's Joker received too much flack for this. I liked his performance and think he did a good job. He's no Ledger or Phoenix but his portrayal doesn't deserve the poor treatment its given. Not too mention this is barely enough footage of him to go on to blatantly hate on the portrayal. People should have given it more of a chance in my opinion.",Suicide Squad

1540,mrspadrona,"Matinée worthy, not date worthy",4,5 August 2016,"I really wanted to like this movie because I'm a fan of the ""summer blockbuster"" genre. Never having read the comics, I was aware of the characters simply because of their impact on pop culture but not the minute details that a fan of the comics would be. I guess I'm the target audience age wise, being in my early 40s and having grown up with Harley Quinn/Mr. J/Batman animated series. The plot is good in concept but junky in execution. It jumps and never really seems to become a cohesive story-line. So many characters are there that it's hard to really latch onto them as individual pieces and you just have to accept they are there. Grossly underdeveloped and becoming caricatures of even themselves, the movie never really draws you in ... most glaring example of this is Harley Quinn. She is less ""free spirit"" and more ""doll with her strings cut"". All in all, it was worth the price of popcorn but I don't know that it would be a group or a date movie. It never really draws you in, never holds your attention and plunks along for 2.5 hours. Wait for it to stream somewhere ...",Suicide Squad
1541,gabeeaster,Stunning Visuals Cannot Atone for Lackluster Storyline and Plot Holes Galore,5,7 August 2016,"Before reading this, know that I was incredibly hyped to see this and am a completely unbiased lover of both DC/Marvel and I won't be making any comparisons to the latter as that's completely unnecessary. This was a movie I was more excited to see than I was even BvS or Civil War. That says a lot for the marketing of the film.Let me start by saying that the only characters I ended up actually caring about were Harley Quinn and Deadshot. The origins were a convoluted mess of cut scenes and probably would've better played out in order than an array of flashbacks. I put aside the poor editing as everything was still contained but from the flashbacks I now wish that they would've done an origin movie on either or both Harley and how she and the Joker fell in love, or Deadshot and how he came to become the hit-man for hire before ultimately being captured by Batman. The rest of the squad honestly can be surmised relatively quickly in flashbacks and that's fine.That aside, the movie starts off well but quickly begins to decline as the introduction of all these characters begins to drag. One error I noted immediately was how neither Slipknot nor Katana were mentioned in the briefing at the beginning and, if we're being true to reality, they should've been, but somehow they just...show up. Perhaps that was part of the re-shoots so I'll assume their inclusion was something added later on. So what right?Plot holes all begin with Enchantress and whatever the heck that ""machine"" is that she's building, which is basically just a lightning bolt with debris and crushed cars rotating around it, which conveniently takes the entire amount of time for the Suicide Squad to A) reach Waller and B) reach her. If Enchantress could teleport everywhere in a flash, such as when she retrieved that ""impossible to get"" book of military strategies, why didn't she just teleport to Waller, grab her with her newfound power granted her via her brother, and then just plug her into said ""machine"" for info and then just teleport to each of these places and lay bombs and blow them all simultaneously? Maybe that's stretching the realm of possibility but I don't think it would've taken her as long as it did to build said machine, etc.Next plot hole, if Waller was going to call a chopper...why did she need the squad to come retrieve her? That part made absolutely no sense. Why didn't Waller have the other clay doll containing Enchantress's brother locked away in the same box instead of, idk, in the top of her closet?! The bar scene was atrociously lame. Somehow, we went from drinking and realizing the world's going to end to hearing Diablo's sob story of how he killed his wife and kids. It was endearingly heartbreaking moment for his character but the lead-in was weirdly played out. Then we turn to Harley, whom I've never so much as thought to have a serious moment save for before when she was a psychiatrist, suddenly tell him to ""own that sh*t."" It fell very oddly upon my ears and came across more cheesy than anything.The cheesy lines don't end there. Being from the south and hearing Flagg, I kept wondering what exact region in the south he was supposed to be from? Accents aside, Flagg had his fair share of cheesy dialogue, but perhaps cheesier and more unexplainable was how Diablo, after only a few hours with this group, suddenly considers them family. Enchantress says things like ""You don't have the balls!"" which is a bit weird coming from an ancient all powerful god-like witch.More plot holes: how the heck is a God defeated by a bomb? And how did they know that that would work when Diablo already has his fiery hand, not only inside his chest, but actually burning his face, wasn't stopping him? How is he not immortal when Katana chops off his hand and it grows back but somehow a bomb takes him out? It didn't add up. The machine Enchantress created is somehow stopped by a pack of stick dynamite ignited by Deadshot? Why didn't she teleport and grab the pack? How did Harley know to throw a gun to Deadshot when he screamed her name? Was Killer Croc's only purpose to throw said bag of dynamite when Flagg easily could've done the same? What purpose did Captain Boomerang even serve? He seemed all but expendable in the grand scheme of things. At least Deadshot can replace half of Flagg's army.I feel I have to see more of Leto's Joker to really formulate a true opinion of him but I liked him from what I saw. I think Ledger's Joker is a better approach on a more sociopathic Joker but Leto's could be truer to the psychotic, crazy, and fun side of Joker. I need more. Batman appearing in the film was pretty awesome. Affleck has given a very true to comic version of the Dark Knight and I couldn't be happier with his performance. I really want to see more scenes between his Batman and Leto's Joker. The ending and the mid- credits scenes were great.It wasn't the worst film in the world, but there are just so many unanswered questions and the fact is, it had so much potential to be BETTER. It came across very sloppy and jumbled but Deadshot and Harley were very fun to watch and actually made me miss Saturday morning cartoons. I do hope DC gets on track and starts making coherent films that flow better. This was the most fun out of the DCEU thus far for sure, but please just take care of the little things and get this train moving. I don't want this to be a preview of what we have to look forward to from Justice League.",Suicide Squad
1542,simonbruh,Will go down as one of the most underrated films in the history of cinema!,9,6 August 2016,"I was honestly baffled at how low some of these reviews have been. ""the characters weren't given enough backstory"" Um, ARE YOU INSANE?! The characters that needed build(Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Rick Flag and the Enchantress) got just that: build! I bet you'd still call the movie bad for ""giving too many characters unnecessary backstories"" had they went in the direction of giving detailed backstories to the likes of Killer Croc, Katana and Slipknot. ""The Joker was barely in it"" The movie is called ""Suicide Squad"" NOT ""The Joker"" alright? And, from the short time that Jared Leto's Joker was in the movie, he knocked it out of the park! ""The editing was choppy"" Now, I will admit, some of the editing in the first 20-25 minutes was kind of all over the place. But beyond that, there were little problems with the editing! ""There was too much music"" I feel like music doesn't hinder my viewing experience even if it's hammered into the movie, as long as the movie's soundtrack is enjoyable. And guess what! The soundtrack to Suicide Squad is GREAT! That's not even talking about the many, MANY laugh out loud moments, GREAT performances from all characters, main and supporting(yes, that includes MOST of the villains performance), the great action scenes, and the multiple emotional moments that had me tearing up multiple times during the movie! The cinema that I saw this movie in applauded multiple times during this movie, and I could see why. The only problems I had were the previously mentioned shoddy editing in the first 20 minutes, and the villain being kind of meh. Besides those reasons, Suicide Squad is one of my favorite comic book movies, and definitely up there with the likes of Deadpool, Civil War and The Nice Guys as one of my favorite movies of the year! Final verdict: 4.75/5 (or 9/10)",Suicide Squad
1543,babewosental,Didn't like This movie,2,5 August 2016,"I rely wanted to like this movie, but well ,this movie was slow. This movie had a pretty good cast, yes, but no too good dialogues. Yes, its true this movie is slow too. Now this movie may be for some, not me though. This movie rely bored me at times, though this movie was also confusing at times. So overall I'd give this movie a 1 or 2. This movie may be disappointing to DC fans, and if you've seen this movie, you no what I mean.Overall I'd say this movie was OK but not great. I wouldn't say go see-- whoops! I almost made a mistake and said the name of this movie! And as well know, thats against the rules. So up to you if you want to take a chance on this movie, I think this movie could of been better. See this movie and make up your own mind if you like this movie.",Suicide Squad

1545,alex-06662,Such a Disappointment,3,6 August 2016,"Comic book movies this year have been very hit and miss and while Marvel and Fox delivered solid movies if not groundbreaking DC and WB have for the second fallen well below the standard expected. I had such high expectations and a lot anticipation following such a pitch perfect marketing campaign. So when I went in to view the film on Friday night I was devastated to find that this movie was a big old messQuick Pros:1. Viola Davis.2. The team chemistry overall.Cons:1. The flow and editing of the film shocked me. It felt so jarring sitting watching this film as it constantly jumped and jerked around in short bursts. It felt like there were no extended or even normal length scenes just short bits of film stuck together as they tried to piece together a film. 2. The soundtrack was tiring and intrusive especially at the beginning of the film. At the beginning of the film we are given short introductions to each character and rather than dialogue each character is given a pop song that 'describes' them played over images of them almost video game style. For me got in the way of the film and a better script would negated the need for this.3. Speaking of the characters I was disappointed with the treatment of Harley Quinn and The Joker. As two of my favourite DC characters I was excited to see them portrayed here and while i can accept a new take on the characters I was not pleased with these iterations. Throughout the film they act like teenagers in puppy love and each of their personalities is simply defined by the other. I also don't feel enough justice was down to their origin story, or their origin scene to be frank. Harley goes from respected doctor to insane fan girl in literally 30 seconds with no real explanation. My biggest issue however stems from the premonition the villain gives to Harley which is supposed to show her ultimate fantasy and dream. In this dream she pictures herself as a stay at home wife in curlers with two kids kissing a non joker Jared Leto off to work. While I have no issue with women wanting to be a stay at home wife, it is every women decision as to what path they wasn't to follow, never has Harley Quinn in any publication or iteration I am aware of wanted to be 'normal'. She mocks 'normal' herself in the film!!! Harley and The Joker are both unapologetic in their craziness and they are in love with each others craziness. This was a huge insult to the character in my opinion.4. The film lacked a cohesive story. It seemed almost as though the script was written as they went and they almost had no idea how it was going to finish when they started filming. Obviously this isn't true Ayer wrote in in just sic weeks and honestly, it shows. It is simply a film about getting from point A to point B and even in this simple task they leave huge plot-holes and question marks. 5. Although I said I liked the team chemistry, which I do, I didn't not like the development of the team. I'll give a little break down of some character below but the team to me didn't make sense. Waller says she wants a team of meta-humans to fight for her as the 'next war will be fought with them' but out of her team only two are meta humans, the other are just skilled criminals and even then some aren't that skilled.Harley Quinn - She is fun in the film but not funny as Margot Robbie constantly tried to make her. None of the actors can improvise so please write their jokes next time. thanks.Deadshot - Typical Will Smith character bad guy with a heart of gold. Boring predictable and again like Harley not a meta-human who will win you wars.Killer Croc - One of two actual meta-humans and to be fair he delivered the only funny line in the film.Diablo - The most powerful of the team and the only one deserving member.My biggest problem with the team however was that we did not get the 'bad guys' we were promised. Each character has to remind us that they are a team of criminals as they act nothing like the most dangerous criminals in the World. A typical example is Deadshots refusal to kill Harley Quinn after Waller offers him what he wants. After developing the relationship between him and his daughter, they only relationship that gets that luxury, if he truly was a bad guy it would have been a very different film. (They tried to play this off with him claiming not kill women or children but it falls flat.)6. If you think Marvel has bad villains the Enchantress in this film makes even Thanos seem like a Loki. Cara Delevigne works out with an invisible hula hoop throughout her laboured performance showing that if you are going to hire a model for a super hero film, follow Bryan Singers lead and don't give her any lines. Despite her acting her characters motive are even worse. We are told she abilities beyond anything we know yet spends the entire film building a weapon that she only completes just as the team finally reach her then rather than use her 'amazing' powers she decides to engage in a knife fight with the team. This in itself was just o ludicrous that I couldn't help laugh out loud at such sloppy writing.7. The biggest flaw in my opinion is that this film fails completely to move the DCEU move forward at all.If anyone can save this sinking ship it most definitely is Wonder Woman.",Suicide Squad
1546,jakeunbound,"One mess of a movie, but it's somewhat entertaining.",5,16 August 2016,"What can I say that hasn't been said by others critical of this movie?I have read a few of the Suicide Squad comics and know many of the characters, I feel like they focuses too much on Deadshot (note that they made him more of family man who cares very dearly of his daughter instead of being the cold assassin that he is) and Harley Quinn (They have the longest back stories). Diablo was nice, but predictable until his death at the end, Captain Boomerang seemed useless most of the time, Killer Croc was okay from what we've seen, Amanda Waller is the cold and determined woman that I expected. I'm okay with Rick Flagg, but Katana, Enchantress, the Joker, and Slipknot are the characters who were done wrong.While every other villain on the squad has a back story, they skip Slipknot and kill him for trying to escape along with Captain Boomerang, and his death doesn't really have that big of an effect. Katana's problem comes from the fact that she can speak English in the comic, but only speaks Japanese here. I mean how can she effectively communicate with the team if she only speaks Japanese? AND she obviously understand them speaking English to her as well. Every fan knows they were falsely advertised for having The Joker in the movie (can't say too much about him since he was in for about 10 minutes) even though he wasn't even a major part of the movie even though he was advertised. Enchantress in the movie has really no reason to be a villain. They basically take her and use her for her abilities until she manages to brake free of Amanda Waller's hold and decides to turn on mankind for ""Not worshiping her and worshiping technology instead"" and conveniently finds her brother in the city as a normal person going to work and awakens him to make a weapon that was never explained what it will do. Her motivation makes no sense and should have been written better.The plot, editing, and humor are bad at times. I mean Amanda Waller wants to assemble a team using bad guys because Superman is dead and to fight any kind of meta-human threat, and inject a bomb with the power of a hand grenade in them for cooperation. That part is understandable and based off the comic. The scenes seem to jump from one place to another which throws off the pacing, also, the constant action to brief scene to action doesn't work all the time and seems out of place. After the second fight the squad chose to quit and get a drink and only came to finish the job because Deadshot said so, I mean why would the rest do it? Outside of Deadshot and Killer Croc, everyone with abilities doesn't seem to use them much (save Diablo during the later half of fight scenes because he refused to use them). Also Batman, and the Joker seemed unnecessary and didn't really add anything to the muddled plot. The humor was another problem, it seems like they tried to mix the dark and grittiness of Suicide Squad with light- heartedness and humor and it didn't work much. It often feels misplace, unfunny, and just unnecessary. Often the humor will ruin the scene and even action.Also, I heard there was so major Studio Interference from Hollywood Reporter, it's it true that could explain many of the problems and how it seems rushed, badly edited, and explanation of the humor and light-heart tone put in.I'd rank as average at best, but somewhat better than Batman V Superman, but not much. It's enough to watch it more than once.",Suicide Squad
1547,ceraofficial,It isn't Marvel or Ridley Scott... But it is a solid contender!,8,4 August 2016,"Okay friendsI am pretty easy going with movies because i keep my hopes down low before heading into movies.. But for big winter (USA Summer) blockbusters, i can't help but conform and get my hopes up!! Now i say an 8/10.. But it only just made the cut, there were so many things done right with this movie that pin pointing the flaws is almost impossible for an amateur like myself. Overall, i loved will smith, and Harley Quin and the rest of the gang.. But the villain was maybe under promoted in how destructive he/she was.. It didn't help either that i thought the Joker was one of the main villains from seeing Leto's face plastered all over advertisement! If you want a brilliant movie to go and see, i would highly suggest not reading the reviews here first. So many people fall into this trap (my housemate included) and it ruins what can be a great movie. So PLEASE go and watch this movie and make your own judgment call!!!! The movie was a great piece of art and it pushed the story more towards the true comic universe of DC. If you liked the comics, and you like stereotypes of my people (Australian) then you will find this movie and absolute thrill ride with some really funny parts in-between all of the shooting!I just really hope the release an R rated version! M rated is just playing with my emotions because i really wanted to see some dead pool style action :/",Suicide Squad
1548,LuisValencia,"Entertaining, but poor in usual fundamentals",6,5 August 2016,"First off, this movie doesn't shine at all in terms of physical aspects, or even other elements that usually constitutes a movie that gets high ratings all around. There isn't much to say about the cinematography, the editing is distracting at times, the plot is second-rate, and more could have been done about the setting. In essence, the movie can objectively be considered as 'shoddy'. But what saves it is its high entertainment value.When it starts, everything goes well. The exposition sets up an anticipation that the next hour and forty minutes are going to be a blast. However, the first act ends and the zany plot begins almost instantly when the conflict and villain are simultaneously revealed. From then on, I still continued to thoroughly enjoy the movie, despite it abounding with flaws and all.The thing is that, to like the movie, you have to accept the silly premise and realize that it's purpose wasn't to become a celebrated film, or even a great blockbuster of the year. It's about a team of assembled ""supervillains"" taking on a crazy supernatural entity laying waste to the city. The story and pacing make for a refreshingly simple action picture from what we've come to normally expect from most recent movies - including comic book ones - that must always be fixed with some contrived narrative. So you have to sort of dim your brain, in a way. If you look at the movie subjectively, it could be looked at as being ""good"" akin to certain movies like the 2012 ""Dredd"" or something (except maybe with worse direction). Now even with that, other problems still affected the final outcome of ""Suicide Squad"". I felt that the characters needed to be more fleshed out and given depth, rather than having a cast of personalities we don't even know working together. Some characters with the highest potential like Joker, left us ambivalent about him due to his minimal screen time. The build up of the movie could also have used work, as it felt that the climax already started near the beginning without getting our feet wet first with the ensemble of bad guys.It's quite hard to justify why this movie gets a ""6"" with all these faults, but it mostly comes down to this: you can choose to enjoy it or not, and when you do, it definitely has a certain charm.",Suicide Squad
1549,amg-24406,Worst from dc,3,11 April 2017,"SPOILERS. Suicide squad was not entirely bad it did had some moments . But that's all it had. Poor script that could have done without a few characters. Slipknot was wasted,captain boomerang was wasted,katana was wasted,killer croc was wasted and worst of all they made batman look pathetic. This comes out from a man whose favourite movie is TDK the last outing of joker with batman. But that's not the only complain the editing was pathetic jump cuts that made no sense. The only characters who actually get screen time are deadshot and harley and even they don't fit in the script properly. The third act was boring The whole movie is about Dr june dying if the witch and guess what she lives The amount someone will spend reading this review (if someone actually does) will be more them slipknot's screen time was Ohhh man this movie was pathetic I was giving it a 5 rating but now i have changed my mind",Suicide Squad
1550,wcerdan,Great Movie! don't pay attention to bought critics or marvel-fanboys,7,8 August 2016,"Now I really think without any doubt that Marvel has bought critics and Marvel-fanboys are like an infection... Suicide Squad is excellent, the characters are very good and the performances are great. Will Smith is Deadshot, stunning work. Margot Robbie & Kara Delevigne are amazing, Robbie born to be Harley Quinn. And Diablo?... well DIABLO rocks!Great cast, everyone! Viola Davis, OMG! Jared Letto was a good Joker, do not compare with Ledger's Joker, this is a different Joker. Mr. Ayer you made an amazing DCEU movie!Go to watch this film, don't pay attention to bought critics or Marvel- fanboys opinions.I definitely want to see more of Suicide Squad!",Suicide Squad
1551,davidcharleslemon,Better than I thought it was going to be,4,5 August 2016,"Let me first start off saying that Jared Leto is the worst adapted Joker I have ever seen. He was not as psychotic and scary as the Joker should be. And he only had about 10 minutes of screen time. This took off one star of the overall rating.But enough of that. I want to talk about the good side of this movie. David Ayer did a good job picking Robbie as Harley Quinn. He could not have picked a better actress for this role. During the promotions and adds for this film I thought that they were trying to shove captain boomerang down our throats, and I thought he was going to be horrible. But boy was I wrong, Jai Courtney had an amazing performance.Another downside of this movie were the villain and Slipknot. The villain was dead a** Weak. He had no point to the movie. I feel like the producers took only five minutes to put him there to have a point as to why the squad was together. And Slipknot, oh my god, he was the pussy of the month, Dying with only two minutes of overall screen time. He didn't even kill anyone! But to be honest, I had no idea he existed until I saw the movie. But I guess it's good not to build up all the hype only to kill him off two minutes after he's introduced.Another thing I want to add is the soundtrack. It is worth the price of admission itself. Just wait until you see the movie, then you'll understand.But overall, this is a pretty good movie. Good for date night, or just for some summer fun. Suicide Squad - 8/10",Suicide Squad
1552,cyrilthemusical,Suicide Squad Not Bad A they say,8,6 August 2016,"The movie is definitely Fun to watch! I, along with my friends enjoyed the Humour inserted all though some of the dialogues showed that they tried pushing the humour... I loved Joker, Harley Quinn, Headshot as well as El Diablo! I enjoyed the animated Killer Croc. All though I have had mixed feeling about Enchantress i still was disappointed about the enchantress's Brother being animated. Also pushing deadshot as thinking about his Daughter was definitely not working for me or any of my friends... I am happy about seeing Batman. The movie was of great pace.... the action sequence was fun! I enjoyed so many things. David Ayer definitely made the Dark DC theme very appealing!! The dancing fire in El diablo was so cool!! i definitely Love the movie so did my friends! Its not a super awesome movie, but definitely a treat for the eyes!",Suicide Squad
1553,filimaua,An entertaining but messy film,6,13 August 2016,"I was super excited to see this movie, only to be disappointed. The good things about this movie are the portrayals of Deadshot, Harley Quinn and El Diablo. They were the highlight characters of the movie and the only ones given the spotlight. Well except El Diablo. I loved the humanity of Deadshot and the insanity of Harley Quinn. The action sequences were quite good. Only good. That's pretty much the only good things.There are many bad things about this movie, and we'll start with characters and writing. Deadshot, Harley, El Diablo and the Joker are the only characters that I genuinely liked. Some of the others were useless to the plot and are given no character development.Enchantress was a horrible choice as the villain, she should have stayed as part of the squad. The plot of the film is the squad being sent out to stop Enchantress from wrecking havoc in the middle of the city as she is busy making a weapon that will be used to wipe out mankind. No reason, no good enough reason on why. The reason Enchantress is a horrible choice is because she is an all-powerful witch with godlike powers. Considering how powerful she is, she is an unrealistic villain against the squad. Only El Diablo realistically had any chance against her. Had a better mission been chosen against a villain that could actually be taken down from this squad, this movie could've been better.Joker was also a disappointment. I like the modern gangster take on him, but that's all he is in this movie. He isn't insane enough, and a force of chaos. Just a love sick gangster. His relationship with Harley also should've been a bit more abusive. His subplot in the film wasn't needed. Taking Joker out of the film, and keeping him in the flashbacks could've given more time on fleshing out the other characters. Hope they do better with Joker's character in future films.The first half although better than the second, spent too much time explaining backstories of some of the characters through flashbacks. Bad characters, boring plot, wrong choice of villain and many writing and editing problems, rather than focusing on the squad working together and letting them be criminals who save the world by doing bad things for the government.Other than that, an entertaining film but just a mess.",Suicide Squad
1554,samuzik,Big budget fair movie,7,8 August 2016,"Ayer simply asked a group of professional actors dressed like Suicide Squad to walk along the streets. He degraded high potential materials to a pure cosplay show. The different plots in the film fail each other. If you got a bomb in your body, the plot to unite got no tension. Then, after relaxing in a bar, they unite. They are cool bad guys, they don't unite! They do bad things to portray their characters in comics instead of telling embarrassing jokes and cosplay. Torn between these are some helicopter crashes. Nothing major really happens for a mid-climax. You at least need a 15 minutes sequence of action instead of several 2 minutes action scenes like interruptions! The tension just lost. And Jared Leto's Joker is outstanding and unique. How come you hire talent like Jared Leto to portray such a complicated character but only gives him 10 minutes? Is it an audition ? Actually all actors perform well but the production team put them in a plot that got no chance to show off. For BvS, it clearly got a theme and direction to move on even it may not please the mass market. Suicide Squad is a messy talent deployment. It is clearly not an commercial action flick but also got no clear theme.The response of this movie is a final warning to Warner Brothers. I truly think that they should shut down all productions including Wonder Woman and sit down to rethink the whole strategy. No reason to rush in a wrong direction. Besides, do they recognize that the reverse approach from Marvel makes you losing audience who does not read comics ? Most film lovers in Asia only know Iron Man from RDJ. There were enough Superman and Batman movies in history providing enough background information. But other characters really need deeper portray to secure audience before pushing all super hero on stage in a united team.",Suicide Squad
1555,caoimhemglally,Extremely Hyped Up,5,10 August 2016,"Since the announcement of the cast of Suicide Squad last summer, there has been nothing but excitement for this film. A star-studded cast that included my favourite actor Jared Leto, as the Joker alongside, Will Smith and Margot Robbie only rendered a movie that was to bound to impress. I had eagerly been anticipating the film for the past year however, my standards were soon crushed almost 20 minutes into the movie.I am not a huge comic book fan however, I do enjoy DC Comics and Marvel blockbusters, and this movie did not reach my expectations. The best part about Suicide Squad was the very many trailers that were released throughout the year. The trailers showed each of the characters that were to be portrayed and left fans questioning what the story-line would entail. The fact that there was such little known about the story-line was something I found to be extremely enticing as it brought up the hype even more.However, upon viewing the movie, I realised exactly why the emphasis was completely on the actors and their character portrayal and not the story-line. This was because the film literally had no story-line. The director David Ayers put all his focus into what A-list Hollywood actors he could get to star in his movie in order to grab the audiences attention rather than writing a good plot for a movie that had so much potential. The one positive aspect of Suicide Squad was the acting and I thoroughly enjoyed the performances of both Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as the Joker. In my opinion, this sub-plot carried the entire movie and it was easy to pick up on the emotional and physical abusive relationship deeply rooted between the two. It was disappointing that the Joker did not play a bigger part as it would have been interesting to see how far Jared Leto could take the character.It felt as if there was no build up to the final 'fight scene' and it all just happened at once with no breaks or relief in between. The plot development would have made the movie more realistic and empathetic if the turn of events did not take place all in one night and it was clear from the beginning what exactly the suicide squad were being rallied up for. From my understanding, Enchantress was also going to be part of the elite squad to take down evil terrorists, Amanda Waller continuously harked on about. However, Enchantress ended up becoming said terrorist alongside her brother, which I felt was a plot-hole. Did Waller know this was going to happen all along? Who were the original terrorists if Enchantress did not take over June Moon's body?Overall, Suicide Squad was a big disappointment mainly due to the story-line. With such a talented cast of some of the biggest names in Hollywood at the moment, it was obvious the movie was going to set itself up for failure if it did not reach the expectations of fans. The main reason I gave the movie 5 stars was solely based on the characters Harley Quinn, the Joker and the sub-plot of their relationship that was portrayed.",Suicide Squad
1556,jakwieci,Some excellent performances mired in a meaningless story,6,10 August 2016,"Suicide Squad Movie ReviewA 'movie' can mean many things to many people. Some people see a 'film', consisting of characters engaged in stories that describe a plot. Some people see a massive spectacle of shiny things and loud sounds. Some people just want to smile a little for two hours.No one is 'right' or 'wrong'. You pay your money, and either you get something you enjoy, or you don't.If you're looking for a 'film', this is not it. There is no plot. The stories are flimsy at best, and non existent for long stretches. Some characters appear to have some depth once in a while, but not much, and not for long. Plenty of others are even shallower.If you're looking for a spectacle of shiny things and loud sounds, there's plenty of those, but Suicide isn't chocked full of them. There are bigger spectacles if that's what you want.If you just want to smile for a couple hours, then you may well be in luck. Will Smith (as Deadshot) is a Movie Star (capital M, capital S). He oozes charm. He gives his full effort and can pull off gravitas when needed, and timing for when comic relief is needed. Margot Robbie (as Harly Quinn) is his on screen equal, providing a demented gravitas and delivering her lines and actions with perfection. Between the two of them, they form an unlikely couple that at no point ever feels likely, yet doesn't feel forced. The movie rests on their shoulders entirely, but they are up to the task. While Smith and Robbie form the twin pillars supporting this movie, Viola Davis (as Amanda Waller) and Jared Leto (as The Joker) both put in fantastic performances. Davis plays the stock government agent who isn't afraid to bend the rules to get things done. It is an effortless performance, if anyone could run a shadow world government, it's Davis. The problem is the character simply has an arc that implodes. Davis's character feels worse than wasted, but rather deliberately turned into something useless.Similarly Leto's Joker is amazing and entirely pointless. My own 'idea' of the Joker is the Mark Hamill version from the Batman cartoons of the 90s. He's psychotic, but ultimately a crime lord. He wants to be rich. Jack Nicholson's Joker touched on this, but didn't really capture it. Heath Ledger's Joker is, a master performance, but still diminishes the character itself. Leto has captured the same energy that Ledger has tapped into, while grounding the Joker into the world as the psychotic crime lord. The thing is, there is no room in the plot of Suicide Squad for a psychotic crime lord, so Leto makes the most of his screen time, but, the time is not time well spent.There are other characters and actors in the movie. I don't remember who they are or what they do. Something about killing innocent people. The 'good' guys have a much higher body count than the 'bad' guys, although I'm starting to think that might be the go to move for DC comics movies. There are a LOT of bad things that I can say about this movie, but honestly, I liked it. Smith, Robbie, Leto and Davis bring it, and their performances deserve to be appreciated. If everyone else was cut out, and we focused on just these four, we might have something truly special.Instead, we just get something pretty good.I'm willing to spend 2 hours watching something pretty good.",Suicide Squad
1557,gmk-03039,Suicide Squad Rocks!,8,12 August 2016,The movie had a great intro， great soundtrack which fitted the film really well and 4 characters in particular for me stole the show: Viola Davis' Amanda Waller portrayal was flawless，Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was another flawless portrayal，Deadshot and finally The Joker...I am probably going to get a lot hate for saying this but I really enjoyed and preferred Jared Leto's portrayal than Heath Ledger's (even though his performance was greatly entertaining)，Jared Leto's Joker was much more DC Comics as Heath Ledger's was not at all. The flashbacks were great and I loved how the team assembled as it did not feel rushed or unnatural. El Diablo has some great dialogues and moments， Captain Boomerang had a few good lines like Killer Croc did but I felt Katana was under used at times. It also had a Justice League/Avengers/Guardians of the Galaxy feel to it at times. What kept it from a perfect 10 was that I didn't get enough of the Joker， certain characters were slightly under used and that some of the editing was questionable. but not for 1 second you will be bored in this movie!,Suicide Squad

This is the main reason I don't get the bad reviews. Don't get me wrong there are some bad movies out there, but in this case this is not one of them. To start, we can all say Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was Fantastic. Will Smith was also great as Deadshot although some people think he can only play that kind of character. And Jared Leto as The Joker was very good but had very little screen time. The movie itself was full of action, fun, and had some comedy. Although the plot was messy, the entire movie was just awesome. I give it 10/10 for characters, 10/10 for action and enjoyment and 7/10 for the entire story.

The only good characters are the Joker, who is actually pretty good, Harley Quinn who's humour and personality is played perfectly and Deadshot, because Will smith, but that doesn't compensate for a lack of character development, poor villain and some bad editing. If you are a hardcore Dc fan then you might enjoy this but this film is not worth watching otherwise",Suicide Squad
1560,ratboy-82638,Not Deadpool,4,29 August 2016,"I tried hard to think of a good example but I couldn't, the simple premise is that Will Smith doesn't play well with others stands true. And that fact ruined what could've been such a brilliant anti-superhero film. The plot while complex and very convoluted could have been a lot easier to grasp if the Suicide Squad was just that. Instead there was a bunch of misfits whose only purpose was to listen to Deadshot and do what he says. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto were just born to play natural born killers with love for only each other. While Harley provided most of the sick, twisted humour that a film like this should thrive on. The rest of the characters seemed held back and harmless, fun but that's all they were padding. Not the worst or the best!!!",Suicide Squad
1561,megascene,I expected better.,5,25 August 2016,"Overall it wasn't the worst movie that I've seen. Not even close to being the best either though. I had my hopes oh so high for this movie and now I kind of do regret not having lowered them before I saw it. It wasn't all that bad. Pros were for example: great cast, interesting story line and that it really follows the original comics in many ways. But it had a lot of cons: The movie was, in a way, too focused on Harley Quinn (yeah, unpopular opinion but I really saw it that way), obvious plot and that it doesn't follow the comics in the right ways.Sure, Margot Robbie did an amazing version of Harley Quinn. I absolutely loved it at first but as I watched the movie, I became more and more annoyed with it. For example I miss her accent. Her accent is one of the things that make Harley Quinn, Harley Quinn. And her outfit... I think it's fantastic and unique but I wish they hadn't mixed it with the blue. Red and Black are awesome. Jared Leto also did a fantastic job playing the joker. Personally not a favorite but I adored it. But the movie didn't need him. If he wasn't in the movie it wouldn't have made that much of a difference. It's not really a movie I would watch again nor recommend but it is well worth watching maybe once in your lifetime.",Suicide Squad
1562,roland9d,"A box of uppers, shoved down your throat",1,15 August 2016,"I guess I'm one of those people whose first review in this site is not out of love, but out of hate. I confess: I was appalled by this movie and everything it entailed. And I'm here to rant.If somebody asks me in the next few days (until I can shrug the rant off): ""What's wrong with the world?"" I'm going to say ""That movie, Suicide Squad"". The very thought that this movie exists, a truckload of money invested in it, and people going ""wow awesome!"" is what's wrong with the world. I guess that's what happens when everything and anything around you today operates as some kind of ""upper"". And this movie is yet another box of uppers: every element that goes into the art of cinema - sound (echo that laughter), music (shuffle: on), editing (don't stop time is money gogogo!), character development (""that's slipknot, man who can climb anything""), plot (belly-dancer who wants to destroy the world with an army of people turned into goo ***SPOILER ALERT*** is defeated by BAD BUT SOPHISTICATED people), cinematography (MAGIC TENTACLES! KABOOM!!) - each act as some sort of stimulant to get you ""up"" on your seat, with the obligatory trivialized sexuality thrown in (""wow that woman is a stunner, and she's crazy!""), for a full 2 hours. For the young and eager it can result in a trip (a bad one that you'll regret later), for others who've been there it's likely to bring you down instead. I guess back in the day I did have a more tolerant approach like ""meh, it is what it is."" Or maybe I was somewhere between that and ""this is BS"". Now I'm firmly at ""this is BS and I want my 2 hours back"". And you know what... Even BS used to have some dignity, and integrity. To end this on a less rantish note. Do yourself a favor and watch ""Assault on Arkham"" instead. Or play one of those Batman video games (or watch a ""game movie"" version of it on youtube)... Or maybe stare at a wall and think about things... Oh well, there goes the less rantish note.",Suicide Squad
1563,trollburger,what is this crap?,1,27 November 2016,"This movie is a piece of crap filled with crap that is just summed up nicely. I highly recommend watching for making fun of such crap that is in this vagina of a movie. Margot Robbie has nothing but booty shots most of the movie and is pure eye-candy, Jared Leto looks like a Joker Fanboy Wannabe Wangster too pasty for grills, tattoos look kindergarten at best maybe preschooler could do better designs. Why were they fighting zombies in Suicide Squad this isn't World War Z which is a lot better than this garbage. I can see why Jared Leto's scenes got cut out because he sucked donkey d**ks. Pathetic how he tries to act like The Joker and failed miserably. When did the Joker ever get tattoos, where the F is his smile? Why is the smile on his hand that's not Joker and the Grills is too Black and he's a pasty white boy wannabe gangsta. Good thing they didn't do that to Will Smith or that would have just been wrong. Harley Quinn using the bat as a shotgun she would just pull one out and start shooting people. Killer Croc didn't even look like Killer Croc he looked like The Thing from Fantastic 4. Batman Villains do not have super powers! Have they ever read the comics or seen Batman The Animated Series THAT'S THE LEGIT STUFF THERE PEOPLE! True DC Fans would call this a heaping pile of whale dung. Fake DC Fans would like this garbage that a whale pooped out. If you seen whale poop you know what I mean. The hype was just like Zilla 98 which ended up being the worst movie ever. If you seen Godzilla Final Wars where Zilla got her butt kicked, they need to do the same with Mark Hamill's Joker vs Jared Leto's Joker. Jared Leto would be destroyed in a minute like Zilla to Godzilla.(Spoiler on Godzilla Final Wars) This movie was a waste of time saw it for 10 minutes and walked away from it. It was too boring to start. I knew it was going to be a disaster from the Trailers and should have stuck to my gut about it instead of blowing 20 bucks at the theater. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!

1564,scarecrow-00856,How to kill a franchise 101,3,2 January 2017,"This movie is bad, real bad. There is nothing good about it, just some mediocre things. Most of the movie is bad though. The beginning is like a trailer after trailer, play some hip music (even if it doesn't fit the mood at all), show a character and repeat several times.Visually the movie isn't very good either. The CG is not bad, but the whole movie is unnecessarily dark, even when the characters stand in direct sunlight or in a room that is on fire it is dark. The characters should have been the best part of the movie, it is quite the opposite. Deadshot is OK, but Will Smith is too charismatic to play a ruthless assassin. Captain Boomerang was surprisingly enjoyable, he was the only believable criminal. He had no higher motivation, he was just an asshole who cares only about himself. El Diablo was rather undeveloped. Killer Croc was forgettable. Katana felt like she was shoved in last minute, no explanation, rushed backstory that didn't really explain anything. Slipknot was there just so they could kill somebody off. The villains were relatively fine (for this movie's standard). I intentionally left Harley Quinn and Joker last. Harley Quinn was incredibly annoying, in all the wrong ways. Joker was absolutely butchered. DC's best villain ruined in about 20 minutes he had in this movie.

This is made worse by the fact that the makers of this film felt the need to shoehorn poorly fitting pop culture songs into every character introduction in an attempt to mask the cringe-worthy dialogue and forced humor. The second half of the film is a mindless snooze-fest almost completely void of logic or reason. The villain is unbearable, the characters empty, and the dialogue actually gets worse.I applaud DC for taking the risk of making a film about bad guys playing the good guy role, but unfortunately the final product is shockingly bad.

It was a slog but I'm glad I did as I believe there is a lot to be learned from this movie.Suicide Squad stops at nothing to razzle-dazzle the audience with extended scenes of destruction, explosions, gunfire and over-the-top f/x. All this despite having very little heart or anything the audience should connect to or care about. There is no time to get to know a character before we're introduced to yet more supposedly badass characters (all with the hokiest setups) until we (or at least I) barely cared about any single one of them. This is a great example of a movie that overstretches itself with the number of characters but just doesn't deliver the emotional connection that better movies can achieve with just a handful of fleshed-out, well-written characters.The f/x were what you'd expect for a movie with this big of a budget. Some shots I'm sure took many thousands of hours of labor to put together, but at the end of the day they are weightless and forgettable because I was emotionally checked out. I don't mind movies with over the top spectacles of violence and mayhem but they have to serve the story and be meaningful within the context of that narrative. From watching this, it seems the production mindset was more 'just give the people explosions and broad character tropes, they won't taste the difference.'Overall, I did not enjoy this movie but still think it should be understood and learned from.

1590,rantsratingsandreviews,Disappointing,3,27 May 2020,"I was so incredibly disappointed with this movie. Almost the entire cast was amazing, and it had so much potential, but this film just fell short in so many ways. The premise was pretty interesting: the stereotypical bad guys team up to save the world. But boy oh boy does it just flat out stray into stupid sci-fi territory. It gets to a point where the story is just ruined and makes no logical sense at all; it's borderline not even entertaining. If I hadn't payed three bucks to rent this trainwreck, I would've stopped watching about halfway into the movie. Margot Robbie and Will Smith had their talents truly wasted with this one. The only thing really redeeming this movie in the slightest is the cast itself and the characters' boo-hoo backstories, which are the only slightly interesting things there are to witness in this film. With that set aside, the script is boring, the action sequences are laughable, and again, the story is just downright outrageous to the point where it's no longer interesting. I was really looking forward to seeing the bad guys save the world, but it ended up just being another disappointment.",Suicide Squad
1591,supersayain90,"Wow, that was bad",4,9 August 2016,"How did we come from 'The Dark Knight' released 8 years ago to this???? And, before I get heckled, I am 100% open to new takes on characters and story lines. Heck, if this revitalization of these franchises didn't occur, things would get stale pretty quickly.However, having just seen this, I am in complete disbelief as to how DC has managed to steer themselves this far downhill. This movie is miles away from the storytelling and character development that was on show in Nolans Superhero masterpiece.It started off OK - a fun and colorful take on character introduction, but it was clear that there were only two characters in this squad that this movie really wanted to focus on, namely the two big names headlining the film. Deadpool was portrayed well, though it would have been great to introduce him with a bit more of a showcase on his skills. I didn't like the whole Harley / Joker thing however. I think Margot Robbie was perfectly cast but the Joker was a big misfire for me. This surprised me, as going by the general gist of these reviews on IMDb, it seems that a lot of people actually liked this casting and the subsequent character interaction. Personally, I felt the Joker was a little too..... normal?; almost like a typical mobster with some makeup and hair dye. He didn't have that maniacal essence that Heath Ledger and even Jack Nicholson portrayed so effectively.Rounding out the other characters - Killer Croc was too small (why are they intent on reducing the size of these characters? - just like they did with Apocalypse in X-Men) and his impact was not menacing enough. Diablo was fine until the end - what the hell happened there! Slipknot was the sacrificial lamb as anyone who knew anything about Suicide Squad could tell from a mile away. Captain Boomerang has so much more potential than was shown, and I actually could tolerate Jai Courtenay, which amazed me. Rick Flag was terrible - Joel Kinnaman is a real hit and miss actor and at times in this he resembled a drug addict more than a super soldier. Kitana was a real background character, and her choreography in the film was terrible.However, all in all, it was the storytelling and the poor action that really let this film down. There was a need for characters to constantly remind each other what to do, just to keep the idea of the plot flowing. ""Harley! If he dies, we die"". The antagonists in both this film and BvS have turned this franchise too much towards a reliance on CG - something that done well can be game changing (as Marvel has shown), however this was not done well and does not do the movie any favors.I walked out of the film deflated. Batman v Superman had its OK parts, but this film was the nail in the coffin for DC as far as I am concerned. This saddens me deeply. Batman is my world. It is my screen name on Playstation and Boom Beach (to name but a few), and I have lived and breathed this character since I was a 5 year old stepping into Tim Burtons first take on the caped crusader. To see his 'house' collapsing around him is killing me. DC has to take a step back on this one and think what they are doing. This is not the way",Suicide Squad

1597,stemenik,Cheerful bad guys,3,17 March 2021,"OK so I'm not a superhero comics reader, I can't rely on all the knowledge the reviewers keep showing when discussing the characters, or the different - and apparently, competing - superhero sagas. I'm even frankly amazed at all that competence.What brought me here was honestly Harley Queen's ass. I just wanted to witness how this fantastic icon, apparently born in this specific form just within this mess of a movie, is moving around and developing and building up, I wanted to hear her voice. I need to say I'm quite satisfied with her character, all the potential is there for something bound to remain in people's memory long after the movie will be totally and deservedly forgotten. HQ is by far the only enjoyable thing in the movie.Talking about that, well the girl is crazy enough, mildly sexualised (seems like they're trying hard to have her look *very* sexualised but that's all plastic anyhow) and seemingly not being very easily offended. Despite all that the all-male squad - sorry is there that ""Katana"" too...? Katana who? Nice nickname for a girl using a katana non-stop - is always addressing her so politely, with an astonishing decency so stupidly unreal. What, aren't they the baddest among the bad? The worst dregs of society? The public enemys #2 on? - #1 being the Jocker of course... Ahah -Clearly in contemporary movies villains know very well how to behave and always be politically correct. Hilariously bad.The most tragically comic part of the movie is when the supposed evil in full-power Enchantress, having the evil-from-the-other-side Amanda totally subdued, thus being able to have the entire squad's heads instantly blown up, induces instead in their heads ""their wildest dreams"" with the aim to distract them. So you find that Deadshot just wants to shot Batman dead, while HQ dreams of a middle-class family life with her darling Jocker and 2 blond toddles, and El Diablo just wants his family back. Luckily we're spared Killer Croc dreaming of some Tony Manero's moves surrounded by cheering girls. I mean, are these the inner most sought-after desires of the craziest assassins Amanda was able to source? More like, lazy deluded middle-class guys?The depressing outcome is that these bad guys aren't bad guys at all, they're just a shadow, a paper-thin drawing, a failed hint at bad guys. They're the bad guys next door. Especially this, more than the stupid and lazy script, more than obvious plot holes, more than ineffective monsters, makes this movie a sad mess. I know that this is based on a comic strip, where they don't usually delve on tense character development, here however the level is that of flatlining emptiness. As long as in comics, evil characters can be flat, but sure they can be truly evil.Particularly bad is Deadshot's character - the ice-hearted killer not shooting Batman, thus being held prisoner by him, because his teen daughter asks him. The later hint of his dear daughter treasuring geometry with him to her interest in bullets' trajectories is one of the all-time lows in the movie. So badly out-of-character with no reason.Honorable mention for Cara Delevigne - I don't like her even when she's on her arguably competent side, modeling. Can you imagine how I feel by looking at her trying to act...?The 3 stars are all for Harley Queen. Too bad that this version of hers will start and end with this movie.",Suicide Squad

That is worth $150,000,000 in box office alone. Otherwise this movie was really really bad...

1604,nb99,"A Fun, Lighthearted Summer Blockbuster",8,18 October 2021,"I'm not particularly into the DC/Marvel genre, so watched this as a ""standalone"" film. I found it entertaining, fast paced (except the slight lull before the final battle scene) and a lot of fun. The soundtrack was exceptional, the humour was good and some of the characters were great. Yes the portrayal of the Joker was a little over-the-top, yes the ending was a little predictable, no Cara Levene is not going to be nominated for an Oscar, but was I entertained for 2 hours? Yes I certainly was.It's ideally watched in a cinema or with a great surround sound system at home. The first half is stronger than the second half. I can't tell you if it's true to the original comics. But if you want some light-hearted, great fun action with a killer soundtrack, look no further, this is the film for you! 8.5/10 for me.",Suicide Squad

1606,navjotjsingh,Worst Comic Book Movie I have ever seen,1,20 November 2016,"Forget every bad comic book movie you have seen till now, because Suicide Squad takes the cake for being hands down the worst comic book movie ever made.If you thought BvS was terrible, then this is just atrocious. At least BvS extended version improved upon the original and frankly you wouldn't mind watching it one more time. Can't say the same for Suicide Squad.I never saw it in theaters because it started receiving so many negative reviews. And then the news of its extended version came. So I thought, why not?And now I want my 2 hours 14 minutes back. Nothing in this movie makes sense. Not the jokes. Not the characters. Not their motivations except that of Deadshot. Even Harley Quinn's character was all over the place. Joker was turned into an extra. He wasn't even necessary to the movie.There wasn't much plot either. Enchantress could have been an awesome villain and with her possessing the body of a human could have added so many layers to the character. But nope. Standing in the middle of the city shooting electricity and lights out of the sky for most part is the only thing she did. And yes, turned human beings into faceless and comical creatures which seemed to pose not much harm to anyone and could as easily be destroyed by Quinn's bat.Will Smith as Deadshot is the only thing that was worth watching. But I had one complaint with his character. For most of the movie, he was a guy who wanted to go back to his family. There was no Deadshot. There were no crazy Deadshot fight scenes you would come to expect from such a movie.In fact there is no crazy action scene you would expect from such a movie. Not even one. Everything looked easy. Batman's cameo wasn't effective either and couldn't save the movie. So if you were thinking that Extended version will save this movie, you are wrong. Watch only if you enjoyed it in theaters.",Suicide Squad
1607,subanmashkoor,You sweet talking me? All that chit chat's gonna get ya hurt...,8,7 August 2016,"Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you People? ""We're critics, it's what we do.""Well the critics are at it again. To the life of me I don't get why these critics have it in for DC Universe, tho one thing that does come to mind is, these reviews are being bank rolled by Disney. No doubt trying to catch up with decade's worth of hits and misses from Marvel Studios was never going to be easy. BvS was a step in the right direction, far from being the winning goal in the World Cup final but a great shot nevertheless. MoS and BvS were needed to build a foundation albeit to some a shaky one a foundation nevertheless.Anyho Suicide Squad is a good movie I mean so many things could have gone wrong, and some certain aspects of the movie did for some. For example having a new joker so soon after the late Heath Ledger immortalised the Joker, but Jared Leto did it proud. Yes DC and WB could have taken their time with introducing the squad and the cameos could have been done better, like BvS it all feels rushed, but it's far from being a bad movie. The fact that Will Smith was in this. Same Will Smith coming on to a so called ""sinking ship"" with a string of flops (apart from focus), with a character not so known or well established as the Joker, Harley Quinn. But it works Deadshot delivers. I liked the other Suicide Squad members they were spot on with there takes on the comic characters too, a deeper look in to them would have been better, so wouldn't mind to see them drop in to the DC extended Universe time to time.I do feel more of the Joker and Harley Quinn, better use of cameos, better narrative, tighter story, better foe would have turned this GOOD movie into a GREAT ONE. I've said before to my friends, I just think WB is rushing to establish a DC Universe and making mistakes along the way, but these mistake ain't that direr for critics to pan the first few DC Universe films far from it.So here's hoping Ben Affleck and WB are paying attention to the fans appreciation to the King and Queen of Gotham City. Give them a standalone or bring them in to the fold for the next Batman or Justice League movie. To be honest throw in Killer Croc and Deadshot as the foes for Bens first Batman won't be a bad idea either. Like I said in my review to BvS ""DC Universe is truly and rightfully on its way"" and Suicide Squad went a long way to establishing this fact. They need to start taking their time with story and script writing, they need to get one just one movie right with the critics and the fans alike and the rest will fall in place. I really believe Wonder Woman will change that and be that one movie to demand better for WB, not saying Wonder Woman will be the winning goal, but it'll surely level the playing field.""Feeling the world go against us So we put the world on our shoulders"". Loving the soundtrack to Suicide Squad. ""Purple Lamborghini"" by Skrillex & Rick Ross and ""Sucker for Pain"" by Imagine Dragons and various artist are my favourites.Before I sign off, leave you with some wise words from Wreck Ralph ""I am bad and that is good, I will never be good and that's not bad, there's no one I'd rather be than me"". F**k Critics Obi out.",Suicide Squad
1608,dreadlocmask,All the critics were WRONG!!! Great Film!!!,10,6 August 2016,"The critics were DEAD WRONG about this.Suicide Squad was a great film and an awesome continuation of the DCEU. It had a great story to it, the characters were utilized properly (though Deadshot was portrayed almost as a hero), and the action sequences were amazing. David Ayer kept the spirit of the comics alive in this.The Joker was well done by Jared Leto. Yes, a lot of the Joker scenes were cut from the film, but it was a good thing that they did so. It would have the taken away from the film too much. Will Smith as Deadshot was a good choice. He did a good job with that. Margot Robbie hit it dead on as Harley Quinn. There was no better choice. Jai Courtney as Boomerang was good, as well as Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje for Killer Croc and Karen Fukuhara as Katana. Jay Hernandez was good as El Diablo. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was superb.*SPOILERS* The story with the Enchantress and her brother, going on a rampage for what Waller did to Enchantress was a great way to do this film. The Joker as an interruption to the mission was a great use of the character. They did a great job.DC is doing a better job with more mature story lines than Marvels right now.That being said, to all of the critics out there: GO EAT A BAG OF DICKS!!! SUICIDE SQUAD IS AWESOME!!!",Suicide Squad
1609,ravemangtbc,I liked it!,8,7 August 2016,"I enjoyed this movie! But I also enjoyed the critical disappoint that was Batman V Superman. The soundtrack to this film is great like Guardains of the Galaxy not that, that is a reason to see a movie. But I felt that Will Smith gave a better performance in this film than he did in Concussion the film he and his wife felt he was cheated out of a nomination for but I feel he didn't earn it with his performance in that film. Also Margot Robbie as Harley I felt was great she called The Joker, Mister J and Puddin like she did in the animated series were she first came from there's also a flashback scene of her in her ""original"" outfit. I was worried they would just overalls sexualize her and reduce her to eye candy and while she is that both sexualized and eye candy she is also one of two characters were are given a backstory for and are more fully developed. Margot portrayal was inspired and she pulled off the quirky humor/insanity/love that are Harley. I don't know how I feel about Jared Leto's Joker as he looked so ""thug"" line in the film with all his tattoos and capped teeth. The way he acted as The Joker was good it's more of his appearance that I have some ""issues"" with I guess. Also he doesn't have much screen time as The Joker is a background character who pops up randomly through out the film much like he did in The Dark Knight only even less screen time in this film and his actions aren't as plot driving as the were in TDK. I don't know that I buy the conspiracy theory that Disney/Marvel is paying off critics to write bad reviews on DC films but I do feel they are criticized more heavily and far less favorably than their Marvel counterparts. One critic being that the DC films seem to have a darker tone than the lighthearted and more humorous Marvel films but DC characters that have been portrayed in recent films aren't known for their humor or wit and DC Comics tend to be darker in nature than Marvel ones so I feel that is an unfair critic considering the source material.At any rate go see the film and decide for yourself but as a fan of movies and comics I enjoyed it. It may not be the best ""superhero"" ever made but it is a good film with solid performances and the first female super villain and no I don't mean Harley but the actual ""big bad"" of the film. I hope they make more Squad films and that the DC universe continues to grow and get better and reach the success and quality of Marvel's films!",Suicide Squad
1610,koochka,Seen Avengers?,3,26 December 2017,"If you have seen Avengers you have seen Suicide Squad. Same plot, same action, just a little different story line. At times difficult to follow, Joker comes and goes and really plays no real part in this movie but character was huge on the promos. Batman character was extremely limited and could of been written to play a much bigger role. Honestly the movie only deserves 2 stars but Harley Quinn's character and beauty adds a star all on her own.",Suicide Squad
1611,prty100,Maybe the worst film of 2016,1,6 August 2016,"It's amazing, just amazing, to see how nothing works in that film. The action is well directed but boring because there isn't connection to the characters. No character gets development or depth: Most of them getting clichéd backstories and the rest are appeared without a reason or explanation. The script is very bad: Incoherent, idiotic and uninteresting. I don't know what this movie was about and I don't care about that. The direction is childish, enthusiastic and makes headache. I was so relieve when this cinematic nightmare was end.Margot Robbie was cute as Harley Queen but her gimmick is runs its course in the middle of the film. Will Smith, most of the time with a lot of charisma, is doing nothing but reciting his clichéd script lines. Jared Leto isn't bad but he misses the character of the Joker: He supposes to be scary and threatening, not cool mobster with green colored hair and face with white makeup.I suffered in that film. I wish 'Suicide Squad' will be a huge failure that bury the DCCU. I have no more expectations from the future films of that cinematic universe. Marvel and Deadpool wins.",Suicide Squad
1612,lucutos,So Underrated,8,10 August 2021,"After watching the 2021 sequel, and rewatching this, this movie deserves so much more than the hate it got, they should've continued the snyder DC universe, it's grimmer and darker, and that's all it should be from Dark Comics after allDavid Ayer deserves to be recognized, it's hell a lot better than aquaman or ww84.",Suicide Squad

I watched it last night (premier show in Australia) and take my word for it!Stop reading reviews and what critics have to say about it! Please go and watch it for yourselves.As for a review, I agree that the plot could have been better (not by much though). It is definitely miles ahead of BVS.The cast had good chemistry and this spawned amazing performances by Viola, Jared, Margot and Will, in that specific order. For those who claim that Jared ruined Ledger's joker, know that in the comics, joker's behaviour is by no means uniform! In other words, there is no need for those two portrayals to be the same...Special effects are amazing as expected and music was spot on!It is difficult to write a lot without including spoilers! Let me reiterate, go watch the movie in theatres! What you spend will definitely be worth it...",Suicide Squad
1614,MyopicVision,A Female Perspective of what could have been a bromance movie,8,7 August 2016,OK so Im kidding with the title. Suicide Squad is far from being a movie where men come together and weep about how life has done them wrong but in some sense it was leaning that way a few times. Every single character had an Achilles heel. Some more more benign than others (Pink Unicorns anyone?) and it set up the movie in a way that I have to say did seem to be showcasing each character for a future movie. All except one. I hope he was well paid for his part. RIP. So to the meat and bones of this review. I want to focus on the females because thats where my interest lay. I wanted to see how the DC world would present strong female characters. I wasn't disappointed. I felt invested in each and every villain and that is coming from someone who is new to the DC universe. If the idea was to introduce viewers like me to characters that did not fill their childhood lore then they surely achieved success. Harli Quinn did more for girl power in this movie than every single song in the Spice Girls collection. She was bad ass. She kicked ass when she needed to (What was that bat made of!) and submitted to her twisted love affair with the Joker at just the right time. I loved her and can not wait to see her again. Katana's character had no flesh. Literally. It could just as well have inhabited the sword with her dead husband. Honestly I was hoping that someone would put an end to her sooner rather than later. Sorry she brought nothing to the story at all. Enchantress seemed to be channeling Queen of the Damned for this role. All that swaying of hips and arm juxtaposing felt very very familiar. Cara tried her best and was a wonderful June but her destroy the world because no one worships me anymore alter ego was just blah. Over all there was more than enough to enjoy and the missteps were just that. Missteps. This was an enjoyable movie that really did what all the hype claimed it would do.,Suicide Squad
1615,BDabi,A huge mess.,4,5 August 2016,"I hate to say this, but Suicide Squad is a huge, HUGE mess. The movie is a pastiche of flat jokes that rarely land, failed attempts at creating tension between its characters (that bar scene is incredibly stupid) and laughable drama. The plot is incredibly rushed and doesn't make any sense if you take the time to think about it, the editing is a disaster, the soundtrack is overstuffed (anyone can throw 20 great songs in a film, but that doesn't make for a great soundtrack if the choices are random and awkwardly placed. It was the sense of perfectly fitting into the scene what made the ""Watchmen"" soundtrack so damn good, and that doesn't happen here).The characters, with a couple of alright exceptions (a great Harley Quinn that nevertheless gets stabbed by the incompetence of the screenwriters during the third act, a barely decent Deadshot whose choices near the end, as Harley's, don't make much sense, and a cold and Machiavellian Amanda Waller), are bland as hell. Katana has a great physical design, but she's nothing but a wordless minion. And she's not even the worst of the bunch. The Enchantress is terribly explained and her motivations are completely out of place. Boomerang just walks by every now and then, with no development at all, changing his allegiances every five minutes. Killer Croc does nothing. Rick Flag is useless. The Joker isn't terrible, but he isn't good either. Yeah, he's mildly entertaining, and I get that Leto needed to try something desperately different, but he's neither funny nor intimidating. He's the Joker in name only. And of course, there's the third act, which is a freaking travesty full of cringe-worthy dialogue, bad writing, characters that constantly betray themselves to serve a happy-ending-in-a-Hollywood-style purpose and poor action sequences.So, to sum up: F**k you, David Ayer. You took a concept with incredible potential and delivered the worst comic book movie of the year. I can't find the words to express how extremely disappointed I am. Please, someone save the DCEU, because this is the third strike, and these movies keep getting worse and worse. I don't trust Wonder Woman at this point. How could I?Rating: 4,5/10PD: Does anyone dies in a helicopter crash in this f**king universe?",Suicide Squad
1616,Chiyaki,Bad meets Evil? Hell no!,4,7 August 2016,"So many things have been said by so many people, critics or not. To make it short, I think this movie could be improved by removing: 1.Katana (her talking to her sword is quite humorous) 2. Batman (hm. how can he complete Joker if Joker himself isn't needed in the movie in the first place?) 3. Slipknot (his contribution to the bomb test is appreciated anyway) 4. Boomerang (why do they need a thief in the first place?) 5. Killer Croc (thanks for the charisma you add to the squad but a Beauty and the Beast suits you better)6.Joker (his final scene can stay though) 7. El Diablo's every ""I-won't-harm-people"" dialog and flashbacks and the ""I-gotta-protect-my- new-family"" clichéNow you've got somewhat cooler squad than Sailormoon and friends!",Suicide Squad
1617,LieneMik,Short & spoiler free review by a casual viewer,6,3 August 2016,"Disclaimer: I haven't read any of the comics, I just enjoy superhero (in this case - villain) movies. So I can't compare these characters to the original ones.Pros of this movie:1.The visual effects are amazing 2.The soundtrack is great 3.The movie is fun 4.The action sequences are great 5.I liked almost all of the characters (on the ones I didn't - scroll down) 6.Leto is a good Joker. He is different, but I really liked him. I'm glad he was only in the movie for a short while. It's all I needed - I can't wait to see him in future DC films! 7.Good female characters. Sure, Harley could've used a bit more practical clothing, but I honestly didn't feel like she was over sexualized. She's sexy and she knows it and uses it to get a reaction out of people. This movie gives us multiple badass female characters, each different from the other, so why not add someone like this Harley in the mix? Cons of this movie: 1.Slipknot. How did that actor agree to do this movie lmao 2.Enchantress. Boring and unbelievable. 3.The Villain. The usual villain we get in superhero movies. Almost bluefaced and kinda robotic + pretty boring. 4.The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times and some of the characters' reactions seem unrealistic 5.The ending's lameIn conclusion - more than anything the movie's fun. And it made me excited for what else DC has to offer. So I do recommend watching it, just don't expect to be mindblown.",Suicide Squad
1618,darkalo84,Y I did like Suicide Squad despite not being a masterpiece,8,1 November 2019,"I liked Suicide Squad (only the extended cut) despite some issues here and there.I must say that I have never read a Suicide Squad comic book but I have seen almost every DC's TV show or movie ever made: the old Superman movies, the Batman animated series, Lois & Clark, The Dark Knight, etc, etc.
What I have also done is reading 'Suicide Squad: behind the scenes with the worst heroes ever'. This book helped me better understand David Ayer's motivation for his script and the characters. I think he has largely been misunderstood by hardcore fans who can't really relate to his version of the property. And I do understand why.This a modern take on most of the characters like Leto's Joker. As Ayer put it: ""he's a 21st century villain with an iPhone"". And as for the story it is pretty much as good/interesting or as bad/senseles as any other one from almost every DC or Marvel superhero flick made to this day. From the likes of the first Thor or The Incredible Hulk up to more recent outings like Age of Ultron or Shazam!.
Do you really think the motivations behind Enchantress' actions are poorer or thinner than those of Red Skull or Dr. Sivana for example. Really? Really???
This is comic book material and villains in comic books tend to have the weirdests and flimsiest of excuses for their actions to begin with.
I did notice the film was given a more colourful and blockbuster look by producers than that of Ayer's original idea. They wanted more fun added to the movie and the result suffers from this. I guess they achieved this through more one-liners, the neon colouring and the (otherwise great) pop music.
Nevertheless I also hoped for more character development but I understood that couldn't have been possible with so many characters in a feature clicking on the 2 hour run-time.
On the whole I wished they had more time to develop their motivations and the whole plot. I would have added another 20 min. to the extended version just to fill those gaps/holes. But the studio didn't want a theatrical 150 min-long film and the result.... is this.On the other hand, I can't understand some people comalqining of things they do not usually complain about with the likes of Marvel feature films. It is like they are pouring hate for the sake of throwing out hate. If you watch the movie carefully most complaints are found to be false or tainted. Just one example: June finds the statuette of Enchantress and people say it is quite unrealistic for a real scientist to have opened the urn/statuette in the first place. But if you've seen the movie you can clearly notice how June is sort of bewitched and gets entranced by the statuette and so she kind of feels and irresistible urge to open it.
The same goes for some many other things but... anyway. This is just my opinion.",Suicide Squad
1619,DarkTurnip,"Good acting, bad script.",7,13 August 2016,"The movie has such a great cast, but the script lets it down. I really wanted to like Suicide Squad. I've been looking forward to it for a very long time. After finally seeing it, I feel quite disappointed. The actors do a great job and they make this very watchable. The dialogue is somewhat cringy at times and I wish they had spent a bit more time building the characters. Perhaps doing a couple of films showing their back stories would have been better. Really enjoyed seeing Jared Leto as the joker, would have loved it if they hadn't put almost all of his dialogue in the trailer. The funny bits in the film seemed to fall flat on the audience tonight. A couple of giggles here and there, but mostly very predictable humour. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Harley Quinn. Will Smith is great as Deadshot. Add a good Joker and you have the makings of an amazing movie. Really don't know how it still fell flat and didn't hit the spot. Shame about the effort from the actors. The studio seems to be rushing to get to the Justice League at the cost of quality.",Suicide Squad
1620,ianferrell08,Worst editing ever,4,4 August 2016,"This was a pretty movie, but unlike still photographs, movies must have story that takes place over a period of time. The editors seemed to ignore that. The obviousness of the re-edit after BvS's critical failure is so blatant that the story is incomprehensible. We're talking day turning to night turning to day, a la Plan 9 from Outer Space. The acting is pretty good, especially from Margot Robbie. And I love the ""gangster/mobster"" Joker. But people, there's got to be a story. Inserting jokes to ""lighten the mood"" only works if the jokes are an integral part of the character, and the jokes are timed well. Plot events have to be shown, if not in actual chronological order, then at least in a way that makes sense to the audience. This movie was pieced together with old wood glue and some duct tape. Again, the music was cool (although sometimes unnecessary), Margot Robbie's great and gorgeous, and there were other positive aspects. But these are the preetty face of a poorly-executed film. Save time and money and skip this one.",Suicide Squad
1621,sexycrackass,If you've read the comics stay away.,4,5 April 2017,"While I understand the general trend with Comic Book Movies that they are just action and one-liners that is totally true here. I have high hopes while being a massive fan of a lot of characters in the film.I have to say that not everything I say about the film will be negative as there are always positives such as Jared Leto played a great character that just never really felt like the Joker. Also Robbie as Quinn was superb.Killer Croc came across as very ghetto (I know he was coloured but he never came across as ghetto in the comics, ever) Also why was Killer Croc even selected? He's in King Shark places (but honestly that never really bothered me, I love Killer Croc)While Will Smith is still one of my favourite actors his portrayal of Deadshot leaves a lot to be desired. Can't really go into the plot as you know it all already, World is in danger someone needs to save it. Character development does happen but there's not a lot to work with.While I found this a slap in the face I am sure those that haven't read the Comics or have little to no knowledge of the characters should find this passable or maybe even better.",Suicide Squad
1622,kanwar-kalsi,"Don't listen to critics or anyone else, see for yourself",9,2 August 2016,"To all those who prefer a dark tone in movies with some humor, this one would not disappoint. I still don't understand why so much hate from critics again. Are they trying to stop DC from making movies; if that's the case that ain't going to stop. I loved both MOS & BVS, this one is also kick-ass. Packed with lots of action sequences and humor and cameos, its an absolute fun movie. Yes, it does have a different approach than BVS but both are great in their own ways. David Ayer as the director was so cool. Soundtrack and Score was awesome. Now speaking of the performances, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is jaw dropping. She alone is the reason enough to watch this film. Will Smith is just fantastic. Jared Leto made another iconic Joker performance but he should've had more screen time. Leto's joker is good but not better than Heath's as set up a high bar in terms of performance. Amanda Waller was a mean scary agent and that's a good point as it was needed to bring the bad guys together.Batfleck is always fun to watch. The Flash cameo was cool too.Killer Croc, El Diablo, Rick Flag, Katana, Cap Boomerang; all were good. And Slipknot - why was he there even in the first place??? And as it goes for the critics, Rick Flag's got a few words ""seriously, what the hell is wrong with you people?"" - to which their answer is ""we're the worse guys, we rate DC movies as BAD"".... SERIOUSLY!Overall: the movie is good. Could've had more run time as its an hour less than BVS ultimate cut, and some more joker in it but its still a fun watch anyways. Definitely recommended.",Suicide Squad
1623,Sonofnyx,Just another super-hero movie...,7,6 August 2016,"Sooo...I just came back from the cinema where I watched this movie. My first quick impressions are:1. I never want to see this Joker. Please, don't make a film where he will be the main character. I honestly was glad when the helicopter crashed and he ""died"", thinking that my ordeal was over (unfortunately, I was wrong). I liked Jared in other films and I think he's a great actor (and musician), but for this role it seemed he kind of overacted.2. Margot Robbie and Will Smith saved the film. They seemed natural in their character and they succeeded in making me care about their character. 3. Some scenes didn't feel good at all (ex. the moment when Harley breaks a display window to take the purse - felt like that scene was randomly placed there).Overall, the movie was entertaining (with some good jokes slipped here and there), while having its flaws. Definitely not the best film of the year, but it deserves a view.",Suicide Squad

This movie is a fun watch and definitely an improvement over BVS. In no way it's perfect movie, however, you can't hit the Bulls eye always. The whole purpose of this movie is to build a greater DCEU and the squad does its task with finesse. The best thing about the movie was people were having fun in the theater. Will Smith is a gem of an actor and Harley runs the show here. Other than that Amanda Waller, Rick Flag and Diablo was really really good. Also the music was really good and I am surely buying the soundtrack as well.Go, have yourself a fun evening.",Suicide Squad
1625,madrex2001,Suicide Squad is fun and the action keeps coming!,10,6 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a great next step in the new DCEU. While it may not be a perfect film overall, there is so much fan service and truly incredible acting, that I really liked it! Ben as Batman was great to see again of course, and the film has a great take on the Joker & Harley relationship! Its a delight when the film dives into these areas and it feels very natural. I do with that WB had not jumped in and edited the film so much. We know that they filmed so much with the Joker and its just left on the cutting room floor. While I know its not a Joker movie, it is a Harley Quinn movie, and it would serve to help us get to know her character even more to see these scenes! Will Smith brought his A-Game as Deadshot too! He was funny, and had some nice dramatic moments throughout the picture. Overall its probably an 8.5/10 for me. Id recommend seeing this. Its fun and the action keeps coming!",Suicide Squad
1626,englishkinsella,I had fun,6,7 August 2016,"Let's get this out of the way: much like Ghostbusters before it, this was a good movie but not great enough to quiet the haters from BvS.That said, I had fun with this movie which is something I can't say I did in the previous DCEU outing. This movie was fun and it didn't feel like a Marvel movie proving that DC can still do it's dark thing while still finding hope and a little humor (mainly dark humor) in its stories.This movie was good, but not great. I feel the story was something that belonged in a second or third movie. With (spoiler) Enchantress as the big bad, her powers and how she worked to tear down the villains didn't really hit home with me. Harley wanting to have a normal family life with her Puddin felt really strange after watching her kill without remorse for the previous hour+. The only one that felt real was Deadshot wanting to kill the Bat.Deadshot and Harley are easily the two standouts. The other characters had moments and Slipknot was used exactly how he should have been, but no one was really as special as Deadshot and Harley. Both of their arcs had solid beginnings, middles, and ends with Deadshot looking like he could reform and Harley showing that she just wants to belong.The Joker was fine for what he had. I feel like he would have been a better bigger bad for this movie as he has an established movie base and the team toppling him would have had a bigger impact, for me anyways. Leto was fine but I'm going to wait until I see a bigger role before I pass judgment.All in all, this movie was a move in the right direction for DCEU. It was good but not great but I think it showed that DCEU can be dark but still find moments of humor and hope in their stories. If nothing else, it has gotten me excited for Ezra Miller's Flash (he had a five second cameo and it was great).",Suicide Squad
1627,HBKTimHBK,What a great popcorn flick!,9,5 August 2016,"I really had a great time with this movie! It may not have been absolutely perfect, but I thought it was a really good time. Besides, I don't need a perfect movie, I just wanted a fun time and I found one. The cast was great, I thought they had a very natural chemistry with one another and I totally bought it. I know that people have a huge issue with the third act and I understand it, but there was something about them all fighting together that really sold me as well, I really loved all of the action in the movie. It felt like as close to a cohesive unit as possible within the context of the movie. It was a really good ensemble movie with good action, I laughed quite a bit, and am looking forward to seeing the movie again.Also, personally as someone who really loves Harley Quinn I am beyond happy that her live action debut was as pitch perfect as this was. Margot Robbie was incredible, as was Will Smith and Viola Davis.",Suicide Squad
1628,Debank-dc,Disturbingly pathetic,1,1 September 2016,"I have watched tons of movies,both good and bad but I never felt as strongly to review a movie. I judge only the user reviews on IMDb,as there are several movies with a below average rating, but the user reviews were good and it actually turned out to be good. This movie seriously doesn't deserve the current 6.8 star rating. I fast forwarded through the movie, and even then my head is aching. I am not a Marvel fanboy or whatsoever,I enjoy good movies and I don't care which universe it belongs to. Movies like this makes you appreciate how good is Captain America: Civil war. I have watched few animated justice league movies, and those had a strong story line. This one has nothing. Even the episode on ""Suicide squad"" in the series Arrow , had better chemistry amongst the bad guys. I thought Batman V Superman was funny, but this one is plain ridiculous. No real plot, no real dialogues, no real action. I seriously don't know how can anyone having a sound mind enjoy this movie. I couldn't agree more with the person who commented on the distribution of power in the suicide squad.Captain Boomerang had almost zero action and it was pathetic to imagine Captain Boomerang and Harley Quinn fighting those ancient magical whatsoever! And lastly, it actually pains me to see how they have ruined the Joker. I am a big fan of Jared Leto(Mr.Nobody) and I really wish that he had a director like Nolan. He could've done wonders if the script had supported him. Crazy for the sake of being crazy; Joker is reduced to a mere caricature. Recommend: do not watch, if you ever think of yourself as one with a good taste in movies.",Suicide Squad
1629,The-Road-Warrior-96,"Worst heroes ever? More like ""worst movie ever""!",2,5 August 2016,"The best thing I can say about this film is that I didn't pay for it. Seriously, what a miserable experience watching this film was, and all the ultimately prevailed was feeling really sorry for the cast that despite their dedicated efforts, the movie just turned out to be completely unwatchable. Keep in mind, for the rest of the review, however, my thoughts on the films in this genre are notoriously unpopular on this board. I loved Batman v Superman and thought Civil War was complete garbage. I am getting tired of this genre, so perhaps that has something to do with it. The story here is pretty generic stuff. The final act is almost as bad as that of Ghostbusters, and the film was just as dull as Civil War. The only real saving grace was Margot Robbie, who gave the film her all, and of course also her undeniable sex appeal. Will Smith provides a very generic arc that, for fans of the TV show Arrow, we have already seen (and performed with more humanity). That show clearly isn't amazing and Season 4 is one of the worst seasons I've seen in a TV series ever, but the Deadshot in seasons 1 and 2 I found much easier to connect to. This was simply Will Smith playing Will Smith with a gun, and the character simply lacks edge. That same idea echoes throughout the film - it is so blunt and flat, with nothing of note occurring. Leto's performance is just pathetic. It is humiliating. From the outset I knew he was the wrong casting choice, and the movie proves me right beyond any reasonable doubt. His performance the whole time just misses the mark drastically. This fails to capture the essence of the Joker, and also fails to craft a compelling standalone character as Jesse Eisenberg managed to do with Lex Luthor. Here the character is reimagined as more of a drug-addled hardcore crime lord. It just doesn't work, and it is tragic to think the lengths Leto went to in his method acting to deliver what is ultimately such a tame, lame, and forgettable performance. I do hope they recast him for Batman's standalone film - him as the lead villain instantaneously knocks the film down to a maximum score of around 7/10. Thankfully he is barely in the film, although it bodes poorly for the future films in this saga. I don't think Deadpool was amazing, but it pulled off the edgier superhero film much better than this. Here it is simply grim and mean-spirited, as opposed to being cool in any vague way. This feels like a film more along those lines that was made as a dark, gritty, intense, and just completely insane action film that was later cut into a generic crowd pleaser. David Ayer claims this is his complete vision, in which case I don't know how he was ever hired, and why the making of this film is said to have been so dark and intense. The villain would be forgettable even by the standards of the MCU films. This film is so bad it feels like a failed MCU film, completely missing any distinguishing style. All we get is a muddled mess. Why not just have the Joker as villain? At least that would have been a somewhat interesting failure by the iconic nature of the character. Who cares about the Enchantress and the CGI rubbish in the finale? Overall this film was boring, tonally jarring, mean-spirited, bland, atrociously made, with editing that is amongst the most incompetent I have seen in a large budget film. Really just a complete mess. I hated this film, and it completely betrays what (to me) made BvS a memorable film in the genre. The DC universe appears to have given up trying to stand on its own and simply follow the MCU model, and attempted to make an MCU film. The story is incoherent and frankly garbage, the characters outside of Margot Robbie suck, the action is some of the weakest I've seen in a while, so blandly choreographed and just uninteresting. It is ridiculous but not self-aware enough of how ridiculous it is. It just isn't even vaguely similar to what made the trailers somewhat appealing. Recommended ONLY if you have someone who raped your girlfriend, murdered your parents, ate your dog, stole all your money, cut off all your limbs, and nuked the world, this might be an adequate way to get them back - make them sit through this film. I've called the critics biased before, and that is a sentiment I maintain entirely, although they are 100% right here, particularly Travers who nailed it. Stay away. You have been warned. 1/10.",Suicide Squad
1630,NicoleMae12203,What is DC really trying to do? (A Rant),7,15 August 2016,"Like many who have also spent their money to see Suicide Squad despite hearing not-so-great reviews, I decided to keep an open mind and stay optimistic. And well... I wanted to leave halfway through the film.SPOILERS.By the end of the character introduction, which I don't think should have been placed at the beginning like that as some expositional ploy to get to the action, I was already disappointed. As a viewer, you could kind of tell that they gave WAY more screen time to Deadshot and Harley Quinn just because they were Will Smith and Margot Robbie, respectively. I wanted to know more about the OTHER characters as well because they had just as much potential in terms of power capabilities and back stories to carry this movie. Don't get me wrong, Smith and Robbie did great at executing their parts. But just as well, I believe that the other actors could have shared the screen time with similarly great executions. I mean, at many times I did not get the sense that Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc were even part of the Suicide Squad. Rather, they just felt like dummies who were added for light-heartedness (Boomerang) and to give the audience an insecure person who 'becomes' confident at the end (Croc) for character development satisfaction. Also, if they had eliminated the military (and probably even Katana, who, let's face it, did not even need to be there), the movie could have focused so much more on the bonding of the team and how they even transcend their wicked ways to do something good then probably go back to being wicked to escape their way out of Amanda Waller's control. Instead, I felt like Rick Flag was the main character! Moreover, the Joker and the Enchantress (with her strange dancing) have bigger identity crises than they let on. Like who was the villain? They obviously had different evil agendas (kind of? Not really I guess because the Joker just spent most of his time being with and then saving Harley). In the trailers, it looked like the Joker was the villain, but I was so shocked to find out that it was the Enchantress!! WHY? WHY? She could have been a great addition to the team. In fact, she could have formed a great bond with El Diablo, who shares the same fate of being 'cursed' with a power and does not wish to harness its evil potential anymore. Maybe they could have even added a plot for them trying to find a way to get out of their powers, and El Diablo, who is accepting of the consequences of his actions helps the Enchantress overcome her fear of hurting others and suppress the evil inside of her. SOMETHING that gives meaning to doing a movie about the BAD guys.Instead, I felt like they used 'bad' characters to 'do something different' so that they could stray from the sometimes righteously good tones of Marvel but they really did not know how to do that and just copied the typical superhero plot of forming a team with characters we all know and love to get rid of the bad guy. And just because the Suicide Squad so happens to be the bad guys, they should just end it by putting them in jail...because they're the bad guys.Despite all my ranting, I did feel something from the movie. Like when the team felt pity for El Diablo at the bar and how Deadshot really misses and loves his daughter but compromises seeing her just to save Harley. THOSE kinds of moments, the ones that show that we, the audience, are maybe like the villains too or that they are worth giving a chance should have been the biggest advantage of whatever this world DC is trying to set up.Instead, I feel like DC is riding this superhero wave and that they are okay with whatever happens just as long as they get to make money. Well, guess what. DC Comics superheroes should be at the HELM of this wave because their characters have been the epitome of superhero images and many of them are the original superheroes. But I think that DC maybe knows that and the fact that they have had flops with the lighter Superman movies and successes with the darker Batman trilogy have led them to believe that it is the darker tone that people want out of their world. It's not. It's great storytelling and really showing people how DC characters are relatable because their heroes are much more powerful than Marvel's superheroes.If you can't tell already, I'm a bit cynical of the recent and future DC films because I feel like there is this overarching need to compensate for their losses made by Marvel, whose direction in movies has built long-term investments by creating a truly immersive world to explore on film. DC films have so much potential, ESPECIALLY by making Suicide Squad, which would have at least related to the success of grim the Batman trilogy. But I think that if DC focuses on itself and what kind of message it needs to leave with the audience, then they will definitely deserve the praise and respect of its super/antiheroes.(Also, I just realized this, but I think that the roots of the comic universes may also be a source of their conflict because the company that distributes DC films is Warner Bros. and the company that mainly distributes Marvel films is Disney. The two men who created Warner Bros. Animation were originally from Disney and left because of some bad blood at the time...so yeah, maybe it carried on?)",Suicide Squad
1631,notenoughforcomedy,Quite disappointed,6,17 August 2016,"It's such a shame that they got all these good actors but still cannot bring out all the good in them. Margot Robbie and Viola Davis are the only ones in this movie that keeps me awake, maybe Will Smith helps a little. But all other cast members didn't seem to pull off their characters. Especially Jared Leto as the joker. He's a very skillful actor I must say. But I don't think he fits quite right for the role, or maybe the movie didn't quite give him a chance cause he didn't make it into lots of scenes like others. The movie wasn't that bad overall. It is still entertaining to some point. But the plot is pretty terrible. There are so many loopholes in it and it doesn't really make sense in some scenes. The first few scenes when the movie introduced the characters are interesting but then it went downhill after that. It wasn't what I was expecting when I first saw the trailer.",Suicide Squad
1632,SkyGirlx3,"Very Disappointed, this review comes from DC fan. Rating it pg13 was a mistake",4,4 August 2016,"***Pros*** : Will Smith, Viola Davis and Jared Leto saved this movie. Each Joker & Harley scene together was amazing. also, i absolutely loved the easter eggs!***Cons*** :*1. There was always music playing during the movie! And most of the music wasn't even related to the scenes, it didn't go together very well. *2. The editing was bad & it was confusing to watch.*3. I'm a huge fan of Margot Robbie but she was trying too hard. *4. The lines were lame *5.Cara Delevingne's performance was the worst & her plot was pointless and boring, she needs to quit from acting and stick to modeling.*6.So in this movie, suicide squad member's just met, they know each other for a couple of hours and they already call each other ""friends"", they made them look like they are the bad guys who are trying to change and become good - this ruined the movie. I guess they thought that we would not relate to them if they stayed bad. Well guess what, they could be likable without all the heroism thing.*7.They did a mistake with rating it PG13. What bothered me the most was Harley. I mean she thought that her puddin' is dead and gone forever, she cried over him for two minutes and moved on, that's not like her at all. She's more extreme than that. She should have went nuts and try to kill everyone because her pudding is dead. I guess they couldn't show how crazy she really is because this movie is rated pg13. Also, she had the chance to bring her puddin' back to life (at the time no one knew that he was still alive) she could bring him back to life if she agreed to work for the enchantress, instead - she chose her ""friends"" over the biggest love of her life (joker) that doesn't make any sense. they couldn't show the abusive relationship in a pg13 movie.*8. Story telling was confusing and rushed. ""Well they cant do flashback scenes for hours to introduce each character"" which brings me to the next problem:*9. Pointless action scenes. They were shooting and playing with guns for at least 40 minutes. They could save these 40 minutes for proper story telling.DC can make up for this disaster by creating a joker/harley solo movie.",Suicide Squad
1633,willprot,A bad movie with very good parts... the 1970's special effects is not one of them,4,17 January 2018,"This movie had such great potential that it is a shame that it falls so flat. First, the good. Floyd Lawton/Deadshot (Will Smith) has a story line that is actually compelling and interesting, one in which you want to know more about, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is also a very well acted, entertaining and interesting character, and finally the most interesting, diverse, and entertaining character in the entire movie Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) a character that could perhaps carry a movie on her own.The most entertaining and interesting scenes come from when those characters are involved and you get a sense that if they were to tell an actual story it would be a great movie but it doesn't and of course the movie is not solely based on them.Unfortunately beyond those three characters you have the rest of the movie... where to begin.You have Boomerang who is a terrible choice for the Suicide Squad as he didn't or couldn't add much to the movie, just a dose of bad comedy. Then there's Diablo a character that they did spend time on special effects to make his fire powers look fanciful, but not much else, he isn't at all a compelling character or one that you are ever vested in. And then the throw away characters Slipknot, his entire inclusion is to show the lengths Waller would go to... but it is so absolutely poorly executed to make his inclusion laughable.And finally the terrible...The Joker is reduce to a tattooed thug instead megalomaniacal genius, one word. Awful.Killer Croc an utterly terrifying character in the DC universe is an utter joke in this movie used for comic relief. He looks like a normal guy in a poorly designed Halloween costume. The Flash TV show also set in the DC universe had a similar character named King Shark, they created him in CGI to show off his imposing stature and terrifying nature, but here in a big budget movie they painted a guy green, like the 1970's Hulk, with a big head and skinny arms, this is the worst of the worse.And this is all culminated by the fact that the main antagonist of the film in truth is something the Suicide Squad would not be capable of handling, but shoehorned in to try an make an entertaining premise, this instead makes the entire movie feel false and uninteresting and in the end just makes for very bad storytelling.With the way the ""enemy"" is handled you wouldn't even have needed any type of ""suicide squad"", just the National Guard or someone like that, but they obviously didn't know who to write or create and interesting antagonist or story and no matter what good points you have, without that you have nothing.At this point, they are stuck with the foundation they've built so there is little hope for any sequels but perhaps in the future they will focus on the good points and try to create more interesting stories, for now Suicide Squad is a movie you can pass on for something more watchable.",Suicide Squad

Having been looking forward to this (from the trailers) then not looking forward after seeing the initial reviews I went into the cinema fearing the worst. And I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. It's not the greatest super hero movie ever made but it's still good, enjoyable and certainly worth making the effort to go see. I do tend to agree with some of the comments made, especially about the amount of screen time that they give to the Joker.

He is a one dimensional cater. Movie didn't make any sense, the lame as corny fans who liked it and were waiting for it are retarded. I don't write reviews but i'm tired of people saying the movie for good. If you are corny then yes maybe its good. I can say one good thing, the joker was the best joker ever played. I grew up watching all the Batmans and he was the best what I wanted to see in a joker. He reminded me of the joker from Batman: the animated series. I get tired of people saying Health Ledger was the best Joker. Since when the Joker is depressing and dark. Then the stupid as makeup on his face ruined it. I didn't laugh not one time watching the dark knight with him playing the joker. Now to Jared Leto did a good job and I would like to see him in more roles as the joker. He had that sadistic, funny, psycho feeling as should the joker should be. One thing is that we wasn't crazy enough. The joker suppose to be a lunatic.",Suicide Squad

Most of us go to the movies for the first. SUICIDE SQUAD is for you. This is an action extravaganza, full of popcorn munching fun, explosions, and fight scenes. All the actors play their parts well, but Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as the Joker are particularly good. Could there be more plot? Yes, but its a super- villain turned heroes flick----gather the team, beat the bad guy, save the world---. Harley Quinn does crazy REALLY well. Jared Leto is a Joker we've not seen before. He's not making a point to anyone, he is just doing his own (totally psychotic) thing. The soundtrack crushes with lots of classic rock, and there are few dull moments. I hope we'll see more Suicide Squads in the future, but I would totally be down for a Joker/Harley movie with Leto and Robbie. One last point. Its really sad to see reviewers, and by this I mean so called professionals, carry over their personal political/social/moral biases over into the treatment of a movie. This is particularly obvious in the case of Suicide Squad. One reviewer seemed particularly put off by Harley's short shorts. Really? If this bothers you, go watch Beaches again.",Suicide Squad

It is 2016, it's not cool acting ''cool'' with the slow mo walk etc.. it's funny in a bad sad way. and what annoyed me most was the total RIP OFF of DIE ANTWOORD's style!

1641,sone-itf,Suicide Squad - Review,5,1 December 2016,"MINOR SPOILERS !!!Really, really disappointing film for me, for couple of reasons. First off, I want to say that I am not a huge DC or Marvel fan, but I do have some basic knowledge about this characters and think that non of them was done justly in the film. Deadshot was just OK, and a huge opportunity was wasted with Harley Quinn, because they cared more about Margot Robbie ass then the actual character, and the rest were there to fill the void especially Captain Boomerang. The action scenes were kind a boring, again potential of main cast was not used. The plot is really week because film does not know what it wants to be, the Joker story or alien invasion story or love story or bromance story. The best part of the film for me were flashback and character introduction in the beginning, and Batman being there was good. Was expecting fun action film with a few jokes, and I got one big mess, maybe in the future the writers could think something better and more interesting.Final verdict 5/10, just skip it.",Suicide Squad
1642,chandu-devilindisguise,Third Trial Trying To Get Things Straight,6,5 August 2016,"In the third installment of DC trying to build a universe of their own, they commit yet another mistake of choosing a good director but poor screenplay and mediocre dialogue writing and execution. It has equal portions of comedy, action, audio and visual elements tied together which build up the excitement for the first half of the movie and get you to the edge of your seats by the end, of course for the exactly opposite reason. #Yawns That's exactly what happened when a movie like Exodus that started and ran with low expectations, ended with a Tsunami that washed away everyone except the protagonist and antagonist.All the characters were unnecessarily introduced for too long and each back story has something that doesn't leave you a lot impacted when you see them fight the bad guys. Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker can still not be judged or misjudged because his screen time as Joker was smaller than all the movie's trailers put together. And I am still not sure why Bruce Wayne wants to just hand over criminals to the police but didn't wanna show up when monsters from another world want to destroy the world. That is exactly what they wanted to correct after Man of Steel and have committed the same mistake again.Writers haven't spent much time on focusing what Amanda Waller has hired the squad for, instead they keep digging into the stories of each person that aren't essential to the mission. Due to lack of screen- time, all the characters have been under utilized. Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is DC's best decision after choosing Ben Affeck as Batman.Unlike Winter Solder where Nick Fury asks Cap not to trust anyone due to which he didn't call for help, there is no specific reason what shows why Princess Diana, Barry Allen or Batman show up in the current time line to stop a monster that is casting a spell on civilians and burning them to death and a Hybrid monster brother who has been destroying pretty much everything. It is good as a standalone comic book that you finish reading and put it back to your shelf but doesn't leave you excited for the bigger DCCU that is going to get characters Brainiac and Darkseid in the movies to come.",Suicide Squad
1643,developcrs,A typical case of the trailer being better than the movie. Period.,4,7 February 2017,"After having watched the trailer, I felt excited to watch the movie as the trailer promised a comedy movie x just a little bit of drama x lots of action x a well structured plot. After months of waiting, however, I sat down to watch the movie and I can't express how disappointed I was.It appears as if film makers and editors put all the best bits of a film in the trailer, including all the funniest jokes and most comical scenes. The rest of the movie did not live up to the standard set by the trailer as I was watching a movie with a poorly constructed plot, unrealistic scenes (diablo in the end, Enchantress and her slave ""brother"", the ""unexpected"" killing of enchantress by Harley). What a joke. Combine low-level thinking with a desperate attempt to outshine ""Deadpool"" and you will end up with Suicide Squad. Sorry guys, not impressed. I was bored throughout the movie and was desperate for it to stop, but deep down inside I was still hoping for a solid resolution of the movie or the introduction of a ""secret"" character, or at least something to bring life back to the movie.",Suicide Squad
1644,henrycat125,Leto and Robbie/Joker and Harley,10,16 August 2016,"I actually liked the Suicide Squad version of both. Other than the single cringey ""the voices didn't really say that"" scene, Robbie did a good job and was likable and funny. And Leto was a hell of a lot closer to the source material than Ledger. Leto's Joker was a little too ""gangsta"", but take that away and he had the look, darkness and obsession of a lot of newer comic book issue Jokers (yes the Joker has been ripped and pretty good looking in a lot of them, so no it's not weird nor inaccurate.)Yeah their relationship was a little bit too fluffy, but I think that's only because the movie it's self couldn't show massive amounts of abuse with out losing audience. But, if you've read the comics and watched the cartoons, it's also not unrealistic that they would be like this with each other. Basically if the movie had been able to add him bashing her around a few times (and kept everything else the same), it would have been spot on. I give it a solid 7/10, and most of that being the director's fault for their roles, and an 8/10 over all.",Suicide Squad
1645,MrMovieMe,"A bad movie, a masterpiece when it comes to defining characters",6,15 June 2017,"This is not a good movie, the pacing feels like one long trailer and the movie overall is quite lame.But what this movie does give you: is a masterpiece when defining characters.The story was not built in the right way, but the movie did do something; it took these characters and made them in a phenomenon, ready to reappear in more DC movies along the way.The costume, make up and hair styling teams did a great job, bringing in new iconic looks to the characters.Casting was another positive point about this movie.A lot has been said about the Joker, and I don't know if the world was ready for a new Joker after Heath Ledger's performance. The choice made with bringing this new rendition of the so known and loved character will be a win for them in future movies. While we haven't seen much of him, I think Leto's Joker will grow on us overtime. They needed to redefine the Joker; as you simple can not compete will Ledger's magnetic performance.",Suicide Squad
1646,gastonventu88,Insulting,1,2 September 2016,"I find it insulting. We are being under-appreciated with this kind of film, when all of the budget goes to the characters and the production, and they just throw a dime on the script and storyline. Simply nonsense. I've been waiting a long time, only to watch a spoiled opportunity to make something unique. Even the over acting of Jared Leto as the joker, an actor that i've always loved, but here he tries so hard to make something different than his predecessors that he ends up making something that is not different than a regular gangster, with no presence and not timeless at all. Im sorry for my English, but i needed to tell this to the world, because the film is awful",Suicide Squad

Movie contains little- bit of a back story of all characters so you can understand why our worst heroes are in a prison.First half was little slow but I think it was necessary for building a plot.All guest stars are amazing like Flash, and of course The Batman.Will Smith as a Deadshot was great.Captain Boomerang character was funny as similar in comics.Strongest point of this movie is Harley.She will make you lough in the entire movie. Now,I would like to say about the Joker. Of course Jared was great,he did a terrific job with his acting as the Joker but his lough,the Joker's lough was weird.But overall the movie is great.All comic book lovers will enjoy it.",Suicide Squad
1648,TheseAreORScrubs,True Review. No Bias. No Bulls***,6,3 August 2016,"Firstly I am one of the many fans out there who have been waiting for 18 months now to finally see this flick.I tried, tried then tried some more to not read the reviews yesterday but it was to no avail.Although i always go in fresh my heart sunk at the total negative reviews.NOW Don't THINK ""THIS GUY IS MARVEL"". I am and have always been DC but this is yet another attempt to make a DC movie using a director that just isn't built for an epic Nolan type filmWe saw a midnight screening last night here in Australia. The first 20 minutes were entertaining in warming you up to the characters however the overuse of songs were a real distraction. Seemed every camera change had another song playing. Unlike Guardians though this soundtrack had no continuity. From 70's disco to 80's rock ballads to white boy rap..... and this was all in the space of 2 minutes!!!As the 2nd act started i thought to myself the movie is rather good however my fears did arrive very quickly.We found ourselves asking each other ""did we miss something??"".There was no information given to the audience as to where our SS were going and what their goal was. After a drawn out repetitive fight scene we understand the goal once finally told to us.There seemed to be no second act as we realized this film completely skips it and goes straight from act 1 to an act 3 which drags on and on.I cannot understand how a movie with so many executives could allow this to happen with the amount of editing time this film had.I guess they thought ""lets just take the audience's money and try and improve on the next one""The plot and story were either not there to begin with or cut out in editing.It was fun but also a little too corny for my liking with only Will and Margot having a few shine moments and the Joker just laughing a lot when i guess Leto couldn't figure out how to act a certain scene.I am re-watching this afternoon to see if i missed anything however from talking to the mates I unfortunately have to agree with most of the critics reviews.",Suicide Squad
1649,dnlbdnrk,"uninspired, boring with no interesting characters",1,6 August 2016,"there is a bunch of characters with great potential and stories that could be enough for 3 movies. instead we get a very strangely paced flick where none of these characters comes across as likable or seems to be more than an a stereotype. copy-pasted.my favorite is actually the bad black lady... as opposed to Will Smith who's playing himself and the crazy lady who's only around because of boobs. the rest of the cast is pretty unremarkable, the human aztec torch, lizard from the spider man movie, a Japanese lady and an crocodile dundee have to fight a lady with a strange accent. none of them is able to connect to the audience in any way.the sorceress is building her machine to destroy humanity for two thirds of the movie while the squad is wandering through debris where the individual members can find out for us and themselves that they actually aren't so bad after all because LOVE... and thereby quickly become a new and happy family.the fights are as bland as the jokes and the generic face- and bloodless bad guys. the soundtrack turns the movie into an overlong music video but at least many of the songs are good. not sure if the young people to which this movie is catering towards will know all the song but then, maybe they get to appreciate Bob Dylan. so after watching this for a while the music is the thing which you can look forward to because the rest pretty much sucks.the remaining question is why aren't they able to produce a good and decent movie based on a DC comic?",Suicide Squad

I've watched all the DC animated films and shows over the past 2 decades. I liked most of the animated DC films and comics more than the animated Marvel over the years, but DC Movies are no where near the quality of the Marvel ones of recent. This might be my least favorite Comic Book Movie ever. And I saw all of the Fantastic Four films and X-Men films. I liked Man of Steel and even Batman vs Superman but this one being part of same shared universe.... Not high hopes for the rest of the films. The story was very weak and poorly done with such high potential it fell so so short.",Suicide Squad
1652,sharranjamison,Much More Than I Expected,10,8 August 2016,"I thoroughly enjoyed the action, the cinematography, the characters and the story line. I am typically not a DC fan (Marvel 100%). However, I loved it and fell in love with the characters. I only expected to love Harley Quinn, but they are all equally amazingly portrayed. Each portrayal of each character was so spot on, that I can't see anyone being replaced. These actors are now forever linked with their characters and I am looking forward to them carrying these characters on in future DC movies. This movie was very well done. I'm most definitely going to see it again. I had the pleasure of seeing it at IMAX in 3D and yes, it was worth the $40 paid for two tickets.

1654,febin-john,DC is going the wrong way.....,4,4 December 2016,"After Superman vs Batman, I had a lot of expectations from DC studios as the former was unbearable. When David Ayer was attached to the project, I had high expectations as I loved FURY. When the first trailer dropped it made me impatient, however to my surprise the movie did not live up to the hype or the expectation many had. There is something really wrong with how DC studios is making movies. It had no convincing story, bad direction etc etc...The only likable character in the movie was Harley Quinn. Dc really needs to have good writers who understand comic adaptations as they really lack it at the moment. From what i see , JUSTICE LEAGUE is in great danger...",Suicide Squad
1655,carlhenrik-kristoffersen,"A suicide, indeed",4,26 April 2018,"The movie started off great with really cool introductions, but from there it all goes down the drain. This movie had the potential to be the dark, crude and gritty super-anti-hero movie that would be a refreshing twist to the comicbook adaptions. Sadly, it's a shallow non-dimensional mess that fails to be funny, and concludes in a mythological stand-off which feels severely displaced in this universe, and rather something that belongs in The Mummy. DCU really killed their potential with Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad
1656,madskr1,Not satisfied,5,7 December 2016,"I have to agree with the visible review before me. This movie was a disappointment, the script feels unpolished and the plot incomplete, the characters not deeply enough developed. The movie has great actors but it's not enough to save the movie from all it's pitholes, sadly I got fedd up and bored by about 55-60% of the movie and left watching it there.The joker imitation with green hair was just a overall boring character with nothing special to add, just felt off to me, this character should not have been in the movie or should have been completely rehauled.I do not recommend this movie.",Suicide Squad
1657,patrick-317,This Movie actually gets most things right,7,18 August 2016,"Believe it or not people... this isn't a Joker or Batman movie. This isn't a thought provoking introspective movie either. It's meant to be a fun movie and possibly be one that introduces new characters to most.Without spoiling things- What the movie gets right: 1. Great introduction to characters with some real good casting choices there. 2. This is supposed to be a frenetic movie with action coming from all angles 3. Actually quite funny 4. Jared Leto's joker is actually really good- an interesting new takeThis part here touches on spoilers- What they got wrong: 1. Having a supernatural enemy here was probably not a great choice. Would have been better to go with a terrorist, or the Joker or... just not this enemy 2. With the point above- too much CGI on the enemy and all the enemy minions. 3. Would have been more fun if they pushed the envelope a bit more on content. Should have made it an R rated action movie. These aren't good guys you knowBut I left the movie satisfied with the fun I was expecting. Harley Quinn and Deadshot are certainly now qualified to be in more DC universe movies.Here's hoping for a Suicide Squad 2.",Suicide Squad
1658,david-a-lubetsky,Suicidé squad was just not good..,3,7 August 2016,"I am massively disappointed by Suicide Squad. I hate to say it, but the critics mostly hit the nail on the head. Margot Robbie was awesome as Harley Quinn. Will Smith was decent as Dead Shot. I think Jared Leto was not impressive as the Joker. I could barely follow what was going on at points.. the villain was stupid. Maybe instead of dancing around she could have helped save her brother lolI'm a huge fan of the DC TV universe, love Arrow, Flash, Legends, Gotham. I think they need to focus on that audience and use the same actors for the movies. It's time. Stop the madness and wasted money.My friend and I were discussing how good DC is at making trailers. Suicide Squad looked good in the previews. They should just release short films.",Suicide Squad
1659,julesxoxo999,Quick and to the point (not their fault you missed the point),7,27 April 2019,"A much needed break from the typical 'superheroes united' films with characters being previously introduced in other standalone films.
Being able to fit a background story for each anti-hero and explain their involvement in the suicide squad was crucial to the overall team chemistry, and was very well delivered. Unfortunately the 2 hour run-time limited the action parts significantly (but given DC's inability to create quality CGI, perhaps it was for the better)
In the end, lack of plot twists, unresolved mysteries, and information overflow allowed everything else to work together seamlessly.",Suicide Squad
1660,xapanthe,Unfortunate disappointment.,5,21 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was one of the most anticipated titles of 2016 and as most of people, I had high expectations. I knew that Jared Leto wouldn't disappoint as Joker, nevertheless, I was disappointed. Not because of Leto, but for the editing / cutting. Joker was a mild character that didn't really have any impact on me. Hopefully an R- rated movie of Joker (& Harley) will come out.. and I hope he has a big role on the upcoming Justice League and untitled Batman movie.Suicide Squad was mostly dialogue and some arguing between Deadshot (Will Smith) and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman). Action and fighting was uninteresting. Character development and initializing was nothing to remember. There were virtually no heavy/emotional scenes that would hit you. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was good, but again, it should have been something more.I am pretty sure David Ayer and the producing team could have done better. I am also fairly confident that the studio backed out and wanted to tone down the violence, gore and dark tone of the movie. I so wanted to love this movie, but now with the thin plot combined with buddy-team-western style of setup and PG-13 rating, this movie failed in the eyes of the fans. I am fairly confident that the BvS success (or failure) defined what they wanted out of this movie. BvS was too dark and hard to chew for most of the people, at least if you have no background knowledge of the DC universe. This is why they made Suicide Squad easier to the public, thus failing this film, damn. Of course there were some enjoyable moments and at least a directors cut version could fill out some of the holes. Overall I am happy that DC is trying to expand the universe more and more and bring out some lesser known characters alive. Suggestion: studio and marketing people, stay away from the artistic process and trust your people. This is why Deadpool succeeded. You don't have to compete with Marvel & Avengers. Let them have the light-hearted buddy-western style, it suits them perfectly. Can't imagine Ayer being at the premiere going ""aw yiss, this is exactly what I wanted out of this movie!""",Suicide Squad
1661,jouavelc,super villains become super heroes and grow hearts,3,7 August 2016,"So I watched Suicide Squad okay it was bloody terrible. Cara (love her but) like needs to stop they should of let her character die cause she was trash and so we don't have to put up with that awfulness again, if they do make a sequel, which I hope they do. Like I mean you had to introduce the characters with their backgrounds I mean it took like forever but it had to be done. I would of liked to see Katana's background because she is so freaking cool! So it kind of sets us up for a sequel, but oh my god the ""villain"" enchantress and her weird Cersie/ Jamie relationship with her brother going on was absolutely terrible like there are so many more better villains they could of used! All in all it needed a better story line and the music needed to stop changing every time the camera moved to a bloody different angle but I think they need a round two to improve themselves and I think they'll do much better. Props to the rest of the cast who I thought were great in. Their characters worked well, Will and Margot mesh well. Jared Leto was the bloody highlight as the joker he saved the movie as much as he could with the stupid 5 seconds of cameo he had they need to make Suicide Squad because of him!",Suicide Squad

It's one of the worst comic book adaptions of recent memory, and it could and should have been better. However, I came with zero exceptions and the bottom line is I mostly enjoyed it. I'll note some of it's flaws: -The villains are unique-less, weird magic-zombies led by an annoying and overly-sexualized character with a boring and pointless side story about an affair with the squad's leader. -I didn't like the new Joker, who had a completely useless and pretty small part here. -Harley Quinn is an annoying slut.

I would like to have had a little background on other character like Katana, Enchantress and the Australian dude that seamed pointless! The reason they go ahead with the mission is very weak! There are also parts of the scrip that will make you cringe, constantly pointing out things that the audience can clearly see for themselves. Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) played the role well and looks the part, she did have a very dodgy downtown Brooklyn accent though that came and went as the film progressed. Will Smith was good, as usual and Deadshot is a character that could possibly make a good movie. The joker was a joke but is this because we got spoiled with the late great Heath Ledger or the remarkable Jack Nicholson? Jared Leto didn't do the part justice.",Suicide Squad

This movie fails on so many levels but succeeds in two major aspect: marketing and earnings.There are too many character, poor editing and there is no red thread to follow. Plot points are dropped and others picked up. Characters remain mysteries by sheer neglect, making it difficult to connect to them. This is Hollywood blockbuster at a low point. They rushed through the making, and spent all their focus on marketing. Because if you want to make money, marketing is were to focus.

1666,moviezyx,Suicide Squad suffers from Zacification,4,5 August 2016,"Margot Robbie! TADA!! That should have said it all. That should have been the one thing that mattered. After the masterpiece trailers showed just how great she was as Harley Quinn, I knew I was going to see this movie. No one else, nothing else mattered. Harley is a sexy, twisted, bad girl that I know I would never get close to in real life. Thank God for fantasy out of reach in this real world. Thank Margot for her portrayal. I hope she gets a chance to take Harley on again.You can thank someone else for the fact that even Robbie could not save this perfect example of a typically poorly directed super-hero style movie. While Harley had me glaring at every move she made for the first half, she lost her allure in the second half as she became less appealing. The whole movie seemed to have lost its character in the second half. Joker was not needed. 11 minutes of gratuitous joker seemed a waste of time and I feel his presence dulled the movie. Yeah, Leto put a lot into the character but, for what? I imagine his absurdity is what softened the impact of the other characters. All of the characters were interesting but not so desirable as Harley Quinn. And while I am at it, Amanda Waller was bad-ass enough, but she had to destroy her employees? WTH? Totally uncalled for. Sure it's only a movie, but that move made no sense.My suggestion is to accept the fact that any movie that has Zac Snyder's name connected to it is going to suck as in Sucker Punch and everything else he touches. If you want to see Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, even for only the first half of the movie, then you should go.When DC and Warner realize how shallow Snyder's movies are then they might be able to get on track for quality movies. I just have to wonder if Snyder is so lacking in personality himself that he does not understand how lacking his characters are in his movies? (Yes I know he was an executive producer). Maybe DC and Warner should give total control to Chris Nolan.",Suicide Squad

1668,zubingarda,A bus ride from office to home in the evening,6,6 August 2016,"The most important lesson I know about movies is this: If James Bond is the hero of your film, you'd better have a world-dominater as the villain – not a Store Accountant fudging the books.This, in whole, sums up the problem with Suicide Squad. It was as if WB decided that having a powerful and charismatic villain would detract from the Suicide Squad coolness. So they deliberately put in a villain who would be super-powerful, but fall short – way short – of the ""charm"" of the members of the Squad themselves. Because, God forbid, the villain should outshine the squad. Then how would WB make this into a franchise? So let's begin with the review: First off, there is one point which many critics so far, got wrong. That the music is so loud that it detracts. That does not happen. Never at any point in the movie.However, unfortunately everything else they say, is more or less, correct.So we start off the movie with a bunch of flashbacks, which I think were okay. Though, when it came to Deadshot/Will Smith's flashbacks, I wondered whether I was watching a feature film, or a soap-opera on television. Will Smith in tears. His daughter in tears. The background music in tears. The weather in tears. I was sure Batman was going to be in tears too! Thank God, he just smirks and kicks Will's posterior, instead.Then we are introduced to Amanda Waller juxtaposed with the flashbacks of the squad members. She's supposed to be some kind of ""I'm such a bad female-canine and I have a three mile detonation radius"" woman, but instead, if you can visualize a world-weary Principal of a kid's school, you've already seen her in your mind then. You know the type. Strict. Matronly. Clipped English. Talking only as needed. Economical with movements. Prim. Proper. Then, you've seen Amanda Waller.We also get scenes of the bad boys and girl (Harley, in this case) being tortured in the prison, with sad, melancholy background music being played in the background. We're supposed to 'feel' for this bunch, dammit. But all that goes on in our minds is Deadshot has orphaned so many children, widowed even more men and women. Harley has killed so many, broken so many homes and lives. So it's hard to feel sympathy for the characters. A minus point – Harley tries to out-joker the Joker. Every time. All the time. Even in normal conversations. Yikes! I guess being unhinged means making faces (the kind you make to get your baby brother in the pram to laugh) and saying trite one-liners. Well, WB, whatever floats your boat.Then one of them, the Witch (don't miss her incredibly toned abs, I must say), escapes and becomes the villain. Then turns men into gloppy zombies that do her bidding. Which is to wipe out humanity. Oh, the humanity! The zombies well, imagine a high school kid with face covered full of zits. Lots and lots of them. And large ones, mind it. Purple too. Well, those are the zombies.After that, the movie basically is about ""bondage"". Not that kind, but the ""we're gonna bond so good the audience will cheer us with tears in their eyes"" stuff. Some action scenes the follow. Military men Team A shooting zombies. Military men Team B shooting zombies. Will Smith climbing on cars and shooting zombies. Boomerang boomeranging zombies. Harley baseball batting zombies. Croc biting zombies (ugh!), Katana samurai-zing zombies, and thenmore of thatwhenwait, more of that againafter which, we finally come toum mm..more of that, even now!...Then, abruptly, the final confrontation. I don't want to spoil it for you. But it was like you were traveling home in a bus and the conductor announcing your stop had arrived. You felthmm, time to get off. You checked your surroundings for missing items or something you may have left behind, smiled at the people who usually travel at the same time as you do, then step of the bus, happy to be home. That's what it feels like. A bus ride. And before you know it, it's over. Just like that. Over. No, really! Finally, let me comment quickly on a few things:JOKER: Jared's trying too hard. His image and makeup were spot on, though. If he were ""reserved"" with it, like Heath Ledger was, then Jared would have raised the movie through the roof. He would have been the ""new Joker"". Instead, he blows it – he gesticulates, goes through maniacal facial expressions (which Heath never did, hence the CHILLING Joker, one which caused fear). Let us just say, that Jared's threat levels are because of what he can do. Heath's threat levels were because of who he was. A difference, lost on WB and Leto, both.BATMAN: Ben Affleck. Kicks Will's ass. Kicks Joker and HQ's ass. Kicks Joker's car's ass with the bat-mobile. Saves HQ. Punches HQ in the face, unapologetic. Will cries, daughter cries, Batman smirks. Then kick's Will's ass even more. Rocks!! KATANA: Why was she in this? BOOMERANG: Supposed to be the comic relief. WB have serious introspection to do. Fire your Casting Supervisor and Casting Director asap CROC: Quite nice, actually. Except, he shouldn't be wearing a double hoodie! Looks ridiculous in that. Bare chested, torn vest, muscular, killer ragenow THAT'S the Croc we all know and love.FIREMAN/DIABLO: Tattooed. Any other gangster. No personality. Shoots fire from finger tips. Yawn! SLIPKNOT: Blink. And you miss him.DEATHSTROKE!! : Just kidding. He's not there.EVERYONE ELSE: Everything generic about the military. It's there.So, final word about the movie? A couple of times I asked myself: Is it over yet? Not a good start, WB. Definitely not a good start.",Suicide Squad
1669,therynocity,A great addition into a still growing cinematic universe,8,5 August 2016,"Saw this film last night in IMAX 3D with my mom. We both enjoyed very much, the fact that before the movie started my mom asked ""so is this marvel or something?"" and by the end of the movie became familiar with the characters is quite a feat honestly. Pros:Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Joel Kinnaman and Will Smith absolutely own their roles as Harley Quinn, Amanda Waller, Rick Flagg and Deadshot respectively.The action scenes, while not as many as I might have hoped for, were placed throughout the film in a way that the pacing remained unaffected. Was great to see some of DC's finest villains fight together for the first time on screen.The chemistry among the cast definitely shows and the humor is very effective. The audience at my showing was laughing at nearly every well-placed joke.Cameos from other justice league members are short but effective, they don't overshadow the movie in any shape or form. Cons:Jared Leto as the Joker was barely on screen in order to get an opinion of him. What I did see was promising, but it is a completely different take on the joker that everyone may not be on board with.Enchantress, El Diablo, and Killer Croc have OK story arcs throughout this movie, but nothing that wows, unlike their aforementioned other team members. Katana speaks Japanese and has cool sword fight scenes, but also doesn't have much to do on screen.Do I really need to mention slipknot as a character? Not even a spoiler it's just like common knowledge at this point.Overall, My mom and I enjoyed the film for what it was, a comic book popcorn action film, is it as good as say civil war or Deadpool? No. But it knows what it is and you'll have a kick-ass time at the theater watching it.Oh. And be sure to stay for the mid-credit scene, sets up the rest of the DCEU in a neat way.",Suicide Squad

So it's only natural for many to think that this movie was not good enough. (Although being a Marvel fan. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie)The movie had a very nice blend of comedy with gruesome seriousness. It gave a good competition to the other CBM's that have released this past year, but just fail to top the charts. Since the trailers had dropped, the good thing that David Ayer kept in mind was not to reveal any plot line to the public, as many people had lost their minds after what BvS had done.There are tons of lighthearted moments delivered by all the characters. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jai Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Cara Delevingne and Joel Kinnaman all had done a brilliant job in their respective roles. The man to fill in big shoes was Jared Leto. And personally I found him to be a better Joker than his predecessor, Heath Ledger.All in all, this movie could've definitely been much much better given the characters and the universe it is involved in. They could've made more use of the characters, made the run time of the movie a little longer, and given a more elaborate build up to the villain.",Suicide Squad

It could be great, it could be one of the best and most enjoyable comic book super-hero action movie instead of being a critically controversial movie.First of all I will tell about the positives of the movie.The thing I love most about Suicide Squad is the characters and performance. Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Joker, Amanda Waller, Boomerang and nearly every characters was amazing. And the actors who portrayed those character done their job perfectly. My personal favorite was deadshot <3 Will Smith <3 and Harley <3 Margot Robbie <3. Joker was awesome too but he was misused (more on that later) Another thing I love about Suicide Squad is it's tone. It was super funny, light hearted and filed with character moment that you can attach with. I love the back story of Harley and jokerbackstory of Deadshot  Loved the batman cameos and other cameos :P  Loved the actions and the soundtracks -- Now let's talk about the negatives. Although the story is decent (not so great).. the editing was horrible it look like they cut a lot of things from the movie hence the movie feels disjointed and in disconnectedspecially the introduction and story of joker <3 Jared Leto <3 tries to do something different with the joker, without repeating Heath Ledger's joker and He did a really good job but editing make his introduction sloppy and his story misplaced(But looking forward to see what Jared Leto aka joker do next in batman movie). And my second negative issue with Suicide Squad is the villain. DC has great villains but don't know why, they seems to fail capturing great villains in DCCU. The trailer made us believe that villain is the joker. And than it's looks like Enchantress is the villain. But it's again looks like Amanda Waller is the real villain. They don't even know what they are doing.. --but apart form those issues, in the end I really enjoyed Suicide Squad.. I really loved those characters and can't wait to see what next. It made my hyped for upcoming DCCU movies.",Suicide Squad
1673,dragochan12,It's nothing special but not as bad as the critics say.,7,9 August 2016,"I, like many others had been anticipating this movie for a very long time. The trailers looked great, but unfortunately, it was deceiving. This movie didn't deliver my expectations but delivered something. The Pros: Humour: Unlike the previous DC movies (yes, including TDK trilogy) this movie offers a much lighter tone and humour, most of it worked, some didn't. But the fact the movie is lighter will make it more entertaining and fun for some. Harley: Harley Quinn was simply amazing, Margot Robbie did a fantastic job of portraying the character. She is sexy, insane, yet gave the innocent vibe Harley has. She is one of the reasons I liked the movie.Deadshot: I personally didn't expect much from Deadshot, but then again, it's Will Smith, a huge name. His character is charismatic, bad ass and delivers humour when it's needed. He was definitely the most humane out of the squad.El Diablo: El Diablo stole the show, his character arc was emotional and worked on well. What he does, (for those who watched Suicide Squad) is redeemable. The Joker: From the limited screen time Jared's Joker provided, he was still amazing. Though it is unfair to compare him to Ledger. Jared's take is different and has a mobster vibe to it. However, he is still creepy, twisted, insane and your left wanting more.The Cons: The villain: I don't want to spoil on who the villain is, but I'd say the villain is very disappointing. The villain is bland, boring, undeveloped, and to me, cringe worthy. DC is known to have very good villains, however, this time, it was horrendous. The story line: The story line is very generic, stop the bad guy from destroying the city. It's point A to point B. The story line isn't worked on and it is very rushed. The first arc is well is good, however, the second and third arc are sloppy and rushed. It wasn't enjoyable and seemed like a big mess. Overall I don't hate it, but I don't love it. It's not something special but it's not what the critics say it is though I wouldn't raise expectations. I'd give it a 6/10 or 7/10",Suicide Squad
1674,phillyfilmbuff,Suicide Squad arrives posthumously ...,4,20 August 2016,Apart from Jared Leto's turn as The Joker and a few fun moments with Robbie and Leto this comic book entry is flat and somewhat dull despite the action.The premise: In the wake of Superman's death an Intel Operative proposes to utilize the skills of some criminals with powers of their own (ala The Dirty Dozen) against an enchantress and her minions. The introduction of each of the super criminals gives hope that this is going to be a fun ride but it never pans out. Much humor is needed but the little we get is pathetic! This is an example of a project poorly thought out and even more poorly executed.,Suicide Squad
1675,jasonAze,"Great movie, must watch.",9,18 August 2016,"I've now watched this movie twice and can say that i really enjoyed the movie. I read a good amount of the dc series but never really dabbled in to suicide squad, so i went in to the movie not know much other then the squad them self and Amanda Waller. i was very satisfied with Jared Leto's joker, i do think heath ledger has title for best joker as of now, but Jared Leto is the closest to the comic book joker we've had so far. The comedy in the movie was well spread out, action frequent and thrilling, and overall well balanced. my only gripe is very small, and that would be killer croc, he did almost nothing special in the movie, gave no laughs, and was scrawny for what he is supposed to be, but i can live with that.",Suicide Squad
1676,AliNasirR,Great characters played very nicely by good actors in an average movie with a tiny and stretched plot.,7,16 August 2016,"This is the third time in a row (their third movie in this sequence too) that DCEU has messed up the plot flow.+ Lovely VFX. One of the most important things for a comic based superhero action movie. + Acting. The trailer got most of us to fall in love with Harley Quinn already. Everyone else did a pretty decent job too. + Soundtracks. Nicely adjusted popular rock songs like Iron Man, Seven Nation Army, Bohemian Rhapsody etc. + Humour. Saving their ass by making people laugh.Bad plot flow. It's gripping in the start. Keeping you entertained and stuff. But it becomes such a drag later. The second half is like one long dragged episode of Arrow. I really really really hope Justice League isn't another consecutive drag. Lots of new important characters with no introductory movies. This is the biggest and the most annoying problem with DCEU. They're rushing too fast, giving introduction very little importance. It is important for the audience to build a bond with the characters before a crossover movie. And not just the characters, but the actors playing them too. They did the same with BvS. Very few situations and locations. They stay in one situation and location for painfully long times. They did the same in BvS and pretty much in Man of Steel too. It's an action movie, not a drama movie. The story needs to progress on a fast pace. Dark colour tone almost throughout the movie. I'm not sure if that was an Atrium Cinemas problem or a cinematography problem. But anyway, it was physically stressful to watch at times. Same thing was with BvS.Also, all those complaining about Joker's part being too little and too serious need to realise that.. 1. Joker sure is a legendary character but he was not a main character in this particular film. He's obviously going to have more films to prove his importance. 2. His seriousness, which was very nicely inspired by the story, doesn't represent his character entirely. It wasn't an acting fault. It was merely a cameo. Jared Leto is bloody remarkably brilliant. I'd give the movie a fair 7.3/10",Suicide Squad
1677,staub_alex,Cinematic suicide,2,9 August 2016,"I was hoping that Warcraft would be the last movie I see which made me want to choke on my own popcorn rather than sit through the rest of the film within 20 minutes. However, the team around Suicide Squad displayed a level of shameless disregard of people's viewing pleasure I haven't witnessed since Gawker decided to publish Hulk Hogan's sex tape. Not that I watched it but I can't imagine the dialog, acting and story line being worse. First of all, I have seldom seen such blatant casting mistakes before, besides every movie with Jack Black after School of Rock. Will Smith was so obviously playing Will Smith, I doubt he was aware he was even being filmed. And he undoubtedly gave the best performance. Cara Delevingne is forgiven for her ridiculous attempts at evoking some kind of feeling other than vicarious shame from the viewer, although just narrowly. What are you supposed to expect of somebody who is famous for wearing H&M rags and having aggressively unkempt eyebrows. The joker was a whiny, overdrawn caricature of the brilliant performance by Heath Ledger, who must be spinning in his grave right now. They might as well have simply used Mark Hamill, gave him the exact same script of Star Wars and made him wear the same robe, it would have been less painful to watch than Jared Leto's continued attempts at ""acting"". At least people would be pleasantly reminded of Mark's former voice acting days as the joker. Even the 10 seconds of Batman and the Flash was like a terrible foreshadowing of the inevitable Justice League disaster to come. But worst of all, by a mile and a million, was Margot Robbie's performance. I have seen more believable acting from my cat after it threw up on the kitchen floor and tried to casually walk off as though nothing happened. Her terrible dialect and completely over the top impression of a mentally deranged teenager made me cringe at every second. I'm not going to mention the croc, the sergeant and the woman with the single, constipated facial expression because I'm afraid my nose might start bleeding from high blood pressure. Not to mention Captain Boomerang, what the effing eff was that about!The acting alone would have been enough to make me want to question the sanity of the production team. The script was the cherry on top of the chocolate cyanide sundae. The conversations consisted of the main actors vomiting one liners at each other which would have made Arnold Schwarzenegger's ears bleed. You can physically feel the panic of the director who is pressured to make sense out of this terrible mistake by half heatedly cramming in background stories. By the time it's ""el diablo""'s turn, he obviously has completely given up. Out of absolutely nowhere the guy who hasn't spoken an intelligible word for the whole movie feels the need to spill his guts about why he's not the bad ass gangbanger he used to be anymore. He might as well have yelled it at a dish washer. I swear I could hear Will Smith mentally face palming in the background. The Joker's role in the whole movie is another, completely random event and part of the greatest deception in movie trailer history. Up until the last second, there is no reason for him to even be in the whole movie, leaving aside his abysmal performance. It feels like they noticed early enough that Margot's performance as Harlequin was ruining the whole movie so they had to invent a ridiculously exaggerated backstory, which only ended up ruining the reputation of one of the best movie villains ever. Ultimately, the whole movie is just a giant mistake of a prequel for worse to come. Btw., if anybody does go to see it, make sure to resist the urge to run out of the cinema and drink until you forgot what you just endured. You might miss Ben Afflek, aka Bruce Wayne, aka Beefcake Batman's final scene. Sorry for the ""spoiler"". I gave an extra star for Harlequin's hotpants. At least the costume designers knew what they were doing.",Suicide Squad
1678,Jayhawk777,A truly disappointing waste of film.,2,1 August 2016,"Maybe Suicide Squad is not as bad as Man of Steel or Batman V Superman but still quite bad. As expected, it's poorly written on every level. Every single character feels shallow and one dimensional and again justlike the first two tries from the DCU it's as we all feared. Word of mouth will very much hurt this effort because the trailer tried to fool viewers in to thinking this movie is something it's not. It's mangled and, frankly, has no heart at all. I know blindly loyal fanboys everywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in and of itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it and apparently will look past all of its flaws no matter what actually hits the screen. We saw it with BvS and we are seeing it here.Just like with BvS, everyone is saying or will soon be saying that Suicide Squad is a dumb popcorn flick at best but really nothing special. How can a film follow something that's bad two times over but still give anyone high expectations? Yet, thanks to good trailers, that's exactly what happened.The actual movie AGAIN leads to general disappointment especially if you're not already a fan. Campy, cheesy fluff pretending to be dark and serious usually fizzles out fast. Yet, as MOS and BvS proved this may be another indestructible franchise that won't die no matter how bad the stuff they churn out. A truly disappointing waste of film.",Suicide Squad
1679,fyusang,The other color of Zack Snyder producing,5,5 August 2016,"Producer. Not only who is responsible of the funding the movie production, but also to give advice or the goals (read. requirement) of the movie. Usually even if the director have demands for making decision of the movie, it's all up to the producer to approve or to decline. As the producer, Zack Snyder does ""live"" very clearly in David Ayer's movie. The color is one of the elements that this movie offers. From the early movie trailer it was all over the scene. The posters. If usually Snyder uses gold to sepia color, David Ayers give cyan to magenta. It was as if Ayer made a cartooned form from the earlier Zack Snyder movies. Sill it was dark.

But, some of the characters (Harley, Capt boomerang, dead-shot, killer croc) were either fun or bad ass enough to still make it an enjoyable movie going experience!

1681,noahspidey,city goes boom.,3,8 August 2016,"SUICIDE SQUAD RANT. SPOILERS!!! I am a huge fan of DC comics. I grew up reading the comic books, and batman is my all time favorite superhero so I have a special fondness for these characters. Its a shame they were wasted in this ""movie"". None of the characters had any development or arc besides deadshot, who's entire character was a tired trope we have seen a million times before (bad man has daughter so he tries to be good for her) and el diablo who's ""we're a family"" speech at the end feels so rushed and unearned it was more humorous than heartfelt. The rest were just explained to us cliffs notes style by the narrarat- I mean Amanda Waller (i.e. ""this person is like a crocodile who eats people, this person was an archaeologist who's became possessed, etc""). Harley Quinn was perhaps the biggest waste. Her character is a useless member of the squad who has no special powers or traits besides being the jokers girlfriend (which makes her more of a liability than anything else). The appeal of her character is witnessing how the joker can influence a seemingly normal psychologist into becoming a psychopath, and then seeing how she realizes how poorly he has been treating her and her rebellion against him. This film completely skips over the first transformation (the first flashback is her agreeing to get the joker a gun in prison) and never reaches the second, providing us with a character that 1. contributes nothing to the group and 2. never develops. It is so painfully obvious how DC wants spinoffs and sequels to explore things that should never have been left out of this movie. The actual ""SQUAD"" never actually interact until about halfway through the film so when they do, the chemistry is half baked and unearned. The joker is not a memorable presence, and seems less like the criminal mastermind that he should be and more like a slightly quirky gangster. (Also if batman is murdering people now, why is the joker still alive? and how has he not been caught yet when he spends his time in nightclubs and parading himself around the city? C'mon Batman!). The villain is underdeveloped and generic (blue beam shooting into the sky, faceless minions for the heroes to kill, weak motivations). Also, if her plan was to release her brother and take over the world, why would she not do it while she was at the temple immediately after possessing dr. Moon? Other quick thoughts: 1. can we have an Asian action hero who isn't a samurai or ninja for once? 2. the first 2 action scenes in the city are nearly identical (creatures attack, flagg is grabbed by the creatures, squad shoots them, el diablo sulks in the corner. 3. why put a deep pool in killer crocs cell that he can hide in and attack you from? 4. where were the flash, batman, or wonder woman when an entire city was being destroyed? we know they are active during this time period and even make some brief cameos but never show up to help during the world ending catastrophe.",Suicide Squad
1682,glamour199,I am upset,1,12 August 2016,"First of all, sorry to those who are fans of this movieNow that being said,I know that you people have mastered the graphics and no one can compete you guys so yaay. About the movie, what was the writer/director thinking when making this movie? Other than just showing some scary faces, what else is vivid in this movie? In the past, the bf and gf don't care about anything and instead of turning into a monster she helps the same army who just killed her bf. The scary monster who would kill everyone in its way just listens like a 3rd grade student when instructions are given? so why would he even care for his own life. And the villain girl who can bring nuclear plans of a country in a split second and who can get into people's minds doesn't know how to stop someone who has been fighting against her? This movie is the dumbest I have ever seen or watched. If you people had to make a movie, just put it in two parts rather than trying to squeeze everything in a two hour movie Next time when you think of making money, go and buy some company shares and that will make you money or lose as you will in this movie In short, I would not recommend this movie to those who might have high hope, instead, go and watch some cartoon with your children and probably you will have some joy rather than spending money on it",Suicide Squad

Joker is not even comparable to Heath Leadger's. This movie could have been the next Watchmen, instead of next rubbish. Cast was OK, except Will Smith who seems to portray same character in every movie he made for the last 5-10 years. His eyes thing in every scene became old soon.

Will Smith wasn't as bad as I thought he would be. Batfleck is turning out to be the best Batman ever. I didn't expect to see a lot of Batman going in since I had already seen the animated version. The movie had some good moments though. Not enough to give it any more than a 6. Not really happy with Zach Snyders work overall doing DC movies. I could say the same thing about my movie reviews.

I was expecting this movie to have the dark humor like Deadpool, and an even darker tone throughout the entire plot. I was upset that the anti-heroes in this movie were so easily liked. Like, no! These are villains that kill innocent people for fun to take over the world! The main characters' evilness were downplayed. However, the characters were colorful and fun, and I did enjoy their dialogue between each other. Robbie and Smith hit it out of the park with their acting while the other actors seemed to not even matter. I felt like the joker was only in this movie to tease the audience with more upcoming movies about him. He only had probably 8 minutes of screen time. My biggest dislike of this movie was the main villain all the characters had to defeat. Like a witch?? Really? A witch that made a non human army that had bad CGI and was so hard to take seriously. This villain seemed like it shouldn't even belong in the DC universe and it was hard to understand the villain's reasoning to take over the world. This movie was fun and the characters were so enjoyable to watch. It was fun to like the villains and even start to love their craziness.

1690,bbland19,It was...... OK,6,7 June 2017,"While this is by far not my favorite comic book movie, it is (so far) my favorite of the DCEU. The production value and most of the acting was the best I've seen thus far, but DC still has a long way to go before they can even start to compete with Marvel. The big problem with the movie is that the focus was on Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), which didn't give the rest of the characters a fair enough chance to shine. In one of the last scenes most of the Suicide Squad comes back to finish the fight with Enchantress, but none of them were given a real reason to. They were never introduced properly and there was no screen time where all the characters bonded enough to fight for one another. In reality, it felt like they just said, ""fuck it, might as well fight."" The one thing Suicide Squad did well is show the relationship between Harley Quinn (Robbie) and The Joker (Jared Leto). I know a lot of people had a problem with Leto's interpretation of Joker, but the scenes that had Harley and Joker together were by far the best in the movie. They had just the right balance between telling you how they got there, and mystery of why it happened in the first place. Overall, I think this was a good effort by DC and Warner Bros., and I think it's a good sign of what's to come.",Suicide Squad

There are few things that still bothers me, but the more time passes and I go through the movie in my head, the more I start to like it. Sure there was too many ""jokes"" for my liking and in someway the soundtrack (as good as the songs are) annoyed me, but in the end those are minor things. Where was the mess and whatnot that some critics/reviewers are writing about? Simple plot and lot's of action with some great performances by the actors equals a good and solid comic book movie in my book. OK, if you are waiting for some deep and complex plot with unseen twists and turns, then you may/will be disappointed.Overall I don't get what the h*ll were the critics waiting for? A new American Beauty? Suicide Squad was entertaining and I'm already waiting for the Blu-ray to come out.

With that said, don't waste your time watching the theatrical version. If your going to watch this movie for the first time, or even if you've seen it many times before, the extended cut is MUCH BETTER.
I don't understand why all the Joker scenes were cut. His character is slightly more developed in the extended cut. Also, it explains a little bit more about the relationship between Harley & Joker.
Pieces I thought were pretty important, I found were all left out in the theatrical version.
I thought this movie had a lot of potential that it didn't quite reach. The acting wasn't the problem in my opinion. It started out great, but lost its way pretty quickly after the character introductions.
And I absolutely had a hard time with the CGI army of alien bad guys.

1695,lukasaurelius,Incoherent and patchwork storyline,6,22 June 2021,"I originally watched this film when it was first released, and I thought it was alright, but nothing quite like the hype made it. But I chalked it up to not knowing the comic book source for these characters as much as maybe the Marvel cast in similar superhero films.I've just finished reading a whole Suicide Squad comic collection, and it was great! The team dynamics were quite fun 🙂 So then I thought I'd re-watch the Suicide Squad film now that I'm more acquainted with all the characters and backstory.Admittedly, the film makes a little more sense to me now, having read some of the comics, but it was still pretty underwhelming. There's so much potential from the comics and yet the film felt a little patchworked and all over the place. I think there was too much going on and not enough coherence. I mean, at one point I'd even forgot that Enchantress and her brother were destroying the city (and it almost seemed like the film writers did too!) as the focus was on the characters getting dressed and fighting in the streets, rescuing Waller and then it felt like ""oh yeah, there's still that other storyline to wrap up"".DC needs to get some better script writers or something, because it's definitely not an issue with source material! I'm hoping it'll get better with the coming DC films and any sequels to SS.",Suicide Squad
1696,sperling1349,Bad movie with two bright spots,2,5 August 2016,"Was it a romance? A rescue mission? Save the world? Who was the main character? This movie was bad from the beginning. The only bright spots were Deadshot and Diablo. The only two characters with any depth. The Rick Flag character was totally unbelievable as a Colonel, he just came across as a complete poser. They scraped the bottom of the barrel with this guy. Jared Leto as the Joker was pathetic, he was trying to be Heath Ledger's Joker and utterly failed. The story was bad, the characters were even worse, there were at least 4 different story lines that sort of ended up working together, but the two romances in the movie were bad. No chemistry, nothing holding anything together. It was a complete waste of 2 hours of my time. I should have gone with my daughter to see Secret Life of Pets. Don't waste your time. And DC? Please stop making movies.",Suicide Squad
1697,mattyinks,Laughably stupid,1,23 August 2016,Will Smith and the blonde chick try to save this disaster-piece the whole awful ride through. It sucked. It was awful. By the end the villain looked like it was out of the Mummy 9 and the only thing worse than that mess was whatever the f!@# happened to the joker. What an embarrassing film to be a part of. Shame on DC for mocking its fans with this trash. Im only typing more now to fill up the lines on this review. I really don't want to say anything else about this stupid movie because it really isn't worth the thought. Save your money. Wait for something marvel. At least they don't bend their fans over a barrel. I mean come on dead-pool was the s*&^.,Suicide Squad
1698,GObonzo,decent quality movie. disappointing in many aspects as most DC & Marvel films are,7,20 August 2016,"the characters are portrayed rather well. except for The Joker that is. this is the worst interpretation of The Joker I have ever seen. and I really didn't think it could get any worse than Heath Ledger, but it has.one big thing I can never understand about the comics or the movies: how/why do all the other huge amount of meta-humans and superheroes in this universe just let things like this go on without even trying to intervene? where is Flash, Wonder Woman, Shazaam, Super-Girl and all the other multitudes? the world is coming to an end, monsters are threatening human existence and only a few cheap villains appear because some government agency prompts them to?",Suicide Squad
1699,hmz2798,Two words. Atrocious and Horrible,1,3 January 2017,"Complete garbage, they ruined The Joker and Harley by cramming everything in like adding in extra useless characters such as batman and others, they didn't fit it in and didn't feel like it was any kind of sub-plot as mentioned in other reviews.I did like Will Smiths performance as Dead-shot which fit in well with the plot and improved things for Enchantress vs the team but the cut/editing was just awful.The extended version should've just been released as normal but they have to charge extra for correcting their mistakes...and don't get me started on the soundtrack P.s. The endings felt lazily slapped up as well (Not a spoiler)",Suicide Squad
1700,seitun666,Awesome movie! more fun than i expected (more than BVS for sure),10,8 August 2016,"Well, yeah i loved Suicide Squad. To be honest its not much of an original idea/script, just a mix between The dirty dozen, Escape from New York and.... GHOSTBUSTERS (the original one)BUT yeah , its fun and kinda fresh coming from DC. Interesting flashbacks script, comes and goes, not a lineal story but at least there is no MARTHA kinda crap. Cant wait for DA director's cut or something like that. Its not BATMAN BEGINS nor THE DARK KNIGHT, but at least its not a pile of crap like BVS.Will smith its good, Harley Quinn its Awesome (very close to the animated character) and the rest of the guys well, they r OK. Batman only appear in flashbacks so i cant complain of affleck.Lotta shootings, explotions and fight scenes make this movie something to enjoy...of course if Ur not looking for superman having sex dressed in a bathup or batman crying for his mom.",Suicide Squad
1701,avossa,Haters gonna hate,8,21 August 2016,"Typical Superhero/villain movie with an average story. But the acting is well done, the effects are good and the art style is fantastic. Some characters are more highlighted than others but the same happened in Captain America Civil War. Though Slipknot was really unnecessary and the Joker could have had more screen time. Brilliant acting by Margot Robbie and Jared Leto as the movie couple of 2016. It is also an enrichment to the genre of superhero movies because the focus isn't on the superheros like in ALL the others.In my opinion the movie is on tie with the Marvel films which are also entertaining and not cinematic masterpieces, that's why I vote 8/10.",Suicide Squad
1702,nirzhormahmud,One of the worst movie of The DC Cinematic Universe,5,30 November 2016,"Really?! i can't believe what i have just saw. From where am I going to start? bad story, bad acting, bad cinematography, bad CGI, bad screenplay, everything around/related with this movie was ""bad"". I don't know how can people digest this movie after a year long hyped. I was eagerly wait for the performance of Jerad letto as a joker in this movie. but I'm calm now, cause its a stupidity to compare the Heath Ledgers' Joker with the J.Lettos' Joker. It's a light-years way difference between them. Don't get me wrong, i was hoped for psychopathic one not like this kind of gangsta/mafia boss joker. Rubbi as a Harley Quinn disappointed me also. The story line was pathetic! A witch going to burn the whole world down because she was not prayed as a god anymore!? really? if a witch can become a global threat then our human civilization should more emphasis on magic than science, because that's will be the only way to stop the Global warming! With all of their Global-level destroying power they just killed by simple bomb and Samurai sword. what a screw's up witches they are!? Screenplay was slow and sometime make me bored. overall, i just want to say that I'm disappointed with this movie and feeling little bit of skeptic about the upcoming DC comic based movies. Apparently, Marvel is doing far better job than DC in the cinematic universe. if DC never going to point out their mistakes from recent two big budgeted/over hyped movie failure, they will be regret it in future.",Suicide Squad
1703,ira-novianti,Well................ it's worth watching,6,4 August 2016,"When I watched BvS, I thought that was not great for DC but maybe Suicide Squad will make up DC reputation because the trailer was so cool and not typical. I was so excited waiting for this movie, hoping there would be big surprises waiting. It starts with introducing every character, flashbacks, powers, weaknesses. And the first half is solid, I like it. The act is good, especially Robbie, Leto, and Smith, but not so much with Captain Boomerang (which I don't really know what he is doing in this movie). And I like how they throw some jokes in there. But as the movie goes on, it turns out to be typical and a little bit cheesy. Well I don't know what, but it has the same not so good feeling to it like BvS, I call it DC cliché. I guess its the plot, or the weak conflict, or maybe because I put my hopes up too high for this movie, I don't know. The story is too weak for such strong and bad ass characters. Is it worth watching? Yes. Is it good? Yes. Is it good enough for super villain movie? Ummm ... sadly No. Just.... don't put your hopes up too high.",Suicide Squad
1704,bilgivighnesh190,"Had a potential to be a good movie,But still better than BvS",7,28 August 2016,"PROS: 1)Harley Quinn and Deadshot stole the spotlight Both of them acted beautifully! Margot Robbie acted true to character,and Will Smith played as... more of himself than his character.This supports the next point2)The Humor kept the ball rolling The movie had a good sense of humor. Majority of which was given by Harley and DeadshotCONS:1)JOKER was FALSELY ADVERTISED!When we saw the trailer for the Suicide Squad film,we presumed that The Joker will be the main villain in the movie ,even though he had less screen time , it was more compared to Batman and the Flash(HEY I GAVE YOU A SPOILER WARNING!),i.e his value to the movie was more of a cameo,or a side cast at best just like Batman/Flash.2)LESS ACTION SEQUENCES FOR THE MAIN BOSS FIGHTI know,I sounded like this as it was a video game,but honestly if you watch it,it looks like a video game.You got you heroes(i.e bad guys forced to be heroes)rounded up,kill a an army of bad guys and at the end you fight the main boss.OK,now back to the point. In the first half of the movie, El Diablo did not contribute to the fight due to guilt of accidentally killing his family and seeing what a danger to society he is.However he got his shot when he alone fights the brother of Enchantress,... it wasn't that great .. It would have looked a lot cooler though if the squad helped him out .However , Enchantress boss fight was too short,she just teleports here and there and then gives a cliché villainy speech ""JOIN ME or DIE!"" then gets deceived by Harley Quinn and takes her heart out. Finish..... Yeah that's it.3)Other than Deadshot and Harley Quinn:Barely any action scenes was shown for Killer Croc, Katana and Captain Boomerang .El Diablo is an exception. WHY I GAVE IT 7/10: Honestly I am comic book fan, so whatever I had expected from the books was well portrayed , so I was pleased to see them on the big screen.But due to cons mentioned above,he it didn't reach the hype we wanted.,ESPECIALLY the part where Joker wasn't the villain.",Suicide Squad
1705,romainmap,"Yes, I liked this movie.",7,4 November 2016,"I really liked Suicide Squad. Maybe because I wasn't expecting something big and sensational. I watched that movie as a spin-off, not as the giant blockbuster like most of people was expecting. I loved the cameos, the ""honour among thieves"" one in particular, with my all time favorite comic book character in it.Even if there are some editing issues in that part of the movie, I liked the opening with the presentation of the characters. Kinda reminded me the Watchmen opening. (Even if I think Watchmen is way better at all points!)There are a lot of trailers scenes that are missing in the final cut and I was a little bit disappointed because they're mostly about the Joker... Warner Bros. ? Ayer ? We'll probably never know. And with a eleven-minute long Extended Cut, I doubt we're going to see all of these.ROY.*PS : I'm French, and... not that good in English.

It is a great flick based on comics and is allot of fun.. bout all you really need to know right. So if you want to escape the crappy world around us for an hour or so go see it and have some fun. Don't expect Oscars, just some action, some popcorn, candy, cold drink, good company and a good time. That is what this movie provides, more than adequately.

1707,marianaramos-17919,A Mess,3,6 August 2016,"It started out great. The characters and their backstory were presented really good and they were interesting, it actually looked cool, the action scenes were good and the music was amazing.Margot Robbie was great, Will smith had some of the best lines and even Jay Courtney was good but by the middle i started realizing all its style and cool use of music was to compensate for horribly written dialogue and plot holes.What I hated the most? The guy that was never introduced but then suddenly he was on the squad just to be killed of, the cheesiness of the slow motion, the terrible jokes and awful dialogue, how they became a ""family"" and friends out of the freaking nowhere, how everyone just ignored diablo just died, how the whole premise relied on Waller being able to control Flag through his girlfriend because she was inevitably one with the enchantress in the end just as easy she was set free (in an incredibly cheesy scene). The batman scenes are awkward and out of place, Batman gritty version looked awkward inside a childish movie.And now, the Joker. Why on earth did the joker looked like a gangster trying too hard to be edgy? This was a horrible horrible rendition of the character. And i love Jared Leto. And this terrible characterization is more of a writing issue but still i was so disappointed. He was not awesomely mad and crazy he was just awkward... the whole movie he was a thug with money and a bunch of guys that worked with him for money. And his relationship with Harley Quinn was great on paper. But as portrait it looked so childish and non sense. With a more serious joker the same scenes would have been great, but this joker just overacted everything. And that laugh? Oh my god what a horrible laugh. It was not awesomely wicked, it was not hunting, it wasn't even the right amount of annoying, it was awkward.Honestly i just want to erase this movie out of my mind.",Suicide Squad
1708,rdebonosmith,Make your own opinion.,8,6 August 2016,"Wow. That is one word to describe this film. I have waited over a year for this film and I was definitely not disappointed. There were tears and laughter during the film from start to end and I just loved it. For all the people who haven't watched it...make sure you go in ignoring all the bad reviews because I must have seen a completely different film to them. This film had everything a superhero/villain fanatic wants. The squad is assembled of the worlds most infamous villains and it is up to them to help save the world from another villain...even typing this it doesn't seem to add up but believe me it does. The squad includes; Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie), Deadshot (played by Will Smith), El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez), Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courteney), Slipknot (played by Adam Beach), Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Katana (played by Karen Fukuhara), June Moone/Enchantress (played by Cara Delevingne) and Rick Flag (played by Joel Kinnaman). Obviously outside of the squad you have the King of Gotham - The Joker (played by Jared Leto).Overall, my favourite squad member is tough and it is between Deadshot and Harley because I feel those roles were played perfectly by the actors and you really felt connected to them even though they are villains. They really made the film what it was in my opinion. Everyone was worried about The Joker in the film due to the late Heath Ledger as he made that role his own and even I thought that no one can top that performance. Even though Jared Leto didn't top it...he made it his own and his Joker is as incredible and insane as ever. He left me speechless. In my opinion, make your own opinion, Mine is that when I left the cinema I wanted to go back in and watch it again just to have my mind blown a second time. But it is up to you.",Suicide Squad
1709,zlaf,"A great fun filled, comic accurate movie fun for the family (older kids)",9,15 August 2016,"Suicide Squad will remain as on of my newest favorite Comic Book film, falling behind the likes of Civil War, and even Batman v Superman. It even beats the likes of some of MARVEL's films in my opinion to include Iron Man 2, and even the Second THOR film. It gives a light but gritty tone, while giving laughs as much as possible. The acting was amazing, and I wish there would've been more Jared Leto as the Joker, as personally I like him even better than Ledger as the Clown Prince of Crime to be honest, only for the fact t hat I think Leto pulled a bit more from the comics with a nice twist of Ledger's style, but not to the point of being a copycat. Margot Robbie served as an amazing first live action Harley Quinn, with a decent outfit, and even the right amount of crazy, with just a bit of humanity left from the old Harleen she was. The hero Cameos were amazing, even if only brief. How Batman was pulled as the bad guy in a way for the villains. I also love how we are finally getting the Batman villains we deserve, with the likes of Deadshot, Harley, and even the infamous Killer Croc! I hope to see a lot more of them in the future DC live action films. The plot definitely seemed to jump right into it, seeming a bit rushed but semi appropriate I suppose. Other than the lack of Leto, and a bit of a rushed plot, Suicide Squad falls as one of the best zero to hero (or anti hero ig) films we have, personally even better than GotG.",Suicide Squad

Then the big baddie is revealed -- and it makes no sense. The wheels fell off the wagon from there. Dreadful. Absolutely dreadful.",Suicide Squad
1711,oliviaschlapfer,Best movie I have ever seen. It is AMAZING,10,4 August 2016,"This is by far my favorite movie ever. And I am quite surprised. I was looking forward to seeing it but was a bit put off by the horrible reviews it received. During and after the movie however, I marveled at the amazing acting, costumes, special effects, and overall story line. My favorite characters are most definitely the unstoppable duo that is the Joker and Harley Quinn. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie nailed their performances to a t. I know how intimidating it must have been to portray Mr J after Heath Ledger, but Leto was amazing (and very intimidating). The portrayal was believable, intriguing, and incredibly scary. I loved it! He only appears quite briefly but in the scenes he was in, he was outstanding! As for Robbie, she was a star and lit up the screen every time she appeared. The only ""negative"" part of this movie was Cara Delevingne's acting, which I felt was not up to par with the others and the importance of her character. Though in the end it didn't matter because Suicide Squad was amazing! I have no idea what the critics were thinking and am very confused as to why they hated it. I await the sequel with anticipation and hope that Mr J and Harley make more of an appearance.",Suicide Squad

The only thing that made this film OK was the joker. I freaking loved his scenes!!!! don't understand why he did not have more scenes in the movie!! I wish they would make a film only about the joker and Harley Quinn. The story line was weird and not very interesting. The best things about the movie were the songs, I adore the album, and the joker his acting was simply perfect way better than the other actors. I definitely think that they should make a movie about the joker that would be awesome.",Suicide Squad

Welp, let's just say I probably won't be buying it on DVD or anything. The story was blah and messy. However, I thought the characters were awesome. Harley Quinn was a bit overdone and a little cheesy at moments, but I love Margot, and thought she did pretty bad a! I would have loved for a stronger plot, an r-rating, and a more darker, more believable ""pyschcotic"" character from them, but hey, we can all be directors lol I'm not super disappointed, but man, this movie had way more potential. :(",Suicide Squad
1714,samopp,It Was.... Okay,4,11 August 2016,"To be honest, I wasn't planning on seeing this movie until I was invited by some friends. I was skeptical after reading some harsh critic reviews. After watching, I was slightly disappointed by Suicide Squad. Being an action film with such a large budget, you really can't fully flop. Still, DC struggles to make movies with a good plot and good editing without relying completely on action scenes. But, this film is not without its positives. First of all, I think the first 30 minutes of the film were quite enjoyable. After that point, things got colluded. Second, the casting of Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were excellent choices for their roles. Will Smith was the best choice for Deadshot, and his backstory was interesting and entertaining. Also, Margot Robbie nailed the role of Harley Quinn. Lastly, the bar scene was my favorite part of the movie. That scene helped me better understand each character. Now, the negatives. The pacing was the biggest issue for me. From the flashbacks to the rushed backstories, many things in this film didn't make sense. Specifically, the Joker's scenes were out of place. My second biggest issue is the setting. It seemed like the buildup to the ""boss battle"" took up 75% of the movie. It was just the same thing over and over. They run into bad guys, think about running away, save Captain Flag and then move on like nothing happened. This highlights the predictability of this movie. Another issue I had was some of jokes that everyone else in the theater thought were ""laugh out loud"" funny. The humor seemed kind of forced. Last but definitely not least, the ending was so campy it annoyed the hell out of me. The slow motion ending leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. Personally, I walked out of the theater thinking that this movie was just ""okay"". An ""eh"" villain, okay special effects and the waste of the Joker contributed to the overall lack of caring about this film. I'm not a Marvel fanboy by any means. But, Marvel leaves you feeling satisfied and DC leaves you feeling like something is missing. The critics were a little harsh in my opinion, but were pretty justified in their reviews. Suicide Squad was just average.",Suicide Squad
1715,bonnojacobs,A mess,4,9 August 2016,"Like most reviewers, I enjoyed the first 20 minutes. It had a fun tone. It felt like a movie that wasn't going to take itself too serious (like, dare I say it, Deadpool). But then... it does.It's hard to even begin where this movie goes wrong, but I'll give it a try. So many characters are shoehorned in that you don't really get to know any of them. They become one-dimensional characters with stupid one-liners. Especially Harley Quinn's sad attempts at being funny. It's cringe worthy. They try to rush the story forward, while also trying to build its characters. This is done with flashbacks that sometimes pop up so randomly and appear to hold no bearing on the story or the character for that matter(!). They're more like visual anecdotes, that contain stupid trivia. It's at this point that you realize things are only going downhill from here. The action is lackluster (and doesn't even get the chance to shine because the whole movie is set in a dark, rainy environment). The acting is downright bad (yes, even Leto's Joker and Robbie's Quinn). Only Will Smith's Deadshot and Viola Davis' Amanda Waller were great. They really carried this movie and made it bearable.As for the plot. There wasn't really any. I could go on about how big of a mess this movie is and how the villain was stupid, but frankly I don't want to waste any further time discussing this...",Suicide Squad
1716,philiptheguy,A good kind of disaster,8,3 August 2016,"So I seen the movie, in an early premier at my local theater. Such excitement I thought the movie would bring. I sat down with a large popcorn and soda. My two favorite DC villains were there, Joker and Harley Quinn. But when the movie started... Oh it was a disaster. A good kind of disaster of course. First of all the prince of madness, the clown himself the brand new joker. Is a new kind of joker. Jared Leto. Is a perfect candidate to play the mad driven trickster. Astonishing performance all around. For the other cast mates astonishing performance through and through as well. Now for the movie, the movie was a disaster, I feel as if the Film wanted to have a little compromise between the marvel's light and yet action packed thriller with laughs all around. That's what I thought, It's a dark sinister film, but I feel as if they were trying to make a little more ""marvel"" tone to the aspect of this film. But overall if you want to see a villain movie where the villains do good things for an early prison release so in turn they can do more bad things when they release. It's a good movie. It is definitely worth the watch and buy.",Suicide Squad
1717,daluke-81851,Better than BvS,10,7 August 2016,I was very disappointed with BvS and was skeptical about Suicide Squad but it was great. The characters were outstanding and it had a lighter tone than the previous movies which was desperately needed. Will Smith was superb in it but Margot Robbie and Jared Leto shine as Harley Quinn and The Joker. It's like no other movie in the DCEU or the MCU. It's good funny moments too. I don't get why the critics rate the movie so low.The Joker is barely in the movie which was a little disappointing. I am eager to see more especially since in this movie he's just Harley's boyfriend. Which is understandable since the movie isn't really even about The Joker it's about Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Batman makes nothing more than a few cameos and a scene after the mid-credits. The villain wasn't the best but the characters more than make up for it. The soundtrack was phenomenal. This movie is better than MOS and BvS. Hopefully DC is learning from their mistakes and Wonder Woman and Justice League will also be spectacular.,Suicide Squad
1718,vitorle99,"It's not that ""good"" or that ""bad"".",7,26 January 2019,"Great actors portraying good villains, anti-heroes. The movie does not have a fearful or scary enemy to fight against, would rather have Joker as a bad guy, instead of Enchantress. Although, the humor in the movie, is perfectly fine, since the beginning until the end of it. However it could have done better...(one example) exploring Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, already thinking at the public (who doesn't read Comic Books) to know who they are and also thinking on the sequel plot. I do believe a Comic book movie with great characters cannot just have, the spotlight locked on two or three characters, because the actors are incredibly famous. Must be equally balanced (time on the screen), a great example about this, is Fury. The movie has perfect timing, and show us how to introduce the characters without wasting a single second.",Suicide Squad
1719,micahkonzen,Over-hyped but still a must-see,7,5 August 2016,"With what may be the best movie marketing campaign of all time, over-hype is sure to come. This is the case for Suicide Squad. People were expecting something on the level of a Christopher Nolan Dark Knight film, and weren't okay when a good, not great, summer blockbuster was released. There is a lot of good things in this film to be grateful for. Every major character was great and a clear perfect fit for the future of the DC universe. Deadshot, played by Will Smith, was absolutely superb. His one liners were great, and he showed true poise in a position of leadership with the group. Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), your all-American man, seemed like something taken straight off the comic book page. It was a solid performance with close to no flaws. Many of the minor characters seemed to hit the ground running as well. Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, El Diablo, and Katana although not getting nearly the screen time as Harley and Deadshot, all did solid jobs in securing their positions for future films. Now for the standouts, Amanda Waller, Harley Quinn, and Joker. Three brilliant performances played by three brilliant actors. Not a lot needed to be said. They'll make you feel a range of emotions while keeping you thoroughly entertained. Viola Davis shines as the harsh and cruel Amanda Waller while Margot Robbie displays perfectly the crazy within the head of Harley Quinn. Her performance was by far the best of them all and will leave the audience craving more. Now the Joker, played by Jared Leto was interesting. It is obvious there will be mixed feelings towards his take on the iconic character but personally I thought his bizarre and humanized take on the psychopath was great. Although the cast was great, of course the movie had its flaws. Without giving away any spoilers, the entire villain plot was a mess and felt extremely rushed. There was very little back story or character development for this character. Thankfully this was the only character with a shallow backstory. The CGI in this case was pretty weak as well. Although in no ways horrible, it was vastly clear that DC hasn't reached the level of CGI accuracy that the Marvel Universe has. The other major problem with this movie was the editing. Cheesy one liners followed by awkward scene cutting or weak transitions lead to a couple legitimate cringe worthy moments. The storyline had great potential but seemed to be skewered by irrelevant characters and poorly cut together scenes. All in all though this movie is still a must see. The future of the squad is promising due to the great cast and strong backstories of ever major character. Although there were some obvious weaknesses, the entertaining action mixed with real emotion and plentiful laughs came together to make a solid summer blockbuster definitely worth your time.",Suicide Squad
1720,devil_jam,Horrible... Stay with the comics!,1,7 August 2016,"Just like any comic book made into a movie. I keep asking myself, WHY? Take a page out from Netflix. Make it a series with low budget actors and you'll get more out of it. But I guess you don't do it for the fans. You do it for the money you want to take from the fans. You cant put 20 mins of back stories then an hour and a half of running around shooting things and lame jokes only to disappoint us. The more you make this crap the more I will go read more books and graphic novels. I wish I could say nicer things about a movie that I was looking more forward to seeing Joker than anything else..

If you are a 10-year old marvel fan, this one is not for you, however, if you're 15 o over, this is one of the best comic book adopted movies I have seen. It is ""Straight Outta Comics"" show.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was amazing and Will Smith has mastered Deadshot in the movie.I should say there isn't much about Jared Leto's Joker, given his less than expected screen time, but I liked what I say.Cara Delevingne is quite the biggest gossip diva and I shall admit her acting was up to the mark as well.I'm happy that David Ayer didn't make it a Comedy Circus we know as Captain America : Civil War",Suicide Squad

1723,cta-26894,A failed attempt by DC to mimic the Avengers franchise,4,6 August 2016,"So, Suicide Squad was a below average movie. 4/10.The GOOD: Visually appealing. I was really impressed with how spot on the effects and stylized scenes were. Soundtrack comprised of already established popular songs worked well with these scenes in the beginning of the movie, despite their frequency. Delivery of all lines of dialogue (even the terrible ones) were great and well-acted.Will Smith as Deadshot was the most entertaining character on screen... and Margot Robbie as Harley was the hottest thing under the sun (and I really mean that) as you had to admit it out loud, sometimes. Her mannerisms went well with her overall acting performance despite flat writing. El Diablo was the most engaging and most developed out of the lot of supporting, less popular characters. A few overall chuckles and short scenes of some really cool moments. Little nods to the already established DC lore were there.The BAD: Jared Leto's Joker was one of the most unconvincing performances I've ever seen in any sort of film in a long time. Not once did I ever feel like his Joker could be realistically intimidating or hold enough bravado to impress any of his criminal cohorts and right-minded female viewers, alike - with such unconvincing 'tough guy' acting. His makeup and costume wasn't half bad but I couldn't help but feel he was trying WAY too hard and his face way too smooth and gentle looking to be Joker. Croc also sucked for the most part. Every other character just seemed pretty average as they got left behind in Deadshot's huge shadow nearly every other scene, for better or for worse.Character clichés were here and there, alongside frequent cringe-tastical writing. I shook my head during some lines, even though the performance of the respected actors were more often than not, perfect, but when the dialogue was bad... it was BAD. The overall story could've been done better. There's some nonsensical plot elements for what was provided and better writing could've been made for a movie with such an interesting premise. I feel like a lot more could've been done with it - and if the events of the plot were on a smaller, tight-knit, more behind-the-scenes scale rather than another ""the world is doomed plot"", I think I would've believed it to be more of an interesting movie. By the time it was over, I didn't feel invested and just wanted to leave.Yeah, the movie kinda sucked. Wouldn't watch it again. Thanks for that, DC.",Suicide Squad
1724,esteband-96438,"a good movie, a bad joker",7,14 August 2016,"First of all i think that this movie is way better than every movie in this new cinematic dc universe. Suicide Squad is not perfect, but is really funny and it has excellent scenes. In my opinion there is one thing wrong in the movie, i mean horrible, i hated it, and its Jared Leto's Joker. The Joker here is the worst of all cinematic jokers, its like a punk gangster and oh my god his laughing is terrible. I think that without his metallic teeth it could been better. Suicide Squad is a success. Will Smith is great, Margot Robbie is great and everyone is great in this crazy film. It has a very good soundtrack and i think you will love it.Sorry for my English, i hope you understand what i want to say.DUNANDSON",Suicide Squad
1725,viniciuscorreia,"They are the bad guys, but they made a perfect movie!",6,2 August 2016,"Oh my god! What a wonderful movie! I really don't know what's wrong with the critics. Definitely, we didn't see the same movie. Suicide Squad is one of the best super-hero movies I ever saw. Amazing script, amazing actors and amazing direction. It's incredible the way that David Ayer made the interaction of the characters between themselves. I will write below about the ""stars"" of Suicide Squad. (KEEP CALM! THERE'S NO SPOILERS!)The Joker: Jared Leto is one of the best living actors. You really think he's crazy on real life because his voice, his maniac look, and his facials expressions are not from a sane person. I'm sorry Cesar Romero and Heath Ledger, but Jared Leto is the real Joker, he seems that he escaped from the comics, like Jack Nicholson did, and is on the real world. I cried like a kid who earned his first bike. Amazing, amazing and amazing!Harley Queen: I'm in love with Margot Robbie. Her sweet voice, sweet face and sweet personality made her a personification of the Animated Series' Harley Queen. At the right moment she's very violent. Her interaction with Jared is beautiful. Although he treats her as a tool, he loves her. Deadshot: The classic Will Smith from action movies: tough, make us laugh a bit, and worried with his family. I remembered his character on ""I Am Legend"". I really liked.Captain Boomerang: Man, this guy deserves to be on the Flash movie. He's very very funny, a real troglodyte and a crazy bastard. A perfect villain.Batman: I though he appears more, but what really matters is: Ben Affleck is the best Batman. The scene where he persecutes Joker and Harley will make fans cry of emotion. I won't explain each character because you must see them with your own eyes. Please, don't listen the bad critics and go watch Suicide Squad! You will not regret!P.S. If you are asking yourself if Suicide Squad is better than Batman vs Superman, the answer is YES.",Suicide Squad
1726,bradfuller-23850,I don't know whether to blame the writers or the director,2,1 September 2016,"for full disclosure: I walked out just after they'd all had ""Escape from New York"" explosives injected and had all met up for the first time. Maybe it got better after that... Watching this movie was like reading a first-time author's novel, where he/she feels the need to give the reader 4 pages of back-story the first time the character appears.I don't care about their unhappy past life - if any of it is relevant to THIS story then show me as I need it...And not for nothing, but if I already know the backstories of the Suicide Squad members then it's all wasted on me, and if I don't know the backstories it's not essential to the movie that I should learn it all NOW.I could care less about the star-crossed lovers, or the born-again fire- demon or the heartless killer who loves his daughter.On the plus side - I thought there were a few funny lines and maybe there was something better to come from that later. But by this point there was way too long to wait and see.And the plot devices - I realise it's based on Comic books but for pete's sake is the target audience supposed to be 14 year old boys? (and if so you need more and better looking women villains I think)Take from this what you will. I went into this movie expecting very little and left early having received even less.Your Mileage May Vary (tm)",Suicide Squad
1727,boogyknightz,bad acting and so stupid that style can't save it.,4,15 August 2016,"I may or may not include a spoiler so as to protect myself for after I'm done I'll check the box for now. Will Smith is not a dimensional actor. He is the same in everything like a Samuel l Jackson. No depth to his character is developed at all. They try to make it look like his bad guy is good too. Harley uses a bat. It's so stupid that style can't save it. Focuses on dead shot who is will smith. He is a terrible actor. Stereotypical all the way but I'm sure would not want to be adhered to a stereotype. Typical hypocrite. It's a movie also based on Harley Quinn. The style of the scenes, the title and all of the colors are reminiscent of a Harley who is also a suicide girl model of some sort. Sex couldn't sell a good rating on this. Went in figuring it may not be good and wasn't surprised. Was excited after the first trailer but then the second trailer made me sink into reality. Usually when I go in not expecting much a movie can be surprisingly great but this isn't. The guy who plays the special forces soldier is a bad actor too. To be fair the girl played a good Harley Quinn but who cares about that. Leto could have played a much better joker. I wonder what made him that way when I usually like his performances. The joker wasn't my main concern of bad acting though. Will smith ruined it for me. I like to see someone actually research and prepare themselves and get into character rather than just be like I'm going out there as myself they gonna pay me anyways. Total ego garbage from talentless idiots these days only there to add diversity to the screen rather than additional talent. Action wasn't that impressive. Would have liked to have seen more kitana action though. Characters needed more to them to make it seems like they can really do damage. Some kind of real background even added if need be. Don't get your hopes up for this. It will let you down. They designed it to being people out to make their money back and hype sells everything unfortunately so there is no punishment for them making us excited for what they knew was not any good. I will say if you haven't anything else to do its kind of worth a watch. I think from now on I'll pass on watching a movie if I know will smith is in it. Try to enjoy this movie though.",Suicide Squad

They tried to address weak character development this with a ""hockey card"" (excuse my Canadianess) type bio at the beginning of each character introduction. Also the villain/villains were not interesting at all and should of been 1 and not 2. Someone needs to let the producer know that sometimes less is more. Seemed like they tried to introduce too many characters at once.

There were thinking gs said that just either didn't seem necessary, or awkward. Nothing best that bar scene, though. Awkward to the extreme. I felt like they just needed to get this weird storytelling bit out of the way, and so they jotted something down and threw it in the movie. It was so strange. Don't get me wrong, it was fairly funny but the writing could have been so much better. I'll probably see this again once it's on DVD, just because that's how nice it was to look at. My conclusion is you should definitely go see it, because you can just tell so much work was put into this. The actress who played Enchantress really just blew me away.",Suicide Squad

Especially Will Smith as Deadshot, he really surprised me. Jared Leto as the Joker is not in it as much as I wanted him too but that's fine.

Hayden Christensen lifeless).Script is awful and they rewrote the script for the thousandth time. Editing seems to be done by blind drunks. - CGI is worse than PLAYSTATION 2.Ending is....... well bad is all I can say. Jared leto's joker remembered me Joel schumacher's villains.

In conclusion, its a good summer movie to watch with friends and have a good laugh with good fight scenes.

This movie was amazing! I can't wait to see it again. The way the interaction between Jared Leto and Margot Robbie was pure chemistry like something I have never seen before. A movie that is made in such a unique fashion that it teeters on being the beginning of something solid and fresh among the recent over saturation of comic book movies trying to tie one to the other.

1740,croelants,"Waaaauuuuw, what a ride!",9,6 August 2016,"I LOVE this movie. To me, as a comic book and superheroes animated fan, DC nailed it again Because I also LOVE the two previous DCEU movies despite of all the bad critics and no, I don't hate Marvel movies, I also LOVE Marvel movies. I just see them as two different visionaries on their take of superheroes. It's like comparing Disney animated movies with Dreamworks or Japanese Manga. They have similarities but are not the same. I see a lot of bad critics mentioning Marvel movies in their reviews and that Warner Bros should learn from them etc blablabla.. I really hope WB will not listen to them and keep on track with what they are doing, because if I'm going to watch a DC movie, I want to get a DC movie. The DCEU is like Ginger ale to me and Marvel is like a Coke. I love to drink a Coke and I love to drink some ginger ale. But strangely there are people who are drinking ginger ale and think it should taste like a coke. Anyway back to Suicide SquadBringing comic book and animated heroes to live action, is something very hard to do without making it too slapstick and silly. What may work in comic books and in animated movies, will definitely not always work in live action. But with Suicide Squad all the quirkiness works out pretty well Why??? Because. It's Suicide Squad a bunch of deranged villains with powers and/or abilities in a world where there are meta humans, magic and the fracking Justice League with Batman. DC Comic book fans will certainly see all the cameo's and understand the story line. I saw an actually story arc of Enchantress and Diablo and they used the Suicide Squad to tell it. These two characters are the least known to most people, but I saw what they were doing with these two characters throughout the movie and for me as a true fan it was mind blowing. For the people who have never read a DC comic book ever, if you take this movie too seriously, don't. Just sit back, enjoy the ride because you are in for a mind blowing soundtrack throughout the movie and an amazing fun time with all the characters. Warner Bros does not play it safe, but they stay true to the heart and soul of the DC Comics and they sure deliver to the true fans with this awesome movie.

1741,chrisdossantosscott,Really Disappointing: A David Ayers film?,4,11 August 2016,"I went in expecting the grit and realism of a David Ayers film. I mean of course! that's why the hired him! But unfortunately the film under-preformed and should not be called such. To be fair some scenes of the film do capture that realistic and serious tone that entices me to be a DC fan. To know these characters (Hero or Villain) can be as dysfunctional and as vulnerable as myself. Ultimately the film is buried somewhere underneath Character Cards, careless editing, and unnecessary CGI. A Golden David Ayer film is left somewhere on the cutting room floor.The film is cut only leave you to care for only three characters, Deadshot(Will Smith), Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), and Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), All who's stories I still feel weren't logically explained or flushed. The rest of the squad is left with little to no lines. (Poor Adewale in that mask for 12 to 14 hours of the day to do two sneers, a lick, and practically ONE line).The Joker is almost irrelevant, and only serves Harley Quinn's story purpose with no more than 7 min screen time, which would have been fine if I felt like he didn't try to serve a bigger purpose in the plot of the film. Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) was unexplained entirely (Motivations, Backstory none of it) and in one scene literally made me facepalm thinking ""What the F- -- just happened?...they cut it""Overall the cast performance is exemplary, leaving you feeling as though there was more than what you payed for. The shots and dialogue are both blunt and razor sharp keeping the film about VILLAINS intact, the action sequences are to rave about, so sincerely THANK YOU David AYER for giving these characters life. But It is on the editing floor that this film fails, like Batman V. Superman it leaves the audience thinking ""Did I miss something?"" ""Is this the whole film?"". All from having music where it shouldn't be and score where it shouldn't belong. So much story/ flashbacks are either missing or rushed through, It makes me wonder ""Who greenlit this cut to hit theaters?"". I payed for a film by David Ayer, NOT Trailer Park.

I believe this movie to be a nice transition from David Ayer's past movie line up where they focused more on a lot of grit, action, crime, and drama. I'm not saying Suicide squad doesn't have any action because there is a lot of it but what I am saying is its nice to see a director get out of his comfort zone by taking on a movie, more specifically a comic-book movie which focuses on action and comedy. One addition to this movie that I really enjoyed was the music. I found myself lip syncing the words during every transition when a new song played in the background. There are familiar songs that most notably will be recognized by a more mainstream audience. The actors and characters are not to go un-noticed either. Even though Will Smith practically plays himself as the role of deadshot, it still doesn't take out the fact that you sort of like him and root for him to succeed in the long run. Margot Robbie as Haley Quinn will probably be most audience goers choice as the stand out of the whole movie which I do agree on at some aspects but the one character I feel I liked the most was Diablo. His character just appealed to me the most and I found myself wanting to see more of him on screen. Lastly I know most people who haven't scene the movie yet will probably be wondering about the Joker. All I can say is without spoiling it for you is that you will want to see more of him. Suicide squad is worth a watch whether it is in theaters or your streaming it at home, especially now that there will be an extended cut coming out soon.",Suicide Squad

There is absolutely no reason to hate anything about Suicide Squad. This movie was fun and very entertaining, which is what movies are suppose to be. I laugh when I see some of these reviews of normal people just going to the theater and analyzing every little flaw in the movie as if they are professional directors. There's no reason why this movie should have such a low critic score. If you want to watch this movie, go see it and judge for yourself. Don't let people to hate on most movies as their career to steer you away from watching this summer blockbuster. The characters are fantastic, especially Harley Quinn, Deadshot and the Joker. Seeing Batman in the movie made it that much better. I love comics and I love DC and i think director David Ayer did it justice. I personally hope we see more movies with Leto's Joker in it.

1747,madmasker,trainwreck of ego battles,1,12 August 2016,"with all of the hype generated around the commitment of the actors to their roles, this movie really boils down to a handful of actors all jockeying for a chance to steal the show and possibly launch a film franchise. you have will smith trying to steal the show with a lovable father/worlds greatest assassin (does he take her with him on his constant international travels? ya think?) with a heart of gold representation of deadshot. but the film maker also decided to really commit to the harley quinn narrative, and in order to introduce her to the audience as well, they needed an origin story to compel the new audience members to connect to her. which meant that the joker had to come along for the ride, and of course in order to play the joker you have to deal with the fact that the last guy knocked it out of the ballpark, and you will never live up to that. which seems to have motivated Jared Leto to latch on to an extremely undeserved ego trip over his character. he is a supporting character to a side narrative, and yet he battled to turn himself into a central character by ""sacrificing"" for the role so much the director felt compelled to shoe horn in some more screen time. when in all honesty, it would have been WAY more compelling and creepy if this movie had not even revealed who the next joker would be, by always playing the joker as a shadow figure. that way the obsession and devotion that harley gets to play with is projected on to a character that is unknowable and unrelatable to any of the audience. it would have really given room for her to explore the depths of harleys idol worship if the joker had essentially been ""kaiser soze"" for one film. but instead we got a hot topic die antwood and a cutesey bad boy crush. meanwhile a slew of lesser known actors are all desperately trying to get noticed by committing so hard to their characters they ended up making it all about themselves. what you end up with is a shallow caricature development movie with a bunch of off brand comic book characters who's backstory needs to be shoe horned in to a feature length film. on top of bad writing, and over over the top character choices. the look of the film was reminiscent of 1987's Masters of the Universe. for an action and visual effects driven story, there seems to have been given very little effort toward filming it in a visually interesting way. in fact the very few cinematically artistic moments that appear in the film are all devoted to the sub plot with harley and the joker. which is only supposed to be harleys origin story, not the main focus of the whole film. the rest of the film has lots of poorly lit battle sequences in city streets, with propane poofers back lighting rubber suited stunt men. oh, and there are a ton of random laser shots flying around for good measure....",Suicide Squad

An urban contemporary grounded super villain film....this one has no heroes even though they do do some good in the end! If you have seen it you will know what I mean. I don't get the critics to be honest. I know where they are coming form but in no way is their logic making any sense. They have been overly critical once again and unfairly of a very good solid film. No way Ghostbusters is better than this flick. The critics have lost their minds or they have an agenda to sink the DC. The audience is going to scratch their heads after seeing this movie and wonder what the hell the critics were watching. The critics are trying to poison the waters of this innovative movie. You will see this style copied by other CBM's in the future for sure. It is a ground breaker.",Suicide Squad
1749,corvette-38561,Great movie,10,7 August 2016,"Just saw suicide squad.I loved it.I been reading suicide squad comic for yrs and it was very accurate.screw critics.go see for yourself.it's a fun movie trust me!! It's great all around.it's not a bad film.don'tu believe critics.it has just right amount of humor.it's great I can't say it enough.it's better than I expected.great cameos too.go see it for yourself.I like all dc films but I'm saying it to ya this is good.it's not guardians of galaxy rip off or should it try to be.some don't understand that dc has different feel than marvel.dc can't do things the marvel way and m glad.dc gets unfair treatment from critics who don't get dc.they are very different than marvel.so go see it.I think most of you will like it.it's pleasant surprise.the summary of the film is this,Waller wants to start a project to help fight the next superman if he turns out bad.so she assembles the squad.joker is good in it.Harley is great.will smith was good too.I think they were all good.to sum it up they put bad guys together to fight a so so villain.but still well worth your ten bucks.Batman is in it so that's a plus also has flash cameo.the ending was great and watch the mid credits scene with Bruce and waller",Suicide Squad
1750,himynameisrach,"A movie that squandered so much potential despite an abundance of source material, a multitude of great characters to play with and a brilliant cast at its disposal.",5,8 August 2016,"{SPOILERS!!}Suicide Squad fails to deliver a memorable story line and at times failed the most interesting assets they had, the characters. Having said that, Suicide Squad is an okay, watchable movie – not as bad some of the critics reviews would have you believe, but no where near as good as you wanted it to be. The film begins by briefly introducing us to a few of the main 'villains' in prison, accompanied by a sometimes out of place soundtrack, before quickly diving into Viola Davis' character, Amanda Waller, explaining that she ""Wants to build a team of some very bad people, who she believes can do some good"", which unfortunately doesn't extend much past what you will have seen in the adverts. In fact, a couple of the 'back stories' are reduced to sequences stretching to just a little over 30 seconds, including Killer Crocs' - one of the movies most under utilized characters, whose entire contribution to film comes down to a few grunts and incomprehensible words (not to mention the fact his head regularly looked far too big for his body). The film then continues on for a while to basically just be a sequence of strangely pasted together sound clips of popular songs, but not much more.Eventually, Enchantress (played by Cara Delevingne, the TopShop model), who I guess is the antagonist, takes over New York City and creates a massive energy ball around herself for a reason I'm unsure of (Maybe it was explained, maybe It mattered so little that I didn't take note) and patiently awaits for the Suicide Squad to arrive – who have been brought together and sent to fight what they have been told is a 'terrorist' - an element of the movie I felt could have been utilized more, it may not have been the directors angle but having the Suicide Squad be the answer to a more relatable 'terrorist' could have engaged a bigger conversation and related to current issues in a way that the X-Men franchise has done in the past – just my opinion. They've been sent to save one unnamed individual. This individual turns out to be Viola Davis (Amanda Waller) herself, who has sent them to save herself. I'm unsure of why she was near the Enchantress in the first place, or why she goes on to kill the team she was working with there. My main problem with the movie was not the uninspired plot, or the senseless destruction and presence of the antagonist and it wasn't even the sub standard story telling methods by the director, but the lack of both character development and character relationships. The only members of the Suicide squad that really interacted with one another were Will Smith and Harley Quinn. When it comes to the scene where Deadshot is asked to Shoot and Kill Harley Quinn, as she attempts to escape with the Joker, he misses (on purpose, given that he 'never misses'), but even by this scene the movie has failed to development any sense of loyalty between the characters so Deadshots' decision appears out of character to the point it could almost be described as a plot hole. Another moment, later on in the movie, that really emphasizes the lack of development between the characters, was the moment Diablo finally dives into any action (minus his one other fire scene earlier on in the movie that Deadshot aggravates him into, which you will have seen in the trailers) and exclaims 'I've already lost one family, I won't lose another'. This statement seems so out of place given that Diablo at this point has not properly interacted with any of the members of the Suicide Squad, minus his aforementioned run in with Deadshot. I can only assume that in an earlier version of the script we would have seen the members form some sort of allegiance to one another, but watching this final edit I would never have guessed that was ever the movies intentions. With all that being said, the movie does have some redeeming qualities, most noticeably in the casting. Will Smith plays, well, Will Smith, but nether-the-less gives a charismatic performance of Deadshot, who I think, if anyone, is meant to be a protagonist. Margot Robbie delivers a great and unpredictable performance as Harley Quinn, but much more could have been done with her screen time. It felt like Margot ""got"" Harley Quinn and is more than capable of making Harley Quinn her own – but the story and script let her down and failed to make it a breathtaking performance. Jared Leto brought his own Comic-book inspired take on The Joker, which again I felt was let down by the direction, rather than by Leto. In this movie The Joker is portrayed as no more than a strangely decorated mafia man, with a noticeable absence of any 'dark humor' or mental complexity, which is what usually makes The Joker such a fascinating character. What I would really like to see is Letos' Joker and Margot Robbie' Harley Quinn have a film of their own under a new director, because the potential is there. A little less jumped up Mafia Hit Man, and a little more of their relationship in the ""Arkham"" series of video games, and we might be on to something great.Overall it feels that DC and Warner Bros have absolutely everything they need to create brilliant, even cult-classic movies but are consistently failing to deliver on even the basic levels of blockbuster storytelling – and on this occasion have produced only an okay movie, but with zero re-watch value.",Suicide Squad
1751,freddiebeatty-23262,Probably the best movie I have ever seen,7,5 August 2016,"*there is only a very mild spoiler in this. The paragraph about the characters has a small spoiler about a scene with Harley*I don't know what movie they showed the critics that rated this so badly. I know it had a few mistakes, but it was no where near the hate that it got.I am a huge Dc fan, I like marvel too, but Dc is just better in my opinion. Ever since I heard about the Suicide Squad movie I have been looking it up everyday to see pictures and stuff. When the first trailer came out, I was so excited. When the movie came out I thought it was not going to reach my expectations, but it exceeded them by a million miles.The characters are amazing. Harley was spot on to the comics, *Mild Spoiler* they even showed her in the traditional suit for a scene, it was amazing. The famous picture online of the joker and Harley dancing with the creepy grin and her jester suit on was basically reenacted in this movie and it was so good, they even had her jester hat on in the scene! *spoiler over* All the other characters were so good. In my opinion, Even though the Joker wasn't in it as much as many people would have wanted, I thought that he was the best on screen Joker, Ever! He is straight up insane, he is scary, charming in a way, smart, and everything you would want for the joker. He is definitely the closest Joker to the comics played on screen. Everybody else, again, was amazing!The soundtrack for the movie was spectacular. If you don't want to go for the story, go for the music, because it was amazing.All in all, it was definitely my favorite movie I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot. I had a great time, and I had a grin on my face the entire movie and on the entire ride back home! Definitely go see this, it will change your look on the dc universe.",Suicide Squad

Everything waz too good and I believe DC has finally done it. But I lived Amanda Waller she was sooo bad.Pros - Script - Effects - ActorsAmazing Movie EverCons - Could have been longer and extended the story",Suicide Squad
1753,wwwbrady,"Worst Heroes Ever? No, Entertainingly FUN!!....",10,5 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a really fun, entertaining movie, not perfect but entertainingly fun. Will Smith as Deadshot is spot on fun as always. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is really entertaining, hands down the best part of the movie, makes you want to see more of her. Jared Leto's take on the Joker was different from previous portrayals, he did a really great job on his role even though he didn't have much screen time, the desire to see that menacing feel he has when he's on screen, makes you desire to see him soon in the near future. Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang, with his funny antics. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc,a man with few words but, when he does say something it's hilarious. Karen Fukuhara as Katana, she wasn't explored much and didn't say much, though Karen did seem to look the part of Katana, will be great if she's explored more in a future film. Jay Hernandez as El Diablo, was really the surprise of the squad, he literally was the one who made the squad focus. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, fantastic, she's menacing as it gets, straight forward too, hope to see more of her. Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag was one word, phenomenal can't say more. Now of course with every movie it will have it's flaws.... Adam Beach as Slipknot, his portrayal seem to come out of nowhere, he literally was just brought in, wasn't mention how or why, about five minutes later, he's dead, word is WB cut many scenes from the movie, hope sometime soon there is an explanation for this. Cara Delevinge as Enchantress/ Dr. June Moone, can't say much about her portrayal as Dr. June Moone she didn't really say much. As Enchantress she was a bit underwhelming as a lead villain though at least she didn't have some corny lines as some villains in other superhero films do, everything was there to have had her portrayed a convincing villain, sadly it wasn't taken advantage of, Would of been great if the main villain would of been Jared Leto's Joker right from the get go. As a movie as a whole, it wasn't amazing but it sure was great, from it's dark tone to it's lighthearted moments, it isn't as bad as critics say, i do recommend watching these Worst Heroes Ever....",Suicide Squad
1754,ringking2006,Pretty Amazingly Cool But Not Diggin The Joker,8,6 August 2016,"May Be Spoilers Ahead Just A Warning.All this B V S hate was a bit silly. I gladly take what 4th biggest movie of the summer. I seriously don't get the doom and gloom of critics for these DC projects. Now that aside Suicide Sqade was pretty fun and you felt for these bad villains.Robbie and Harley Quinn , AAA as Croc and The Diablo Character stole this movie. Amanda Waller was the real villain really. Anyways the movie has some minor issues and thats what keeps it equal rating too B V S. The Director set up characters in this movie better then Marvel does because no Marvel Villain do you feel for. David Ayer needs too give Marvel casting and villain creating pointers.However The Joker Just was a miss for me. Im sorry but Leto made The Joker a over sexed looking Painting Clown more then A Real Joker. Affleck needs too maybe consider a different Joker for His Batman movie.The Villain Witch or Goddess stuff needed more story work really but the movie does not suffer any effects by story plot because the cast is so good. Wanna see A Sequel with a batman reluctant team up because of Deadshot and Batmans dislike set up in this movie. Movie was fun but still liked Deadpool a bit more.

1755,brentp-12199,"Crazy, fun, indulgence. Suicide Squad for many years to come.",10,5 August 2016,"To be direct and simple, this was a great movie that followed the comic story arches well. Its a blast start to finish, feels like you had just sat down when it ends, and that is impressive for a 2 hr film. I want the general audience to realize that this is a comic book movie, almost a new 52 movie, and if you enjoy source material it is phenomenal. Even if you don't read the comics, this is a SATISFYING film, rare, with tons of action and tons of characters with very individual personalities. My final verdict is this is a great movie that could have been hands down the best comic movie of all time with an R rating. Jared Leto makes for a unique joker that we just want to see more of, Margot is maybe the best Harley Quinn anyone will ever achieve, El diablo, Boomerang, and Killer Croc have time to shine as well and David Ayer is a genius to get us to care about one of them let alone them all and yet we want so much more. Cant wait to see SUICIDE SQUAD 2. Flawless all things considered.",Suicide Squad
1756,peto-05241,Disappointing,5,9 August 2016,"So the trailers had me believe that this is actually a great film. David Ayer had me believe that as well with his career. So what happened? Well, DC decided to screw things up in the editing, not realizing, the movie wasn't any good either while it was still being written. I am not putting the blame on Ayer, he apparently was trying to make something better, but I am, however, dumping all the blame on DC and also Warners who probably did not care as much. I know a rant like this won't help but I really wanted to like the movie and...they disappointed me with the final product. Also, I don't understand how can people be so blind about the film's quality. I did not really care about the characters. I don't see what is so awesome about Harley. Most importantly - I don't understand the lack of criticism from fans. This film is supposed to be connecting some of the other DCEU films and it sucks. Why are praising it so much???",Suicide Squad
1757,partot,Overall an enjoyable experience,5,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad, although first shown as a gritty movie like its predecessors, turned out to be a genuinely fun and exciting movie filled with thrills and occasional spills. The cast had pretty good chemistry, characters interacted with one another very fluidly and pretty much everything made sense and fit together. Although the story was a bit predictable and at times stale, it made up with amazing fighting choreography and mind-blowing special effects. And the joker was legitimately one of the best jokers I have ever seen, even better than jack Nicholson's's portrayal.Overall recommend this movie to fans and casuals alike.",Suicide Squad
1758,brandonkiefer,"Way too many characters, too little development",3,10 August 2016,"Suicide Squad opens with a fast-paced sequence intended to cover a wide breadth of characters without going into any depth whatsoever. Oddly enough, this seems to be indicative of the movie as a whole: little depth of character among a large group of cast members. Following the introductory section where Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) introduces the future members of the ""Suicide Squad,"" we are quickly thrust into the main plot of the movie. One of the ""meta-humans,"" Enchantress (Cara Delevigne) begins a reign of terror upon Midway City. This action seems to be fine, but the sparse dialogue from Delevigne doesn't really give us a good reason as to why this is happening. Following this, the Suicide Squad comprised of Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), and a host of other baddies spring into action, along with their boss, Special Forces guru Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman). However, their mission doesn't focus on defeating the threat but instead rescuing an unidentifiable VIP from the city. What ensues is a menagerie of choppy editing, adequate action scenes, strange flashbacks, and a lack of character development. The problem with Suicide Squad is that the screen feels all too overcrowded at all points in time. At many points in the movie I found myself forgetting that some of the other ""villains"" even existed, such as Katana (Karen Fukuhara), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), and Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney). However, the writers did reserve some decent motivation and development for Deadshot and Harley Quinn who were brought to life by Smith and Robbie, respectively. They seem to be the only redeeming pieces of a film that possesses a sub-par script and plot. The biggest disappointment in terms of characters came from The Joker (Jared Leto). The trailers seemed to make The Joker out to be a major part of the plot, but he hardly spends 7 minutes on screen. Leto's portrayal doesn't fall that flat, but the over-inflated PR campaign that focused on his presence could only lead to disappointment. ""Suicide Squad"" desperately tried to capitalize on what made Guardians of the Galaxy so great, but their lack of character development leaves the audience wondering why they should care about the characters on screen. This, mixed with flat jokes and a villain so bad that we yearn for Ledger's Joker or even Bane, inevitably leaves the viewer disappointed.",Suicide Squad
1759,capspfifer,"While there were elements that I liked, I disliked the overall film.",5,7 August 2016,"In Suicide Squad, several DC bad guys are assembled by government agent Amanda Waller to fight other bad guys. People shoot guns, hit people with bats, explosions happen, and then the day is saved. My core complaint about this movie is that it's, for the most part, an action film that takes itself far too seriously. Keep in mind that this film includes: a crime boss in clown makeup, a human crocodile, and mushroom-head zombies created by an evil witch. Positives:Will Smith: the best performance in the film. As Deadshot, he's the sarcastic mercenary with a soft spot for his daughter. Had the whole film been like his performance (snarky yet playful with a few dramatic moments), I would have liked this film quite a bit. Bright Colors: Hooray! The two previous DC films seemed totally sapped of any visual cheer, and this film at least had a few neon visuals to contrast with the nighttime action scenes. The soundtrack: clearly aping off Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool, Suicide Squad employs a number of rock, pop, and rap songs throughout to add a sense of levity.Margot Robbie is an attractive lady (as many shots of the film make clear to the audience): I suppose Robbie did what she could with her performance as Harley Quinn, but it's difficult to step out of the shadows of Arleen Sorkin and Tara Strong. To me, the overall design (performance aside) came off as a mediocre stripper cosplay of an already sexualized character. And the Joker? Well, it's hard to judge considering how little time Jared Leto had on-screen.Others: Killer Croc growled out a couple of funny lines. Captain Boomerang (a bank robber with deadly weapons from down under) and Diablo (a Hispanic fire-bender) are neat characters. Negatives: Tone: Seriously, lighten up. You don't have to go full-on campy, but all comic books (no matter how serious) have some element of silliness that creators tend to embrace. Except for a few obvious reshoots, this film could have given Schindler's List a run for its money in terms of self-serious attitude. Villain: Before the Squad is assembled, there is no established villain beyond the vague threat that a superhuman could come and kill us all. There are scenes that establish The Enchantress and her brother (Incubus?), but there seems to be no concrete force for the Squad to fight until over half an hour into the film. Suicide Squad is a film that is mostly bogged down in its own sense of importance. Do I have a Marvel bias? Sure, but DC villains tend to be cooler than any heroes, so I had hopes for this film. Is there a conspiracy to hate this film? Maybe, but I guess the Secret Film Haters Society forgot to send me the memo. If you really want to see this film, don't let me stop you. But, I would personally say that you can skip this one.",Suicide Squad
1760,samuelbell-79744,amazing! go see it seriously!!,10,5 August 2016,"this movie was awesome to the extreme! ignore what the so called''critics'' have to say about this considering they thought Ghostbusters was a ''smash hit'', and clearly have some kind of backlash agenda. this movie has it all,non stop action packed scenes, sentimentality and quirky humour in all the right places. Letto delivers a fresh and innovative new take on the joker, Margot Robbie,and will smith are also stand outs.

1761,farhanparvez,Wastage of good potential!!!,2,7 September 2016,"Many were quite exited about this film, especially after the downfall of BvS. I fell in love with suicide squad instantly after seeing the first trailer. Who would'nt wanna see a gang of bad-ass super-villains pull off a big heist. Obviously it would have humor and more battles than BvS.Well its finally here and has kind of fallen apart. The action has no intensity, the heist feels tiny and the only thing bad about these super-bad villains is their acting. The characters wer'nt handled well. They had potential, but if only they were used properly. I ended up not really caring about the ones like Katana or Boomerang. I can say that Deadshot and Harley Quinn were good. Mostly cause they had most screen time and did good acting. But the battles felt useless as they had to fight a bunch of faceless zombies who don't really feel like a threat and the boss feels like its come from the Bollywood era. Now lets talk about the character i was most exited about: The Joker. Now of course no one would expect Jared Leto to be as good as Heath Ledger. But Leto still makes a fine charming joker. He actually did a good job. But here arises one of the biggest problems in the movie: The character is thoroughly wasted. Such a less screen time and he has no role or importance in the story.... AT ALL!! He was great but if they have done more of him, added a little complexity, that would have been great.Over all kind of a disappointment, but worth watching as it has a few great moments. In my opinion it was a little better than BvS.",Suicide Squad

He was barely anything.And killer croc.. well he wasn't killer croc. He was all gangsta! The plot was a disaster! Everything just fell apart! But then some aspects of this film were good. When Deadshot (Will Smith) jumped on the car and started shooting everybody.. that was an amazing scene!Then the action sequences were also pretty good. The ending, when everything was in Slo-Mo, that was a good part as well! There were just a LITTLE bit of laughables in this film. Just a little.

1766,quotangbro,I absolutely loved this Film.,10,2 August 2016,"I'm happy to say, Suicide Squad is a better film than Batman v Superman. Not only did it have balanced fun and seriousness (Unlike BvS), it also however made you tense in some scenes and they all were seriously well done. The action in the film was quite pleasing and though I was worried at first about the fight scenes, they were not disappointing and absolutely enjoyable. The only slight issue there is, is that Will Smith as Deadshot just felt like Will Smith playing Will Smith, and he didn't really build up to the character from the comics. Jared Leto's Joker was surprisingly well matched for the Film, and is easily my favorite movie Joker next to Heath. The Flash cameo was shocking to see, and it was a nice treat throughout the movie. Batman in this movie, was freaking scary just as the Director Said, and Ben Affleck as always, didn't disappoint his take on Batman in this movie. Overall I give this Movie a 10/10, Masterpiece. It was fun, sometimes brooding, action-packed, funny, and overall amazing. Suicide Squad was outstanding.",Suicide Squad
1767,samstokes-07988,"Not as bad as Wild, Wild West overall, CGI, story, and acting are though.",2,8 August 2016,"This movie is a waste of time, in bad way. Like Batman versus Superman, the CGi is dark and appears to be created using the least cost. Will Smith plays Deadpool better than let's say, James West in Wild, Wild, West, but doesn't earn his paycheck. Harley Quinn is like the psycho ex girlfriend in an abusive relationship who you would like to see do better, but will hit you with a bat. Overall the movie hardly reaches the fun that some of the Marvel Movies achieve. The CGI is about the same as what was used in Green Latern, not good, and the quality of the overall writing was about the same as Green Latern. If you like Batman versus Superman, then you will like this. Otherwise, wait and watch at home, the CGI might look better on your LED display than on the big screen.",Suicide Squad

Now the biggest question on most people's mind was, will jared leto live up to expectations? my response to that was YES! he wasn't trying to outdo, Jack or Heath he was a whole new joker, would love to of seen more of him throughout.

1769,domreppi,A lot of fun with above average acting,4,2 August 2016,"I won't lie, the movie isn't perfect. A few jokes fall flat, and make those moments awkward, but the rest is superb. The acting was more than I expected out of this movie. In terms of acting, I'll go in order of my top 3: Robbie, Leto, and Smith. All of their portrayals are excellent. El Diablo is a nice surprise, his character made us feel for him, maybe even more-so than the top stars. Leto knocks it out of the park. As a Ledger fanboy, I was dreading his performance, but his character was amazing down to the slightest movement. No amount of dialogue is wasted nor any simple movement is wasted. Overall, the movie was great, again, some awkward script, but the action scenes are done extremely well and the acting is great. 8/10. Leagues above Batman v Superman in my opinion.",Suicide Squad

Robbie and Letto seem to be the only interesting actors/characters and will almost guarantee a spin off based on their good chemistry. Will Smith as deadshot comes off as a nothing character who's angst is framed around a story line that we've all seen to many times.

1771,reelmoviefan,An all around good summer movie! Go see it!,8,6 August 2016,"I have been waiting a long time to see this, and I am glad that I finally saw the movie today. Was it worth the money, yes compared to other not so good flicks this summer, I won't mention any names.Now on to business then... Does this movie have a few problems? Sure it had a few issues, but what movie doesn't?The Bad: Some character introductions were not quite enough. Example: the Enchantress, a bit more intro/story needed. After the intros, the pacing was a bit off, choppy at times for the rest of the film. Seems the Editor was out to lunch, or the studio tied his hands. Some of the comedic one liners were not necessary at all, and a bit overdone. More action scenes with some of the lesser seen characters is needed, might have helped this movie quite a bit.The evil guys weren't evil enough, and there wasn't quite enough of the enemy to go around. We didn't really get any good backstory about the Big Bad, and where the Enchantress comes into it, and why they do what they do. I wont say any more about that, don't want to give anything away. And what's up with Slipknot? That is one character we didn't need.The Good: Margot Robbie shines as Harley Quinn in this film, and Will Smith's Deadshot is awesome as well. And Jay Hernandez as Diablo, totally Bad A$$! And Jared Leto's version of the Joker was Psychotically Off the Hook! Yes, although there are a lot of fans of Heath's Joker, and Jared does deliver a great performance IMHO, and I have seen all film incarnations of the Joker.Jai Courtney does a great job with Captain Boomerang! He had some funny moments in the film. Viola Davis, and Joel Kinnaman deliver solid performances as Amanda Waller and Rick Flag. I wouldn't want to be on the bad side of the Waller we see! She is more ruthless than the Suicide Squad. Most of the other minor characters did okay with the time allotted them.The music for this film was great, some older tunes, and newer a good mix. I also realize that this film is basically a setup for the characters for other movies that may or may not be happening. But I do hope to see more of Harley Quinn and the Joker, and Deadshot in future films. Who knows, maybe they can team up and take care of the Bat! LOLConclusion: Is it worth the time and money? Yes! Is it a solid 10 without fault? No! Is it a fun summer movie? Yes! Would I see it again? Yes! And it looks like Suicide Squad is kicking butt in the box office totals too! Don't believe me, go see Box Office Mojo!Side Note: And to all the paid critics out there, give it a rest already. Quit bashing the movie and acting like paid schills. Let people know your actual valid points of a film, whether good or bad, without your prejudices being involved. And let people form their own opinions about whether they should actually see the movie off solid intel.",Suicide Squad
1772,alexpedini,useless confusion,4,30 August 2016,"Think of a movie with the very trivial and silly plot, an annoying and chaotic editing and a film about superheroes without real superheroes and without a real villain ... you're thinking about suicide squad.Without dwelling too much on the technical and on the whole plot (which is ridiculous), I can not understand how it is possible that the presence of meta humans the squad is after all unnecessary accounts because in the few scenes in which collide against the bad (in most of the time roaming the streets deserted remembering endlessly to be ""Bad"") their presence is almost useless: in fact the army of enemies would not be able to hinder even a school of children of first grade. The end then really makes you think if everything this chaos was really needed ....",Suicide Squad
1773,pencilmein,Great movie for all comic book fans,10,3 August 2016,"This movie is just fun!! I don't care if you're a Marvel, DC, Vertigo, whatever fan, this movie is fast paced, funny and straight up enjoyable from start to finish. The problems BvS had was it was slow, tried to jam too much in and at times (as the viewer), you had no idea what direction it was trying to take. In contrast, Suicide Squad doesn't take itself too seriously and never feels like it's being dragged out at all. Margot Robbie and Jared Leto play the Clown Prince/Princess roles to utter perfection (however be warned, Leto's Joker is no Ledger's Joker, which is absolutely fine by me, he's redefined the role and made it his own). Will Smith is BACK WITH A BANG (pun intended). His take on Deadshot is exactly what I was hoping for, humorous but serious at the right times. Without revealing too much, Batman is excellent (and that's all I'll say). Lastly, Viola Davis is just plain evil as Amanda Waller and I loved her take on the iconic role. Would love her to return in the future. Overall, I'm giving this movie a perfect score because it's exactly what I hoped it would be - fun from start to finish.PS - don't let negative critic reviews sway your opinion on this movie. Negative reviews on BvS were justified. Negative reviews on this movie just seems straight up forced and uncalled for.",Suicide Squad
1774,u-14102,This is an AWESOME film,10,4 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a must watch film for all the comic book fans like me. It action-packed, funny and grips you in the whole time. 10/10. BEST FILM OF THIS YEAR. By the look of the trailer you just know how good it is. Deadshot. Enchantress. Killer Croc. Harley Quinn. Joker. Diablo. Amanda Waller. Captain Boomerang. Katana. OMG GUYS. Literally the best squad of all time. There are a few cheesy sayings like. "" So, we're some kind of Suicide Squad ? "". I MEAN YES. That's the name of your film. But other than that, it is just MMMMMMMMMMMM. This film blows the avengers out of this world. I mean come on. I actually ended up buying a joker suit at the end of the film. I only did that once and that was when I saw Batman V Superman. AWESOME FILM.",Suicide Squad
1775,uhsheen,"Great cast, terrible plot, mediocre action scenes and shoddy humor",2,4 August 2016,"I just got back from the movie and have a few feelings about it. It started out solid enough, we get to know the characters/motivations/weaknesses. Yes it was hurried but necessary and stylish.Then things drastically started to go downhill. DC's answer to Samuel Jackson is the stony faced Amanda Waller. She decides she needs to get these people together in case of another meta-human attack and by doing so she instigates the attack itself.So now we are faced with the big bad enchantress who we know nothing about and really aren't that committed to as a movie baddie. But that's OK... the bad guys aren't that important if our protagonists have good charisma with each other on screen. Here was my biggest issue. They just don't.The enemy ends up being a barrage of blackberry-headed minions and it begins to feel like an annoying video game. Step into a room, kill all bad guys, move on to the next room and repeat. To add insult to injury Rick Flagg even gets dragged away twice and has to be rescued like those ridiculous 'keep them alive' missions in video games. The action feels more suited to a war movie than to a comic book movie (perhaps the directors past is showing here)I wanted to like this movie, I wanted to like the characters but there were points where the dialogue was just so bad. TWICE, characters randomly hit on Katana to which she does not respond. It's not funny. TWICE everyone ends up ogling Harley Quinn. The attempts at humor in the movie were weak at best. Killer Croc utters so many pointless one liner's that are neither funny nor useful. It just didn't work. You want humor? When the characters are being shown their wildest dreams, give us a ridiculous seen with Boomerang. Give us some funny scenes with Diablo and stop saying 'esse' at him.I loved the romance with Joker and Harley.. give us more of that, don't squeeze the joker into a bunch of different personas.The bar scene was lovely, you felt the characters come close to something like a bond. Don't give us that at the end... give us that at the start of the movie, make us actually feel like these people mesh together well. They call themselves a family at the end but they have done nothing to merit that.Diablo had a cool scene at the end and Will Smith played an amazing Deadshot but I feel Rick Flag was just badly cast. I never really cared for the Rick and Deadshot scenes together on screen... It never felt like it really worked. Overall, I'll still watch DC movies, but I do feel like they are missing something that the Marvel counterpart has got right. Maybe it's heart, maybe Marvel just have more practice but I hope DC can redeem themselves next year.",Suicide Squad
1776,silvermick,They're the bad guys LOL,3,4 August 2016,"Disappointment. That's actually far better than what I felt after watching this movie. I wanted to leave the cinema about 30 minutes before the end but that's against my personal policy so I tried plan B but found nothing to poke my eyes out so I watched, and cried...-First, where is Deadshot? No, because all I saw from start to end is goody Will Smith playing the good family guy, very far from the cold hearted hired assassin he is supposed to play.-Second, what was that false publicity? The Joker appeared a lot in the trailer but he has absolutely no purpose in this movie apart from being the background story of Harley Quinn. Really, you remove him, you get the same movie but with only half of the theatre full.-Third, while I'm on her, the guys who made this movie obviously didn't get the relationship between Harley and the Joker. The Joker don't give a damn about her, she is his tool, he can throw her from a bridge without a second thought while Harley has developed a serious Stockholm Syndrome toward him. In this movie they are all lovey-dovey, at the end of the movie I nearly expected to see them leave in a car with ""Just Married"" written on the back with a ""And they lived happily ever after.""-The first half of the movie is actually not that bad, the villains really look and act like villains most of the time but everything started to fall apart after Will Smith reunite his troops after they failed the mission the first time, each one of them just want to drop everything and leave but then Will Smith says they can't give up and of course all the bad guys listen to him because he is Will Smith (God?). That was when I did my first face-palm.-This movie is 50% Will Smith, 40% Harley Quinn, and 10% the others. Really, apart from the first two, the others are just background characters, to make a comparison, in Guardian of the galaxy, you got one hero but you know the background stories of every members of the team, and they get their fair share of screen time. In this movie, they just don't care.-The jokes, sorry... The ""jokes"", well, I think the quotes speaks for themselves. Sometimes it's funny, most of the times it's not and sometimes they even try to explain the joke you understand but don't find funny. I think Warner tried to be more funny and less dark in this movie after they got some bad reviews about Batman Vs Superman being too dark but that's just ridiculous, they remade some scenes to add jokes and sometimes it even breaks the action.-And while I'm on it, Batman vs Superman had an impact in the DC Universe, it starts with the consequences of what happened in Man of Steel and at the end of it, the world has changed. In this movie, there is no progression of the DC Universe, it feels more like one of those filler episode you don't want to watch in any series.-I won't talk about the end of this movie because, as a sadist, I want you to go watch this movie and suffer during the two hours needed to finally reach the end credits. Just know that the last minutes are actually way worse than the rest of the movie. Enjoy ;)Anyway, as a DC fan, I wanted to see Harley Quinn in a movie but certainly not in this one. I really, really, REALLY hope that Warner won't use this movie as a reference to make Justice League because if they do I'll have to formulate an official request to DC so they can let Marvel do their movies :D See you all in 2017.",Suicide Squad
1777,goku-47083,If you are a DC fan you will like this movie,10,5 August 2016,"Don't always listen to what the ""critics"" say. This movie is good, this movie has great characters and great action. The main problem with it is the story which is all over he place and the plot is very simple. Also, the movie seems so dark but actually it's very light which was my main problem, also my only other problem was that there wasn't enough Joker.Will Smith did an amazing job, he didn't play Will Smith like he does in every other movie, he played cold hearted Deadshot. Margot of course is hot and played her perfect, she was written very well and there was only 1 cringe worthy joke at max. The others were cool but honestly most care about the big actors. The bad guy is OK, a little too much cgi and the person gets revealed pretty early, but the action that follows is good. Sometimes there are movies with action that makes you want to fight, sometimes there are movies where the story is so good your feel happy or cry. This movie makes you want to live in the dark world of DC, I want to be a superhero or super villain, I want to be half realistic while being half dark fantasy comic.

I am upset of the lack of the Joker which Jared Leto did good in the few scenes that he was in it, however, Harley Quinn was phenomenal! The movie does has a slow start but it somehow picks up. Movie isn't perfect cause it does has its flaws, but it'll get the job done while watching it. I will admit that it was overly hyped though cause it could have met the hype but it did not. Don't listen to the reviewers, be your own critic in this one... just go out with your squad and have fun! 7/10 my personal rate.",Suicide Squad
1779,taylagale,A really good movie!,9,6 August 2016,"Before I went out and watched this movie, I had heard A LOT of bad reviews - so I was fairly concerned about watching this movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised how the movie captivated me from the very beginning. Most people think that The Joker doesn't have enough screen time in the movie, which yes, he doesn't but in my opinion, I think he had just enough screen time to make all his scenes make sense - besides, he actually isn't a part of The Suicide Squad. I was also pretty worried that Harley Quinn's character would be made into some type of sex symbol that over shadowed her character, but once again, I was pleasantly surprised that they kept her sex symbol status to a minimum and let her character flourish. Every scene in this movie makes sense and all links together. There's not ""too much"" happening as it all links to the overall story line. This movie is very similar to the anime version as well, so if you want an idea of how the movie is going to go - give that a watch. I really enjoyed this movie and would happily watch it again.",Suicide Squad

But let me be very frank in India everyone loved it..people have played their characters to the point especially Margot robbie..you could connect with her story ...a bit more of joker would have been nice with more on the backstory of quinn n joker but u cant have it all..all in all its a fun movie..people have jumped on the bandwagon to trash it.. if this was so bad then civil war also is tasteless given so stretched plot with no actual end...everyone lives and goes their way..could have done that at the start of the movie..but again not criticising..there is no point comparing it to any movie..each movie is different unless its a reboot or remake..end note don't hate it just enjoy it.Not so bad..its fun,Suicide Squad

Given that the cardboard measures 40 cm on a side, find the dimensions of the box that will give the maximum volume. What is the maximum volume? V= l(w)(h). Let volume be a function of h or V(h)=(40-2h)(40-2h)h. Take the derivative of the function and set it equal to 0: V'(h)=0 and solve for h which will be a relative minimum or maximum point. Suicide Squad looks fun. I've seen the movie with Will Smith where he's the only normal person in Manhattan who finds a cure. He befriends a woman who takes the cure to an outpost. Margot Robbie, in The Legend of Tarzan, is great with Will in fighting for a law enforcement agency.Quinn's gun with the 2 words Love and Hate written on the chamber.

You are going to have flashbacks. But in no way were they too drawn out, lost or unneeded. I have no idea what people were talking about. There was an appropriate amount of backstory, an excellent cgi team, and an excellent script. And the joker got a decent amount of screen time and hailed back to Jack Nicholsons joker. Everything was in its proper place. And the enchantress...Omg! If you did not like that...there's no hope for you. I'd suggest you stop watching comic movies. One word of advice. Do not pee. You'll be lost. Might as well not even walk back in. Wear depends if you have to. This movie is done they way it should have been done. If you are expecting a movie like Grapes of Wrath, or Jane Austen shame on you. The writers, directors, and yes the acting was great. I'm not a hardcore comic fan, but even if I were, I'd be proud of this movie. It did the SUICIDE SQUAD justice. Please keep in mind the name of the movie.

I went in for the characters and GOD THEY WERE REAL. I wanted more Joker. But we will get a movie whit him. The rest of the cast just awesome. I did not know the character Diablo before this movie and I did not know about the actor that played him and yet it was one of the best characters in comic-movies .They made me care for them. And we got awesome villains for the future something that Marvel right now fails to do . So DC keep it bad and fight the evil . I went as a comic lover and I am happy. I believe people set the bar For Dc allot higher that they set it for Marvel and every time is not that high people go crazy . Like one of the best characters will say it.

Because it has just what you REALISTICALY expect it to have: bad guys vs good buys. Of course the twist here is that the good guys are bad guys too. It's a fight between the good and the bad, just as it is in every superhero movie. Get a hold of yourself and appreciate the characters, which are brought to live by extraordinary actors. Appreciate the great music, the costumes, the CGI, and even the script which was written in 6 weeks. 6 WEEKS! Sure, it has some stuff that could've been better, but it's understandable. My only problem with the movie is that they've cut scenes with Harley and Joker, who i'm sure that if they left it, the movie would've been much better. Love the characters, the actors, the movie, the plot. They did what they could, and they know where they could've made more. Imagine the stress they work in, the rejections they get, and understand.

From there it's somewhat of a mixture of stop and go when it comes to action and plot. A lot of DC fan service and another notch cutting deeper into the DCEU (DC Extended Universe). First off, Will Smith's Deadshot was pretty awesome, I had my doubts at first. Margot Robbie as and Jai Courtney delivered as Harley Quinn and Captain Boomerang, the rest of the squad ""served their purpose"" as far as plot goes. Jared Leto channeled a lot of different portrayals of the Joker, from the Jester to the Gangster and the a little splash of Anarchist, definitely looking forward for more of that!Cara Delevingne's portrayal as Enchantress delivered as an overarching threat and made the stakes of the story believable. Two very well executed Justice League cameos served up as a little hype and anticipation to what Justice League will dish up in 2017. The post credit scene will give DC Fans some more hype to enjoy.Definitely would like to see if they release a Director's Cut and see what the other version of the film looked like.‪#‎SuicideSquad2016‬ ‪#‎JanSuperheroMovieReviews‬",Suicide Squad
1786,kosovojeesrbija,I love it. I Haven't watched a better movie in years. Its doesn't deserve the hate,10,9 August 2016,"I really enjoyed every bit of this movie, not one scene did i find boring. I haven't watched something this good in years. I love the story line. Almost Everything is perfect about this movie. And ""most"" people who think its bad is because they are reading what critics are saying.they are saying its a basic plot it definitely is not they are so many surprises,.. From the reviews i was reading Going into this movie i thought it was going to be horrible and one of the worst movies ever i came out surprised. The joker is in my opinion the best character in the movie his role only lasts 15 minutes but its enough. I was amazed by him. Harley Quinn was amazing they captured her very well. Deadshot was great too i actually didn't like him from the trailers but after watching the movie i love him. The movie made me like all the characters. I like them so much that now I'm collecting their toys. Another reason why this movie is good is because you've got a little bit of everything Action, Comedy, Sadness, Drama. I hope they will be making a second part very soon. But There is one problem about this movie. that is Picking Cara Delevingne as the role was a huge mistake. Her acting was horrible everything was horrible about her that is the only flaw in the movie. Before this i never liked villain and superhero movies i was never even a fan of dc. But after watching suicide squad i definitely am. I love it! And to anyone thinking of not watching the movie because of what critics are saying are making a huge mistake the movie is amazing and i am sure you will like it.

1787,stevenmmcdonough,Actually a very good comic book movie !,8,9 August 2016,I have recently seen Suicide Squad in 3 -D and I'm not sure why all the critics panned it so mercilessly. My sense is there was no character development but there was enough to get why these bad guys were in prison. Also the movie had plenty of plot development to go two hours and when the antiheroes seemed to be completely beaten they rose up to complete their mission to save the day.My only other exposure to Suicide Squad villains was a DC Universe movie called Batman Assault on Arkham. Some different characters in that made me understand the Batman and bad guy connection.This movie shouldn't be any kind of disappointment to an average comic book fan of live action.Root for the bad guys!,Suicide Squad

This was some of the worst movies I have ever saw really. I was most annoyed because they tried to make some poor comedy between actions scenes.

Robbie is tremendous as a broken woman that found someone to love her edges. Leto is absolutely stellar at making the Joker the most likable evil villain I have ever seen on screen.

1790,luciojuniorlj,"A Fun movie, tortured by the hands of critics",8,25 September 2016,"This contains spoilers, you have been warned...Unbelievable. ""My pet just died, my car broke down, my relatives died, my boss fired me. I'm going to go see Suicide Squad with my ears plugged and review it right afterwards"" that must've been what the critics were experiencing. What was supposed to be a Fun and Hilarious movie, was destroyed by critics.I'm pretty sure it's something in the air, because this is just ridiculous. I went to the cinema with my good friend, as it started my mind was telling me: Don't expect Perfection and Flawless' child. The loaf scene already had me smiling. The way the movie was going I could already tell it was supposed to be a fun movie.Amanda Waller's performance was stunning, the actress fit the role like a puzzle piece. She looked very manipulative, someone who always got what she wanted one way or another.Deadshot, what I thought was going to be a terrible idea, turned out to be the funniest. Will Smith's acting was incredible as Deadshot, I've never pictured Floyd Lawton to be a joker and I was impressed. One scene in particular had me going, with my jaw sweeping the floor. That was his Cut and Run moment, when he had enough and started ""raining bullets on the minion's heads"" The way it synchronized with the music was incredible and I could watch it everyday for the rest of my life.Harley Quinn stole the show, you could tel, this was her movie by the way she acted. Funny, dangerous was her personality and M. Robbie nailed the role.The Joker, he was just incredible. I saw him and thought ""Yes! This is my kind of Joker"". A crime boss who enjoys suffering, committing crimes and such. Ledger was a legend but I prefer Jared Leto just a bit more, honestly, I wanted the same tattoo he had on his left hand, so every time I looked at it or laughed I'd remember this Awesome movie. The acid tank scene was out of nowhere but was incredible, it gives us an understanding that Joker cares about her as much as she cares about him. I need that song on my mobile phone.Enchantress was SPOILER the main villain in this movie, that is something most of us didn't expect, but just because we don't know EVERYTHING about her, doesn't mean you won't enjoy the movie any less. ""Oh god, she's the villain. HATE THIS, I'M OUT OF HERE"" I guarantee you no one in this planet did that and if it did, then this person is a sexist or somethingThe others like El Diablo, Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc were interesting characters as well, especially Chato Santana and his backstory.Critics say this movie has a horrible plot and has choppy editing but do NOT listen to them, while there are some scenes that didn't make it in the final cut, things like SPOILER Joker being abusive towards Harley, him showing up in the finale and such, we'll get to see them when the Blu Ray comes out. But that's only noticeable IF and only IF you're looking for choppy scenes.Horrible plot is greatly exaggerated, Introducing Task Force X, a little of their backstory, a MetaHuman shows up and reeks havoc, making the government assemble the team to take down this unbeatable monster. Sure it doesn't sound proper but honestly you won't even notice anything out of place in it when you watch it. You'll be too busy laughing at the insane level of comedy and dialogue. Many things happen between all of that, I said 4 of the dozens of things that happen in this film. Do not listen to the critics.To end this review, I say Suicide Squad lightens the mood with Task Force YES David Ayer has done a good job, I watched it twice, my friends went there three times and never got bored Suicide Squad I give it a 8/10",Suicide Squad
1791,featherstondraws,A satisfying popcorn film with several strong performances,8,25 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is campy and fun, with a surprising amount of heart. 8/10 for general audiences, 9/10 for fans.Praise:We already knew that the film would be visually appealing. What I didn't expect was that David Ayer would be able to take nine new characters with decades of history and successfully make us care about them. Their disparate motivations make the conflict between characters genuine,and not the standard ""two superheroes meet and must automatically fight,"" so when they do come together as a team it feels earned.-The action scenes against the Lovecraftian hordes of corrupted citizens are brutal, high-energy, and satisfying spectacles in which every team member shines.-The Boomerang/ Slipknot scene is lifted straight from the classic comics, with one sick twist-Viola Davis plays Amanda Waller with perfect gravitas.Margot Robbie's version of Harley Quinn is a near-perfect portrayal of a performance artist drawing attention to cover her pain. Not all her jokes land, but she's a worthy addition to the character's history.-Will Smith's Deadshot is probably the most sympathetic version of the character to date. He takes a fairly clichéd backstory and makes us care.We get to see Batman on the hunt in Gotham, and in his limited screen time Affleck proves once again that he's the most comic-accurate Batman to date.Complaints:-The pacing of the main story is a little weird. After a creepy and effective introduction, the villains of the piece camp out in the third act of a Ghostbusters movie and more or less wait for our heroes to catch up. The ""big bad"" isn't really the point of the film, but it would have been nice to give them more to do.-For all the reports of Jared Leto's method acting, he fails to embody the Joker. He does not instill fear, nor perform with enough panache to make us cheer for him.-Katana was amazing, and I would have loved to see more of her story. We don't really get to know her.",Suicide Squad
1792,jessikazofia,"It's cool, but what happened?",4,30 August 2016,"I am a huge DC fan, and was eager to see the film when I first caught wind that 'Suicide Squad' was in the making. Though having many expectations, hopes, etc, I walked into the theater with a blank slate - I wanted to judge this film based on the film alone, without comparison to any other sources. The film has a quality soundtrack, and Will Smith and Margot Robbie's characters fill the screen with their amazing acting and portrayals of these quirky villains, and though slightly overused, the kaleidoscope effect in the end credits was pretty cool... But I think most of the film's budget went into that rather than the post-production editing team's paycheck. The editing was okay, but it muddled up the time lapse within the film. Though ""3 days"" had passed, it had felt as though the whole film had happened within a single night. It was messy, and the CGI with Cara Delevigne's character felt a little mediocre. Suicide Squad had potential, and if the producer(s) had made their minds up rather than creating two 'separate' films and awkwardly combining them both together, it could have truly been a great film. The pomp and flash of the design and humor caters to a wider audience, and it's no secret why Suicide Squad is doing so well financially. But the truth is, though it has some great characters and awesome music, it's not well edited and it's not a brilliant film. It tried to bring in the humor and kick of Deadpool with the whimsicality of Guardians of the Galaxy, and I feel that if DC tried to be DC, and stopped trying to compete and out-do Marvel, it could produce something truly spectacular. We've seen the Dark Knight, we know what DC can do, it's about time it brought that flare back and created something truly spectacular.",Suicide Squad
1793,cjhunter-67792,"A great movie, put poor marketing can compromise experience and quality.",7,14 September 2016,"I really enjoyed this film, although my opinion is coming with no background in DC Comics, so I didn't really have anything to compare it to. What I did have a problem with however, is all the cuts that had been made to the film. There were a crap ton of scenes cut out, which both Jared Leto and Margot Robbie have made comments about.There wasn't even a back story for Killer Croc. I do believe that DC is likely going to come out this (2016) Christmas with a Directors Cut. People who thoroughly enjoyed the movie would of purchased it as soon as it was released on DVD, and then if a directors Cut came out, they'd buy it again. This way they make twice the money. Doing so it compromised the quality of the movie in the theatrical version.",Suicide Squad
1794,ksp-58491,"Oh, Well...",8,22 November 2016,"To each his own. There are a lot of negative reviews about this movie, but I actually liked it. Everyone has his tastes in movies: a lot of people liked Jurassic World, which I found to be as boring and predictable as people say Suicide Squad is.This movie really wasn't as bad as all that, but if you like flying space stations and Yodas, this movie probably won't be for you. There isn't a lot of action, and there are times when it slows, but for me, it was far from boring.The action scenes it DOES have weren't really explosive, but they fit in pretty well where they were. They weren't overly-done as you would see in, say, Furious 7. Still, I found it pretty exciting. I'm more a horror movie fan, but decided to watch this, as there are currently no really good horrors out now and I WAS pleasantly surprised. It was well cast-- Margot Robbie and Jared Leto were excellent in their roles as Harley Quinn and Joker.I'm not trying to sway anyone in favor of Suicide Squad; like I said, to each his own. I simply wrote this to express my own opinion about this movie. I liked it, case closed. If you didn't, that's your right.",Suicide Squad
1795,moptimusbrime,This movie truly made me want to commit suicide,2,20 October 2016,"I think we should just talk about the common praise for this movie and talk about why it's completely unjust (In my opinion of course). 1. The characters are really fun though! Around three of the characters are shown to have any character whatsoever, while everyone else is essentially a one dimensional prop. Will Smith never actually created a character and instead just played himself, Margot Robbie played a walking punchline dispenser only none of the jokes were actually funny and Jared Leto is easily the worst Joker ever put to any medium including fan fiction, everyone else either had no character or served little point to the movie. 2. The Action was so cool! If you think shooting putty monsters is cool then be my guest 3. But it was just so much fun More like there were a few witty lines here and there, the only good parts of the movie was the stuff with Harley Quinn and The Joker because it was so hilariously awful, everything else was a complete bore of mismatched music, useless characters,muddled scenes, scenes that go on way too long, scenes that feel like they repeat themselves not to mention a terrible villain who didn't feel like a threat whatsoever but aside from all those 'nitpicks' I guess the movie was fun, wasn't it. Also please don't rate movies that haven't come out in theaters yet and especially don't go around trying to ban rotten tomatoes because critics didn't like the movie, that's like going around trying to sue the dictionary. 2/10",Suicide Squad
1796,TheCriticallyAcclaimed,"As an avid reader, I loved it",9,24 October 2016,"The minute I heard about it's production state I immediately vowed myself to watching it in theaters. If you're a huge fan of the DC universe you will love the way these characters come to life on the big screen. While talk about how the movie was ""quickly put together"" does become visible in some scenes, it still does not take away from the fact that this is a nice new way of shooting DC films, especially with iconic villains in it and for future standalone movies with other DCEU villains or heroes for that matter.David Ayer did a really good job on allowing the actors to connect to one another behind the scenes in order to show genuine chemistry which I believe truly pays off if you consider how the villains interact with one another in the comic books. The chemistry does not feel forced. Like stated before, if you are a fan of the comics, you will enjoy the way these characters interact with one another.While I do agree that Will Smith's portrayal of Deadshot was missing something, it still does not make the bond between him and Harley any less significant. Also, Margot Robbie was definitely a kick ass part of this team. She truly embodied the attitude, charisma, and athleticism of Harley Quinn that we all know and love. The cameos were great and I hope to see future spin offs from certain characters such as Kitana, Deadshot, and of course the Joker.Now to the big cheese. Jared Leto's Joker is truly a nice take for the world Suicide Squad is set in. It makes sense that a maniacal crime boss would splurge on the outfits and cars seen in the movie. The only significant problem I had was his lack of screen time. I also think they could have shown more about how Harley and Joker's relationship was turbulent. Hopefully, with the director's cut, we will see in full form what Ayer originally had in mind.I only gave this such a generous rating because I really did love the movie. I did allow myself to walk in with a sort of non-bias mindset to see it from both a positive and negative prospective but I honestly could not contain myself from cheering to myself once the intro song rang throughout the theater. One problem I have with some of the critics' reviews is that I feel as though they walked in with the expectation of a Marvel movie in mind. It was definitely worth the watch in theaters and I will definitely buy the director's cut when it comes out.",Suicide Squad

1798,p-51243,A movie that deserved straight to DVD....,5,5 November 2016,"This movie was all over the place. I was expecting a lot more from David Ayer, since he has brought us amazing movies like Training Day, Fury, and End of Watch. But holy hell this was terrible I hope for his sake that this movie was so bad because of the studio interfering... The movie trailers had more of the joker in it than the movie did.. With and all star cast like this Ayer really under utilized half of the cast. The main focus was on Will Smith's character ""Deadshot"" who wanted to do right by his daughter and Margot Robbie's character ""Harley Quinn"" who had this Romeo & Juliet relationship with Jared Leto's ""Joker"" character. There were parts that this movie hit right on the head then others that were so far off of the comics you couldn't even appreciate the movie anymore.. This movie has a terrible time keeping you interested in the film the plot is just another basic Superhero movie you don't even feel like the suicide squad are bad guys.. This movie should have been made more rated R instead of right on the verge of PG...",Suicide Squad
1799,cullenmhobbs,Great acting with some funny jokes and good characters even if a bit of a mess,6,28 November 2016,Suicide Squad was definitely a really fun movie! With some cool scenes and an outrageous cast!Pros. Will Smith did a great job in this movie. I knew he was gonna be good from the very beginning and he did not disappoint! He really brought that Will Smith charisma with him. And it turned out fantastic! Props to one of my favorite actors! Margot Robbie also did fantastic in the movie! She kicked so much butt! They also really get you to care about her character (like most of the other characters in this movie) And she did a great job! She must have gone into method acting because she was insane! Viola Davis as Amanda Waller........... MIND BLOWN! She did an outstanding job in this movie! Her script said she meant business and her acting showed it! And now lets talk about........ JARED LETO'S JOKER!!!!!!! To be honest even though we didn't get that much of him what we got of him was fantastic! Now I wouldn't say he's better than Heath Ledger's Joker. But I can see them both going into method acting! And they both did. The Action was also pretty cool in this movie! It was really awesome! There was this one scene where Deadshot (Will Smith's character) was shooting up an army of rock monsters and it was awesome! And I love how they got you to care about the characters before they sent them on a mission! I do feel like they could've spent more time on some of the characters that weren't Harley Quinn and Deadshot but I still liked the beginning! Cons. Now even though I said this movie was really fun its also a bit messy Now the movie has some great action sequences. But those action sequences.... BUT THOSE ACTION SEQUENCES ARE IN BETWEEN A BUNCH OF WALKING AND TALKING AND I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH WALKING AND TALKING IN MOVIES BUT IN THIS MOVIE IT GOT REALLY REPETITIVE CAUSE THIS HAD WAY TOO MUCH OF IT!!! Heres kind of the layout of this movie. 1st act: Characters being developed. 2nd act: Action and walking from point A to point B. 3rd act. Final battle. And the movie is really messy! Also Slipknot was terrible! He had so little screen time and so little lines that I can't even comment on Adam Beaches acting! I also hated Killer Croc. Now even though his makeup looks good he's a terrible character! He's just a big giant pun! He has some funny jokes in there but over all he didn't have much meaning to him! And that's sad cause he was one of my most anticipated characters to see in the movie! The villain was also really weak! I'm not gonna tell you the villain though cause that's kind of a spoiler but the villain is terrible! The rest of the characters are just meh (Those characters are Rick Flagg and Katana) So overall Suicide Squad is a fun movie with great characters fun charisma funny jokes and good action! Even if a weak villain and a messy plot! I will give Suicide Squad a C+,Suicide Squad
1800,jaiswalhirdesh,Why not?,10,4 December 2016,Why did the movie have to be panned so bad? I have seen worse movies like captain America which was even worse. This movie was way better. Sure there were predictable and some corny moments but overall wasn't it good entertainment?Fans of the genre need to accept that there will be different movies and I generally want DC movies to be dark and menacing and not sugary like avengers. The acting was above par and Margot Robbie stole the show with her cuteness and depth of acting (remember when she gets sentimental) along with Jared creating a new stylish Joker who is pretty close the coming book joker. Seriously we need movies like this where stuff is real and the characters struggle with themselves rather than born righteous like the marvel universe,Suicide Squad
1801,michelletigers,Very entertaining guilty pleasure,9,19 December 2016,"The point lost is because of an excessive and poorly chosen music soundtrack which was as distracting as an A list actor with a coke problem. The best example of this is the scene where the Suicide Squad members have been unshackled and are standing in a circle surrounding and given their personal items inside their trunks. Because of the great characters and dialogue, snappy comebacks and the transitional period this scene should have relied on those conversations and music should not have interfered. But the music supervisor decided to bath all over it with The White Stripes (as a fan they truly deserve better placement) and it was overwhelming, stressful and felt forced. Bad job music supervisor, you kind of ruined it for me... or rather, you did. Even in the movie trailer they let this scene go without music! Anyhow, the movie aside from the excessive music forced on the audience, was a blast the first and second time I watched it.",Suicide Squad
1802,prathams-23396,could this be any better,9,1 January 2017,"suicide squad is one of the most best movie of dc comics, it may not be as good the dark knight but still it is pretty amazing. margot Robbie the best part of the movie. i loved everyone in this movie joker is back again and this time with a bang. i loved this movie and so would you. i reduced one point for the villain. the name of the villain is enchantress and she may not be good as other people even though the actor is capable to do such roles but still the villain doesn't create that much a spark in our heads. i loved this movie with all my heart. after giving such a disaster movie like dawn of justice, suicide squad gives hope to the dc fans.",Suicide Squad
1803,bananacupcake-09293,Needs more action,4,12 January 2017,"I saw Suicide Squad about a week ago and it had its ups and downs. I like how it takes a different turn from the cliché superhero movie. Instead of having some guy/girl that is an ordinary human by day, but at night they are a crime fighting superhero. They have the government take villains out of jail, to do the job of a superhero. It is a very interesting take on it. I also really like about the acting in the movie; it was excellent. Margot Robbie (played Harley Quinn) did a really good job playing the role; she made me really believe that she was actually insane. Then, Jared Leto (played the Joker) made a really good Joker. He wasn't the best Joker of all time, but he is a close second, in my opinion. Some of the parts of the movie i didn't like was that how it took one hour to get into the action of the movie. The whole first part of the movie was an introduction of who the people are. Which I know is important, but they could at least put some little action in the introduction at least. I wouldn't of interest that quick if they put more action in it. Then the action in the movie was over so quick. It was over in a blink of an eye. I just wish they would of made the action part longer and the introduction part shorter. The end of movie felt very rush. It was really short and the ending too predictable. I won't talk much about the ending so I won't spoil it.Lastly, they made a big deal that the Joker was going to have a big part in the movie, but he didn't. Yes he had more bigger parts then others, but he was only in the movie tops 30 minutes. I wish he was in the movie more because I loved his character so much, he was actually my favorite character in the movie.",Suicide Squad
1804,kerton_rail,Worth the watch,7,6 April 2017,"Not a massive DC comic guy but this was decent for something that I'm not normally really into, despite it's mixed bag reviews I found it good and very watchable, Will Smith was quality throughout and played his role as Deadshot to perfection loved his performance, I can understand why people left concerns about the Role Joker played which is very self-explanatory but the side story in the movie about him and Harley Quinn and how they met didn't mix in well with the film. but other than that I thought the bad reviews left were harsh as it was enjoyable.",Suicide Squad
1805,michaelmcmillan-87407,Better than I thought,8,4 March 2017,"While it had the very typical super hero plot line, Suicide Squad looked at the villain side and made it quite appealing. By looking into the humanity of these villains, viewers get to see a different side of this ""super hero"" story. Will smith is the strongest character and plays the dark dead shot with perfection. By him playing off the other strong characters, such as Harley Quinn and Diablo, there is a strong sense of commodity between these so called villains.",Suicide Squad
1806,shpy-49243,A cash grab at it's worst,1,22 April 2017,"Let me start by saying that Suicide Squad is the worst comic book movie in existence. Poor writing, improper acting, flat and stupid jokes render this movie as nothing more than a silly cash grab . Spoilers ahead. Let us start with the plot. First we get an hour of improperly placed flashbacks which are absolutely of no use to the plot. After the introduction of Squad members we get an hour of Suicide Squad meets the Walking dead, with brainless action of Squad members facing weird goons. The movie focuses so much on Deadshot and Harley that it could be called Deadshot, Harley and some others. I say 'some others' as the movie treats all other squad members except El Diablo as red shirts who serve no purpose other than making crony statements. Other squad members could very well be replaced by common soldiers and it would make no difference to the plot. Diablo is perhaps the only member who has any importance in moving the plot forward but he gets very little screen time to make his character interesting. His entire arc is as follows. Gets forced to go on mission, then gets forced into helping the team. Finally after a stupid, SHORT and crony conversation at a bar the guys he met only a few hours ago and wasn't helping when their lives were in danger become his FAMILY. He then transforms into an entity we have no information about to fight an entity we have no information about and dies. The movie also suffers with terrible fight choreography and cinematography. Who the hell thought that it was a good idea to make the belly dancer who can kill every squad members in an instant fight the squad members in blue fog. And please note that these people supposed to be BAD GUYZ and we don't see anything that proves that. In fact after they run away from the mission after their neck bombs are disarmed they return to help Rick Flag save his belly dancer girlfriend.The big bad is the spirit of a centuries old belly dancing witch who is powerful enough to destroy the world and has possessed an extremely unprofessional archaeologist. Her only weakness is her heart. And both her heart and her were left without being monitored by the head of USA's covert organization named Argus.",Suicide Squad

1811,bramblebark,Complete Disaster,1,30 October 2017,"Suicide Squad might be the worst movie I've ever seen, I've watched countless bad movies, anything from The Room to the Neil Breen collection. But Suicide Squad is so far away from the ""so bad it's good"" genre that it actually becomes borderline embarrassing, and I don't even want to imagine what it was like to watch this in a cinema. I think my main issue with Suicide Squad is something that Marvel has tried to tackle a lot lately with its cinematic universe, and it's these weird, unfunny one-liners that just seem to appear out of nowhere, they don't fit with the current mood of the scene at all, and if you're over the age of 15 then these most likely just make you uncomfortable. Suicide Squad is just riddled with these dreadful little jokes and comments from the characters. The relationship between Harley Quinn and The Joker is a complete disaster. instead of going with the actual case that Harley Quinn is a victim of Stockholm syndrome, they are now just two uninteresting maniacs that are in love, news flash; THIS HAS BEEN DONE SO MANY TIMES BEFORE BUT WITH BETTER WRITERS. A lot of people are saying that Diablo is the best character in the movie, but I completely disagree, Diablo in this movie is what I like to call a ""nothing-character"" Characters like Darth Maul who say and do cool stuff, but the writing is so absurd that they ultimately become uninteresting and forgettable. Why does Killer Croc look like an out of shape wrestler?In conclusion this movie is just an embarrassing disaster, and the absolute worst of the DC cinematic universe.",Suicide Squad
1812,gbilleorge,Just nothing that the trailer promised,3,11 August 2017,"Honestly, just a huge let down in general compared to what was hyped up in the trailers. The whole second half was just filled with plot holes and terrible writing. Random no body characters popping in and out to extended the amount of content but in terms of quality story telling, it just didn't make sense. This is the universe with heroes like Superman and Batman, and you're going to send a group of criminals in with no team-training or plan to just save the world? Why not start smaller? At least Marvel (yes I'm comparing the two) builds up the franchise slowly, character by character, with problems that are within the scope of the heroes ability to fix. A girl with a baseball bat, a marksman, a crocodile, a samurai (who I really had no feelings for whatsoever) and the flame guy from fantastic 4, had no reason to defeat the final boss who had ridiculous powers.

Deadshot was actually caring, and his actions are motivated by his desire to help is daughter. Most of the characters weren't that bad, although the boomerang guy wasn't that important or likable. Anyways, the plot is just the stereotypical action movie plot, but the action and magic is still fun to watch.

Sad in that many of the actors in this movie did what the could with their part, but the center does not hold, it crashes.",Suicide Squad
1838,christihazlett,Watch the extended cut,7,10 December 2019,"I kinda sorta liked this movie, but I do prefer the Marvel universe better.
This is a bad movie you can't help but like from start to finish. Then, the extended cut was on and I decided, what the heck, and ordered it. Most, if not all that was put back in the extended cut, really helped with the over all storyline. It still didn't boost it to the Marvel universe level, but it did make for a better movie.
I'm not really reviewing the movie, but just putting out there to watch the extended cut and give the movie another shot. DC still has a long way to go in the comic book movie arena, and if they don't step up their movie performance, they just aren't going to do it.",Suicide Squad

The major downfall for me is Will Smith, and making the movie all about him. I'm surprised it wasn't called Deadshot and the gang or something. I think if they dropped Idris Elba in to replace Smith, or even keep him as Bloodsport and take Deadshot out, and add King Shark but voiced by Ron Funches from the animated Harley series. And it would be even better.",Suicide Squad

1843,breanne-98198,Had so much potential,5,9 February 2020,"This movie had alot going for it, new and bold characters, a refreshingly different take on the usual superhero movies, and a phenomenal soundtrack. But the rest was sloppy and disappointing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed watching it, even went to see it a second time in theaters, but this didn't overshadow the poor forethought of how they presented the movie.First of all, this was a Will Smith movie. Plain and simple. He was the biggest name in the cast and got an incredible amount of screentime which could have been better spent evening out the other characters.Secondly, the characters were extremely unevenly distributed. They spent significant amounts of time discussing the backstories for Will Smith and Margot Robbie's characters but only a few minutes on the other characters who should have been equally important. Then a few other characters only got literal seconds worth of an intro, even though a couple of these characters were present throughout the rest of the film. This made them feel awkwardly placed compared to others who had been very thoroughly introduced.And finally, the people in charge of this film couldn't seem to decide if they were making a backstory movie for Harley Quinn and the Joker or if they were making a Suicide Squad film. Even though they ended up cutting the majority of Joker's scenes, the film had enough background there to beg the questions- why didn't they do a full film on these two, and if the hidden focus of this film was supposed to be the relationship between the Joker and Harley Quinn, then why was Deadshot given so much attention on his own too?Overall, the sloppy distribution of time spent on the different characters didn't seem to have been given much thought and resulted in a film that was enjoyable to watch but didn't hold up to what it could have been.",Suicide Squad
1844,imtheonemlg,GOD-TEAR MOVIE,10,25 February 2020,"I feel like this movie was hated too much. It got mainly 1-4 stars when people reviewed it and I feel that was a little harsh. The cast was mostly great, i would say the stand outs were Jared Leto and Margo Robbie but everyone else was good too. the cameos were almost something ripped out of a comic book. I feel people are hypocrites for hating how the flash cameo-ed when things like that happen ALL THE TIME in the comics. Jared Leto was underused. In conclusion this movie is great and you guys are mean.",Suicide Squad
1845,howeben,Okay so the plot wasn't there but it introduced some really great characters.,7,5 April 2021,"The plot seemed undeveloped and not very well thought out however the plot wasn't really the point of the movie. We had some of the funniest comic book characters introduced in these scenes. Boomerang acts as hilarious comic relief throughout, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a perfect casting choice who has some of the funniest one-liners in a comic book movie ever. And Will Smith as Deadshot again just works seamlessly. His character also has serious depth due to the relationship between him and his daughter.What people fail to understand is that this movie is not about the plot, it takes a backseat to the characters and the question ""are these criminals redeemable"" and the answer to that is almost a definite no. Most of them are dreadful people but that does not stop me laughing throughout.Personally I don't think this movie deserves the hate it gets however I do completely understand how people think the plot of this movie is a let-down, hope to see a better story in The Suicide Squad 2021.",Suicide Squad

After a nice opening introducing with a very special Queen's song and interesting cut scenes, they barely failed with presenting a non-sense movie story. It's look like that the Villains become friends and good people and want to ""save"" the world, losing that aspect that they are murders, psychopath, thief and etc...
They could explore better the darkside of the government, the Joker as a Villian and the intelligence of the characters.

The characters got short introductions. Some would say too short but I thought it was just right. Margot Robbie's Harley is funny (and hot!) And Jai Courtney makes a very cool Captain Boomerang. Will Smith acts well but could have taken things a little less serious and a bit more comedy. But when the real 'story' got going, it became just another superhero movie. The villain seeks nothing less than world domination, has an army of followers (who looked really stupid and reminded me of '90s Power Ranger opponents). Worst of all, there's a great beam in the sky where the villain's weapon is charging up. AGAIN! Why?! Has Hollywood declared it mandatory in a superhero flick? It has been done sooo many times it really annoyed me.Anyway, the fun ended. In multiple scenes we're shown that the squad, who are labeled as bad guys, have a bit of heroism in them. Will Smith tries to be serious (succeeds) and Jay Hernandez tries to be emotional (fails).I guess I was hoping for another Deadpool but got another BvS. Could have been great but ended clichéd. Too bad.",Suicide Squad

1859,brendontflint,Wasted Potential,6,29 July 2021,"The setup seemed to be quite decently established with this band of villains but what truly killed it was the godawful and pointless plot. With the same characters and majority of the beginning, the entire film could've been salvaged by removing the concept of witches and fantastical magic and replacing it with some sort of decent villain. What detaches various DC films from the audience is their overuse of unrelatable cgi monsters. An additional low point was the hordes of grotesque alien henchmen created by the enchantress. It feels at that point more like a video game, as if it's become an endless onslaught of fighting with no difficulty, stakes or actual point. When your monsters are as fragile as glass why bother transforming the body if all it does is make them more susceptible to death by blunt force. But honestly, this movie does have various highlights which I believe are sadly overlooked. Harley Quinn's debut was quite legendary to say the least. Dead shot, Rock Flagg, Captain Boomerang and even Amanda Waller seemed to do their jobs extremely well which further saddens me as to the disservice that was this shoddily put together plot.",Suicide Squad

1868,itsmiajohnson,Good for other reasons than a great plot,7,8 May 2021,"Many of the reviews speak negatively about this film which I would agree with to a certain extent, but not fully. The main issue with this film is how disorganized the plot is. At points I was sitting here saying ""what just happened?""; there were also many subplots that were interesting but a bit out of place. On the other hand, I feel that if you have the ability to analyze the film on a more nuanced level, you could get more out of it. For example, the villains are hired to use their powers to do good, but what they get out of the deal is never properly documented prior to them being hired. This turns into the governmental group manipulating the villains and pulling out more from them than they are given in return. Comment on society right there, but many people could miss this. Another point that is interesting is when one of the characters comments on his appearance claiming ""he's a monster because he was always treated as such"". Another comment on how the US handles criminals. Nevertheless, the ending is a bit cheesy and could have been done better.",Suicide Squad

The whole point of the suicide squad in the comics was to perform black-ops type missions that could be repudiated by Argus if needed. They aren't the ""anti-Justice league"" or any sort of bad guy complement to a good guy hero team. So, instead of a grounded, edgy movie, we get blown up special effects similar to the last half hour of batman vs superman. Between MoS, BvS, and now Suicide Squad, I'm beginning to think that the DC cinematic universe is beyond saving and needs to be rebooted.

1872,neoquantum,Just another summer popcorn flick,7,7 August 2016,"I was really looking forward to this movie, just like other reviewers on this forum. All in all, this was a very entertaining summer flick. I usually have a rule to stay away from movies with too many superhero/villain characters. I was a little intrigued by the Suicide Squad source material and with all of the Marvel/DC overload of superhero movies it breathes new life into the genre. This movie was neither good nor bad in my opinion. Just down right, gritty fun. The only complaint is the editing is a bit shoddy and a few characters are introduced without a background story, which gives away future events to come. Each character is likable in their own right. Harley Quinn and Deadshot are the most standout characters of the squad, brought to life by Margot Robbie and Will Smith. I usually dislike Will Smith performances, but he does a pretty good job with this character. Margot Robbie is a little over the top at times and as the movie progresses she develops a Brooklyn accent, which is kind of annoying. As for Jared Leto's take on the Joker, I am kind of on the fence about what to think about it. What can you do with the character that hasn't already been done? Gangster him out? This is what we get in this iteration of the character. Some scenes seem almost embarrassing to even think that Leto is an Oscar winner. But, some part of me wanted to see more of him on screen and I really can't explain why. The chemistry between Harley Quinn and the Joker are very genuine, which could quite possibly spawn a spin-off film. As for other Squad members, everyone did a great job with the characters. Two of my favorites of the Squad, other than Harley Quinn, were Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney) and the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne). As for the story line, it seemed a little rushed and thrown together. I was a little disappointed about that aspect of this movie. But, I went into this movie with an open mind and I wasn't expecting an Oscar contender. Summer movies are meant to entertain, not intellectually stimulate. Those movies come out in the Fall.",Suicide Squad
1873,hhahn-87650,Loved this movie,9,2 September 2021,Enjoyed the thrill. Showed almost everyone's general story; considering the cast. Will smith was amazing. The joker was legit.

1874,bfa-phact69,Really bad. Worse than Batman v Superman,1,6 September 2016,"Simply, to put it in perspective, comparing this to current Marvel movies (and I'm not saying Marvel is the standard here) this looks like a typical mid 00's *tryhard* superhero (that's right-not a villain) movie. And I bet that Joel Schumacher (77) is responsible of that. The script is a complete mess in its entirety. 70% of the lines delivered felt not just cheesy but outright forced. The editing is just... I mean they even have those slow-mo scenes that emphasize the intensity of action, but in reality they only make you think that time is running slower for that one guy. The pacing is even worse than in BVS. Not only that it made me not care about the characters in this movie, but it made me care even less about the Batman cameo (witch I, as a Batman fan, naturally looked forward to). If the script writers didn't know how to paint a picture about a lovable or semi-lovable villains there is a whole world out there! They could've just copied some random villain story that actually made you really care about the characters. They could've even went the opposite direction and pull a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" on us and no one would even notice ! But no ! Instead they just jammed five 2-3 minute long scenes at the beginning, that poorly describe five characters. They could've easily taken that out completely and replace it with actual plot details. And maybe then it would actually hold my attention at least as an action movie ! As far as ""plot"" goes this... thing has almost none. By the end I actually started asking myself too many questions that I would care to remember right now. It almost made me upset. I also got the feel that, by the end, actors kinda just hated being there on set (?) I mean I don't know if it's just me or what, but it seemed like that they just wanted to get this over with and go home. I genuinely felt that way, I am not just adding to the pile.And lastly I really need to say this. I love Jared Leto - I really do. But this is, by far, the worst Joker on screen EVER ! What is he? A hustler? A swag mob boss? A pimp? Harley's knight in shining armor ? He is anything BUT Joker ! I still really, really hope that this is just Dick Grayson and the real Joker is somehow gonna appear in Ben's Batman films. Because this is just... they are well below ""Batman and Robin""(1997) level at this point. I would watch that movie and still enjoy it for what it is. But man.. this is not 2001 anymore. In fact the only difference is the budget and advance in computer and practical effects. Mr. Schumacher, is 2016. You could get away with *good garbage* in the late '90s and mid 00's but doing the same thing-now, just makes it garbage.",Suicide Squad
1875,james-turnbull-124,A Very Fun Film,7,27 August 2016,"First of all every one is entitled to their own opinion and this is mine.I was not that excited for Batman v Superman, the trailers didn't wow me so I was not that surprised when it wasn't that good.The trailer for this film however were amazing and for me the film lived up to the hype.Will Smith and Margot Robbie were perfect in their roles of Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Actors that surprised me were Jay Hernandez as El Diablo (who I haven't seen anything from before), Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang (who is pretty bad in almost everything he is in) and Jared Leto as The Joker.The plot is simple enough, a group of villains are forced to team up and fight a bigger evil. There is great chemistry between all of the actors and they all seem to have a blast at making this film.Although there was not a lot of The Joker I liked the portrayal of him and look forward to seeing him more whether in a sequel or a stand alone Batman film. El Diablo was the biggest surprise for me, knowing nothing about the character he had the biggest arc and became the most sympathetic after hearing his backstory about how he killed his family. Slipknot is a character who is marketed as part of the squad which he barely is, he is just there to die (which was hilarious) to prove that the squad has to do this mission or they to will die.The story is straight forward and the film stands on its own unlike Batman v Superman which crammed in way too many plots and character.All in all I really enjoyed it, it was a fun film and it seems like DC is heading in a good place after a bumpy start and I look forward to seeing these character again and future installments in the DC Cinematic Universe.",Suicide Squad
1876,BlaM_DD,I actually kinda liked it,7,9 September 2018,"As someone who is not so much into the DC universe I actually liked this movie.

I had my fun with it.",Suicide Squad
1877,sdeuces90,Do not see what the hate is all about,10,5 August 2016,"I just saw the movie last night and I was actually surprised, pleasantly, to see what was on screen because the reviews have been so shitty; Rotten tomatoes has it at a 27% but Metacritic has it at 51. Anyway, the movie starts off great with Waller introducing the characters via montages and pleads her case the two men. The military is then brought in to hear Waller's plan and when the General says no, Enchantress gets introduced. Waller controls the Enchantress because she possesses the heart of the Enchantress and shows that off when the Enchantress doesn't return to human form by stabbing the heart. General gives Waller the greenlight on Task Force X. After the meeting, in a hotel, Enchantress wakes up Flag and then teleports to Waller to take her heart but Waller has a sensor on it. Enchantress then teleports to Midway City and takes over a stranger in a subway, turning him into her brother AKA the muscle. He wreaks havoc in the subway and molds into a being, looking like a metal pharaoh- like being. The General then sees the mess, via subway camera, and gives the OK to Task Force X. Waller gathers the team together and then they are on their way. A subplot in this is the Joker. The Joker wants Harley back because he misses her. He has a few scenes where he is trying to locate her whereabouts. He gives Ike Barinholtz's Griggs a cell phone to give to Harley to let her know that he's coming for her. To speed up the review, they wind up in Midway City to extract a person of high value from a building and then they are supposed to extract. After losing a lot of soldier to the Enchantress and Slipknot due to Flag killing him, they get the high value target, who winds up being Waller. The extraction chopper comes only to be the Joker and his men. Harley leaves with him but the chopper gets shot down, releasing Harley and having Joker die. Waller gets taken by the brother of Enchantress and they use her brain to attack satellites and ships that are top secret. The squad, after a short bar break to get to know each other better, goes to rescue Waller and Enchantress' human form, June Moon. After Enchantress tries to corrupt their minds with what each member wants in life, featuring a Deadshot killing Batman and Joker n Harley married with kids, Diablo fights the brother and turns into a big, burning entity. After holding him off, Scott Eastwood's character kills himself due to detonating a bomb; this ends up killing Diablo and the Brother. Enchantress has a final battle with the Squad and winds up losing because Harley pretended to join her but ends up slicing her heart out. Deadshot shoots an explosive thrown by Croc and ends the Enchantress. Flag takes the heart and destroys it and Moon comes back.The final scene is to Bo Rhap and shows the squad in prison only to have an explosion cut the music. Men unlock Harley's cage and the Joker reveals himself, ending the movie with ""Let's go home"". The mid credits scene is Waller asking Bruce Wayne for protection of the media that can incriminate her. Bruce then asks for her end of the deal, which is the top secret files of all the meta-humans. Overall, the movie was a lot of fun. It was cohesive and set up a good side story to the DCEU. Marvel is ahead of the curve thus far, but with good directing and writing, the DCEU MAY have a chance. The action was good, acting was good minus a few cheesy lines, like the Flag to Moon exchange at the end, and we get good characters to continue the DCEU with. As a side review on Leto... while not a big role, like around 10-15 minutes combined, Leto captured a very different Joker. Joker is in love and obsessed with Harley. One of the flashbacks is him asking her if she would live FOR him and she jumps into the acid, devoting herself. He then walks away but goes back to save her. It shows his reluctance at first and then his acceptance. He owned the screen and I was wanting more from him each time he was on the screen. He did a great new take on the Joker. A lot was clearly cut out of his role and I don't know why but I am hoping to see that when the blu-ray comes out. Great job by Leto for capturing a predator-like, obsessive monster. His tats, btw, aren't really standouts so I don't see the issue with that anymore. I liked the look of him and his mannerisms as well. Very comic book like Joker in this flick and the Harley love angle was a nice new take. His role, sadly, was 90% flashbacks but his ending scene when he breaks Harley out sets ups some nice potential movies.",Suicide Squad
1878,cbeezy34,Unbiased and spoiler-free review,5,3 August 2016,"I saw an early screening of Suicide Squad, so here is an unbiased review of that film. A little tired of these punk critics using SS to diss BVS and MOS which were actually good films, anywayI like my reviews short and sweet but to the point, but had to extend this one a bit. Action: The action was average and entertaining at parts but most of the characters where underutilized and we didn't get to see them inaction much to really get the idea of how dangerous they were. Dead Shot and Harley had the best action sequences between the squad. Croc would come in 3rd but there wasn't any real standout action sequences. There was one with Diablo that was unexpected and cool, but he only really shined that one time when they could have used him and other characters in cool ways because of their powers and skills, but it was mostly average. Acting: There really wasn't much issue here because everyone played their parts well and strong emotion wasn't really needed since this was mostly aimed to be a fun action flick. Will Smith did his typical stand up which didn't hinder his action since we are used to this. Leto was great as the Joker but his acting was wasted since his character really had no depth or point the central plot. Joel Kinnaman did a good job as the leader of the squad and Margot was pretty much consistent with what we got from the Trailers and did a great job as Harley. Cara Delevingne had a bigger role than the trailer lead us to believe and she played her part well. Again, the acting wasn't the issue with this film, everyone played their parts, though Croc's dialog was hard to understand at times. Story: The story was very simplistic and not well put together. The screenplay was bad on some scenes did not flow perfectly from scene to scene and happened so fast it was hard to grasp or attach or relate to what was happening within the story at that time. In my opinion the story would have been better in a different sequence, so it's not necessarily a bad story, it was just was executed poorly. I understood what Ayer attempted, but it didn't work or mesh together well at all.Bottom line: I believe this movie was a failure mainly because of the Directing and choices made with the screenplay. Ayer and Kinnaman have both publicly denied that humor was added later but some of the jokes were so out of place and not funny it was just a waste of screen time(especially the unicorn thing). We could have used this time to get more action from the characters and a full sequence of why they were so dangerous and what skills they had. The movie felt so rushed and like scenes were missing that would make sense of some questions that we have. There were scenes from the trailers that were missing and you could definitely tell they were missing pieces from this film. The bonds between the characters were absent and undeveloped though this was a 2hr film? They considered each other ""friends"" but there was no rhyme or reason as to why they felt this way and there wasn't a common ground to bring these criminals together in this film because they were all solo acts, so Ayer failed to write a good reason for us to care for them or simply explain why they felt this way. This was important because it created two plot holes based on a decision DeadShot made and one that Harley made that didn't make sense because it wasn't explained why they would do what they did, the connection was completely missing! Last, the Joker was completely underutilized and had no intelligent purpose to the central story or even a side story. Did he have to be the main attraction? No, but Ayer failed to give him purpose and we couldn't connect with the character and get the full grasp of how good Leto did with Joker. He prob would have worked better only in Harley's flash backs and to explain how she got in the position to be in the squad, then maybe a bigger role in a later film. I could go further with the errors made in this film but spoilers would pursue...so with a rushed story, bad screenplay sequence and humor choices, the directing was mediocre and caused this movie to lose value, and held back its potential. I think a cast this big and with all the personalities of the characters, Ayer didn't know how to piece this together at a good pace. Films like Harsh Times, End of Watch, Fury were decent films, but he was in way over his head with SS.",Suicide Squad
1879,theblackthorn,Much better than the critics made it out to be...,8,5 August 2016,"This movie is a blast! It's far from Citizen Kane, but that's not what a comic book movie is supposed to be. It doesn't take itself too seriously and while there are a few pacing issues that crop up, the story line is simple and was easy enough for me to follow. The acting is fine, and there are some great lines; The chemistry between the squad was amazing. It's worth it to see on the big screen for the action scenes (of which there are many). It was witty, cool, and even heart touching. I mean sure, the whole idea is sorta over the top, but man is it a fun summer movie.Ignore the critics on this one; even with some flaws, it's worth seeing.",Suicide Squad
1880,vincent_lee_1983,Suicide Sucks!,1,3 August 2016,"Suicide Sucks . . . 4 / 10 2 points because Will Smith 2 points because I'm DCThis review is Spoiler Free.Firstly i wanna say, if you start to bad-mouthing your rivals, even before your film premiered, it mean you don't have any confidence in your movie. No wonder they don't reveal much plot in their trailer, coz there's no plot at all. And from all 3 DCEEU movies, this one is the most sucks. They still don't learn from their past mistakes, RUSHING THINGS to coup up with MCU only bring more harm than good.My advice to those who decide to watch this SSucks, leave your brain at the door and enjoy montage of clips after clips, hell, there's no story at all, and for the most infamous DC character, those squad is lack, or should i say have a cheesy character motivation.This movie saving grace is Will Smith, not because he's deadshoot, but because Will Smith acting as Will Smith. And for the Prince of Clown? Don't raise your bar too much. Yes he's terrifying, but the Joker here, is only a montage, don't expect he's doing brilliantly insane Joker like in TDR.And what now WB? releasing the ultimate cut again to milking extra money? well, this is the last time i will saw your movies in theatre, 3 mediocre DCEU movie in a row is just too much.As dark and grim DCEU movies are, the future of DCEU is share the same fate, and i hope is not beyond help",Suicide Squad
1881,soumyaapatra2006,Let down by DC Comics again! An impressive start followed by a dull ending. Poor script!,5,7 August 2016,"Expectation: Gee! I was desperately waiting for this movie ever since the trailer was released and it was really SOLID. Hell, who can resist a good dose of Jared Leto (remember his Oscar winning role in ""The Dallas Buyers Club"") and Will Smith. So it's prudent to say that the expectation was really high. After the last DC Comic's disastrous ""Batman vs Superman"", this movie was supposed to be the Redemption. Plot: Viola Davis (""How to get away with murder""), an U.S Intelligence Officer forms a highly volatile yet ""talented"" misfit team of sorts to fight the next Supernatural Force. So Task Force X is born with criminals who are already serving multiple life sentences and hence the name ""Suicide Squad"". Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney as Boomerang, Jay Hernandez as Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Killer Croc, Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag, and Karen Fukuhara as Katana fight together, despite their wishes, against the evil duo aka Enchantress (Cara Delevigne) and Incubus (Alain Chanoine). As far as the characters go, Boomerang (who?) was totally unnecessary with no skills to speak of. The main villain could have been better - Enchantress is more laughable (performs a tribal dance to create the biggest machine of mass destruction) than scary. Performance: Performance wise, Smith is good enough, Joel Kinnanan (""House of Cards"") is fine, Hernandez as a meta-human exhibits zero personality, Viola shows unnecessary attitude. The best expressions were that of Adewale (Croc) and he has scales on his face (I hope you can guess how annoyed I am at DC comics for ruining this one too)But the reason why this movie is endurable is due to the magnificent reproduction of character of Harley Quinn from comic strip to screen by Margot Robbie (to be honest, never realized that this actress from ""Focus"" had so much caliber). The resemblance is uncanny. She hits all the right notes and provides the much needed comic relief in this otherwise dull movie. The parallel love story between Joker played by Jared Leto and Harley Quinn is weirdly good. Leto is good but the moment you compare with Heath Ledger, you start getting sweaty handing over compliments. Ledger has spoiled the scene for the next generation of actors who will play the Batman Villain with an extremely high performance bar. Verdict: The first half of the movie is enjoyable with great songs selection (my brain made an immediate comparison with the wonderful ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") and fun introductions of each character. The second half drags with a predictable end. If you are a Harley Quinn fan, go and watch it. Otherwise you can give this one a miss. P.S: Listen to the brilliant title song: Heathens (Twenty One Pilots)",Suicide Squad
1882,buckharris512,Tries too hard to be 'Avengers (with Bad Guys)',5,5 August 2016,"*Preface* I enjoyed Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice immensely, and I feel like the disappointing reception of BvS may have ruined the tone of Suicide Squad. The movie feels too cartoonish in introducing the characters (of which I feel like there were too many) and takes too long as well. The jokes aren't that great and seem like an afterthought. The ""Bad"" Guys don't feel villainous at all, and feel too non-threatening. The antagonists in the movie start off doing some impressive things but then are sidelined so that we can watch the Suicide Squad tackle zombified people henchmen for reasons? The movie doesn't have enough room to make each suicide squad member interesting. I would have preferred they cut some combination of Katana, Cpt Boomerang, Killer Croc, Rick Flag, and Deadshot's daughter out to make more room for the other characters and more action. Jared Leto and Margot Robie are great and I hope we get more of them. There is one mid-credits scene, and no post credits scene.",Suicide Squad

So much money spent on such a boring and uninteresting movie !!! I don't think that I have done much in life, but I am proud that I am not the one who wrote and directed this movie (more importantly, did both of those at the same time!!!). I have never written a review; however this movie disappointed my expectations at an extreme level - and I have been waiting for the premiere for quite a long time. The rating that I gave to the movie (1 out of 10) is because cast and acting was not bad at all. But even this could not save the movie. 2 years ago I watched the worst movie in the history of the all universes - The Room (2003). I thought that George Eastman would not pioneer using photographic film knowing that such movie would ever be recorded. However, as of now, if I were given the choice to either watch ""the room"" or watch the ""Suicide Squad"" again, I would choose first one without even thinking about it!",Suicide Squad

I think we got to see just the tip of the iceberg.PLEASE RELEASE A DIRECTOR'S CUT! I've heard about all of the extra footage and hope to see it all. The rumors about the studio heads interfering with post production really irritate me. I'm very inclined to believe the rumors, because we're talking about David Ayer here.

What I got from the movie was something I wasn't expecting. It wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the word, but the low scores it's receiving aren't warranted either. There are certainly problems with the movie, the pacing was weird, the editing was the worst aspect of the movie and made it hard to follow, at times. And as far as characters go, I found the joker the most annoying part. Character development could have been a tad bit better as well, you only got the back story on a couple of the characters. And some of the characters felt like your prototypical throw away villains. The story wasn't an overly complicated one, but it was enough to keep me intrigued. There were a few twists, but nothing an average movie goer wouldn't have foreseen. I think the most disappointing thing, for me, is that this title had so much potential, and DC kind of dropped the ball by making an average movie.All in all, even with these problems it wasn't a bad movie. 5 to 6 out of 10 seems appropriate.",Suicide Squad

Full house, big screen, high volume. Yes, I had a great time. The characters are the best thing. They're awesome, especially Margot Robbie and Viola Davis who are killing it. And Jared Leto's Joker is as creepy as expected. But sadly, the script is a bit predictable. The first hour is great fun with lots of dark humor and bad-ass music. But the final hour is just standard (although there is a very good scene near the end of the film I won't spoil here). It feels like bad guys who are just playing superheroes. what they aren't. A missed opportunity because you can do many different things with bad guys you can't do with heroes. I'm missing original, creative scenes and ideas. So its the same story as with the other DC films; Awesome style, great characters. But the script is dull and the story is a mess. I think this would've been better with a comedy director like Edgar Wright or Matthew Vaughn. So I really hope there will be a sequel with a better director.

1898,juliusyeung95,A poor studio made movie marginally saved by the glimpses of Ayer's direction and wonderful cast,2,7 August 2016,"(contains LIGHT spoilers)In what has to be one of the most disappointing movie of the year, Suicide Squad fails to deliver the basics but ends up having more enjoyable moments than its preceding DC films. The biggest issue this film has is its narrative. Not only do they serve us such a thin and shallow plot & story but also tell the thin narrative in such a disjointed way. The hot topic visuals only cover up for a complete lack of style (which is the complete opposite to BvS' stylistic gluttony but lack of substance). Substance in this movie exists but feels like it has been butchered, redone, and forced back in as plastic re-imagining. One of the greatest sins this movie has with its narrative is the poor handling of character development. Instead of staying true to their natures, all the villains of this movie have an inexplicable change of heart that is nowhere near convincing enough. There's great chemistry and performances but terrible bonding period. The team suddenly becomes a group of friends inexplicably as the film goes on. In Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, the movie takes its time to bond the characters on-screen. None of that happens here bar the bar scene. We are meant to suddenly feel sympathetic to Deadshot as he refuses to kill someone important in the movie? For what reason does he decide to not pull the trigger?It's all a shame because the characters, the chemistry, and performances are separately good on their own but as a whole, in this mess of a set-up, fails to make up a good and competent movie. Will Smith and Robbie steal the show as Deadshot and Harley Quinn with great charisma and just general enthusiasm in their roles. El Diablo, Boomerang, and Waller also make up for some really nice scenes and moments (In all fairness, Diablo is probably the only character with good development and believable story-line; so thanks to whoever made the decision to not butcher his story up)! So the main squad and characters actually were good and had a lot of good potential. Every character has at least two good lines of dialogue and the interaction is generally fine. But all we see them do is talk smack and walk around a city participating in lame action scenes and an even lamer finale. Jared Leto as The Joker is a serious missed opportunity. He was great in his performance but there was definitely more of him which was cut out from the movie. He's more of a thug/gangster so that explains his lavish clothing and tattoos but still keeps a creepy and unpredictable vibe. Not much happens with the Joker except he crashes in the party much later than I hoped for.Ayer has done a great job getting the best out of his actors and making sure everything on-screen worked. So the scenes and individual footages themselves are actually not bad. Clearly, the man had a vision and story he wanted to tell. Yet the film ended up being anything but cohesive, footage after footage with no structure just the bare minimum. We're flashed into the introduction of the characters and how they got there which was lazily done. Deadshot and Quinn deserved entire sections of their own, not flash card introductions and brief scenes. The movie just starts randomly and ends abruptly. All of this just confirms what many of us have feared, that all the behind the scenes drama and panic in WB were true and that they have yet again butchered another movie.I sincerely hope they learn their lesson this time. Follow Disney's example by NOT interfering with the movies and letting a creative team produce and make the films ala Geoff Johns like Marvel Studios is to Disney. WB didn't even give Ayer enough time to come up with a proper story then script FFS! All because of marketing deals, panic, and test audience reactions.When will big studios learn? They keep on making these studio made films. They've been doing this forever as well. Most famously ""The Other Side of Midnight"". Seriously, when will they learn?",Suicide Squad
1899,muppet-baby,What The Hell Happened,2,21 April 2018,"Suicide Squad is written and directed by David Ayer and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto and Joel Kinnaman.Despite the constant rage against this movie, I tried to have an open mind while watching it but in the first 7 minutes I was like...'oh no'This movie feels like a drunk person watched some of the trailers and wrote down what he thinks happens, because there are scenes where characters are introduced and a scene later are intoduced again like you havn't met them already. Scenes lead to something completely different. Charcters will feel mad in a scene and in the next feel fine. I've seen movies with bad editing before, but the editing in this...IT KILLED THE MOVIE!Will Smith is given some dumb lines but his charm does come through most of the time. Margot Robbie did okay and I like some of the ideas they had for Harley Quinn but their just not met to their full potential. I thought characters like El Diablo and Katana were kinda cool but they both aren't given that much to do. Then you have Jared Leto as the Joker...he was TERRIBLE, it's like they got Jim Carrey to play him, but he was always on the verge of climaxing!When there are scenes of character development, even if the scene itself is decent I didn't feel anything becuase these people never really connect but at the end of the movie they're all like ""I lost one family, I ain't gonna loose another one"" WHERE DID THAT COME FROM, YOU'VE KNOWN EACHOTHER FOR 2 HOURS!It's almost as if they told five people to direct their own individual Suicide Squad movies and then when they were all done, they had put them all together into one movie.While this isn't an irredeemable awful movie, it really, really, REALLY sucks but it isn't awful, at the same time it is kind of a disaster because they had this much talent infront and behind the camera and they had so many possibilities for this being the FIRST all villains comic book movie and this is what we get.

Harley quinn of course got a lot of screen time and I think people exaggerate when they say she was amazing she tried too hard in my opinion. And the joker was just added in the mix which was unnecessary and just a waste of time. With the avengers you see that click the characters have with each other, you dont get that feeling at all with suicide squad,although great cast assemble, no chemistry whatsoever.The plot was stupid, and the jokes were just there.... the soundtrack though great music it didn't fall in sync with the movie.All in all great waste of time",Suicide Squad

It's for Will Smith, and Will Smith alone. I'm not crazy about Smith or nothing, but I think he made me to sit and watch it till the end. I walked from movies after 30 minutes of Batman V Superman, or let's be realistic here: Man of Steel 2. So, now let's talk about this movie, and I'll try to be profane as little as possible! This movie is bad. And I mean very, VERY bad! I know that DC and Marvel are great foes in terms of competition among two big companies, and every super hero always gets answered by another super hero from the other company and that's old news. What I cannot stand is taking obvious details from competition's films and introducing them in their own movies as something ""new"" or ""out of the ordinary meant to be funny"" case in point: UNICORN from DeadPool now in possession of ""Boomerang- guy(?)"". OK, that's just annoying and cheap, but let's talk about story line: If you EVER seen ANY action movie EVER before, you'll hate this movie. Anyone remember Nick Cage movie ""Con Air""? Come on people, it's the same freaking story with some CGI SF elements added to nobody's pleasure!!!! But even if they did a ""remake"" of ""Con Air"" they could've made those villains be more villain! Steve Buscemi's scene in a pool singing ""He's got whole world in his hands"" is more powerful than every scene with Joker and/or Harley! Even Danny Trejo did better than every actor in this movie! At least he's believable. In SS not even 1 character is believable or consistent with his character. At one point in the movie it's totally the same who says what it all starts to sound the same. It's like they all became 1 character saying meaningless one-liners that serve no purpose whatsoever. I honestly think Batman:Arkham (Assylum, Origins, City etc.)games did better justice to the franchise than every DC movie after Batman The Dark Knight.",Suicide Squad

Joker gets about 15 mins screen time, seriously WTF is with that? Harley is the most entertaining, albeit is crazy, bad role-model-type. Its too much poltergeist, alien, paranormal crap! If I were one of the star actors, I'd delete bit from my portfolio! Its a pity Batman couldn't be more part of the movie, might be its saving grace. I'm beginning to dislike these latest superhero movies...",Suicide Squad
1906,the_fida,Disappointing,4,7 August 2016,"After watching Batman: Assault on Arkham, I had a high hope for Suicide Squad which is being shuttered down to a place where I will be in fear of worse from DC movies for the upcoming years. There were so many characters to tune in but none was tuned in.So many plots could be break out from a single plot but none came out. I thought that Waller might had some bigger and darker purpose behind that Task Force X which was not even hinted. the Joker was totally wasted. And worst of the worst was the villain. Who is writing these plots? Can not they hire the writers from comics or animated movies? It is a not recommended movie for theater goers.You can watch it on Blu-ray without any effort.",Suicide Squad
1907,madhav-desai,It is not well executed,5,16 April 2017,"The dialogues are poor, cinematography poorer. DC requires outsourcing the best of their ideas including Batman and Superman and all of Suicide Squad to Marvel. They can make a much better movie out of it. Deadshot is okay; Harley Quinn is the best, but it could have been much better; others don't have much screen time. Yes, it is dark and requires to be dark, but different. Why even include the Joker in the movie, when he is not playing any good role, just intro to the story could have been done in a different fashion. Otherwise, the Joker could have delivered the final blow. Again DC - this one too like all others - it's a missed opportunity. Please give your characters to Marvel. Suicide Squad in all - is an average movie, not well executed.",Suicide Squad
1908,daniel-grigg,Margot Robbie steels the show,4,25 September 2017,"The music editing and directing are really poor, but Margot Robbie is absolutely fantastic in every scene, while Will Smith, Jai Courtney, Joel Kinnaman and Jay Hernandez are all impressive and likable.Viola Davis has a bit of a one-track part but she does it well; I personally like Cara Delevigne quite a lot but can understand why people feel her character is a bit generic. Decent action. Basically, the music choices are horrible, but for the song during the pivotal Harley and Joker scene. Margot Robbie is absolutely brilliant and Jai Courtney will shock a few of his doubters.",Suicide Squad
1909,coskioy,"Suicide Squad is like a ""mixed grill"": some scenes you will adore, others serve as a side-dish and among them there are things that are a little harder to get through!",7,5 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is like a ""mixed grill"": some scenes you will adore, others serve as a side-dish and among them there are things that are a little harder to get through! But don't let the critics fool you... they made it for the fans. And fans of the franchise won't mind spending 2 hours long on this upbeat adventure that sometimes does get a little messy. But why would we expect a suicide squad to be anything less than messy?Directed by David Ayer the audience is quickly introduced to the squad. Here the DC fans might just nod a long, but for the common folks, this is necessary built-up. They take time to explain each character but there's no denying that Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn intend to steal the show from the very beginning. They bring a nice mixture of charismatic and crazy on to the screen and together with Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flag they carry this movie.Viola Davis is perfectly cast and she definitely shows how to get away with murder but here is hoping that next time she stares in the DC universe, she shows how 'mean' she really is; waving around with a phone never hurt nobody. The same goes for Jared Leto's the joker, who of course has some very big shoes to fill but whom shouldn't be judged to hard because of his little screen time. Those who watched the trailers will be surprised that he might just be the most romantic guy in the movie and that his role really isn't that bad!Batman's and Flash appearance in the movie are fun, and it really shows how quickly DC wants to move forward in to the universe. But sometimes it's better to take it slow... mold it, so it becomes perfect. Only few characters get time to shine, others can be tolerated because they were previously introduced in DC movies. But the character's Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang, who should be shining as they are 'the' squad, are bland and could easily be ignored. Let's not even bring up Katana, who I almost forgot to mention.The plot isn't all that good either.. you don't need a crew of misfits to walk around with knives and guns, smashing heads and pulling hearts. If the Flash is really that fast he could take the Enchantress out by himself. Speaking off her, while Cara Delevingne isn't to bad in her human scenes - it's the obnoxious faces she pulls while trying to rule the world that make your skin crawl. It's uncomfortable to look at and it makes you wish they ripped her heart out sooner.As a fan I enjoyed it. But it takes time to get used to the theme and all the information comes with such speed you wish to just hit the pause button every other scene. Fans understand, to the rest it might be to overwhelming. DC should take a mental note that it has taken years for Marvel to get where they are and just because they are doing well now doesn't mean they won't make mistakes in the future. But DC isn't even remotely out there yet. If they start running before they learn how to walk, they might break their necks. Yes there should be more of Suicide Squad, but a little extra personality would be appreciated. This could've been created easily when it was made a full-on origins story.",Suicide Squad
1910,benzakour-zaid,Suicide squad; good but bad,7,3 August 2016,"I've been waiting for this movie for quite sometime now and I was expecting a bit more than just random jokes ( as DC was criticized to being too dark)and poor dialogues. Don't get me wrong it is still a good movie if you wanna see you some action with couple of explosions and good visual effects with no real expectations concerning the plot line nor the characters played. Lets start with the acting. Will smith as Deadshot was perfect. ( Although I think they should have built up the father and daughter relationship a bit more). Margot Robie played her part well. though Sometimes it was obvious she was forcing herself. Jared Leto, with all the stories about how much he devoted himself to his role he did't get enough time on the screen. We do not get a real glimpse at the real joker. Jai Courtney added some fun to the movie and portrayed captain boomerang perfectly against all expectations. The others actors were just as good and the characters were well introduced to the audience. What have to reproach to this movie is the plot line. There was no real story to stand on. The purpose behind all the whole world domination thing wasn't clear enough. I'm asking DC this small favor, stop investing on visual effects, trying to mix up everything in one single movie. Invest in plot lines, dialogues, the stories. Build something up. Build great stories that would leave the audience gaping, with a feeling of satisfaction and also wanting more. It feels like it's all about business now, adding up big names and too much ads when the real work should have been on the movie itself. Man I miss The Dark knight where there was no need for this much visual effects to cover up the lack of inspiration. I've even liked man of steel. But since B vs S, it feels like there is huge thing missing.",Suicide Squad

I was going in with lower expectations after reading the critics reviews but honestly they must take their job far too seriously as it was a fun film with great action. All the actors played their parts well, especially Will Smith and Margot Robbie. This film also has a great soundtrack and the music suits the scenes perfectly. If there was some criticism it would be that there wasn't really a proper villain. Sometimes the CGI was a little off (you will notice this) but it isn't a great problem. It would also have been good to have some more chemistry throughout the movie, like the bar scene. However, I just recommend watching the film and forming your own opinion.",Suicide Squad

But I went and really was blown away! It brought me back to the feeling i had while watching the Dark Night Trilogy, not perfect in every way, but still really entertaining! I loved this movie! Sure some of the lines fell flat and they cut so many scenes that certain things felt unfinished but it was still great. Jared Leto as the Joker was by far my favorite! There were times when i watched him that i would literally look at my friend with a disturbed expression because he just seemed genuinely psychotic. Ledger's interpretation was great and very witty but i personally felt that Leto captured the craziness better but in a whole new way. and with that said Joker and Harley Quinn were the best. They were fun to look at and they left me wanting so much more!! this movie was definitely a new interpretation, music choices were good but a little cheesy lol, and they left out way too much that could've tied up some loose ends but all in all i was really impressed by all of the performances!!

I could not stand to hear him talk at all!

As a DC fan I really hoped for this to be better, and I actually liked the 2 Superman movies of the DCEU despite what the critics said, but this one big plot-hole of a movie is too much even for me. Jared Leto is absolutely magnetizing as the Joker, and I could even fall for his and Harley's love story, but it feels like Ayer was interested so much in making this movie different, colorful and psychedelic, that he gave up any plausibility or realism, hence the beautiful but silly scene in which they dive into rainbow coloured chemicals. And anyway, you can sell us that a suicide squad of this sort would include Deadshot, El Diablo or the other dangerous criminals with special expertise, but what makes Harley Queen qualify for Task Force X more than any trained soldier? And let's say for some reason her madness makes her an especially ruthless warrior, why on earth would they send her to battlefield with that cheeky outfit and a... baseball club? Deadshot's arc with the lovable Will Smith and the little daughter story was almost compelling, until when the witch offers everyone to fulfill their deepest wish, and he dreams about killing Batman instead of being with his daughter again. I could go on, but to sum it up, this has some great talent and great CGI, and it's certainly different than other comics movies we've seen, but it's silliness makes it hard to really enjoy it.",Suicide Squad

Still wondering why they even used Captain Boomerang. Really did not add to the plot when u have a major hit man like Dead Shot in the mix. Clock King would've been more interesting and u could have done a bit more interesting tech stuff to wow us tech geeks in the audience. Really did not care for the portrayal of the Joker. Too much gangsta - I mean bling and gold teeth? REALLY?!! He just didn't seem like the ultimate Batman arch nemesis.

1922,tcredwing182,Not an Oscar winner but who expects that!?,8,7 August 2016,"Felt compelled submit a review after reading all the poor reviews that (almost) kept me from going out to see Suicide Squad. We have to be realistic with comic book movies folks, these are NOT Oscar worthy movies Never will be. What a comic book movie is is a popcorn gnashing, soda or beer sipping good time in a dark theater with your friends that allows you to escape reality for a few hours. Does Suicide Squad accomplish this? With flying colors! Now is this movie perfect and set a new standard for comic movies? No it doesn't. It has its weak points with some character development and utilization, some questionable editing and jumping around with the plot (maybe a rated-R ultimate edition Blu-ray in the works again?) But nothing so terrible that it ruins the experience. Will Smith and Margot Robbie were AWESOME, and Jared Leto, while I would have appreciated more screen time, makes a great Joker. Overall I walked out at the end satisfied and felt my money was well spent.I love both studios so I have no bias but I do feel DC is still getting going with their new universe and it is unfair at this point to compare it punch for punch with the well established Marvel universe.",Suicide Squad

Unfortunately we got neither.The movie seemed poorly edited. The scenes felt they were hastily pasted together, with no real flow and making the viewing experience uneven.The characters felt poorly thought out. The only person that comes out with some credibility would be Will Smith, but the others not so much. Jared's Joker was confusion. Maggie's Harley was trying too hard to be 'crazy'. As crazy as a crazy straw. And the rest was a dime a dozen.The humour felt forced on, as though they had to re-shoot scenes after the criticism of Batman V Superman being too dark.One of the most disappointing aspects was that a movie about some of the most twisted and interesting characters in DC were reduced to fighting CGI canon fodder. (I love how they were happy to blow up the 'male' bad guy but were willing to try anything to save Cara's character...).I wanted this to be a good movie, I really did. I wanted to like it but after BvS and now this, I now want them to stop and start over and find out what makes DC DC.Unfortunately I feel the poor quality will continue.By the way, can people explain to me how a movie that makes a ton of movie equals to a good quality product?

1924,cbanik_1,Bad! Bad villains!,6,5 August 2016,"It was indeed much better than BvS with lots of comic action and a better direction overall. About the casting, Margot Robbie killed the scene as Harley! The psychopathic behavior with flashbacks of her earlier life was really good! Cara Delevingne was okay'sh, didn't like her that much. Will Smith, on the other hand gave an average performance; not as high as you'd expect of him. Ben Affleck made an appearance after the credits were rolled and Justice League was introduced and a few times during the movie. Now for the Joker, there has been lots of hatred against Leto but as I saw it, Heath Ledger portrayed the role of a psychopath while Leto was performing a rather sociopath Joker! This Joker would really be annoying and somber to those who enjoyed Heath's Joker. The movie is quite fast paced for 2 hours. They could have slowed it down and gone into details. Didn't like the music and they even cut off Bohemian Rhapsody right at the end (which was abrupt and really showed that they were in a hurry to pack up a movie in 2 hours).

The characters are all completely useless and boring. The ending is jaw-dropping stupid, I still can't believe how dumb and nonsensical it is.When I was in 7th grade I had to write a little story. Something like 6 pages or so. For some reason I've kept it, and it was way better that this crap. And it made much more sense. It didn't, mind. Only, this mess managed to be so much worse anyway.Watching the trailers it was totally unclear how could it make any sense to assemble such a team, why would anyone do that, who exactly were fighting together, against whom, and what was point of all those apparently useless characters. And guess what? Makes no sense to assemble such a team, the confused editing made not entirely clear how or why the villain was created, no reason is given about why the gazillion actual heroes do nothing to stop her, and all the characters are exactly as bland as they promised to be.Also, in case you were wondering, the 3D is completely useless except during the opening and closing credits. Not that it is ever useful, but, you knowThere is one funny joke. The single good thing about the whole movie.

1926,mandeena,Creative Re-imagining,8,7 August 2016,"Every time a new comic book inspired movie is announced the same things happen. 1. Announcement: Die hard fans rejoice and start blogging about what BETTER be included. 2. Actors are revealed: Die hard fans begin with the hypercritical BS 3. Costumes are revealed: If the designer strays from the iconic costumes at all or dates to completely re-imagine the character, people lose their minds! 4. Trailer Released: Vloggers and Bloggers dissect every freaking second of the trailer and break down their theories of what will be included in the movie. Since Vloggers and Bloggers are typically die hard fans themselves, this could get other fans' hopes up about certain story lines being included in the final product. 5. Movie is released: People flock to the theater even if they've been disappointed by the casting, costuming, and trailer. It's not surprise that those same people post all over social media ""Sooo disappointed!"" or ""Don't waste your money!"" The die hard fans turned super critics always use their fan status to backup why they're right about the movie being awful. They say things like ""I really wanted to like it!"" and ""I grew up with these characters!"" and of course ""I've read ALL of the comics!"" To these people I say, get over it. Characters and story lines are reinvented all the time! That's what keeps them relevant and attracts new fans. Stop setting yourself up for disappointment by creating a checklist of what you WANT to see out of a movie. Now, on with my actual review! I really enjoyed it! I didn't have any expectations going into the theater, but I left smiling, and isn't that what a good summer blockbuster is all about?! What I wasn't crazy about: I loved that all of the trailers made it seem as though Enchantress was going to be part of the squad, so when she ended up being the villain it automatically changed what I was planning on seeing. However, Enchantress was probably my least favorite character in the movie. Cara Delevingne's portrayal of the character was a bit odd. Her movements seemed more zombie-like than anything else and the different voice used didn't always match up with the actresses mouth. I also thought the CGI made Enchantress's brother a tad cheesy. What I Loved: I actually LOVED the fact that The Joker was NOT a driving presence in the entire film, as this was Suicide Squad and not a Joker movie. I am a fan of this version of the Joker and hope to see the version in future films, but I'm glad the iconic character didn't steal all of the screen time. Continuing on the topic, I was relieved that the couple of Harley and Joker was presented as more of co-dependent relationship, rather than her being hopelessly in love with a man who only uses her. This version of the pair still has all of the dysfunction you'd expect, but there's an added element of blind devotion from both parties. I mean, The Joker from the original animated series would've never gone through so much effort to get Harley back. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie really nailed the twisted bond between the characters and added an unexpectedly human and sincere element to the relationship I loved that Killer Croc got his moment to shine by swimming into the sewers. I was worried that he'd just be the token 'big ugly' member of the squad. I was also happy to see El Diablo be the one who really saves the day by sacrificing himself. I loved the transition from a disjointed group of villains and a reluctant Rick Flag to an actual team that cares about each other's welfare. Honestly though, one of my favorite elements of the movie was the soundtrack. The music of each scene sets the tone perfectly! In short: if you just want a live action version of the comic, stay home. If you can go to the theater was in open mind though, it's completely worth seeing!",Suicide Squad

Lets start off with the soundtrack. It was amazing. Every song played was perfect for the scene and got your heart going. Casting was one of the best i've seen. Will Smith as Deadshot was perfect. Very intriguing backstory making you want to see him in a solo film. Perfect mixture of seriousness and jokes. Margot Robbie as Harley was perfect. Exactly like the comics. Perfectly portrayed. Everyone else was amazing Kinnaman's acting was really good as Rick Flag. Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang had me laughing for days. Now time for the one everyone wants to know about. Jared Leto's Joker. Fun. funny. evil. crazy. DIFFERENT. He adds this type of swagger that you've never seen in Mr. J before. He has aspects of both Nicholson and Ledger. But he also adds his own style which makes you want to see him more. The only problem with Joker was that you didn't see him enough. Wee need a Batman vs. Joker solo film ASAP. The main issue was the plot. It was very vague and seems as if it has a lot of scenes cut. Overall not the best but still good. I feel like critics are being so harsh because of the very high expectations it had. I would still recommend going to see it because at the end of the day a review is an opinion and you should see it for yourself. I had fun and am probably going to see it again in the coming days. PURE CRAZY ACTION PACKED FUN.,Suicide Squad
1931,rioren,"Excellent casting, pitiful story",3,7 August 2016,"Freshly watched the movie right after it is aired in France. I have to admit that it turned out to be a disappointment.Good:The casting is excellent. Led by Will Smith, the principal actors have all delivered remarkable job. This is the only thing that made me stay the whole length of it.Bad:The story is so badly done. I don't want to comment on the exact story line since it would be too nice to say that it contains a story. However, I get it, for a super hero movie, we don't necessarily need a kick-ass story to appreciate it. The thing that annoyed me the most is the hypocrisy in the marketing campaign of the movie. Let me put it in a separate paragraph:If you claim that this is a different super hero movie, and there's no classic characters and they are all villains, YOU HAVE TO HONOR YOUR WORDS!The whole movie was filled with a classical mentality of ex-villains repenting his wrongs. I'm sorry but this is nothing near ""evilness"" and craziness you claimed in the ads.There's NO ONE in this movie that is just evil or bad in this story. Joker and Harley are both quite impressive, but they are more of a symbol of craziness than evilness. All the other guys are dumb and optional. There's so much wasted potential. Maybe some of you will not like this review and feel that I'm against something abstract like ""A classical American Righteous Mentality"". For people that are so used to this, let me point out one thing explicitly: Having done something bad at some point of one's life then repenting it over a long period of time is simply called LIFE. The actual evilness starts from the moment you decide that you are NOT sorry about what you did and you'll continue to do so. The moment you repent, it certainly won't make you innocent nor free of the consequences, the evilness is gone.If you are expecting a movie that delivers the actually human struggle and evilness, I'd say don't waste your time on this one. If you are just into special effects and like those actors, you might give it a go.",Suicide Squad

I enjoy very much action films, and I love superhero movies as much as I enjoyed comics when I was a kid, but the plot of Suicide Squad is so chaotic and poorly developed that it is hard to believe that someone agreed to participate in this movie. The direction is messy and the SF and CGI are really expensive, and somehow wrong and misplaced.

1933,Ike_McAdoo,i agree with a little bit (much) disappointed.,5,7 August 2016,"all the best parts are in the trailer. i was psyched to see it but gave it a five. definitely not the worst movie i've ever seen but far and away a let down with all it had going for it. will smith phoned it in. Jared Leto: superfluous. Margot Robbie: best role but she couldn't carry an entire movie.no surprises, Viola Brown was contemptible but not even worth hating. this was no guardians of the galaxy, lame compared to Deadpool, it wasn't even as good as Ant Man and that was a kid's movie.apparently i have to add more lines. Cara Delevingne is so ordinary looking since she gained weight. she's just a poor man's Kim Alexis 35 years later. someone taller with an Angelina Jolie body would have been so much more witchy.i don't know who the goofy batman stand-in was either.save your money and rent it on Redbox.disappointed.",Suicide Squad
1934,tkilichowski,"Definitely not so bad, as a lot of people say",7,17 November 2016,"I don't really know what people expect when they watch a movie about famous villains from DC comic books. I know comic books can be deep and complicated, difficult and classy. But hey - this is not one of these! If you like and have read DC comic books over many years you probably should expect something like this movie - at least for starters. Then we might get something deeper. Right now it's light, not complicated, entertaining and sometimes funny. Some roles are great - I myself loved Harley Quinn's, Jokre's and Deadshot's performance. If you expect the film about DC villains to have drama, romance, deep relationships or complicated analysis of human morality in it - stop right now and go watch something else. This is FUN movie. And it's good if you start thinking about it like that. I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to anyone who likes not very sophisticated comic books about meta-humans. It's fun!",Suicide Squad
1935,michael-309-636173,Justice has an ugly side... a REAL UGLY side.,1,8 August 2016,"Don't know exactly how to sum this up except that Ayer along with Snyder are going to be the death of any decent DCMU series. Wait, they are the death of the DCMU series. This one is worse than ""Dawn Of Justice"" (though I really liked that flick) in terms of pacing, direction, dialogue, characterization, and plot - what makes it different is the total miscasting of everyone except Marogot Robbie, who would be awesome if they made her less-sexualized and not white trash ICP looking. The only thing that was enjoyable was seeing Batman. Just a shame these rouges are one-dimensional juggalos he has to clean up after.",Suicide Squad
1936,daniel-pa,Missed opportunity,6,12 August 2016,"The movie had a great premise and a good cast. The end result is a mediocre movie and the blame can be put on David Ayer. He wrote and directed the movie so there is nowhere to hide. There is no transition from the totally bad guys to the there is something decent inside me"" characters at the end of the movie. The biggest disappointment is Jared Leto. His make up and acting blocks any real empathy and it made me long for the character played by Heath Ledger. Next on the disappointment scale is Cara Delevingne. After Paper Towns I was expecting more, but this movie showed she cannot play anything else than herself. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis manage to put life in the dead body of the movie and it only makes you sad that they were so little used in a movie that had so much potential.",Suicide Squad
1937,victoria-mazureck,I don't usually write reviews...,2,14 December 2016,"But this movie made me reset my password on my old IMDb account so I could. I don't really know why Rotten Tomatoes has been bashed because it gave a 29% which after seeing the movie seems totally justified, actually it is the perfect score for this movie. You feel like nothing is happening despite the story advancing, the characters are very poorly developed and when they try giving a back story to the character it just falls flat you just wish they hadn't. I was really hoping that the critics were being harsh not enjoying the comics world and bearing in mind the bad reviews I was pretty open for the movie to be even average. What a let down. P.S : Cara Delevingne should stick to modeling and will definitely not received the award for Best Actor/Model (and not the other around ;) )",Suicide Squad
1938,andrew-m-f-rice,So angry I got off my lazy arse and was compelled to write,1,7 August 2016,"Firstly I am not intending to give the pretence that this is ranked at the bottom of the worst movie ever made. However, it is awful enough that combined with the complete disappointment I felt after watching, it deserves a novice review from me.(I would like to point out that I am a relapsed comic book enthusiast that has only taken up interest in recent years and while originally I liked Marvel I have a soft spot for DC especially the new 52 Joker concept so DC fans excuse any ignorance) I was originally excited for the release during the beginning of the marketing campaign. Although the Joker design had some questionable choices (tattoos etc) I gave it the benefit of the doubt. Aesthetically the characters looked spot on and I commend the costume designers and trailer editors which is as far as I can go.The first problem I have is with the character development. Whoever made the decision that they where going to develop the characters by having short background montages fit in awkwardly to a conversation between Waller and a Military Officer at the beginning of the film really doesn't understand how to effectively introduce characters. It is not always necessary to do origin flashbacks to introduce characters and even more so to do all of them. It was as if the studio felt like they had to give everyone the same screen time but not giving a single one enough. I have watched the Assault on Arkham anime and you can go into that not knowing anyone but still be entertained. Harley Quinn was the only character that you get a slight connection with but even that is stretching the definition. When I read in previous reviews about the irrelevance of the Joker narrative I now concur and can completely understand why Jared Leto was angry at the cuts. Whether he was good as the Joker is hard to even argue as you barely have time to judge and what was most annoying is a scene in the trailer where his face was burnt and that looked like a suitably promising scene was completely cut.That moves me on to my second grievance where I remember a moment the Joker introduced Harley Quinn with the line going something like ""let me introduce...THE EXQUISITE... HARLEY QUINN!"". It felt awkward, cringe-worthy and completely out of place. It was the sort of dialogue that made you feel as though you where being personally patronised. As others have mentioned it arouses much suspicion that the film was heavily edited after the cut by a studio intervention. Whether that is true is neither here-nor-there, but what is frustrating is the forced through lines such as the added comedic punch lines that where so misplaced they where no longer funny. I recall a line where a guard made a request when threatened with a gun that his colleague shoot his killer and ""delete his browser history"". Fair enough joke and would be funny in the right place but trust my word the juxtaposition of the mood, music and narrative was off by a mile.Following on was the music. My word, now I realise why this movie cost so much to make. For the first 40 minutes you are bombarded with every edgy hit song of the last 60 years. Half of which where introduced for less than 10 seconds at a time. This is possibly the biggest clue that some producer must have intervened. Someone must have watched Guardians of the Galaxy and thought ""That mix tape was a hit, lets top it by dumping everything we can find in the first half of the film. It could look like one GIGANTIC music video. Yeah I remember MTV"". If they didn't do it I can't imagine how the sound director got his job.Finally, the plot and this is the shortest paragraph I will write. There barely is one. As I mentioned previously the Joker narrative, which could have been developed on further, wasn't necessary and with the music video/character underdevelopment and a barely suspenseful finally that's pretty much it.There is more I could say but my anger is descending and I am back to being lazy but I will leave you on this note: DC needs to go at this project not trying to be Marvel. If they continue to do so they will lose patience with there potential audience and lose the big revenue they are seeing. It won't be a cash cow if it is meager imitation. Be f***ing original like you where with Nolan (that doesn't mean be Nolan again).",Suicide Squad
1939,rohoo_01,Big disappointment,1,13 August 2016,"So many characters and no fun, no depth. Unlogical bullshit story, all highlights are in the trailer. Why all the fuzz about the Joker, he does not add anything to the sort of story. Nothing is achieved with all of these different characters and the story of Deadshot is sobbing bad. Harley Quin is too slow, didn't the writers look at the essence of Deadpool? Only stole a fluffy horse from it, which adds nothing. And they stalled the movie to add extra jokes in it...but making a funny remark and then waiting for laughter kills a movie. How boring was it before??? And the story lines go nowhere and are inconsistent. And why can you kill an enemy creature whit a baseball bat and not bij shooting a clip through them. And where is Harley's war hammer? And who cast-ed this lady in charge of the operation who has to be saved herself? Total stupidity.",Suicide Squad

1941,danigrl979,It's a fun ride,8,15 August 2016,"I am super excited DC is expanding its film universe. In the reverse of Marvel, Suicide Squad starts with a lot of characters in one movie and I hope many more individual movies to follow. In short, the movie does have some short-comings. The villain (Enchantress) is awful and wiggly. There was not enough investment in June's character to make me care about her/Enchantress' outcome. The pacing is off and felt a bit like a giant trailer to me. That being said - I had a great time and really enjoyed it overall. Deadshot and Harley stole the show, but the other characters were well acted and enjoyable. I wish there had been more joker - I really did enjoy Leto's fresh take. I thought Leto balanced the psychological nightmare that is the joker with his comic style that is his true origin. I loved the stylized take and crazy look. I also enjoyed the romantic undertones between him and Harley, although I am aware this is a step away from source material. Harley and Joker definitely deserve a full film to explore their characters and often abusive relationship - this just wasn't the movie for it and they didn't have the time which is OK. The movie was fun and energetic. Also the soundtrack was simply impressive. At the end of the day, this was a fun movie and a great introduction to what I hope are more narrowly focused DC characters.",Suicide Squad

Let's hope someone at DC figures this out and stops making these turds. I mean where this all go from Nolan's Batman...I would rather watch 5 Seasons of the Iron Fist, which wasn't very good, but still in a entirely different League compared to this over CGI'd, soulless, shoddingly casted, miss-written stinker of a movie.No, just no.",Suicide Squad
1943,jdolan74-355-223633,Best Comic Book Movie Ever!,10,4 August 2016,"I'll keep it simple. I'll start by saying, never forget that movie critics trashed Apocalypse Now when it came out. Is Suicide Squad as good as Apocalypse Now? Hell yeah it is! It's the perfect comic book movie. Cuts away like Family Guy to show us the awesome exposition rather than just say it. Everything with the Joker is perfect. But he is the conduit to get us to Harley Quinn. This is her movie, not his. When watching BvS I understood why some critics didn't like that movie. I didn't agree, but I understood. I have no idea what these critics who are trashing this movie are smoking. Or maybe it's what they're not smoking. Maybe they thought they were getting a Joker movie and they got a Suicide Squad movie. Will Smith and Margot Robbie owned this movie. It was so much fun to watch. I laughed, cheered, even got a little emotional at times with Harley and Mr. J's romance. There wasn't a character in this film I didn't like. Even Adam Beach and Scott Eastwood stood out. Kinnaman was a big surprise. I loved his relationship with Delevingne. Viola Davis was wicked good. Jay Hernandez took what could have been a throwaway character and gave him so much spirit. Jai Courtney and Karen Fukuhara played off each other wonderfully. Killer Croc has some of the best one liners. To sum it up, I just feel bad for anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie as much as I did. I'm glad this movie was exactly what I thought it was going to be. Fun, fun and more fun. I cannot wait to go watch this movie ten more times in the theater. It is simply epic. Best comic book movie of the year, just ahead of Deadpool. For me, up there with The Dark Knight and Burton's Batman. Do not understand at all why this movie got panned.",Suicide Squad
1944,jasonpatrick16,Don't read the negative comments.,8,4 August 2016,"I don't usually write reviews for any DC movie despite being a DC super fan but PLEASE PLEASE go watch the movie without any negative perception from reading the negative reviews.In short Suicide Squad was an experimental film to commence their new franchise, lets be honest there were too many characters to give equal opportunity of a screen time but despite what minutes they had on-screen EVERYBODY did a fantastic job!The action sequences were amazing, Margot Robbie absolutely killed it as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto should hereby become the joker for the next DC flicks.

I really don't think this movie is deserving of all the bad reviews thus far. First of all, if you go into it thinking it's a movie about the Joker, Don't. Get that out of your head right now. It's not a movie about him, it's about the Suicide Squad. Leto maybe has 15 minutes of screen time. His Joker was alright but nothing to write home about. I'm a purist when it comes to the Joker, so maybe that's why his gangster persona didn't really take to me. Overall I thought it was a great popcorn flick, and anyone who is a DC fan will enjoy it. Robbie, and Smith steal the show as their respective characters. Delevigne (not sure about the spelling), also gives a good performance too. It's funny, it's got great action, and it shows some heart too. I understand how people can see that it was kind of piecemealed together, but I thought it flows fairly well. Seeing Affleck in it for those few short scenes has me licking my chops for his solo movie! If you're a fan of DC, go see it. If you're a fan of the actors, go see it. If you're looking for a good summer popcorn flick, go see it! Please don't let the initial poor reviews steer you away!",Suicide Squad
1946,philippeantonio,Was it as Awesome as the Trailer made it to be!?,5,3 August 2016,"Okay, I had huge expectations from this movie because the trailer was one of the best trailers I've ever seen. I was eager to see what the new Joker played by Jared Leto would be like and could he come near or even surpass Heath Ledgers Joker? Come back to that later I will give it to you straight, I left the screening very disappointed The movie falls flat and there is so much wrong that you feel betrayed almost. The story is poor and doesn't tell much at all, you get to know some things about the characters past and what they did to end up in jail, but that's about it. The ""Squad"" don't know one another until they assembles and they have their first mission ever and just like that these ""super villains"" just becomes like family after just one day!? (I mean they literally say that) one of them even compare them to his wife and kids, after one day!? Super Villains!? It goes from one scene to another and nothing important happens, many of the jokes and cool scenes that were in the trailer doesn't at all feels as cool as in the trailer or as funny. And what I was most looking forward too seeing isn't even in the movie as much as the trailer kind of was telling us he would be, I'm talking about the Joker What you get to see of him looks cool but you never really get to see the characters full work, there is so much left too see and that you want to know about him. He doesn't feel complete at all and it's sad because he had SO MUCH potential! It's clear that we will see him again but I really feel that they should have used him more in this movie. The scene with the line ""I Can't wait to show you my Toys!"" was even CUT out from the movie! Why!? Some of the scenes were cool but many seemed to prepared and weren't played naturally by some actors, unfortunately one of them was Joel Kinnaman (our Swedish star) that honestly wasn't that believable as Rick Flag. However there still was some good things and the best of it was the Soundtrack! Amazing music trough out the whole movie. Margot Robbie who played Harley Quinn also did an amazing portrayal of the villain and stood out most from the performances of the Squad. Will Smith and Jared were good too. Overall, it was mediocre, I really feel this movie could have been SO much better and it doesn't do the trailer justice. It's not near epic but it has some entertaining moments, not at all a good story but a few good performances blend that in together and you get something okay.",Suicide Squad
1947,iman-hanif09,Worst Heroes Ever. Best Movie Ever!,10,1 August 2016,"When I watched the movie on a premier screening, I thought to myself, 'Did David Ayer(director)really pull the highest potential to direct this movie? Why was he chosen when they're thousand of other great directors who have made bigger names than him?' He mostly directed bloody and gory films, but this was a litter tamer (little blood) than his other movies. I felt frantic when the movie showed us the first few mins as I'm a big fan of the movie.I rarely wrote reviews but I need this one in my document. Worst heroes ever including Harley Quinn, Deadshot, El Diablo, Katana, Killer Croc and Slipknot, grouped together to form a high elite team after the government hesitant that Superman was no longer a vigilante, but a destroyer of humanity's properties. The first 30 mins was a bit slow as they built up each of the villain's stories.But let me remind you, it has no flaws. When they arrived at the abandoned city, I could feel the nerve started to wreak havoc on my body, the gloomy images were so eerie yet I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen, the CGI was absolutely stunning!Margot Robbie was almost perfect as Harley Quinn, but there were a few times she was trying hard to be Harley. Other times, she pulled her favorable skill to the highest peak! Will Smith was good as Deadshot, it's just that the way he talked reminded me of his past movies. I love Jai Courtney as Boomerang! Many have I talked to claim that he didn't deserve any recognition in the latest Terminator, but I guess he has proved it wrong this time. His character as jinx and bogan attitudes who liked to drink lots and lots of booze suit his acting well. The new girl who held the role as Katana should give a standing ovation. If not mistaken, this was her first acting in Hollywood. Joel Kinnaman played Rick Flag as the daddy of them all, he's like the more aggressive robocop this time, and the only person that he really had a faith of trust was Katana. Killer Croc was scary, El Diablo stole the show when his hands were on fire! Slipknot was the least good, he could only play with ropes. I don't want to judge Jared Leto's performance, people can argue this for days, but he deserved an A+ for it.The action scenes began 10 minutes after they trekked into the city. To cut it short, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE STUNT. I shouldn't have hesitated David at all. Flash made a cameo for a while, should watch it yourself. So hilarious!The $175 million budget ($250 million was a fraud) was wisely spent, I guaranteed people who loved action films would love this movie.

This was very clearly a mixup of every superhero movie stereotype possible, and it didn't work. It could have worked, but it didn't, and I'm as disappointed as the next guy. It was a complete mess of tropes, misused plot devices and characters with no depth. The most disappointing thing about this movie, honestly, is how bad it is. It's not funny bad. It's pitifully bad. It's an uninspired mess who's only light is it's characters, none of who are given enough screen time or good writing to make completely work, despite great acting by Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandes, among others.

1952,dobinsam,Cut to shreds,5,8 August 2016,"The film is cut to shreds and its very apparent. Editing is some of the worst I've seen in a while, it gives the viewer no sense of time and space and butchers the structure. The original vision for the film can be seen under the surface and is even clearer if you look up what was cut. Feeling a little lied to, the advertisements don't reflect the final product and Joker has second billing but is reduced to barley quarter of an hour. His scenes in particular are so ham-fistedly altered and cut to their bare-bones that its very jarring. Dead-shot and Harley Quinn were strong and I enjoyed interactions between the characters yet ultimately came out frustrated.",Suicide Squad

The movie is all over the place from the beginning and doesn't ever quite hit its stride in establishing It's identity as a film. The character development was unconvincingly rushed; in what seemed like no time at all the independent, villainous, metahumans go from being hellbent on revenge and/or escape to becoming a super positive tight knit ""family"". The humour was very hit and miss as most of the intended funny moments felt awkwardly forced and/or geared towards a yonder audience. There were often moments where it seemed they were pushing really hard for a laugh, but instead, it just came across forced opposed to organic. On the upside the acting was solid for the most part and the movie boasted an awesome soundtrack throughout.

Instead, it went way out of line and made it very confusing and ridiculous. I don't think that the overall story is bad. I can really see how this film could have been really good, but it's so obviously flawed. There are some really good scenes and some characters are even spot on, but it's hard to watch some scenes and not really know what they want you to feel.

1955,tonny_hawk8,Suicide Squad Goals Reached!!,7,3 August 2016,"Well for starter this is my first review. I will keep it short but still as good as i can.For starter (technical): The movie has his good and bad moment. Its true the pacing in the first part is bam bam bam bam, and the second is more good. But to give credit its a movie about bad guys and nutheads so the pacing kinda clicks with that. THere are some very beautiful technical shots.The actors all did a good job, yes you can see the cast just loved to make this movie in particular Margot Robbie, its like she just had the time of her life. Will Smith is a good cast for deadshot has his hard (badass) edge and his soft core. THen you have Jared Leto. Well to say he nailed it right on the head. He's creepy and mentally in a good state of mind to play this character. He makes me think about the animated series. Compared to Heath (wich doesn't really make a case) in my opinion they are equal but different. I think Leto struck gold and in my opinion needs more screen time in Batman flicks or maybe a Solo movie (killing joke esq) Diablo and boomerang just nailed everything on there part. FOr the Plot and villain. There are some holes in the story where i didn't really know why it happened. That asside it clings together.TO conclude: The critics made some arguments that aren't to be discussed with. But To say its a bad movie and another fail for DCEU -> ITS not i think this is a very good step forward for the whole DCEU. Comparrason with BvS: Its lighter, funnier but in a way still dark and thats what makes DCEU apart from Marvel.

Overall, I want more Joker scenes and way less character introductions. I was really confused as to why the joker completely disappeared than reappeared in the last scene of the movie. I think I cannot have a valid opinion on Jared Leto's acting has the joker due to the fact there was so little of it, not even trailer scenes where in the movie!

People are trying to compare this to Marvel films where they have had years of putting the back-story of each character. Jared Leto was exceptional as the Joker, he brought HIS Joker and left the rest behind. There was just NOT enough of him in the movie but the scenes he was in were exceptional. Cant wait for the next movies with him as the Joker. Margot Robbie was just the perfect Harley Quinn, she played the Jokers on/off again girlfriend psychotic perfectly. She nailed it! Will Smith was perfect as Dead Shot and the leader of the group, I loved Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje role as Killer Croq. He had just the best lines. I just fell in love with him. Didn't see enough of Kevin Eastwood. Cara Delevingne did just a fantastic job for her 1st time on the big screen. Loved Karen Fukuhara as well. The funniest was Jai Courtney and this bad-ass who likes stuffed unicorns. This is by far the best film to see over the summer. Even twice so you can see what you missed the 1st time.

1958,catt1972,DC need to slow the hell down,4,16 October 2016,"When Marvel first started their own hero universe, they started with a lesser popular character in Iron Man. This first phase culminated in The Avengers which absolutely redefined multiple heroes sharing a single film.This same template of taking small steps into making something bigger has certainly paid off, due to the involvement that we have with all of the characters.DC take note of this. With excellent talent on board, DC seem to rush the universe that they are trying to construct. As a consequence, we have rushed character development and little or no sentiment towards them.With Suicide Squad this applies in spades. About 30 minutes in, there was an element of interest, but this dissipated into clock watching as I waited for the finale.For a lot of crash bang wallop, this was one boring film. This was a comic book film in its literal sense as most of the story telling was so 2 dimensional.DC have some of the most prestigious heroes and villains in comic book history, but with Warner overseeing the development of the film universe I can only see disappointment.I can only see further woes in the up and coming movies (especially as they have Zack Snyder leading the Justice League flick. Don't mis understand me, before MOS I actually liked most of Synders films)I can say that the inclusion of Ben Affleck has been the most positive of all of the DC universe developments.

For the first 30 minutes I didn't feel that the movie had actually begun !!!!, I didn't even know if it was a long flashbacks or the real time-line of the movie is that boring, then suddenly it became a crowded chaos disaster. The characters in my opinion don't fit with the story, and about Amanda Waller she wasn't only a crazy bitch but she was also even worse than the so-called villains or the bad guys, She killed her own team !! the good people just because they weren't supposed to work on such classified data !!! so why did she even bring them ?!!! I think Deadshot and Diablo were the best in that crap.I'll not talk about Harley Quinn or The Joker because I don't want to remember their roles Finally I think the movie wasn't written well and of course not well directed.",Suicide Squad
1960,sagamartha1,Stereotype Squad,1,3 August 2016,"Just awful -horrible dialogue, zero premise. Stereotype Squad as far as characters concerned...in particular the Asian 'character' which was obviously a laughably cynical afterthought and the Boomerang Joe or Pete (I didn't care) - I mean, come on! Will Smith seemed embarrassed or wincing delivering his lines -hard to tell -and as for Jared Leto's OTT indulgent 'acting' -sheesh. Margot Robbie was probably only one whose character had a few good lines. Sad to see the otherwise incredible actress from Secrets and Lies reduced to the ridiculous boss character. The CGI was awful, particularly the monster at the end. Didn't make me feel anything toward the characters -no emotional resonance whatsoever.",Suicide Squad

I struggled to find much meaning behind the plot and some of the acting was very ""cheesy"" and I generally didn't enjoy it. However, on a positive note there was so very cool graphics and action in the film and there were a few interesting scenesAlso I went with 2 friends and one of them really enjoyed it so it could just be me who doesn't really appreciate the film that much.I would not rush out to see it but it is still probably better than some of the other crap being screened at the moment.",Suicide Squad

1964,killerqueensa,"Nothing to see here, move along.",1,9 January 2018,"It's kind of rare to see a film that fails on every level, but Suicide Squad manages. It fails as an action movie by having the Power Rangers Putty Patrol as the most frequent antagonists. Most fight scenes are shot in the laziest way possible, and combined with the film's pacing you get bored of the action very quickly. The premise (a group of supervillains forced to work together as a black ops team for the US government) is completely squandered by having the main characters have little to no internal or external conflict. They also only ever fight and kill nondescript CG nothings, so there's no point to them being ""villainous"". The plot takes forever to get going, with about 3-4 scenes of Viola Davis telling people they need to form the squad in the first place. We're also treated to Jared Leto's joker, which is just awful in every way and adds nothing to the story, Deadshot's daughter that nobody could possibly care about, Captain Boomerang and Harley Quin who both have jokes that just fall completely flat, and Killer Croc and El Diablo, both of whom seem to exist for slightly to very racist dialogue. Oh, and Katana, who does nothing and is around for no reason, comes in out of nowhere, and who you'll forget about every time she's off screen.The plot is a complete mess, with the overall conflict starting because of Viola Davis starting the Suicide Squad to begin with. The Enchantress, arguably the main antagonist, is another supervillain that just wants to destroy the world for no reason. 
 She has a brother with 2 lines or so that is just a big CG monster that doesn't really do anything but kill Diablo I guess. The main enemies the puttys, are so non-threatening as to be a joke.Oh, also this movie is just really offensive in general. Mental illness is a joke, spousal abuse is a joke, sexual abuse is a joke, people really like to call the only hispanic character ""homeboy"", and the word ""bitch"" is thrown around like nobody's business. So not only is this film a chore at two and a half hours, it's an offensive chore. Don't watch it. Don't watch its sequel, or its spin-offs, or anything else from this crap production crew or David Ayer.",Suicide Squad
1965,shuarinaidoo,Sucide Squad= Opps!,4,7 August 2016,"Sucide Squad, directed by Zack Synder. Had everyone at the edge of their seats. From the hype action of the endless trailers and advertising. I was expecting the most amazing superhero/villain movie. Different from the others.But I got a mess. The movie was slow and the flashbacks were extremely confusing. Especially the Joker(Jared Leto)and Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie)scenes. The joker was deemed dead but came back at the end of the movie. That really irritated me. Also, the editing was off. In scenes. You can here the actors losing their accents. Example when the Joker threatens the man in the science lab. We hear the real Jared Leo voice. Not the maniac Joker voice. Then Harley Quinn seems to transition to Margot's Australian. I was highly disappointed and the trailers really made it look great. I waited eight months for this movie for a knock-off. The losing of villains and the unnecessary action. Jeez. DC is just making more movies, whilst not thinking of the current movie. Its like they just rush. I'm sorry to say this. But Batman vs Superman(which got bad reviews) looked kinda good compared to the shock of this.I mean, go see it. But I regret paying money to see this. It seems they only make these movies for the money. Not the passion. I am obsessed with the DC universe. I really didn't like it.",Suicide Squad

I didn't know much about the characters before I watched the movie but I fell in love with them right away. My absolutely favorite has to be Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, totally crazy but brilliant. Wished the would have made Jared Leot's character The Joker a bigger part though.It was very well directed and made perfectly. They made an amazingly good job mixing all the very different characters but still making everything fit together.This is definitely a move I will be watching many many more times in the future.",Suicide Squad
1967,jvjb,Blu-Ray Review,1,29 December 2016,"This movie in itself would have scored much higher if I had to have bought it on iTunes at the inflated price versus waiting for a Blur-Ray UnDigital copy of it. Because this movie came with such a horrible unwatchable digital copy that I cannot access on any of my 4 devices I am forced to give it a lower rating than it actually deserves. UltraViolet unwatchable not working as it is a complete and utter failure of a system for movies. If the company that made this movie had any clue they would allow users to watch it on any device they own. The failure of the studio to use a decent, or at least working online storage for the movie is mind blowing. Being almost 2017 it's mind blowing that this sort of thing can still happen between movie studios fighting over who gets to make the extra 1/3 of a cent on digital content. As well this Blur-Ray has caused me to loose faith in Google as they allow the service to use their single signon, which is about the only thing that works on their websites. 1/10",Suicide Squad
1968,Lizmetge,A promising looking title that did not live up to its expectations,5,25 August 2016,"Suicide squad seemed a title that was promising and had many possibilities but it wasn't anywhere near as good as it could have been. The film took at least 40 minutes before the story started, it took so long to introduce the characters and face lots of details about some for example Harley Quinn and said little about others. The story line was very basic and could have been expanded further and made more complex. At times I feel like Margo Robbie's acting and jokes as Hayley Quinn were the only thing keeping the film going. The acting was of a good standard but he character development was poor. The cast were quite well known so I expected this to be potentially an award winning film but it was nothing of the sort I even felt my self zoning out at times. The sound tack was great but I hardly heard any of the songs during the film for example heathens and sucker for pain. The ending wasn't great because it left me thinking that there could be a second film but who would find it as the first instalment was so poor. Not worth the watch at all.",Suicide Squad
1969,ampineda,Joker - Merchandising,6,19 August 2016,"During the first minute of Joker, you have seen all about Joker. We had a lot of information about the best performance of Joker by Jared Leto... but at the end, it wasn't the best. For me, the best Joker was ""Heath Ledger"", no doubt, and Jack Nicholson as well. Because when you see them, you believe the role, they are real. Sorry but Jared Leto made a very forced performance, it is artificial. And the problem is that we had a lot advertisements, information, trailers, news... etc.. about he is the best Joker in the history... but at the end is ""Merchandising"".I give a 6 because Margot Robbie, Will Smith and others were great in their roles. And for me the best was Margot Robbie. The role of ""Harley Quinn"" is real, you believe it, it isn't forced, that madness is natural. Margot Robbie is a great discovery, imagine Margot Robbie and Heath Ledger together... should be perfect.The story line is normal, nothing new, you will get fun but it isn't the best super heroe movie. What a pity, DC has the best super-heroes: Batman, Superman, Joker, Harley Quinn... but DC doesn't get all potential.Regards.",Suicide Squad
1970,levon1995,"Not bad, but could have been better",6,6 August 2016,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but there were some issues I had while watching it. Firstly it felt too stuffed. There were a lot of characters and they tried to shove in too much back story. They easily could have had back story movies for most of the characters and then made Suicide Squad. With so much stuffed in it was hard to have a good main story line.Secondly, they spent way to much time trying to capitalize on their female characters. It felt like the majority of the shots were framed to show off Margot's ass in her short shorts.Third, plot issues. They are in the dc universe, show Batman and the Flash within the movie, yet after 3 DAYS of this city being taken over, they still leave it up to this squad of villains? That doesn't make any sense.",Suicide Squad
1971,mike-691-735697,"Exceeded very, VERY high expectations. LOVED IT",10,2 August 2016,"I went to an advance screening of Suicide Squad at Event Cinema George Street Sydney on Monday with my brother and mum.Between us; 3 completely different expectations.I've read comics my whole life (from ALL publishers). Big comic book geek. Huge fan of Harley Quinn from as far back as when she was first created for the 1992 Batman Animated Series. I know everything there is about these characters and had high hopes. This movie gets the characters perfect. I absolutely loved it.My brother is 21, never read a comic in his life. Never watched the Batman or Justice League etc cartoons but has watched avengers, Ironman, Dark Knight and most of the comic book movies from the last 10ish years. Didn't know really anything about the characters coming into the movie. He absolutely loved it.My mum; never read a comic in her life, hasn't watched any of the other superhero movies. She loves romantic 'the notebook' type movies, not really into action, comedy or sci-fi at all, and definitely not the comic book movie genre. She loved it, can't wait to see it again.The standouts for me -Margot Robbie absolutely nails it and does tremendous justice to one of my all time favourite characters in fiction. Could now not imagine anyone else in the role of Harley. Exceeded expectations of a live action Harley Quinn, which I've been waiting for for over 20 years for now. Did not disappoint. Harley Solo film ASAP please.Jared Leto is the most true to comics, true to the character version we've had on film - he's awesome. My favourite Joker (well, behind Mark Hamill's animated joker). Looking forward to seeing more of Leto's Joker in future DCEU instalments.The whole cast is great, so I won't go into details about how great they each played their respective characters, but they all knocked it out of the park. Would be happy to see any or all of them turn up in future movies.I'm gonna see Suicide Squad at least twice more in the cinemas, probably more and then buy it on blue ray the day it comes out. 10/10",Suicide Squad
1972,rap_underground,"Pretty good ideas, but no sense?",4,18 December 2016,"So, I'm pretty late watching this movie and it was all because of the negative ratings everywhere about this thing. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are one of my favorite stars and so i had to watch it eventually. Here are my thoughts.1) They are grouping up a super criminal team for what? There was no threat at that point.2) They knew Enchantress was also in such a bottle thingy, so they know that there is also something inside it?? 3) Waller knows the threat is in that magic bottle thingy, but keeps it in her house and not somewhere safer, where it is secured 24/7? 4) Why did Joker attack a laboratory or whatever? For a military chopper he should rather keep looking for a military base? Unless the most of the other people, i think the playing was OK. I think Will Smith did a great job, Harley Quinn was also not played that bad. The real problem here is, why the plot is so BS? You can predict everything until the end. But the ending tho, ugh. I bet everyone was like ""C'MON FROST KILL WALLER"", when she pulled up the phone but better not. Is this movie for educational purposes? An ending where everyone would be free and would live a peacefully life and they learned their lessons and are all nice now, would be probably more welcome to the viewer. I think the writer sucks, anyways. The effects were quite nice.4/10 One for Will, one for Margot, one for the effects and one for making me less bored for 2 hours.",Suicide Squad

Now let's move to the ridiculous part ""the witch"" and its stupid machine you can't tell what the machine is or what does't do, there is just a ""thing"" circling and a lightning with smoke around it.

1975,parkermccoy2,Rushed and Underdeveloped,3,10 August 2016,"I went into suicide squad with low expectations and not a real eagerness to see the movie, and it still disappointed me beyond belief.The beginning parts of the movie went on for so long with slow and over done introductions of the characters and the characters were still 2D and very underdeveloped. The worst part of this movie was the dialogue, the script of this movie was so poorly written. The dialogue of the characters was so forced and unnatural, the characters saying things that would not be said OK real life, it was written like a bad comic book.Suicide squad is just an underdeveloped movie with too much hype that was rushed into production just for money, a big disappointment and a big waste of the people's time",Suicide Squad
1976,luis_santos_xlv,Wasted Potential.,5,5 August 2016,"Went and saw it last night. It's frustrating because it had so much potential.They don't know what to do with the female cast. Amanda is the only good female role, and that's because of the amazing job Viola Davis does, once again. June Moon and Katana are totally empty shells. And Harley, who is the most interesting and complex character of them all, is used as a simple comic relief, instead of going deeper into her head and the relationship with Joker and her crush on Deadshot. Jared'sJoker is awful. He's not The Joker, he's just a guy in green hair. He got so worried about the ticks and mannerisms that he forgot to act, it's kind of embarrassing seeing him go over the top while you have Viola and Will and Margot giving such better performances without that kind of method acting. And also, The Joker is useless to the story, he's just kind of there sometimes, they don't know where to put him.And the editing is horrible, the movie had three beginnings, and in the third one they reintroduce the two characters they had showed before.In the end, it's way better than BVS, and the cast does a great job and the characters are very interesting, however, it's still not enough. Batman Assault on Arkham is still the best Suicide Squad movie, they should have done that story instead. It made more sense. I love DC, but I still don't like their movies, maybe the next one does it for me.",Suicide Squad
1977,lachlanbradbury,"Ugh, what a mess.",4,14 August 2016,"So, as you may have already heard, this movie has gone through various edits and attempted reshoots which ultimately had left this movie an incoherent and jumbled mess. I was disappointed, but even then I had very low expectations going into this film. If you wanted to see this movie because of the Joker I'm sad to say he has ultimately no impact on the plot and we mostly see him through flash backs - and even then Leto's characterisation of the 'sinister' Joker was a flatline and oftentimes even came across as trying too hard or being cringy. The Joker, along with most other characters have no clear identity or sufficient back-story, and the entire premise of the film is very, very questionable - if this ""Suicide Squad"" is meant to combat threats the scale of Superman and Superman- like beings, why would you use Harley Quinn? What on earth can she do that a Marine with basic training couldn't? Or Dead Shot? What use is an assassin when bullets are useless against these alien threats? Or the Australian? Why on earth would you want an immoral, drunken bank robber who's only schstick is a boomerang knife?This movie has many flaws and lapses in logic and clear concise story telling and desperately wants to come across as funny and light hearted when it is clear watching the footage that it was not the original intention. Compared with a comic book movie of a similar nature - Guardians of the Galaxy - Suicide Squad is incoherent, confusing, and poorly edited. It will leave you wondering ""why?"" about many moments and frustrated that a movie with such potential to be good is simply not. The only award this movie deserves to get is for the trailer.",Suicide Squad
1978,srinath-unni,Not worth your time or your money,4,8 August 2016,"Going in, I really wanted to like this movie. I'm a huge fan of Heath Ledger's Joker and I wanted to see what Leto brought to the table. Also, I read a lot about Suicide Squad being targeted unfairly with unfavorable reviews and wanted to do my part to support it. Unfortunately, I found that the poor reviews were actually well on point. The humor is cheesy and awkward, the story has glaring inconsistencies and plot holes you could drive a truck through, and the acting is terrible (save a couple of exceptions). Arguably the main attraction of the movie, the Joker gets minimal screen time as well. I don't remember the last time it happened, but I actually face-palmed at some of the ""plot twists"" and the extremely cheesy one-liners. It just doesn't seem like Ayer sees his viewers like people with a brain and capable of thinking for themselves. I really did feel insulted by the shallowness of it all, so much so that I felt compelled to leave a review for my fellow movie-buffs. Don't waste your time on this one.",Suicide Squad
1979,pisklu,For every comic book fan,7,31 August 2016,"Fantastic... This movie was made especially for all comic book fans and is great on so many levels. Also way better than that huge disappointment Batman v Superman. But I understand that people who have never read a comic book or don't know anything about the characters, they'll probably lost. But if you're not one of those people, you'll love it. Although some characters are joking around (like they supposed to do) DC is still trying to keep that dark atmosphere from Bvs and MoS and it works great. Overally this movie filled my expectations and I'll gladly watch it again, the only cons of this movie is that it's a bit short.",Suicide Squad
1980,v_the_next_level,Not a perfect film but absolutely worth the watch.,8,6 August 2016,"Let me preface this review with the fact i spend a lot of my time editing and providing CG for indie films.So lets start with the obvious question is the film enjoyable ? YES absolutely. it's well written and most of the characters get really well fleshed out. i strongly recommend going to see this film.lets do a point by point.1. characters. For a film this full of popular and classic characters it does a OK job of balancing them for the most part. Harley Quinn, dead shot, rick flag and el diablo get the most emotional weight to their characters. you find yourself empathizing with them.that said the film fails to develop captain boomerang (oh how i hate him) or slipknot at all. i wanted to like captain boomerang i really did he is the first Australian character I've seen in this type of film. but he gets no explanation at all. he carries this pink unicorn for unknown reasons and is just a dick every moment he's on screen. as for slip not he really doesn't get enough screen time. he seems a likable character he's just not exposed enough. enchantress/June moon plays a big part in the movie she is creepy as hell and it works you end up hating one half of her (for the right reasons) and loving the other. as for Amanda Waller. she is played really really well i won't spoiler her but all i can say is prepare for a ride with twists and turns. (i'll mention the joker later) 2. THE CGI. This seems to be a sore point that sits at the core of a lot of the bad reviews and as I've mentioned this is one area where i hold some expertise. For the most part it's fine certainly miles better then ghostbusters and batman vs superman. there are times where they have used cgi where they really didn't need to. some parts of enchantress's scenes for example they have replaced the actress with a cgi body double which is really unnecessary for the actions being performed which leads to unnatural motions and twitches of her body. i get that shes a extra dimensional being but it just doesn't flow right. that said the average viewer is probably not going to notice too much and it doesn't take away from the enjoy-ability of the film. the rest of the cgi is barely noticeable unless you know what your looking for with a few mild exceptions i won't mention because that would be a spoiler.3. THE EDITING/MUSIC. another point at the heart of the bad reviews and again a area i hold some experience. the music is over used i have to agree with the negative reviews on that. it's used in places it shouldn't be so when it's used where its meant to be it loses it's impact. if the characters where not well acted and fleshed out this would potential ruin the experience luckily the actors performances and the writing compensate for the lost impact of the music you still feel the emotion your meant to feel. as for the editing. it's no where near as bad as the bad reviews say. there are some problems with it it's evident that there has been interference with the directors vision but it does not really detract from the experience of the film. the use of flash backs mirrors to a extent the methodology of deadpool and it's used to great effect. over all the film is not ruined by these points as the bad reviews say. in fact unless you know something about editing and the use of music to create emotion you probably won't notice any issues at all.4.The joker. i went into this fully expecting to hate the way the character was portrayed. heath ledger to me was the ultimate joker and I've been looking at images for months now hating the look and wondering if this was going to be a terrible portrayal. i have to say though i was proved wrong Jarrod letto plays the joker extremely well. the character is exactly as twisted and dark has he needs to be. his infamous twisted sense of humour is touched upon but not really explored but considering he is only on screen for about 15 minuets that's to be expected. we will see more of him in the future i'm sure and we will see more of his twisted dark persona.5.Harley and jokers relationship. I've seen a lot of complaints that the relationship is portrayed as a abusive one and that's kind of the point. the relationship between these two characters is really abusive in the comics. you could describe Harley as having Stockholm syndrome. she does. the relationship is this mad twisted almost captor and hostage relationship. Harley loves this evil freak and your caught in the middle you want to see her out of that relationship but at the same time her love for him is so strong you feel sad for her when shes missing him.over all it's a incredibly well done film sure it has flaws but what film doesn't go into this film with a open mind and you will absolutely love this roller coaster of a film",Suicide Squad
1981,cowboymattias,"A mix of the good, the bad and the awesome.",8,16 August 2016,"Every DC superhero movie is under an extreme amount of pressure to deliver a performance equaling or surpassing TDK. Mainly because they all take it upon themselves to bring us the gritty reality that is our world only with the superhuman in it. Suicide Squad however gives that vision the finger and runs along its own path. Or so I hoped. Just like deadpool it goes crazy. From the first release of the teaser trailer (how good was that thing btw?) it promised fun and explosions without worrying too much about realism. We heard crazy tales of Letto and the crew and the visuals kept on getting fresher and fresher. Why oh why did they not send the memo to Viola Davis? Her portrayal of Amanda Waller seems to be the exact opposite of what the rest is doing. There is no fun when she is on screen. Every time the squad gets the funtrain going, she either derails it with insanely long introductions of the squad (who needs to hear her say 4 times that she wants to form a team of the most dangerous people in the world?) or she sucks the fun out of an otherwise ass-cracking situation. Overall I liked the movie a lot. Truth be told, the story's a joke, the villains do not impose a sense of threat and the moments of apologetic 'it's not just about violence, there's a reason for everything' are probably counterproductive. But past that, there is a true gem of a movie. The relationship between Joker and Quinn is the most tangible relationship in a movie in recent years. Harley Quinn is epic and insane, exactly what you wanted without knowing it. Will Smith delivers a solid Deadshot when he is not fussing over his daughter. And DC even manages to get the right angle on the humor at times. It brings colour to an otherwise bleak DC universe. One last point I would like to mention is how feminist Harley Quinn is. She devours men, does her own thing, beats bad guys to a pulp. She is fearless enough to go into a gunfight wearing nothing but a sweatshirt, hotpants and a baseball bat. And the reason that drives her? Getting to her Puddin'. So in conclusion, this was a movie very much worth a view. It has extremely high highs and some deep lows. During those I suggest you just close your eyes, the soundtrack will numb your pain.",Suicide Squad
1982,rs-firefields,Barely a Movie,4,18 August 2016,"I'd give this a few stars because the acting was good, the graphics were fantastic and the camera work was beautiful. But where was the story?A group of misfit villains make interesting characters, but we got no character development. Having them in a squad is pointless with no relationship development and if you're going to make us sit for over two hours then you should have more than a tiny unsatisfying story arc. I can count the amount of actual scenes on one finger. Five minutes of development makes the conclusion of this movie was frustrating. Without us caring at all about these characters and their relationships why would we care about a conclusion. This easily fits into my worst movies ever made list.

Now as someone who is not a die had comic book reader, as an average person who enjoys good movies, I know what's good to me, what I watched, I really enjoyed this movie. It just grabbed my attention from the very beginning to the very end. I didn't want to close my eyes, didn't want to miss anything. I laughed at the jokes, I was at the edge of my seat when it got intense, and I wanted to know more. Harley Quinn and the Joker were one of my favorite parts of the story. I would just watch the movie, give it a shot and see for yourself if you love or hate the movie. I never listen to anybody's opinion when it comes to movies, food, or books, we all have different likes and dislikes, I don't expect to let anyone make that decision for me.",Suicide Squad
1986,marcagnasr,Disappointing at best,4,7 August 2016,"I was REALLY looking forward to this film despite the trend of awful movies DC keeps pushing out into theaters. I really thought they may redeem themselves with this film but that is far from the case. The story is terrible. Walking out of the theater I am left pondering a million different ways the story could have gone. Millions of questions like ""why didn't they just do this..."" or ""why did they have to bother doing that....?"" It was a VERY weak story that wasn't all that interesting. But what really REALLY killed the movie for me personally was how choppy the whole thing felt. There were scenes that honestly felt like the editing team was just like ""lets just put this scene right here cause its already been filmed... so yeah... why not."" The fights were poorly shot and didn't really pull me in. I NEVER look at the time when watching a movie, but this film had me checking my watch every 15 minutes wondering how much longer it was going to go. The continuity from scene to scene was terrible, moments in the film that one would think should matter were underplayed, and moments in the film that had no build up were then tried to be made important with slow motion or a certain score that just didn't fit. Some of the scripting was just so beyond horrible that sitting in that movie theater seat was tormenting. Seriously, I was so angry walking out of that theater! I really wanted this movie to be amazing and it was easily one of the worst films I'd seen in a long time. (maybe my expectations were too high...)Some good notes: the actors tried their best, or at least I want to pretend that they did. Some of the jokes were actually funny even though they were interjected at the most random of moments (not all the time of course). The jokes helped alleviate some of the building depression that I was feeling from how awful a movie this was. And the first 30 minutes of back story to the villains were interesting. So I'll give it 4 out of 10 on those points and I'm being generous. Needless to say, I don't recommend this movie. I don't recommend watching it at full price in theaters. And I honestly think DC needs to get their act together or just stick to comic books.",Suicide Squad

I really cannot see why this movie has received a lot of bash. I went to this movie in order to be entertained, and I was thoroughly entertained! The characters were great, as were the actors, I enjoyed the story a lot. I am a big fan of the Suicide Squad comics and I think the movie has done a great job at putting my favourite comic book characters onto the big screen. Personally, I would recommend everyone to ignore the reviews, including my own, and go out with some mates to see this movie and see what you think.

This movie just in perfect time for USA 2016. Bad People aren't Bad People someday and it's good to break the rules sometime *winkx*Really good movie, but rushed. If they had maybe extra 30 minutes! It was good but in my opinion I think the trailers were better. The thing is that the plot was good, the characters were so cool, but there was one thing that made the movie sink a little: they rushed it. There was no character development, except for Deadshot, Sergeant Flag and Harley. The others were like sidekicks and didn't get enough screen time. The movie felt like it was mainly about those three, thinking it's about a GROUP.Harley's character wasn't butchered. It was really fine the way they presented it, she wasn't just ""objectified"" she was more complex, I would say just as complex as her comic counterpart, she was someone who was taken advantage of and I believe they all they did very well!!But although, It's like getting the reason of my life back again after all the movies I've ever watched in my 21 years.

LOL Enchantress was the worst of it all. Her belly dancing through the movie was so cheap and just stupid. Not a cool or impressive villain AT ALL. Cara definitely didn't own that part what so ever.The whole movie is basically Will Smith's story about him and his daughter, blah blah blah and annoying Margot Robbie.I had to immediately go home and watch Avengers just so I can watch a GOOD Comic Book movie. A good action movie is supposed to blow your mind and be like, ""I didn't expect that coming!"" Well...not one time did I think ""That was a cool scene"".

Big mistake.All the main characters of the squad (that were in jail) are meticulously described in the first part of the movie, it's so boring you can't wait for all of them to be introduced, after that you expect them to be the only people joining the team, but then two other characters appear out of nowhere, with a 5 seconds introduction each, they are combating the same monsters and part of the same squad but apparently not as important... It's nonsense.That's just one small thing that really annoyed me at first but then everything else was bad.If you know the series Power Rangers... That is the Spoiler right there. The fighting moves and the enemies were just as stupid. There was so much kicking and punching you question the ""power"" of the witch that released them.I could go on and on about all the things I didn't like about this movie, which would include the TERRIBLY thought out plot, HORRIBLE acting from ""the joker"" and POOR dialogues.This is not a movie to watch, don't do this to yourself.",Suicide Squad

There are 2 weak points, that I 100% agree with: the super villain is strong and powerful and could destroy the Earth in 2 seconds, and the way the ""heroes"" solve this problem is kind of... uh-mm... hard to believe. Secondly, the main reason that makes the Suicide Squad team united and obedient is also really hard to believe, they could have done a better job on how the government would control them. However, Jared Leto is looking amazing as the Joker. He is not the main character, thus his appearances are small, but I really enjoyed him. He is a modern Joker who, let's say, in his own way, cares about Harley Quinn. Needless to say that Deadshot and Harley Quinn are looking incredible and how the production design is stunning and HQ-ish. Go check this movie in the cinemas, it is worth it!",Suicide Squad

People going into this with that mindset might be disappointed. I know this was more based off the 2011 Suicide Squad comics which I don't mind. I found it odd Deadshot got the spotlight as more of a ""main character"" type. It was something I could dislike easily because she's usually quiet and menacing in the background. Will Smith ended up playing a great Deadshot. As much as I love Harley, Joker steals the show. I love the classic cartoon Joker and he played it brilliantly.Note 8",Suicide Squad

Casting was awesome and scenes were beautiful but story was a bit disappointing. I think after BVS and Suicide Squad, WB and DC comics should take the stories and directors seriously. DC should not just show immense power from superheroes, fans also want to see intellectuality from their heroes. I think they should hire CHRISTOPHER NOLAN or DEL TORO for their next films(especially Justice League) if they don't want their extended universe to be blown away. All Batman movies from Nolan were rated awesome and the joker created by him was awesome. He got the story in the right direction in the sequels. I would love to see their work.

Harley Quinn's character got really old, really fast. Deadshot was boring and had no purpose. Rick Flag and Enchantress? Completlely awful.

2004,camilla-kp,Great and entertaining.,8,14 August 2016,"For starters I was super hyped about this movie coming out. I have been waiting the past year to see it. Pretty much every one is disappointed in some way, but I'd say it is one of the better. If you compare it to Jason Bourne, which shows everything exciting happening in the trailer, Suicide Squad were better. I did totally not see the witch trying to take over the world coming. In the trailer it was more like ""The bad guys, trying to save the world for whatever is threatening them"" However, all in all a good movie for those who aren't the most critic people in the world. The reviews haven't been all good, there is off course some things you are left to wonder about, but a good movie despite its flaws. The movie is not all serious, there are some great humor in it, and some great laughs. I even ended up feeling a little sorry for Harley. Cara Delevingne, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Will Smith and all the other actors/actresses did a great job, I was surprised by how good Cara could play the evil witch, I did not see that coming, as the trailer didn't reveal much of the content of the movie. It is definitely worth a watch, it is great and entertaining. If you like things blowing up, and great humor, here is a movie for you.",Suicide Squad

There is no story line to follow at all. The movie is a collection of characters who do not fit with each other. The Joker makes no sense in the movie, it feels like they wanted to introduce a bunch new characters for the future and decided and decided; let throw all of them to one set and see what will happen. I am sure they will build on some of the characters in the future. But as for now, if you want story line; look somewhere else, if you like shallow action movies this might be just about right.",Suicide Squad
2006,bartekcebula,"A lot of potential, minimal effort.",3,4 December 2016,"This movie was B-A-D. Now before you get all teary eyed and emotional, keep in mind that i'm judging this as I would any movie and not just a super hero movie. The movie has way too many problems to even fit into this sub 1000 word review but I'll do may best. First of all holy crap this movie is dark. And no, I don't mean this in a literary way. The movie physically looks really dark. When watching it on my computer I found myself trying to turn up the brightness on my monitor even after it was maxed out. Secondly, you can say goodbye to character development. I'm not surprised that this aspect of the movie was completely butchered as it would be impossible to develop so many characters in a two hour movie. Therefore it doesn't make sense that they would try in the first place. They fell short and it's very obvious while watching the movie. The movie has no real soundtrack. The music for the movie is a huge combination of singles, some written with the movie in mind, some not. While this might appeal to some people, personally I thought it was lazy and I would have liked an original score. Speaking of originality, well... there was none. The ""plot"" was a ""save all of humanity"" type of plot which literally made me role my eyes a couple of times. Quite honestly I wish they had gone with a simpler and maybe grittier plot over this blown out and lazy piece of crap that they came up with. It just made me feel bored. That's it, the movie is filled with hundreds of one liners that fall short every time and make you question whether or not the script was written by a 14 year old and many of the elements in the movie will have your eyes spinning. I just felt bored. It's a shame, there was sooo much potential in this story. Unfortunately it was squandered.",Suicide Squad
2007,hallo-ev,"Really, really bad",1,8 August 2016,"It's a crushing feeling you have when your most anticipated movie of the year ends up sucking. I don't even know where to start. Suicide Squad is not good at all. It's bad. It's very, very bad. So, so messy. I guess I could start with the performances and characters.Margot Robbie was as perfect as you can get with Harley Quinn and she also had the most interesting backstory, but that's a credit to the creators of the character, not the film. I was a fan of her casting from the moment it was announced. Jai Courtney was surprisingly good as Captain Boomerang. Unfortunately, he was given nothing to work with, aside from being funny sometimes. Nobody else was given anything either. Will Smith played Will Smith in a Deadshot costume and he was given some backstory, but it was the regular 'dad-wanting-to-do-right-by-his- daughter' type stuff. El Diablo had the second-most interesting backstory and character. Notice how I keep saying ""backstory."" This is because that's all it is -- simple characterization. No development for anybody. Every other team member is completely disposable, and one is actually disposed of very early on. Killer Croc was given nothing other than really great makeup. Katana had a dead husband, which is referenced for about 30 seconds. She also randomly shows up out of nowhere, even after all the important characters have been established. Same goes for Slipknot who is brought out of a car and placed in the team out of nowhere with zero previous acknowledgment (he's the one who gets disposed of very early and nobody cares). And I almost forgot Joel Kinnaman's Rick Flag, who is a clichéd G.I. Joe soldier with a heavy southern accent. He is romantically involved with Enchantress, the villain, to help create some drama. The standout was easily Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. She was impeccably casted and nailed the character. The fact that she was the reason for everything made it that much more ironic and perfect.Oh, and Jared Leto as the Joker is in the movie too.The story is uh, well Enchantress is some ancient being and witch with weak motivation who wants to take over the world or something. She resurrects her brother to act as the secondary villain and muscle while she dances awkwardly. For most of the action, the team fight a bunch of faceless henchmen. Amanda Waller is also manipulative and bad, sort of. For a while you think they're mission is to stop Enchantress, even though it's never said and I guess the team doesn't care that they don't know what they're doing. Then it's revealed that they were rescuing Waller the whole time and everyone is mad for reasons I don't understand. Then they have to go stop Enchatress and her big brother (btw these two are worthy of being in the top 5 worst comic book movie villains list). Also the Joker is in the movie as well for some reason. He is trying to rescue Harley Quinn from the team, but when he gets her in the helicopter, it is quickly brought down and explodes and he dies but not really (obviously).The editing and pacing are also god awful. From the get-go I could tell the movie was going to be rushed and underdeveloped (which are the main problems with Batman v Superman, coincidentally). It starts with Amanda Waller sitting at a dinner table with some guys as she explains the characters to the audience as flashbacks are shown, because we don't have time for them to be introduced on their own throughout the film. The editing for these flashbacks are horrific, as well. The editing was also choppy throughout the whole film, which is probably because of all the extensive reshoots that apparently took place. But I also have a feeling that there are many, many deleted scenes (just like Batman v Superman), because so much felt left out. The soundtrack was weird. I like the individual songs they used and it was admittedly nice to hear Seven Nation Army, Black Skinhead, Sympathy For The Devil, and Bohemian Rhapsody. But they felt out of place and crammed in many scenes, just to make the movie more quirky and lighthearted.In conclusion, I was mildly entertained whenever there was some kind of characterization, such as the scene in the bar. That was probably the only scene I liked. Some moments were good (such as whenever Margot Robbie walked away from the camera), but the only full scene I liked was that one. I enjoyed Margot Robbie's, Viola Davis', and, unbelievably, Jai Courtney's performances. In terms of filmmaking, it is nothing short of a DISASTER. My guess is the studio held test screenings, and people thought it wasn't funny and too dark. So the studio scrambled to add in music that didn't fit to make it quirky, and sent all the footage through a wood chipper, ruining everything trying to find the balance of light and dark. Such an enormous shame. 3.5/10",Suicide Squad

2009,nathantj1985,Suicide Squad? Wait none of them did that...,1,4 December 2018,"So hearing good and bad perspectives about this movie I finally decided to watch it, my hesitation finally leaving me. While there was great potential initially for this to be a first of its kind for villains saving the day, it just wasn't great or good overall. Not sure why Warner Bros still hasn't hit the DC Universe successfully like Marvel has- no one really stirring the ship I suppose. Characters were lacking and script seems campy at times. I see why Deadshot got more screen time- top paid actor, at least he is good at math like his daughter. Math is everything. That's how you cap a fool yo! Joker was just bad, his laugh was the only Joker-esk quality about him and it was overkill. Jared Leto is a creep in real life, maybe he should have played himself more. Harley Quinn's accent sounded bad, so so many quips, we get it you're cray cray girl- drink that espresso! Enchantress had an awesome transformation from Dr. June into the ""witch"" at first in the meeting with the token military advisers, yet after that the CGI was just too bad of quality and too much especially at the end fight seen. Also her voice didn't sync well, it reminded me of the Gatekeeper in the Ghostbusters scenes, just kind of funny. Didn't some director come in last minute to heighten color on some of the scenes? That trick or ""name drop"" (search and you will find him) didn't work. Katana just shows up to help, the references about her husband's trapped soul in her katana is talked about way too much, once was a enough, twice was just bad writing, we get it she has emotional stuff to work out. Oh wait they all do. El Diablo almost seemed like a stereotypically racist character- I'm still not sure how I feel about that, what is this a Michael Bay racist Transformer idea? Why though... And Killer Croc should have gotten more kills, his overall design was too humanoid not enough Croc in my opinion. Slipknot was expendable like some of Deadpool's X-Force Team, hold on, weren't the Suicide Squad refered too as Force X by Amanda Waller? Mind explode, POW! Overall this movie just wasn't as great as it could have been. It was too AA meeting for me, oh duh that happened, although the villains didn't hold hands and say a prayer after they had a drink, at least they had a drink. Oh yeah, my thought came back like Captain Boomerangs lame boomerang he threw near the end of the movie to spy on the Enchantress with his Samsung phone. Good placement add, can't wait to buy a Samsung phone, but wouldn't that cloud of electric magic-ultimate-weapon Enchantress was channeling cancel any satellite reception? Nevermind, they killed the satellite later. Oh that makes sense as well as the three ring binder of top secret info on villains, hero's or the whole story plot, because Batman isn't good with computers at all. Either is a top secret government that's why they kill their IT people, dang crappy universe to live in. At least unicorn stuff animals are in and beers that appear out of no where, that's right Captain Boomerrang, what else you got in that jacket you magician you.",Suicide Squad
2010,dani-dettori,It's a mess!,4,8 August 2016,I thought the movie would be in the style of Christopher Nolan's Batman and we would see real villains but the movie is just a mess and doesn't make sense at all. Some of the things I noticed in this movie:1. How many helicopter crashes are there in this movie ??? I think everybody experienced a helicopter crash some even 2 :)! Oh and they all miraculously survive every crash... 2. Whole city is evacuated in a couple of hours and you don't see any civilians walking the streets?3. Where is Batman? It's the end of the world and what do these villains have that a normal soldier wouldn't have? Except maybe diablo. 4. Amanda Waller = mess5. Enchantress = real funny especially her dance moves! 6.

2011,kimenguman,"Not ""Suicide Squad"" but ""Deadshot"" !",6,12 August 2016,"I think Suicide Squad is not a bad movie but it's just not a good movie. The movie is entitled ""Suicide Squad"" while it must be ""Deadshot"". After 20 minutes watching the movie I was fed up by watching Will Smith playing only what Will Smith can play. It was as the movie was written by him and for him. You're not watching Suicide Squad you're watching a photo shooting of Will Smith in a cosplay of Deadshot. Margot Robbie is a good actress and I find her well chosen for Harley Queen but HQ is my favorite character from all comics and here, she's sexy but not mad : she's just trying to be mad without success. The story is really insipid ... all the money was spent for the actors and it remains no money for the scenario ? For the next one, send me an email and I'll give you a free scenario hundred times better. The bad guys have been replaced by Care Bears. And is someone able to tell me why the Joker have been replaced by an ersatz of Maryline Manson ?

2012,mcrichardson17,A lot of potential but not quite there yet,6,5 August 2016,Overall this move wasn't my cup of tea. I'm a fan of DC movies (marvel is winning right now) and I can wait for the Wonder Woman movie to come out on DC but this movie didn't fit the bill. The characters were underdeveloped which led to a lack of compassion and compelling moments. Most scenes and overall story line felt rushed and there was no time to learn or understand the characters. The story line was also predictive and stale. I will say that both Harley Quinn and Deadshot were amazing although there was not much time available for the other squad members. To me this felt like a push to help develop the justice league movie but we'll see.,Suicide Squad
2013,deathshot95,Simply Amazing...,10,4 August 2016,"To start out, I do not know too much about the Suicide Squad except from what I saw from Arrow... and the first trailer... I came into the movie knowing about the low scores but it looked interesting so here we go... The movie was very well paced and the cast chemistry could be seen. There are moments of laughter, moments of action, and even moments of silence just listening to the characters talk to one another. It has quick witted and some twisted humor which I love. Harley Quinn takes front and center along side Deadshot. The leadership is shown and emotions that the squad didn't know were there are shown. Even though, they still had their evil tendencies. The characters are all innocent in their own ways which adds to the attachment you make quickly. Somethings are not explained with some of the characters however, but it does not detract from the plot. The ""professional"" critics seemed to have missed the movie and were to busy to enjoy it. This is one of my all-time favorite movies now.",Suicide Squad
2014,Farhan-singawinata,A Fair One.,7,12 August 2016,"Okay, first of all i am a big comic book fan. I know very well that most of Suicide Squad operations are Amanda Waller's Covert Operations. This movie is no way near a covert operation. The plot was so messed up, that the conflict in the movie came from the squad itself. They did the same thing as they did with Batman Vs Superman. There were just too many sub-Plots that shouldn't be there, or may be they should, but just a minor reference like only Verbally. I'm talking about each Characters' backgrounds. Guardians Of The Galaxy did a very good job on telling each of the members backgrounds.On top of that, the Actors performance are great. Will Smith did a fine job portraying Deadshot ( even though it was more like Will Smith being Will Smith. I mean, Where is the Cold-blooded super talented Assassin?). And Margot Robbie's performance was excellent, a perfect combination of both hot and crazy. well Captain Boomerang did a well job on making the squad a bit more less-tensed, it was a humorous performance from Jai Courtney. Other than those three, i would say other roles were just didn't quite have an enough screen time, especially The Joker and of course Slipknot ( What a waste of a good character). Don't get me wrong, Jared has always been a great actor. He went to see criminals and Psycho killers for this role. But, yeah Joker isn't actually a part of the squad. And his presence in this movie was forced. He didn't need to be in the movie. But, he killed it. He is the perfect guy to portray The Joker, beside Heath though. Well, I still enjoyed the movie though. The Soundtracks are good, and they rhyme well with the squad. The problem of the DC Cinematic Universe is that the plots are so messed up. It's like they handed you lots of scramble words and you need to put them together yourself and it confused you. They need to lighten up the plots.6 Stars for The Plot and 8 Stars For The Actors, so it's 7 stars overall!!. But, hey i'd rather watch ""Batman: Assault On Arkham "" instead.",Suicide Squad
2015,naruto-rathod,Absolutely Unique!!,10,7 August 2016,"As a Marvel fan, I was shocked by how enjoyable this movie was however, there were some unexplained parts SPOILER ----->(i.e Amanda Waller shooting all the cops inside her office O.o). Most the characters were very amazing as well (deadshot was absolutely brilliant!); Jared has a different style then compared to Chris Hemsworth, which is more dark. I think this movie is much more like Deadpool but with more appropriate jokes. However, the villain was absolutely boring and should have been replaced with a better villain. I hope Marvel's movie, Dr. Strange is as good as this movie. This movie is totally under-rated by people. This movie is very hilarious and likable.",Suicide Squad
2016,cyrielle-ben,botched,4,3 August 2016,"A few hours after the ""heroes"" meet, their complete personality change. Their dynamics change. Also most of the dialogue is chit chat bullshit.Full of illogical scenes, and stupid story line. Also very brutal at the beginning, but not having read those particular comics, I can not judge on that original backstory.Fight/action scenes were badly filmed. Some actors were completely useless in the main story and had idiotic punchline or purpose.Went to see it with my 17 yo sister, and she loved it although she agrees with me that many many scenes didn't make any sense.Looking forward to reading what other people think of this movie.Overall : pretty good movie. The Joker could be crazier tbh.A 25yo French woman.",Suicide Squad
2017,nitun007,Offbeat story with entrancing performance.(Spoiler free review),8,6 August 2016,"I watched the so hyped 'Suicide Squad' today and man oh man, it is absolutely ravishing. From the very first scene till the credits rolled, the movie was a roller coaster of uber action, emotions and amazing character transformations. The comic book based flick had loads of pressure of delivering and living up to the expectations of crazy fans and indifferent critics. However, It was not able to suffice the latter, for which nobody is to be blamed. Apparently rotten tomatoes doesn't hate DC as their ratings come from aggregation of reviews from various newspaper and websites. The fact might not be digestible because that would suggest that media, as a whole, intricately is somehow disagreeing with the work of DC. But that all might just change with the launch of this offbeat cinematic story of Bad vs Evil. The story is pretty simple to fathom. Since always lurking evil finds a new way to rise in Midway city (centered in BVS timeline), mean Amanda Waller, brilliantly played by Viola Davis, who is a high government official takes up the herculean task of creating a team of maniacs, cons and metahumans to hit evil back to the ground. The character execution by Will Smith, Margot Robbie and fellow actors will seriously convince you to sit tight till the very end. Joker, played by the Oscar winner Jared Leto, goes hand in hand with her on screen love interest Harley Quinn, to which Margot Robbie has done justice to. Their chemistry is off the hook. There were few scenes which slowed the execution of the movie (first few scenes from the second half) but it picked up the pace gradually. The mix of comedy and despair can be scene when Captain Boomerang(Jai Courtney) and Deadshot(Will Smith) get screen time. All things considered this movie can mark the work of David Ayer (Director) in History, when in the first time ever Antiheroes take the stand as Protagonist to ward off evil from the face of the earth. At the end of the day DC can finally take a sigh of relief as Suicide Squad puts them back on the map.",Suicide Squad
2018,joaopedro-jpct,It was a good movie despite the flaws,1,6 August 2016,"As soon as the movie ended I became pleased about the overall of the movie. I'm only gonna spoil at the end of this review with pros and cons, so feel free to skip the pros and cons! I've read that Warner Bros. had 2 versions of Suicide Squad, a darker tone from David Ayer and a lighter tone from the studio. They decided that the best thing to do would be to merge the two versions together. The result? It was OK but not that OK. In my opinion, I believe that you can only choose one version when editing the movie. You either make it softer and lighter or you make it brutal and darker, (the one I wanted). I wanted it to be just brutal, dark and serious because that's what I recall from the Suicide Squad Comic-Con Trailer (2015). The problem of the movie was not just that. They put a lot of characters in just one movie. That's not bad for me, because I'm a DC/Marvel comic-book reader, but for others who have little or no knowledge about the DC Characters. The movie, for me (as a fan of DC/Marvel/Superhero Stories), was fantastic (despite some flaws) but for someone who is trying to enter into the superhero's universe of DC is HARD since they will question during the movie ""Who is that? , why is he/she there?"" and etc. And for them the story might have been boring.Here are my Pros and ConsPros: - Some humor moments - Good Character Interpretations - Awesome Action ScenesConsMoments where the story was irrelevant and uninteresting - The villain",Suicide Squad
2019,mar_jusi,"Great movie, don't read bad stuff, for me best superhero movie until today!",7,7 August 2016,I was hoping so bad that this movie would be great and it was. I am not one of the stupid fanboys who thinks everything that dc or marvel makes is excellent. I like DC so i was looking forward for the DC universe. I liked BvS but it could be better for the name it promised. I didn't think there would be so many haters about DC and I thought DC fans Created this opinion that there are people who hate DC and don't look the movies for what they are but after the reviews for this movie I think that there are. IT IS AMAZING AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN EXPECT FOR THIS KIND OF MOVIE. I am really looking forward for the Joker to. I didn't want this to be a long review so i am just telling you go watch it for yourself!,Suicide Squad
2020,nikolinabb4,This movie is fun!,8,14 August 2016,"I had to write this review, because I'm one of those people who actually read the reviews before deciding to watch the movie. Fortunately, based on one favorable review from a respected Croatian critic (who simply and correctly called the movie ""fun"") I decided to see it and was pleasantly surprised. Frankly, I'm baffled by the scathing reviews this movie got. Suicide Squad is definitely NOT, as Christopher Orr from the Atlantic (one of my favorite critics) called it, ""the worst of the worst"". It's actually pretty good and I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 in comparison to other superhero movies. In my opinion, Deadpool, the last Captain America and Ant-Man are better movies. Iron Man (especially the awful third part), Thor and The Avengers are not. I should probably mention that I'm not a fan of superhero movies, I watch them because I watch all movies regardless of the genre. Also, I couldn't care less about the whole Marvel vs DC Comics issue. A superhero movie should be entertaining and this movie definitely delivers on entertainment. Moreover, it has the best and the most original female character I've ever seen in a superhero movie: Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie is simply spectacular, her cute voice combined with psychotic stare and obvious deadliness are a must see. If there was nothing else good about this movie, her performance alone would be reason enough to see it. The rest of the cast were also great, especially Will Smith who was very convincing in his role of Deadshot (morally ambiguous, but still relatable). Most critics called the plot ""a mess"". I disagree yet again. The plot is solid and easy to follow. There are a lot of characters introduced, but you never lose track of them. One of the weak points of the movie is definitely Joker, who remained somewhat sketchy and most likely fell victim to vigorous editing. The main weakness, however, is probably the character of Enchantress who is neither formidable nor especially convincing. Having said that, I should probably add that a scary villain was not what the movie was focused on, because the heroes are the true villains. The classic villain is almost irrelevant in a movie whose whole premise is the question of bad guys doing good under the right circumstances. To sum up, if you're looking for a fun summer movie, go and see Suicide Squad, you won't be disappointed!",Suicide Squad
2021,digmani,The best part was Ben Affleck.,7,6 August 2016,"I really liked how Batman didn't appeared much. It would be dangerous to see more of Ben Affleck, he's really a bad actor. Its kinda cool when he appears with a mask and i don't have to see his ugly face. So I think that the movie was OK. I don't hate him and i don't love him. I think that the people who comment that didn't like the movie will propably see a SuiCide Squad 2 because the people are stupid and like to complain. I'm complainning too but I'm right. It's because of those people that movies like that and like Batman vs Superman have a huge audience. But its OK. I really didn't understood the meaning of the last part of the movie when Bruce Wayne talks with Viola Davis. Its a good movie to be forgotten. The popcorns were delicious by the way.",Suicide Squad
2022,saad-xia,The critics are the ones who haven't watched the movie.,10,4 August 2016,"Hey! I Just watched Suicide Squad last night, and I am a huge fan of the comics. Now since I have read almost every single comic of Suicide Squad I know for a fact that The Joker didn't have much of a role in these comics hence it is justified that Jared leto's role as the joker wasn't the main role, it was more of a side story line in the movie. Which is the thing I love the most about this movie. The direction was amazing, the way deadshot shoots off all the enchantress's companions while standing on the car. I always wanted to see that scene. Harley quinn's human side overlapping her sociopath side especially the scene where the Joker actually drops her off the helicopter just so that she survives and the way she fakes her craziness after that was amazing. Di Abalo was surprisingly so good SOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD literally the best character David Ayer could ever get for the movie. He did a great job carrying up his past and accepting the fact he killed his family and how this will help him make things right. Katana origins weren't changed and a very smart thing to do. Deadshot and his daughter's relationship was beautiful. Amanda waller that mean bi*ch was completely in her act a very good job done. Its a 10/10 from me since the direction and the script of such movies is really tough to bring out and David ayer was able to do that. He did a great job to show the origins of the whole squad and relate it to the present. Amazing job done. !!! Ironic Im going to the cinemas again to watch it lol. You guys should watch it and let critics bark coz they are best at it. Best of luck.",Suicide Squad
2023,SharpenedGrassBlades,Above average Summer Fun Flick,8,7 August 2016,"As far as super hero flicks go, this film did not reach the high water mark of the Defenders of the Galaxy, however it did not flop around for 2hrs in cringe worthy fashion like some super hero flicks (an example here would be fantastic 4). What you may enjoy in this film: really fun performances from Robbie, Leto, Kinnaman, and even Smith (I was able to suspend my disbelief and view Smith as his character most, but not all of the time); lots of action, fun interactions between the ""evil ensemble"". For me, the highlight was Leto as the joker, he was absolutely fantastic.What you probably won't like: somewhat choppy editing and a weak plot. What drives the characters from scene to scene in the second and third act is anyone's guess. Perhaps they felt a need to get to the end of the movie. The bad guys are there just for the good guys (who are also technically bad I guess) to beat up and kill. More needed to be done to develop the enemy in general and in turn, the conflict between the protagonists and antagonists. As a non-comic aficionado I perhaps had lower expectations going in (plus I had read a couple bad reviews). However, in the end, I definitely had a good time seeing this in the theater and would recommend it to anyone wanting a fun summer flick.",Suicide Squad
2024,hpro064,not disappointed at all !!,8,6 August 2016,"i really liked the movie , its chaotic mess as it should be , you cant have characters like harley joker captain boomerang deadshot and make a serious type movie . robbie really nailed it i don't know if jared did a grreat job , as heath already has set the bar too high , but i wasn't disappointed i enjoyed. now some people are complaining that the script/plot wasn't too good , i would say it was good not excellent but good as it was the origin story type or their introduction movie you cant go too deep into the script , half of the crowd wouldn't even understand what would be going on. the rest of cast also did good amanda deadshot were really good to watch . i would suggest you go watch the movie its really fun you wont be disappointed at all",Suicide Squad
2025,navinpraveen93,SKWAD:review by a dc comics fan(no spoilers),8,8 August 2016,"I have known suicide squad long before the big screen debut news was out.I really appreciate director David Ayer for preserving the core values of suicide squad while giving it a personnel touch. This movie very well serve as a continuum to upcoming dc movies. Talking about the story it's pretty formulaic it's good versus bad, but what makes it different is here good ones are actually the bad guys. High octane action sequence, along with power packed performance from a magnificent cast sets this movie apart from other super hero movies.When someone like Ayer is behind the camera, and a team lead by Will Smith,Margot,Viola alongside Jared Leto as clown prince himself.Its a great moment to watch them on screen. Special mention to members of the squad Joel,Cara,Adewale,Jai,Jay,Adam,and Karen(big screen debut)",Suicide Squad
2026,thebestravi,Total waste of actors and characters.,1,6 August 2016,"When big budget movies are made, with stars like Jared Leto and Will Smith; playing characters like Deadshot and Joker, the bar is set too high. And the movie fails at the first step, they have made a movie which basically consists of trailers for all the characters, which may be used in the future. There story seems like a child playing with his action figures making them fight one another. They have lacked in motivation for every character to form the squad.DC, Nolan has raised standards of Batman and Joker, I am not telling you to top that but at least do not destroy the franchise. Suicide Squad is a new low after major hiccups in B v S.",Suicide Squad

It is well worth checking out on the big screen and is right up there as one of my favorite movies for the whole year so far.A fantastic cast, lighthearted tone, and fun soundtrack make Suicide Squad one of the most entertaining films of 2016.""Writer-director David Ayer (End of Watch) skillfully sets up the film, introducing each of the crazies with caffeinated comic-book energy,"" wrote Chris Nashawaty for Entertainment Weekly.""For DC, which blew it with Batman v Superman last spring, Suicide Squad is a small step forward.

2028,kshizzle000,The greatest DC film since The Dark Knight Rises,10,2 August 2016,"It's just so amazing. Harley, the Joker, Deadshot, the Enchantress...it's all just so spectacular. The chemistry between the whole Suicide Squad is uncannily amazing. Nearly everything about the movie is absolutely perfect. A fanboy's dream come true. Now don't get me wrong, there are a few things wrong with the movie (Joker's screen time and the pacing of the movie, mostly), but it's just not enough to bring the rating down to a 9. The movie is so much fun even without sacrificing the dark tone that it has. It definitely pushes the PG-13 rating that it has to the absolute limit. Overall, just an amazing film. Definitely recommend it, especially if you liked Guardians of the Galaxy, Batman v Superman, and The Dark Knight.",Suicide Squad
2029,luigi53789,Good movie with only one major disappointment,7,4 August 2016,"Overall, I think it was a good movie. Could it have been better? Yes. Does it deserve the critic hate on rotten tomatoes? No. For the most part all the characters played their parts well. Harley Quinn was particularly exceptional. Deadshot's personality was nearly spot on as well. Unlike Batman v Superman this movie has some comical moments, so it's not always shrouded in doom and gloom. They pulled it off good, making it more like a comic book without making the fights feel too unreal to be able to get into them. The only real letdown was the Joker. I personally thought he lacked luster and his character was not portrayed well. He was less psychotic and was more of a crime lord. Instead of being a careless psychopath that gets giggles out of causing chaos, the only two things it seemed like he cared about was money and Harley.",Suicide Squad
2030,trugenno9,So I really like this movie and almost let reviews stop me...,9,8 August 2016,"I greatly enjoyed this movie. So much so that I decided to make an account on IMDb just to say ""really critics?"" It isn't the best movie I have ever seen but a 47% and a 26% is appalling. This is coming from a Marvel fan, this may have been the second best movie I have see this year. (Deadpool takes the cake) It was funny, serious, action packed, and just fun. In some reviews I have seen ""confusing story line,"" ""badly edited,"" ""bad CGI."" First off, the story line wasn't confusing at all, not even in the slightest. Secondly, I seen no obvious problem with the editing. It flowed pretty well. Lastly the CGI wasn't the best I have ever seen but far from the worst, even in an A list movie. I liked the characters with a few exceptions but that is to be expected with any movie. I didn't care for Captain Boomerang very much. I highly recommend ignoring the reviews and checking it out for yourselves. This may be because I have never read the Suicide Squad comics but I freaking love this movie.",Suicide Squad
2031,tristanseguin77,A refreshing adaptation from comics to cinema.,8,17 August 2016,"After watching Suicide Squad in theaters, I was very satisfied with the movie & little to complain about. And despite having everyone I know completely hating the movie for lack of plot and character development, I personally felt the opposite of what they did. I'm a huge DC comics fan and I felt that the movie was everything I hoped for. I admit walking into the movie with low expectations, but the movie still blew me away. The movies villain was unique and added a nice touch to the movie. ALL of the characters (even Captain Boomerang) were adapted perfectly into the film as well. The movie itself made me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's VERY DISAPPOINTING to see how many fans and critics outright hated the film. I know that everyone has their own opinion, but I don't feel that everyone gave the movie a fair chance after the somewhat of a disappointment that Batman v. Superman was. In short, I found the movie was incredible and I loved almost everything about it. My only complain with the film is that Killer Croc should have been replaced with King Shark (a much better animal based DC character).",Suicide Squad
2032,sjaskew42,wasted opportunity,6,8 August 2016,"The characters in this movie have so much potential but unfortunately the film has probably killed them all. And the cast was pretty good on the whole and more than capable of making a good film, but someone messed it up.I'll deal with it in bullet points.It wasn't funny. The timing was off, and with Harley, croc and the joker as excellent comedic sources. Their lines were either not funny, badly delivered/undecipherable or simply hidden/ruined by poor editing and direction. Even a good line (not many here) needs timing and directorial confidence. The soundtrack was lazy and unoriginal.The script was poor, and at times the actors saying the lines appeared tonally embarrassed. Especially Kinnaman.The joker was underused and although well portrayed by leto, his lines were not great.The squad was meant to have become like a family willing to die for each other, but for no real reason.Nothing against Cara, but I could think of many other actresses that would have suited the role better.The film looked like it was desperate to be R/18 rated but was cut to be seen by younger audiences. This was a shame as it may have worked a lot better by being darker and more graphic, after all we are dealing with some seriously disturbed characters.It came across like lots of scenes had been left out. Leaving some character choices and lines looking a little out of place.Most of the film's failings have already been done properly (see Guardians of the Galaxy)shame.",Suicide Squad
2033,neto00740,"Mess of the year -or- Watch ""Assalt on Arkham"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" for better use of your time",6,10 August 2016,"Man.....I was so hyped for this movie, I watched the trailer every week waiting and waiting.And the day arrived. First Half hour it was a good movie with a nice soundtrack, Beginning with Viola Davis introducing each member of the squad. Then the mess start....Will Smith being his charismatic self except charisma does not mean good acting. The actor had the most cringe worth performances and lines of the movie, trying to bring a big name to draw the crowd, with little to none performance to add, in a movie this hyped, is pure stupidity.Margot Robbie, although I still don't think she's that good of an actress, she is surprising the high part of the movie with her antics, comedy and seductive nature.Jared Leto is one of the low points of the movie, completely unnecessary for the movie, BUT all trainer used him as the huge high point every interview was about Leto, every video, photo was about the new Joker who was to top every single one being Nicholson, Ledger or Hamil. Should have cutted all of him and focused more on the plot of the filmCroc and Boomerang got left on the sidetracks while the director( or the studio) forced the movie solely on Smith and Robbie, wasted potential. Katana with almost no screen time does steal the scene mainly because her outfit draws attention, explaining the power of her sword was used a very corny line and that was it, better left unsaid. And the last member of the squad Diablo.....he was to be the highest point of the film, great arc, great background but that ending......destroyed all the good he has done on the filmViola Davis shines as a great Amanda Waller, but her Amanda is a terrible at her job, thanks to a horrible script. won't say more to not spoil things but when acting is concern she was the highest point of the movie.Finally, who smoke the weed that allowed Cara Delevingne be casted as enchantress? Smith in my opinion was bad on it, but she makes him looks like Heath Ledger on the Dark Knight, the excess of CGI didn't help, but it made even worse, First rule of movie making, ALWAYS cast a great actor/actress for the villain. because that's where it's going to be needed, the motivations, the rage everything must be passed to the audience, if doesn't get a good actor/actress for that part most of the times the audience won't connect. There were a lot of technical problems with the editing, and when I read that materials were taken from the joker, katana, boomerang and others off the picture, I have no choice but to believe because of the poor editing that makes scenes don't look connected and brutally cutted, the soundtrack was good, but you can't stop comparing to Guardins of the Galaxy, that was much better in comparison( despite having a poor villain as well), some songs seems to be putted there only because of the trailer, not because it fitted on the mood, I kind of enjoyed but it is important to point that out).And the ending......Ahhhh the ending...... So cliché, so much slow motion, so much cliché, so much slow motion( that was on purpose).....I never watched but every single person that has compared this ending with the final act of Fantisc 4(2015) with better CGI, might be just exaggeration, but that's how they felt on the level of horrible that ending was.I paid the ticket because I am a fan and practically had an orgarms at each trailer they release, if you aren't run away from this. A voted for a 6 because I'm a fan, and because the first half was good, but it wouldn't be overkill to but it as a 5 or 4 because of the way the second and third act went.P.S.: I'm incredible rusted on my English, if you read and saw a mistake fell free to correct me.",Suicide Squad
2034,kisaboss,Suicide Squad was a blast!,10,4 August 2016,"This movie is so fun, the squad was brilliant and the chimes try between one another was like nothing we've ever seen before. The feel of the movie was GREAT, I love this movie! All the actors played their characters perfectly and I really want to see them pop up in other DC films! Margot Robbie and Jared Leto did not disappoint and they both smashed it out of the park with these roles, Will Smith also. Jai Courtney was really funny and Captain Boomerang was a great character! Amanda Waller was superb! Viola Davis was born to play Amanda. Enchantress was cool and it was interesting to see her character on the big screen.Treat yourself, and go see this movie, I had a smile on my face for majority of the film, the action, humor and development of characters will all make it worthwhile.",Suicide Squad
2035,jjames94,DC falls short again,5,7 August 2016,"I had been waiting for this movie for almost a year and it was an incredible let down. The plot of the movie was nonexistent. Context and story lines were built from insufficient flashbacks. The trailer for the movie was better than the actual movie. The soundtrack was miserable. The movie was full of Will Smith one liners, which fell short most of the time. Rick Flagg sounded ridiculous with his forced accent. Harley Quinn was portrayed as just a sex symbol and not a real character. The relationship of the Suicide Squad team forms without any build up. Most of the dialogue occurred with just close up camera shots and there was no actual setting to the dialogue. Meaning there was no other feel to the shot besides the characters faces. Jared Leto sounded like a grunting animal for most of the movie. He and Batman were forced into the plot unnecessarily. If you ask me, the Joker didn't even need to be in the movie. Overall this movie was disjointed and the acting was mediocre. The plot was not cohesive at all. This just goes to show how Marvel has super hero movies down to an exact science.",Suicide Squad
2036,dalton-188-660623,Rest in Peace DCU,2,6 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was an immense disappointment; I enjoyed the trailers leading up to the film's release and was hoping that this would be the first DC Comics movie to actually good or even great, or at least be watchable... Unfortunately, this was not the case. This movie was so terrible that it was embarrassing. Every aspect from the writing, to the editing, to the performances were all absolutely horrible. Starting with the writing, I literally cringed when some of the characters spoke, namely Killer Croc, Harley Quinn, and the Joker. I have no clue if the actors had any input on their character's dialogue or if the blame completely rests with David Ayer. Killer Croc made me feel like I was watching a Tyler Perry movie, Jared Leto's Joker sounded like he was trying to be Christian Bale's batman crossed with some other version of the Joker. Lastly there's Harley Quinn... She seemed to serve no purpose other than to spit out garbage one liners, give the movie sex appeal, and she was there so there was a female on the squad that actually spoke*cough* Katana*cough*. I really had hopes that this movie would have funny, exciting dialogue like other projects that David Ayer wrote, but I guess he lost his mind or the producers shot his ideas down (more on the producers later). Moving on to the editing, it was shocking how poorly edited this film was. I cannot believe that John Gilroy did this seeing how he worked on good movies in the past. The quick cuts they used in fight scenes and the ridiculous neon sign like overlays that would introduce characters were so distracting and completely took me out of the movie. I think this movie shines as an example of what happens when producers have their hands where they shouldn't. Earlier this year we all heard that this movie had large re-writes/re-shoots to make the movie seem funnier, or some crap like that. Those re-shoots did not work; all they did was cause confusion and plot holes that were once again embarrassing. To finish, this movie was not funny or enjoyable in any way at all; it was cringe-worthy, lame, and cliché. It looks like this will be the last DC Comics movie i'll ever watch... Such a shame because I am a huge fan of the comics.",Suicide Squad

There was backstory on all the characters. There was a bad guy(s) that was believable. Surprises that were very well done. And all of you people who are putting 1,2,3,4 and 5 because you were disappointed are ridiculous. You act like every single movie is supposed to blow you out of the water. I think you think way too much of your selves. It's called entertainment. It's not supposed to be realistic all the time especially if it's in the fantasy/comic book realm. Maybe you should suspend your disappointment and your need for realism and just try to enjoy a movie with out having to pick a part what is wrong with it. I waited years to watch this movie because everybody said it was bad. And I laughed hard and I thoroughly enjoyed myself and that was the whole point!!!

Then, after the so said ""Suicide Squad"" is created, it creates the problem and destruction that the very same squad will have to destroy later... Really bad scrip writing here, seems like the writers were more interested in showing how ""cool"" and ""edgy"" the heroes/villains were and didn't even mind in writing a decent plot for the movie, one that actually made sense, ya know. And if you think the plot is bad, wait for the characters to show up... Harley Quinn is hot as fukk, true, but thats the only quality she has, cuz she is annoying and useless as fukk, I mean, shes only in the movie to be a sex object or something, cuz there is no other explanation for her as she has no superpowers whatsoever. And the acting of the actress is really bad and cringe worthy... Gosh. And then there is the Joker, who is portaited basically as a gangsta/rapper/thug/wigger... you got it.

Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jay Hernandez stand out. They all do an amazing job, and all killed their roles. Joel Kinnaman was good as well. I honestly can't rate Jared Leto's Joker performance. He definitely made the character his own, his portrayal is definitely different, and he was good, but you really don't get to see enough of him. The real problem with this movie is there is simply too much going on. The problem translates from DC itself, as it tries desperately to catch up/beat Marvel. Marvel built up their universe for years, developing their characters thoroughly before doing a team-up movie. DC simply jumped the gun on this one. It can't develop their numerous characters enough in only 2 hours. That being said, I honestly cannot wait to see a Batman/Deadshot or Batman/Joker movie. I think those two villains will be great in the DCEU.",Suicide Squad
2041,craigparnell,Bang Average,6,12 August 2016,"I had been looking forward to this films release since watching the first trailer. For over 6 months the expectation and excitement built up. The trailers were looking good, and after the success of Chris Nolan's Batman Films, Marvels Avenger and their tie ins, The majority of the X-men and a few of the spider-man films...expectations were high. Surely this film will continue the trend? In a word...No.I came out the cinema completely disappointed. I've waited a few days to write this review...I thought maybe I was just expecting too much and no matter how good the film was, it was never going to live up to my expectations. What I've come to realize is that the longer I've had to think about it, the worse its become. Plot = Poor could have been written by a 15 year old work experience kid. You'll have your own questions regarding plot but I'm still trying to figure out why a 'suicide squad' needed putting together when they had Batman, The flash etc to round them up in the first place. The main characters back stories are either unexplained, weak or extremely clichéd. Script / acting = Poor Even the charisma of Will Smith couldn't bring this script to life. few one liners will make you smile - mainly from Margot Robbie. again, predictable and clichéd. Soundtrack / sound = Poor Why they needed a song over every main scene in the movie I'm not sure - maybe to cover the fact there wasn't enough happening in the script or visually. became annoyingCharacters = poorOverall you feel very little connection, empathy or emotion for any of these characters. Deadshot - you know its bad when Will Smith cant even inject some charisma into a character. He dodged a bullet with independence day 2...and ran straight into a huge suicide squad shaped one. one of, if not the least memorable performance he's ever done.Harley - The shining light of the film. Robbie Nails it. She has all the one liners, all the charisma. Plays crazy pretty convincinglyThe Joker - About as scary / menacing as a trifle. Leto manages to get it all wrong where Heath Ledger got it all right. Batman - Ben Affleck is not a Batman. never has been. never will be. Temptress - poor performance from her, not helped by the fact the character she was playing was probably the worst 'bad guy' in marvel / DC history. Her faceless 'army' lacked any personality / threat. The rest - Boomerang, Diablo, katana, Flagg, and any others I have failed to mention (as they were totally unforgettable) were totally and utterly pointless additions in the film. Overall... unless you walk into the cinema with really low expectations, you will be disappointed. DC seriously need to get their **** together as this was a million miles away from the best Marvel have on offer. The recent superman films have been tragic, Wonder women looks like a car crash waiting to happens and don't get me started on aqua-man. Bang Average.",Suicide Squad
2042,vjgamesbr2011,DC / Warner v Critics impartial,10,7 August 2016,"First, the film suicide squad was intended to give a more relaxed and funny air to the DC universe, and he got a splendid way.  The criticism around the film were made by people without impartial and inconsistent arguments, the site of tomatoes is at least fan of marvel to give such low notes; therefore I imagine nothing more than a boycott or fanboys act of marvel to denigrate the image of DC in theaters.  If you are easily influenced by criticism, stop reading now, I will speak the simple truth that the film is.  The first act of the film is exciting and informative at the same time, giving the origin story of the main characters, with a technical form, somewhat unnecessarily, but still stylish. The sound track married well with the film, giving a teen tone and still captivating the public in general.  In the matter of history it contains no script hole, as usually critics say, a simple story that works from start to finish.  Interesting characters, Deadshot and Harley queen are the main characters appear on screen longer and having more lines of dialogue, but everyone in the cast has its time.  The villain of the film is good, even though cliché, but for a super- heroes film it works.  The action scenes are fast, with several cuts, but without impairing the scene. Having total 3 important action scenes.  The film's CGI works well, but it contains some parts that bother. The comics relief work well, there are not so many, but in most they work, entertainingIn the second act the tone changes a little, not interfering much in immersing the movie, the final battle is the same exciting, but it is interesting and can make a good closing of history. It is not a perfect film, far from it, but it delivers what it promised, as an anti-hero film that are recruited to defeat a villain.",Suicide Squad
2043,jalimarfebo,Fun Movie!!,10,4 August 2016,"I never read reviews before watching a comic book related movie, because it always ruins the fun, I think film critics don't always understands the story or have no idea about it, and hardcore comic books fans can't seem to separate one thing from another. I'm glad I didn't read too much about this one. It's a FUN MOVIE. It has a lot of action, super fun ""one-liners"", a little bit of comedy on every character. Margot Robbie did a GREAT job as Harley Quinn. Everyone of them was convincing. You can sympathize with some, specially with Deadshot (Will Smith) and El Diablo (Jay Hernández). I don't get why people were expecting this super dark movie when the trailers were pretty clear that it was going to be a fun movie with this incompatible group of super villains (or anti-heroes). I even think they did a great job trying to cover up the big mess of a relationship that the Joker and Harley Quinn have. The one thing I was NOT expecting was the real ""villain"" of this story. But it's a great movie, with great effects and a great cast the clearly have good chemistry. Go see it on IMAX or 3D if you have the chance.",Suicide Squad
2044,monkpunk,If a dysfunctional family you love were a movie,7,5 August 2016,"After you walk out of the theater, you will develop a dysfunctional relationship with a movie that you will hate to hate. That is precisely what this movie is - dysfunctional as a whole, yet a good amount of brilliant when dissected holistically. In spite of the top-notch entertainment value, the A- acting skills, the sporadic humor, and the relentless theatrics, Suicide Squad's greatest strength still lies in DCEU's fan-base; and in turn, the filmmaker's and the studio's inherent need to satisfy this fan-base's thirst. While in SS' case, this need definitely falls short of quenching DC-fans' now entirely parched throat, it gets brownie points for trying its level best to live up to expectations. Suicide Squad doesn't deserve all the hate it gets - as a matter of fact, if it weren't for the pretext of failed DC movies and the pressure to release a hit, Suicide Squad would've fared as a considerably above average movie outside the DCEU. Many factors contribute to making Suicide Squad a successful commercial potboiler with adequate substance (yet far more outweighing style), a few of which are: 1) The characters: Everyone plays their part with undeniable panache. Jai Courtney has objectively redeemed himself of all past Terminator sins, Will Smith is as dynamic as a convicted hit-man with a sense of humor can get, Margot Robbie is a delectable treat to watch thanks to her timing, expressions, delivery, and flawless Harley Quin-ness, and The Joker is impeccable, for as long as he is permitted to be on screen. 2) The CGI: It has its good, it has its bad, and it has its terrible. The good fortunately overshadows the rest. 3) The chemistry: While not as endearing and easy to believe as GotG's characters', all of the squad share moments that bring us as viewers closer to them, and themselves to each other. 4) The theatrics: Ayer knew exactly what he was doing. While any comic book movie consists of a certain amount of pandering to its niche audience, to balance both your own ideas with the expected theatrics and heroism from a superhero movie, is a task in itself, one of the few that David Ayer nails right in the head. But that's where the upsides of a $13 ticket end. Here is the travesty of pitfalls: The Script and the Screenplay: Supernatural enchantress, that is a 'witch'? What were they thinking? It isn't like they even balanced this pastiche with thoughtful and intelligent realism - they went all out, making even a comic book fan's appetite for surrealism shake its head in disapproval. The story was terrible, the premise was wafer-thin, the screenplay a bare minimum of okay, and the dialogues were a let- down.The flaws: In a franchise that succeeds the likes of Nolan's Batman, you would expect at least a little pedantic need for perfection. Suicide Squad completely lacks this, and does not even seem to hesitate when a few of its scenes blatantly fall short of a large movie's standards in terms of story, screenplay, and direction.Yet in spite of it all, the movie is quite easily passable as a popcorn flick, and deserves a chance if you're looking to spend two hours on a movie you will definitely enjoy, but also dislike it for its many flaws.",Suicide Squad

2047,khangbg,ridiculous,5,6 August 2016,"yup, ridiculous. I've been waiting too long for the new Joker and I absolutely disappointed. There's only a few scenes about Joker, you totally waste Joker's potential. I know this's not a Joker that everyone knew but I'm OK with that, in fact, I love Jared Leto performance but it too short. I also love Margot Robbie performance too, they both re-create the image of Joker and Harley that I've never seen before. Now is the ridiculous part. Can you take care of your story's plot more please, it's so predictable, so lame and there's nothing interesting at all. Worse, there's some point in the plot doesn't make any sense. Not only Joker, you also waste a lot of the other star's potential.

Although Cara (Enchantress) doesn't deliver the rest of the cast make up for her lack of acting ability. Leto's Joker is fresh and his relationship with Harley is strong and will fans ship them even more every moment they share. Although their is a dip in the action mid way through, it does allow the character development to take place and for fans to fall in love with the characters humour and craziness! This movie does make up for Batman vs Superman and is easily DC/ Warner Bros. finest movie to date allowing the cinematic universe to open many doors to possible solo movies and a possible Suicide Squad 2!",Suicide Squad
2049,Gman-90451,Genuinely great - I don't understand critics anymore,10,4 August 2016,"This film will not change your life. It won't win an Oscar for Best Picture, and it won't establish world peace.It will however, provide a tonne of fun for a couple of hours. It's cool, it's action- packed, it has a great soundtrack, brilliant cast, and a great understanding of the characters. Margot Robbie is a perfect Harley Quinn, Will Smith is top notch, and Jared Leto is a really, really good Mr J. Parts were a bit more touching than I expected, and I think these were really effective. The humour is good as well, though if you watched all the trailers the laughs were a bit dampened (definitely not film-ruining though, there are some good gags left to see!) There were some nice cameos which worked really well, and wait through a bit of the credits! Ignore the critics! I am one of a seemingly small number of people that liked BvS, but whilst I acknowledge that films issues and can understand the poor reviews, I'm genuinely baffled by the critics' reception to this film.",Suicide Squad
2050,edgarallanpoe-17513,"Based on what Dc gave us this year, it was pretty good",7,26 August 2016,"I had heard that the reviews for this film were less than stellar so I was not sure what to expect. I had had high expectations for this movie previously, that's true, and it wasn't what I had hoped for. I had a lot, and I mean a lot of flaw, but overall, it was much better than what you might have thought based on the reviews. I understand why the critics didn't like it that much, because, yes it is full of clichés, and the plot is stupid, a total mess and is not going anywhere, it didn't have a big action scene ( the action in general left much to be desired), the CGI was not always good, the mix between the two variations is noticeable ( we get two opening scenes, etc), the soundtrack is overused (don't get me wrong, I loved the soundtrack but there were moments it became distracting. There was loud music over dialogue, over key scenes. Sometimes it really works but sometimes it doesn't and becomes annoying) and the pacing and editing are really terrible. The first 30 minutes of the movie is only backstory after backstory as they try to introduce and establish the characters, but there are so many, and it becomes tiresome at some point. It would have been better if that had been alternated at different parts of the film and not all blend together one after the other, or even better, don't give us an backstory, give us aspects of it and the characters personality during the story, through dialogue and through their actions, and save the backstory for their own movie. And that Slipnot guy, we all knew he was gonna die from the start, and they didn't care to get us invested in his character, but than what's the point of killing the character if that leaves you no impact at all! And since there were so many characters, there wasn't enough screen time. Not to mention how some of them were so badly written and Katana was barely in the movie. We never see her using her soultaker sword. So many scenes from the trailer were cut,that one. so, from what I'm saying it seems as if I hated this movie. Well, no. To enjoy it you have to actually turn your brain off, let that be said, but overall, it was a lot of fun. It was bad-ass, and cool, and had humor, and whatever you can ask from a comic book movie. That's what it is, a typical comic book movie movie. It doesn't break new ground but it doesn't need to. The cast did a great job. Really, the best part about this movie were the characters. There is a clear intention on building up these characters over building the film . It is not about what is going on, it is about what is going on inside these character's minds that really push the movie forward. I loved everyone in the cast. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is exceptional. She delivers a performance that is straight out of Girl, Interrupted. She is extremely unpredictable on screen and it is a pure delight watching her relish in exactly what makes Harley Quinn memorable: her sultry psychotic demeanor. The chemistry between her and Deadshot is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other,is entertaining. Viola Davis also brought up her character pretty well, as she played the cold-hearted leader Amanda Waller. The rest of the cast including Jai Courtney, Joel Kinneman,, Scott Eastwood and Adam Beach, all give great performances and there isn't one false beat and that means a lot considering who little screen time and how few lines they had. Jerard Leto's Joker was one of the best things in the movie, but we don't get to see much of his performance. I am really looking foreword to see more of his Joker in the future. So in the end, I liked it more than I disliked it, and it is definitely worth your time.",Suicide Squad
2051,dmannen,This feels like an unfinished movie,2,19 August 2016,"I was VERY anticipated for this movie, just like everyone else, and I gotta say... I am disappointed.Let me begin with the positives. I like the cast. Margot Robbie was fantastic as Harley Quinn. Will Smith was also very good in the role, which was a big surprise for me. Also was Viola Davis, Jay Hernandez and even Jai Courtney was good. Many people complains about Jared Leto as Joker and I thought, with all the 15 minutes of screen time he had, I thought he did an OK job. I liked all of the Batman scenes, made me even more excited for the solo Batman movie.Now on to the negatives. The trailer made it seem like The Joker had a big role in the movie, which he didn't. Something they could've done was to remove Joker from all of the trailers and the marketing. And also all of his scenes in the movie except for the last scene where he saves Harley Quinn from the prison cell, that way his entrance to the DC-universe would have been more surprising and effective. But now you're just sitting there wondering:""How the hell did he survive the helicopter crash"" because they never explain it. Another flaw I had was that the character Katana only has two lines in the entire movie, and that would've been fine if they didn't throw in that five second scene where they try to make us care about her by explaining that her husband got killed by her sword. Boomerang is completely boring and useless. I mean what do we know about him? He has a teddy bear he likes... And that's it. Something else I didn't like was that they tried to make us think that they are all best friends in the end, but you don't buy it at all because their chemistry is very weak.I would still recommend the film because it seems like people are very split about the movie, so it's really more about what taste you have. I didn't like it, but maybe you do...",Suicide Squad
2052,aman_ter,Filler movie between DC universe superheroes,6,7 August 2016,"It starts with Waller and ends with Waller, what i am trying to say that it is just a different take from what we got used to see in DC movies, a more like marvel way with no real superheroes(which is good). Filling the space between BvS and Justice League. Joker is bad enough to say he's more like sociopath crime mafia. I never imagine that joker will be so desperate to save his girl, Harley comes good in that way. All other characters just revolve around or kinda support staff with no other story line. Will smith is a standout performer in this movie. Well wait to see what that post credit scene is meant to be as it already been explained in Bvs. Finally fun to watch.",Suicide Squad
2053,dcm-86964,A fun action movie in the DC cinematic universe starring the bad guys,8,7 August 2016,"Alright, let's get this out of the way first, this movie is NOT rotten or deserving of a 30% on Rotten tomatoes. In my opinion, it is a solid 8 out of 10 film.The movie is in the same universe as Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman. It follows a group of super-villains employed by the government to perform potentially suicidal tasks in exchange for shorter prison terms. The movie focuses on Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), and Rick Flagg (Joe Kinnaman) as they are tasked by the government under the authority of Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) to stop a supernatural threat.They are assisted by Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, El Diablo, and Slipknot. The supporting cast has minimal back story, especially Slipknot, but you are informed all you need to know about them in their back story snippets. Surprisingly, El Diablo ended up being one of my favorite characters as he got a chance the develop as the movie went along.The Joker, played by Jared Leto, also makes an appearance, but he is a very minor character.Will Smith and Margo Robbie are the stars of the show here, and they carry the movie for the most part. The first third of the film sets up the characters and the threat they are facing. The middle has the Squad fighting their way into the city to collect a high value individual. The last part of the movie has the Squad confronting the threat.Overall, the first two thirds of the movie are great. Good humor and good action. The last third of the film is semi generic, but it is still enjoyable to watch, if unsurprising.Overall, this is a fun summer action movie with a few minor pacing and story issues. I highly suggest DC comics fans and action movie fans in general go see Suicide Squad.In summary, this movie is better than Batman vs Superman was when it initially released in theaters and is completely underwriting of the critical shellacking that it has endured. Go see it and have a fun time.",Suicide Squad
2054,knishan-07460,"Good Movie, worth the time but not flawless!",7,5 August 2016,"SPOILERS!! You Have been warned! Suicide squad; arguably one of the most awaited movies of 2016. The hype was surreal ever since the trailers went out earlier this year. But after months of waiting,sitting through 2 and half hours of the movie, was the hype all worth it? In short, Yes! The movie is unlike a typical superhero movie where average Joe discovers superpowers, defeats the super villain and restores peace in the lovely city of movie world. No! It's about a group of outlawed super-humans who are used as weapons to fight against terrorism. A band of bad guys fighting a common enemy; kinda sounds like the DC version of the Avengers, but with.... well.. bad guys!! And the super villain? well she's just bad ass; a powerful, eerie witch seeking revenge against humankind. The enchantress and her brother were so powerful that the only superhero(from the squad) that could take them head on was Diablo, that too in his most powerful form. And the character was beautifully portrayed by Cara. Talking about characters, I loved Harvey Quinn; she had a nice balance between insanity and sanity, which is fitting considering her backstory. Others were pretty good too. But the joker, After Heath Ledger, in ""The Dark Knight"", I have to say I expected a bit more insanity from Jared as the Joker. Some minor things; I loved how each character had their own backstory, loved the cameos from Batman and The flash and.. well.. Superman's Coffin; and some of the minor plot twists in the movie made it lively.Now for the things that could've made the movie better. First of all, the plot is really ""A snake biting its own tail"". Out of nowhere, they make a task force out of these ""outlaws"", along with the strongest one; ""The Enchantress"". She is initially under their control, but then she escapes and tries to bring an end to human-kind. So, it was basically a story about trying to make something, making a mistake, and using that something to fix the mistake, The End(sounds pointless, putting it like that, doesn't it?) It would have been better if the super villain was someone else, someone who would've compelled the government to make the said task-force.; like, Batman! Next point is, that the plot has more ""fairy-tale"". For instance, Joker and Waller dying wasn't that serious and people could easily anticipate them coming back. But when Enchantress/June died, a moment of sadness could be felt in the hall. Then again she came back, which made the story more fairy-tale. Her death would've mixed the story up a little bit. I was desperately awaiting some major plot twist. Sadly, there wasn't any. Finally, the cliffhanger wasn't that good either. The joker was expected to return, and he did. I would've appreciated a more surprising end that would've created a huge hype for the sequel.But overall it's a good movie.",Suicide Squad

The only thing I criticize was that the plot was confusing, there wasn't enough character development, there were too many people on the team, and the Joker wasn't that good at all. However, I did praise Will Smith and Margot Robbie's performances as Deadshot and Harley Quinn. I honestly hope that the DC Extended Universe gets better writers and better directors. The Enchantress was a good, but not a great, villain. The Joker (Jared Leto) was more of a gangster villain than a dark villain (ex. Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight). Captain Boomerang did not have enough screen time for action and just made some good jokes here and then.

Just give an example (there are many): there is one scene that Harley Quinn was saved by Joker by deactivating the device in her body that would kill her if she did not obey government orders. Later Harley rejoined the squad to finish their mission. And in the end, the government claimed that they were still not free and threaten them yet again using this killing device and successfully put her back into the jail.

To me, the movie seemed like it could be a complete mess and reverse the original intentions of its source material. To start with, I couldn't stop smiling for at least a half hour from when Amanda Waller is unveiling the team, which was like a dream come true, every single character was exactly how I imagined they should be, each character had there own story and enough depth for me to actually care about each, (besides Killer Croc, who is a racial stereotype more than anything) especially The Joker, what an excellent performance from Jared Leto, stepping in a different direction which was left by the late great Heath Ledger, showing a more gangster style Joker, developing a well thought character who was in the movie enough, but still left me wanting more. As a team, the film did well to show the chemistry between characters (and lack of between others). The main problem for me was the villain, no, not enchantress, enchantress' brother who's character is so irrelevant that his name isn't even mentioned.

2062,monsterhighbiggerfan,Suicide Squad Review,6,11 August 2016,"I was really excited for this movie. What do I have to say i after i saw this movie? Pros:I really liked the acting in this. Everyone did a fantastic job. Margot did a phenomenal job as Harley Quinn. There were a lot of touching scenes with Deathshot, Harley,El Diablo.I thought they worked well.I loved Harley Quinn in this movie. She might be a crazy person but i like that there is a bit of humanity in this character. She was really funny. I also liked some of her flashbacks. Deathshot was also really good, his relationship with his daughter is good and his character development is good.El Diablo at the beginning was not that interesting but in the 3rd act i really liked his character.Viola Davis's character was great! This movie had a lot of heartI liked Jared's interpretation of the joker. I liked that he tried to be his own version of the Joker.Some action scenes were okay.The soundtrack is really good.The comedy is handled wellCons: This movie has a problem with it's writing. It feels like 3 movies in one. I am not gonna mention what types of movies I will spoil this movie. This movie was really rushed. The movie also didn't develop the villain's motivation, it just happens,the movie expects you to understand the villain's motivation.A lot of characters are not developed. I really liked Katana's design and how she was fighting but i wanted to see more of her. She didn't had any character development what so ever. There was no reason for her to be in the movie. Captain Boomerang felt he was also useless. Killer Croc is also useless, he doesn't even have a line, he has one at least.The editing of this movie was really sloppy and choppy. It was really distracting. And the songs they putted didn't fit some scenes in the movie.The action was poorly handled, it's like someone in the editing room didn't know how to edit. The Joker is barely in this movie. I literally forgot that he was even in this movie.Every scene with the Joker that you have seen from the trailers. The beginning was good but it was really exposition heavy and i thought that the introduction of the characters was way too long.Overall i thought the movie was okay. If you want to see go watch you might have a different viewing experience but i suggest you to wait for the DVD or Blu ray release",Suicide Squad
2063,irad-11066,A huge disappointment !,3,2 September 2018,"I was waiting for this movie and i've been excited about it after seeing the trailer but then while watching it i found out that it was really awful , there is no clear scenario, anyone can expect what's happening next each scene. there are so many main characters in the movie who has barely contributed in the developing of the events. The movie was also really boring and absolutely with no creativity, it's simply a big loss of money. i can't really get out with a positive point from it.",Suicide Squad
2064,lindadjewell,May be few Spoiler but amazing movie I have ever watched,10,3 August 2016,"I'm really impressed with the movie and by getting the chance to witness it earlier. It's true that I haven't experienced such a comedy and full of action movie after Deadpool but Suicide Squad really left Deadpool behind. The excellent working of Harley Quinn as psychopath and playing the role of Joker is amazing. She changes her voices and the iconic laugh of Joker is unbeatable. Well, movie was slow in the beginning while showing the origins of the characters. The best part of the starting scene is the appearance of Flash that interacts with Boomerang. Yeah they all are Badass including Katana, El Diablo, Boomerang, Killer Croc, and Deadshot. Deadshot was tried to show as the leader of Squad but due to many characters on the same mission, it didn't work. BVS and Captain America has their own place in 2016 but Suicide Squad is wonderful. You should definitely go watching it like I went wearing my Harley Quinn jacket from Fjackets.com but that's optional. I highly recommend it because it worth to have your time.",Suicide Squad

Was done well in Sin City and similar comic style movies, but was really awkward and annoying in this.Smith's story-line gave us one character to kinda want to follow, but still wasn't a very compelling watch.

2066,hugofcardoso,"""All hat, no cattle""",4,20 October 2016,"I think that everyone in here knows that after a current succession of poor movies under the name of DC Comics, this specific title garnered a lot of attention and demand, it's proportions basically sky rocketed into DC's front page, and unfortunately the nightmare happened. In terms of economics it might have ended out very positively, even dragging out the possibility for new titles, as for example, yet unexplored characters in DC's multiverse of comics being brought to the silver screen, regrettably, apparently the fronts they sought out to develop are already ""household names"".In this such film, we can observe an indubitable try on attempting to captivate the mainstream audience, mainly by concentrating star power and, in consequence, not overlooking into major plot holes in the midst.The acting and impersonating by part of the actors involved was not bad. The movie showed us some pleasing references(in case of the classic Harlequin costume and the famous Alex Ross' carnation). It even had it's share of entertaining scenes such as insight on the characters-and in some-actually made them more worthwhile, in this version of the Squad.I find many aspects, let's say, questionable, while others, purely foolish. As for the questionable side: we go from cheesy miscellaneous details -harleen's bat increments, joker's tattoos, slipknot's hair,etc...- to other types of details different from the comics, just like putting that enhancer in Deadshot's left eye(I know there's a tending independent nature from comics but this just confuses me).I gotta speak about the characters in general. Why was Spliknot even thrown in this movie, we know he's ""a bad guy"", but...honestly...have some respect. About Captain Boomerang, well, if it wasn't for the boomerangs I wouldn't even recognize him. On to Enchantress, there's something funny about her, she reminds me of Pig-Pen from Snoopy and at the same time Princess Leia(Slave); I enjoyed the choice of a Katana costume from ""The New 52""(about that, some of the original costumes would have been horrible for this movie). A bulkier Rick Flag as is the original would have been a better option. The only detail that this Croc missed was a cap or some Jordans honestly, what the hell were they thinking in this version, the point is a complete monster, not this... The Harlequin portrayed in the movie was indeed satisfying, so was this version's Deadshot. Then we have El Diablo, I grabbed a liking for him actually, then there's the other side of the coin(which I shall talk about in a moment).Now, to the ""purely foolish"" part.Everyone knows someone HAD to die in the end, of course, Slipknot died, but that doesn't count, the only reason he made part of the Squad was only for softening the punch it was going to eventually take from the majority of the hardcore community as well from critics, nonetheless, the movie had to arrange itself a scapegoat(as actually mentioned in the movie), none other than El Diablo himself, the one where it had given us room to gather some kind of affection with...Even though this movie had the continuous aspect of no structure, and when it tried to have, it kept ruining the few things where you could say otherwise. When it comes to El Diablo, when he finally shown us his true self...the cliché strikes back...""I lost it just when I was about to end it"", it was all set up since the beginning, they wanted to follow the original plan, and they got it. No martyr, just plain scapegoat. The only one that died! For his family!! What about a woman who got possessed, from whom everyone lost control of? The one indication we are left with is: the good American gets the happy ending.Now, The Joker. No, I'm not talking about Jared Leto's performance, but of the spotlight he got, after all, this movie is called Suicide Squad, and Joker isn't part of it, some of the mainstream audience might have gotten a wrong picture even, thinking, he was a member of the Squad. From an overly extended insight , over to, not one, but many appearances(they even took advantage of that to create a whole side story on him, even encouraging on a future film about Joker).Amongst other flaws, I believe that this may be the biggest. Between an occurrence threatening not only Midway City, but has said in the movie, able to compromise many cities around it(as the end drew near); while still being the home city of Hawkman and Hawkgirl, somehow, attracted zero attention to the eyes of heroes or superheroes, being that only a classified government suicide task force had been assigned to deal with it, and mainly because it was only trying to correct it's own mistakes. Of course that someone called Superman couldn't have sensed it...and that's just the tip of the iceberg...In a final note, this movie would have amounted to something far greater(even saving DC), if it was a little less self-sufficient from comics, and as an argument, it pretty much resumes the movie in a few words.(My first review of many)Exact Rate:4.0",Suicide Squad
2067,raymentderek,Nearly left,4,10 August 2016,"I can't get over how awful this movie was and it's been 12 hours. I still have that tinge of leaving the theater after watching a terrible movie feeling. That feeling that you just blew three hours of your life. I wanted so bad to like it, but I can only say I liked Will Smith in it. Other than that, it was easily the worst movie I have seen in the past six months. The worst parts of this movie include the acting from various characters, writing, plot and lack of character development, which is understandably difficult in a film that incorporates this many characters. I am not sure if it was Margot Robbie or the writing, but Harley Quinn was cringe worthy for me. Do not see this movie.",Suicide Squad

It's really quite simple: They have never picked up a comic book in their lives. The movie is very comic-book-y. It's hilarious. Corny at times, like you would expect from a comic book. Yet it is full of emotion as well. Deadshot (played by Will Smith) steals the show with artistically done scenes that will break your heart.Enchantress' CG is amazing and fun to watch. The Joker and Harley Quinn's story is both hilarious and exciting to watch unfold.The movie ties into other DCU movies as well, which is cool to see.",Suicide Squad
2069,medwell,Could of been better !!,5,8 August 2016,"I saw the film the day it was released and read a few negative reviews before hand so knew what to expect, I personally thought the film in general could of been better, the plot was pointless, some characters had no place in the film and the CGI was terrible,Deadshot: was probably the best character in the film, had most screen time, I liked the beginning when deadshot was handed his guns again and showed Rick Flag and co how to shoot was pretty cool..but..I just feel like its will smith, he doesn't act, its just will smith in a deadshot costume but he can pull that off because his such a big name in the industry, I cant help thinking if Will Smith played Killer Croc would Killer Croc of had more screen time and a better back story?Harley Quinn: Maggot Robbie played Harley Quinn really well, I liked they showed her back story with The Joker and how she become Harley Quinn but seemed like they could of made a whole film on this story line, could or would be such a good film, Maggot clearly done her research and looked into her role (unlike above), surely we will see this Harley Quinn in future DC moviesThe Joker: Jared Leto is a fantastic actor, he has taken a different spin on the Joker Character, you cant compare him to Heath Ledger, heath's Joker was more dark and evil and Jared's is twisted and crazy, both blokes gave great renditions of the Joker, only annoying part was his only in the film for a hand full of scenes, you want to see him more, maybe its DC's big plan to rope you in to see the next film they use The Joker in to pull in the audiencesAmanda Weller: Viola Davis done fantastic, was a cold and chilling character, when she kills all of her colleges because ""There not needed"" just showed how dark she really is, disappointed with the ending tho, I wont give it away, hopefully you see her again in future DC filmsEnchantress: started out a very interesting character, when Amanda Weller introduced her to the National Security Council was really cool and was looking forward to her in the rest of the film then it changed, Cara Delevingne couldn't handle the acting job, without giving to much away, her salmon dancing towards the end was shocking, maybe the CGI didn't help her but overall when the acting had to be good she was below par,Rick Flag: was a massive part of this film, was probably the character with the most screen time but why not cast a big name to go with the part, someone which could take the acting burden for the role, Joel Kinnaman was disappointing.....Killer Croc, Diablo, Katana, Slipknot was all back ground characters, didn't do much, Diablo was the only one which may get another cameo in another DC film but cant really see where and whyI have given this film 5/10 mainly because of the Characters not the Plot or CGI, this film wont be remembered for it's Plot but for Deadshot, Harley Quinn and The Joker, hopefully this is a platform for bigger and better films in the futurestay after the credits and you see a scene between Amanda Weller and Bruce Wayne",Suicide Squad
2070,heykrissyjane,"Really great and we'll worth it, just a few things that could be done better",9,4 August 2016,"Really great movie, the year long wait was well worth it. Costume design and acting was above standard. The casting of each character was on point and so was the set design. After the first half hour or so of the movie however, things did get a little messy. There was not enough dialog at times, I enjoy films that jump right into the action, but the action has to be a little more organized. Also I expected this film to be dark and kind of graphic. I was upset about the PG rating more than anything else. I feel directors are too afraid to make a superhero/villain movie that's above M, people don't seem to understand that older people watch these films too. We need more movies like Deadpool. Overall, a marvelous film. Very enjoyable though some of it is predictable.",Suicide Squad

Some of them have no names and are addressed by codes. This time round, the saviours are no longer well-known and worshiped by the people and they sacrifice for the greater good but not vanity. It's about the brotherhood rather than the leverage emphasised by Waller. The common aspect of them is that each one of them is restrained by something emotional in their life, love for family, guilt for murder, relationship with lovers... which we can somewhat relate to ourselves - the humanity in all of us, regardless of our identity. I have to say that I'm stunned by the animation and the demonstration of weapons. I'm also struck by the convoluted relationship between Joker and Harley - the insanity and persistence.

What i do not like about this Movie: 1-Some Characters seem to be Overacting e.g Amanda Waller(Viola Davis)2-The Storyline was Not Good and unnecessary.3-At last when Harley Quin meets Amanda Waller after defeating Enchantress, She should have killed her because she killed his Puddin(The Joker).4-Does they have any necessity of Captain Boomerang?5-In BvS they changed the character of Batman by killing people and in this movie they change the character of The Joker by completely changing his outfits, by making him a Gangster etc.6-Some scenes were missing in Extended Cut also i.e In Trailer the Joker says to a man,""I Can't wait to show you my toys"" and Enchantress saying in the Trailer,""Lets do something Fun"" and Rick Flag introducing members of Suicide Squad etc.7/10 Rating.",Suicide Squad

The plot could have been a little better but the characters were amazing. I think part two will be great. Really good as a comic book fan. Even comparable to civil war. Not better but comparable. I hope DC improves the rest of their movies cause the direction they are headed seems to be great. I don't want to give any spoilers away but the villain could've been better. If you seen any DC animated movies you may recognize some influences from the cartoon attack on Arkham. To me these were positive influences.

I read a lot of the reviews to see what others think of the movie. first of bad CGi?? i Had Not a single problem with the CGI as a normal movie fan you wouldn't even see it so for the people who haven't seen it no problem there ill guarantee it. but at last you need to see the movie yourself to give you're own opinion on it. so if you're gonna watch it or not i recommend it but you don't need to if you don't want to.",Suicide Squad
2076,ryanslee-66881,An Enjoyable Comic Book Movie,8,6 August 2016,"Never shying away from the fact that it was a comic book movie, Suicide Squad embodies the outrageous and unrealistic atmosphere that comic books are famous for. With heavy acting power behind the characters, you'll come to love each and every one of them for their own personal quirks that make this team the comedic loose cannon shown in the trailers. I am genuinely interested to see future movies featuring these characters, specifically Jared Leto's Joker as I felt he didn't have enough scenes to make a full impact, although he still did a terrific job. Hopefully we'll see more of him in the Batman standalone film. If I had one gripe with the movie, it would be that I think the villain wasn't the best choice for the first Suicide Squad film, and it added a risky element that could've been used in later films much better. However, it didn't do much to reduce my overall happiness with this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and think it's a great watch with a couple friends or family.",Suicide Squad
2077,mattycass,A bad movie with good moments,3,12 August 2016,"Having had time to think about this movie for a week now I now feel I know what I have to say. Suicide Squad is a bad movie with good moments. This movie is a complete mess. But it is a fun mess. The first act is the messiest part of the whole film. It consists of a lot of exposition about the characters, with ""scenes"" (It's hard to call them scenes, as they are more like 10 - 20 second clips with no context what so ever, and have no beginning or end) about some of the main characters. It all feels very rushed and does not flow at all. Some parts of the second act were also like this, and when any flash backs happened a lot seemed to be missing. The editing of the film is very poorly done. The action sequences were underwhelming too, with the finale being very cliché and uninventive. The villain was nothing special, and their motivation was unclear. I have no opinion of the Joker as he was not even in a full scene. I know nothing about the character and Jared Leto was hugely wasted. Finally, a lot of the characters were not fully fleshed out.The best part of this film were the squad, more specifically Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Diablo, Captain Boomerang and Rick Flag. Although Captain Boomerang was not very fleshed out, he had some funny and memorable moments, and was portrayed excellently. Will Smith as Deadshot was nothing we haven't seen Will Smith do before, but that is not a bad thing. We see a humane side to him too, which makes us care for him more. Harley Quinn was exactly what she needed to be. She was almost sort of a Wild Card, and was portrayed wonderfully by Margot Robbie. She had great chemistry with Will Smith too. The whole cast had great chemistry. Diablo and Rick Flag were also portrayed well, with clear motivations and were semi- fleshed out, so we cared a bit for them. The writing was also okay, with believable dialogue for the most part. Some of the jokes felt forced and some were rather cringe worthy, but for the most part it worked.To conclude, I think this movie is worth seeing as it has a lot of good moments, but is still a huge mess. You will enjoy it because of the characters, even though it is still a mess. Warner Brothers, sort it out mate.",Suicide Squad
2078,KeiferMax,Great Movie,10,21 April 2017,"I don't know what all the crybabies are whining about. This is a very well put together movie. Will Smith holds his own and leads the talented ensemble through this maze of organized chaos. I don't know why you all are hating on it so much! The movie is supposed to be FUN.. not bring World Piece! I thoroughly enjoyed escaping reality for a couple hours. I followed the plot easily enough and the screen writing did a pretty good job with throwing in puns and keeping the action at a pretty good clip. All in all, I think they did a pretty damn good job on this flick! Now don't be throwing a bunch of hate my way!

2079,cross_joao,It had too much high expectations to hit the mark.,6,7 August 2016,"So this is my first time reviewing so I'll try to keep this short. I've seen people hating it and I've seen people praising it.I'm in the middle.Pros:Great variety of characters. Great visuals and special effects(better than BvS). Cool action sequences. Great soundtrack.Cons:Poor plot. Some characters were underdeveloped or felt out of place(e.g: Katana) Jared Leto's Joker, although has a nice attitude, it doesn't feel like the Joker.Also, his appearance doesn't contribute in anyway to the story.Rick Flag's and Dr.Moone's romance didn't convince anyone.It's a solid 7 out of 10. It has it's high points but it also has many flaws. Definitely a step up comparing to BvS. Some characters really felt out place like Slipknot but especially Katana. This movie focused mainly on Harley Quinn and Deadshot and little bit on El Diablo but Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc were left in the dark. The villain's weren't memorable either and Cara Delevigne's character has no substance to it. Probably only had like 20 lines in the whole movie. It's a good summer flick to watch with friends that could have been great if it was a little more polished. Sorry for any grammar mistakes.",Suicide Squad
2080,zbixby,"I wanted to like it, but a mess of a movie is still a mess of a movie.",3,8 August 2016,"I want to preface this but saying I am a long time comic reader, nearly two decades of reading DC comics have given me an expansive knowledge of the universe.So it's possible that I have a bias based on my knowledge. Unfortunately even as a movie this becomes a huge mess after the first act.The first act feels nice, you can't get into to much characterization with such an expansive cast so we have to make due with one character telling us about them. It works as a set up, but after that it becomes one big mess. Scenes felt cut and added for no reason other than trailer fodder. There is no connection between some scenes and it becomes terrifyingly noticeable to the extent that it draws you from the film. The best part of the movie was Jai Courtney, which is weird to say. That's not to say Margot Robbie and Will Smith weren't good in their parts. But when you have to keep Dead Shot's mask off just to give Smith face time it becomes a problem. As for Robbie, well you can certainly say someone looked through some comics and found every one of her jokes to add into the movie. Otherwise she's there for eye candy. Killer Croc looked like a joke (what the hell was up with his huge traps and then tiny tiny TINY body?!?!) and that was a huge waste of the villain of Enchantress (who just looked like she was hula dancing in every one of here scenes.) Last but not least let's talk about Leto. I was holding out hope for his portrayal of the Joker. But between his lack of actual scenes in the movie (most of his scenes are in the trailer) and the fact that he MUMBLES every one of his lines thanks to all the metal they put in his mouth, he is easily last on my list of favorite Joker portrayals. It's not a terrible movie, there are a few stand out scenes, but it's definitely not a good movie.",Suicide Squad

Sadly the plot is too big! Suicide squad has this urge to be big and bad and take place on a huge scale, which doesn't blend well with the characters at all! The Villain is very poorly executed, and doesn't add anything to the movie. The actors chosen played the roles very well, but the camera work and editing were very chopping and not appealing! The editing was very bad, for such a high budget film! The movie had a lot of moments where certain things didn't make sense, or wasn't explained or were just really dumb.

2082,AngeloMallardo,"They're the bad guys, and this is a BAD movie.",4,18 August 2016,"--SPOILER FREE REVIEW--After the big disappointment that was ""Batman v Superman - Dawn Of Justice"", I really hoped that Suicide Squad would've been the renaissance of the DC Extended Universe, which started really horribly. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This movie wasn't even fun to watch. Let's take a look at the mistakes that this movie has:-MESSY AND STUPID PLOT: there are dozens of other ways this movie could have been written. But the writers chose the worst way. The villain is useless and stupid.-THE JOKER: Jared Leto's Joker is actually good, physically speaking. The problem is, he doesn't fit into this movie. He appears for something like 10-15 minutes in the whole picture, and I think he should have got more appearances in the movie and be like the main villain, or something like that.-THE EDITING: That's the biggest shame of this movie. Suicide Squad, not only has A LOT of deleted scenes that would have given more sense to the movie, but it probably has been edited by a 5-year old kid. Seriously, I've seen Youtube videos in 2008 edited better. And also, it does have a good soundtrack (catchy and fitting songs like Heathens, Sucker For Pain or Without Me) but it's badly stuck in the movie.So, in the end, I think this movie should be seen in schools by students so they understand what a movie shouldn't be like.It's just WRONG.",Suicide Squad
2083,pitchxperfect,Rant/Rave,7,6 August 2016,"Okay, so I admit, I'm a little biased. As someone who's been an avid Harley Quinn fan for years (as well as a Jared Leto fan), I will attest to the fact that Robbie and Leto were the main grab for me, as I'm sure they were for 85% of audience members. That being said, I have a few qualms about how these characters are portrayed. Let me start out by saying this movie was DA BOMB . The soundtrack is great, the cast is diverse (although I could've done without Cara Delevingne's poor excuse for acting), the characters are strong, and, despite extenuating circumstances, altogether likable.However, being of the 85% who saw it for two main reasons, I was a bit disappointed. I am not here to compare Jokers (to be honest, I'm in the small minority that didn't enjoy Nolan's version of the DCEU), but to analyze the complex, and infamous dynamic between Harley Quinn and the Clown Prince, himself.This relationship is not one to aspire to, built on lies, abuse, and manipulation. Harley Quinn is an inherently feminist character, not because she's subject to such abuse, but because she is a well-written, relatable, anti-hero who, at the end of the day, is actually brilliant (she is a doctor, after all). Yet, despite having the body of a 10 and a psychotic super villainous boyfriend, she is just like us—those who would do (almost) anything to attain that love and validation we so desire.With that in mind, I was very disappointed to see so little backstory between HQ and MJ (Mistah J). On-screen, the relationship between Robbie and Leto's characters actually comes across as love. Robbie even becomes ""dumb,"" or as Liz Lemon would put it, a ""sex idiot."" She's there for the box office—she possesses little to none of her characteristics that have brought her character such appreciation over the years. She is literally just there to look sexy, and get punched in the face, and run into poles as a gag. ""Haha, watch the hot girl run into bars. Isn't it funny?""HQ has, unfortunately, become a character that exists strictly for the male gaze; a sex pot in hot pants that can beat people up and is probably a freak in bed. Yes, I am disappointed that this is what she's become. But more disappointed for the women watching it, thinking that she's someone to aspire to—someone who's worth is based solely on her looks, and who has found ""real love"" with a green-haired, lipstick- wearing sociopath.That being said, this movie is more than worth the $20/ticket price tag, for the enjoyment alone. Will Smith is charismatic beyond charismatic, and we really get a feel for the humanity of these villains (and the inhumanity of the ""good guys;"" re: Amanda Waller).7/10 Stars",Suicide Squad

A great time at the movies",8,8 August 2016,"The third installment in the DC Extended Universe, ""Suicide Squad"", was almost an antithesis of the movies before it. Director David Ayer was clearly taking notes when people were criticizing ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"". This movie goes out of its way to create new characters that you could truly care about, even at a small level. Will Smith and Margot Robbie managed to fully embody the characters from the comics they are based off of, while also bringing something new to the table. And of course, there is the matter of Jared Leto's Joker. This was first portrayed on the silver screen in 1966. However, 50 years later, Jared Leto manages to make all of the viewers feel as if they are watching a brand new character. He makes no attempts to stack up against Nicholson or Ledger. He creates a character all his own. To the movie critic, this movie may seem imperfect. Many filmmakers would have did this movie very differently. However, to the comic book fan and the average moviegoer, this movie did very well. It is a fun movie, and to sit down and watch this movie is just a treat.

2087,ilukankovaite,Waste of time and money,1,9 August 2016,"Well were do I begin. I was so excited to finally see this movie, so when my friends offered to go to the movies I was ecstatic. Popcorn in my hands and here the fun begins or so I thought. Sadly this was one of the most disappointing films I have seen in a while. First of all the story line is chaotic, mixed and unclear. There's no start to movie, beginning up until middle is just a mess and only from the middle the story some what makes sense. The end is sooooo over due. The slow motion was good in some parts but the final of the movie was so long that I was ready to leave not even waiting until the slow motion will end. Second of all who the hell decided to cast Cara Delavigne for this part?! This is beyond me. Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of Cara's but her acting skills are surely not up to part compared to so many other people in the movie. She should stick to modeling where she's awesome at. The only well played character was Harley Quinn. Loved her, the humor was on point she was the only one who got me trough the movie sane. Other actors (even Will Smith) were so mediocre it was painful to watch. Definitely not worth the hype and definitely not worth the money to go and see it in the theaters.",Suicide Squad
2088,diabeticsuga,Still Fun Despite a Seeming Lack of Direction,7,6 August 2016,"The big problem with this film is a problem Batman vs. Superman had: instead of introducing characters in a stand-alone film, they tried to cram multiple characters' backstories into one movie, leaving it feeling disjointed. So at the very beginning of the film, we're shown something similar to a trailer for each of the members of the Suicide Squad, leaving us little time to set up a conflict for our characters to go through. It's rather unclear what the motive even is until half-way through the movie. The second half of the movie is a lot better than the first, since most people will be able to pick up what's been happening, plus we get to know our characters even better. That's the one thing this film does well; we're finally able to see a more human part of the villains in a comic-to-movie adaptation. Even though the villain is rather lame and has no setup, a lot of the fight sequences are fun. If nothing else, this is a fun movie that tossed out a lot of jokes that earned laughter from the audience. One last thing to praise is the diversity of the cast, that not only featured multiple ethnicities, but also let them speak in their native tongue, which was a refreshing change. Despite feeling rushed, it was a nice movie to help take your mind off things for a while.Also Deadshot stole the show. Joker who?",Suicide Squad
2089,jordiw,"Fun movie. Not perfect, but fun.",5,12 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was an okay movie. It's wasn't good, nor was it great, but it was okay. Just okay. It was enjoyable and the action scenes were highly entertaining to watch; however, it was in no way perfect.Yes, it was nice to see characters like Harley Quinn and Deadshot on screen (along with the others), but just because it was nice to see those characters, doesn't mean this movie is getting a 10/10 star rating any time soon. The overall structure of the story made it seem very much like the writers were trying to stick square pegs into circular holes, after those holes were previously carved.To put it simply, since BvS wasn't too loved by the critics (though, that's not to say it wasn't loved by the fans) and a lot of people (but not all) thought it was very 'dark' and 'gritty', they had to re-shoot a lot of scenes for Suicide Squad to satisfy those people who didn't like just how dark and gritty their last movie was, which I'm inclined to believe is the reason why there are random scenes scattered throughout the movie that make almost no logical sense whatsoever, when it comes to concerning the plot.And a lot of those random scenes were flashbacks, which was the film's way of trying to get the audience to know the characters. On some level, it succeeded. But there were way too many characters in the movie to successfully show to the audience in just a little over two hours.Everyone's backstory was basically only around five to ten minutes long, and they were all crammed into this film. (I did enjoy some of them, though!)Again, I get that the writers needed to introduce the characters before moving along with the plot, but the way they did it just added to this movie's already convoluted structure.Now, obviously this film had its faults. And let's face it: what film doesn't? But that didn't make it an awful movie. It was okay. It was entertaining. It certainly wasn't terrible. And I doubt I would have any regrets about watching it again. The action scenes were fun, and it was great to see characters that haven't been in the DCEU yet...actually be in the DCEU.It was a pretty fun movie, and I enjoyed it. A little messy, but it was entertaining to watch. (Note: I tried not to spoil the film too much, just in case those who are reading this have not watched it, but there is a spoiler warning, as a precaution.)",Suicide Squad
2090,osgard,"""Worst Heroes Ever""-""Worst Movie Ever""",6,1 August 2016,"Seriously man had a lot of expectations around this movie. But just like Batman v Superman: DOJ it disappointed me more then Batman v superman. Things that I hate most. Action- plain bad, hows is this even called superhero movie. CGI - It was so realistic that u can even see which parts are CGI. Story: u have seen the trailer right ? yeah that's all. Acting: All of their acting was amateurs like they'r paid less except Waller's. Starting: slow paced idiotic things. Editing: Oh god..... somebody please help DC out. JOKER: A wannabe joker no near close Heath. And the rest of the movie is full of clichés and bad jokes and unnecessary shenanigans that anyone can think of.",Suicide Squad
2091,lucdeijkers,Mediocre at best.,6,6 August 2016,"First I'd like to state that I do not read comic books, nor am I in anyway engaged in the DC universe. I just really (really) love movies.For me this is the type of movie which, in my mind, gets categorized in a certain group. A group which, in my opinion, already has an abundance of likewise movies in it. Easy, simple and entertaining would be a good name to paste on this group. Because that is what this movie is. Simply entertaining. Like all movies in this imaginary category it: Is minimally re- watchable, doesn't have a rock solid plot, it contains many stereotypes and clichés,...etc I know it may now sound like I am bashing this movie, and you might be left thinking: ""Why bother giving it a six, then?"". Because the truth is, we all sometimes prefer to mindlessly watch a blockbusting, action-y movie, with many explosions, gun fire, and a few jokes here and there. And this is absolutely okay, but if I was considering too see this movie, I would like someone to tell me what I was committing the following two hours to. And no, I don't despise this movie in any way. I just expected something different, seeing the marketing/budget and all.The biggest turnoff for me was that it seemed too typical. Like, if you expect it to be a hilarious film filled with witty jokes(i.e. Deadpool) then, I'm sorry to have to upset you but you will not be getting what you paid for. If you are expecting a bad-ass, ruthless movie (which I don't blame you for wanting, since it's a movie filled with a ton of villains). Then once again I have to let you down. Suicide Squad is somewhere in between these two movies. And no, this is not a good thing, because, simply put, there are already a too many movies like this.Also, finally I would like to say a last thing. Which is something that can only be said about few movies: Suicide Squad would have benefited from a lower budget. But you will notice this when you see the movie for yourself. TL;DR If all you want is mindless entertainment (I don't blame you, sometimes we are just in the mood for this.) this movie will definitely satisfy (if you know what to expect). But for anything other than that, I don't recommend this movie. Still it will be worth watching when it premieres on cable. Lucas Deijkers",Suicide Squad
2092,MSDisaloser,It felt like one big trailer,3,4 November 2017,"This movie is absolutely terrible. It has some redeeming qualities like um.... Will Smith as Deadshot is good compared to the rest of the cast. The editing is the some of the worst I have EVER seen. The editing especially with the character intros makes it feel like a trailer and it's extremely annoying. The story is f***ing stupid with so many things that will just make you go "" What the **** were they thinking? "". The soundtrack is also horrendous with contributions from such great artists as... Wiz Khalifa,Imagine Dragons, Skrillex, Big Ross, and many more! The characters are also EXTREMELY CRINGY with Harley Quinn having lines that made me physically cringe. Overall this movie is dog**** and the only reason I'm giving it a 3 is because "" Fortunate Son "" is in the movie.3/10",Suicide Squad
2093,alimasum-54558,Suicide Squad (2016),7,14 August 2016,"Watch Full Movie : http://themovieszone21.com/movie/297761/suicide- squad.htmlSuicide Squad has been the long gestating DC Comics film that every single fan on the planet has been waiting for. From the controversial casting of Jared Leto as the Joker to the rumored reshoots, this is a film that has been on everyone's minds for the past two years since it was announced. So, how does it hold up? Well, let's start off with the great. The greatness in the film sits on many shoulders. Jared Leto as The Joker is probably the most interesting part of the film. Leto does not even try to top Ledger or Nicholson, he simply does his own thing. He's devilishly charming but extremely psychotic. I compare him mostly to Mark Hammil's Joker from the animated series in the 90s. It is unlike anything we've seen before so, for that, I give it kudos. It is pretty cool seeing this type of Joker but I will admit, I would have loved to have seen more of him. What is a good actually is a bit of a bad. Leto is in it for merely 25 minutes tops which is a bit disappointing considering his performance is absolutely mesmerizing. On to the rest of the Squad, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is exceptional. She delivers a performance that is straight out of Girl, Interrupted. She is extremely unpredictable on screen and it is a pure delight watching her relish in exactly what makes Harley Quinn memorable: her sultry psychotic demeanor. Will Smith as Deadshot is just Will Smith. There is no real boundary breaking performance here. He is the lead actor of the film and the film plays out like such. Not saying that Deadshot isn't a cool, badass character but it is just Will Smith in costume. The rest of the cast including Jai Courtney, Joel Kinneman, Viola Davis, Scott Eastwood and Adam Beach, all give great performances and there isn't one false beat. There is a true chemistry on the screen that is palpable and David Ayer deserves high praise for that. The film is good but the performances are great. There is a clear intention on building up these characters over building the film which is another good quality turned bad. The film itself is a typical comic book movie of the 21st century. It is heavy on the characters and extremely light on plot and a villain. The first twenty minutes are spent introducing these characters, not a plot, just these characters. This is cool at first but once you realize most of the important plot points are in the trailers, it becomes a bit disappointing that there isn't a villain to rally against just anti-heroes to rally behind. By many standard traditions, this is a film very close to The Dirty Dozen or The Magnificent Seven. It is not about what is going on, it is about what is going on inside these character's minds that really push the movie forward. It is an ensemble character piece above all else. While much of the spoilers have been spoiled long ago, there are still a couple things that will bring smiles to fan's faces. So, overall... Does it break new ground? No. Is it badass? Yes. Is it fun? Absolutely. Should you see it? Without a doubt. Suicide Squad is definitely going to put some nerves at ease since Batman V Superman. But DC has a long way to go in terms of churning out undeniably great comic book films outside of The Dark Knight trilogy and Suicide Squad is most certainly a great start.",Suicide Squad
2094,shreyamantu,Great watch,10,5 August 2016,"Fun movie. Might be a disappointment for the people who love the marvel formula.Not a bright movie with lots of jokes. Follows the dark tone world created by the past two DCEU movies. People wanted a 'simpler' plot and a simpler plot was given .There is not much of Joker as expected fromt the trailers. It is not a joker movie and is a suicide squad movie which does not include the Joker.And the Joker is fairly a side character giving life to Harley Quinn.So to Judge Leto we have to wait for an actual movie with the Joker. Is a perfect mix of realness and a comic book movie that DC likes to follow. The character development is done very well in a very small time . Will smith works very well as Deadshot and feels very in place. Margot Robbie is great as Harley Quinn. Some surprisingly emotional scenes in the movie. There is adequate chemistry between the characters. The movie is funny as Deadshot and captain boomerang give out great one liners .All in all is a movie worth watching .Has simple writing that is very fun to watch .Funny ,dark and gritty at the same time.",Suicide Squad
2095,kurtis-06710,The Truth,10,3 August 2016,"I AM A DC FAN, most of which were disappointed, aren't real DC Fans. Here's why. Suicide Squad was judged too quickly off of the trailer, plus the failure of Batman v Superman. What seems to be thrown around too much in these critic articles is that DC and Marvel are alike. No, they aren't. DC is a darker world, of course you're going to see the use of guns. In a world where the protagonist is against weapons (batman), the villains are obviously going to use them. NO SPOILERS. The movie is great, I loved it. I failed to see what's wrong with it other than the costume design (which we already understand from the trailer). Sure it was over hyped in the trailer, but that was the pitch, we were given that hype during the duration of the film. More towards the story line, it was basic to start with, we get our intro. The intro expands on the antagonists' back stories, due to certain events involving a dark entity (totally DC) and uncontrollable circumstances, they're forced into a squad. Due to the traits/powers each of them hold, it reflects their personalities. And like magnets, opposite personalities take time to mix. In certain scenes you start to understand how they bond over small things, it makes you feel for these bad people. A lot of critics have gone off of the quote Bad v Evil with this film, I don't necessarily think that's the case. I feel it's more Convicts v Demons. DC is entirely based around God V Man and I feel that Marvel has stolen the spot light with the lead up to that (our wait for Thanos). Suicide Squad has skipped that wait, which I feel is a good thing because it doesn't give us a cliff hanger. It's giving the fans what we want instantly, no money schemes for upcoming films like Marvel. Back to the film, I didn't think it was cringed or overly dramatized. Most of the characters lines came directly from the comic books, so these critics are idiots. If you've watched Batman v Superman, you're getting an improvement. Not everything starts perfectly. I believe DC is working its way up, and Marvel isn't happy. I recommend you see this film guys, it's worth it I promise.One more thing I thought I might add... Heath Ledgers joker was extremely different from the comic books Joker, don't be surprised if Jared Leto's Joker is also. Heath's was serious and dark, Jared's is the humorous balanced of brightness we get in this cinematic universe. 10/10, I walked into this film afraid of the reviews, I came out confused as to why. It's an incredible film DC.",Suicide Squad
2096,garyclampitt,Average Film - Silly Ratings,5,10 August 2016,"My first post because I cannot understand why people rate films so stupidly. Suicide Squad must be one of the most varied reviewed films I have seen. I have no idea how people can rate this 10/10 or 1/10. Is this the best or worse film ever made. - No!Pick your best film you've ever watched - this is 10/10. Pick your worst - this is 1/10. Rate this film by comparing it to best and worst.Take away all the hype and this is just an average 'superhero' film - 5/10. I expected a lot more but it wasn't the case.My only other comment is the lack of humour: There must be approx 10 times in the film, when a comment is said or situation happens and the camera pans to one of the other cast (mainly Harley) for the punchline. Each time this happened, not a single person in the packed cinema laughed. Obviously the script writers thought the one-liner response was funny but not the audience when I watched it.",Suicide Squad
2097,alejandrosalas-61355,This movie was great,9,19 August 2016,"This movie did have its flaws but over all it was very fun, entertaining, and filled with action. It had great CGI. I don't get why the critics bash it so much. They way the characters are introduced really tells a lot about them. Harley Quinn was by far the best character as Margot Robbie plays her well. Also boomerang was pretty funny too, and the actor also played him well. Cara Delavigne was great at playing enchantress although thats the only part i didn't like. I expected enchantress to be part of the squad instead of being the main villain. It was pretty stupid to have her dancing around the tornado. I would definitely recommend this movie and watch it again, it is a great addition to the DCEU",Suicide Squad
2098,zlatansepic,Boring and full of Clishés,5,8 August 2016,"Let me start off by saying that I entered the theater with high hopes despite the bad reviews the movie was getting. I left with disappointment and sadness.To me the main flaws were that the characters were undeveloped, the plot predictable and boring and it was full of chishes. And i mean a lot of clishes. Everything from El Diablo sacrificing himself to save others to pretend to join the villain but end up betraying him to character thought dead not dead etc.And the characters, oh my. The only real development was given to Harley Quinn, Deadshot and El Diablo. Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc were there for the one liners. All we know about them is: Boomerang robs banks and uses boomerangs and Killer Corc is a monster and he lives underground. Enchantress as the villain is like the evil witch from princess stories the way she talks and moves.You can watch it as a mindless cheesy action flick. It's basically The Expendables.

2100,GreenBlu7,"It was a good watch, but not worth to die for.",6,7 August 2016,"For a movie centered around villains, this is a moderate start for DC and Warner Brothers. It was nice to see some of the villains to gain some backstory, such as Harley Quin's obsession over the Joker, Deadshot's loss of his family, Diablo's lack of his heat control, and Flag's desperation in eliminating demon witch within his girlfriend. Plus, the humor does give me a chance to see how the characters interact with each other, along with the action to let them have the spotlight. However, with all of the positive this movie has, it still cannot be considered perfect with its loose ends. Although we do see focus on most of the characters, there are still a few roles that I believe need to have more development on.One of the characters I was hyped to see in this film was Katana, and I was hopeful to know how she is characterized (since I've never read any of her comics). According to the movie's official website, Katana's bio states that, as second in command next to Colonel Flag, her duty is ""...to keep the others in line."" But, after watching the film, I was disappointed to see that she doesn't do much to keep the squad members disciplined. All she did was lamented for her deceased husband, and slashed a few minions. I never saw her ran after the protagonists when they make a mistake (ex: In the middle of the film, Harley attempts to leave the squad for Joker, and Katana didn't even move an inch to stop the madwoman). This is the same feeling I got with Killer Croc, whom I was also interested to know about. I haven't any of his comics, yet was still curious to understand how he got his scales. Similar to Katana, Croc doesn't get a lot of back story. Both of them did fight throughout the second-half of the film, but that was all I got out of it. Slipnot was another character that didn't get a lot of attention. You know, the assassin who was recruited in the squad, and was later tased internally for his disobedience. He is the guy whom I remembered punched a lady at the villain's prison camp, and that was it. Although I wish the writer could do more with Slipnot, he really didn't need to be part of an over-sized squad. Viola Davis' character, Amanda Walker, was very difficult to understand. As far as I know, she convinced the government that the squad members can be contained, shot some of her working clients for no reason, survived from a aircraft crash and ward off some the minions, and is still a part of the government. You can correct me, if I'm wrong about her actions/character in the film. It's just that I expected a lot of her that the result made me care less of Davis' character even more. Finally, we have the main villain: Enchantress. A witch whom over a thousand years was trapped within a voodoo doll, and escaped thanks to her alter ego, June Moore. She's the same witch who wants to destroy humankind because of one thing: technology. Yep, that is the only reason, the ONLY REASON why Enchantress wants to wipe out humanity. Humans shouldn't use technology, even though SAMSUNG IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS FOR THIS FILM! Yeah, nothing like shaming the human race for doing a bad deed, when the film itself is a part of it, too. Sounds familiar (The Lorax)? With all that said, this isn't the perfect comic flick for the summer. I'd rather watch Captain America: Civil War again than to see this suicide mess. But, at least ""Suicide Squad"" did held some water make it through. So, is worth the watch? Maybe, if you haven't seen it and wondered what everyone's talking about. While I may not want to watch this movie again, it was a good way to end the summer.",Suicide Squad
2101,mickeymose,I liked it!,10,7 August 2016,"The movie deserves better reviews because its not as bad as what the critics says. The combination of dark elements and humor is just perfect. What the movie lacks is the exposure of the other characters (e.g. Capt Boomerang and Killer Croc and also Katana). I want to see more from them. I'm hoping there's a directors cut for this because I'm definitely watching it. The acting is great actually, I don't get all the hate for the actors. Viola Davis did a great job. Amanda Waller is ruthless and fearless too and that's what Viola delivered. I'm sad why people are getting mad because joker didn't get much screen time, maybe because of the fact that he/is/NOT a member of the squad? Maybe if the movie is about injustice league he would have had more screen time. Anyway, He did a great job portraying joker. Very close to the comics joker. Of course the movie is not perfect but you will like it. It has many reference from the comics itself.I need to see the ultimate cut of this film.

First, most people don't read comics, much less ""suicide squad"" so I don't understand how they can give it bad reviews. Second, if you ever read a Suicide comic, this movie is exactly how it should be. I can think of no better way that this movie could have done better. Every actor was on point, it was straight forward and didn't jump around at all. The humor and action was all there, and the visuals were great. DC has been failing for awhile now, and I hope they can ride this wave and continue this story! If I were to rate Batman V. Superman it would have been a 4.",Suicide Squad

Jared Leto's metro sexual Joker is underused and Heath Ledger's Joker is a lot better. Jai Courtney is one of the worsts actors in the world, why is he even in this movie? I really want to like DC because I hate stupid Marvel movies, but this movie is not good at all, actually it's really bad.The visual effects looks very comical tho I don't like it at all. Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight was a lot better than this trash.So that's my final conclusion. This movie is barely watchable, and for me superhero movies are dead. I always hated stupid Marvel movies for children, and I thought DC can make some real good superhero movies, but I was obviously wrong. Bring back Christopher Nolan, or just don't make any movies. But I'm sure you will milk this brand anyhow.",Suicide Squad

2105,mhargrave-20714,"Suicide Squad is okay, which is WAY better than Batman v Superman",7,9 August 2016,"I saw this movie on opening day because I'm such a fan of Harley and Joker together. Batman: The Animated Series was my show growing up. Harley and Joker WERE that show. Suicide Squad fell flat because of the absence of them. Jared Leto's Joker was great, and refreshingly different than past Jokers (Heath is still #1), but I was super annoyed by his lack of screen time. Every time Joker came on the scene, I was immediately interested, but he was there for only seconds at a time.Margot Robbie as Harley was fantastic. But, part of Harley's silly, craziness happens when she interacts with Joker and/or Batman. We got the tiniest of a glimpse of it in the beginning of the movie. Harley rides in a car with Joker, then Batman appears in the Batmobile and chases them. During this car chase we get the awesomeness of Harley's wicked humor and crazy girlfriend traits. Every scene that involved Joker and Harley together were by far the best scenes. Their silly, crazy, demented relationship together is what the movie should have focused on. Enchantress should not have been the main villain, it should have been Joker. Because he's JOKER. You can't have Joker in a film about DC Villains and not have him be in the forefront.Will Smith was the only other part of the movie that I liked. He was hilarious and perfect as Deadshot. The Squad should have just been Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, Enchantress, Rick Flag, Katana, with the addition of Nemesis. The main villains should have been Joker and Harley.",Suicide Squad

From my perspective in this film the director should to choose his characters carefully because it will be the beginning of a long series of films inspired by comics, such as this work brings infelicitous company DC, and I hope the next time they choose an interesting story and appealing even attract viewers and make them love Characters as we all loved the Marvels Characters.",Suicide Squad
2107,folarinfifo,Absolute Nonsense from start to finish,4,10 August 2016,"I went into this movie with ridiculously high expectations. That was my mistake, I guess. The fact that the movie wasn't even remotely good is not really the actors but DC/WB and the directors fault.Firstly I'll give my view on each of the squad as well as a few others.Harley Quinn: Margot Robbie was by far the best thing about this movie and she wasn't outstanding. She was really a presence in every scene. Backstory could have been explained better.Deadshot: Controversial is what I'd call this decision. Will smith didn't play the cold blooded killer Deadshot is suppose to be except for one scene. He was alright as he was given a lot of screen time.Boomerang: absolute crap and didn't need to be there.Katana: so irrelevant and wasted, also didn't need to be thereSlipknot: I guess an example had to be made but at least an intro would have made his death more emotional.Killer croc: so he just lurked around the whole time and made some noises before going swimming.El Diablo: wasn't very good until the end when he actually did something. Another waste overall.Joker: unnecessary and somehow is now immune to missiles. Didn't like his look or voice.Waller: quite menacing and well acted but she should have ended up dead tooRick flag: So that's the characters so let's talk about the plot. Actually lets not because there wasn't one at all. Such a stupid villain. I mean enchantress danced for most of it and then decided after her brother died which also is senseless (I'll explain later) that she would engage the humans in a sword fight when she has the ability to teleport and basically destroy anything in her path. I mean why not just teleport and take your heart back. She can also give visions and see what people want and yet failed to realize that Harley was going to stab her.Also the villains motives are ridiculous, there is no feasible reason for them wanting to take over the world. And it seems that the suicide squad are the reason for the villain and they are both dealt with with bombs. BOMBS. They could have called in the Air Force to Nuke them and everyone could have gone back to their cells.The action scenes were lame and too easy for the squad. The enemies were literally black faceless goblins and even Quinn's bat could decapitate them easily so why even use guns. The music was overused and the CGI and editing were terrible also.Character development was so poor most of the squad besides Deadshot and Harley barely got screen time and zero development. I mean if they decided to do an everyone dies situation then no one would care and I'd probably laugh.I would not say this movie is better than BvS but it is probably more fun to watch. So far DC have killed superman and ruined Batman who by the way was also irrelevant in this movie and now one of the easiest ways to redeem themselves is wasted.This movie is doing great at the box office only because that all they ever cared about.Money. The trailer gave away all the good parts of the film and so the rest was just boring crap. I'm happy Geoff Johns is in charge now because if Justice League ends up like this then DC is well and truly done.Overall I'm only giving this movie a 4/10 because of Harley Quinn, and Deadshot didn't suck too bad. Poor character development. Poor Editing and CGI. Zero Plot line. Decent Acting but Terrible Action. I'm not going to tell anyone to watch this or not but go and decide for yourself.I don't know who gave Ayer this movie but until I see a Nolan type movie pretty soon I'm done with DC.",Suicide Squad
2108,herecmesjcky,Meh...,3,5 August 2016,"Very very over hyped. The movie focuses more on Deadshot and Harley Quinn as all other villains fall behind them and are reduced to just a few lines in the entire movie.I'm not even gonna mention the fact, that they felt the need to introduce characters twice in the span of 10 minutes.Instead I'm gonna say this: ""Warner Bros - grow a pair!"". This movie should've been rated R, these villains would have been able to open up so much more, we might've even forgotten about the messy plot and the non-existent characters (xcept Deadshot and Harley). Even more than that they are VILLAINS how can you make a true to comic books movie about villains that don't kill(why are they even considered so bad then)?!??Lastly I'm gonna say some of them aren't even bad morally having in mind that W. Smith is just a father that loves his daughter and admits that he is looking for a chance to redeem himself and become a hero for her... Pyro is already a good guy when we meet him. The Katana girl (don't even remember her name) was good. Basically half of the villains in this movie turn out to be boy scouts.I'm not gonna talk about the story because as I said for me it was non-existent.",Suicide Squad
2109,ethanwebster-27670,Decent,7,6 August 2016,"After the intense hype for the movie after the past six months of advertisement, trailers etc. I was disappointed with the the final result-overall the film was a great film but it could have been better, firstly Margot Robbie played Harley Quinn extremely well in the movie, the psychotic maniac who was madly in love with the joker was played well by this actress, she almost carried the movie the entire time. In addition Will Smith played deadshot reasonably well, I couldn't think of a better actor to play that role to be honest. The plot for the movie was well thought out and the opening introducing all the characters was very well done, however it did take a while for me personally to get into the film (a good half an hour or so) but I wasn't disappointed. The reason I gave the movie a rating of 7 was for two solid reasons, firstly and most importantly, the trailers showed a lot of joker action, I was really looking forward to Jared Leto's performance as the joker as I wanted to see how well he compared to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker in 2008 The Dark Knight, unfortunately the joker did not appear as often as I thought as the trailers showed more of the joker, I liked the way Jared played the joker, in a physco way but I really liked the laugh as it came off as a bit insane and over the top. Having said that, the way the film ends brings back the joker and I am looking forward to see the joker in the upcoming movie Justice League in 2017. The other reason I gave it a 7 was because I did not like the way killer croc looked. I really enjoyed the action in this movie and I recommend everyone to watch it, I thought every character had a part to play in the movie, overall Suicide Squad was a great movie, if you enjoy action pact, plot twisting madness then I would say this movie is a must watch.",Suicide Squad
2110,tomislavazuvela,most terrible story line ever,2,25 December 2016,"Actually there is no story line here. Scenes seem all just mashed up, like you took 5 different movies who would have been good if reviewed alone, and you just glued together some scenes from each of the 5 movies and tried to make a new one; ending up with obviously horrible movie. Only scenes worth watching were joker/harley ones. I later rewatched them all including some deleted scenes; only to find out they only seemed good when you watched them in that horrible movie, but in reality they weren't; jared leto, althrough i really like him as joker and i am looking forward to seeing him more, didn't really do a good job: he was kind of forcing it too hard and you can really see it's bad acting which ruins everything. So, movie overall is terrible, but it hooked me on the whole joker and harley love story and i am looking forward to their own movie (with fixed jareds acting). And of course, margot robbie did an incredible job and i would rate her acting 10/10!!!",Suicide Squad
2111,traviseholley,Definitely worth watching,10,5 August 2016,"The formula for this movie doesn't match any formula I've ever seen in any movie. It wasn't plot centric because the plot was character driven. Keep your eye on the character interplay if you want to track the plot.I enjoyed the characters. I enjoyed the chemistry between the actors and actresses in this film. Each character was believable and real. People looking for a specific portrayal of a specific characteristic should read the comic books and stick with that. It is a fast paced, fun movie. The differences in the people, the way they interacted with each other kept the plot moving forward.There were no two dimensional characters in this movie. The director did a very impressive job splitting your attention ten different ways and still maintaining a central theme.",Suicide Squad
2112,csheff-99615,Lifetime comic book fan that is 100% satisfied,10,5 August 2016,"PROLOGUE: Here's the deal guys, I don't know what movie the critics are watching, but please go see this one for yourself. We went six people deep and not a single person was let down. Two people have texted me tonight, knowing i'd write this review, telling me it's their new favorite super hero film. I CANNOT understand how all of these film critics thought the ending of Guardians of the Galaxy (where our hero tries to have a dance off with the massively underdeveloped villain followed by unexplained magic stuff winning the day followed by a dancing cartoon baby tree) was brilliant, but try to claim there was anything wrong with the way this film went down. The similarities are staggering (besides the stupid dance off) So lemme spin it for you. First off, this movie is FUNNY. It doesn't make fun of itself the way some superhero films do with their comedy, just the characters themselves are funny, and we get a fun bit of profile on all of them early on (besides two and they were both pretty underused (gripe #1)) I LOVED that the presence of The Bat and The Joker were background elements, sort of like two different myths in the villain world that are on opposite ends of the bad spectrum. This is definitely not their movie, but I appreciate their inclusion (not putting them into this world they helped create would've been dumb). If you couldn't tell from the trailer Deadshot and Harley get most of the screen time, and honestly deservedly so. This was Will Smith at the top of his game, he was easily one of my favorite characters to watch the whole film. Everyone else (besides those two I mentioned) get their screen time, their action, and their jokes in. I was surprised at how much use they got out of these characters, especially considering how much the reviews bagged on that very subject. (pro tip, if you wants loads of extra backstory on these characters beyond what the film gives, I recommend comic books. The backstory exists in spades.) My second gripe (and my ONLY other gripe) is that while the source of the conflict was a pleasant surprise (given that the trailers don't spoil any of it) the actual villain was pretty mysterious and we don't get many answers on that subject. It's just one of those things you, as a viewer in a superhero movie where magic and superpowers exist, are going to have to take at face value. For the most part the villain basically exists to bring these characters together and provide action when necessary, but we're given a pretty cool climactic sequence because of it. TL:DR - I'm a comic book fan, I'm an action movie fan, I'm an ensemble fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's funny, the action is dope, the acting is great, Amanda Waller was perfect, the Joker cameos (because they are basically cameos) were fun and gave Harley's character some extra spice, the Batman Cameos were short but solid, and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS for some extra stuff : ) Favorite characters: - Deadshot - El Diablo - Amanda Waller",Suicide Squad
2113,shannonsc-55963,KIler Croc,7,17 August 2016,"While I loved almost everything about this movie, there was one character in the film that I didn't like. Well it turns out that Killer Croc was depicted as a stereotypical black male. With his choice of words and what he wanted to have in his cell after the mission was done. This was my least favorite character due to the lack of depth and knowledge. Otherwise the film was really good. I also could have done without the pointless slow motion...that seemed to last about 5 minutes and wasn't needed in the film. But between Headshot, Harley Quinn and the Joker well done, those characters kept the movie interesting and fun to watch. P.s. Director: Not all black people watch BET.",Suicide Squad
2114,brooks-63163,absolutely adored it- new favorite movie!,10,14 August 2016,"I watched the movie last night and i can not stop thinking about it!I honestly recommend everyone to go see it, it was just so good!!This movie is by far my favorite and i don't think it deserves all the criticism its receiving. I believe the acting was on point and believable The story line was easy to follow and left you wanting more!The trailer was one of the best i've ever seen, mainly because it doesn't give the whole movie way, it gets really annoying when they do that!

I mean, I can't understand why they don't like it that much. I think everyone should vote 10\10. In the end everyone has there taste. The actors, story, songs and everything it just perfect! I really like ""Heathens-Twenty One Pilots"" I mean you can't stop listening to that song. I haven't forgot Harley and Joker love it was totally amazing !",Suicide Squad
2116,Charlie_1204,What happened to D.C Movies?!,4,14 August 2016,"I was waiting for this even more than Civil War. I liked Civil War, but this one.... Let me start by saying that Margot Robbie was great, she was the character that saved this movie of being worse. Will Smith was OK, but i don't think he was the right choice; Deadshot is supposed to be this serious dark hit-man, but they turn him into a ""funny"" character. That's the main problem with this movie, they try so hard to be funny like Marvel. People criticized Batman V Superman for being dark and humorless, which i think is ridiculous, so they copied Marvel, WHY?! They stole the essence of the film, with the PG-13 rating and stupid jokes; i'd rather to see a dark movie than this ""trying so hard to be Marvel"". Now, the characters: the villain is beyond horrible, just a one- dimensional ""witch"" with her brother trying to destroy the world by no reason with the giant spectacle in the city like a Ghostbuster's scene. The villain is not the only thing, the character of Diablo is not good, with a terrible backstory and racist Mexican dialogue. Slipknot, was a complete useless and wasted character, he's killed 5 minutes after he appears, WOW! Boomerang and Katana are horrible too, with no development; well Katana had a backstory, a cliché story of her dead husband, really forced. Also the backstory of Deadshoot, his daughter, was so forced, i didn't buy any of that; and when he is about to shoot the villain, we see the girl ""talking"" to Deadshoot saying to him not to shoot, i mean seriously!! In the beginning of the film, when Deadshoot is about to shoot Batman, the girl stops him, which makes sense, but not in that final scene, if he doesn't kill the villain, the world ends, simple as that!! The daughter's backstory was very forced. Now, the most anticipated thing of this movie: The Joker; wow, he was horrible. I can see if people like Jared Leto's performance, but it din't work for me; that EMO and gangsta style was bad, really bad; and he is not even important in the film, with an appearance of not even 10 minutes. Harley Quinn and Deadshoot make this movie worth the ticket, they saved this for being worse as i just said, and the relationship of Harley and Joker was good and charming, but the movie as a whole, is disappointing and mediocre. What a shame, for a movie that could have been great.",Suicide Squad
2117,all-we-knowisfalling,Great film for everyone not just DC fans,10,4 August 2016,"A very good movie that does explore the characters in some detail. The only gripe I had was the amount of screen time Will Smith has. Although he is great as Deadshot, they should have kept the jokers scenes in and cut a few of his. Leto will be an awesome joker in the future and I'm hoping will make an appearance in the solo Batman movie! Worth a watch for not only us DC fans but everyone! Not sure the film should have been a 15 rating though. Although I agree on an R rating for something like Suicide Squad, the amount of gore and violence etc. Didn't really warrant it! The minor cameos in the movie shows that DC is building a good universe for its upcoming movies!",Suicide Squad
2118,schrischase,What would have happened if I gave weight to the critics.....,10,5 August 2016,"I would have missed a phenomenal movie. I find the critic reviews enigmas. They have been right and we know there are some very good critics, but their just missing it on this one. I just can't imagine walking out of this movie thinking it was worse than any movie on RT at 50% (almost 2X better than SS).. So Hellboy 2 at 85% RT is just on another level compared to Suicide Squad if weight put on that score. I mean not even close...85 to 29 ? I'm in my mid 40's and no fanboy. That was a great movie! Visuals, Cool Action, Mystery, Atmosphere, overall feel and texture was great. I thought the appropriate amount of time was dedicated to the appropriate people and honestly came out with my cheeks hurting from smiling :) The Critics just dropped the ball on this one. Completely dropped the ball...to the tune of 29% Highly Recommend.",Suicide Squad

I am a fan of both DC and Marvel movies, and the so-called ""competition"" between the two rival studios will only benefit us moviegoers because it challenges filmmakers to be bigger and better. I cannot think of any movie that I have seen in recent years that exuded such swagger, confidence, attitude, intelligence, grit and, yes, even heart like ""Suicide Squad."" While the villain is somewhat generic, the chemistry between the cast members is electric and worth the price of admission alone. All of the DC Easter eggs and surprise cameos made my head spin. This film continues the development of the DC extended universe, and it rightly sets the stage for the upcoming ""Justice League"" movie. Ignore the critics and the naysayers.

We saw them drive us into emotions and feelings , but here ? you wish you are a 5 years kid so you can ignore all the stupid conversations and the strange things they do. I really don't blame them coz the main problem is that DC started while ago spending less money on there movies to get a higher profit Superman vs Batman was the beginning , suicide squad and also we can know exactly what we will see in League of justice that its not better than these two Please stop ruin everything we love coz of your greed.",Suicide Squad
2122,ismailibrahim-99099,"It's an all round good movie, but could have used a couple of tweeks",8,3 August 2016,"The third installment in the DCEU proved it's worth (For Dc Fans), beating both its predecessors by miles. I'll start with the Pros of the movie.1.The acting in Suicide Squad was spot on, Will Smith was my highlight performance of the movie,perfect as Deadshot, managing to capture both aspects of the character, the hit-man and the Father. Margrot Robbie was just amazing as Harley Quinn, and i'm really excited about what DC will do with her if she gets a solo movie. Viola Davis as Amanda Waller just steals the show every time she is on screen.2. The story was good, as it really made all members of the squad interact with each other in so many ways, relating both to their Criminal lives and their personal ones.3. The Action sequences are very good, especially the ones having Deadshot in them.Moving on to the Cons:1.The movie was too predictable,when i enter a movie i wanna be curious about whats gonna happen later in the movie, but with Suicide Squad i really didn't find that, as the ending was very predictable.2.Too little screen time for the Joker.I really find it annoying that they didn't give much screen time for the Joker, one of the reasons why i wanted to see this movie was because of the Joker, as i wanted to see if Jared Letos performance could top or equal that of Heath Ledger's performance, but i really couldn't as i wasn't shown enough of him to make my overall verdict about him.3.Very Weak villain, as you saw in most of the trailers and the large media campaign WB gave to this movie, they focus very little about the villain. The final showdown between the Squad and the bad guy wasn't that interesting, as the villain was defeated very easily. Overall Verdict: It's a good movie and is definitely worth your time, it is better by miles than Man of Steel and Batman V Superman. The movie could have had a better villain, more screen time for the joker, but all in all it is a good movie and i am certain most DC fans will like it.",Suicide Squad
2123,Deloreanis,Worst. Heroes. Ever. more like Worst. Movie. Ever. (not really),1,25 November 2016,"I have exaggerated saying that is the worst movie ever, which is not a really accurate description to this movie, but it is surely in the list of worst movies ever. Same amount of jokes as an average marvel super flick has, and they're not funny. Don't blame David Ayer (completely, he may have a little bit of blame, but I'm not sure), blame the executives and people in suits behind this abomination. So here you have my list of things that structured this disaster:1-NO SQUAD:(Potential Spoilers, maybe) It is called Suicide Squad, and there is a group supposed to be the squad, well... it is not. There is other group in the movie supposed to be the military squad and it also isn't a squad. There are no groups in the film, when it is supposed that the central theme of the movie is a SQUAD. There might be some chemistry between the members of the self-called ""SQUAD"", but it did not seemed to show up at some point.2-MUSICAL POLLUTION: Classic recognizable songs, one after another, and it doesn't stop until the end of the movie (which not tops my brand new imaginary list of most ridiculous and stupid moments in film). I guess the intention of the songs is to represent somehow an inner struggle in the characters, or to ambient the moment properly, or maybe there was another intention and it didn't work. So, classic popular song #1 starts, then classic popular song #2 starts right in the middle and this one goes on for more time, but another classic popular song (#3) gets in the way, and it is annoying (at least for me and some other reviewers, not so many -by the way-). This musical formula goes on and on and on during the whole movie.3-UNNECESARY JOKER:(Potential Spoilers, maybe) Jared Leto's joker is something else. I won't spoil it for anyone. I'll just say it is BAD. The screen time he got was way too short too judge him and analyze his performance. He is not related to the plot, at all. 4-EDITION: Quick editing, weird editing, misplaced editing. I'm not a pro-editor, but I'm aware of what is right and what is not. I have not edited a full length film, but I understand it is a tough task, that doesn't excuses Mr. John Gilroy, who has edited a large amount of good films.5-CHARACTER ACTIONS: This might be similar to the first issue. There are only three characters that get developed, in the most superficial sense of the word, and as an audience we are supposed to invest ourselves into the feelings of these characters, and such thing does not happen. Floppy characters, some of them were supposed to be insane, but it didn't seems to be the case, some of them were supposed to be insanely aggressive, but that wasn't the case.",Suicide Squad
2124,burnzmat,It was good but could have been better,7,29 August 2016,I am speaking as a fan of dc and a fan of movies themselves.for starters i do suggest seeing the movie i thought it was good but it could have been better.the movie to me seemed a bit off and out of balance and that was mainly due to editing.i would be watching a scene and then out of nowhere the person could move to a complete other side of the room it feels non consistent.another issue i had was with the commercials and TV spots that have been shown to us throughout the year because it doesn't fit the movie how in the trailers it was packed with action and felt like an upbeat anti-hero movie.while the movie itself felt more of a drama stle than full action.it is also very offputting when you see content in the trailers that isn't even in the movie or were changed i.e not a lot of joker and the bar scene.but i mean overall it was good with the acting and actors soundtrack and good scrip. i suggest to rent the movie first then descide if you want to buy.,Suicide Squad

But then I've came to realise that these are the reviews from fans of DC rival comic-verse. So I request you all to please ignore such reviews.Now coming to the topic, I am a movie enthusiast and would like to share that the movie was very good overall. Tone of the movie was dark, however it also had very good humor added to it (unlike Batman v Superman). The effects were good, the acting, the story-line and the pace with which the story-line went, although for first couple of minutes, the story was rushing a bit, but then it slowed down and started getting ""really, really ""interesting""!' I would not like to spoil the movie much, but *spoilers alert*, some of the scenes by Joker, Margot Robbie and Will Smith received great applause from the audience, and then obviously there was this Flash scene. I would grade the film, a solid A+ and give out a score of 9 out of 10!",Suicide Squad

2127,marilouli,Enjoyed it! Great scenes but... cut!,10,12 August 2016,"Let's get this one straight, it is a superhero movie adapted from a comic book and trailers tend to 'overeact' when it comes to these kind of movies. I mean Marvel's Civil War was the same for me, so much hype about it but it actually disappointed me as well (big Marvel fan). Suicide Squad suffers from various issues that already half the planet has pointed out. Yes, it could have been better! Concerning the characters, I also believe that if Jared Leto was given more screen time, the story could have been more coherent and have a bad-ass villain combo. An Enchantress/Joker co-op would make more sense. Really didn't care for Boomerang or Slipknot's head exploding everywhere... okay that was kinda funny. Joker's screen- time made me sum it up to: ""Ah... Baby where are you? Baby get ready I'm coming to get you! Baby I'm outside playing with my helicopter! OOps Baby they did it again and shot us both down. Bye-bye. The end."" Leto's performance was great. He is the 21st century Joker addressing the trends of the 21st century. The character's set up was marvelous. The tattoos with the Easter eggs and the teeth made him a unique one, more modern. After all, he is crazy and doesn't care about how he looks. I wish I could have seen the extent of his inner psychological turmoil and not only the relationship between him and Harley. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was also great. Knowing that the crucial scene of her origin with Mr. J is slightly different from the New 52 Suicide Squad#7 added more agency to Harley, giving her a choice on her life's outcome, blaming no-one but herself. The chemical vat scene was one my favorite. The dive, Joker's internal conflict on whether to save her or not and the ""Desire becomes Surrender. Surrender becomes Power"" got me. Capturing their ambivalent relationship,though, and not only the caring part could have given a more clear picture of their psychology. The movie favored them more than the rest (Deadshot too) as well. Harley had extra flashbacks and Deadshot more try-to-be-the-hero- daddy scenes. I found that Deadshot's story was a bit strange, trying too much to redeem and justify an assassin by portraying his relationship with his daughter by neglecting Katana (she killed her husband with that demonic sword!). Boomerang did not really make an impression, Killer Croc was indeed 'beautiful' but that's it, Amanda Waller was the Nick Fury wannabe and then there is Rick Flag. I really disliked him. However, I really liked Cara Devigne as The Enchantress. She was good, the costume was awesome, but where was her ""Let's have some fun"" scene? Her story could have been more developed. A simple I kill you because you don't worship me mortal didn't convince me. Nevertherless, despite the confusing story-line and the extended character introduction, it is a decent movie with outstanding performances. I believe that the struggle to present a variety of materials confused things. A stand-alone movie for each character could have saved introductions and focus on new relationships, conflicts and saving the world instead.They are bad guys, why do they agree to do it? 10 years off a life sentence means nothing really. I'm disappointed on the whole cut but I enjoyed it and would like to see it again for a close Easter egg hunting. Plus it featured some great songs and a homage to Alex Ross' iconic painting.",Suicide Squad

Though the remaining characters has a great chemistry and makes the best of what they've got.

If the story of two different cuts being merged into one is true, then the tones must have canceled each other out, because the movie ended up being dull. A lot of the entertainment value is from Will Smith and Margot Robbie as Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Most of the other major characters are visually interesting, but forgettable. Diablo is a walking cliché, being a Mexican-stereotype bad guy who redeems himself in death. Scott Eastwood and Common's characters ended up having no impact on the film at all, and there are a few moments that just don't work. There are some serious moments ruined by poor execution, such as the final battle using slow-motion to the point of boring me.

Rotten Tomatoes was anything but accurate in its description and analysis of this movie. I think their glorified critics need to ask themselves what ever could justify their review of a meagre 22% Packed with just the right amount of excitement and a storyline that though may not blow your brains away, Suicide Squad is anything but mundane. In fact if you've read the comic books, you're in for a treat. Perhaps it's the growing number of superhero fans who have no idea what DC is about, having being force fed marvel's nauseous mix of one liners and clichéd stories. Margot Robbie stands out for her portrayal of Harley, and Jared Leto leaves you wanting for more. Definitely worth your time",Suicide Squad
2134,setsytes,Entertaining and cool scenes in a very meh plot,7,9 August 2016,"THE GOOD - Some critics have complained the movie is like a glorified music video. I feel it's actually at its best when its being the most like a music video. The introductions and backgrounds of the different characters to popular rock songs were perhaps the best parts. The movie has a number of really cool scenes, especially when it came to flashbacks. The Batman scenes were the best, but then I would say that! It's definitely a style over substance film, and it was entertaining and there was a good deal of fun to be had watching it. The scenes themselves were well directed, I think. People complained the Joker wasn't in it as much as advertised, but after reading that I found he was in it more than I expected. It wasn't his film and I don't think he should have been in it any more than he was. I was happy with the amount. As for characters, Deadshot was particularly good (although he should have worn the mask more), and Harley looked really visually striking and cool, and I mean that from the shoulders up at least, and they both acted convincingly. It was clearly a Deadshot and Harley- led film. The film was nice and colourful and I really like that, especially compared to the lack of colour in BvS. I particularly liked Harley's colours and all the neon title and end credits and 'character bios'. THE BAD - Style over substance. Scattered scenes were great, but as for the core plot it was really meh. The villain was kinda interesting to begin but quickly got boring as soon as she went bigtime. Neither the villain nor the stakes grabbed you.The 'sh*t got real' big crisis thing just seemed to suddenly happen, there was zero buildup to it. The later part of the film was worse than the first as, if not for the characters, it became a bit too generic and too CGI- y.The film really needed to be a 15. For a film about villains there was no blood and they went down the boring Marvel-like disposable monsters route. They definitely needed to make it more personable and savage and not so middle-of-the-road in terms of action. It's called the Suicide Squad for goodness sake! I know it was from their point of view and was supposed to make them more sympathetic, but the villains never really seemed villainous. Like, at all. Harley smashed a window and robbed a handbag. Ooooh, we've got a badass over here! No backstabbing, which was what the Suicide Squad was supposed to be about. The whole magic villain thing... it just seemed a bit too soon for the DCEU. It was too out there at this stage. They should have gone with a more grounded villain for the Suicide Squad, because they took the time to ground the members of the Squad themselves. The Squad are not Asgardians. Some of the characters were just too gangsterised (Croc, Diablo, Harley a little, Boomerang a little, and Joker the most egregious). Croc was also too skinny in my opinion, or rather just didn't look as threatening as he should have. He didn't have much to do, though. Next to Joker he was the weirdest seeing 'street'. The Joker's performance was.. okay... decent... neither bad nor great, but mainly because it was hard to take seriously because you were so preoccupied by his daft look. He had different outfits and when it was toned down and looked more Joker-y it was a damn sight better. The more bling he looked the more distracting it was. One outfit in particular. Still, I liked seeing him on screen but didn't want any more of him in that movie.Harley's comic lines (which were nearly ALL her lines) just fell flat. Wryly amusing moments in the film did not come from Harley, who had lines that were trying too hard and were a little cringing. Boomerang was funnier in a more natural way. No actual proper laughs though in the film, but then I didn't really expect or need them. The editing wasn't good in the movie. You could tell they'd had reshoots and shoehorned some DCEU stuff in. The film was messy, like critics said BvS was but I disagreed with. With this you could tell it was more like a network of scenes. The film was clearly more interested in particular scenes than the core plot, which was almost like an afterthought. Weirdly, the film would actually have flowed a lot better if you'd scrapped the core plot and put all the characters and their lives and backgrounds and so forth into a short Netflix series. It could have had a lot less budget and told a better story. As a movie it seemed to be relying way too much on setup and not on payoff.BvS was better.Anyway, yeah. Above all, decent and fun but not a masterpiece by any means. I don't mind if critics give it a 5/10 or whatever, even if personally I would, acknowledging my biases, give it higher. That's fine. What I hate and will always hate is critics who play it up and write about this and other decent (or even mediocre) hyped films being crimes against cinema, as though they're on par with Jack and Jill and Date Movie. Wall Street Journal called Suicide Squad ""an all-out attack on the whole idea of entertainment"". Attention seekers.",Suicide Squad
2135,sinkriv,A cheap parody of the DC universe,1,3 January 2017,"No plot, no wit, no depth, no dialogues. I believe this movie is pretty easy to summarize: it's simply a huge mess. This movie was enormously hyped and was not able to meet the expectations. I had really high hopes for the Joker, as Jared Leto is usually hardly a let-down. However, in this case his portrayal of the Joker was simply ridiculous and over the top. Generally, I feel like every single actor was not on the top of their game. Feels like they adopted their level of acting to the awful movie. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my precious life on this and I regret every single minute of it. Particularly sad, as this comes from a big DC fan. Expected so much more and am clearly disappointed. Pleaso no more of this!",Suicide Squad

Dubbed Task Force X, the criminals unite to battle a mysterious and powerful entity, while the diabolical Joker (Jared Leto) launches an evil agenda of his own. Just watched the movie and it seemed great. Don't know why it got some bad reviews. With that type of characters a movie can't be more interesting. Worth watching. Although the secret mission thing was lame, movie has got a lot more than that. Brilliant soundtrack with great experience.Hope for better movies in the future from Dc, their characters have always been really exciting.

This is a movie where it struggles between trying to be fun while taking itself seriously. It stumbles on all the wrong notes trying to piece together what slim portion of plot there is left wade through. I feel sorry for Will Smith, and some of the other actors as well. It wasn't exactly their fault that, although there were some cringe worthy acting. I wholeheartedly blame David Ayer, the Director and Screenwriter where he lacks both direction and any semblance of writing in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed his previous work in 'Fury' and I am only left to wonder where it all went wrong in Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad
2139,teresinhawolfe,"A little shabby, but not too shabby",6,7 August 2016,"I'll begin with a few strong aspects of the movie. This was an entertaining movie, with a nice colour scheme to boot. I was really digging the bright neon theme! And the soundtrack was alright.The big-bad-guy for this movie, despite having the usual goal of bad guys which mostly involves world domination and other similar things, was entertaining! Visually, pretty cool.Harley Quinn was cute! Could've done without the mediocre back-story, but I like how she's a mixture of silly and psycho.Now for a couple of weak aspects... When I saw the trailer for Suicide Squad, I immediately knew that it wasn't going to be funny. The humour was forced, to say the least. If the theatre had been packed with a bunch of my clones, the after-joke pauses in the movie would have been filled with awkward silences rather than the few dispersed chuckles I'm fairly sure I heard. That's for most of the jokes though. There were a few laugh-worthy moments in the film.The plot was fairly lame, but what do you expect from a movie based off a comic? I mean, there's usually only two teams: the good guys and the bad guys. And, well, they're usually fighting one another. So don't expect anything too profound in that respect, other than the fact that now bad guys are fighting other bad guys for the good guys.Despite these things though, I would probably watch the movie again, even if the writing was perhaps a little awkward and the characters not quite as insane as I would've liked. There were some intriguing moments which I wouldn't mind seeing again.",Suicide Squad

In a panorama film in which both them movies of superheroes as them of any other type is stand out by wanting to innovate, introducing elements original, concepts new to do is more ""refreshing"", more interesting that the previous, with results very interesting from different perspectives (take for example Deadpool, Watchmen, Kick-ass and almost any film of the M.C.U.), is presents this parody of itself. Raised by an interesting home potential, a stylish connection with the universe of DC that started to draw Batman v Superman, and a range of very different characters that offered interesting possibilities (with a cast of almost unbeatable to interpret them), are quickly wasted as the film progresses. The characters lose substance, leaving only some more bearable than others. This film takes the basics of American cinema cliché (stupid dialogue, far-fetched action, exaggerated and ridiculous characters) and compressed it into two appalling hours.",Suicide Squad

Constant flashbacks ruin the flow of the movie and action sequences make absolutely no sense. The director could have done something great with it but instead he delivered two hours of wasted opportunity for everybody involved. For DC readers, I think the main question in your mind will be ""What is the Joker doing here?""

2142,maiteakkermans,a beautiful disaster,8,11 September 2016,"I had heard a lot about the suicide squad and I went to this movie with mixed expectations. Either it would be fantastic or it would be disastrous and after watching it I believe it's both. The story line is very messy and multiple characters are definitely unnecessary, but the casting was perfect. Will Smith did a great job playing Deadshot, Viola Davis made a terrifying Amanda Waller and Joel Kinnaman was a very convincing Rick FLag, but it were Harley Quinn and her Puddin' that made me fall in love with this squad. Also, the soundtrack is amazing! I understand that one would find this movie incredibly corny and a little bit predictable, but I simply loved it in all its weird and twisted glory.",Suicide Squad
2143,gavingraeme,Better Than Expected,7,6 August 2016,"I would like to start by saying I hate Batman Vs Superman. I really do, it is by far one of the worst superheros movies I have ever seen, but that is just me. But this isn't about that movie, but it does make a point of, I am NOT a fanboy. I think DC has had a bad start so far. Onto the review...Suicide Squad was FANTASTIC, by no means perfect, and certainly not a work of art, but a great summer movie and it did its job excellently. This move had plot hole, a weak villain, and some exceptionally cheesy moments, but Jared Leto did well as Joker, not perfect, but well enough where I am intrigued by his take on the Joker and look forward to seeing him be the villain of a DC movie. Will Smith, he was awesome. Made me laugh, not to mention, he had some really cool scenes, and Margot Robbie is exactly what everyone expected to see. As far as characters go, it didn't leave much to be desired (aside from more screen time with Joker, but this movie wasn't about him). Now, his movie is getting bashed by critics, and I can't see why, it isn't perfect, but it is better than Batman Vs. Superman (which it is currently ranked lower than). The reviews from the critics are so illogical at times that one can't help to wonder why (made me think of Birdman). I would also like to address a common critique from the critics, this movie was NOT choppy, but it was VERY rush at moments, an example (no spoilers) is a shot of a helicopter going down. No buildup to it, just falling. It was things like that. Some shots were too fast, and would have benefit from just a 4 or 5 second extension. But this does not make the movie bad. This movie is to me, just a little under Guardian of The Galaxy, because this one lazily jabbed all the characters backstory's in, almost felt like watching a PowerPoint presentation with their introductions. All in all, watch it. It is FUN, it is not Shawshank Redemption, or Heat, but it is a good action movie, not to mention it was very stylish with it's credits. If you don't enjoy comic movies much, this isn't going to change your mind. But it is a fun popcorn flick. Watch it, have fun, and leave it at that. Don't expect anything that puts you in awe, just look for a good time, and you'll have one.",Suicide Squad
2144,ravsehwag,Suicide squad sets a new benchmark of how worst a superhero movie can get.,2,13 August 2016,"With BvS I thought that the Dc Universe is set off to blast the superhero genre with some mind blowing movies but instead they end up making what can only be called as a fan's worst nightmare.Suicide squad is one of those movies ,where you think what the hell did i waste my money on.Jared Leto and Joker the two best things Hollywood can offer at the same time and they couldn't make him a proper sidekick let alone the main villain or should i say a hero as is the case with the other characters.Basically Dc just blew the character of Batman with Dawn of Justice and did the same with Joker's character in suicide squad.The movie lacks any convincement ,it lacks the faith and believe as to why the characters should be together.At a moment,everyone hates everyone suddenly everyone loves everyone without any reason or emotion attached.At one point the Witch's army is the best and at the same time it takes just a few punches to knock its soldiers out.The only thing that helped me to get through this two hours of torture was the music and soundtrack of the movie and ""Harley Quinn"" played by Margot Robbie who is the only person in the movie that does the justice to the character",Suicide Squad
2145,lucasamonteiro-45447,Don't Listen to the Critics,8,8 August 2016,"I find it hard to believe that the critics and I watched the same movie. This is easily the best DC movie since TDK. Everybody is saying that the villain is terrible and Cara Delevingne is a terrible actress which I do not understand at all. She had barely any lines in the movie and was perfectly fine considering the material she was working with. Her performance was nothing amazing but I do not know how critics can sit there and say she was terrible. Everybody makes that same argument about the villain yet in every marvel movie ever (excluding The Avengers) the villain has been 100 times worse. I enjoyed Enchantress for what she was. Jared Leto's performance as The Joker was very refreshing and different. With only about 15 minutes of screen time I still believe that this Joker is the most true to the comics incarnation yet (aside from the way he looks). I enjoyed the fact that he was this big mob boss with businesses etc. Of course there are always going to be the unfair comparisons to Heath Ledger's performance which is obviously very hard to top. I can't say Jared Leto had a better performance because he wasn't in the movie nearly long enough to judge. However, I can say that I enjoyed this version of The Joker far more than Heath Ledger's.In my opinion the characters that steal the show are Deadshot played by Will Smith, Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie and Amanda Waller played by Viola Davis. I even enjoyed Diablo played by Jay Hernandez. Will Smith is extremely charismatic as always and actually makes you feel for him which is strange because he is a villain. Margot Robbie is the definitive live action Harley Quinn; after seeing her performance I cannot see anyone playing the role better. She is straight out of the comics. Viola Davis is one scary woman as Amanda Waller. I would not want to mess with her. I would be more scared of Amanda Waller than I would be scared of Enchantress. In my opinion, she is the main villain of the movie, and her performance is near perfection.As always, do not rely on the critics' opinions when going into a movie. Everyone has their own opinions and it is up to you to form your own. Remember, these are the same critics that said American Hustle was better then The Wolf of Wall Street. The same critics that gave an aggregate score of 73% to the absolutely horrendous Ghostbusters(2016). Please do not listen to the critics.",Suicide Squad
2146,tannerdesterre,DC delivers more fun to match it's darkness.,8,12 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a ton of fun! It's stylish, bad-ass, enjoyable, and like the characters that make up the titular team, is rough around the edges. There are flaws to be sure and some stick out like a sore thumb (lookin' at you totally out of place, eyeroll worthy, slow mo!)...but worse movies have been given better reviews for the same or worse sins. The final battle felt...off...in a lot of ways - perhaps it's because writer/director David Ayer has never really done a big, special effects driven, superhero film before. Perhaps the re-shoots/re-editing the BvS backlash caused did more harm than good? There are some awkward lines and poor deliveries...I can't really put my finger on what happened...there have been reports that there were competing cuts of the film - one more serious and somber and the more ""turn off your brain and have fun"" one we got - perhaps they should have stuck to the plan...although the final conflict did pull me out of the movie a great deal and the latter half is pretty predictable, the film as a whole is not the waste of space some critics or your ""friend who knows film"" might lead you to believe. The cast and their characters are spot on!! Will Smith and Margot Robbie absolutely steal the show as Deadshot and Harley Quinn and I thought Joel Kinnamen gave the usually forgettable Rick Flag quite a bit of depth. The one role no one seems to be talking about that deserves to be is Viola Davis as Amanda Waller; she is stone f-ing cold and totally perfect to the characters source material! Also; Jai Courtney! I actually liked Jai Courtney! I thought they did a good job of introducing this huge group of main DC players and showing us their back stories without getting bogged down. The plot as a whole is very by the numbers, but that's in keeping with the comics! The whole concept and the group assembled is such a cool idea, but what to do with them always seems to be a rough point. There are lots of by the numbers films that are still enjoyable and this is one of them. Oh! And that scene we've seen of them sitting in a bar and having drinks from the trailers? My god it's good! It is just such a damn good scene!!! Now, let's address the elephant in the room - Jared Leto's Joker... I thought he was awesome! For many audiences Jack Nicholson will always be The Joker and for others he will always be Heath Ledger...but for many, Leto will not be The Joker. But for me, he was! Seemingly based off Brian Azzarello and Lee Bermejo's JOKER graphic novel and Grant Morrison's BATMAN R.I.P. - he is less anarchist and gangster, and more professional psychopath. Also, I liked that he had consumed henchmen that were a part of his crew and not just expendable accessories. He actually reminded me of a modern meth and coke addled version of Cesar Romero's Joker from the 60's TV show...and I mean that in a very good way! I can't wait to see more of him! Like Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice before it, this will not be for everyone - but I continue to be very excited about what DC is doing over its peers. Namely; taking risks and not playing it safe. Much like Batman v Superman, my suspicion is there will be a directors cut on Blu-Ray and that will be the definitive version. Which to some might sound like a short coming - but I see it as more of a good thing! There is a vindictive side of me that would address the negativity for this movie by asking ""But...is this not what you wanted though?"" After the reception of the first two DCEU films, it's no surprise we were given a very ""Marvel"" feeling DC film...and yet that apparently still isn't good enough for critics and some audiences...which is all very disappointing on many levels. Suicide Squad does a great job of keeping DC's now trademark darker tone while lightening the mood considerably! My advice? It's definitely worth a watch, just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride!! 8/10",Suicide Squad

So I request you all to please ignore such reviews.Now coming to the topic, I am a movie enthusiast and would like to share that the movie was very good overall. Tone of the movie was dark, however it also had very good humor added to it (unlike Batman v Superman). The effects were good, the acting, the story-line and the pace with which the story-line went, although for first couple of minutes, the story was rushing a bit, but then it slowed down and started getting ""really, really ""interesting""!'

2152,fsromes,Suicide Squad Review!,7,8 August 2016,"The Suicide Squad was released and is among us. Bringing a lot of expectation and pressure on his back, suicide squad is a movie with a simple story, with interesting characters (however complicated of working in a group), with a tone more fun - fun, the movie actually comes with the order to entertain And enjoy the viewer - and who's not afraid to use a lot of pop songs, really many, to tell his story.Straight out the movie's just throwing everything I saw in the trailers (except what was cut off, he has several things that have been cut off), since beginning got a great sense of humor and action, always accompanied by music. In the meantime, a little bit of wind-up or complexity would have made the most remarkable experience. Maybe, a road map and a more elaborate assembly (a problem of the film, he stays without timing sometimes because of her) that helped this script would have brought us a long more complete. There are reports that the script was written in just 6 weeks, what's a little obvious by the presence of a few clichés and simple solutions of script.However, all who are or have been to the movies, they want to see the squad. Well, all the characters are really very well, some have more emphasis (Harley Quinn and Deadshot), other grow during the long (El Diablo), others lose a little bit of space in the movie and some are lost - the case of Enchantress, she It is well presented, but when the film starts to walk, she don't follow.In the case of the cameos. Batman was only used to boost the squad, both in history as in marketing. And the Joker of Jared Leto? You could say that it was a cameo, maybe he's 15 minutes of screen, only used as a tool of script in the history of Harley Quinn, the clown it was character that had more outtakes - Leto said you could make a movie of the joker With the recorded material -, the film was the squad, but the marketing was abusive on top of it. But, let's wait for more.In conclusion, suicide squad is a movie a lot of fun, which could have renewed the sub-genre (""heroes"") and broken paradigms, unfortunately didn't make it. Go check out simply you can see the Harley Quinn, Deadshot, etc, in action with an incredible soundtrack, you don't have what to say.It's hard to even give a note to the movie, because I had a great time, but taking to the technical side, is flawed.

Everything unveils quickly and you will be sucked in before even realizing. I would recommend this movie to everyone who is able to see it. Margot Robbie did exceptional, everyone fell in love with her, Will Smith was just being him which is the best he could do for the role of Deadshot. Cara had an important roll, great again.

2156,alexiaamoriello,The Antithesis of Batman v Superman,6,2 August 2016,"Despite the fact that Zack Snyder is credited as an executive producer of Suicide Squad, David Ayer's film is essentially the antithesis of Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Whereas Snyder's film was overstuffed, dragged out, and took itself too seriously, Ayer's film is nearly the polar opposite. Suicide Squad nails the concept of an ensemble cast. Each character is given nearly equal amounts of screen time, and every character is given enough depth in order to stand out and keep the film interesting. Normally comic book adaptations try to cram too many characters into any given film, but Suicide Squad gets it right. Similarly, most comic book adaptations suffer from an extended running time, allowing the film to feel boring and painfully slow at times. However, Suicide Squad is wildly fast-paced and never seems to have a dull moment. A 130-minute running time felt more like 90 minutes. In addition, the film boats a spectacular soundtrack, which really contributes to the fast-paced nature of the film and serves to keep things fun. However, one could argue that the film's fast pace and nonstop action serve to distract viewers from the numerous flaws lurking within the film. Perhaps the biggest difference between Snyder's film and Ayer's film is the fact that Suicide Squad doesn't take itself too seriously. That point is made perfectly clear early on in the film when each character is introduced in quick, flashy montages. With that said, this is a film that doesn't want to be taken too seriously. If you are going to nitpick the film or compare it to previous works, you most likely will walk away unhappy. However, if you do not take the film too seriously then it truly is a fun time. Suicide Squad manages to strike the perfect balance between darkness and lightheartedness, something that previous DC adaptations lacked. While the film benefited from a pretty stellar marketing campaign, the marketing may have been misleading seeing as the Joker doesn't have much of a presence in the film. Nonetheless, this is probably for the best because the Joker was quite possibly the worst aspect of the film. The costume design is just atrocious and turns the Joker into a parody of himself. While Jared Leto provides a satisfyingly menacing performance, the strength of his performance is hindered by his physical appearance. The real showstoppers here are Margot Robbie and Will Smith. While Robbie's performance is likely to face plenty of criticism due to this being the first live- adaptation of Harley Quinn, I truly cannot think of an actress more perfect for the role. She remarkably captures the contrast between Harley Quinn and Harleen Quinzel. Meanwhile, Will Smith steals nearly every scene he's in and his comedic-timing is absolutely effortless. While Suicide Squad may not be perfect, it's refreshing to have a DC adaptation that doesn't take itself too seriously. Suicide Squad is also refreshing for those unhappy with the lack of diversity in comic book adaptations, Will Smith even pointed out during the premiere how diverse the cast is. It's also refreshing to have a film that focuses on the villains, because after a while the hero stories just become repetitive and dull. In a sense, Suicide Squad is DC's answer to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy – a fun, action-packed adventure that humanizes the bad guys and features a killer soundtrack. As long as viewers don't overanalyze and nitpick the film, this is guaranteed to be the most fun viewers have at a DC film.",Suicide Squad
2157,xandora-80921,(SPOILER FREE)Amazing. Ignore critics.,8,2 August 2016,"First, i think something is up, critic ratings are mediocre, audience is good, 8.5 out of 6,000 reviews from audience. Its set up, this movie is fantastic. Will Smith (Deadshot) and Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) are great. But Cara Delevingnes Enchantress is the ultimate ""adversary"" . She is beautiful and her acting is so well done. The story is great, the third act is a little bit screwy, but has a great finale. A bit messy to be honest, but in all a fun roller-coaster from start to finish. The casting, pacing, acting, story, and fun factor are all there and well. Its a summer blockbuster at its best. I would extremely recommend watching this. Best Dc movie since Dark Knight. And im not a DC fanboy, i love marvel. Civil war was great. Hated Xmen Apocalypse, and loved deadpool. Im not being bias, im giving a honest true review. 8.5/10.",Suicide Squad
2158,corradonikolas,DC takes a step forward,10,7 August 2016,Now normally Dc movies are boring or the actors are not that good but Suicide Squad is the best movie i have ever seen. It is well worth your time and despite what critics said the actors were great and the characters that were played had a excellent part and should have a way better rating and is by far my favorite movie of all time and destroys Deadpool. The character you will want to see the most is Harley Quinn and the Joker. They had outstanding parts and Jared Letto played a perfect Joker and Margot Robbie played a perfect part. And this is Will Smiths best performance of all time and beats Batman Vs Superman. Harleys voice switches from American to a normal Harley but it plays out perfect. So do not listen to the critics and just watch the amazing movie.,Suicide Squad
2159,yeahthatguy,Never listen to the critics,8,3 August 2016,"I'm going to say it, I listened to the critics. I knew it was wrong thing to do because when I read the critiques I get caught up into it but truly the film was amazing. A definite must see in 3D, IMAX if your lucky. This action pack, star studded lineup demonstrated that DC Comics was not ready to rest after ""critically panned"" Batman vs. Superman. With the highly payola Marvel critics bashing another DC Film, this one was not uncalled for. Ayer displayed a fresh new look on villains, not the best heroes, but somehow cooler than most. With graphics to die for and a soundtrack to live, the film truly display a cast so fun to watch. Smith (Deadshot) and Robbie (Harlequin) won in this film rather than their flop, Focus, displaying their versatility as actors. Delevingne (Enchantress/June) showed us how modelling again wasn't destined for her entire future. I loved her double act between the demonic possessed villain and her human character. The Joker (played by Leto) was mixed amongst the crowd, but as much as I knew it was big shoes to fit after the Oscar winning performance from late Heath Ledger, to be honest I didn't hate it. He obviously brought a different take on the Joker. A more psychotic rather than manipulative tone to his character. Wasn't as much of him in the film, because we know that there is more to come. But you will either love or hate him.There were parts that I knew weren't needed and I'd happily point them out on a second viewing. The plot was a messy plot, but again I'd say at times you could be lost but still catch up if that makes sense. You'd have to be super dumb to not what is happening, but also super smart to know they had some messy hiccups. Overall I found the film very enjoyable despite the early hate. It does open up the question will these unlikely heroes take a cameo appearance in the next DC films? But to be honest, I wouldn't mind watching Suicide Squad any time.",Suicide Squad
2160,abhinavpawar,Not At All What The Critics Claim!,9,5 August 2016,"**********This review may contain spoilers******************Director – David Ayer Soundtrack/Score – Steven Price Executive Producer – Zack Snyder Cinematography – Roman VyasanovThis movie was so close to getting a 10/10 but, the egregious portrayal of the joker hold it off back which I will expand later. Contemporarily, the critics have been hammering on this movie chiefly to the fact that Ayer's 'Flashback-Present' way of narrating is a little obfuscating for which isn't as a matter of fact. On the grounds that, this new way actually is convenient to this movie as it flows with it. The Flashback's are introduced at ideal and exquisite times. As it expands and explicates the movie at the same time.This Movie was well-nighly perfect. But the Joker's portrayal {Not Performance} was awful. It was the one 'Not adopted from the Comic Books'. This persona of the Joker played by Jared Leto brings 'superfluous' menace and craziness to his character. He's too concerned bout' his girl rather than threats like..Batman which is contradictory to the comics and the joker, played by Heath Ledger where he is some real enigmatic physcopath who is always one step ahead. I expected a Heath Ledger with more Menace and Action.All characters of the movie where perfectly played. When the Task Force X enters and moves throughout the city it plays as a silent thing which actually plays out like a horror film. Also during the interaction of the squad with the Enchantress at the end, the flashbacks were intense. Every character gets to show-off at at least one point of a time The score was good nothing beast like Hans Zimmer. The action scenes were also cool. I would recommend this movie 'Despite What The Critics Claim!!'",Suicide Squad
2161,handae-60595,"honestly, disappointed again",4,3 August 2016,"SPOILER ALERT honestly, marvel have many weak villain but this one by dc make all previous marvel villain looks better. a goddess 6000++ years old, huge power. lose because of slash on the chest by Harley, that is one of the most idiotic climax of villain lost, what the hell man. a little mixed feeling bout the joker, like the laugh but i don't really enjoy punk like joker. I can see the similarity with the Nicholson version, not in terms of character but the background. both seems like having a background as a mafia ? but Nicholson a little bit classy, while Jared letto is the thug look one. I do like diablo, he's kinda preachy but the look and power looks awesome. crocs is funny. oh my God the enchantress, she have cool looks ( the dark skinned one, not the bright and beauty, i feel really strange and cringe seeing a pretty enchantress as villain ) yet the climax is horrible. most enjoyable scene ? watching 10 second flash capture boomerang, that flash looks really cool.﻿",Suicide Squad
2162,chanhyuncho,Suicide Squad?? Morelike Suicide DCU,1,3 August 2016,"If you expect this movie to be a great fusion of picaresque and superhero genre, you are wrong. This is really a desperate attempt from WB and DC to revive the dying DCU, so they decided to copy what they think makes marvel movies such a success. A PG13 lighter atmosphere and add some comedy. Really? is this what DC thinks people like watch Marvel movies for? Well if they really wanted to be successful like a marvel movie, they should try to make something like Deadpool. Rated R, some blood and anti-hero stuff. As usual DCU completely missed thing that make Marvel movie successful. A good script that makes sense. This is just a movie that introduces less popular DC characters nothing more nothing less. The whole movie is like ""This guy is Deadshot he shoots guns! This guy is Killer croc, he is scaly! Here is katana she is for all weeaboos! We have more than Batman and Superman you know."" When all the introduction is done, half of the movies is done. And the rest is just rushed plot and really bad PS3 level CG and action to fill up the rest of the time. In the name of bad script, bad CG, bad action. A trinity of fail makes this makes Dawn of Justice look like Citizen Kane. And that is no compliment. Such a shame as it had elements that could have been an innovative superhero movie. But just like dawn of justice, it has been wasted and it will never see the light again.",Suicide Squad
2163,LetsTalkwGJ,Enjoyable but not perfect,7,3 August 2016,"Just watched the Midnight premier and here are my quick thoughtsWhat I LikedMargot Robie was excellent as Harley Quin, I was expecting it to be more of a Joker and Harley movie but Will Smith carries the movie well as Deadshot, he is more or less the leader....Jared Leto's Joker..... it starts off pretty great, but the more they show him and what his motives are (which I still don't know) the more you start questioning whether or not you like him, not sure if thats a good thing or not... What I did not LikeIntroduction to each character was rushed and thus there is minimal or little character development. You just get dished out a spec sheet of who they are and then expect to feel for them using flash backs... which works for some characters but definitely not all of them, and you'll know which ones after seeing the movie. The Villain was bad (no pun intended), half of the villains team gets randomly shoved into the movie without any back story. When I say team, I mean one out of the two antagonists... to vaguely put it without spoiling anything. Some of the lines and dialog felt out of place.... again, can't say without spoiling. Lots more to talk about but those are my quick no-spoiler thoughts. Honestly, would give this a 6.5 but 7 will suffice.",Suicide Squad
2164,olivergustavssons,One of the worst,4,3 August 2016,"Joyless action scenes and uninteresting characters as destroying what could have been an excellent action comedy . This here is not good enough in 2016Unfortunately comprises the entire first hour of verbal cockfight to emphasize how tough everyone is , they play certainly not following any rules , they are real men ( even the women ) . A better film could have let the insults bounce between the figures and give the dialogue momentum, and then turn on the conflicts and build cohesion. Now everything hangs freely. No call leads to another.In fact, when the great supernatural threat would emerge the actors to change lines with each other , or play completely different super villains , but the story would be significantly affected. Get things done based on the characters, they just happen . It actually is character -driven foundation laid in flashbacks dripping with sentimentality. Why should we care about group dynamics and drama as the characters themselves do not? Not even entertainment violence is something up to much . The action scenes are trimmed in joyless 2010 's of ways: fast and confusing, with no sense of time , place or choreography.The only thing that holds together the film is Will Smith and Margot Robbie . Robbie is , in the worst comic book spirit of sexuality but she seems to have fun when she wields his baseball bat and hatch one- liners . Smith has a generic Will Smith 's role , with generic motivation - he wants to prove to his daughter that he was not only a murderer , but may be OK . Fortunately , he has enough charisma to sell it."" Suicide Squad "" could have been action-comedy that saved the DC Comics movie universe from his own lack of humor. So it was not . It is not enough to dull dialogue and environments they bought when there was a sale on broken cities of the backdrop shop. It is this kind of films that gives nonsense bad reputation.",Suicide Squad
2165,littlemissrandomerbbz,Good for what was given,7,3 August 2016,"*Spoiler Free*Have to start by giving credit to Viola Davis, Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto. The poor direction and dialogue given by Ayer is clear, faults which could have been solved during writing or could have been overlooked if it wasn't for the embarrassing editing. Nevertheless, these four actors did they're best with what they were given. There is no doubt in my mind that Viola Davis stole the show for me. Although there were times where her lines seemed corny and lacked the class portrayed by Ms. Davis, her delivery was solid and she was the closest thing to the comic figure that we could have hoped for. Will Smith again showed everyone why he is such a successful actor, strong presence and ability to lead the cast was evident. However, his character plot let him down. Will Smith seemed to be playing Will Smith, not deadshot. There was the witty commentary and one-liners, which we have come to know with Will Smith, but his character did not develop and did not ever push any boundaries to showcase Will's diversity. I expected Margot Robbie to steal the show, but she simply wasn't given her opportunity to.Some of her dialogue,was again,corny. The adverts portrayed her as this strong woman, but quite frankly, she is just depicted as some eye candy and had no real depth to her character. Her accent changed constantly throughout the film and some fight sequences seemed forced.With proper direction from Ayer,Margot Robbie would have been outstanding.My final favorite was Jared Leto's Joker. Although it seemed like he was put into the plot just to have him in the movie, the little that was shown of the Joker was definitely impressive. I was team Ledger, I was not looking forward to the new 'gangster joker,' but overall I was quite impressed for the screen time he was given.Perhaps it was slight weakness' in his performance which caused for so many of Leto's scenes to be cut, but from what I had been shown it was clear that he had put an immense effort into his portrayal. I can't say he was better than Heath Ledger, his character still lacks something which maybe could have been resurrected if he was given the chance, but Leto did a great job in showing his insanity and,in my screening at least, he genuinely made the audience uncomfortable by his actions. It wasn't overdone and it wasn't like anything which had been done before, Leto's intimidating persona was intriguing and sinister.It's a shame that Leto's interpretation clashed with Ayer's. This is the Joker which should have been shown in all his brief appearances, but shout out to David Ayer for forcing Joker,and Harley, to be half of that attached high school couple who couldn't be apart. Jared's commitment and work for being a tortured maniac was pushed to the side for some HarleyxJoker cuteness which wasn't that necessary. The rest of the cast really had no relevance to the story line. The plot was poorly executed and had some stupid mistakes when portraying the villain. I wondered why they even bothered which such a large team as they had no impact on the story or the audience. The only other characters who had some interest to me were Jai Courtney, who provided a comical quality to distract from the plot holes, and Ike Barinholtz, who seemed to derive a stronger performance from those he worked with. Overalll, it wasn't terrible. The cast has such promise but was let down by Ayer's careless editing and use of inappropriate song placement. It's as if Ayer decided lets let the music speak instead of the dialogue (which was fine at times but after awhile we all wished that they would cut off the music). If they had slowed down the film progression, given the characters some depth and actually shown what was in the trailers, then this movie would have been the film of the year. Let's all just hope the extended cut is released and does the cast justice for their efforts. I also hope that Jared Leto and Margot Robbie are picked up for a spin off movie that does justice to their comic book characters and own abilities.",Suicide Squad
2166,os-96186,Amazing Start But It Falls Apart,5,4 August 2016,I'm one of the biggest DC fans out there and if there is anyone who wanted this movie to be great that person would be me. Unfortunately Suicide Squad doesn't really succeed the way me and many others had hoped. To put Suicide Squads problems in a nut shell the movie had a massive lack of story structure but this didn't occur until around 30 minutes into the movie I felt the introductions to the characters were very jumbled some characters had their backstory told at the start some in the middle some even near the end.This movie had all the building blocks of success but the middle and the end don't cut it. It is basically a few scenes jumbled and bled together to make on big fight scene. I'm really sad that DC still hasn't turned around their spell of average releases. We need an amazing movie again DC soon your making us DC fans look bad. Someone get Christopher Nolan on the phone!,Suicide Squad
2167,smileyz-21276,"An uneven but memorable ""superhero"" movie",7,3 August 2016,"For the most part, i'm a big pessimist when it comes to movies, but i went in to Suicide Squad with high hopes and to be honest, I wasn't all too disappointed. The film opens with a colorful presentation of all the main characters, both the good guys and the bad. From Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn to Killer Croc, all were given a brief but satisfying introduction. Speaking of Margot Robbie, she was one of the characters I was a bit worried about. I thought she would be portrayed as a ""goofy"" and ""not like other girls"" type, but Margot Robbie nailed it, Harley Quinn is a completely insane and psychopathic girl with a glimpse of sanity and sympathy which makes her very likable. Also likable is this incarnation of Deadshot. Will Smith plays, by far, the most sympathetic character. One scene in particular shows this when he is forced to shoot down Harley Quinn when she's trying to escape but accidentally ""misses"". There were times, though, when he seemed to feel a bit too sorry for himself, but that's only a minor problem. By far the main attraction is, of course, The Joker. The number one reason for many people to see this movie and I can with certainty confirm that he delivers. And does so with style. Out of all the different Jokers through the decades, this is the only one I can actually say scared me. Jared Leto portrays him as a absolute lunatic with no sympathy for human lives. Cesar Romero's Joker was nothing but a prankster, Jack Nicholson's was a mere gangster with a few jokes here and there and Heath Ledger's was, as with Leto's, a psychopath. But Ledger's incarnation had a plan and ideas. The Joker in Suicide Squad is just completely mad. Mad and eerie. When he was crashing along with the helicopter to his supposed ""death"" I got worried. Of course I knew he was coming back, it's the Joker after all, but at the same time i didn't know if he was coming back, after all, Slipknot died only moments after being introduced. The fact that I cared so much about a psychopath is a great sign of character development done right. The rest of the character were also well written, but uneven. Captain Boomerang just didn't really fit in. El Diablo didn't have nearly enough screen-time and Killer Croc, well, he wasn't really too memorable. Katana was pretty cool, though. The ""good"" guys; somehow they are more unlikable than the main cast of bad guys. This was probably David Ayers plan, but not with Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman. I'll admit, I liked him more near the end but for the majority of the film he came of as a whiny sphincter whose only interest was to save his lover. Now, to end this ego-trip of a review, I just want to point out my main complaint: Suicide Squad is ridiculously uneven. As stated before, the intro is great, but from there it's only downhill. As if from nowhere a main villain appears, Enchantress and her brother who want's to enslave humanity and then, suddenly, the main characters have to save a mysterious person. All of this just seem to happen in the blink of an eye. Then, when this has happened, the movie gets lost and doesn't know what to do with itself, so, again, out of nowhere the ""suicide squad"" has to save the world, which they eventually do and to me that just seems unrealistic for these characters. Harley Quinn herself points it out: What did the world ever do to us?"" Why would a cast of villains suddenly get a change of heart and save the world AND feel good about it?So to conclude: An uneven mess of a ""superhero"" movie, but driven by (mostly) likable characters. I recommend it despite its flaws because it really has its moments, like the Batman cameos and every Joker moment, and an amazing soundtrack.",Suicide Squad
2168,Sadffleck,Most over-hyped and disappointing film of 2016,4,3 August 2016,"So the critics were right all along about Suicide Squad. In fact, the 40+ rating on metacritic is a little bit generous. Batman vs Superman is better and that movie was mediocre at best. The first half of the film was really messy due to the weird pace and despite the character flashbacks, the characters never connected with me. The only ones that stood out are Amanda Waller and Harley Quinn. I can't say much about the Joker because he only had a cameo role (about 6-8mins. Of screen time), Jared's cackle is creepy though. As for the real villains of the movie, I would say that they were very underwhelming. Their introduction was very haphazardly done and I couldn't care less about what they are capable of.For the jokes, most of them felt forced. Only some of the jokes made me smile a bit and this aspect of the movie isn't even the worst part, the final act of the movie is. The climax is really cringeworthy and can be compared to the martha scene in BvS (in terms of cringe level).So overall, the film was really a big disappointment for me considering how obsessed I was with the marketing stage of this movie. It was all hype in the end and I feel bad for DCEU. Maybe Wonder Woman is DC's final hope or perhaps another Batman trilogy set in Arkham. This is really a bad streak for DC and it would be tough to recover from this. It would still rake in money but the future is dim.I'm not a professional critic but I would still give it a score for those who are obsessed with numbers. 4/10 at best.",Suicide Squad
2169,promaticjay,"Happy, gritty fun.",8,4 August 2016,"Every now and then there is a movie with a great cast line up and fun creative out of the box idea. This is that movie. The choreography of this film is great, while they spent their budget well on special VFX the acting is not all that cliché, it's different. The film doesn't waste one second of enjoyable footage with stunning action an amazing soundtrack it shows how dc is really not failing to disappoint it's fans. This movie is good even for people who don't follow comics or watch the other films this movie still amazes random viewers. It's creative aspect follows throughout with good crummy jokes and a threatened appearance. everyone has a good role in the film. Jared Leto kicks it well as the joker showing off his impressive laugh and dark skill set. Margot Robbie plays the mysterious, crazy Harley Quinn who will make anyone want to fall to their knees begging for more. No matter what this is not a film to miss.",Suicide Squad

I don't know who is the enemy at the first place since the witch was part of the team that created to fight who??DC need more creative to made this movie more fun too watch. this is suicide squad that contain bunch of villains.. i am expecting bad*ss character instead of ""criminal repentance""related to the cast.. i thought it's too much for harley quinn, i dunno exactly for what? will smith is good IF the category of this film is drama.. sorry.. overall.. it's quite disappointment movie especially for me",Suicide Squad
2171,miarrigo,Disappointing and messy :(,3,4 August 2016,"I was really looking forward to this movie and only ended up with a huge deception. The script is messy and there are way too many characters that are too quickly introduced. Many of these ""villains"" would require a whole movie to give intensity to their character... I really feel like DC just wanted to have as big an audience as possible without spending a penny on the script. Some good things are the special effects , the movie is overall very beautiful to watch. Some characters need a bravo for their wonderful roles: Harley Quinn mostly... The others are kind of empty to me. And some are very very bad like enchantress who mumbles in a foreign language all along and whose only 3 lines in English SUCK (when she asks Flag to destroy enchantress instead of saving her blabla). The Joker doesn't have a place in the movie, his role does not add anything to it and half of his lines are... awkward moans. El Diablo's behavior is predictable from the very beginning, Batman really wasn't necessary, Katana's few lines are desperately cheesy, etc... As a conclusion, the viewer is unable to feel a link whatsoever to any of the characters since their stories are disappointingly and quickly told. The acting of many characters does not help, whether they were just bad or the director asked them to play in that un-subtle fashion. The script is disjoint, flashbacks don't add much quality or intensity to the movie, and the ""big plot"" revealed at the end is... not much of a secret since the viewer KNOWS enchantress escaped from the hands of Waller. I feel like this is a big commercial move from DC to attract people... However, this will only disgust the people who were fans of the heroes/villains in the beginning. Money over quality",Suicide Squad
2172,lucastnjl,Below par film,6,4 August 2016,"The trailer for the movie definitely portrayed it as an action packed movie. But after watching the movie, I can safely say they really tried to make it live up to the hype. The CGI is really good, but that barely makes up for the flow of the story line. The build up is really slow. The action is spread throughout. I really thought they could have a much better ending. The cast was well-balanced. Leto really played the Joker well considering the amount of screen time he had. He isn't on par with Heath but it was still a terrific performance. Margot's performance was definitely something. She really portrayed Harley Quinn well. Which was definitely surprising. Will on the other was just average. His character Deadshot was definitely an interesting character nevertheless. The lines the characters say are really dull and predictable. There were a few funny one liners but other than that, nothing much really. The critics are really harsh on this film and I can't blame them. I really expected so much more of this film. I hope the sequel will bring much more. Until then Marvel's Avengers are way ahead of DC.",Suicide Squad
2173,stephansid,Very good movie but could've been better,7,4 August 2016,"The movie is not great. It is good, but there are things wrong with it. All of the characters shown in the movie are very colorful and played very well by the actors. Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie stands out the most out of them all. Her backstory is very well done. She also has some very funny moments.Will Smith also does a good job as Deadshot, his family drama is shown too, which was a good addition to his character.Viola Davis as Amanda Waller was good, her character was pretty evil and menacing. Jay Courtney has a few funny moments and also provides a decent job. El Diablo wasn't amazing, but he's still okay. Croc, in my opinion, had some funny lines and was actually transferred pretty well from the comics to the big screen. Katana did not have much to say, but was still a good character. I thought the cameos by Batman and flash were very good and it was a good idea to put them in the movie. Jared Leto did a great job as the joker. This is a completely new joker. I like his new look, his tattoos, his suit and the new style (purple lambo, the gangster look, the parties, champagne, guns, etc). It is kind of a mix between the joker from batman the animated series and Brian Azzarelo's 'Joker' graphic novel, I cannot say if he was better or worse than Ledger and Nicholson because I have not seen him enough. But more to that later. The film was also shot beautifully, the effects were very well done and the action scenes were good. The soundtrack is great too.However there are some negative things about it. The story was actually quite bad, it did not make much sense. The villain was very weak and not threatening at all. Enchantress, her evil brother and the whole witch stuff that went on didn't really fit in the tone of the movie (criminals, assassins, gangsters, batman etc). Another problem was the incredibly limited screen time of Joker. So much promotion of Jared Leto's joker for just about 20 minutes of him in the movie. He is barely there and his presence in the movie often seems forced. I am really hoping to see more of this Joker as I loved version. Again, can't say if he was better than his predecessors, but will certainly be able to if he gets more screen time in future films. Overall, good movie with very colorful characters and great performances, but with a bad story and weak villain. I highly recommend this movie to comic book fans, and it would also be an entertaining experience for normal audience.",Suicide Squad
2174,pmtnarendra,A little bit (much) disappointed,6,4 August 2016,"I came to the theater with high expectations! i've watched all the trailer and got so hyped about this movie, but then it falls apart... here's what i thought about the movie - Will Smith's acting skill is amazing, of course He's a seasoned actor, so when i knew that He's taking part for this movie i'm so psyched! but what i saw from this movie, Will Smith is just being a Will Smith, i was hoping that he's going to act differently.Margot Robbie is great! she's a star in this movie! - Jared Leto is good but not as great as Heath Ledger Joker... and with all the hype or whatsoever, i think his appearance is too short and he's got nothing to do with the main plot... just a marketing strategy i guess? - Cara, not so good actress neither as a dancer 5/10 - Captain Boomerang, katana, killer croc, el diablo, slipknot are just complimentary for this movie, no important roles, no plot, no anything especially katana, there's a scene where she's suddenly out from nowhere talking to her sword, sobbing and then what? nothing.Overall the main story for this movie could've been better, but somehow it messed up and destroy this movie's only twist element. It would be better if the movie keep the audience confuse with what's happened and who's responsible for all the mess before deadshot found the top secret document from the helicopter, but no, they put the scene where enchantress going AWOL from the start so no surprise there, just bunch of action till the end.i give this 5 and extra 1 because i'm a huge fan of batman.",Suicide Squad

There isn't even a Marvel movie that's a ten. DC crams too many characters into their movies. Harley, Deadshot, Rick Flag, Enchantress, and Amanda Waller were the only ones who actually did something in the movie. Harley, Deadshot, and Waller were the only ""good"" characters. The rest of the Squad was just there to be there. Joker was shoehorned in. Flag's romance with June Moone was pointless. Slipknot did so little I almost forgot he was in the movie.

I was very excited to see it and I'm not gonna lie, I was not disappointed. One of the biggest movie's strengths are characters. I loved every Suicide Squad member - their presentations were really good and enjoyable to watch in my opinion.I know this may be controversial but Jared Leto as a Joker delivered A+ performance and the chemistry between him and Margot was amazing. Too bad we didn't see him for a long time.Enchantress(Cara Delevingne) - I'm in love with Cara and I'm really proud with how she performed. Maybe character development was pretty meh but Enchantress had her bad ass moments for sure and Cara was perfect as an Enchantress.OVERALL 10/10 characters, good action, basic but interesting plot line with some humor.

2177,mihaelstipanovic,"Fun and Flashy, Not Quite Enough...",5,19 August 2016,"The only reason my rating is 5/10, is me being a DC Universe fan and Assault on Arkham appreciator. I'm pretty sure that I would rate this movie higher if I was new to the comics.First of all, the idea of creating the Squad was a bit off.It's hardly believable that a group of ""The worst of the worst"" Arkham inmates could ever defeat ""insuperable entity."" I found it amusing but sometimes ""less is more"" really. They could easily stick to the more human, non-alien and not so mass destruction issues and make the movie even more entertaining. Mass destruction attracts superheroes!Above mentioned ""The worst of the worst"" in my eyes are bunch of psychopaths with no remorse and no social skills. Instead, we got a bunch of affliction seeking, strange and loving family of criminals that care for each other. I find it a bit silly.Now, I realize that Robbie and Smith are made to be the coolest, but I also think it was a bit cringe worthy...Will Smith's Deadshot blurting out unnecessary one liners throughout the whole movie was simply too much. Furthermore, Will Smith's Floyd Lawton was ridiculous. Sporting that weird outfit that strongly reminds of that 90-s music videos Smith did, back when M in the MTV stood for music. Also, original Deadshot is white.Harley Quinn would never hide her tears if something happened to Joker. She might be crazy, but she is obsessed with Joker. Also, that rooftop scene when Harley is bulletproof?Joker risking his life and/or freedom to rescue Harley? NOPE.Enchantress was pretty dumb and weak for a magic wielding witch. Hurt by the wooden bat? Eh.The whole plot was a bit shaky but entertaining. I just couldn't find the right wavelength to the most of the characters (also, I'm a bit butt-hurt because Killer Frost is not in the movie.) In my opinion, SS members should have been more distant to each other and fulfill the true meaning of ""antihero"" or ""villain."" Instead, they all behaved like teenagers who want to be accepted by the rest of the group. A lack of sacrificial lambs in this movie is really weird since they put in an effort to make so many unimportant characters.Captain Boomerang, Killer Croc, Katana, El Diablo could all die and I wouldn't care less.I liked Amanda Waller, she really was cruel, mean and I enjoyed in her character portrayal more than I should. I really didn't mind her not being more intelligent.All in all, the movie itself is overly hyped, fun to watch, comic book based Hollywood creation everyone will forget about in a month or two. There were some awesome CGI scenes I always appreciate. The music was really unobtrusive, yet it made an impact on the atmosphere. Sound effects were really neat- a big plus if you are watching it in cinema.But despite being fun and flashy, there's almost no more to it. Leto's Joker was one dimensional and he didn't do anything to make his role distinct from all the other Jokers. I actually have a feeling that this movie is a pile of various and fresh, but extremely unconnected ideas. I think the idea binding ingredient was to take animated movies like Assault on Arkham more seriously.",Suicide Squad
2178,amoury-17951,The critics got it all wrong..,9,4 August 2016,"For me, the movie was brilliant and had great banter. The way how it used Harly and Deadshot and built its plot around it was absolutely amazing, and this is coming from a Marvel fanboy. And Jared's performance as The Joker, wow. It no Heath Ledger, but it's amazing. Heck, even Jai Courtney was good. There were some flaws in the plot, but character development and build up were on point. Diablo was an amazing character, shame he had to end up gone, The Flash and Batmans cameos (well Batman not so of a cameo) were amazing and told us more about the story (Flashes cameo was class). And I see that critics gave bad reviews, but hey there critics and that's their job. If you loved Guardians of The Galaxy, you would love this.",Suicide Squad
2179,rvroriginal,Amazing!!!,10,4 August 2016,"So this is an amazing movie!!I don't know why the critics says otherwise. Probably they got paid by marvel because this is really amazing. I have been watching movies all my life and very few of them worth the time to see them twice and pay for the ticket. I will probably go again and watch it because of the characters, everyone is great especially joker and we didn't see much of him, amazing actors, funny, not at all boring like the first hour of batman v superman (which to be honest i really really like it despised the fact that it was boring at the beginning and the Martha thing ) and also great introduction to the characters. I will expect more if there's going to be an extended cut coming out on bluray but only time will tell. Also amazing mid credits scene, gives the road to justice league. Just wait 2 min after the end of the movie. Just Amazing!!!",Suicide Squad
2180,elforbo,"Jared Leto no Joker, just a joke.",3,4 August 2016,"I realize the Joker was not a main character here but that is no excuse for a weak performance. He was awkward and pathetic. He definitely dropped the ball. As for the plot of the movie i did not care for it. They are too ambitious with movie plots these days and it's just too unrealistic and inconsistent. The main protagonists were extremely powerful but restrained that power against the Suicide Squad hence their downfall. I hate when movies do that! It's not realistic!I do applaud the performances of some actors though. I think Will Smith did a good job, Margot Robbie did a great Harley Quinn, and Viola Davis was a great Amanda Waller. For being very bad guys they came off very hokey and too nice. Especially in the end. Disappointing.",Suicide Squad
2181,vincent_eltgeroth,"Great characters, not so great story",7,5 August 2016,"So I got back from from the screening of ""suicide squad"" and I have a couple of things to say about it. For me it was a fun Summer blockbuster movie, with many flaws, but also a lot of good sides to it. First of I want to point out that it's not really the movie that deserves this score, but the actors and their portrayals of the characters. ACTORS: First of all, like everyone says, there is no better actress than Margot Robbie to play the role of Harley Quinn. She's funny, sexy and of course crazy. William smith really plays his role very well. Deadshot being as badass as he is and with a nice background story to fill his persona. The guy playing Diablo is also very cool and he plays his role very well. Then you have Jared leto as ""The Joker"". I guess I can't really judge his role, because I haven't really seen him a lot in the movie. Leto's portrayal is so much different from what we're used to, that I'm still getting used to him. But it was very intriguing, so hopefully we'll see him in a next movie if he decides to play the role again (seeing the bad reviews and all..). Than lastly I want to talk about Captain Boomerang portrayed by Jay Courtney. I really liked this role. He was so funny and I really don't understand the fuzz about him playing the role. Every time he was doing something stupid, everyone laughed in the cinema. He added real charisma to the character, which I really liked.For me, the rest of the cast really didn't matter to me, because I didn't like their character or the actors playing them.STORY:I really enjoyed the first hour of the movie. Actually most scenes in the beginning and the prison I thought were really good, but the last half hour is what made this movie going from a score from perhaps 9 to 7. WB PLEASE UNDERSTAND: we don't f*cking care about CGI in a movie. yes sometimes it's fun, but movies nowadays waste their money on these graphics, instead of gathering a couple of people who know these characters to make a great movie. Sometimes I really wonder. Does WB ask fans what they think about the script before going into production or they just give these production chances to directors who think they are fans ??? KILLER CROC ?? what happened to that guy. Why is he wearing a f*cking jacket. He is supposed to be big, mean and above all a CANNIBAL. Give him a good story=> boy gets disease, One day he takes a bath, mom finds out, she tries to scrub hiss quills away, until he bleeds, he gets bullied in school and then eats a hand from a classmate and so his dark persona begins. The killer croc in the movie wasn't the one I expected. But then again when I saw him on the poster I already knew that this wasn't really Killer CrocCAMEO'S: There are some cameo's in this movie. Critics are saying that they don't matter. So every time Stan lee comes into a Marvel movie, it means something, gimme a break !!! I liked the cameo's, so more of that please.Main conclusion:Write a story about these characters, get deeper into their emotions. The main villain shouldn't be a CGI villain or some big aura in the sky. Make it a well known DC villain with machiavellistic persona (like the joker, penguin,...) STORY STORY STORY. ASK FANS what they think about the story, listen to their advice and then start production. I really hate CGI, because despite the ""cool"" effects it brings, it's so fake. If I want CGI I 'll just play a game. CGI is the cancer that is killing movies nowadays. BTW loved the soundtrack and it really doesn't remind me of Guardians of the Galaxy. Not everything should be linked to Marvel (also a fan).",Suicide Squad
2182,hmurtaza,one of the best comic book movies,10,14 August 2016,"would like to start by saying that there was nothing wrong in this movie, i found everything to be perfect. the joker scenes were not less, if they added more joker scenes the movie would have become all about joker. about the acting, everyone was spot on, amazing acting. story line was average but it doesn't matter that much because the movie itself was so entertaining. best acting by dead shot and Harley. the only thing i didn't like was dead shot not wearing his mask. oh and whoever goes to see the movie, wait for the after credit scene, crazy scenes :D best villain movie for me",Suicide Squad
2183,maxgrobbelaar,Great movie! Exactly what I expected from a Suicide Squad movie.,10,5 August 2016,"I was extremely excited to see this movie, maybe even more so than Batman v Superman. And it does not disappoint! It is quite dark and definitely not for a youngster but it is definitely what we want from a DC movie. It veers away from the norm but what do you expect from a Suicide Squad movie? Very different to the Marvel movies which tends to be a bit lighter. Suicide Squad has dark colors, dark characters and dark humour, which is what I feel DC is about, darkness. The story is a lot more linear than BvS but still achieves the suspense you want in a comic book movie. Margot Robbie is a perfect fit for Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is a different joker compared to Heath Ledgers but still amazing. I hope to see more of this joker and definitely want to see more of Harley Quinn! I feel Amanda Waller was portrayed very well, merciless and dangerous. The special effects were amazing and the fight scenes very well designed. The music is perfect for such a wacky and dark movie. The little Easter eggs in the movie were great and didn't feel as forced as BvS. The DC universe is really starting to come together and I am short of breathe from excitement!",Suicide Squad
2184,jordanjee,It could've been better...,4,5 August 2016,"I watched it opening night with some friends and they all seemed to love it (although if you ask me they were a little biased). I found myself a little speechless at the end of the movie but not in a good way. Watching the trailer, I expected a straightforward plot where they assemble a team while giving some back story and then they go fight something and there would be cool fight scenes with great chemistry between the characters. What I saw however, was a little messy. The beginning was pretty decent with the backstory I was looking for but it later got very messy and off. The plot developed too fast in some areas and too slow in others and I felt an imbalance throughout the whole movie. Also I think Deadshot and Harley Quinn got way too much attention and kinda stole the show. But as far as comic book movies go... It wasn't terrible, it was a ""fun"" movie and I was entertained nevertheless. I honestly have to say though, the post credit scene was the most exciting part of the movie.",Suicide Squad
2185,kcott-02479,"Half-baked plot, two dimensional characters, and terrible dialogue",6,7 August 2016,"Mediocre at best, ""Suicide Squad"" is confirmation that DC is flailing in comparison to Marvel. Just like Batman v Superman, you are left feeling unsure of/unconvinced by the main characters' motivations, and equally unsure what the heck the writers were thinking when they concocted the plot line. A few observations in no particular order of importance.... 1) BAD dialogue. Just really, really terrible writing there...I don't think a single character said anything funny, interesting, clever, or surprising. Harley Quinn almost got there a few times, but her lines could have been SO much better! For example, WHY would she say ""Are you the devil?"" to Amanda Waller before they even meet? That's not funny and it doesn't even make any sense...it was clearly just the writers trying to show us that the Squad members have a kind of fear/reverence for Waller, but that had not been illustrated yet. It just sounded dumb. However, Margot Robbie delivered her poorly written lines well, and portrayed the character in other ways with her mannerisms, facial expressions, tone of voice, etc. 2) Every scene where it was the audience's time to be blown away by the awesomeness of the Squad member's skills fell very short. For example, they couldn't think of a cooler way to show DeadShot is a great with a gun than using the same freaking cutout people targets that everyone practices with?! How about having him shoot the eye of a pigeon flying by or literally anything else?? Get creative! And then El Diablo's ""wow"" moment is lighting a portion of a building on fire? Any knucklehead with gasoline and a match can do the same thing. None of these moments were interesting to watch. 3) The film's antagonist should not have been supernatural because it didn't allow everyone to shine. We hardly got to see what Boomerang or Katana can do...they could have easily not been in the movie! Why wouldn't they go against the Joker? That would have made him more of a main character, it would have been interesting to see Harley struggle with her loyalty, and everyone could have had cooler action scenes fighting his minions. And didn't Jared Leto prepare super hard for this part? He was in maybe 3 scenes and none of them were memorable. 4) The sudden BFF-ness of the Squad that Diablo references in his ""I'm not losing my second family"" (gag) line, and Harley in her ""you hurt my friends"" line feels really inappropriate and strange...these are criminals who are supposed to be motivated by self-interest and they have known each other for a span of 8 hours. This is not that kind of movie. 5) The ""modern gangster"" theme of the movie really works, and I liked the costumes and appearances of all the characters. Too bad that was about the only thing that worked! Better luck next time DC.",Suicide Squad
2186,msbball,"Good movie, great fun",7,5 August 2016,"Suicide squad...I've been waiting for this movie since I saw the first trailer released six months ago. After seeing it, I can say that I was pleased with it, but not completely. This movie did many things right, but it did some wrong too.One of this movies pros, and cons at some points, is its character portrayal and development. I loved Deadshot and Harley Quinn. Margot Robbie portrayed Harley just like I remember in the cartoons, and she stayed in character throughout the whole film. Will Smith's performance is standard Will Smith, but that's fine, because it was good. I also think Jay Hernandez didn't do too bad as Diablo. Viola Davis was very tough and scary as Amanda Waller, she did very good. However, others, such as katana and killer croc are just put in as filler characters to look cool and be entertaining. Of which they did neither. You may have noticed I didn't previously mention Jared Leto. He deserves his own paragraph. Jared Leto was a very good joker. He was not at Heath ledger status, but I wouldn't expect anyone to be that good. His joker was more excited and talkative. He was unpredictable, and I liked it. The movie did a good job showing his relationship with Harley, such as the helicopter scene and the final scene when he broke her out of prison. I can't wait to see what dc does with Jared Leto, because he has something good going. The main thing that gets me about this movie is the pacing. The first third of the movie was FANTASTIC. When Amanda Waller introduced all the characters and their names and powers came up on screen, that was fantastic. I was a huge fan of the style put in during these scenes, as well as the music incorporated within them. However, once the squad goes on their mission, the movie gets serious with a joke sprinkled in every few minutes. This part of the movie is okay, and just okay. The part that hurts is the obvious change from fun to fists. It left me hoping for more of the first act. However, the action is fantastic.Enchantress was terrible, she was a horrible, ugly villain. Her character wasn't developed enough. When the squad killer her, I didn't care, and when Rick Flags wife came back, I still didn't care. Joker would have been a MUCH better main villain, but her was only in the movie for about 25 minutes, another massive mistake.My comments on this movie may seem mostly negative, and that's true. But that's from a movie standpoint. For a fun standpoint, this movie is it. I was never bored, I laughed during it a lot, and I really did like it. See this movie. Don't expect a perfect film like you would have thought a month ago, but don't expect a terrible one like critics are saying. Suicide squad is an good movie, but it's great fun.",Suicide Squad
2187,elliekay-85619,Suicide Squad Review: The Real Highlights and Flaws,9,5 August 2016,"The movie was really well done! It was brilliantly choreographed and put together. Amanda Waller was one of the highlights, her performance flawless and terrifying all at once. I want to see a lot more of Katana and Boomerang going forward, though I do think that Boomerang's unicorn fetish was unnecessary humour. He'd have stood well as a character perfectly without adding that in, and still maintained the comedic touch in the movie. That said, the movie does keep a comedic touch. And the interaction of Harley and Batman was well done. I know there were people saying that the biggest laugh comes from Batman punching Harley, and I don't know what theater they were sitting in, because that didn't happen where I was. Instead you get a Harley who's clearly dangerous even though she can't swim, and the CPR scene is clearly manipulated by Harley to make Batman uncomfortable. A great deal of the characters is shown through nuances, which unfortunately, critics were so quick to be critical of because, as always, they don't know the source material and thus don't actually understand why the fans would enjoy the movie. On that note, Harley Quinn was perfectly executed and I don't understand the clamoring fight about sexism or inaccurate portrayals. It's like nobody knew her character before going in. Harley's clearly mentally ill, her love for the Joker is difficult, but it's in no way stripping her of her agency, and all of this depicted in the movie. She's not ready to completely walk away from him yet, but the foundations for that are being laid out in this movie, and frankly, it would have been an injustice to her character if she left the Joker within her first appearance. The critics arguing that she loses her cleverness are clearly not watching the same movie, because from where I stand, Harley managed not only to escape, but she makes her own decisions and keeps her agency and games the system, with help, of course, but that's more than anyone else manages. The second half of the movie when the team bonds I think could have been expanded on, and actually, all this movie needed was ten extra minutes of footage, simply of team scenes, to really give it that edge and make you relate to the characters as a team. The movie was very much a character driven experience, and I do think in all honesty, you want to see more of the characters, the Squad in general. However, as a movie setting up the DCCU, it did just that. You got a taste of Miller's Flash, you got a taste of the villains of the DCCU, you got to see the entire reaction to Superman from the lingering aftermath of BVS and it did what it set out to do. It's not the movie that's going to change lives, it's not an Oscar-winner, and it's not trying to reinvent a genre. It's paving a way to a larger continuum of movies to come, and that's perfectly fine. For it's goal, it achieved that. It leaves you wanting more out of these characters. Diablo and Deadshot took the movie as well, which, Deadshot certainly got quite a lot of focus, but Diablo creeps up on you, and his story plays off so well against Deadshot's story, because it's two similar yet opposite results, and you get the humanity of both of them and genuinely enjoy what they have to offer. Either way, this movie was great, it made me genuinely excited for the DC projects coming up, and I can see Margot carrying her own Harley Quinn movie, I can see Deadshot, Katana, Boomerang, Croc returning to the universe that's being established and I hope, going forward, we get more of these characters. The only real cons, In my opinion, were Rick Flagg's entire relationship with June Moon, which, while it gave Amanda Waller's tactical brilliance a point, it's never really developed and falls flat as far as expanding either of their characters. June Moon was never really developed and explored and you just don't quite feel for her struggle. She just, exists. And is mostly forgotten about. As a whole, the villain was was alright. They had the grandiose drama and flair and fit with the ""kill the world"" vibe. It wasn't a memorable villain, by far, and is rather similar to Apocalypse. They exist solely to show you how a team can come together, and to riff off the skills of the actual Squad. The villain could have been anyone else and the movie would have been just fine. The other con is that the team bonding, towards the end, feels rushed. They suddenly become a team, but, again,. I was also disappointed with the hype that surrounded Scott Eastwood's mystery character and the way it just fell flat in the movie, but I'd definitely re-watch Suicide Squad and enjoy it. I think the negative criticism actually helped the movie, on another note, because I don't think it would have lived up to the entire hype it generated to begin with. Leto's Joker doesn't exist on his own, but rather, he's a supporting man in Margot's story. The villain is forgettable. The movie should have instead marketed itself as an introduction to some amazing characters outside of the popular ones. But with the negative criticism, most people will find themselves pleasantly surprised and a bit confused as to what the fuss was.",Suicide Squad
2188,moisedaniel,Bad mouvie,1,8 August 2016,"Pro: The actors were OK.Cons: -The story is not so good, -The characters are poor defined - The hole thing is not linear. -The director just did not knew how to tie all the things together. -The enemy soldiers are so badly created.After Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was flushed down the toilet by film critics everywhere; this massive burden was suddenly shifted onto director David Ayer's (End of Watch, Fury) Suicide Squad. Ayer's dark vision for the DC Comics adaptation was altered into this lighthearted romp filled with ""humorous"" one-liners and a soundtrack filled with nothing but mainstream musical artists. With Wonder Woman and Justice League set for next year, Warner Bros. and DC panicked in an effort to make Suicide Squad a safe bet for a crowd pleasing action film. The end product is yet another disjointed mess from DC that disappoints on nearly every level. Forming together during the aftermath of Superman dying at the hands of Doomsday in Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad has a secret government agency run by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembling a team of criminals and super villains and forcing them to work for the government rather than simply living out the remainder of their sentences in their jail cells. Lead by Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the team consists of Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). Also a part of the team is the unpredictable witch Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) and Flag's soul-stealing and sword wielding bodyguard Katana (Karen Fukuhara).",Suicide Squad
2189,baltayanan,I don't recommend to pay for this movie,1,5 August 2016,"This movie is made for DC Fan without taste. Bad story! No fun, No fear, no emotion, no originality, bad fight scene. I don't really see, any interest for this movie. It is a waste of time, so watch it if you have nothing else to do (but like really nothing else because most of the thing will be better than this movie)! Now with my friend, we have this sentence that we are using when we are doing boring stuff: ""still more fun than Suicid Squad""I was bored after 30minutes, I wanted to leave after 1hour20 ...

Critics' expectations in a movie will be different from comic book readers. Overall, It is a treat to comic book fans. Critics refer a lot for complicated ""Nolan"" Movies and then rate them, why not read a comic and then rate this movie? But, it would be better if a normal audience had a comic book reader aside, just to inform about the depth of the characters, otherwise they may end up confused. Expected a lot from Mr. J but news has that some of his scenes have been cut. It will be a musical experience than a film. Background story could have been a little more clear and other than that this movie is just a treat. Watch and Judge the movies, don't read reviews and judge them.",Suicide Squad
2191,brandonaustria,Good but not a perfect movie,6,5 August 2016,"I saw this movie on its premier, and there is no review so far that really seems to have the 100% same opinion as me so I'm making my own review. Every suicide squad member is likable in this film. That is something David Ayer did perfectly. But lets start with the issues of this movie. For a movie to be really really good you need an antagonist to be just as good as the hero (heros) and this movie completely failed the villain, I'm gonna say who the villain is because i came into the movie and knew who the villain was gonna be and i thought i ruined some of the movie by knowing it before i saw the movie. The villain of this movie is Enchantress. They did give us one reason to understand why this character did what she did and why we even should like her personality. So the 3th act of this film is really really bad, because of the villain and the effects. The effects was not great at all, it was almost like watching a game.The 1st and 2st act of this movie, was excellent if you ask me. The action was good the characters back story was great, the humor was good and it seemed like every member had a motivation to join this suicide squad even tho they didn't say it out loud (which is something good) Because i at least like to see things for my self instead of a character in the movie telling it to me. And when it comes to the Joker which is a character you guys are excited to see, at least i was. For me it seems like Jared Leto is the perfect actor for this role. You have no idea what this guy is gonna do next and i like that, it builds excitement. I also think he looks great as the joker. Im not going to mention every character, but a lot of reviews are saying Deadshoot and Harley quin ¨steals¨ the movie, i don't agree to that. Yes those two are given the most backstory, but i still liked every other character as well. They made Captain f**** boomerang seem like a cool guy that says something. But i have to say this thing tho, when Deadshoot jumps up on the car and starting shooting people (as you see in the trailer) this is the moment when you understand how good this Deadshoot guy is on what he is doing, you get so pulled into this scene. So anyway the 1st and 2st is great, really good actors and characters, the 3st act is really bad, you don't feel anything for the villain and you barley understand why she does what she does, as well as the cgi is bad. I will give this movie a 7/10 if this movie didn't have such a bad ending i would prob given it a 8,5/10. There is one thing I'm sort of mad about, and that is that David Ayer only had 6weeks on writing the script for this movie, i think they should have given him more time and not rushed the project so much. Sorry for all the words written wrong, i'm not from America or England so this is not my main language. Anyway let me hear your thoughts.﻿",Suicide Squad
2192,natichin,Best movie of this year so far!,10,5 August 2016,"For me, this was just what I wanted and expected. I was smiling like an idiot through all the movie. It's just so much fun. I really don't know why some people are giving this movie such a bad review... I don't know what they were expecting. This is NOT a super hero movie, is about villains, it HAS to be messy, they are messy. They don't work like normal super heroes, they don't go, do the work and save the day like others. And It's good that they make character introduction that long... many people don't know ANYTHING about these villains, maybe they didn't even know they existed. It's good that they present us their story so we can somehow ""connect"" with them, so they no longer are seen like just ""villains doing bad things ha ha"", but people who made all the wrong choices but can have a second chance after all. Also, I don't know why they are comparing Heath Ledger's Joker with Jared's. Don't get me wrong... Heath Ledger's Joker was perfect, but why compare the work of two EXCELLENT actors? Jared Leto's Joker was brilliant. For me, he is a different Joker, one we haven't seen so far. I can't compare them, because they are so different and I don't understand how some people would think it's fair to do it. Jared made an excellent Joker, a Joker he was ASKED to do. Excellent work. I saw it yesterday and I wanna see it again, by myself with a remote control so I can pause and rewind any time I want. I'm very pleased with this movie, I loved it.",Suicide Squad

2195,chuds-67865,Not perfect but enjoyable and exciting,8,7 August 2016,"This film is nowhere near as bad as critics tell you, so don't listen to all of them. 'Suicide Squad' has its flaws and a lot of them refer to the marketing of the film. The editing of the character profiling was trailer like, and almost defeats the relevance of the character trailers the film distributed weeks before, showing almost like for like content barring a scene or two. It should be assumed by the film's beginning, that the audience are mainly comic book readers or at the very least fans of the superhero film genre. This oversight meant, in my opinion, 15-20 minutes of wasted storytelling. The sound editing in the early act of the film also made me fear for the rest of it. When soundtrack changes every two minutes, it almost feels as if the music is being shoehorned in and you don't get to appreciate the tone of the scene as much as you would when it is used correctly. After hearing about five different songs in the very beginning and by the end seeing that two of the more popular songs ('Heathens' by Twenty One Pilots and 'Sucker For Pain' by Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa and Imagine Dragons) were used primarily as credit music really disappointed me. Now to the good, Deadshot was fantastically portrayed and I felt like he could carry a Batman film as a main antagonist, as scenes in the film would further suggest. Contrary to critical reviews, I felt that Deadshot as well as most of the other squad members show villain traits and I would like to think that prison has allowed some of them time to reflect on their crimes and some of them to show remorse or lack of it. Deadshot showed a conflict of interests in his story arc, evident from his arrest in the beginning to his moment of shooting the explosives which detonate Enchantress in the finale. Jared Leto's Joker depiction caught my eye with how different and refreshing it seemed compared to what we've been treated to film wise over the last thirty years. His Joker was reminiscent of Tony Montana, Cuban drug lord from the 80's classic, 'Scarface' twisted with Jack Nicholson's Joker in 1989's 'Batman' and Heath Ledger's own rendition from 'The Dark Knight'. Leto's style was very unique and I think we as an audience can collectively say that we got something from a film featuring the Joker that we haven't seen in the past; The Joker being in love. Main villain Enchantress was a strong choice and an interesting spin on the story, I liked how they had to conflict with someone who is ultimately similar to themselves, and led by the love interest of Enchantress' alter ego June Moone in Rick Flag, respectively. The brother character I didn't quite understand, as I felt that it wasn't really explained as to how he got his powers and what his powers actually are. Furthermore, Harley Quinn was also a huge highlight in this film. Critics who complained about her outfit are surely picking at straws and should realize that in a lot of source material, Harley Quinn is dressed seductively and provocatively. Yes, her shorts were edited in the trailers to appear longer but if you think about the audience that this trailer would be broadcast to, you would undertake the same decision to make everyone not have any faults about your marketing material. Side characters I didn't think would do that well actually surprised me in a sense. El Diablo was the real star of 'the rest' of the cast and his incredible powers combined with his conflicting pacifist nature made you want to seek more about his backstory and become horrified when you hear what happened. Killer Croc should have had a stronger story arc in my opinion; I think they definitely had the right idea starting the film with Killer Croc being depicted as an animal and not a person. They should have run with this idea and used him as feeling sorry for himself and perhaps sacrificing himself in an El Diablo way that would've suited his story arc. Captain Boomerang was admittedly acted very well and made me want to see more from him as well as Deadshot, Joker and Harley. That being said, I felt they could've used Boomerang in a more inventive way and explained some of his backstory such as his love for unicorns and why he's so erratic. Amanda Waller was a big surprise in the film and showed just how much she didn't give a damn during the film with the constant execution threats, using Slipknot as an example and even killing her own officers. This all in turn made her a villain for the villains to not fight against but abide by and adhere to. The power she had in this film was incredible and I felt one of the stronger acting performances in the film by Viola Davis. On a side note, Batman's short cameos were epic and a breath of fresh air that was perfect in both character trailers of Deadshot and Harley Quinn. His role in both made me want to see Batman against both villains and would definitely feel cheated if we didn't get to see this in the Batman solo feature due for release in the coming years. Suicide Squad isn't a bad watch by any means. For me I left the cinema feeling quite happy and relieved that not all critiques are correct and I have come to disagree with a lot of critics in the last few years as my film taste has developed and matured. This film has laughs, has dark elements and may lack an exceptional story that 'The Dark Knight' thrived on but is still enjoyable and makes me want to see what else this universe has to offer. Overall: 8/10",Suicide Squad
2196,izzas-64731,Not Good but Not Terrible,5,5 August 2016,"When leaving the cinema, the one thought you don't want to have is that ""it could have been better."" With such a great premise, Suicide Squad could have been incredible. But unfortunately this film, in my opinion, now joins the long list of movies which had great potential but failed to reach it. The major problem for me was the lack of grit and reality which would have given Suicide Squad its edge from every other superhero film. Instead it overdosed on CGI and that manufactured Hollywood glow which meant it wasn't as cool and as raw as it should have been. Another fault was too many characters, which once introduced (which was very necessary) a good half and hour had been lost. I reckon you could have halved the squad and it would have made no difference to the movie. Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn carried this film in my view (she basically the reason for 5 stars!) and I'd totally go to a Harley Quinn only film. Will Smith as Deadshot was also good as was Viola Davis as Amanda Waller and the rest were decent enough. However, Jared Leto as The Joker was a bit of a disappointment. I get why people loved his portrayal but all I could think while watching him was how alike he was to Jim Carrey! And unfortunately Cara Delevigne as Enchantress was pretty laughable! I can imagine it was so much fun to make this film and although not amazing, I can't class it as terrible! Time to try again DC?!",Suicide Squad
2197,brianna_ward,Great Movie!!!,9,5 August 2016,"Haven't been home for more than 10 minutes, but I just had to address the critics. SUICIDE SQUAD Did NOT deserve the 27% Rotten Tomatoes gave it. After reading all the reviews, I was devastated, but it wasn't bad...wasn't perfect either. It's what I expected of DC. THIS Ain't MARVEL FAM. Definitely GO see the movie! FOR THE MOST PART, each characters backstory was coherent, and I loved how HARLEY was fleshed out, shes a wacky girl.Joker was entertaining, Jared Leto is the BEST choice for this movie, and for the direction DC is going for, if this is any indication of it. Although I LOVED it, there was something off with the movie. Can't quite put my finger on what it was, but I gave it a 8.5 to 9/10.My mom said, ""This movie saved DC,"" (and shes tough to please like omg) and my dad gave it a 7.5/10 if that says anything(which was surprising because he was geeked at first to see it. But then again I was reading him reviews before we went to see the movie, and he's impressionable.) ""He(my dad) said he liked it but was expecting more."" Sure they have some work to do, but I feel that this is just a stepping stone for more movies to come.I suppose reading all the issues with re-shooting, an alleged six- week script, and all the rumors circulating right now, if this is considered ""bad"" than I'll take it. Cause it's not as bad as everyone is making it seem, like I truly tried to find a lot to s*** on cause I was on Twitter when the chaos erupted. It wasn't a lot to whine about. At least I wasn't bored like I was when I watched Batman v Superman...",Suicide Squad
2198,sandrorteixeira,"Goo start, bad ending",5,5 August 2016,"Not bad but not really good. The build up of the characters was awesome, really, really good but suddenly it all falls apart... The biggest disappointment was the joker... I mean, Jared Leto did a good job but someone like the joker needs to be in the main event of the movie and the guy appears in the movie for like, 10 minutes, more or less... Harley Quinn and deadshot were really good, killer croc didn't disappoint, diablo was nice too but the villain, the wish were just a big joke. Could be better but it's still worth your money. Let's wait for justice league. I hope to see THE JOKER in the next movie and not just a part time criminal.",Suicide Squad
2199,andrewwshotwell,I Liked the Movie this Could've Been,4,5 August 2016,"This movie could've been so good. It's not, and that makes me a sad panda. The main issue is the scope of the plot. I'm a big DC fan and have read the last few runs of Suicide Squad since its resurrection. It works because they're not trying to save the world. They have a specific purpose: when the US government doesn't have jurisdiction and doesn't want to start a war, they send in the Suicide Squad. If they fail, the government denies involvement and blames it on the misfit B-list villains. The actual terrorist/cult leader/splinter cell they're after in the comics are never particularly interesting, but it doesn't really matter because as soon as the squad is deployed, mayhem and one-liners come so rapid fire that you're having too much fun to realize the actual objective never really mattered in the first place.This movie needed a grounded war-monger/terrorist villain with desires firmly planted in reality. Sure, throw in some hostages that need to be saved and some mildly super- powered disposable henchman for good measure, but whatever you do, don't make the Suicide Squad responsible for saving the whole damn world. The Flash and Batman will worry about that. They're far more equipped for the job than a sharp-shooter, an Aussie with an affinity for boomerangs, and a giant cannibalistic crocodile. Sure, you can write a hack story where each of their individual skills proves to be crucial to taking down the big bad, but it'll come off looking contrived and unearned. Exhibit A: this movie.In my opinion, the Harley/Joker scenes were really the only thing that worked here and they were few and far between. There was a Captain Boomerang moment that made me laugh out loud, and then the movie proceeded to ruin the joke 15 seconds later. As a fanboy, I certainly appreciated Easter eggs and nods to the source material, but I would've far preferred a linear story that gave more space to the characters. It would've been simple:1) Introduce the characters 2) Send them somewhere awful 3) Let mayhem and hilarity ensueThere was no need to freaking Tarantino the Suicide Squad plot line. There was no need for the world to hang in the balance. 4/10 because, despite the script, Robbie and Leto managed to squeeze out a few moments that did justice to my two favorite villains from the DC Universe.",Suicide Squad
2200,CNBrennan,Horrible Writing and Direction,1,5 August 2016,"Wow. What an unbelievable mess of a movie.As someone who is good friends with several of the crew members of this film, I can tell you for a fact that David Ayer did NOT have any clear vision of this project and had no respect for his crew, the actors, WB, the DC characters themselves, or comic books in general. The amount of reviews posted about how his ""brilliant"" ""dark visions"" were destroyed/manipulated by WB studios make me unsure of whether to cringe or burst into laughter.This movie was doomed from the moment they hired him to write and direct. Next time, hire someone who actually LIKES comic books, values the creative work of others, and knows how to treat human beings with respect.",Suicide Squad
2201,jackjafari,Well... I guess you could call it 'Dirty Avengers',6,5 August 2016,"Director: ""Ok Cara, you're trying to destroy humanity and take over the earth.

That's gold! We're going to sweep the awards on this one.""I got my ticket for free and I'm really glad that I did. Intriguing trailers the past few months, but it feels like the movie just wasn't thought out very well. Yes, I know, it's a shoot 'em up flick, but they can at least try to pretend we're not total suckers, right? Will Smith: you don't need to Sandler yourself; you're better than this. Margo: congrats on being hot (The End). Jai Courtney: was than an Austrailian accent? I'm not being sarcastic, I couldn't tell. Jared Leto: I'm mixed here. I felt like his Joker was lacking.. Heath Ledger set the bar for a Joker performance, that could be it... The plot feels like a giant contradiction. The entirety of everything that goes wrong in this movie is Waller's fault; seems like she walks away free and her program is still there (sequel). I think my favorite part of any of this is the ongoing debate of whether Harley Quinn is an appropriate feminist character. Facepalm. Feel free to see this movie if you get a free ticket or want to laugh at Cara dance in her funny costumes/special effects.",Suicide Squad
2202,venomzgaming,An amazing movie just what DC needs!,10,6 August 2016,"I have been waiting for this movie since Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice turned out awful, however, this movie makes up for it is is so much better it is able to fix the timing issue and a steady plot that Batman v Superman failed to do and was able to combine all of these different genres into a comic book movie which is what this is straight from the pages of a Suicide Squad comic book.Of course like all movies it has some bad spots, not all movies are perfect, it has a slow beginning but that just builds up the characters more before the action begins which was amazing, I'm didn't like that the Joker was in it as much as I would have hoped however Jared Leto said that they cut out a lot of his scenes.The imagery mixed with the correct score and don't forget soundtrack made this an amazing film which I thoroughly enjoyed, also some amazing cameos!!Overall I would give a 9.5/10 however you can't do that so it will have to be a 10.",Suicide Squad
2203,nagato-91884,Entertaining Film,9,5 August 2016,"It wasn't a bad movie at all. Had a cameo that wasn't in any of the trailers. Harley took the icing off the cake in my opinion...The plot was coherent enough to get from point A to point B but was meh at the same time. P.S., THE MOVIE REALLY DOVE INTO HARLEY'S MINDSET, which was cool cause Margot played her effortlessly.Jared did better than I thought as Joker. DC has a lot of work to do though but this was definitely a turn around. I'm gonna buy the blu-ray when it comes out for the extra footage!!!! Joker(Jared), and the fire of his loins, Harley, need more screen time, I cant wait to see what the future holds for them cause how the two interact from here on out will be fleshed out on the big screens reaaal soon. NOW, on my way to see it a second time w/ my girlfriend.",Suicide Squad
2204,danieljscuba,Here's the problem,7,5 August 2016,"The movie itself was actually decent on it's own legs. Jai, Smith, Robbie, everyone put in as good a performance as you could expect. No one seemed like they were phoning it in. The visual effects were good. The plot was shaky, chaotic, and disjointed; however they managed to bring it back together before it got lost in itself. A decent 7 in comic movies. The problem is that they are basically starting their DCEU run by making joint movies instead of stand alone movies. The biggest complaint across every recent DC movie is that it loses focus trying to introduce characters and backstory. BvS was 3 iconic stories and 2 introduction stories mushed into one film. Suicide Squad is no different. A big part of what being a DC fan is about is the deep storytelling. We know about The Joker because he's been methodically laid out to us. All of these villains have just as rich a story, but we're getting 1/4 of the potential in a messy montage. It's unfulfilling, upsetting, and it's why DC is losing.On a personal note, I hated the deconstruction of the Joker from smart, crazy philosopher to badly dressed gangster. It felt like they had no idea what to make him say or do. I know he's not supposed to be a big part of this movie, but what they had him do felt maligned to every previous Joker in history. To be clear, I'm blaming the studio, not Jared Leto, and I don't even like him.",Suicide Squad
2205,ethanros,"Despite what many critics have to say, this is a very good movie",9,5 August 2016,"This is a good, fun movie. If you like comic book movies you will enjoy ""Suicide Squad"". I'm not sure why many critics think that this great movie was so ""terrible"". It had great acting from the entire cast, especially Margot Robbie and Will Smith and it had just the right amount of jokes. That being said this movie wasn't perfect either, but no movie is. The story could have been better, but it was still good and worked fine for Suicide Squad. Also, it should have been longer. When you have so many character that haven't been on the big screen before this you need to use as much time as possible to develop their back stories, which wasn't done very well. For the characters with the largest roles like Deadshot or Harley Quinn their are fairly short backstories, while the backstories for characters like Killer Croc are given no screen time. This doesn't take away from the overall film too much, but it is the reason that I couldn't give it a 10/10.",Suicide Squad
2206,julietaornelas,Must watch movie. I've seen thousands of movie and this one was good.,9,5 August 2016,"Okay so everything was awesome in this film. This film is just as good as the batman trilogy. The Harley Quinn character is perfect there's only one time where she doesn't sound good.. Like one line. And the joker is awesome he doesn't come out throughout 100% of the movie but he is in the storyline. From beginning to end. Deadshot is hilarious the film focuses on every character. But a few characters have more sciences than other. Katana, killer croc, and Echantress could have been given more scenes but if you know your comics your good. Amanda Waller is exactly like the book version but a bit worse like in evilness. El diablo and deadshot will make you cry. The villains are like the avengers but with a funny evil side to them. They could be more evil. The movie is as good as any other movie it's not as good as the titanic but it's not as bad as Batman v.s Superman which was only bad because it was confusing. Oh and when Harley and joker dance it makes you want to cry because that scene is perfect. It's exactly like they dance in the comics but better. And Harley's outfit is more explained in the movie because if you read the comics you know that Harley has said that it would be boring to wear the same outfit everyday like superman. And captain boomerang is funny but not as noticed as other characters.",Suicide Squad
2207,mkwsultan,Worst Movie in my Recent Memory,1,5 August 2016,"its my first review on IMDb, but SS (Suicide Squad) compelled me to do so. Its probably the worst movie ever with this high budget and good cast. You may realize in the first ten minutes that its a BORE. Story is a mess, plot is a mess, illogical and stupid ideas and it is extremely annoying if u go all excited/Jolly with high expectations (like me) to watch it. I still cant believe that Will Smith worked in this movie. His presence in the movie was kind of an assurance for me that it was going to be good. The trailers also seemed good because trailers do not show the kind of crap which there is in the movie:). Acting of Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) is probably the only good thing about the movie. Despite all these negative reviews i'd still want people to watch this movie once or at least send one person from friends circle to watch this movie/waste money and then come back with a review like this one so that next time makers of this movie do something better or at least digestible.",Suicide Squad
2208,dp-43902,Depends on what you're watching the movie for...,5,6 August 2016,"David Ayer's Suicide Squad falls short in many different categories and emphatically disappoints on more than one spectrum. The bottom line is, this movie had so much potential that it fails to reach. With such an A and B list cast, I was surprised at the result of so much hype and anticipation. Between some specific lines in the film that were very poorly written and painfully delivered, the plot that is unfortunately so thin you'll wonder what's happening every few minutes, and the character development that is basically non-existent (I'll admit that I'm sure the writers thought it too difficult, time consuming, and maybe even unnecessary to include backgrounds for every single main character, but unfortunately this lack of development leaves the audience drowning in a sea of familiar faces and questioning who these characters are and why they're important to the story) this movie, as disappointing as it may seem, tries so hard to be something it simply is not. Jared Leto's Joker was average in my opinion, but credit to him. Honestly, how is anyone supposed to play that character now after Ledger perfected it eight years ago? Will Smith and Margot Robbie played enjoyable characters, but their performance is far from their best. If you're looking for an action-packed display of bullets, fire, loud noises and close-ups, definitely go see this movie. If you're looking for a thought-provoking, strong, character-driven, antihero storyline that flows elegantly yet recklessly, I would tell you to look somewhere else.",Suicide Squad

Ayer did a fantastic job bringing them to the screen. It ultimately lived up to my expectations. This jaw dropping thriller will have you wanting more and more of it until the very end. All time favorite scenes were the chemistry throughout the squad near the end. The only thing I could take away from this film is at some points the plot was scattered, and some incomplete character arcs but it wasn't as noticeable as critics have said. I recommend you go and see this movie whenever you can because it sets up the future of the DCEU, Another reason to see it is Margot Robbie's excellent portrayal of the 'infamous Harley Quinn'.

2210,chchoo,One of the worst writings I have ever seen,1,6 August 2016,"Honestly, the writing is so bad I don't even know where to start. I think the main problem is the witch, who is not an appropriate villain for a squad that uses guns and bats. Also, if Waller had the witch's heart the whole time, why didn't she destroy the heart and stop the witch from destroying the city? That would have cut the movie time in half and saved me from having to watch another hour of this dreadful movie. There's a whole bunch of characters that don't do anything-- like the Japanese lady, the bank robber, and the crocodile. It would have been best to stick to fewer characters and develop them. This movie is just a mess. I don't understand how this writer got so much money to write absolute crap and the crew went along with it. At one point, you would think someone would be like 'Wait, this doesn't make sense... throwing a dynamite into a whirlpool of magical crap is gonna stop it?'

Still, I decided to go and watch the film for myself and make up my own mind ! The film is well acted and has quite a good story line. The world is rocked by the death of Superman and has woken up up the threat of meta-humans and the danger they pose to humanity. Cue Amanda Waller and her plan to form Task Force X, a.k.a. the Suicide Squad. The introductions of the characters takes a while but at least they are quite well done. Harley and Deadshot are clearly the stars of the film and take centre stage. Having said that, all of the cast do a really good job and deserve praise. The story may be basic and fairly straight forward but it is the journey that the characters take that is of interest. The bonds that the members start to form and the interactions between the characters. This is a good film for DC and if the upcoming films are this good then I will be a happy man !!!If you look superhero films then go watch this and make up your own mind !!!",Suicide Squad
2212,samsonbutcher,Abysmal,2,6 August 2016,"The movie starts off by failing in its attempts to adequately introduce the characters, their backstories, their motivations and their loosely-entangled love interests. From here the plot fails to enjoyably progress as a consequence of dreadful acting, problematic and inorganic dialogue and the introduction of one of the lamest super- villains I've ever had the displeasure of watching on screen. Throughout the film the characters fail to go through any sort of meaningful arc or development, leading to one-dimension and clichéd personalities - the result of which is zero emotional attachment from the viewer to anything that is happening at all. The movie is visually boring, featuring stale cinematography, dull colours and tedious action sequences.Overall it was dire.",Suicide Squad
2213,bjornhendricks-39500,"Don't listen to the critics! The movie was fun, and action packed and awesome!",8,6 August 2016,"CONS: 1) I wanted more from Killer Croc. I wasn't the happiest with the way he spoke or moved. But that's a minimal gripe. 2) I also had a little issue with the ""acting"" of Diablo. He had a great moment in the final fight and that made up for it, but i felt like he was kind of a cheesy actor and wasn't as ""natural"" as others. Ironically, this was only in the end for the final fight. Because the rest of the film, I like how he had the ""sentimental reveal"" and I really connected with him. 3) Finally, i had a moment or two of saying ""really, that's it?"" when it came to the final fight. For example, with Enchantress' brother. I expected much more from him. I also thought Enchantress was way more powerful and shouldn't have had such a hard time with them or been defeated so easily. There was a moment where she said something like ""enough of this....play time is over"" and she waved her hands and disarmed everyone. When that happened, i was like ""you should have done that from the beginning!"" LOL. 4)In the beginning, I felt as if they were jumping in quick and I thought the movie was about to end. Then they expanded further and did some flashbacks and it all made more sense. It also continued past where I thought it was going to end and I was relieved. 5)Too much of the comedic moments were in the trailers. For a movie that didn't show too many trailers, I was surprised that a good portion of the major comedy moments were already spoiledHaving said that, there was waaaaaaaay more good than bad! Things I loved were: PROS: 1)Loved Will's portrayal of Deadshot. He killed it! I look forward to seeing him in another movie. 2)Loved Amanda Waller.i can see her definitely being the lynch-pin between all future DCEU movies (kinda like Fury initially was) while working in the shadows. ESPECIALLY after that mid-credit scene they showed! 3)I loved the chemistry with the whole Squad. They def pulled off having multiple stars in a single movie. 4)The humor was great and so was the music. Sometimes the audience didn't laugh as much as I expected at certain jokes, but it could have easily been a diff reaction if I was in a diff theater with diff ppl. 5)The appearances by Batman and The Flash were perfect. Just enough to wet everyone appetite for Justice League and the upcoming solo films. Once again, it wasn't THEIR film, so they only needed to be seen in terms of quick backstory and how they relate to the Squad as opposed to full character development. 6)Action sequences were well played out. I think Civil War set the bar HIGH and it will be hard to top or meet. But it's the same for Deadpool when it comes to comedy. Suicide Squad had a good mixture of both even if it didn't exceed the other films in their respective areas of focus. OVERALL, It's DEFINITELY worth seeing!",Suicide Squad
2214,evilperson-87949,It Lived Up To The Hype,8,6 August 2016,"Suicide squad, the film that I have been hyping about for over a year with my brother and my dad. Every time a new trailer came out we all sat around a computer and watched it, waiting patiently for the film to come out. And when it did, we all thought it lived up to the hype. let's dive in. Amanda waller (Viola Davis) is a government agent who realizes that with superman gone, the next superman might be evil and thus she forms the task force of some of the most dangerous people in the world to defeat a powerful supernatural being. Now first off, Amanda Waller is scary as all hell, I mean like when I saw the trailers, my thought was; ""how scary can this government agent be in comparison to a team of dangerous criminals"", then after watching the film, my thought was; ""I would rather be in one of jigsaw's deathtraps then be in the same room as that terrifying government agent"". That is how scary she is. Secondly, the joker (Jared leto) is not the villain in this film, I have no problem with that, I just want to point that out. He is more of a supporting character. Third, the characters are really good in this movie. I really feel like the actors were having fun with the role. I felt lots of connection with the characters. They did a good job at casting. Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) were great on screen together. I really have just one big complaint with the film; the pacing. The film starts off really fast paced, then it slows down so much to the point where I felt so bored because of how slow it was to the beginning. And then it speeds back up, then slows down, and it is a big problem, but that is my only real problem. With all of that said, I give this film ⅘ stars.",Suicide Squad

There are 3 simple (!) rules about people like these. And nothing is remembered. A bit spoiler, but it's clear from trailers: wanna test legendary murderer? No problem, free him and ask to show abilities. Oh, he killed everybody, how suddenly! Spoiler: no. Logic... There is no logic in this film. But it's still good enough for 10-12-yo. DC and WB, they can't understand — jokes don't make movie great, they... Hm, don't know. But when they decide to add some funny moments 'cause of failure Batman vs. Superman (c'mon, that scenario...), it seems like the movie was remade completely, 1st version scenes replaced with funny versions, that's why movie looks ripped.

What it was a ""grey dark movie"" became a ""pink sparkling friendly"". I'm so disappointed with Suicide Squad, the movie had a great potential. And to be honest, who wrote the the joker lines and actions? That is not what Joker look like, hes looking like just as another spoiled teenager that just got his toy stolen.

Will Smith as Deadshot; I love Will Smith, but when it comes to Deadshot I feel making him a snarky character with humorous lines takes away part of what I love about him in the comics, his professionalism amongst all the crazy people. ""That's yer problem, lady. You believe people can be cured, be made healthy, be made normal -- that they can be saved. That they should be saved. But maybe the only way to cure some people is with a bullet between the eyes."" -- Deadshot It's thinking like this that makes Deadshot who he is.2. Jared Leto; I had hoped that Jared Leto would do great as joker, but I was sad to discover that his performance left me wishing that he wasn't in it. He acted like a gangster and not like the multi- layered clown that Joker is. Now you can argue that this is because it isn't his movie, but I felt they took the clown part away and left us with a normal crime boss.3. Joker and Harley relationship; Now to make it clear I don't condone the type of relationship I'm about to make a case for. The relationship between them in the movie is one of crazy ""love"" where they both genuinely care for each other, but in the comics and most other versions it is a very toxic and abusive relationship where Harley eventually gets away from him and is better for it. The Lovey thing in the movie doesn't feel right for the characters.4. Slow motion; My final thought is about the use of slow motion especially in the final scene, Where Croc throws a bomb and Deadshot shoots it; this little scene takes about 5 minutes because its all in slow motion my companion and I both were dumbfounded when this happened because it was out of place and really annoying.Now because some might look at this and go ""He keeps saying whats bad and nothing good."" Well I thoroughly enjoyed Margaret Robbie as Harley, El Diablo was actually pretty good, same for Amanda Waller, and boomerang was acceptable also. The main reason I didn't mention this all at the beginning is that aside from Waller and Harley none of these characters were really fleshed out enough to mention in any depth. In conclusion, I don't think it was a horrible movie, but as a huge comic fan it disappointed me that it was as bad as it was.",Suicide Squad
2218,sarikastratwilismki,Great movie,7,6 August 2016,"This movie was the anticipated movie for everyone including me, I'm not really dc or marvel fan so its not me to judge or compare between them. For me this movie is great, their actor and actress really hit the mark, including jared leto and i still don't know why people really annoyed by him, for me he is fine and no if you think he is gonna be clown like he is not, he make his own joker, selfish but in love joker, its different yes, but not bad at all. And everyone is just as good as he is. But i don't know how this movie seems kind lil bit shallow, its lack something maybe the plot or the direction? But its connected and not in the same time.. weird right.. but its definitely something you have to watch",Suicide Squad
2219,tarahmconroy,Great Movie,10,6 August 2016,"I just saw Suicide Squad in 3-D last night and was initially skeptical with all the mixed reviews I have been reading this past week.First thing: Please stop comparing these DC Extended Universe movies to the Christopher Nolan Batman Trilogy. Thats like comparing Bob Kane's batman to Frank Miller's version. Both are night and day different but great in their own aspects. That is what is going on with these movies. You have to watch these movies and not compare them to the movies from the past. Have a open mind and enjoy the fresh take on these characters because as far as comic book movies go Suicide Squad is an EXCELLENT movie. Its filled with cameos and story builders for future movies while still telling an individual story that is entertaining.Second: I do not see why critics are calling this movie a mess. As a person who went to art school and studied films as a visual effects and motion graphics artist i saw beautiful, artistic imagery and was able to follow the story line just fine. Never once did i feel lost, confused, or felt like there was any scenes that were unnecessary is developing the story or individual characters personality. This movie follows the perfect formula for story telling and future story building.In conclusion these movies grasp the darker aspect of the DC Universe, which the comics of the eighties are known for, while providing a modern feeling to the characters. Suicide Squad is definitely worth seeing in theaters, especially in 3-D. If you have even the slightest interest in seeing this movie, please go see it. Have an open mind as if seeing these characters for the first time and i guarantee you will not be disappointed.",Suicide Squad
2220,jashfordrowe,"This was another quintessential DC installment, trending to the strange, devoid of plot but with some interesting moments",5,6 August 2016,"I would almost recommend the ticket price for Suicide Squad just to see Harley Quinn alone..almost. But while Robbie's quirky and sexually charged take on the iconic character is worthy of your time, much of the rest of the film leaves you feeling largely unfulfilled.The plot is thin on the ground (when it exists at all) and for a large part the characters are more caricatures than characters. The first half of the movie involves an overburdening of backstory and the rest follows through a string of turbo charged action, which, whilst exciting, doesn't really have any sort of direction, as we are left to wonder exactly how these villains were ever let loose on this mission in the first place. Perhaps the government had misplaced Batman's phone number? There are some positives, Will Smith is excellent as the dry witted Deadshot and Jai Courtney's character had a number of enjoyable punchlines, for which we can almost forgive his hammed up Aussie accent. But the same can't be said for Jared Leto's joker. It was overacted, unnecessarily weird and devoid of purpose in this film. And then there's the stock standard and wooden villain from another dimension, Enchantress, who is really only there to give the squad something to shoot at to end the film. This was another quintessential DC installment, trending to the strange, devoid of plot but with some interesting moments.",Suicide Squad
2221,boog-31958,"More fun than GoftheG, no raccoon, better; Margot Robbie",9,6 August 2016,"This movie was at least as much fun as Guardians of the Galaxy. I gave GOG a 6, gave this a 9. Instead of an irritating raccoon we get a delicious Margot Robbie plus the Joker. It never ceases to amaze me how every Marvel movie gets rave reviews and all DC movies have ""bad script"" etc etc. The soundtrack was great. From the Rolling Stones to Credence Clearwater Revival. Songs from my radio listening days. Most of the leads did a very good job, especially Robbie. She really stood out. Great supporting cast. And this is always what makes a good movie. It felt like a comic book, not some convoluted mishmash from the bent mind of Stan Lee. And thank God, no cameo from that incorrigible HAM. Really Stan. Go some where and sell tacos or such. Stan, see Alfred Hitchcock. He knew how to make a cameo, and did it with class.For a summer fun movie I'm guessing this is going to be the no. 1 fun movie of this season. It was so good I may go see it again. Something I haven't done since movies became available on DVD. I got most all the jokes. Maybe it takes more intellect than most critics have-or they're just all Marvel fans and WON'T ever say any thing good about my boyhood heroes.Go see it. If you don't get the jokes; read more real literature then go see it again. It should make a real difference. Boog",Suicide Squad
2222,shuyaiba,It's better than your average super hero movie,8,6 August 2016,"Before reading further I want to layout my movie c.v Movies which I find excellent in this genre1. The dark Knight trilogy2. The avengers Movies which I find alright, with high potential going further1. Man of steel2. Iron Man 1 Movies which I frankly do not like1. Batman v superman2. Hulk 2008Now to review this movie. Characters1. Very well introduced, we know where they come from, what they are capable of, and why they are there.2. Dead shot and Harley Quinn are the leads and they not disappoint even for a moment.3. Joker is just pure awesomeness, people say he had very less time, I think he was in it for just the right amount of time. This joker is more crazy than the Dark Knight joker. 4. Amanda is the boss, Flag does what he is supposed to do, nothing too delightful, because his character was just a middleman between Amanda and dead shot frankly. 5. Supporting squad members all are entertaining especially Diablo & Boomerang. Katana and Croc were just there and wouldn't have made much difference if they were not. 6. Cameos, Flash and the Batman make appearances, but they were negligible. 7. Motives were clearly laid out for the villain. Action1. All of the actions were clean and easy to follow, not forgetting entertainingStory1. Story was easy to follow. Everything had a reason to occur, and whatever was unclear, were negligible. Emotions1. Some parts were however this isn't meant to be a serious movie, its more like a fun movie with a serious take on magic. Characters who are serious or fun are what they are because of who they are. Flaws : a bit of spoilers1. During the climatic scene at the end, questions were raised as to why the flash didn't turn up. 2. Part of the villain history is not clear which is a very integral part of the evil side in this movie. Summary This is the guardians of the galaxy of the DC universe. If we look at the movie from that perspective i.e its mostly meant to introduce characters and entertain you, you will be more than impressed as it delivers more towards realism and a grounded approach than it's competitor. The hate that it's receiving, 26% on rotten tomatoes at this time, is hilarious. I would question my movie review critiqs or websites on their neutrality.",Suicide Squad
2223,julianposadam,This is an AMAZING movie,10,7 August 2016,"I only suscribe me to this page because this movie deserves a better review, the critics don't say the truth, this movies is for fans that understand the multiverse DC and are lectors of comics. I recommend this movie is amazing and the soundtrack too. It's a different movie because it shows a glimpse of his life and as part of the team, it's amazing effects, mood swings or anger are well cared for at the moment is showing the most humane people as it has done lately DC unlike marvel (are films seeking basic and empty joke), here no DC is more serious and darker (something great) just because they dare to do something different and tell and write that is boring and bad NO, because those critics do not understand what many fans understand and is a universe that is well under way, for my part would like a second part. Thanks Warner, actors and David Ayer for this great project. Excuse my regular writing. : D",Suicide Squad
2224,nuklearcomix,Just bad....,2,6 August 2016,"Lets do this, as Will Smith's character Deadshot said; So I saw Suicide Squad tonight and as I predicted a long time ago, it was bad and it was actually worse than I thought it was going to be. I'm going to focus on each character individually to focus the rant. DEADSHOT, played by Will Smith, was the murderer for hire / father of the year / hero / villain with the heart of gold, but really he was just plain old Will Smith so he ends up being the main guy in the movie which is pretty lame because that's not what Deadshot would ever be. Killer Croc is now a, very stereotypical, black criminal, that smacks of Michael Bay's 2 urban Transformers that spoke in a ridiculous Ebonics dialect. In addition, to his thick ""inner city speak"", Croc growls like a Lion a little too often but the really weird thing about Killer Croc is that he seems to actually shrink over the course of the movie, having been massive during most of the flick and by the end, Croc seems oddly small?? Captain Boomerang's superpower is complete uselessness. Amanda Waller, played by the great Viola Davis is simply a weaker version of the completely ""unshakeable"" Waller that I know from comics and cartoons. Katana, a character I really wanted to like more, partially because that's my daughter's name, but no, I did not name her after the DC character. Katana's character bio was right out of the comics but we didn't get enough of anything else to make her any more than forgettable. El Diablo is the fire guy / children and wife murdering Latin gang member / reformed bad guy / the villain that doesn't want to use his powers because it's not his fight guy / the guy that could end every fight in 2 seconds but only uses it during the final fight character, so basically, fire/cliché' guy? Harley Quinn, played by Margot Robbie, who looks like her character without much effort, so that's a big plus! Robbie's portrayal is fun but I expected her to be THE comic relief of this film and she was, but most, if not all the humor was chuckle worthy at best. I loved the casting of Robbie from the start but they Warner Bros. never seems to deliver with the characters that matter the most. The Enchantress is a character that I know absolutely nothing about but that really doesn't matter because she was solely used as the focal point of a terrible story. After the ""god- like"" Enchantress mows down dozens or hundreds of soldiers and takes over a section of the city she capture Amanda Waller and asks Waller, ""How she can destroy the army"" or something like that? Nonsensical on ANY level, just like most everything else. I thought Jared Leto was a good call for the Joker but sadly, the Joker doesn't appear in this movie. However there is a white faced, green haired, tattooed idiot that is nearly incomprehensible in every scene? Rick Flag, who cares.... Now that the characters are out of the way, I'm going to reveal the dreaded ""Martha"" moment in this stupid movie: Rick Flag is the military company man who leads this group of bad guys for Waller so he's the guy they all hate. So near the end of the movie when they're all about to throw in the towel, Flag pulls out a bunch of letters from Deadshot's daughter and says, ""she writes you every day"" and BOOM, turning point, now they're buddies and Deadshot says, ""lets do this"" or ""lets go save the world"", doesn't matter because it's just bad. I could go on and on about every terrible detail but why bother when I can simply say that it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it really does make BvS: Dong of Justice seem good, because at least Wonder Woman was awesome and we got a pretty solid cinematic Batman for the first time ever. Suicide Squad is poorly written and cringe worthy throughout the entire movie and from where I sit the future still looks bleak for the Warner Bros/DC universe. The answer is simple, be true to your characters and it almost always works out for everyone.",Suicide Squad
2225,ljjallman,"I liked it, but...",5,7 August 2016,"It was fun, no doubt, but what the film did well was cancelled out by it's flaws. Some of these flaws are minute details that many would be willing to overlook, but to others it's impossible. The one that annoyed me most was the relationship between Harley and the Joker. She's meant to love him and this was shown in the film, but she's meant to LOVE him! She's obsessed whilst on the other hand, The Joker has little regard for poor Harley. Their relationship in the film was too even between the pair, the Joker wouldn't bother breaking her out of prison but Harley would have taken up Enchantress' offer to bring him back in a heartbeat. Other flaws include the pacing of the film, the introduction of each character was great, their profiles on screen were very stylish offering insight into each villain, but you could tell which characters were going to be at the forefront of the film through these. Captain Boomerang and Katana's introductions were lazy and didn't offer much to the film with both ending up as missed opportunities. There were other flaws but I'd be nitpicking if I were to debate over them, onto the good parts! Humour was incorporated well with some jokes falling flat and others being needless. Croc made me think of a Groot/Thing hybrid. He shouldn't be funny, he should be ruthless and cold. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, both superb. Will Smith's Deadshot isn't the Deadshot known from the when the Squad was formed but is a great character non the less. The other characters needed more depth and screen time to be appreciated and I hope justice is served if they appear in future films. I personally don't care much for Leto's Joker but that may be down to the fact he only appeared for 15 minutes tops, of maybe it's because he's just not Heath Ledger. The laugh seems out of place too. Considering all the hype surrounding the film pre-release I was left disappointed, but I had fun. For all the stick Deadpool got for it's lack of faith to source material, Deadpool's character was spot on if a little too heavy on the sex jokes, this deserves just as much if not more. Too often SS deviated from it's source material regarding character traits, I'm not too bothered if the story isn't ripped straight from the comic (it's more fun if it's something you haven't seen before) that certain characters were not who they were meant to be or had no purpose in the film other than to be extra targets for the bad guys so the big players had little trouble in combat. Oh yeah, the bad guys were pretty lame. Enchantress was cool, quite scary to be honest! But she's gone now so hey-ho. She deserved more. But the grunts were generic, faceless grunts that posed no threat to the 'heroes'. All in all, it was good but it really should have been better!",Suicide Squad
2226,johannamariaodakivi,Oh well,8,8 August 2016,"Suicide Squad was dark, gritty, fun, and had wonderful action. The depth of certain characters was presented properly.While they could have shown the Joker more I feel that they did a great job blending the grit and darkness that belongs in this new DCEU.Harley Quinn was perfect. Will Smith was better than I thought he would be.Amanda Waller was on point.If you are a typical fan of the fun-loving Marvel universe then this might not be for you but if you're looking for a grown-up version of a Superhero movie then I highly recommend Suicide Squad.They are doing these DC movies properly and I have a feeling that these ""critics"" are conspiring with Disney to bring these movies down when the fans love them.I absolutely LOVE the movie. I am not sure what the critics problem was but I thought it was awesome.The only complaint I have is that... I WANT MORE!I absolutely loved Harley Quinn and The Joker. Deadshot was amazing too.I think it was a fun movie and could have been even better in the Rated R version but I was extremely happy by the end of it.",Suicide Squad
2227,dorianwolfpack,Great movie and characters,9,7 August 2016,"Great movie !! Characters have a full background story leaving you with emotions attached to them and seeing everyone in the squad weak points. Only reason it's not getting a 10 is because of in the fight scene at parts you can't tell what's going on so if they slowed those down the movie would get a ten for me. Will Smith does a great job playing Deadshot. Deadshot and Harley Quinn ends up being my favorite out of the squad at the end of the movie. Croc had the least amount lines and when he did talk it was corny but he was still a good character do to his fighting scenes. Critics really underrated this movie, I guess cause everyone came in with too high of expectations for it. Will be seeing Suicidé Squad 2 if it comes out. I recommend you watch it for yourself.",Suicide Squad
2228,trishnt-39729,Anticipation was not in vain,10,7 August 2016,"This is my very first review of a movie on any site, so that should tell you something. The main reason why I am doing this is in the hopes that someone who sees bad reviews from so many other people will still give this movie a try because they will not be sorry.This movie was great from start to finish. The high points as far as characters: Jared Leto (Joker), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn), Will Smith (Deadshot), and Viola Davis (Amanda Waller). I have been a huge fan of Jared Leto for many years, both as an actor and musician; however, when I first heard that he was going to play the Joker, I had my misgivings. These were put to rest during his first appearance. He played the part to perfection. I have seen many reviews discussing the three main Joker performances (Leto, Ledger, Nicholson) and comparing them. I will not do that. I loved all three portrayals and feel that they each brought their own style to the role with fantastic results. I do not feel that this diminishes the accuracy of the character via comics as we have seen it with every Marvel and DC film so far. I'm not going into a huge amount of detail here but have any of the Supermans or Batmans actors portrayed their characters exactly the same? My only complaint regarding The Joker was that he was not there enough. I have heard that the Blu-Ray will have some more scenes and am also hoping that the rumors of him being teased to lead into more of the plot in a later film (like Thanos in The Avengers franchise) is true. More Joker!!!!!!Margot Robbie was also incredible. I have seen reviews stating that she is simply there for one liners. Not true! Does she give them? Sure, but that's Harley Quinn. Her role in the film is integral. Couldn't have asked for a better performance.Will Smith ... let me start by saying that he is not one of my favorite actors at all. That being said, wow, did he deliver in this movie! I definitely liked how he walked the line between villain and family man without skipping a beat. And last but not least, Viola Davis. I am so glad that she took this role because I don't think any other actress would have the presence, ability, or facial expressions that made her role of Amanda Waller really come alive. She is a bad ass that I would definitely not want to mess with. In many ways, she sometimes came across as more menacing then the bad guys, and that's saying a lot.The other characters/actors were also incredible, not one complaint.This is the first movie that as soon as I was walking out of it, I really wanted to get back in line, get another ticket, and see it all over again!",Suicide Squad
2229,mougharabin,Loved it!,9,7 August 2016,"Great action, character introductions (in case you've been under a rock for fifty years or so), and if you can't follow the plot then you weren't paying attention, watch it again! Smith, as always, owned his role as Deadshot, and I dare say Leto made a certain impact of his own. I know that Suicide Squad is getting ripped apart by the critics, but I dare say any of these 'professional' critics must not know jack about the one, the only, Harley Quinn! She is for all purposes the reason I went to see it, and Margot delivers - in my opinion she stole the show, but then I've been a Quinn since she was introduced in the animated series, so I'm biased. Best advice, ignore the reviews (including this one) and just go see it!",Suicide Squad
2230,evanod-22404,Amazing! Must See!,10,7 August 2016,"This movie is amazing! The cast is fantastic! If you're a DC Comics fan, you'll love this film. It's perfect. Right out of the comics. Leto is very good as the joker but there just isn't enough of him in the film to give a negative feedback. I think he was solid. Harley Quinn and Deadshot were fantastic! It was their movie all the way. Professional critics just don't understand the film or the comics so they give a negative review. I am a hard core comic book fan. This movie was everything I wanted and more. It was hilarious. Batman was in it just enough to be completely awesome. The flash cameo was really cool. All the characters were well developed. I would definitely go see it again!",Suicide Squad
2231,adamcmtc,Nicely done new twist on old characters!,8,7 August 2016,I was pleasantly surprised with the movie overall despite poor reviews. Nice short backstory on characters that mattered and well acted for the most part. Critics try to over analyze action sci-fi flicks instead of just enjoying a well done film and letting the people judge themselves. You are not watching Gone with the Wind or The Shawshank Redemption. It's a movie based on comic book characters made for adolescent adults to enjoy! Just be happy someone put this together and only hope for a sequel! If I never saw the story between Harley and The Joker continue it would be a real shame! Also the Will Smith performance was not as bad as reported! This isn't a role for Tom Hanks or he would have been cast!,Suicide Squad

I took to the Internet so that others don't get betrayed like me. Really boring, cringing and disappointing movie I have watched in quite a while. The only amazing part about the movie is its trailer, and that's it! All, the characters are kinda forced to group up against some illogical $h!t storm that was ""accidentally"" created. The plotting was really poor, even a 7 or 8 grader could come up with something more appealing. Hope, others don't make the mistake I did. The only thing that took me throughout the movie was the hope of some real action as the movie suggested. People thought Batman vs Superman was bad, well, this one will sure make you thankful for the BvS.",Suicide Squad
2233,SilverKnight566,Great movie with a fun cast and plot,8,7 August 2016,"Suicide Squad opens up a lot of potential for future comic book movies. If you're a fan of the comic team then watch this movie and ignore the critics. I am all over the Joker man. That chase scene in the beginning made me so happy. Their origins completely showed the abuse of Harley by Joker during her origin and it also showed Joker's very sentimental side for Harley. Also, people may be more upset by how Joker is more of a pimp now but their characters are just like something off of one of the Arkham games, I'll use that as reference. Especially with Joker being a gangbanger because as we know, Penguin, Joker, and Black Mask own the biggest gangs in Gotham. He was clearly psychopathic and clearly different than other versions. Their love for one another felt exactly like something we should have seen. Deadshot was very well written. I'm going to keep it short though. The one thing I liked about his character is how his character and his daughter took a lot of inspiration from the comics. I'd say Will Smith brought the character more to life than the CW version. Speaking of bringing characters to life, let's talk about Captain Boomerang. Like this Digger Harkness has to be one of the best criminals I've seen to date, he tried to take every option to get out of the action as he could. He played the petty criminal who was all in it for the money and didn't give a damn about the plot. He was all in it for himself which is a very Captain Boomerang thing to do given he's apart of the rogues. PLUS WE GOT THE FLASH IN THAT ONE SCENE. THE EFFING FLASH. I'm sorry Grant Gustin, I love you but that was a monumental moment. Something I'll never forget is how well these movies are connected. Diablo's origin was so well written. They gave a lot of exposition for his character. The fight between him and Incubus had to be the best action sequence yet. It was so unexpected too. Slipknot had to be the most stupid character. He served only as a filler to give emphasis on the whole bomb implant, in other words...we knew he was going to die. Now, here's what I liked about the movie. I liked how the plot was something that no other big comic book movie has ever tackled before. Like in every Marvel movie you see, it always has to do with the main protagonist for example Thor and Loki in Avengers, Ultron and Stark, Captain America and Bucky, or Ant-Man and Yellowjacket. And it's always the same plot, ""Oh, I'm going to wipe out humanity, destroy the world, cause wars, etc."" It was never about ruling the world but it takes it to another extreme. It references largely on the Nightshade Odyssey, probably the most famous Suicide Squad comic. This movie wasn't afraid to even feature the Alex Ross scene. This movie wasn't afraid to go realllly deep in comic lore. I mean really deep. I am going to make one comparison is that it's a lot like Guardians of the Galaxy because all of these characters who aren't connected in anyway come together. Except in Guardians, you probably didn't know who most of them were. In this, you knew most of the characters. It was all about interpretation. I said it before but I really like how connected these movies are so far, even in the after credits scene you had Bruce Wayne which supports a lot of my original expectations. This movie wasn't a clone copy of Assault on Arkham and had the most unique plot line and casting of any movie I have scene. I feel like this is a huge evolution for movies that critics just don't see. Another thing I really liked was how the movie never gave any of the plot away in the trailers. They cut most of the scenes from the trailers out as well. Most people thought Enchantress was on the Squad's side but surprise, surprise it was completely different. That's what I loved about this movie is if it went one way, it'd go another. Like, we thought Diablo was going to get his ass kicked by the demon or whatever but he actually kicked ass with a new ability. Now, it's time for improvements. I personally think the movie had A LOT of pacing errors. I'm not trying to sound like I didn't like how it flowed, it flowed really nice for the most part. But the pacing is what got me. The backgrounds, the origins, they were very meaningful, very detailed, and made me like their characters but felt out of place with the current scenario. The directing was great but I felt like it could have done better. I speak that for all movies though. I feel like any amount of directing for any movie could always be better. But Ayers for the most part did great. What I originally thought was that Joker was going to be a completely different plot. He was however. Except he was a side plot who gave weight into some of the main plot. His main improvements could have been giving him more screen time even though he got enough. I thought in my own opinion after watching the movie was that Joker and Harley should escape and then the Taskforce is sent out again to imprison both of them which gives way to a new plot where we might get an Assault on Arkham plot which would really show the ""spy"" side of Taskforce X. It makes sense, especially with a lot of Joker scenes cut from the trailers. Though I think I'll leave it right there.. This movie gives a lot of potential for future comic book movies and I enjoyed this more than other films this year. You should definitely check it out.",Suicide Squad
2234,snegi-25619,Haters Gonna Hate !!!,9,7 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a superhero movie based on the DC Comics antihero team written and directed by David Ayer. According to Director David Ayer ""Bad vs Evil"" is the theme of the movie. It's a dark and gritty movie followed by lot of humor.The plot of the movie is quite simple but there is lot of humor in the movie . The time line of the story is after the death of superman Death in Batman v Superman . In the comics The Suicide Squad, officially designated as Task Force X, a secret team of super villains who have been imprisoned by the United States government. The movie's source material is same as comic book . Just like the comic books, Viola Davis as Amanda Waller assembles a team of dangerous criminals and antiheroes in the movie and places them under the command of colonel Rick Flag played by Joel Kinnaman . The antihero hero consists of Harley Quinn aka Joker's girlfriend played by Margot Robbie , hit-man Deadshot played by Will Smith who never misses a shot , El Diablo played by Jay Hernandez, Captain Boomerang played by Jai Courtney, cannibal Killer Croc played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Slipknot played by Malcolm McDowell . And later they are joined by Katana as a Flag's bodyguard at the time of departure for a mission . Amanda Waller also recruits Flag's girlfriend , Dr. June Moon played by Cara Delevigne . Dr. Moon is an archaeologist who is possessed by a witch-goddess known as ""Enchantress"" . Besides that Suicide squad has our beloved ""Joker"" in it . He appears later in the movie and in few flash back scenes . Speaking of 'flash' backs there are cameos of two members of justice league too . There are flash backs of every character's origins and past life too like Harley Quinn's origin which is brilliantly introduced on screen There are lot of jaw dropping , little bit of nail biting moments in the movie too like the Deadshot's audition , high wire act by Harley Quinn , lot of Joker's moments , El Diablo's final act . The first two act of the movie are quite entertaining but the final act didn't impress me much . One of the reason is villain was little lame and story was simple . In the first act i really liked the way Amanda Waller gathers the team members . The pace of the movie little fast but it was tolerable . Although I feel like few characters in the movie were pointless . They were just there because of source material and DC fans . I personally enjoyed the movie . I really respect the bold creative choices that Director David Ayer made for the movie . But it really disappointed me that they cut so much stuff from the movie . They showed us lot of other scenes in the trailers but it wasn't in the movie particularly the Joker's scene . Joker was in the movie for only 10 minutes which was little sad for MR. J's fan like me. I have heard that movie went under re-shoots too and there is an alternate version of movie with an alternate ending .I think Director David Ayer had some pretty good ideas but the execution wasn't that good . the story maybe quite simple but I feel like it's worth watching .The movie is worth your cost for ticket with some popcorn. I think it's a good start for DCEU (DC Extended Universe ) knowing the fact that there are studios like Marvel in competition .",Suicide Squad
2235,uvacezz,Better than critics say,7,12 August 2016,"Suicide Squad the highly anticipated movie of 2016 is out and not a lot of people are happy about it. Before I say what I liked, let me get what I didn't like out of the way. The main problem with this movie is the plot. The plot is awful and I am upset that they couldn't come up with anything better. My second problem was editing/cuts. The editing was very very weird at times and I could tell they cut out a lot of important scenes from the movie. My last problem with this movie was the VILLAIN, they really could't come up with any and I mean ANY other villain then who they picked in this movie. Now lets talk about some things I liked. One thing I liked was Margot Robbie. She was incredible. Well that's all I have for now I will finish this review later",Suicide Squad
2236,justinbyw,This is exactly what the DCEU needs right now.,10,13 September 2016,"This movie is awesome! This film is directed by David Ayer and stars Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Cara Delevingne, and Joel Kinnaman. The acting in this movie is absolutely phenomenal. The visual effects are also amazing. Even if you hate the film you have to admit the soundtrack is awesome. This film is also really funny. David Ayer did an excellent job and as you already know Margot Robbie and Will Smith stole the show with their amazing portrayals of these already great characters! Here's something I thought i wouldn't say Jai Courtney was actually good in this. The story telling and overall plot is extremely good! The movie has flash back scenes explaining who these characters are and they are some of my favorite in the movie. Let me talk Jared Leto for a minute. We probably saw more of the Joker in the trailers and promotional material than the actual movie. That being said in the little time we saw him he is still amazing! When you leave the cinema you are going to be left with wanting more of the Joker (BTW the Joker is my favorite character in anything ever). Now this movie isn't without its faults, no movie is. The passing and editing can be off at times and the villeins plan is a little generic. There are also lots and lots of scenes that were cut especially scenes with the Joker. I think this is mostly do to Warner Bros. seeing the intense back lash Batman v Superman got for being to dark and taking its self to seriously. Which in turn forced Mr. Ayer to do lost of re-writes and re-shoots to make it more of a light heart ed film. To recap this film has amazing acting, special effects, action, sound track, and story. Some of the passing and editing could have been better but over all this is a awesome film and definitely worth going to watch and is exactly what the DCEU needs right now. Remember this is just my opinion so go check it out for your self. Thanks for reading and just keep on laughing!",Suicide Squad
2237,gilby-35611,Bad. Just BAD.(SPOILERS),3,7 August 2016,"This movie was extremely disappointing. Overall, the pacing, plot, and characters were mostly just horrible. 1) Leto's Joker was obnoxious as hell and served no purpose apart from backstory for Harley. 2) Slipknot, Captain Boomerang, and Katana had zero reason to be there and added zero to the movie. 3) Enchantress was a HORRIBLE choice for villain. I'm supposed to believe that two beings that are damn near demi-gods are going to be beat by two guys with guns, a gal with a bat, two folks with knives, a strongman, and an unwilling to fight walking inferno that doesn't want to fight? Diablo was the ONLY one remotely near their power level and even he showed that he was beaten by just one of them. 4) Related to #3, why the hell would Enchantress, who can pretty much wreck anything on the planet with her machine/spell, not just fry them like chickens as soon as they said no, they wouldn't join? 5) For that matter, why the hell would she decide ""Oh, let me give them a chance and just fight with some blades."" 6) If Enchantress could teleport, as they showed her teleport across the world and back in a second, why couldn't she teleport and grab the case/her heart from Waller once Waller had opened it to stab at her? Or just take it while she slept? Even with a motion detector, she grabs it, teleports, motion detector shouldn't set off. 7) If Incubus pretty much took out everything the military threw at him, why would a simple bomb (one that barely blew up about a 10 foot radius) take him down, even if weakened from Diablo? 8) After seeing her brother fall, why would Enchantress even bother not to just off the Squad if she is so angered by humans? The only metahuman among them had just died, so why bother? She doesn't need them apart from just making her army even stronger.",Suicide Squad
2238,rishbhar,Suicide Squad was a jumbled mess. (Spoilers),4,7 August 2016,The movie Suicide Squad felt very long and dragged out. There were too many parts trying to move and it made a 2 hour movie feel like a 3 hour one. In my opinion they could have easily thrown out the villain intros and made them short flashbacks of what happened. Katana (Karen Fukuhara) felt forced in and had a confusing background. Elaborating on her story could have improved the character. Also the whole Joker (Jared Leto) sideline was unnecessary and strange. Perhaps they could have changed that by alluding to him throughout the movie. Perhaps having Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) talking to a shadow building the Joker up to a Batman movie. Diablo (Jay Hernandez) had a complex character background and actually felt like a person who felt guilty for what he did. Killing him off felt unnecessary and strange. After he was defeating the Brother why did he not stay in that form and run away from the blast. All around the death felt like the director just wanted a death in the movie.In conclusion the movie Suicide Squad felt like it had a lot of missed opportunities whether with characters or with the plot itself. The movie felt like a bunch of mumbo jumbo and was all over the place.,Suicide Squad
2239,warboss-25317,Suicide Squad is thoroughly enjoyable,10,7 August 2016,"There are aspects of the film that do let it down, I'll admit. The plot isn't very strong, Killer Croc was lame and some of the lines were corny. Other than that, it was spot on. Dark, funny, action- packed, there isn't a lot more you could want from a Comic-book movie. They did a really good job portraying outlandish comic book villains like Captain Boomerang, someone who by all accounts should have been super lame, and making him into a very likable character. Jared Leto was excellent for the limited screen time he had, closer to Jack's Joker than Heaths. All in all, definitely not as bad as critics have made it sound. Worth a watch for sure.",Suicide Squad
2240,jillianpriess,It was so boring,2,7 August 2016,"I never once got excited. The whole time I'm just watching, waiting for something interesting. When Diablo, the fire guy, is getting worked up by Will Smith I thought it would get interesting finally. Nope. Just super anticlimactic. Even when he dies I was bored. The Marine guy was so mean I really wish he did die. He was so awful. Also, they never felt like a team. Just a bunch of people who happen to be in the same place. Harley Quin was good and Will Smith was good as well. They were the only people who grew a connection. Hardly but something. All the other characters were wasted as background noise and decorations. The movie was hardly funny. Over all the theater laugh like 5 times. I'm summary, it was boring, the Marin in awful, they weren't a team, and characters were wasted.",Suicide Squad
2241,ugly-39333,Fun movie...best of what is out right now.,8,8 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a fun movie. Honestly, the characters are way more interesting than superheroes. I'm not sure why the critics are hating on it so much. It is a little messy, and there is one sequence with the witch that is a little goofy. Compared to what is out right now, it's better than Jason Bourne and Ghostbusters. Comparing it to other superhero movies it's far better than Iron Man 3, the first Thor, both Hulk movies and the first Captain America. And isn't anyone getting tired of the same story line in both Avengers movies and Captain America Civil war. I wonder how Tony Stark will undermine the team in the 3rd Avengers movie. The only better superhero movie I've seen this year was Deadpool.",Suicide Squad
2242,plato-53648,Enjoyable but not much if u can't stand somewhat choppy plot.,7,8 August 2016,"The movie being superhero film centers around anti-heroes who are being manipulated to save the world.The ensemble cast featuring will smith,Jaret Leto, Margot Robbie has been able to garner much of attention in past two years, since it's launch has been announced. First 30 minutes of the movie focuses on introducing main anti-heroes going over all there unnatural powers just like the vibes one get while watching a typical south Indian movie. obviously it would be enjoyable for many as it induces the ""ahan"" feeling. From that moment plot starts turning a bit too fake or choppy with some audience complaining it to be a random compilation of pseudo random shots. The aerial plot of movie centres around the blunder of enchantress ( one of the initial ant-hero) gone wrong (right,given he was an anti-hero) and suicide squad standing against her in the temptation of reduced prison sentences and some perks. The movie was enjoyable due to it's spontaneous psycho humor,well timed soundtracks,and undeniably the presence of Harley Quin and her sultry psychotic demeanor.Jared Leto as Joker is devilishly charming but extremely psychotic .Kids would definitely enjoy it and teens would love it. So is it a chilling prospect? -- let's stick to enjoyable. Is it a badass?-- yup. Which comrades to accompany for this one? -- rebels, demagogue,easy going ones. Worth my 2 hours? --- yup if u don't have a girl to hangout with :)Still DC comics have a long way to go in seething it's comic books but suicide squad seems a promising start.",Suicide Squad
2243,peteraxe-45514,"Not bad movie, though failed by the aggressive PR",7,8 August 2016,"I've finally watched the most expected movie of the summer and maybe even of the year. What can I say now? I have really mixed feelings and now I'll try to summarize them. The whole situation about this film in the world is clear. People are disappointed and so am I, but this movie is actually not bad. I'm sure this movie was killed by its aggressive PR company. For 6 months we were fed with trailers, teasers, official pics, songs etc. By the end of this company the expectation was unbearable and we were sure we're gonna watch the best movie of all times. And after all we get the NOT BAD movie. That's unforgivable. Let's start with the actors and theirs on-screen incarnations. Whole movie can be split in two parts. The first is the actual presentation of heroes and the second is the action. And that's where the movie begins to fail. There are a lot of characters and that's also a problem as the development of each is rather unbalanced. Actually only two of all deserve our attention. Of course that's Harley Quinn and Deadshot. I don't have any grudge against Margot Robbie, she is awesome and the best part of the whole movie. I can say that's the best realization of Harley in the movies. Waiting for her solo movie. Deadshot turned out to be the most interesting and well-developed of all. He has his past, his relationships and the motivation, cause the others suffer the lack of it. What about the rest of heroes... Boomerang seemed interesting, but he stayed absolutely undeveloped, Killer Croc looked interesting, but that's all. Slipknot...what the **** was that, are you serious?? Kara Delevingne is beautiful herself, but her Enchantress is one big disappointment. Viola Davis created the violent and smart manipulator and Rick Flagg wasn't really interesting. And yeah, we have The Joker. Jared Leto is cool and his presentation is really good, but I have the questions about the way Joker was made here. The gangster, the mafia... I don't know, The Joker has too little on-screen time and looks completely unnecessary. The plot is the weakest link of the movie, the main antagonist is simply nothing. I think better not to have antagonist at all than have the one we got here. The scenario isn't just simple, it's not developed and is full of plot holes. One of the huge advantages of the movie is its soundtrack. All tracks are really god-like and their mix leaves only pleasurable impressions. To sum it all up, this movie is not bad, but it isn't what we expected all the time. A lot of problems, weak scenario, lotta strange and stupid moments, inability to understand what is this film - drama or comedy... Of course you'll watch this movie anyway and there is a great chance of improving in the sequel. So we wait and hope, but this movie is unambiguously not the shot we've expected.",Suicide Squad
2244,meenak-84863,"descent movie with good action,comedy but a weak plot",7,8 August 2016,"A VFX aided movie with no good script.The movie gives a adventures plot from various sites like prison and Crime headquarters.Although Will Smith and Margot Robbie gave wonderful performance ,the movie could not provide full entertainment as the story has same usual ending. Action scenes performed by all the artists was awesome and well executed.The movie direction was very good and each character was very well described with some humour involved.The way the movie introduces Batman in few scenes also excites his fans but atlast leave them dishearted as his presence is just for amusement sake.Also the concept is very weak and fails to attract the attention of the movie.The role of Jared Leto as Joker is given less importance which is quite disturbing for the audience.The role of Viola Davis is absolutely unquestionable as well as fully satisfying and enjoying.The movie also revolves around the theme of love and affection which is displayed pretty well.The movie has good mix of humour,romance,action but a common story line makes the movie simply a VFX show.",Suicide Squad
2245,nautaabe,The worst superhero movie i've ever seen.,1,19 December 2016,"And yes, i've seen the green lantern. but that movie was still enjoyable, while this depressing pool of goo wasn't. The lighting was terrible. I know the movie was aiming to be ""dark"", but they took that way too seriously. Half of the time i couldn't see what was happening on the screen. And then the characters. Oh, the characters. I'm just gonna sum up what's wrong with them. Harley Quinn was extremely annoying and basically a punchline machine. Slipknot was dumb (""he can do anything with ropes""), and got his head blown off ten minutes in anyways. Deadshot was just Will Smith playing himself. The joker was an emo kid's interpretation of a crazy person (the editing from scenes with the joker was also really pretentious). The army guy (I forgot his name) was as bland as a hammer to the face. The fire guy was also really weird. Why was he portrayed as sympathetic, while he murdered his own family? Katana was there for no reason at all. And enchantress was just the absolute worst. Summary: I hated it. but it is just an opinion. If you thought that the characters were top of the line, good for you. but i certainly disagree.",Suicide Squad

Katana;s performance was quite poor as she was the only non-English speaking character, however that didn't change my thoughts on the movie.I think the soundtrack was very well thought out and Bohemian Rhapsody, Heathens and Sucker for pain fit the movie very well.I really would go see this movie again tomorrow if i could, i don't know why there is such negativity about it, as i really enjoyed it and can't wait for it to be available for DVD.Don't be put off if you would like to go see it.",Suicide Squad

Super Hero with ton of things going on it not suppose to have a driven plot/story like American Beauty standard. The plot is base of the actions taken and what is needed to stop the villain. It's plain and simple just like most of the Marvel Movies. The character is pretty well acted HQ, Joker, and Deadshot. The Villain is unique. The hater needs to have a better frame of mind going to action movie and expecting to have excellent caliber written. If you want story driven movie go watch a story driven movie and leave this dupe action movie alone. People who enjoy actions, great characters, chemistry amongst the cast, goood pacing, interesting villain will enjoy this movie. It's better than BvS and Thor movies",Suicide Squad
2248,avichoudhary,I won't bet my money on it's success,4,15 August 2016,"SUICIDE SQUADThe only good thing about the movie is that you don't have to blame two persons for this disaster, as the writer and the director is the same person, David Ayer. Suicide Squad starring Will Smith as deadshot, Jared Leto as Joker, Margot Robbie as Joker's manic girlfriend, and a bunch of other actors, was carrying the weight of DC cinematic universe after the not so well reception of ""Dawn of Justice"", which it failed to bear. Amanda Waller(Viola Davis), a government official, recruits a group imprisoned super villains to save the world from the next meta- human who could apparently be a superhero in exchange for clemency and by doing so she instigates the attack herself. Then, we are left with this villain, Enchantress who we know nothing about. The villain is the most messed up character of the movie. She comes out of nowhere, start taking over people and make them do things and it starts feeling like an annoying video game.There is no proper characterization of the characters except for deadshot and Harley Quinn and most of which is also done by excessive flashbacks, yet another case of a messed up DC story. There is not much of a plot in the movie, Margot Robbie did a good job despite of the generic plot and some pretty dumb jokes and dialogues. Most of the marketing was on the Joker and Jared Leto has done a great job in picturizing Joker, but the thing is, he is barely in the movie. we could completely remove all his scenes from the movie, but it would still be the same. There is no proper explanation to his scenes as to why he keeps popping in and out. There is some pretty great imagery and editing but it seems like it is all over the place and it doesn't let any scene breathe. Overall, the movie is disappointing to the level of ""Fantastic Four"", the average viewer will definitely find it below par.",Suicide Squad

2250,rapturecastbuisness,"Average, wasted opportunities.",6,8 August 2016,"Suicide Squad review:I went into this extremely skeptical, but optimistic.Margot Robbie as Harley did not disappoint at all, fantastic acting and script-writing, DC can really go places with this version of Harley Quinn. One thing that bugged me about Harley was the way she dressed, not a major thing, but did annoy me slightly.Will smith's acting was on point as usual, and really fit into this role. Deadshot is another fantastic character and I hope to see more of him in future endeavors by DC. Killer Croc had potential to be a great main character in Suicide Squad, but due to awful scripting and scenes, Croc was wasted.Jared Leto's acting was amazing from what I saw, but I couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed with the amount of stuff that had to be cut, but I live in hope that the deleted scenes will make it onto the home-video release. Cara Delevingne was great, probably the best acting I've personally seen from her. The Enchantress is a great character and Cara played her heart out and brought her to life.The overall storytelling and plot line of Suicide Squad was good, but left a lot to be desired, very fast moving in terms of story, which cut back on the backgrounds of the characters, but the profiles of which were done excellently. The text and graphics that were partnered when introducing the characters was a great touch, really attractively layout and logos for each character. When trying to conserve time in the film, this was definitely the best choice to introduce the characters.Conclusion:Suicide Squad was a good movie, with a lot to niggle at, and plot holes that were left unfilled. The acting was outstanding from Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Will Smith and Jai Courtney. I was impressed with the choice of songs that were used in the soundtrack, some great older tunes that really fit the feel of the movie. The overall feel of the film wasn't as colonel or edgy as it seemed, but the gritty, dark nature of DC films lately fit the Suicide Squad just right. I would love to see these characters in movies of their own films / in a future DC movie. Final score: 6.5/10",Suicide Squad
2251,prettyotter,Incoherent and sexist,2,8 August 2016,"Suicide Squad is a messy attempt to cash in on the edgy humor that made Deadpool so popular. Unlike Deadpool, however, this movie has a difficult to discern plot and 9/10 jokes flop. A big chunk of the movie's philosophy is what edgy weeaboos use to justify their pointless obsession with hating on people who they perceive as ""normal"". But what really bothers me about this movie is its portrayal of women. Harley Quinn is ~madly in love~ with the Joker, rather than being a victim of manipulation and abuse. June Moon has her autonomy taken away from her almost immediately, Katana hardly talks, and Amanda Walker has no redeeming qualities. One of the weirdest parts of the movie to me is when Amanda Walker walks into Harley Quinn's cell, and Harley, who apparently doesn't know her or anything about her, immediately asks if she's the devil. Harley Quinn sees a black woman who she knows nothing about, and the first thing out of her mouth is ""Are you the Devil?"". And in the movie, that's okay. The movie doesn't do anything to address how the Joker abuses Harley. Everyone is just okay with it. Harley's deeper character is taken for granted and she's just turned into this man- candy with excessive booty shots every two minutes.",Suicide Squad
2252,magnusvoster,I must be one of the few who actually thought it was a decent movie,10,8 August 2016,"Despite being an avid comic-book reader, and also a firm believer that Heath Ledgers Joker could not be topped, I actually liked Jared Leto as the joker. People say they felt it was too forced, but i disagree. He took his own twist on the role, as the DC universe has done countless times in the comics. Some Jokers are bad ass mobsters, while others are hilarious psychopaths with little to no regard for the people around them. Leto portrayed this joker as the latter, and i think he was amazing. The super dysfunctional relationship between him and Harley Quinn was my favorite part of the entire movie, if we look away from the fact that Will Smith absolutely killed his role as Deadshot, but come on, its Will Smith. Of course he nailed it. All in all, my personal opinion is that it was epic. The Joker laugh, Margot Robbies awesome portrayal and my favorite line; ""whats for dinner?""If there are any spelling/grammar mistakes i apologize. English is not my first language.I hope the actors and directors don't get too much hate. Because, it was new, different, and not what I expected, but it was awesome.",Suicide Squad
2253,prominensofficial,This movie is amazing.,9,8 August 2016,"I don't know what's wrong with the critics nowadays, are they so jumpy on the Marvel Hype Train that they must hate every single type of competition, or any other reason, all I can say is that movie extremely pushes the DC Cinematic Universe into the fray alongside Marvel and that the movie is a Cinematographic marvel and that the casting is perfect.Margot Robbie is the best choice in the world for the psychotic Harley Quinn, alongside Jared Leto as her counterpart love they are an amazing couple, with the scenes of them together in their classic clothes, are just awesome. Jared Leto could have had more screen time in the movie as he feels unused and underrated. Will Smith also shines as Deadshot and I see no better choice for that role cast. The other characters while also underused are a very good addition to the squad, with El Diablo being my personal favorite.The comedy in the movie is spot on, no ""cheesyness"" like others would have you believe, and the whole theater hall laughed out loud a couple of times. In conclusion, the movie is an amazing adaptation for the Suicide Squad comics and we can only hope for a sequel. Never listen to the cancer sites like Rotten Tomatoes, and if you really have to, read the audience reviews rather than the critics, because all they really do is, criticize.",Suicide Squad
2254,adambenmhend,Suicide Squad is a meh movie saved by its cast,6,8 August 2016,"Suicide Squad suffers from the same disease as last year's Fant4stic: it's a lackluster movie that had the potential to be mind-blowing. Although the visuals are great, the directing sucks. Much like Batman v. Superman, the first act is hilariously overedited, feeling awkward and disjointed, like a huge hour long trailer for the film. There's a bunch of montages to introduce all the members of the squad except for like two, who straight up appear out of nowhere. The second act feels generic and uninspiring, but the endgame finally feels kind of adequate, despite its' random use of slow-mo in the final battle. Other problems I had with the directing was that a major sacrifice really lacked weight to the point that I thought said character was going to come back in the end (so basically just like Quicksilver in Age of Ultron) and that the movie was just filled to the brim with flashbacks, sometimes even unnecessarily repeating them, like Batman v. Superman did, and puts them in some pretty weird places. That last problem might be very much a consequence of introducing a whole lot of characters with large backstories that haven't starred in previous films before.The plot was also pretty lame. Suicide Squad/Task Force X is supposed to go on deep cover black ops missions, but this film just put them on the generic ""defeat the villain/save the city"" type deal, which is highly disappointing. The villain was also pretty disappointing, and had no depth (despite the studio's desperate attempts to inject depth into it). Also there's a whole lot of scenes that would be kind of cool on their own, but feel completely out of place when inserted into the actual plot. Another problem with the writing in general is that this movie is one of those that tell all the good jokes in the trailers. The best thing about this movie by far is its cast, but like the X- Men franchise, not everyone gets a chance to shine. At some points, it just feels like the Harley/Deadshot show. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is fantastic, and gets the character really well. My only problem with her is her interactions with Joker, but I'll get to that later. Will Smith's Deadshot is also one of the best characters in the film, getting a lot of screen time and great lines but he feels just like your standard smartass Will Smith character, lacking the true moral grayness of Floyd from the comics. Other outstanding cast members are Jay Courtney's Captain Boomerang, who despite being utterly useless compared to the other members of the squad is a great source of comic relief and fantastic character in general, and Viola Davis' Amanda Waller, who is probably the most comics-accurate character out of all the cast. The rest of the cast is either completely reduced to the background like Katana and Killer Croc, who gets only a couple of good lines in between the occasional snarl, or attempt to give the film some ethos but fall short due to mediocre storytelling, like El Diablo and Rick Flagg. The worst character by far is Cara Delevigne's Enchantress, who probably was the most inadequate out of all the main cast in terms of both acting and writing.Then, there's Jared Leto's Joker. I was honestly scared that he was going to steal the show away from the rest of the cast, but he literally does the complete opposite. He's featured so very little in the film, that I honestly can't get a good read on the performance. He also suffers the same problem Spider-Man has in Civil War as in he doesn't really need to be in the movie at all. Another problem I had with him was relationship with Harley is pretty problematic, seeing that it should be a mostly manipulative and screwed up with some occasional beautiful moments of ""true love"", but in the movie, it's 99% ""true love"". Jokley should NOT be relationship goals.Overall, this movie is arguably one of the biggest letdowns of 2016, but definitely still worth a watch. 6.5/10 stars; the best things about it were its cast, costume design, and marketing campaign.",Suicide Squad
2255,thatsrighteveryday,Great superhero move. That's it. That's all we need.,10,8 August 2016,"I'll keep this short: I read a hell of a lot of reviews and comments about the movie before going. Many people said it was worse than BTMNvsSPRMN, said it was ""terrible"" and ""disappointing"". Absolutely not.Just before it started I said to myself I should only compare this to marvel movies like Captain America or Iron Man. And so I did.Compared to the other superhero movies this was just as enjoyable! The story-line was decent, the introduction was brilliant, the action-scenes were great. The humor kept everything together and wasn't as clichéd/cringy as a lot of marvel movies are now-days. And to top it all off: The music was spot-on!

2256,accountpasswordsecurity,"Okay, cheesy, and predictable.",6,9 August 2016,"I want to start by saying I knew nothing about Suicide Squad until this movie and I still know nothing other than what I've seen from the movie. Okay, with that being said I enjoyed the movie and I may watch it 1-2 more times and perhaps buy it. It wasn't anything amazing but I didn't expect it to be. When you get into the movie it sets up everyone and their stories and I feel like this dragged on and was kinda boring, I personally only took and interest in Deadshot, Joker, and Harley's stories. The rest felt kinda unnecessary. Everyone had a love story literally everyone! I personally didn't like the cast for joker, He didn't fit the part in my opinion but he did okay for being an actor I've never heard of but I could name tons of actors I think could do much better than him. I didn't really like how they portrayed the Joker and Harley either. They literally made him an insane pimp and Harley was his only hoe. The Enchantress was a stupid enemy the entire time she seemed like she had the power to instantly kill everyone and everything. At the end they made her do a lot of weird waving around and made her look like an idiot. They fought her for like 10 minutes and then she was like... Oh yeah I have powers and disarmed everyone and said enough. So they wasted so much time with that. The comedy was very cheesy and I think if Will Smith wasn't in the movie it would of hardcore failed. I look forward to seeing a second and hopefully it is better than the first but if not, no big deal. They made it clearly obvious who was expendable in the movie so a lot of things were easy to predict. Overall I would rate this movie a 6 and say it was worth watching once. This was my first review so thanks for reading guys!",Suicide Squad
2257,hellraier-31936,Good....... But........... Minor Spoilers,8,9 August 2016,"As a huge DC fan I couldn't wait to see this film, most of it didn't disappoint. If you have read new 52 suicide squad this is so true to the comics you won't be disappointed. Robbie and Smith are fantastic and the plot is fun although it misses most of the laugh out loud moments a MCU film has. Lots of folks are talking about the tonal shift half was through (which is more like 25% of the way in) but that made sense to me. The squad start in prison, have nothing to loose and the film demonstrates that by bring jovial. Later in as they are put on a suicide mission their bad ass nature emerges and proves why these guys are in super max. Then the bad, and I mean horrific......I love the joker, I have him tattooed on my body, I like 30 seconds to Mars Jared Leto's band but the combination of the 2 left a very sour taste.When he first appeared I thought I got where they where going, not wanting to copy Nolans/Ledgers vision of the character they where turning him into a psycho mob boss, the novelty lasted 30 seconds to hell then I wanted to see him gone. This portrayal has no redeeming features, he is naff beyond all belief, just horrid. And this isn't in a Joffrey GoT style it's he's so hammy you want to walk out when he's on screen. This film will be great on blu-ray where the joker parts but all in all very much enjoyed",Suicide Squad
2258,venkpallette,"There are good bad movies, then there is suicide squad.",3,9 August 2016,"By that I mean a bad movie can be enjoyable when it seems innocently bad. Like the room and such. Then there are movies that are the true definition of bad. Movies without heart, or charm, or the care that should be put into an art form such as a film. Suicide squad, is one of the truly bad bad movies. I'll highlight the things that bothered me most and try to keep this short. 1: none of the characters are the characters we know and love. None. They feel like cosplayers making a home movie about the characters they like. Except cosplayers are better actors. Especially Robbie. 2: none of these characters are relevant. Except for deadshot, and Harley. Everyone else takes a backseat. Boomerang is ignored. Croc is ignored. And diablo is sort of in between. 3: these characters are diminutive in comparison to their enemy. Suicide squad is made up of, loony girl with bat, sniper guy, crocodile person, fire spitter, and man with boomerang. Their enemy? Literal ancient gods with unbelievable power. Superman can battle something like that and it make sense. Not the suicide squad. They feel so out of place. The entire story is ruined by this oversight. 4: everyone uses urban slang. Literally, everyone. Even the ancient gods they are fighting use slang terms. Because its cool I guess? It really destroys the already messy feel of the film. 5: nothing is coherent. Everything is broken. The plot just kind of happens in front of you without explanation. What is that thing? Why is that person doing what they are doing? The movie never says, it just expects you to know. 6: rather than show the insanity of the movies main attraction, let's instead highlight it to you by having everyone say ""damn bitch you crazy"" on repeat. Throughout the film you never get any real insanity from Harley. Instead you are just reminded she's off her rocker by characters telling her she is. All. The. Time. 7: was this group assembled because of their abilities? What abilities? We never see them. The movie never makes use of any characters abilities which got them in suicide squad in the first place. The only who does is deadshot, who gets a couple decent scenes. Boomerang maybe throws a single boomerang, you hear Harleys bat crack, croc growls, and diablo is too scared to use his powers but once throughout the movie. That's it. Why create a movie with all these good characters then do nothing with them? 8: what's wrong with you people? In one scene flag, the army guy (that's all his character really is) that has been left in control of the squad gets triggered when Harley smashes a window to steal a purse. He then yells ""what's wrong with you people?!"" You have a team of known insane people and criminals. Who wrote this line? And there are others like it throughout the film! 9: Harleys butt. This is the only focus of her character. Her butt gets more screen time than her characters mental intricacies. Its clear that was the only reason she was involved with this film and this use of her butt is disgraceful and an embarrassment. There. That's a few highlights. I could go on for 1000 more lines. But I won't. Just don't waste money to see this. Don't let warner justify this films horrible existence. They don't deserve the right.",Suicide Squad
2259,darkvindikall,Several misdemeanors.,3,9 August 2016,"If you are looking for non-stop action on a hot summer day then sure it may be the movie for you. If you are looking for proper structure within story and dialogue then this is probably not for you. Transitions are a point I will highlight, when handling a transition from one scene to the next, you don't just abruptly cut to a big section of the movie without a good transition, which I think is a real highlight in what they could have done better. A positive highlight for me is the noticeably good animation, we were speculating what it would be like to watch while high, and that is up for VICELAND to experiment with. The Joker... Creepy yes, however you can see bits of Jared Leto trying too hard to be the next best thing, all in all he was fine. Harley Quinn was fine, Deadshot was fine, the rest were a bit sloppy in story telling and my least favorites Captain Boomerang and Killer Croc had scenes in which you can see the writers were desperate for a laugh when this type of humor only created some giggles in the audience. I'm sure I'm missing some other big issue with the story because there are many, nevertheless I see it as a good movie if you want action but not story. 3/10",Suicide Squad
2260,vfashanu,Critics exaggerated,9,9 August 2016,"So like any other fan out there I waited for the suicide squad movie, but before I saw the movie they where a lot of negative reports from critics. But thank God I didn't let the critics put me off going to see the DC COMICS SUICIDE SQUAD live movie because I had a blast watching it and I feel like the negative feedback from critics where highly exaggerated. Firstly Harley Quinn's ass was not the main spot light, she's a sexy naughty criminal and she was portrayed that way. I loved every moment and wasn't even disappointed about Cara being the bad guy, she actually pulled it off quite well. And as always great graphics, I always love to see the development of tech and computer graphics on the big screen.",Suicide Squad
2261,thebubfusion,Not DC's best,6,9 August 2016,"The movie was not horrible, but no masterpiece. Few moments in the movie really hooked me in. The parts that did hook me in did a good job. I thought act 1 was good. I liked the idea of learning the back stories to some of the major characters. Then from act 1 to the bar scene I found to be boring. The wandering through the city, and going against minions that stood no chance and were easily taken down . I liked the bar scene because of El Diablo's back story. The whole killing of his family made the scene more emotional. The final battle was OK. Wasn't too amazing, wasn't too bad. I found this movie to be very predictable. Some examples were Amanda Waller not dying, Harley not being shot by Deadshot, the joker to be still alive, enchantress to be the villain, and the squad to win. These are just some examples. Some pros to the movie were Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Deadshot by Will Smith, the Joker by Jared Leto (many will disagree) and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. The movie looked nice. Some more cons are unneeded characters (slipknot), scenes that had no real explaining on why they are happening, and the lack of other squad members. This movie is a hit or miss. Not the best work by DC",Suicide Squad
2262,vorlonsphere-85657,Awesome film,10,9 August 2016,"I saw it 4 days ago and I loved it. The plot was relatively simple to follow, and honestly, because there are so many characters to build, I preferred that the plot be straightforward like this so it's not very confusing. And, the entire theater I was in, which was packed, were laughing all the time and seem to be enjoying the whole thing. You gotta wonder if the critics were taking the movie too seriously to even grasp it. I loved it and that's all I really care about. I will agree that there were some pacing issues, but for me they were relatively minor. I will concede, however, that it was apparent that there were some scenes that were cut, specifically lines that we saw in the trailer. If you come in not knowing about those lines, you wouldn't know they're missing, but if you were waiting for those lines, you'd notice their absence. Was it enough to ruin the film? Hells no. There were also some stylistic choices that arguably could've been done better. But, as I said, overall I was happy with the film. I've seen it twice and I'm planning a third watching.",Suicide Squad
2263,bethdavies-62830,Not as bad as it's been made out to be,7,9 August 2016,"I went to the cinema to see Suicide Squad with pretty low expectations if I'm honest. After reading numerous reviews by critics that made this film sound pretty much unbearable, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this really wasn't the case. Granted, it's not the best film I've ever seen, but it was definitely enjoyable to watch. Margot Robbie absolutely nailed the role of Harley Quinn, I couldn't get enough of her. Absolutely amazing. I thought that the vast majority of the other characters were brilliant as well, particularly Deadshot and Captain Boomerang. Although it is an aspect that I've seen mixed reviews on also, I loved the soundtrack and thought that it fitted really well with the film. However there were some bad points where I was beginning to understand the discontent towards the film. Firstly, I thought that Cara Delevingne was a truly atrocious actress. Every line she spoke was wooden, boring and almost made me cringe. I think that casting her was a huge mistake. Secondly, some parts were a bit naff and overdone (note, several overuses of never ending slow-mo). I also would've liked to have seen more of the Joker - from what I saw of him, I thought that Leto's portrayal of him did the role justice, but seeing as the advertising for the film is largely centered around his character, there really could've been more of him. Overall, I think Suicide Squad really is worth the watch and undeserving of the bad reviews it's been given.",Suicide Squad
2264,mieke-77920,Entertaining but misses out on the last stretch.,4,9 August 2016,"It's OK, the first part is really good but after that it loses the plot a bit. Harley Quinn is pretty good, but sometimes her lines fall flat. Her comedic timing is iffy and sometimes seems a bit forced. It's hard to tell if the Joker is good or not as his scenes are a bit random and very short, sometimes I think perhaps removing him until the end and letting him be a teaser would've been a better idea as he's not part of the story at all. Deadshot is basically Will Smith so it depends if you like him or not! The Enchantress was good I was pleasantly surprised. SPOILER Diablo was built up and then killed off really fast for no reasonable reason, there was a really good twist they could've taken and they didn't. Overall characters were underdeveloped, I felt that neither Harley nor the Joker had the complexity that comic and media representations of them have had before, and the writing definitely doesn't complement Margot Robbie at times but makes her seem awkward. Nothing's really said about Killer Croc or Boomerang, and the Enchantress' story line is also a little vague. It tries to put too much into too short a time and misses some really key routes to really push the characters into our hearts and develop them. There are some really funny moments provided by Boomerang. I don't think the PG-13 rating helps this. I would say go see it at some point, it's entertaining, but it's not really well- thought through towards the end. I don't feel that these guys are really that evil, ironically Amanda Waller does the most evil in this whole movie and comes across more unpleasant than the majority of the 'bad guys' in the Suicide Squad ...",Suicide Squad
2265,kaiannyoung,Major Disappointment,1,9 August 2016,"The plot didn't have any buildup or development. I mean really, it was 2 hours of random nothing. The characters didn't have enough coverage of their actual back stories. It didn't seem like it was directed by someone who understood them and looked into the comics. Will Smith was given the typical funny kind of role which was disappointing. I wanted to take him a little more seriously. That also goes for the film in general, I wanted to take it more seriously. But with all the cheesy jokes I couldn't. The amount of times I scoffed every time the crocodile opened his mouth. Why was he given any lines? BET? Really? It had to be a black guy playing him. I wondered why they wasted Jared Leto's time. They didn't showcase his adaptation of the joker enough, he was just a part of Harley's backstory. Margot's acting was great as expected but Harley was completely objectified. We all know Harley had some sex appeal. We all can see Margot is very attractive. Scenes of her dancing on poles, licking the jail bar, and guys ogling at her was total overkill to me. We should've seen the real crazy that Harley is. Was there anything else they could've aided off of her character other than a few funny lines, her looks, and some voices in her head? Come on. We should've seen the twisted relationship between her and the Joker not some romanticized fairy tale version. The Joker kissing? LOL. And texting? Omg! Some characters did absolutely nothing for the plot. Cara's acting is bad and the hip twisting didn't save her. My conclusion is that this film was a underdeveloped and cliché mess. Only teeny boppers would find that kind of humor funny. Only simple minded people would thoroughly enjoy this.",Suicide Squad
2266,devn-40360,Fun movie. Worth the price of entry. Better than what it's being bashed for,8,10 August 2016,Honestly. You should go watch it for yourself and decide yourself. The movie seems to be very decisive. Me personally. I loved it. It was fun. It had heart. And the action and soundtrack was riveting. The story could have been better but as far as a superhero movies goes. It's on par with the usual. Evil wants to take over. And a group of rag heroes or anti heroes in this case has to stop it. Nothing overly complex. But most superhero movies really aren't. Great cast that seem to engage well with each other. Good cgi. I'll definitely watch it again. And I really hope for a sequel. The possibilities are quite interesting with this story line. But I've seen some reviews completely bashing this movie for doing things that any other movie gets praised for. You'd have to be a fool to think the story was too messy to understand. It was straight forward. Editing was a bit choppy in the middle but nothing that puts you off the movie. And people don't seem to know how the rating system works. Giving it 1 star in the hopes of just bringing down the score. When it's obvious this movie doesn't deserve anywhere near 1 star. This isn't the avatar the last air bender movie. Sad really considering this movie is definitely worth the price of a ticket. And it has the necessities of an above average summer blockbuster. Go watch it and decide for yourself.,Suicide Squad
2267,LeMat87,High expectations... very disappointed.,4,12 August 2016,"I had been waiting a long time for this movie to come out, and as a comic book reader and fan, I was really excited about watching it with my girlfriend at the drive in! Long story short: the plot was so boring and uncompelling that we both ended up not caring about the movie anymore... Although some of the characters are very well played and interesting, the story simply did not deliver.So on the way there, I was excited to watch it, but about halfway through... I was kinda hoping it would end soon to watch the second movie... This is my honest personal opinion, but I would not recommend spending your hard earned money on this movie. It's still watchable if you're a fan of the genre but you should wait for it to come out on DVD and/or Netflix and such.That being said, Thank you for reading, and have a nice day!",Suicide Squad
2268,jbeancb,Well Executed (no pun intended),7,10 August 2016,"I will start out with the fact that I am not a huge comic book fan. I have had friends growing up who are super into comic books and who would give me the run down on each super hero movie coming out. I do, however, enjoy a well made Marvel or DC movie that keeps me entertained and throws a curve ball at some point in the movie. Unfortunately, many comic book movies, whether you've read the comics or not, tend to be very predictable. Suicide Squad, however, was unusual in this aspect. It seemed that the movie kept you on the edge of your seat so often, that there was no time for predicting. I believe this movie appealed to the artsy crowd with it's variety of colors and unique animation techniques. That was one thing that stood out to me. And as for the ever-pressing Joker argument... Jared Leto did play an incredibly creepy and uncomfortable Joker. Nonetheless, I do not think anyone will ever surpass the performance put on by Heath Ledger. Leto did well considering what he had to follow up, and perhaps he played a better ""comic- book-Joker,"" but Ledger will forever remain the best Joker in my books. All in all a well written screenplay and well executed plot, with fun characters from Will Smith's Deadshot and Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. Despite the plethora of critique, I would recommend Suicide Squad.",Suicide Squad
2269,pelechr-36951,Good action. Poorly written,2,10 August 2016,"There was good action, good special effects. The jokes were not that funny. The movie seemed rushed to introduce everybody. Some parts were just stupid, making me cringe. The plot was terrible and could have been written better. The critics got this one right. This movie does not deserve more than 1/5 stars. It's fun to watch don't get me wrong but it just goes to show you how they can throw a bunch of popular songs in there, with a famous actor, and try to get you to watch it. And you will. And that's all they care about. This is why they also set up the movie for a sequel at the end. It's all about money and really lacks passion for film making, that's why this movie sucked. Save your money.",Suicide Squad
2270,rbera-41269,Couldn't do justice with the Joker..!!,6,10 August 2016,"Let me start off by saying that like every other DC fan I was hell excited about Suicide Squad. Not just because that I love the characters but because of the cast involved. From Will Smith appearing as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, to Jai Courtney as Boomerang and Jay Hernandaz as Diablo. They were all amazing throughout the movie and did exactly what was expected of them. I even liked Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. She played the role wonderfully from the very beginning to the end of the movie so did Cara Delevingne as June Moone / The Enchantress.And Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman once again proved himself to be excellent. I won't regret saying that he was born for this role. Even though he wasn't there that much in the movie except for 2-3 scenes. He still manages to prove that he is the one. The way he fits in the character is just excellent. No doubt he is gonna nail it in Justice League.But most of all.. the reason why I was more excited for this movie was Jared Leto. From the very first trailer that came out he was looking astonishing. Not to mention that he made the fans go nuts over him. He is different and looks really cool while portraying Joker. Almost all of his scenes are absolutely amazing but having said that.. he is barely seen in the movie. We only get to see him 5-6 times in the whole movie and that too just for few seconds. That is where it disappoints and ruins it all because the marketing made us believe that he has a heavy role in it which in reality is nothing more than just a cameo. There's not even a single moment that belongs to him. He hasn't even got a proper scene of himself laughing like ha.. ha.. ha.. So talking about the movie.. Its surely worth watching but not thinking about the Joker.. Don't go to this movie being excited about Jared Leto as the Joker because you are gonna regret it. David Ayyer will surely make you think if Joker was really needed for this movie or not. Watch it just for fun and you won't be disappointed much.",Suicide Squad

I am also in love with Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Everyone did an amazing job! They all connected with their characters very well and you can tell they are a squad in real life. The costumes were amazing too! I also loved how they added humor in this movie. There were lots of scenes that were genuinely funny and it made me love the movie even more. I am extremely impressed with everything! I've never been so obsessed with a movie before and I've completely fallen in love with the whole cast. This film was absolutely amazing and any critic who thinks otherwise is more crazy than the characters in Suicide Squad!,Suicide Squad
2274,The_Jester_Of_Genocide,A Magnificent Mess That Is Both Extraordinarily Fun And Entertaining DESPITE Itself..,10,12 August 2016,"In SQUAD We Trust! I've never seen a movie like this. Coming out of the cinema I didn't know what to think. It's both Incredible yet Inept, Amazing yet Awful, SPECTACULAR yet substandard.If I had to describe it in one sentence, I'd say: ""It's a very flawed film that somehow still manages to be a tremendously entertaining ride from start to finish!""First off, I.LOVE.THESE.VILLAINS. The ""Worst of the Worst."" This might be the definition of character driven piece. Margot Robbie steals the show in what I consider her best performance yet as former Psychologist turned Psychopath Harleen ""Harley Quinn"" Quinzel. Fans of the comic's and the award winning cartoon B:TAS will rejoice as Robbie brings Quinn to life, perfectly capturing the comically quirky yet crazy essence that has made the character so popular for all this time. Will Smith SHINES As Floyd Lawton AKA Deadshot, an assassin who misses his daughter.. But NEVER misses a shot. Although Smith's acting doesn't stray far from his usual comfort zone, I will say that it's been a LONG time since I've seen him THIS charismatic and funny. Given great dialogue, Smith deliver's it effortlessly, finally flexing those comedic chops that have fallen rather flat throughout the years.Viola Davis IS Amanda Waller. Cold Blooded. Cruel. Calculating. This is 'The Wall'.Jay Hernandez is another stand out. Surprisingly, El Diablo was a substantial part of the film and added some much needed heart. I can't say more without delving into spoiler territory but let's just say he provides a 'fire' for the squad (pun intended). AND Finally, Jai Courtney!.. I can't believe I'm going to say this BUT... Courtney's HILARIOUS in this. His Captain Boomerang is a fun alcoholic who just isn't given enough screen time, in my opinion. I LOVED what I saw and I hope he makes further appearances in the DCU!Everybody else was ""Okay"". Killer Croc got some laughs in my screening but I found him rather bland and dull. Delevingne's Enchantress was entertaining in certain portions but overall was weak and forgettable. Makes you wonder why Ayers had her strip naked and run in the woods at night if this is the best they could do with the character. Slipknots very minor, Flag is boring, and Katana is criminally underused. Now, i'm sure everyone's wondering about Jared Leto's Joker. Unfortunately, he's given so little to do that you really don't know what to make him. AND THIS is where this film starts to fall apart. The Editing and Pacing is horrendous. The tone is all over the place. Ayers has said they had 6 different cuts before they settled on the final version and you can tell. It literally seems like 6 different movies ""stitched"" together in an attempt to form one cohesive piece. I don't know who's responsible for this but whoever it was should probably be fired. NO scenes are fleshed out as the movie jumps so much, it never lets you soak in anything as it attempts to almost drive itself to a very lackluster finale. I think the term is ""Franken-Flick.""This is what hurt Joker as well. He seemed like he was certainly from a different cut. Leto's portrayal is unique but you are never really prepared to see him on screen and when you do, the editing is so poor and jarring, you're left confused as to what exactly you just saw.According to multiple sources including Leto himself, there was enough footage shot for a Joker film yet he's reduced to 10 min. of total (and scattered) screen time. The scenes in question are said to be from the immensely popular ""Mad Love"" story line that showcased the origin of Harley Quinn. Hopefully we get an extended cut with these scenes included. It's a shame because there are parts where Leto completely disappears and all I see is The Joker from the panels of the comics. Then there are parts where he seems more like sad clown than clown prince of crime (More on that Later).The plot of this movie starts okay, but turns incredibly generic and simple fairly quick. You've seen it a thousand times before in a thousand comic book movies before. Nothing really to talk about here. It's the same for the villain. Basically, generic comic book villain #126.Overall, this is a good movie. I know it seems hard to believe with my critique towards the end but that should tell you just HOW GREAT these characters are. Perfection personified. This is a very enjoyable and entertaining flick succeeding in finally etching a solid entry into the DCU. I am looking forward to seeing more of these characters in the future! Biggest Problem: Joker and Harley's relationship. It's no secret that it isn't the ""best."" For lack of a better term, He beats her. It's Harley's Stockholm Syndrome that helps make her a more sympathetic character.This is a chore trait to these characters as their relationship should give you a glimpse into both their psyche AND their psychotic nature. I fail to see how people can't stomach things like this but are perfectly fine with murder. The lower common denominator of the population just can't seem to separate ""Portrayal"" from ""Glorification"" but that's the world we live in I suppose. Here, Joker uncharacteristically loves Harley. Early cut's did have the abusive aspect of their relationship, however audiences tested poorly so these scenes were reedited while some were removed to make Joker and Harley appear more caring, apparently forgetting these are villains.I rate this movie 10/10 just for the sheer fun and entertainment I had watching these crazy characters together. As a film overall, I'd give it an 8/10, excelling past BvS and MoS as the best DC movie SINCE the Dark Knight.",Suicide Squad
2275,harshulsinghal,One Time Watch!,7,12 August 2016,"The movie is quite cool. The crazy role of Harley Quinn keeps you till the end. Too much of co-incidence in the movie and too much of characters with very short roles is really disappointing. Graphics are good but not the best. Below Expectations. Also, they have missed many crucial things in the movie and left it unexplained. Joker's comeback in the film after being crashed and survival of June after destruction of Enchantress is still a suspense. This time DC has included post- credits in its movie for Justice League. That was a good one as it showed Aqua-Man and Flash. The overall movie was fun but could have been better. If you are a DC Comics fan, a must watch for you.",Suicide Squad
2276,Smacks76,Should have been better.,5,11 August 2016,"I wanted to really like this movie, but it falls short in too many areas. First let me say the movie is mostly entertaining. Will Smith did a better job than anyone imho. I really enjoyed his performance and his costume looked pretty awesome. The very first action sequence was very well done. Again, Will Smith stole the show in that scene, especially near the end. Now on to the bad:90% of the ""funny"" lines just didn't deliver, meaning no one in the theater laughed. The 10% that were actually funny were delivered by Will Smith. The attempt at humor was just kind of lame for all the others, especially Harley (no matter how easy she is on the eyes).Special effects changed here and there, enough to be distracting. They looked amazing at times and disappointing at others. I find that annoying in any movie.I found the bar scene to be just stupid. I was watching it and couldn't get The Breakfast Club out of my head since its what it reminded me of. I found it really pathetic and it should have been omitted from the film.The Joker looked cool and was portrayed well, he just needed more screen time in order to make the movie better.I found myself laughing at Katana the whole time. The character just wasn't portrayed well and the costume looked kinda stupid to me.Amanda Waller in this movie is nothing but Mrs. Frederick from Warehouse 13 on the SyFy channel. I'm sure it wasn't intentional, but I found Waller to be an unoriginal character anyway.",Suicide Squad
2277,amysheplovesdisney,I would put it on as a background movie😕,4,11 August 2016,"So me watching this film was a spur of the moment kind of thing. I wasn't expecting it to be great but I was expecting at least some good aspects. I liked the Joker. I don't know why everyone is giving him so much hate, I thought he did fine. He took a more modern twist on the character which I thought worked with the tone of the movie. I looked forward to his scenes and wish he had more. I really liked Harley. Like the joker I was excited when she was in a scene and thought her character was very well done. She was cutesy, she was bad-ass and she was human. I also liked Deadshot. I liked that we had a backstory on him, I liked that he wasn't all bad; he had some snarky lines and I liked that. I would say the only problem is that when I looked at him I saw Will Smith, but then again I suppose it's hard not to see him considering he's such a well know guy. But besides those three characters, I didn't like anything else. I found the plot all to messy. I was an hour into the film and I had little to know clue what was going on. The Enchantess was rushed and her character was weirdly payed. I also though that June and the guy she was with didn't have any chemistry. All in all, some characters are good but it doesn't save the messy plot and the crummy editing.",Suicide Squad

Somehow, this film still sits at a 7/10 which is wildly out of its reach.The characters in this movie are awful. The first half of this movie is dedicated towards developing them and setting them up, but it's entirely useless, making it really boring. Everything that has to do with characterization is done through exposition. You rarely see the characters actually exhibit the traits they're supposed to have, and when they do, it's really forced. Will Smith's character is pretty much the main character, and he suffers from this the most. His character revolves around his care for his daughter. Instead of us viewers actually being able to see their relationship and understand it, this vital piece of information is literally given through another character's voice over in which they state, ""(Will Smith's character's) weakness is his daughter."" For the rest of the movie, we're just expected to accept this and it feels really artificial. There is no real characterization, only shoehorned exposition. Margot Robbie's character is in the movie because she's attractive. She does nothing except annoy me and her characterization is even worse than Will Smith's. And oh my God, the Joker. Now, it'd be unfair to compare him to Heath Ledger, but Jared Leto's Joker is definitely the worst part of this movie. He's only in the movie to provide exposition for Margot Robbie's character and to give her any character at all. He provides nothing else for the movie except just making it worse every time he steps into the frame with his godawful performance. He's just bland, uninteresting, and completely useless, and every time he's in a scene, you're desperately waiting for it to end. There is also barely any plot. If the story had centered around one of the characters it may have been the slightest bit interesting, but as I mentioned before, any emphasis given to the characters is really bad. Instead, the entire movie is about beating all the generic enemies in the room and then advancing to the next level until you reach the really boring final boss. Everything else in the movie is just leading up to these final moments, and it's very dissatisfying. The ending battles of this movie are pretty much the ending battles of the Avengers movies, except much worse because all the characters suck, too. If I have to say anything good about this movie, I'll say that a small percentage of things going on looked cool and somewhat satisfying, and I laughed at a lot of the jokes. While Margot Robbie's character was awful, her performance was pretty entertaining to watch when it wasn't annoying. There are obviously movies far worse than Suicide Squad, which is why Im going to let it sit on a 3/10. But this was definitely the least enjoyable and most forgettable superhero movie I've seen in the recent wave of them.",Suicide Squad
2279,knotpartybus,Ruined potential,2,11 August 2016,"They took what should have been great characters and villains and wrote a crappy script as if they have never seen or read anything with the actual characters before. It's like some big shot movie money investor gave them a one page description to sum up all the characters and that's what they went with. The Joker was horrible, Jared Leto was the worst Joker ever. Shaved eyebrows and tattoos?? And his smile was not a crazy grin like it should have been. He looked like Macauley Culkin from home alone and he sucked. And the relationship between The Joker and Harley was completely wrong. He manipulates her and couldn't care if she died in the least, but in this movie he's all about her. And even though Harley Quinn is a great character they couldn't get that right either. She is the Joker's sidekick. She is supposed to be Joker/card themed. That's why she has spades (like from a deck of cards) as part of her look. But in this she has some whored out baseball player theme?? So lame. And they tried to make her funny, but her one liners just fell short of the mark. Although she was one of the better parts of the movie. The plot was complete garbage. The final villain battle ""climax"" was pathetic. Just another of many poor choices and ruined opportunities. The DC universe has soooo many awesome villains they could have worked with and they put together this complete waste of time. Even all the members of The Suicide Squad (other than Harley) was basically changed into the same cookie cutter generic character of a goth, dark leather, tattoo, punk, biker wanna be, lame-ass. Deadshot, Harley and Waller were the only things that kept me from giving it a one star. But they were by no means great, or saved the movie in any way. And now this pathetic, lame, annoying, weak ass version of the Joker, with Jared Leto's shitty, method-acting bullshit is going to be in the Justice League. This studio needs to fire a lot of people and start over. I don't know how DC can make all their animated movies with such awesome plots and stay true to the characters, and then they just throw that all out the window and make a complete toilet clogging dump for the big screen movie.",Suicide Squad
2280,dantomin,Already Needs a Reboot...,2,11 August 2016,"Let me start by saying I am not a huge super hero movie fan, but I do enjoy the genre. Upon seeing the trailer for this film I was super excited because the concept was so different, much like Dead Pool (which was an awesome movie btw). This movie HAD SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE AN ALL TIME GREAT, but it was a complete and utter mess. The overall plot was choppy, rushed, and just terrible from its lack of back story, it's odd yet lame villain, and it's run of the mill ""humanity will end by the hands of a doomsday device"". The script was horribly written and many characters did not speak enough to have any sort of background information given (ex: killer croc, the guy who shows up and dies before any action- I don't even know the guy's name). The jokers minimal screen time and utter uselessness to the plot was extremely aggravating. Batman and other Heros absences (with the exception of superman) were unexplained which was also aggravating. The flashback scenes were only really for Harley Quinn and dead shot which made them protagonists despite the movies claims of a team. The editing was a mess and the introductions of each antihero were extremely cheesy. Katanas forced and unexplained insertion to the team was mind boggling and Joel kinnamans characters love interest in enchantress wasn't well explained which lead me to not care about either character. Getting back to the flashbacks, many of the flashback scenes served no purpose to the plot and were ultimately bizarre, and not in a good way. Lastely, the ""villains"" did not seem like villains. I am all for deep characters, but these characters weren't deep and they experienced no real change throughout the film, they were more or less Heros with weird outfits who seemed pretty fragile or good from the start which made this way to much like a traditional hero movie. Now that I've covered the terrible script and plot I have to point out the fact that this should have been an R rated film. Suicide Squad was extremely restricted because of its rating which ultimately hurt the story, it's action sequences, its dialogue, and it's characters overall darkness. I'm not saying I want Rambo 4 like violence and wolf of wall street like sex, language, and drug use, but the movie could have been better if it carried a more adult tone to coincide with the already dark and creepy scenery and characters (I mean who enjoys restricted dialogue and bloodless violence and or off screen deaths) The concept of the movie is great and Leto, Smith, and Robbie all did an above average job portraying their characters respectively which makes it all the more sad to see the final product this way. I would love to see a reboot (I know it's not gonna happen lol) but I feel if executed properly this movie could be outstanding, a cast change is not even needed because the acting was solid, the script just ruined it. I hope to see a suicide squad that fans deserve in the near future but in the mean time I'm gonna go watch the Dark Knight to wash my eyes out from the awful film I just paid to see. PS: Christain Bale is batman, sorry Ben Affleck...",Suicide Squad
2281,vamporace,Good fighting scenes won't make up for bad story,4,12 August 2016,"I was utterly disappointed by this movie. Story: I could totally picture the script-writer seeking for a good reason for bad guys to save the world > didn't find any > and just went: ""Ok, what if they say 'let's save the world' (not a spoiler) despite being completely OFF CHARACTER? I think the public won't care"".And the worst ""WTF"" part, for me, was when El Diablo said ""they are my family""... (I'm not telling when or why he said that). Again, the script-writer was probably short on ideas and went for the most improbable action, thinking ""the public won't care..."", again...BUT I DO CARE...---------- Spoiler ON ---------- Same for the 'persuasion scene' where authorities just had ONE demo from the MOST POWERFUL of the ""villains"", and then just went ""Ok, you can build your team""... dude, really? one demo is all it takes? knowing the others are not as good? You sure trust the script- writer, I mean... Amanda.And what about the almighty boss who mysteriously sucks when facing them... so infuriating.---------- Spoiler OFF ----------The humor: Good sometimes, but forced on us other times. Trying to look cool like Deadpool or Guardians of the Galaxy maybe?...The characters: Harley makes sense, the rest is still searching who they really are I guess? Bad or good? I personally think it should be the case. And the JOKER... is a joke. I couldn't find the ""intelligence"" I loved in him in previous movies/comics/animations. He was just crazy... and vapid.Conclusion: To me, the story is empty and has to many ""shortcuts"". It doesn't hold at all. The characters are undefined/unfinished. The action scenes are great, although unrealistic sometimes even for meta-humans. But not enough to reach the 5/10 note for me.In the end, I almost left the theater twice and the action scenes were the only things that made me stay. The last time this happened to me, was for Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003)...PS: I'm not judging the work or the opinions of other spectators, THIS IS ONLY MY PERSONAL OPINION/FEELING.",Suicide Squad
2282,californiawishh,Very happy with the movie overall :),10,12 August 2016,The movie was great only thing it's true that Jared Leto wasn't as good as you'd want him to be but there's several reasons why. He's not a great actor to begin with also he's not ledger. Margot Robbie was AmazinG I feel that she's soon to become very iconic I loved the look they gave her I'm pretty obsessed actually also even Cara Delenvigne was good and creepy as the enchantress While I've never cared too much for marvel movies except for Spider-Man's I see why many people wouldn't like DC because you'll either hate or love this film Can't wait to see all the rest of the movies they have planned In conclusion yes this movie is WeLL worth your $10 go see it. I've already seen it 3 times,Suicide Squad
2283,eviljas,Thank Squad the DCEU could be saved after all!!!!,9,14 August 2016,"I'm not sure Rotten Tomatoes' critics watched the same movie I did. I've seen it twice now, the first time, I really, really liked it, the second, I fell in love. To quote New Kids on the Block ""First time was a great time, second time was a blast."" The biggest difference in my first view and second view was Joker. I am a HUGE Ledger fan, and while I tried not to, I judged Leto by Ledger and that was my mistake. This movie was fun, funny, had heart and most importantly, entertaining. Did it have pacing issues, yes, but note Marvel took five movies to introduce The Avengers, this one takes 30-45 minutes to introduce the Squad. Will Smith, in my opinion, has never been better. Margot Robbie was perfect. Viola Davis was amazing. Contrary to some reviews, you do care for these characters. Batman is used sparingly. We get our first good look at Flash. Leto's Joker isn't in the film as much as the trailers would like you to believe, and that helps. If he were in it too much, his story would have taken away from the Squad's mission. The third act follows the formula used in the majority of comic book movies, destroying a non-human while trying to reach the bigger of the bads. See Avengers or Age of Ultron for prime examples. Several times during this film I applauded and laughed, I was also moved to near tears. It is a fantastic summer movie. Eat your popcorn, sip on your drink and enjoy the ride.",Suicide Squad
2284,riskygirl_gm,Awesome ride with an excellent cast....must see!,10,12 August 2016,"After seeing the reviews that were given on this movie, I needed to make sure that I also got mine in. I am a massive Marvel & DC comic book fan myself. I went into this movie with an open mind. Heath Ledger played an incredible Joker. I wasn't sure if Jared Leto was going to be able to pull off the job but he nailed it! I thought he was spectacular, pure genius performance. Now for the rest of the crew, holy smokes. Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) was sexy, fascinating and bad ass! Will Smith (Dead Shot) did the character well. He was the right guy for the part. I can't say enough about the cast for this movie, just a job well done. I can easily say that easily took the first place spot on my favorite movie list. It was OUTSTANDING...GO SEE IT!",Suicide Squad
2285,toysthebigboys,Good Movie,10,12 August 2016,"This Movie just hyped me for whatever next is coming from DC. I've always thought superhero movies were insanely overrated. To be honest the only reason I saw this was because I was bored on a Sunday afternoon. I'm sure as hell glad I saw this. It turns out I was entirely wrong about this franchise... I love it. I had absolutely no idea what was going on at some parts, but that was probably simply because I have barely seen any of the preceding movies. After seeing this I definitely will. To anyone else who thinks DC is overrated, trust me, give this a shot. You will not be disappointed. I cannot wait for the next movie and the ending (won't spoil it) really sets it up for a sequel. Once again even if superhero movies aren't your thing, I seriously recommend this movie.",Suicide Squad

Expect to be entertained.Will Smith is excellent and actually does real acting in this movie.I enjoyed this movie more than the Star Trek and much more than Ghostbusters. Read article on this movie saying that this movie has the biggest disparity between professional reviewers and audience reviews. I'm sure the professional reviewers were bothered by too many similarities with other super hero films but it worked for me.Perhaps professional reviewers were disappointed with many opportunities the film missed for better character development, but if one just accepts that this is going to be a cotton candy type experience, you will have fun.",Suicide Squad

Really cool original style, not at all what I was expecting. Was not expecting Will Smith to do so well. Also, has a heart...not overly dark and depressing, kinda hopeful actually. Saw this movie 4 times. Strong Judeo-Christian themes. Interesting dynamic of who is actually ""bad"", ""evil"", and ""crazy"". Shows people as deep and complex, with both ""good"" and ""bad"" motivations. Enjoyed it the most on the 2nd and 4th viewing. Didn't love the villain at first, and later felt it made sense and multiple levels.",Suicide Squad
2288,nickster-60308,Not as bad as everyone says,6,13 August 2016,"I want to begin by saying that this is definitely not a perfect movie. I did enjoy it, but there were still many problems with it. The biggest being the messiness of the first act. I felt that there were so many ways to introduce the characters that would've been better than the way they chose. As a result of this, characters like Kiler Croc, Captain Boomerang and Slipknot felt like nothing more than bodies taking up space. Also, some of the exposition (especially for Harley Quinn) was not as deep as it should have been. I was left wanting to see more about her relationship with the Joker, as well as Deadshot's previous life. The entire plot line of the Suicide Squad defeating a CGI witch was rather silly as well. However, once the second act started and the movie went into full swing, I found myself enjoying it. Will Smith and Margot Robbie came through with excellent performances. The action sequences were good for the most part and there was a good amount of humor that was enjoyable as well.

2289,stavrilfan,"Good film, what's all the negativity about?",9,14 August 2016,"Suicide squad was a very highly anticipated film which is good but also bad for any film because there will be people who can't appreciate the amazing acting and skillful writing and work that has been put in to make this film much like the comics in my opinion yes the story-line wasn't amazing but it was different not the same old good guy gets bad guy i also agree with the argument that slipknot was a unless character but they needed a character who people wouldn't get attached too to show how the villains may die and how ruthless the cooperation they were in it. I thought the jokers character was amazing and very well connected to the comics of him and Robbie was amazing as Harley Quinn, every character had their own purpose and it all came together to make a brilliant atmosphere in the film, good job to everyone who helped make this film what it is.",Suicide Squad
2290,nava-35488,Very disappointed,3,14 August 2016,"The only thing that I was really disappointed in, was the fact that the trailer was a false advertisement. The trailer showed so many joker scenes and the movie barely had any. Aside from not having enough Joker scenes the movie was pretty good, but would have been so much better with what we all thought we would get, more Joker. He is my favorite character and I was hoping to see so much more, but that is not what they gave us. I just think that it is unfair for Jared Leto himself and the fans. They shouldn't have cut so many of his scenes. He was definitely the best part of the movie and the only reason why I even watched it, and I know plenty of other people who feel the same way.",Suicide Squad
2291,iracemichael-99655,My third favorite movie of all time,10,14 August 2016,"Where do I begin. This movie is definitely worth the ticket price I'll tell you that. I really didn't expect much from this movie. Why? Because every movie I've seen this year has almost every movie I've seen this year have been forgettable. I've seen them with my friends, and then the next day I would completely forget about it. That's exactly what I thought this movie was gonna be like. Was I wrong? Insanely wrong. This is my third favorite movie of all time. And I don't go around saying that to every movie. With pulp fiction as my first, and a clockwork orange as my second, you can see I'm a kid with very select tastes. This easily made my top 3. How? Because this is the best movie I've seen within the past few years. How did it get there? I'll say it in 3 points. 1. This had the best soundtrack in a movie... EVER... They did the perfect blend of new, old, pump up, slow, rock, pop, and rap songs like no other movie has done before. I added more than half of these songs to my basketball playlist. 2. Margot Robbie stole the show... Ever since I saw her in wolf of Wall Street, I knew she was going somewhere. Her perfect mix of sexiness, and commitment to the roll made her completely steel the show. 3. Jarod Leto is the best on film joker... I know that I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this but to me, he is the best joker ever. He struck me as a new, hip, clean cut, well groomed, rich, gangster joker that the comics knew. I highly recommend this movie. It's amazing. Please go see it, for it gets my 10/10. Thanks for reading.",Suicide Squad
2292,kdabi,"Great cast , mediocre plot and awesome dialogues",8,14 August 2016,"Despite being one of the most anticipated movie of the year, David Ayer's Suicide Squad was unable to fulfill the expectations of the audience. It is important to notice that while all the usual elements of a superhero flick are present, this is a somewhat different kind of a superhero film. It consists of the villains we love from DC Universe, doing atrocious things all in the name of good. In the first half of the movie it looks quite promising but in second half storytelling becomes slow and it starts loosing connection with the audience.Oscar nominee actor Will Smith leads the squad and fully justifies the character of the unerring assassin, Deadshot. Margot Robbie is terrific as the giggly devious maniac Harley Quinn, earning the movie's best lines and nailing almost every one of them. The movie has a little feminist tone as all female characters are shown strong, confident and given kick-ass lines, thus breaking the usual stereotypes about women. The Oscar winning actor Jared Leto's Joker has less than 10 minutes of screen time. Though Jared Leto brought a new perspective to the Joker, his performance couldn't reach the bar set by Heath Ledger's legendary Joker in DC's Dark Knight.In my opinion, the best kind of visual effects are the ones where we can't separate effects from reality and Suicide Squad gets full marks in this department. The fighting scenes were amazingly shot, the camera angles of each stunt were stunning and chosen very appropriately. Amazing work was done in Cinematography and some scenes were so exquisitely shot that it gave me Goosebumps, like the scene of Enchantress taking control over Dr June Moon.Overall the dialogues and fight scenes were great while the plot was quite weak. Still the story was saved by the awesome performance delivered by Margot Robbie and Will Smith .If you don't like Action and Superhero movies then this is definitely not for you. For all the DC comic lovers this exciting entertainer is a must watch.",Suicide Squad

I was very much excited to see Will smith as Dead shot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn,but in-spite of its big cast's, the movie seems to be boring and less entertaining. It was hard for me to stay focused till the end. If the screenplay and story could be much more in depth then the movie would had been a better bet. The BGM seems to be not with the movie. We audience and fans come for a DC movie to see action and some cool stuffs like gadgets, armors and lot of action, looks like the director got everything wrong here.

If there would be a part 2 of this movie, i would recommend the director to focus more on the joker and Harley give them the main role and let the movie be psychotic and funny without the interference of the batman! its time to see villains win at the end!! would be an epic twist!",Suicide Squad

A good selection of great tracks played loud got the skin tingling. Visually it was stunning, great use of colour, very stylish. A lot of what the critics say is true but despite this it works if you don't take it to seriously and deliberately don't look for the flaws. Good to see a new take on the joker and loved the linkage in the story line to other super heroes . Having two very strong females one on either side of the good/evil albeit blurred divide really made if for me. With so many characters it could only give the back story properly for a few. It did leave me wanting more in this respect but a hard balance to get right. Worth ignoring the reviews and taking a punt but go with an open mind",Suicide Squad
2297,adamvyfhuis,"After seeing Suicide Squad this past weekend, I was left disgruntled by the awful choices Warner Brother Studios has made this year with their expansion of the DCEU.",4,15 August 2016,"After seeing Suicide Squad this past weekend, I was left disgruntled by the awful choices Warner Brother Studios has made this year with their expansion of the DCEU. Though they handled some things well, like the casting of Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley, director David Ayer and accomplices at WB studios failed to make a completely coherent film yet again. I'll start with the negative first and there is a lot of it, reader beware.My biggest issue with the film was its tonal inconsistencies, in one moment you're in a gritty side street being ambushed by Batman, and in the next you're watching a quirky montage of our anti-heroes suiting up for battle to Eminem's ""Without me"" - what's worse is that this type of scene/cuts happen consistently throughout the film and it just takes you out of the moment. My second issue with the film is what I call the ""Army Aspect"". The villain gathers an army to distract the protagonists of the film, while he/she does something evil and maleficent behind the scenes. My problem is that we've seen it done already! Not once, but twice with both Avengers films. How many more times must we watch a group of ""heroes"" fight an army of foreign species? Whats even worse is when they finally defeat the ""Army"" and confront the main villain of the movie - Enchantress - she is just standing there babbling nonsense and doing weird twitching movements. Frankly she looks like she is about to have a very serious stroke. They then proceed to have this long drawn out fight sequence, which ends up being useless because she just decides to disarm them, it's really jarring to actually watch happen. The movie is a mess in a lot of places.The movie seems to have been severely tampered with the studio because there are just some disgusting and rudimentary cuts throughout the film. There are scenes that were obviously docked from the film, parts that would have more than likely made the film better a la Batman V. Superman: Ultimate Edition. For the life of me, I cannot understand what goes on over at Warner Brother Studios that makes them want to produce garbage film when they have the resources to make them complete and coherent. I wait anxiously for Wonder Woman, hoping that WB studios have learnt from their last two flops.Though I made the movie seem like a steaming bag of dump, it wasn't all bad. There were small glimmers of hope, specifically with Jared Leto's portrayal of The Joker. Though he is no Heath Ledger, who is arguably the best Joker, Leto's portrayal was unique and fresh. I personally did not like the fact that he was a gang banger mob boss type, but I feel as though if it was expanded upon and explained in some detail it might be an easier pill to swallow. I also feel like Margot Robbie gave a great performance as Harley Quinn even though her character wasn't written particularly well. Her on screen chemistry with Jared Leto was also great. Will Smith, as well as the writers, did an excellent job with Deadshot giving him character depth and making him relatable. My last qualm with the film is lack of character explanation for Killer Croc and Captain Boomerang, they just felt divisive and shoe horned into the movie.The movie could be better, a lot better and a huge piece of me wants the DCEU movies to be great. I hope that directors and Warner Bros Studio learns from their past DCEU filmography and drastically improves it. I wait anxiously for Wonder Woman later next year as well as the proposed Ben Affleck directed Batman movie.",Suicide Squad

I heard some bad reviews about it but because I am a DC nation fan I had to see for myself! I loved the characters! I mostly loved watching scenes with Harley and the joker! they really put me in my feelings! Not to mention the soundtrack is great and really upbeat. I recommended you watch this movie and don't listen to the negative reviews! The only thing I would want was more joker and Harley scenes but I heard a new movie might be made about them! I also recommend that you think about this movie as separate from the comics. Of course it stays true to the comics but some aspect involving the characters are different.

Nothing was ever supposed to be cut, and being there some flashbacks actually seems cool so that for those watchers who don't know anything about the character can understand what that character is going through.Maybe it would have been better if Jared's parts were also shown. I think this movie was honestly great, funny, action packed and had the best story line ever! And I should know about story lines, I'm a writer after all.Don't get mad for what you can't see and let others enjoy what you couldn't.Who knows maybe sometime soon there could even be a movie plotting the story line of Harley Quinn and the Joker, which would be a fun idea of what they've been going through.This movie was indeed good, I just don't see how anyone can make a bad statement on a great movie.",Suicide Squad
2302,oaki_oac,"Not only one of my favorite superhero movies, one of my favorite films ever",6,6 September 2016,"I started a while ago a list of my favorite superhero films and this movie is on the 3rd place for now. People generally think that a film is all about action, humor and again, action. This superhero film is not only about that: it's also about family (Deadshot, El Diablo), about romance (Harley Quinn and The Joker, June Moone and Rick Flagg) and about accepting who you truly are (El Diablo, June and even Deadshot). In short, it's got a lot of character development for the majority of characters (those mentioned above + Katana -afterall she wanted to revenge her husband and without her sword at the end, the Suicide Squad couldn't defeat Enchantress- and Amanda Waller, even if it may not seem like that; she used the 'bad guys' to save herself but still, she doesn't give them much freedom even they did something good, sacrificed themselves (El Diablo) and found something good in all of them). However, I admit that Captain Boomerang and Croc could have been used more if WB would have spent more money for at least 15 minutes more. When watching a film (doesn't matter what genre in most cases) I usually look for a message and a very strong plot. I found both here; even the bad guys can do some good for the world, but they are still watched negatively by the public even so, they all have backstories and families and they sometimes suffer for what they do. Speaking about the plot, I didn't find any plot holes in this movie. And it's not a mess; if it is, then what's The Avengers? The things that make SS better than the 'blockbuster' mentioned above is that it's a got a message, character development, more seriousness (this thing meaning that SS is way more realistic not only compared to The Avengers, but superhero films in general) and that there aren't aliens wanting to conquer the Earth, theme approached from the '90 or even earlier I guess, which shows how imaginative and original the story is.Overall, I don't see why people don't like or even hate the new DC movies. They've got a more real conflict, character development way more than Marvel films (not including the X-Men here), a message fueled by emotion and backstories of characters. You don't really see that in Marvel movies in my opinion. I guess I expressed my point of view already. I hope that fans will start to look more positively at DC films and see the hidden purpose and message of them. I'm not saying that there are none of these things in some of the Marvel films, like The Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron (though the whole movie is a plot hole for me), Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor and Civil War (however, this one has some plot holes). But the DC movies are more realistic, not too overstuffed and simply better for me. I hope you enjoyed the review as it is my first one on IMDb and my first one ever. If you want and have some time as well, please take a look at the lists I made, one of which is with superhero films. Have a nice day! P.S. If Interstellar is 10/10, then this film is 7/10. I'm not comparing films with the ones similar in genre necessarily, but with my favorite one.",Suicide Squad
2303,wboote,A wasted opportunity that ends up as a damp squib.......,3,18 August 2016,"Any pre-showing excitement we had built up at being entertained by a fast paced, visually outstanding or witty film dissipated within the first half hour. Recent superhero or comic book based films have offered so much more. From the sharp, dark, deadpan humour of Deadpool or even the all round family appeal of Guardians of the Galaxy. Instead here we have a confused plot, painting by numbers editing and flat bland dialogue that amounts to a tedious mess. What a wasted opportunity from such good potential?The editing was bizarre and disjointed. Some opening scenes were lengthy, introducing a few main characters in detail and then the remaining characters were dropped in, almost as extras. As if they ran out of time because they didn't plan the structure of the film properly.It felt like entire scenes were cut when we jumped from the Enchantress being contained to suddenly releasing her brother. No explanation or reason as to how or why this chain of events could suddenly happen. The scriptwriters use the Enchantress and her brother as a Hitchcockian McGuffin. They simply become a plot device to enable the Suicide Squad to bond together to fight them. But without any narrative explanation, the viewer is left being unable to identify with any of the characters and has no one to will on to win the fight. Therefore the film lacked any tension. The only worthwhile elements in the entire film are the superb costumes and the casting for Harley Quinn and the Joker. Without the pair I would have walked out before the end so bored was I with the dull way the film plodded along. Jared Leto and Margot Robbie have found their niche. However it is disappointing that neither were given any amusing dialogue and no effort was made to use their anarchic characters to develop the plot. Once again we were treated to the true misogyny of the Hollywood film industry. The sexy and fearless Harley Quinn came to existence as a result of her crazed passion for the Joker. An already dysfunctional character prior to meeting the Joker she then has her true self unleashed upon meeting of her soul mate( Bonne and Clyde style ). It's a tortured love affair that's complex and brutal. Yet in this version she is shown as a respectable character corrupted by a love spell cast by the Joker. He is then shown to create her madness with electric shock therapy . The violent and insane nature of the male characters isn't offered a similar treatment. They are accepted for their violence and anarchic streaks and their life choices. Why is it so hard for Hollywood and male film directors to show a woman being naturally dangerous or driven insane with desires? Then we follow up later in the film with a scene that showed Harley Quinn's true desire to be wanting to conform and have the picket fence suburban family. This is a complete betrayal of the original character. As if we can only offer redemption and embrace her madness because deep down she just wants to be married and have a baby. Did we drop back into the fifties here? The film continues its treatment of woman as only bad ass characters because of the influence of men. Katana is a top class martial arts killer but only because she is redeeming the death of her husband. It is shown that a female can only be in a position of authority if she is as cold and brutal as any killer. I can't recall many male protagonists in charge of similar teams in other films shooting their own staff for no genuine reason other than sheer ruthlessness. Tired and clichéd sexist nonsense.The plot was formulaic and then became confused and jumped about all over the place. The Enchantress's army looked like extras with bad acne straight from a 1950's b movie and not the least bit scary. And as for the climatic ending, had someone just watched the original Ghostbusters and thought ' ""Hey that's a great plot line""? I don't know which is more depressing the thought that this is the type of film a modern day audience expects to view or the fact that executives think this is the type of film that we should be viewing. Doesn't hold much hope for a brighter film industry. Less suicide squad and more damp squib.",Suicide Squad
2304,maditomalia,Awesome! Plot is lacking though.,9,19 August 2016,"Not sure why people hate this, maybe the bandwagon effect? But I know my friends and I loved it and so did my BF (saw it twice) but I do agree the plot was lacking and they could of used more joker scenes because I'm a long time fan of Jared Leto and his arts especially his music, which by the way he did fantastic as the joker! All fan-girl comments aside I still think the movie deserves a better rating due to the casting, art, acting, action, and even the effects and character development throughout the film. OK, to fill the minimum I noticed a few ""Goofs"" during the last quarter of the film that where small but still fun to see on the big screen, not sure if that counts as a spoiler but it involves the way a phone is being held. I might just end up marking this as spoiler just in case.",Suicide Squad
2305,giogimic,"In short this movie is a great mix of Comedy, Story and Action.",10,19 August 2016,"In short this movie is a great mix of Comedy, Story and Action. Way better then almost every related release in the past i'd say 5 years. These 3 characters really take the movie to the next level. Will Smiths character Deadshot is played off really well and his relationship with the entire squad is pretty fun to watch but watching his interactions with Margot Robbie aka Harley Quinn are some of the best moments in the movie. Margot Robbie's character Harley Quinn must be if not the best the second best character within the show her and Will Smith play their roles excellently and their interactions with each other and the other members of the squad are fun to watch. One of the best parts of Harley Quinn in the movie is that she doesn't just full on drop her relationship with The Joker to be come the Bad Guy-Hero. Also seeing how Jared Leto aka The Joker twisted Harley Quinn in to his puppet was something nice to see on screen. Jay Hernandez aka Diablo.. Man this character is amazing and really brings the squad together in end. Without spoiling anything i just got to say this character along with Will Smith and Margot Robbie are the 3 characters that take this movie from a 6 and bring it to a 10 for me.",Suicide Squad
2306,mariebrc,It's way better than what you heard,9,20 August 2016,"When I saw all the bad reviews online, I was afraid I would be disappointed by the movie, but I had a pleasant surprise: none of the bad reviews were accurate, at least from my point of view. I found the movie quite different from the other DC films, and in a good way. They tried something new and nailed it. The beginning may let you think it was going to be messy, but not at all. Margot Robbie was amazing as Harley Quinn. The interpretation of the joker, though it was slightly different from the comics, was aced by Jared Leto. No characters were the same and all had depth, which was something I really liked. And of course, the plot was great. It's mostly an action movie though, so don't go there expecting a lot of side stuff, for example don't think that the relationship between the characters will be extremely developed, for it isn't the theme of the movie. My advice is not to take the bad reviews under consideration and watch Suicide Squad so as to build your own opinion, whatever it may be :) Hopefully we'll get to see Task Force X in future films.",Suicide Squad
2307,newcandycane,I expected more.,3,20 August 2016,I really expected more from this movie. I won't spoil anything about the plot. But from the trailer everything has been pretty much about Harley Quinn and the Joker.. BUT the Joker has like no screen time. And what happened to all the jokes they were putting in after seeing Deadpool being such a success.. Lame and boring jokes that made me and the people I went with cringe big time. I won't go lower as 4 as the the rest of the movie was alright. I need to fill out this review with a lot of nonsense because I can't think of anything else to put in to this review. I guess I can talk how the trailer made this movie a masterpiece to what it really is. but Jesus... I want my money back.,Suicide Squad
2308,jamitaf,This story pretty much is the gathering of villains in order to fight a bigger villain. It goes into a bit of each villain's origin story.,8,20 August 2016,"As a DC fan I liked the movie. I've read the Suicide Squad comics and it pretty much follows the same story line for gathering villains to combat other villains. I like origin stories and getting to know characters so I appreciated that they did this. There is enough action in the movie as well as a bit of romance (between the Joker and Harley). Although, they did downplay the abusiveness of the Joker (probably to appease Joker and Harley shippers). I think Enchantress is a good female villain. It's the usual bad guy wants to destroy the world theme, but that's just to be expected. The soundtrack made the movie, there's a lot of good songs in the movie.",Suicide Squad
2309,artjedi,Suicide Squad is a colorful yet a drab movie,3,21 August 2016,"Came out of Suicide Squad thinking it was a fun movie, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized it wasn't fun, but just an extremely poorly made movie. The villain was terrible. I liked her in feral witch mode because she was actually kind of frightening. But once she became Aztacian, was confusing and awfully executed. Cara does a good job with what she is given initially, but the snake like dancing make no sense with what her character is. She seemed like a Shaman wolf in her first ""form"", almost demonic, but once she is transformed yet again, turns into a seductive Sucubuss, or a snake. Enchantress/Dr. June Moone was already a doctor who turned into an other worldly witch, she didn't need to be a doctor who turned into an other worldly witch who turned into a sexy and even more powerful other worldly witch. It was counter-productive; it goes against what was already established as her character – as someone who turns into an even more powerful someone. Having her become more powerful by her brother defeats the purpose of having Enchantress being the main villain. He in-fact is the object of her power, and creates nocebo effect in which he is actually is more powerful than Enchantress. The Suicide Squad being more afraid of her brother and not her is a negative idea, as it makes Enchantress the lesser of the two. SHE'S THE VILLAIN, THEY SHOULD BE AFRAID OF HER! She was also terrible because of unclear motivations, and strange and out of character choices like: why did she resort to a sword fight for the final battle when she had incredible magical abilities? Why did she leave her heart in the cave after she realized Waller knew about her or even allowed ARGUS to get ahold of her heart? Why did she have to create a weapon when both her and her brother were gods with the same amount of power as the weapon? Why did she allow Harley Quinn to get in arms reach of a sword when she knew Harley was mentally unstable and was lying about siding with her, she did have telepathic abilities after-all? Viola Davis is a strong actress and is good in the role of Amanda Waller, but had a weak excuse for bringing the Squad together. Her excuse is that there aren't any heroes remaining to take down the next bad Superman, even though we already have Flash, Wonder Woman, and Batman being heroes in this Universe. She's wanting a team of Meta humans, but the only meta human's she recruits are El Diablo and Enchantress. El Diablo refuses to use his powers and Enchantress doesn't even become a member of the Squad. There are major plot holes like: Captain Boomerang is leaving the Squad and is leaving town when the Squad is at the bar, but is in the very next scene standing beside them. He never came back, and he was farther away than the rest of the members. How did Joker survive when he didn't jump out of the helicopter and the nuke hit the back where he was seemingly at? He would've died first come think of it. Then again, Harley was in the helicopter too, how did she survive the initial nuke. I understand she was pushed, but the nuke was aimed right at the Joker and Harley. There were among other plot holes that had ruined the movie.El Diablo is one of the strongest characters, with one of the most effective stories. His backstory highly effects his current actions and is a more positive influence than other characters. The redemption arc presented in this film works well with the overall plot of the film, but does however, get saturated by a simple yet ineffective script. Highlights like this, and the interactions between Harley Quinn and Joker create a veil that elevates the quality of the film. Harley Quinn, another highlight of this movie, is a fun and colorful role that allows Margot Robbie shine in a bland script. At times, jokes and innuendoes seemed forced, but Margot works through these problems and allows her acting to overpower these lines. The Joker on the other hand, has a rougher time overcoming these obstacles, as Jared Leto is often times seen struggling to out power the bad script, but this is more due to David Ayer directing Leto to be more like a psychotic version of Al Capone, when the character was written more like a comic book accurate Joker. A notable scene that shows the contradicting styles is when the Joker is in the middle of the weapons circle telling Frost to find Harley in a menacing glare, then suddenly leans back and creepily laughs. The other problem with Joker is having to few things to do in the film, which leaves a much less desired Joker. With these problems in mind, I look forward to see Joker in future films, and to see how Jared will do under the direction of a more seasoned Ben Affleck.The music was also very jarring, because they blasted the ""greatest hits"" and drowned out the actors. Editing suffered from the same issues that Batman v Superman endured, quick scenes that would either move too quickly, or jump from one scene to another than back again. It was at times either confusing or disrupted the flow that the scene had already established. Most notable of these was during the final boss fight, in which the editing completely damaged the suspense establishing Harley's motives. Only redeeming thing about the film were the characters, the actors which were just amazing, and setting up the future of the DC Extended Universe!",Suicide Squad
2310,amadourbaptiste,My opinion,8,21 August 2016,"I am greatly impressed by this movie it was great although some deleted scenes were a bit of a disappointment. It seemed Margot Robbie didn't like her costume but it did make the character look that perfect for the joker, the combination of the film was amazing but for the funding the movie was a bit of a waste. The story line was short and had lesser meaning, and most of it wasn't as nice as the comics. Although this movie had great actors and i enjoyed it, it could use a couple of improvements and add back some of those deleted scenes. Altogether i would give this film 8/10 stars This was a great film to watch with a older audience of maybe pg 13+ and the story line could have been improved compared to the budget spent on the movie. I believe the reviews of this film are wrong and misleading compared tot he effort and great story that has been put into work.",Suicide Squad
2311,candelaman,Biggest Misfire Ever,2,13 December 2016,"Honestly, the biggest problem with this crap of a movie is the main concept: the point of Suicide Squad isn't to combat superheros like Superman, which is so dumb btw. The main point of Suicide Squad was that the team would go on shady black ops missions for the government, so that the government couldn't get in trouble in case the mission goes wrong. The concept is quite genius, actually: if the team gets caught, the government then promptly blames the mission on the team members, who happen to be prominent criminals; if the team is killed, good for society, less criminals in the world; if the team is successful, then the government gains what they need without any problems. And the insurance in case one of the team members goes AWOL: an explosive implanted in their head blows up, killing that person. In return for success, the criminals' prison time is lowered.You would think that after the success of recent unconventional blockbusters like Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and Deadpool, that Warner Bros would see that audiences tend to embrace fresh and original and weird movies, and that they'd give creative freedom to this movie, and allow it to fully blossom (even if the original premise is still fundamentally flawed). But unfortunately, due to the ""mixed"" reception that Batman v Superman got, Warner Bros. had to make sure that this film wasn't bad, or else they wouldn't get that billion dollar movie they want so badly. And it clearly shows in the finished product how badly they messed up.So besides the already fundamentally broken story, the cinematography is also pretty bad. Like, it's not poor quality bad, but more like there-is-a-room-on-fire-and-it's-still-dark-as-hell bad. The editing is also laughably bad, with so many bad cuts I just can't. The costumes are pretty stupid (like why would you put the eye-thingy on the side of his eye that he doesn't rely on shooting? Also, that volleyball mask is so funny). I would say the makeup is one of the extremely rare upsides this movie has, because of alligator man, but then again, the Joker's tattoos are sooooo dumb, but honestly, that's on the part of the director. The performances in this movie are also pretty damn poor. Harley Quinn basically had no character in the movie other than to be the ""strong and free-spirited female character in the movie that feminists can fall in love with"". Except she doesn't really do anything empowering other than some laughably bad action scenes that don't make any sense at all. I will say though Margot Robbie was at least tolerable, and that it probably wasn't her fault that her character was a piece of crap (Though she shouldn't be getting the praise everyone is giving her). Will Smith was Will Smith, Jai Courtney was actually good (relatively), and everyone else was just unforgettable. Except Jared Leto, who, despite all odds, manages to become the worst joker ever. Like, this isn't even the director's fault or the studio's fault, this is just really bad and stupid acting.Now, one of the biggest problems with the film, which is part of the broken story criticism, is the lack of any characterization or clear understanding of these characters. Instead of taking a risk with these flawed and complex characters, and giving them a satisfying and original arc, Warner Bros. dumbs down these characters and makes them clichéd, forgettable stereotypes (the overpowered guy who won't fight, the silent and pragmatic Japanese lady, the soldier who's ultra serious and snarky, Will Smith, etc). What's even worse, they thought it'd be a bright idea to give someone maybe a tiny bit of character development, and have Jai Courtney have a fetish for pink unicorns. That is so laughably dumb and lazy, I have no idea how these people get jobs at Hollywood. I mean, how bout you make this Boomerang guy a man struggling with his own unimportance, and like maybe give him a huge ego, so that throughout the movie, he'll grow into a man who starts caring about others. Or not, and have his character be a tragic one, who's ego ultimately leads to his downfall and death. But alas, this is Dc we're talking about here, and apparently they don't know jack about telling a story. And what really grinds my gears is how it's so obvious that Warner Bros. cut out the famous abusive relationship of Joker and Harley. Honestly, it would've made Harley an even stronger character, a woman trying to get free of a relationship that clearly isn't healthy. It would also add a hell of a lot of depth that's clearly missing in the movie. But, Warner Bros. again messed up. They also completely misfired on the character of the Joker. The Joker isn't some gangster who does random stuff and laughs about it, and loves Harley Quinn; the Joker is a scary character that takes pleasure in toying with people, and sees the whole world as a trivial place, making fun of the amount of work people put into trying to make sense of everything. But for some reason, Warner Bros. and David Ayer decide that this new incarnation should be a gangster, cause that's original, duhhhhh (it's also stupid). The Joker also doesn't love anyone besides probably Batman, and that's more of a fascination. The Joker's obsession with Batman is due to the situation: if Batman kills him, the Joker wins, if Batman doesn't kill him, then Joker can keep messing with him. It's a win-win. The Joker plays around with Harley, and abuses her too, but never ever does he even remotely like her. But Warner Bros., again, messes up badly.Overall, this movie is crap, the effort put into it was crap, and it makes me wanna throw up. Wtf, Warner Bros.? You had one job",Suicide Squad
2312,warleyzee,Esquadrão Suicida,5,22 August 2016,"CRITICAL-SUICIDE SQUAD NO SPOILER The film starts from the point where Batman Vs Superman ends. Villains They are recruited fearing an alleged threat of ""evil Superman"" or similar alien force, an ambitious plan Amanda Waller (Viola Davis). The chosen are Gunslinger (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Crocodile (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Magic (Cara Delevingne) .Juntos they form the Suicide Squad. With remakes made a few months before the release of the film, some cuts and narratives were embarrassing and confused. This is very clear we first minutes of film. The direction the script is on account of David Ayer. He wanted to do a feature on a team, but just focusing and giving more importance to Margot Robbie and Will Smith, after all are the best known and experienced in big screen. Having all this space Margot Robbie did not disappoint, beautiful dangerous and troubled, he stole the scenes he appeared, starring some of the best moments. Will Smith knowing choose his papers did not leave to be desired as the gunman, character It sold very well for him, with the best long action scenes. Beyond these two character another character that was exploited was the Diablo, the remaining balance and miss time, the impression now is they were there just to complete the team. Joker ... Joker is a of the greatest villains of comics, being played by Jared Leto, left much to be desired, it is only an infantile version of Crazy Heath Ledger (Christopher Nolan Joker). Joker is sociopath, selfish, crazy not care about anyone, this film is a spoiled boy. Suicides squad has some of the best trails sonar as with a amazing musical selection as The Animals (The House of the Rising Sun), Severn Nation Army (The White Stripes), Sympathy for the Devil (The Rolling Stones), Paranoid (Black Sabbath), but that does not work, the impression that happens is that we are hearing a great playlist More that does not fit the plot. Is clearly trying to do the same Guardians of the Galaxy on its track. Only it was not well in the attempt, the which is a shame with such good songs. Suicide Squad is fun, Score. Not the best film adapted from comic ta far from being the worst. Could be better, much better but still is already a big step for the DC in theaters, which is learning from mistakes.PERSONAL NOTE: 5/10 DIRECTION: David Ayer DISTRIBUTOR: Warner Bros",Suicide Squad

I was really excited about the movie, the Joker and Harley Quinn are two of my favorite comics characters, I thought the idea of getting a Suicide Squad was really really good and could lead to a lot of craziness, funny scenes,...I cannot explain how Disappointed I am. (Capital D, I need to show it in my review) The movie is definitely one of the worst I've watched in my entire life. I'm probably not objective here because of the feelings I got before I see it. We don't see enough of the Joker, the story is just stupid, Cara Delevingue's character is useless...I could go on and write all the bad things down but I won't, I'm sick of it. I was about to rate 1 out of 10 but Will Smith's performance is good (+1) and an other +1 because of Margot Robbie. My heart is melting every time I see her.P.S.

Their chemistry is electric, funny, and watching them teasing, and slowly started to care about each other, is entertaining, and make me ship them together. even, i have a relationship that had a weak chemistry, that is Rick Flagg and June Moore's relationship which is bland, forced, and unnecessary. Now, parts that i think is the weak part of the movie, I think the plot is the main reason. The plot is lazy-written and under- developed,and at some point is pretty ridiculous. i don't want to get into it too much, since it will spoil some things, and i need you to watch the movie without spoilers, yet. even, i could tell you that the CGI is pretty cringy and sometimes, so does the visual effect between the scenes. the ending is actually rushed, predictable, and i think they could do better after building up the story of the fight scene.",Suicide Squad

I liked the characters, their powers, the jokes and the music. The most DC's characters need a psychiatrist and so they have a really weakness and a problem. The casting was good. I liked Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Will Smith as Deadshot and Jay Hernández as Diablo. It's difficult to write about the Joker because the Joker was very different. But he was million times better as Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. I don't get the negative critics. Perhaps some people have Posttrauma after ""Batman vs. Superman"";-) ""Batman vs. Superman"" was very bad but Suicide Squad is a masterpiece. the movie could been 10 minutes longer to show the stories of the other characters.

2317,stevewendy-23740,Common Senseless -,1,24 August 2016,"Perfect for all the immature adults who require no depth in a movie!Funny how this movie has made nearly a hundred million dollars with so many bad reviews. It really goes to show that Hollywood can use a lot of special effects, introduce a few famous comic book characters, throw in some sexy legs, twisted darkness, and a lot of bad language and people will pay to come see it. I got fooled, but I saw it on opening day so I didn't have much to go by.Now DC has plenty of money to produce another thoughtless and shallow minded movie with no substance, just ridiculous evil attitude because that seems to be what most of the world is being lured into. Now I know to red flag DC movies before allowing enough time for normal people reviews to hit.I can remember an amazing movie from months ago like Lone Survivor as if I saw it yesterday. For some reason I can't remember much from this movie because there isn't much to remember.I guess we got tired of the good guys always winning so now it's trendy to have the bad guys winning, but in the long run, the concept fails miserably every time. Get a clue DC. You can do way better than this with those millions, but then you're making millions and I'm not. So why not cater to millions of shallow minded viewers who won't have the kryptonite nerves of steel to give a mature opinion of what this movie did for them.

The Harley Quinn character was beyond annoying; please somebody shut her up. It was excruciating listening to her every time she opened her mouth. I was so happy during the part when she almost died. Ugh, she was horrible. And it's a shame, because her character was the one I was most looking forward to and the one I was most disappointed with. The whole production was just really cheap and cheesy. Also, I offered to buy my friend a drink afterwards because she had sat through the whole shitty thing. I felt bad. I was embarrassed that I had recommended we go see it. It was a waste of quality friend time, an evening, and 12 dollars and 80 cents.",Suicide Squad

It's sad to see that nearly no effort is being put into the storyline of movies anymore all the money and time is being spent on special effects and famous actors to bring in the profit.The first half of suicide squad was boring introductions which weren't well thought out, none of the characters made an impression. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense and was just terrible. They had a bad as team of villain's and instead of making them evil they turned all of them into nice guys except Harley Quinn even then she didn't do anything crazy. Why not just make them evil and get on with it they tried to make a few of them seem ashamed of their crimes what a waste. the guy with fire superpowers was scared to use them for most of the movie...? I think the movie industry should be ashamed of themselves.. Where has their passion gone for writing a masterpiece and why has the public rolled over and accepted such garbage from people that get majorly overpaid. They get paid to entertain and they are failing at their job, no effort at all :( !",Suicide Squad
2321,diegolopez-41848,A lot of hype but not much,5,28 August 2016,"A movie that doesn't make any sense. In the universe they've created there's not a real need of this squad. Having flash, batman, aqua-man, wonder woman and having all the bad guys in jail which is the need? Another reason that I think it is illogical is because the squad is made to defend the nation from a possible future meta human and i think that the Harley Quinn they've created with a bat and a gun isn't much more useful than a seal or a marine. Even though in the acting part Margot did it perfectly showing us the Harley we all wanted.And if they are gonna beat the evil guy with a bomb wouldn't it be much more intelligent to use a missile since the city is just full of zombies or whatever those monsters are?",Suicide Squad
2322,sirpablonielsen,Disappointing,3,28 August 2016,The whole movie was very disappointing. The first ten minutes were well and good but then as they tried to establish the plot the whole story was destroyed. As all the events unfold after the first half hour I realized that I had absolutely no clue what was happening. The main villain is introduced and when that happens I actually thought she was a part of the square and the actual villain was coming up. But later I'm pleasantly surprised when I realize that I was indeed thrown into a movie that has all of 3 connected plot points and about 17 different back stories still being set up that are all thrown into a movie that should have been double the length to even be able to establish all the characters and set up a cohesive story line and that I am not incredibly stupid.,Suicide Squad
2323,hitmanfma,Worst movie i've ever seen,2,29 August 2016,"Stupid, repetitive (two helicopters crashes, two of them crashed one after another? what the f...?) and lifeless. DC's version of Guardians of the Galaxy (should i mention that the ""You messed with my friends"" line is an almost exact copy of the ""Nobody messes with my friends"" scene from Guardians?) is awful. It sucks, because BvS Ultimate Cut is decent, that's the tone they should've done. It's all just a clusterfuck, i'm sure the movie was better before the reshoots, but guess what? exactly like FOX and Fant4stic, the studio got in the way and made an unwatchable movie that lacks structure and pacing. The third act is the worst thing on earth, as it contains pathetic fight scenes and manipulative ""character moments"", at least BvS, a movie which also has an awful third act, is never boring even at a three hour runtime. Don't watch this movie if you don't want your brain cells to die.",Suicide Squad
2324,megglecuddlebunny,This is awesome!,10,30 August 2016,"I loved every joke, every nuance. I never read the comics, so I had no fan girl-expectations to be crushed.Right at the top of the awesome that is Suicide Squad, there is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, first introduced in Batman: the Animated Series back in the 90's. Sometimes I can still forget that, relatively speaking, Ms. Quinn is the new kid in the Rogue's Gallery (or one of them).Robbie is beautiful, batty and all bad as Harley, bad in the best possible way. Harley is a BAMF and a total boss, perhaps figuring out how she can exist with the Joker. Or learning that she can exist without him.The nuances of pure madness are perfectly portrayed by Robbie, adding new dimensions to the formerly 2D character and rounds them out into a pure and whole 4D image of a woman who lives in world apart from ours, yet can still feel love and devotion and loyalty, can feel sadness and joy, and even make friends.Yes, Harley was who I loved best in this film, it gets a 10 from me just for that.If you want to know more, watch it!",Suicide Squad
2325,rlmalizia,Very Impressive,8,4 September 2016,"Suicide Squad is a movie that many DC fans have been waiting years for. As with any movie that has been so highly anticipated, people had very high expectations for how the movie would turn out. Although the plot was not as developed as it could have been, and it didn't stick right with the comics (although these movies never do, and there's nothing wrong with that), the movie was an incredible success. The casting was phenomenal, proving wrong the uncertainty from many fans about the initial casting of Will Smith as Deadshot and Jared Leto as the Joker. Overall, the movie was incredibly funny and action packed while still being able to tell the story of the suicide squad. Definitely worth seeing.",Suicide Squad
2326,Sky_The_Space_Elf,Over-Hyped Disappointment is an Understatement,3,1 September 2016,"Suicide Squad is the ultimate let-down. For the first time on the big screen, we see some of DC's biggest villains, but completely misrepresented. We have Will Smith, portraying the stone-faced and tough Deadshot, as if he was from a cheap 90's comedy. Harley Quinn, the psychotic yet lovable jester, is morphed into a stuck up and cringe-worthy bimbo. Many of the other ""Squad"" members are so unessential and pointless to include, that their sole purpose must have just been for marketing ploys. For example, in advertisements and merchandise, we see so much of the Joker. The sad reality is, his scenes tally up to a total of 15 minutes on nonconsecutive screen time. The horrible casting decisions, cheap and overused plot (""misfit team needs to save the earth!""), and the sprinkling in of characters that are so unessential and serve no other purpose than to just stand there, are just a few of the elements that make this one bad movie. One would expect so much more from a film that has been so heavily hyped up and marketed to actually have some sense of direction, but instead us comic fans are left with a terrible excuse of a 'Marvel wannabe' flick. Don't waste your money or your time on this sorry excuse of a 'fun film'.",Suicide Squad

Here is a list of the thing wrong with this movie in only the first 30 minutes:-Violence - movie was over violent to a point where it is unbelievable-dark - all of the characters and scenes were dark,creepy,and some a bit sexual.

2329,lukfodder,Excellent movie,10,5 September 2016,"While there are many reviews panning this movie as forced or calling the story line unoriginal and the characters one dimensional, I couldn't disagree more.Having been a fan of all things Batman for...what almost 30 years? Since I was old enough to read and my father bought me my first batman comic, I'd call myself somewhat of an expert on the subject matter. Many critics are calling Leto's interpretation of the joker as over the top, forced and unoriginal, his performance is the most accurate to the source material since Nicholson's performance in the coveted 1989 Batman. (That's not to take anything away from Ledger masterwork, his Joker worked for those films, but would not ""work"" in this new DC movie universe.) The Joker was outlandish, brash and sadistic. That is what we should expect from The Joker in every aspect. Leto's take on the role was a masterpiece of method acting and paying homage to the source material while putting his own unique flare on this monumental character. He had some pretty big shoes to fill, and fill them he did.For a supporting role in a movie about a group of bad guys saving the world to literally steal the show with every moment (of which there were far too few) he had on screen, says a lot about Leto's Joker. Especially with the group of high profile actors he had to contend with.That said, the one character I thought did not ""work"" was Deadshot. For a character with such a pivotal role in the central story line, Will Smith's performance, for me, fell flat. I didn't feel any connection at all to the character despite all of the drama they attempted to stuff into the story surrounding the character. Meanwhile, almost every other character, even slipknot felt more ""real"" for the limited time (and what a waste...) we got to see him.Then there is Harley Quinn...I don't feel like enough can be said about Margot Robbie's performance or her take on the character. I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just use one word: Brilliant.The story was not at all what I expected. For the major villain to be one of the villains themselves, seemed to me a bit contrived, but it worked. The Enchantress was as evil and nasty as one might expect, even if they did seem to take the creepy chick crawling out of the TV on The Ring as inspiration for the character.In the end, I give the movie a solid 8, if just for some of the characters falling flat, and really...I believe Will Smith was just miscast for the role of Deadshot. I think I'd have rather seen someone like Jason Stathom for the role. Though he was a bit one dimensional and did a disservice to the movie, he didn't ""ruin"" the movie. There was plenty in the other characters to more than make up for his flat performance.I will not delve into the plot, or spoil the story any further. See it for yourself and judge as you will. I completely enjoyed the film, and will be seeing it again.-L",Suicide Squad
2330,pawawesome,Where to begin with this?,1,7 September 2016,"Personally I didn't like this movie at all. I think it was longer than it needed to be and had pointless added content that didn't need to be there. I understand that they needed to give backstory but it seemed it was more of a Harley Quinn Movie than it was all the characters as a whole. But also I don't like how they designed the mission. My other thing is The Joker, I didn't like the guy who played him. Trust me I understand that there will never be another Joker like Heath Ledger but I don't think he did a good enough job to follow such an actor. All in all I just didn't like this movie and what it had to offer. I personally am disappointed I spent any money to see this at all.",Suicide Squad
2331,micaelanmanschula,review,6,7 September 2016,"Overall the movie was great but the hype was overrated. The previews and trailers made it seem like that Jared Leto or the Joker was going to be apart of the Suicide squad and he is only on screen for 5 minutes. The action was downgraded in some scenes but it was a good movie. Just don't have real high expectations. Also the actors are great and so was the makeup. The best part of the movie is towards the end because that is where most of the action is. Be prepared to kind of awe yourself with some boredom because some of the scenes were like that. Performance of the actors was really good, no one stood out or had less then any enthusiasm when playing their part. Cool thing about the movie is the tattoos on the joker from the previews and trailers that everyone has seen float around since the talk about this movie even existed. Again not that much screen time for the joker and the hype is not all there.",Suicide Squad
2332,onlyadimreflection,"Amazing acting, fascinating back story, and tragically bloated",2,8 September 2016,"This movie should have been the fourth in a series, at least. There should have been a Harlequin and Joker movie. They introduced a fascinating story line there that got about 5 minutes of explanation. Also there should have been a Batman and Dead Shot movie, a Japanese chick/army dude/ archaeologist chick movie and maybe even an El Diablo movie all coming before the Suicide Squad instead of cramming the back stories into the first 20 minutes of the movie like a rushed date. As it is, the Suicide Squad movie feels rushed and bloated at the same time. It was a hot mess that jammed way too much into a story where you didn't care about the characters because there was no base to them.",Suicide Squad

Don't bother.,1,13 September 2016,"As a person who runs a movie review site for Horror films under the name ""Nightmare Files"" and a huge Harley Quinn fan since 1993; I was Sickendd by this movie. Let's start with the easy ones first. I will be including things that will spoil the movie for you. Sorry.spoiler alert:1. Origins: Harley's origin in New 52 aren't bad, but they could have been written better actually a lot better. Her original origins were she worked with Joker, he manipulated her, he was taken away deeper into Arkham, she robbed a costume store of many props and a jester costume. She voluntarily became Harley for him.2. Jared's joker was the worst portrayal of Joker that it made Batman and Robin's, and Batman Forever's casting look phenomenal. I couldn't tell if he was posing as Marilyn Manson who was posing as Joker or if he refused to be get off a male cellmate and got his teeth kicked in.3. Harley's Costume- it was originally knee high socks, a loafer style shoe, and a tight fitting corset, so why are we still promoting the movie version when even Margot Robbie said she despised the costume.4. Joker acted like a concerned boyfriend more than his abusive malicious self, which made the love they share look more enticing to younger viewers when Harley was actually suffering Stockholm syndrome from years of Jokers abuse. I mean he threw her out a building window into the trash receptacles below trying to kill her for catching batman.5. The studio wasted money on advertising that said it was movie of the year, no Deadpool was 750 Million and its got a sequel coming out may of next year or so I heard already.6. Deadshot and Harley never hook up and yet they do in the comics and Assault on Arkham. Meanwhile King Shark was replaced in casting by Killer Croc who had his debut in suicide squad back in the 80's and never had a appearance in the one with Harley.7. Deadshot in the comics shoots Harley in the stomach for putting jokers face on him, which was supposed to kill her but in this version there is no knowledge of that what so ever.8. Harley's broken Brooklyn accent never makes an appearance She sounds more British like than anything to me.This movie will make anyone who has read the comics very angry, they rewrote the entire thing and its not cute. I got refunded by the manager of my local movie theater after I saw it.",Suicide Squad
2335,hailee-95094,Suicide Squad is an UNCONVENTIONAL DC Universe film,8,5 October 2016,"Directed by David Ayer, Suicide Squad's main characters are six ""bad guys"" from the DC Universe who are chosen to go on a mission to save the world; making the film rather different when compared to the typical ""good guys versus bad guys"" DC Universe movie. Not only is the film an unconventionality by itself but it is also sheds light upon the unconventional relationship of Harley Quinn and the Joker. In their relationship they are completely against everyone besides each other. Although the relationship may be seen as abusive at times, especially on the Jokers part, he did anything and everything he could to save his Harley Quinn. It was apparent throughout the movie that the only real care that the Joker has is for Harley Quinn. In addition, despite Harley Quinn's nonchalant and unmerciful ways, she has and will always have a soft spot for the Joker. Their relationship is unlike any other but I feel that their love is pure and genuine, the way it should always be. Many viewers may say that director, Ayer, did a terrible job of making the plot apparent but he did a good job of depicting the love between the two villains.The relationship of Harley Quinn and the Joker introduces a whole new dimension to the story line of the movie",Suicide Squad

If however one views any film with a open mind, and remains undisturbed by a world depiction where the good and the bad are not easily discernible, changing back and forth throughout the course of the film, Suicide Squad is a treat. All the actors involved do a fine job portraying their characters, the film is well-scripted for its genre, and the special effects are not over- blown. The trick was always going to be completing the story-line without leaving too much out or becoming choppy sequentially during the editing process. In that the film succeeds. It is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but it is well done. The only real complaint comes from the film not including the song ""Ballroom Blitz,"" which was present in the early commercial trailers but is absent during the actual film. A minor inconvenience to be sure however once the song was included in those original trailers it became integral to the film. It makes one wonder what caused the song not be used. Oh well......",Suicide Squad

It was terrible. Some characters have such great potential to astound audiences, but all we got was a last minute, college edit of explosions. Man, I was lost from the start. Will Smith's opening line 'I'm going to make it rain down on ya' or something to that degree, let me know instantly, that this is un-doubtly poorly written.The JOKER'S character however was cool. His make-up, costume, creepy smile and all around wild persona really captured the essence of a comic book JOKER. It's a shame that 90 percent of his scenes however, felt like watching a heavy death metal music video then a DC movie. Such bad misdirection, better yet such bad screenplay. A peter Parker, Mary Jane relationship between Deadshot and Harley would've sufficed better then this nonsense of a messy, clunked story.What was with all the cinematic 'war preparation' music playing for the full run time? If you have yet to witness this ghastly excuse for a film and are considering buying the DVD when its released this Christmas. Then do so. Just don't expect any character development or character back story. Definitely do not expect a 'Dark knight' or any other DC movie for that matter. Except all the previous pathetic Superman films!

As a true DC Comic Fan Girl I have to say that the movie followed the comic, the characters were portrayed as they were in the comic and considering that mesh of the actors this movie is a great watch. I didn't get sucked into the movie, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good movie. The effects were a bit cheesy in a couple parts but the overall acting quality was good, the story line was a ""love story"" at the heart and I do feel that the ending was not what the viewers wanted by any means, since the woman isn't killed but as I stated before it does follow the ending of the comic. Personally, if you're a DC Comic fan then no matter what this movie is a great watch, if you're looking for Action and the ""superhero"" feel then you need to watch Captain America or if you're looking for more of a comedic movie then check out Deadpool but compared to those two Suicide Squad is a 6/10 but compared to the comic and viewing experience its a 9/10.",Suicide Squad

I really also thought their was no explanation on some points in the movie.But i like how it showed a lot of how they all dealt with their powers in their own unique ways.

Jared Leto was the worst joker to ever appear in screen, his costume design was poor and his laugh was just stupid.

2343,jr-30500,It was extremely enjoyable,9,27 September 2016,"Suicide Squad is a movie about a group of villains from the DC universe that are forced, by the government to go on a dangerous mission in order to save the world. The squad consists of: Harley Quinn, the girlfriend of the joker, Deadshot, an assassin for hire, Killer Croc, a man genetically modified to be like a crocodile, Captain Boomerang, an Australian bank robber, Enchantress, a thousand year old goddess, El Diablo, an ex-gangster, Slipknot, a professional cat burglar, and Colonel Rick Flag, a military man. There job is to go in and do impossible missions that they will more than likely be killed doing. If they don't comply then the government has bombs implanted into the squads heads in case they disobey orders or try to escape. This allows the government to force these villains to do their dirty work. The film was created by director David Ayer, who is known for creating war movies such as Fury to the first Fast and Furious movie. He did a great job with the film but there were some ups and downs through the movie but altogether it was a great film. For example, the costumes of the films were nowhere near what they were in the comics. The costumes that were created however definitely exceptional, along with the makeup done for Killer Croc. Then there was the scene where the audience saw Harley Quinn pulling on a shirt. I believe that this scene should have been left out as there is already plenty of oversexualization of women in the movie. The actors that were chosen for the production were excellent though, with Will Smith as Deadshot I found he truly embodied what Deadshot is and Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley Quinn was absolutely perfect. Then there was the plot and while not from the comic books it was well done and represented the darker side of DC that not many people are able to see because they focus on all the good in the DC world.",Suicide Squad

I rated it a 9 out of 10 because I really liked it and the characters were really well done .I liked the people that played them. I didn't give it a full 10 because some parts I didn't understand it. For the most part the movie really was entertaining and well made. I thought the ending could have been a little bit better, I liked how it showed kind of how everyone ended up though. My favorite part was when they showed how everyone was considered a villain. my favorite character was Harley quinn because she was funny & I just liked her character. I also liked the jokers character because he was so unexpected and you could never tell what he was going to do next. My least favorite character was the enchantress, I didn't like her I also didn't understand her purpose. Over all I really enjoyed this movie.",Suicide Squad

Funny, action-packed and FINALLY, well-edited, the Suicide Squad had plenty going for it. From the sexy and sassy Margot Robbie playing Harlequin to the nutcase antics of the Joker played by Jared Letto (I could stop there), or perhaps Will Smiths' smart-mouthed 'antagonist' Deadshot, the characters win the bun in this over the top pop-culture feast of a film. And when characters are put first, it's hard to go TOO wrong.

Suicide Squad can be something of a jumbled mess at times, and it's certainly not as unique or hilarious as something like Deadpool, but it's got plenty of charm, a great cast of villains, and a fun if somewhat silly plot. I had a good time from beginning to end, and the audience seemed to as well.All told, I think this is a good big screen movie. Plenty of fan service for comic book readers, and plenty for non-readers as well. Not everyone will like it, obviously, but I think you'll agree that this deserves much more than the 27% it's getting on Rotten Tomatoes. After all, the audience score there is at 74%, which feels like a much more reasonable assessment of the movie.I watched the original version of the movie online here--->http://turl.ca/prpsz",Suicide Squad

The joker is in this movie as much as he could be, it's called Suicide Squad not The Joker. I actually really liked the Jared Leto performance in this, he brought his own style to the table. Special effects were great too. i would have rated this movie a 10 if only Will Smith didn't take over the majority of the movie, let's be honest he's kinda a man-diva! all in all i loved the movie. Don't just take others word for the movie being bad and decide that it's too horrible to watch, go and watch the movie and judge for yourself, you may be surprised to find you actually like it.",Suicide Squad
2349,susanpinkston,Bad Movie Review on Suicide Squad,2,12 October 2016,"Movie Review: Suicide SquadSuicide Squad, is a poorly directed Marvel Comic Book action film, with ratings plummeting downwards rapidly shortly after the release date. This movie premiered in theaters on August 5, 2016. It was anticipated to be one of the best comedy action films of the summer, targeting comic-book readers and teens. Since the cast was very well recruited, such as actress and model Margot Robbie, actor and entertainer Will Smith, actor and singer Jared Leto, and supermodel and actress Cara Delevingne.The director chosen for this film was poorly chosen. David Ayer, is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. He has written and directed many well-known movies such as Training Day, Harsh Times, Street Kings, End of Watch, and Suicide Squad. He specializes in action films, but didn't live up to the high expectations everyone had for Suicide Squad. Suicide Squad is a movie about a team of dangerous super villains assembled by a U.S. intelligence officer on a top- secret mission to defeat a dangerous supernatural entity. Which was deemed to be a ""suicide mission."" They were fully armed with special weapons and government technology and security. With no escape route for any of the villains Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and The Joker (Jared Leto) had an abusive, obsessive, controlling, and sick relationship. Having that the joker escaped the mission without his beloved girlfriend, Harley. He had intentions of rescuing her, although he deliberately failed in doing so. Their love story threw off the focus of the movie. The movie itself had great music, editing, and action scenes. Although unfortunately these great assets didn't help with the direction of the movie. In the movie Will Smith's character Deadshot whose character first appeared in Batman #59 and was created by Bob Kane. Known to be the world's deadliest and most accurate marksman, Deadshot has become a permanent member of both the Suicide Squad and Secret Six. Will Smith was the most suitable actor for the role. He has a history of being in many not just action films but all types of successful films. Ben Affleck plays Batman in this film. Ben is formally known for his big break in Good Will Hunting. He has had a successful acting career. He has been nominated and won many awards such as the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture, Academy Award for best picture, and more. Although there are many different actors who play Batman's role in other movies Ben Affleck had a different take on portraying his character to be one of the best Batman roles in history. Most Marvel films take place in New York City, DC comics have always set their most popular heroes in fictional cities, because it fits a specific background on each character. Suicide Squad is no exception to this rule. It does not take place in New York City but takes place in Midway City. Which is a fictional city, comparable to Chicago and is located in the Midwestern United States. The idea for Suicide Squad had started developing in early 2009. It had all the potential and time to be an unforgettable film for this summer. Although with a budget of $175 million, it grossed over $742 million dollars in revenue, it received lots of negative reviews and low ratings. The plot was crammed, the directing was slightly choppy, and the characters were poorly constructed Margot Robbie's character Harley who was the main focus. Which allowed her to have a great outcome and received lots of praise. Even though the movie received horrible reviews, some were good.",Suicide Squad
2350,jesuit-39815,Suicide squad was a great movie,10,4 November 2016,"The Suicide Squad is a covert black-ops government strike team under Task Force X. The team is partially made up of imprisoned super- villains who agree to serve as expendable agents on life-threatening top-secret missions for the United States Government. In return, after sufficient service, the prisoners are granted full pardons for their crimes.The Government does not officially acknowledge the existence of the Suicide Squad, and claims their missions as random supervillain attacks. In addition, there are other non-prisoner members such as Nemesis and Nightshade who participate in the team as part of individual arrangements. The Suicide Squad operate out of Belle Reve prison in Louisiana.To prevent members escaping in the field, the prisoners are shackled with explosive bracelets programmed to detonate a certain distance from the field leader, who also wears a remote control that can detonate or disengage the bracelets as desired. Typically the field leader will be either Rick Flag or Bronze Tiger.The group is largely run by Amanda Waller, although at times someone else will act as a cover for her, like when the existence of the Suicide Squad became public. The Suicide Squad has also occasionally left Task Force X and Governmental Control to work freelance. The Suicide Squad is a team of imprisoned super-villains who perform high-risk missions for the U.S. Government in exchange for commuted sentences. They are formally known as Task Force X. The team's actions are highly classified, and the government is able to deny any involvement by claiming that they are not responsible for the damages of a random super-villain attack. Their commander is Amanda Waller, who runs the organization out of Belle Reve prison. The Suicide Squad was created by Robert Kanigher and Ross Andru, first appearing in Brave and the Bold #25.

I would rate it a 9/10 if the cast Heath Ledger instead of Jared Leto. The rest of the cast was great but if they had Heath Ledger it would have been so much better. There was great sets and other stuff. Jared Leto didn't have as many positive vibes and really made the movie stretch on. They also could have had more scenes with The Flash, whose ""cameo"" was extremely short........... . .............. .............. ............. ...................... .......... .......... ........... ............ ................... ......... ........ ........ . ......... .......... ......... ... ..... ..... .... ........ ........... ........",Suicide Squad
2352,adamstaigan,Good Movie,5,18 October 2016,"Suicide Squad. It is an okay movie. It has no plot or theme though. Yes, I completely understand that, and they just go along with whatever they are doing. It was as of, it was not rehearsed that well. Now, I have picked very good characters to explain a little. 1) Harley Quinn. 2) Mr. J. 3) Deadshot. These 3 characters have shown a whole bunch of bravery, and honesty. Harley Quinn. Dr. Harleen Quinzel was a psychiatric intern at Arkham Asy Psychiatric intern at Arkham Asylum also a model student. She was assigned to Joker to do check-ups on him. Now, Harleen did what we expected her to do, she fell in love with Joker. She changed her lifestyle for Joker. She fell into a big thing of acid, and Joker tried to walk away, but he went after her and saved her. Joker. Just like any other villain, he tried to kill the good guy. But the thing is, Joker, is a jokester. He is a psychopath with a twisted humor. He has no superhuman abilities, but he uses his expertise in chemical engineering to create develop poisonous or lethal concoctions. He also includes a thematic weaponry, including, razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid spraying lapel flowers. Deadshot. A often hired assassin. He never misses a gun shot. The reason he is the way he is, is because his parents were the MOST powerful people in the world, and they were known to despise each other. After a short while, Floyd's mother claimed his mother to be ""too abusive"" that really meant ""Floyd, kill your father. He is too abusive."" I was deciding very carefully on what 3 to do, because I will not do all of them, that takes up too much space. From me, seeing the movie, I thought that the 3 main characters were those 3. But, it's also the amount of responsibility that takes action, when you are choosing to use these actions.There has been a lot of heat, about how Leto was an horrible actor as Joker. So, I made a comparison of Heath Ledger, and Jared Leto. I asked 3 different people whether they liked Jared Leto, or if they liked Heath Ledger. All 3 people said Heath Ledger. I asked my mom, Danielle (my sister's friends mom) and Sean (my sister's friends dad). Since they all had said Heath Ledger, I went on YouTube to search up Heath Ledger playing The Joker. I searched for Heath Ledger best Joker scenes. I finally came to an agreement why all 3 people had said Ledger. If you have seen 'The Dark Knight Rises' you will understand how good Ledger's acting was. Even with Heath Ledger's death, a lot of people would still choose Ledger. Leto was not as good as we hoped he would be. He was not in as much as the movie as we wished he would be. The movie director needed to put Leto in their more due to the fact that he is in most of the trailers, and that this also has something to do with him, because they would not put Harley Quinn in a movie without her love. (Joker) There was some parts that Leto was good at, such as when he was saving Harley from the lady that could blow her up if she tried to escape. But that did not go as planned. Joker saved Harley and the lady told Deadshot to take her down, and he never misses a shot, but he missed this one for the sake of Harley and Joker. Even tho Joker led Harley to believe that he was dead. I love Leto, but his acting could be a bit more better. These are both great actors, and I'm not trying to discriminate or anything, I just agree with the people that said that Ledger was a better Joker than Leto. With Ledger's death, more people have actually taken into consideration on how good of a actor he is. Like I said before, they are both amazing actors, but some are a little better than others, if they are alive or dead. Suicide Squad. Since it looks like it has not been rehearsed, a lot can say that this movie is not a good one to watch or own, because you will be disappointed by how it starts, or ends. There is no theme here, and there has to be a theme to have a good movie, and also a good plot. So, I suggest you don't watch it unless you want to end up disappointed.",Suicide Squad
2353,jefmbishop,cringe,4,21 October 2016,"Dialogue is so poorly written, it made me cringe all throughout the movie. Was the screen play adapted from a 14 year old's fan fiction?Plot was... was there a plot?I don't know if it's because of cut scenes, bad acting, or bad dialogue but the Joker is an utter disappointment. He should have just made a cameo at the end.Tip: just watch the fight scene at the end. It was the only entertaining part of the whole movie.I can only hope they pull a Thomas Edison with these movies. now that they have learned 10,000 ways not to make movies, they can finally make a proper one.P.s. did they get a discount on helicopter crashes? It seems like helicopter crashes were like half the movie",Suicide Squad

It seems like every time Zack Snyder is involved, the movie is a total travesty. I spent money on this... I spent money on Jupiter Ascending, but at least that movie was hilariously bad. Suicide is painfully bad. If you ever wondered what having a terminal illness feels like, take time out of your day to watch this garbage. The cuts are horrendous. They look like a three year old taped them together in post. Speaking of post, all the editing is just ugly. The movie is filled with neon, flashy colors, but its just so dark. Not plot-wise; the movie is literally way too dark. You can't even see what's going on most of the time. If you're planning on laughing at a horrible movie with some friends and happen to come upon Suicide Squad, you're better off binging all the Adam Sandler movies. That's saying a lot.",Suicide Squad
2355,robertking-49467,Dc comics's (1) worst movies of all time,1,4 January 2017,"Suicide squad was the most God awful movie I have ever scene out of the DC Comics universe. Director and writer David Ayer who directed (Fury) in 2014 and (End of Watch) in 2012; gave the movie to much rap music and low esteemed gangster remarks that shouldn't of been in the film . The story lacked plot and story. David Ayer also chose the wrong type of cast. I am not going to go into the movie details. All I can say to future dc fans going to watch the film, it's not the type of film you thought to expect. The company and people who designed this film were crazy. I personally believe Christopher Nolensville, who directed ( the dark Knight trilogy) and ( Man of Steel) should of directed the film because he gave his films story and meaning, but also it should of had the right cast for it and characters such as, Erin Richards (Harley Quinn), BEN Affleck (Batman), Cory Michael Smith (Joker), Amanda Seyfried ( killer frost), Jessica lucas ( Amanda Waller), Tom hardy (killer croc), Jason Clarke ( captain boomerang), and finally Scott Eastwood as (Dead Shot).",Suicide Squad

Suicide squad delivers in what is the birth of a trilogy of action adventure. The online chemistry slowly develops between the characters and Will Smith excels in the lead role. Each character develops their own set of relationship skills that support each other through out. OK some of the characters could have been given more lines and even wisecracks. Killer Crocs history should not have been edited out. A great movie go and enjoy for some fun easy on the intellect entertainment,Suicide Squad
2358,tabithahedge,Top of the Line,10,19 November 2016,"I watched this film yesterday (11/18/16) at school and I have to say that I wish I saw it when it first came out. It was absolutely fantastic, and not just from an overall movie watching experience stand point. All of the little elements that went into creating the universe really made the film what it was supposed to be. DC is notorious for its more dark settings and plots, and this film was no exception. in fact, in my opinion, it was more dark because it is about villains being the heroes. The director captured the extreme darkness of the plot by holding the vast majority of the story at night, with the main source of light being the spell that the Enchantress is performing in the distance. The light is also softer and more even, including during the final battle in the end. this keeps the focus on the characters and what they are doing, along with showing that there are no secrets. Also, most of the wardrobes are dark colors, like army greens and dark blues, paired with white or light gray. The exceptions are with Harley Quinn, Deadshot, the Joker and Amanda Waller. They are the headline characters, with Harley, Deadshot, and Waller being the three main characters, and their more colorful wardrobes help them stand out as such. In all of the other DC movies with the Joker, his wardrobe always consists of greens and purples, so I assume they kept that so in this film for continuity sake. Overall, this was a fantastic film from beginning to end. I love DC movies because of how real they feel and how dark they are. I love that the fact that even though this is a more comedic film it didn't take away from the overall dark and mysterious feel of the story. I would recommend this to anyone who likes both a dark movie and a comedic one.",Suicide Squad
2359,zitro-44169,Lazy Writing.,1,20 November 2016,"This movie was embarrassing to watch. The plot was sloppy and the fight scenes were placed for no reason other than to show off the characters. Also, the characters where poorly written. Harley Quinn, for example, had so much potential to bring an important conversation about manipulative relationships but, instead, we're given a girl with messed up eyeshadow who probably watches too much anime. Also, what was the point of Katana, Killer Croc, and Captain Boomerang if the movie only focused on Deadshot and Harley? Katana and Killer Croc had no depth or any screen time. For Diablo, his character progress was lazy. He showed no involvement so his sudden sacrifice that ""brought the group together"" was too random. Deadshot was the one who proved to have some thought put into his character. I can go on about the disappointing characters but, honestly, I would be sounding like a broken record. Don't get me wrong, the concept of super heroes have potential to be great. The comics prove to have strong social commentary and character depth. But the movies? They are really only made for product and sales. I mean, why else would they only focus on the fact that they have so many well-known actors in one movie?",Suicide Squad

2362,esspilker,"Not Great, Not Horrible",6,13 December 2016,"Recently I went out to the movies and saw the film ""Suicide Squad"". Overall I enjoyed the movie a lot but there were also some critical errors. Before seeing the movie, I had watched previews of it and in the previews there was pretty much non-stop action. After seeing how good the commercials were for the movie, I thought that the whole movie was going to be non-stop action when in reality the movie was very slow to pick up and there was not nearly as much action in it as the previews had suggested, they had just put the all the small pieces of high intensity action into the couple minute previews, creating a lot of hype for the movie when in reality it was not like the previews at all. Another thing that I did not like about this film was how they sexualized Harley Quinn in it. Her costume consisted of a belly shirt that read ""Daddy's Lil Monster"", sparkly booty shorts and fishnet stockings. This portrayed her as a highly sexualized character and distracted from her story line, or lack of it. I also thought that the music choice for this film is one of the only good decisions they made. The entire film was full of songs that the audience would be excited about, such as Bohemian Rhapsody, so instead of organically creating the excitement the director stole the hype from the song. There were a couple things I did like about this film such as the intense special effects. With any superhero movie there must be amazing special effects and this movie did just that. My favorite part of the film was when ""El Diablo"" a character in the film whose power was that he can control fire was when he turned into a giant fire monster and fought the bad guy in the end. I thought that they did a good job on the effects for his character in that part of the film, it was very detailed and intricate and I was sad when he died. Another scene with good special effects was when they were all in the helicopter heading toward the center of the city to stop the Enchantress, and the helicopter was hit and they all went down. This scene was very detailed was captivating.",Suicide Squad

And director who let those scenes played out in this lazy, blend and just plain bad manner should crawl to some dark hole and stay there for the good of man kind. I strongly advice just not to waste your time watching this. It would left You just with the feeling of 2 lost hours that You will never get back.

2364,georgesimmo,"Trying too much, accomplishing too little",3,18 December 2016,"DC's Suicide Squad was set to become one of the company's greatest triumphs when it came to the Detective Comics Extended Universe (DCEU) by proving that both a more humorous and smaller scale story could end up as a universally applauded, financially successful effort. Unfortunately, the reality is that this not-so-small band of anti-heroes stars in a movie just as dark, dreary and problematic as DC's previous 2 attempts (Man of Steel and Batman v Superman). What could have truly stood out above the rest as a fun, zany and self aware flick quickly deteriorates into a bland, erratic and (dare I say) boring mess.The film's changes haven't been for the better, as this is yet another movie in a succession of DC's superhero properties that has received mainly negative reviews from critics. David Ayer, has recently come out amid-st the critical panning of the blockbuster, saying that 'this cut of the movie is my cut, there's no sort of parallel universe version of the movie, the released movie is my cut', meaning that he either really believed that this project was ready for audiences, or that he likes making money/movies and doesn't want to make any enemies with whoever's decision it was to alter his original vision. Either way, there are many aspects of Suicide Squad that clearly were ready to hit the mark, but end up going well wide. Elements feel completely unfocused and muddled, such as the bizarre tonal shifts between fun and wacky to dark and unearned emotional scenes.The phrase 'quality over quantity' is thrown away as soon as the movie begins. We are slowly introduced to the aforementioned Harley Quinn and Deadshot (Will Smith) before a rapid fire recap of the following 3 (it could have been 4 or 5 for all I can remember) members of the team that take up less than half the time of either of the first two. Thirty minutes later, Kitana and Slipknot are added to the gang even less ceremoniously, with the movie seemingly forgetting that they existed, as the audience soon will. The problem is that we are given too much, and none of it is any good. It's like getting an all you can eat buffet when everything's made out of wet bread and month old tuna, with only a fifth of the cutlery being clean representing how many of the film's jokes that make you laugh. Harley Quinn and Rick Flag's relationships with the Joker and June Moone, respectively, are glossed over, and never show any starting points or development with the pairings and instead jump to the end.This wouldn't be such an issue if their bonds weren't made increasingly important throughout the film, with Harley and Joker constantly trying to reach each other, and Rick Flag's entire motivation to stopping Enchantress. The only addition to either of these is seen with a flashback halfway through the film, is where Harley falls into a vat of chemicals and the Joker then dives down to save her, all of which comes across as something straight out of a 14-year-old girl's fan fiction and doesn't explain anything about why Harley is who she is or why she's suitable to be on the team. In fact, no one except Deadshot and El Diablo should be there, since the rest seemingly can't do anything that's more effective than the military men that we see can do. What use is a baseball bat or a boomerang compared to an assault rifle?The story doesn't fare any better, considering that it joins the club of movies where the baddie(s) hate humans for being humans and find a way to sent a giant light, often blue, into the sky in order to create a doomsday event (think Avengers: Age of Ultron, Man of Steel, Fantastic 4 and others). The villains' motivations are never elaborated on other than that they used to be worshiped (which we are told, not shown) and now humans are obsessed with technology instead, a point that is never developed or made again in order to be considered a true satire or take on the idea.The main positive of Suicide Squad comes from it's cast, who all clearly demonstrate a great passion and drive to make the film work. Will Smith effectively does what he does in all of his movies, play Will Smith, but that's fine because he's such a naturally likable, charming and witty person. Margot Robbie is clearly having fun playing such a twisted and random character, as she always has a specific energy that keeps you unsure of what she'll do next. The biggest surprise for me (and most from what I've seen) is what Jai Courtney turns in for Captain Boomerang, as he dominates the pool of comedic moments (which are few and far between) and isn't playing the same generic action movie lead that we've seen in, Terminator Genesys and A Good Day to Die Hard. Viola Davis does good work as Amanda Waller by creating a commanding presence that dominates the room in all of her scenes. Jared Leto also does a good job of showing the Joker in a new light as a fully blown, well respected mafia boss, a portrayal almost certainly chosen in order to create distance from Heath Ledger's take. However, there simply isn't enough of him to really see what he can do with the character, which is very disappointing considering how much work Leto reportedly put into method acting the character over the course of the production. As well as the performances, the inclusions of other characters in the film's universe such as Batman and The Flash are, while brief, a nice way of demonstrating a link between the several movies in this world that they are building.",Suicide Squad

Many people believed that the movie jumped around a little too much from scene to scene, which I do somewhat agree with. However, it did not drastically effect my overall judgment of the movie.

2369,sabrinaaj,This Movie Hates Harley Quinn Fans,1,26 December 2016,"This movie has lots of problems. Shoddy editing, nonsensical plotting, a random soundtrack whose only saving grace is the track by Twenty One Pilots (which isn't even in the movie proper, they shove it into the ending credits), etc. But the biggest problem with this movie & the reason why I consider it the worst film EVER to be based on any DC Comics property is the utter lack of understanding in regards to Harley Quinn. Film Harley has only the most superficial of traits associated with the real Harley Quinn and possesses none of her charm or depth. Yes, the real Harley Quinn is pretty and quirky, but what sets her apart from all the other cutesy psychos in fiction is her tragic side. We sympathize with her pain & struggles at the hands of Joker & want to see her overcome these obstacles and cast Joker aside. This film, on the other hand, glosses over all of that (even though the DCCU claims it's trying to be more mature) in favor of romanticizing an abusive relationship & turning one of the best female super-villains of all time into a groupie who doesn't even wear a real costume or brandish any sort of intimidating weapon. Film Harley isn't a real character, she's a piece of eye candy made to sell ""Daddy's Little Monster"" t-shirts. They wasted Margot Robbie's talent by giving her a shallow role & they wasted my time & money with two hours of the camera ogling at a girl in booty shorts & a tank top claiming to be Harley Quinn. She is not Harley Quinn and this movie is not good.",Suicide Squad
2370,douglasmiller-07151,Zero If I could. Worse than B V S,1,7 January 2017,"This film is poorly paced, poorly written and broken. I mean I Hate Everything's video completely sums up my points. The characters have barely any development the CGI is 2012 levels of poor, you wonder why Batman and Flash didn't help out. The only two characters not making m e want to stop watching were THE MAN WHO CAN CLIMB ANYTHING and Captain Boomerang. I just, really despise this film and, no, Batman Vs. Superman is not worse that film at least have moments. So, yes, the movie sucks. Attack me for my opinion, tell me to kill myself, whatever, I don't care if you take it to those lengths, you have issues being as attached to this movie as you are.

2371,mk-85786,A Love Story?,10,25 January 2017,It was a great joy watching this movie as I always took it to be a love story between Harley Quinn and the Joker. Margot Robbie played Harley Quinn and I love her innocence. She portrayed Harley as a friendly but edgy woman that was trying to get through life. Harley seemed like she wanted to learn about love and being social. Like she wants to learn how to live in this world. Loved all of Harley Quinn's innocent moments. The Joker was plain crazy as usual and that's what I expected and loved about him. The interactions between him and Harley were heart felt. I don't know if I can mention a line from the movie here but it was something that I always want to remember. It made me think about the very few relationships I had or tried to have lol. Hearts and emotions should be taken seriously because everyone isn't a threat or trying to damage you. There are some innocent people in this world and I know because I am one of them :).,Suicide Squad
2372,jberntson-62423,I genuinely have no idea why people like this garbage,1,4 July 2018,"While many people will probably disagree with me I am not changing my opinion that this was the worst film of 2016... by far. Yes it's worse than Nine Lives, Norm of the North and Gods of Egypt. This is mainly due to the fact that it is a confused mess and that is mainly due to the amount of edits and re-edits it has had. Many have said this was a production nightmare with absolutely no control. It is known that there were three main edits that were made for this film. One was approved by the Director (David Ayer), One was edited and approved by a studio that makes movie trailers, and the final edit was a mix of the two previously mentioned. Whoever's decision it was to put the third edit I mentioned in theatres must have been absolutely hammered that day. This particular edit leads to problems that include the worst pacing that a film has ever had, editing that looks dull at points or flashy and tacky the next minute, a first act that feels like a bunch of trailers mix mashed and jammed together (not to mention this is all while three people are eating steak). This combination leads to underdeveloped or non existent character arcs.Even if the editing and pacing were good the movie would still be god awful because the story makes no sense, the plot is beyond predictable and boring, and the characters all grated on my nerves (except deadshot because he was boring). Overall this movie is unbearable for me.",Suicide Squad
2373,TopSecretive,Enjoyable Watch on a Good Entertainment System,8,19 February 2017,"Just wanted to say that I think people need to post how they watched a movie in order for us to take the review seriously, I mean this sort of a film looked awesome on my 55"" Sony Bravia in 3D with a surround sound setup, however if I was watching it on a 14"" laptop or 5m away from a small 32"" TV with no soundbar then it may not have been so appealing because this sort of audio visual movie is designed for maximum impact on a decent set up.Of course I can appreciate movies with an emotional content and a developed story, but these sorts of movies aren't the reason I bought a 55"" 4K 3D TV and have 5 full range B&W speakers. The fact was simply that while watching this movie on my awesome set up, my senses were so overloaded with the joy of the visuals, the booming soundtrack and explosive effects that at no point did I ever feel like questioning anything.So if you didn't find this thoroughly enjoyable because you didn't watch it on a decent set up then maybe you need to go shopping or just stay away from action/sci-fi movies.

This movie would score higher if it didn't take such a cool premise and just waste it with the story that makes no sense, the glaring plot holes, the useless characters, pointless dialogue and exposition and more. The only thing going for it (and the reason it gets a 2 and not a 1) is Will Smith doing Will Smith stuff and some humor from Harley Quinn. which is all drowned out by stuff like: 'this is Kitana. she's got my back. i would advise not getting killed by her. her sword traps the souls of its victims.'it took a cool premise and cool characters that all could have had their own movies but jammed all of them in one. this could easily have been stretched into 6+ movies before this was made with all the cool characters they had in this. it tries too hard to rush an ensemble movie without us knowing or caring about anyone in it. and don't get me started on how useless and edgy the joker is in this.",Suicide Squad

I came in with three expectations: 1 - That the had both action and comedy 2 - That the characters felt right 3 - That when it was over I was satisfied and had funThe film accomplished all of those in my opinion. Many of the reviews state that they couldn't care about the characters in the film. I disagree with that, as anyone who has real issues in their life can easily relate to Deadshot, Harley, and even Diablo's situations. The main characters have their flaws and mistakes, and the film showed that well if you bothered to pay attention. They were villains true but they were people too. The action was also fun too, a lot of shooting, magic, and smashing. Good stuff. And comedy was sprinkled throughout gave quick laughs that felt right with some of the unhinged characters. The main bad guys weren't anything too special true, but it is a superhero movie...all bad guys have their clichés.If you came in expecting super high brow entertainment with mastery writing and Oscar performances galore you were bound to be disappointed.

Have the irrelevant ones (everyone but the Joker) manipulated by a Nick Fury archetype, taking away the need to build characters beyond a minimum and have them all play blindfolded catchphrase darts while alternately portraying them as deadly and inept, whenever convenient. Throw them into the plot of a Mummy sequel part way through, use the action from a God Of War game, and finish up with the ubiquitous threat of the evil hole of light in the sky.

2393,n_schoenike,"As entertaining as it still is, it was quite a disappointment.",6,31 August 2017,"(Possible spoilers ahead, read at your own risk) As a hardcore Batman/comic/movie fan, this was quite a disappointment. Mostly due to the Writing and editing. The thing that gets me the most is the fact that the trailers advertise a completely different movie. What I expected from the trailers was a dark and gritty action movie peppered with subtle humor for good measure. What I got was a rushed, bloated Hollywood, CGI filled cash grab. I don't think it started out that way, since David Ayer is a talented film maker in my opinion, but I believe once producers and the studios got involved, they focused too much on what many movies suffer from today... Making money. They wanted to market it to as wide of an audience as possible and that was they're mistake. instead of a simple engaging story with insanely interesting characters, we got a mess.Don't get me wrong, it has it's good points. the action is fun, even if it's a bit choppy. The cast and performances were well done for the script they had to work with, and the costume, makeup and general look of the film was great. that's about it. I thought Margot Robbie and Jared Leto were the best things this Movie had going for it and most of their scenes together were in flashbacks, which would have worked if their story was the focal point of the film, but it really had nothing to do with the plot. it's like they were just thrown in the movie because they are the two most recognizable characters.To close out this review, Joker should have been the main antagonist, pulling the strings to create a national threat, all simply to get Harley back, while Harley struggled with going back to Joker or realizing how bad he is for her and developing a new relationship with Deadshot, who would take the role as co protagonist along side Harley, instead of trying to make every member of the squad a main character and ending with no main characters, no one to root for, and an over complicated plot.The anticipation of this movie ended up disappointing me immensely and although I was still entertained, they just didn't get it right",Suicide Squad

I don't like how he looks, and i know comparing it to Heath Ledgers Joker isn't nice, because if i did, this Joker would lose on every front. A shallow, aesthetically superficial 'clown'. He wasn't even really much on screen. It even felt like a forced side story line.The main story isn't really interesting. I saw this movie a week ago, and I'm having trouble to remember it.

2396,jackclucas,Great cast but poorly executed,3,31 October 2017,"Firstly, let me say that this film is by no means bad. I'm not saying this is a good film either because, frankly, it isn't. It suffers from many of the same problems as Batman vs Superman. It has a weak plot with many holes in it. The film spends nearly half the time introducing its characters, yet I still found myself not caring whether they lived or died. There was no real threat for our 'heroes' as the stakes really weren't either high enough, or weren't enphasised enough. The CGI was terrible, with the enchantress' goons looking appalling. The story was some what cliché with them falling apart and deadshot doing his speech in the bar. Diablo also followed the mold eventually sacrificing himself. The enchantress reminded me more of someone from a strip club rather than a world threatening villain. Amanda Waller was a great addition to the DC universe, however even her character needed more development and work. Unfortunately, the joker wasn't the main villain as, and while this may be controversial, I found Jaret Leno's performance spell-binding. His take on the joker was great but the story was so poor that he could have been taken out and it would have ended with the same product. Most of the team members in the film would need an entire film to get their back story. Screen time was solely aimed towards Deadshot and Harley Quinn with them taking over at least 70% of the film. While Deadshot was not the ruthless assassin we all hoped for, he was acted brilliantly by will smith and DC really got the look they were going for. Margot Robbie was another example of great casting. She played a great Harley Quinn who was obsessed with the Joker and showed psychopathic tendencies throughout. Finally I want to congratulate Leno on his portrayal of the joker as if you watch all the deleted scenes, you see a lot more of him.",Suicide Squad

2407,sebbyshoulddie,When good source material goes bad!,2,24 July 2018,"Let me start this review by saying that I had high hopes for this movie (I don't really know why either). This film had a strange change in marketing as it got closer to the release which made me feel uneasy going in. Another thing that made me feel this way was the extensive reshoots. But still I went in open minded. Let me start out with what I liked. I enjoyed the soundtrack (outside of the movie) I will return to this subject in the bad. I also enjoyed some of the very brief moments between the squad that actually showed character. Now for the bad. 
#1-The soundtrack: the music tried to do all the heavy lifting that the script and the direction should've been doing. It tried way to hard to tell you how to feel. 
#2-The plot: the plot in the film is so thin that you can barely say there is a plot. It is also needlessly simple. 
#3-Film Structure: The Movie doesn't really have scenes. Sure it has the opening montage but that's what the movie ultimately is, a series of montages. There's a very long extended ""scene"" which is ultimately just the last three quarters of the movie when they're in the city. 
#4-Characters: the characters are not the characters we know and love. They are extremely misguided and the dialogue is so bad that it comes off almost as a spoof of these characters. They hired great talent such as Jared Leto who is surprising horrible in this movie. He is given nothing to do and you can tell in his performance how little help they gave him. Harley Quinn is also an issue. Margot Robbie is a great talent but she ultimately resorts to saying unfunny jokes and supplying the movie with endless shots of her butt. These great characters are stripped of everything that made them great to be one dimensional time wasters. 
#5-David Ayer: I feel like when David Ayer tries he can achieve greatness (Training Day, End Of Watch, Fury) but unfortunately he is so tired and unimaginative as a writer and a sleepwalker as a director now so he produces hot garbage. 
#6-Editing: The Editing In this movie is so jarring. It will randomly have Instagram video edit editing (if that makes sense) where there will Be neon colors on screen for no reason. Also the film has a tone problem. The movie was clearly heavily re-edited in post production. Basically how I feel is that maybe with a different writer & Director and without studio interference this could've been a great movie. However this is once again another dud for DC. When I write this don't think that I am some Marvel fanboy. I am not stranger to ripping one apart. I just enjoy watching good films and I don't settle for mediocrity. This is yet another example of when good source material goes bad.",Suicide Squad
2408,oliverskogsberg,This adio visual produckt is not a movie,1,8 May 2018,"The movie is about the ""bad guys"" kind of like guardians of the galaxy. It is actually very easy to notes the parallels it is suppose to be a ""fun"" ""action"" ""movie"". But it completely failed of beaing all three of those the fird beaing a movie. You can se that the 
It is simple to explain this movie it is so bad made with scenes without beginnings or ends and no substance. The movie is edited like a trailer NOT LIKE A MOVIE!!! The movie is not enjoyable this is becose the action is so bland and poorly made and the special effects are the same so you just can't enjoy the movie. The movie is not ""fun"" the characters are so flat that you don't like them or wath they are saying. Becose the dialogue is so dumb specely Harley Quinn's witch is suppose to be dumb I know her charakter but it is not dumb fun. And what is worse is that it's atatched to a bunch of really talented actors.
 This is yet another movie in the dc cinematic universe. I did not se bvs or Man of Steal so i did not get any of the warnings from the earlier dc movies. I wanted to watch this movie because I generally like batman and it's characters it's i watched asult on Arkham before I watched this movie to hype my selfe and that movie was good becose it was edited like a real movie.When I watched this my eyes wanted to jump out of my head and take a break. This movie I mean adio visuell product locks gray and it is filmed at night so you can't see anything. And when the creators relised this they decided to put some colourful filters over the cenes to make it look more colourful but instead it turned out to lock eawen worse.
To me I thaugth this movie took place in one of dc's manny parallel universes like the earth one becose the carakters are not the one from dc comics. The cakarakters in the movie are based on the caracters from dc comics except the peple who designed these carakters don't understand dc's carakters. The worst example of this is the joaker. In Batman the killing joke the joakers backstory was revealed and twist was that it was not the gas that made him mad but the nhyalism and therefore he trues to get he's message of that anyone can become a nhyalist if brungen to he's position. In this movie they just fought oh he is crazy so let's just make him that. Same thing with Harley insetead of making her karakter they just did her she is crazy and hot... that is it that is the levels of flat ckarakters where talking about.It is a chame that they made the karakters this becose this is why moast pepole like superherostorys.

So one day I watched it myself and after 30 minutes I already started to regret my decision. They had some cool actors like Will Smith or Margot Robbie but even they couldn´t save this movie.The characters were badly written, the story was completely uninteresting and also poorly written. They put a lot of effort in some characters and gave them a litte backstory-sequence and others didn´t receive nearly as much attention.This one guy, slipknot was only put in this movie so that they had someone to kill, and demonstrate that all the Suicide Squad members were really in danger because of these litte bombs inside their necks, the goverment injected them.So to all of you I can´t recommend this movie however thats just my opinion.",Suicide Squad
2410,michaelsturek,Suicide Squad a great action-comedy thriller!,7,31 May 2018,"By Michael SturekThe combination of characters throughout the DC comics into one movie, was an interesting experiment, but it was effective in the end. Suicide Squad directed by David Ayer featured an excellent soundtrack and cast, but it lacked a stable and exciting plot. The well chosen cast led by actor Will Smith was one of the first things I noticed in this action-comedy thriller. Smith portrayed the villain turned hero Deadshot, which was supported by famous actors, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Jared Leto as The Joker.  The movie begins with capturing and imprisoning of each of the villains. Each villain is given a thrilling backstory that sucks up the viewers attention. The imprisoned villains are visited by the lady in charge of Task Force X, Amanda Waller, which is portrayed by Viola Davis. Waller has assembled these villains into the expected disaster (at the time) Task Force X. The task force is led by a highly decorated Military Veteran Rick Flag played by Joel Kinnaman. Flag is dating Dr. June Moone, played by Cara Delevingne, who has the power to transform into an evil Queen, Enchantress, by whispering her alter ego ""Enchantress"". While on a mission Dr. Moone loses control of her alter ego, and Enchantress takes over, releasing her evil brother, Incubus. The Task Force X is sent in to destroy the threat on Midway City.  The director, David Ayer is a very established and successful director in the film industry. He is most famous for directing Suicide Squad, Bright, Fury, Training Day, and Sabotage. Ayer has been a director for more than 15 years and has made a name for himself. He draws in famous actors for both his large roles and supporting actors/actresses. In Suicide Squad, the lead role is portrayed by Will Smith as Deadshot. Smith has had a long acting career most famously in his role of Will Smith in the hit television show, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Smith's supporting actress Margot Robbie who plays Harley Quinn has appeared in many films, most famously in the films, Wolf of Wall Street, I, Tonya, and Focus, which also featured Smith.
 
 My favorite parts of the film were the cast, soundtrack, and the setting of the film. The soundtrack was created by, Steven Price. The soundtrack featured famous songs: ""Heathens"" by Twenty One Pilots, ""Purple Lamborghini"" by Skrillex and Rick Ross, ""Sucker For Pain"" by Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, and Imagine Dragons. The use of this excellent soundtrack added the needed emotion to the action scenes throughout this thriller. The initial setting of the film was in Toronto, Ontario. The final battle between the self declared Suicide Squad and the evil brother and sister duo occured in Midway City, which is modeled after the famous city Chicago, Illinois. The setting provided a realistic battle occuring in a large, important city. The director also used the weather to make the scene more dramatic and lively. Ayer brought the rain into the final battle scene which threw a new element into this already difficult battle. The genre of this film is action-comedy. The actors and scripts promote both action comedy. Many movies do not use this kind of tactic for an action movie, however Suicide Squad did an excellent job bringing both action and comedy together to form a great overall movie. Some other films that use this action-comedy genre are both Deadpool and Deadpool 2.  Suicide Squad combined many different characters from the DC comic universe and created an excellent action-comedy thriller. Although I am a big Marvel comic fan and have not explored the DC comics, this movie was an excellent introductory to the DC comics for me. I believe that this movie was excellent despite the difficult plot to follow, however the cast, soundtrack, and setting made up for the plot.",Suicide Squad
2411,christophermezerkor,good,8,24 October 2019,"Suicide Squad has such star power and superhero connections that I was going to watch it no matter what the user reviews said (I always disregard critic reviews as they rarely are helpful) and feel like many viewers were going to as well. The movie has cool set pieces, action scenes and fantastic costumes.",Suicide Squad

2413,mjaf-28448,What the hell??,1,17 September 2018,Jerard leto was painful to watch in this. I haven't seen such awful acting in a while. He tries to hard to be heath ledger.,Suicide Squad
2414,arturosanchezlazo,She's Harley and I miss Burton.,7,13 August 2019,"As a gamer and DC Fan, I have to say that Margot Robbie born to be Harley Quinn. I like her work because this Harley Quinn (Margot) was very similar to the Harley Quinn of the Arkham video games series.Maybe the problem with the movie was the script and I just felt that they wanted to be like MARVEL with all the coloring and sparkling things. I'm that kind of DC fan who likes the ""Tim Burton's Batman"", you know, the dark one, ""Not colored"".As a publicist I have to talk about a marketing rule ""Do always the opposite of your competition"", if Pepsi is blue, Coca-Cola is red. If Marvel is the ""color-fun"" then DC has to keep the dark style. Sometimes I just feel that DC directors just want to ""do it like Marvel"" and maybe they just have to keep the DC Dark Style.I guess everybody remembers the Batman Forever and Batman & Robin. Same mistake, same history, you put color and sparkling things on the Batman world and you will ruin it.I only put 7 to respect the Oscar this movie won and to respect the Margot Robbie Work.",Suicide Squad
2415,lbettinelli,Great movie!,10,13 September 2018,"I dunno what you guys are talking about. This movie was great and funny! The acting was really good, the costumes and makeup were amazing too. Yes the plot had some flaws, well guess what. That's cinema for ya. Y'all can hate this movie but learn to live a little at the movies.",Suicide Squad
2416,ecembilgin-98163,good for killing time,7,27 September 2018,"Was it awful? No. Was it marvelous? No. If you have some time to spend at home and can't find anything to do and want to laugh a little bit, it is good to watch this movie BUT I warn you not to have high expectations. Don't forget that you are just watching this movie because you don't want to say ""I haven't seen it"" and you want something a little funny. You don't need to think about it while watching, just catch the moment and you will understand everything very clearly. I quite like the soundtracks, they got stuck in my head for a while. Last of all, I recommend watching it without any expectation.",Suicide Squad
2417,jacobwood-94126,Top 5 worst movies I've ever seen,1,29 March 2019,"If you take the worst individual character plot lines from every movie you've ever seen, and amalgamate them together into one single, unifying incoherent plot, you have a film with more depth than Suicide squad.If you are looking for soft core porn then Margot's performance in this may meet that benchmark but this can be achieved with a YouTube highlight reel, you're welcome.",Suicide Squad

2420,scottmcaboy,Likeable,9,15 December 2017,"This movie has many redeeming qualities. Granted I did not have big expectations since the reviews were bad and I saw it at home. However, I was pleasantly surprised with its likability. Especially Margot Robbie, she did a great job creating an off stereo typical female role!I also have to give a lot of credit to the Music Supervisors; they really added a lot of genius to this movie. Much the way the soundtrack in Guardians of the Galaxy worked. The end was not great but I enjoyed many parts of this and respect the effort it took to make a big looking movie like this.",Suicide Squad
2421,erinburnsaud,Overall enjoyed,7,16 January 2020,"So the villian they were up against was meh, but honestly, what kind of villian can you put up against a team of villians really? But the Squad itself was fun. Though I think they wasted Diablo as a character.",Suicide Squad
2422,ayyyyylmao,Nothing worse than a boring movie,1,23 February 2019,"I was so impossibly bored during this movie... The story is bad, the characters are bad, the color palet of the movie is awful... Honestly nothing positive to come out of this.",Suicide Squad
